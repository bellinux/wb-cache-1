5|$|Flight Unlimited II is {{a flight}} {{simulator}} video game: its gameplay is a simulation of piloting real-world planes. Players may control the Piper PA-28R-200, de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, Beechcraft Baron 58, North American P-51D Mustang or Cessna 172. The interactive cockpit of each plane {{is based on}} its real-world counterpart, and it contains simulated flight instruments such as an <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator,</b> a heading indicator and a VOR indicator, among others. The player begins by engaging in a Quick Flight or by using the fixed-base operator (FBO) interface. In a Quick Flight, the player selects a plane and the flying conditions before taking off; the FBO interface features additional options, such as lessons, flight plans and adventures. The game's six lessons detail such maneuvers as takeoffs and taxiing. Adventures are pre-built missions, with objectives such as landing on an aircraft carrier, helping a prisoner to escape from Alcatraz Island or dropping turkeys into Candlestick Park. There are 25 adventures in total.|$|E
5|$|The player {{may choose}} to begin flight on a runway or taxiway, or in the air. Aircraft are {{controlled}} via keyboard, joystick, head-mounted display or specialized input devices such as pedals. During flight, several third- and first-person camera angles may be selected. For example, the third-person Flyby View places the camera {{in front of the}} plane as it flies past, while the first-person Three-Way View displays more information about the plane's position and speed than other angles. Certain camera angles, including the Three-Way View and 3-D Cockpit view, provide the player with simulated flight instruments such as an altimeter, <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator,</b> accelerometer, variometer and tachometer. The game is designed to allow players to perform aerobatic maneuvers such as the Immelmann turn, tailslide, Lomcevak and Cuban Eight. Performances may be recorded and played back, with controls that allow the player to pause, rewind and fast forward. At any time, the player may stop a recording and resume flight from that point.|$|E
25|$|Indicated {{airspeed}} (IAS) is the <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator</b> reading (ASIR) uncorrected for instrument, position, {{and other}} errors. From current EASA definitions: Indicated airspeed means {{the speed of}} an aircraft as shown on its pitot static <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator</b> calibrated to reflect standard atmosphere adiabatic compressible flow at sea level uncorrected for airspeed system errors.|$|E
25|$|Outside {{the former}} Soviet bloc, most <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicators</b> show the speed in knots (nautical {{miles per hour}}). Some light {{aircraft}} have <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicators</b> showing speed in statute miles per hour or kilometers per hour.|$|R
2500|$|This {{expression}} {{is based on}} the form of Bernoulli's equation applicable to a perfect, incompressible gas. The values for [...] and [...] are consistent with the ISA i.e. the conditions under which <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicators</b> are calibrated.|$|R
50|$|Aviation {{standards}} and flying rules {{are based on}} the International Standard Atmosphere. <b>Airspeed</b> <b>indicators</b> are calibrated on the assumption that they are operating at sea level in the International Standard Atmosphere where the air density is 1.225 kg/m3.|$|R
25|$|The forward pilot's cockpit {{was fully}} instrumented, with an <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator</b> capable of reading to 560km/h (350mph), {{gyroscope}} and an altimeter (useful to 8,000m/26,250ft).|$|E
25|$|True {{airspeed}} {{differs from}} the equivalent airspeed because the <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator</b> is calibrated at SL, ISA conditions, where the air density is 1.225kg/m³, whereas the air density in flight normally differs from this value.|$|E
25|$|Preliminary {{examination}} {{of data from}} the Flight Data Recorder shows that the <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator</b> failed, showing too low an airspeed. In response to this, the pilots increased {{the speed of the}} aircraft past VNE, the never exceed speed, and the aircraft then broke up in flight. Amongst the areas being covered by the investigation are pilot error and fuel quality. There was no call to ground from the An-148 following the accident.|$|E
25|$|Later {{the same}} year (1996), Aeroperú Flight 603, also {{operated}} with a Boeing 757, suffered a similar but far more difficult situation (static ports blocked by tape, rendering all <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicators</b> and pressure altimeters unusable) and crashed in the ocean off Peru.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Airspeed</b> <b>indicators</b> work by {{measuring}} the difference between static pressure, captured through one or more static ports; and stagnation pressure due to [...] "ram air", captured through a pitot tube. This difference in pressure due to ram air is called impact pressure.|$|R
50|$|From 1936 - 1943, {{the company}} is awarded a {{development}} and production program of cockpit instrumentation for the Swiss Air Force. REVUE THOMMEN develops and supplies altimeters, <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicators,</b> vertical speed indicators, clocks, and the landing gear for the Swiss multifunction biplane EKW C-35.|$|R
25|$|The {{measurement}} and indication of airspeed is ordinarily accomplished on board an aircraft by an <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator</b> ("ASI") {{connected to a}} pitot-static system. The pitot-static system comprises one or more pitot probes (or tubes) facing the on-coming air flow to measure pitot pressure (also called stagnation, total or ram pressure) and one or more static ports to measure the static pressure in the air flow. These two pressures are compared by the ASI to give an IAS reading.|$|E
25|$|Testing {{demonstrated}} {{a number of}} problems, notably a lack of horizontal stability, an underpowered trim system, landing gear {{that could only be}} extended at slow speeds, an unreliable <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator,</b> and a cramped cockpit. The test pilots also requested that six guns be installed. The stability problem was addressed on the second prototype by adding a triangular fillet {{to the front of the}} vertical stabilizer. The extra guns could not be incorporated due to weight and balance considerations.|$|E
25|$|After initial combat on 24 May (claiming two 'probable' victories), Gray had a {{share in}} his first {{confirmed}} enemy aircraft, a Messerschmitt Bf 109, on 25 May 1940, while escorting a formation of Fairey Swordfish to dive-bomb Gravelines. His Spitfire was badly damaged in the engagement, and damage to the port aileron forced the aircraft into a dive that was controlled only with great difficulty. His aircraft had also lost its <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator</b> and control of guns, flaps or brakes. Despite this damage, Gray managed to force land safely at Hornchurch.|$|E
50|$|This {{simplified}} form of Bernoulli’s {{equation is}} fundamental {{to an understanding of}} the design and operation of ships, low speed aircraft, and <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicators</b> for low speed aircraft - that is aircraft whose maximum speed will be less than about 30% of the speed of sound.|$|R
50|$|In simple aircraft, {{without an}} air data {{computer}} or Machmeter, true airspeed can be calculated {{as a function of}} calibrated airspeed and local air density (or static air temperature and pressure altitude, which determine density). Some <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicators</b> incorporate a slide rule mechanism to perform this calculation. Otherwise, it can be performed using this applet or a device such as the E6B (a handheld circular slide rule).|$|R
40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the results of}} the wind tunnel investigation of the pressure distribution on the flying mock-up of the Consolidated Vultee XP- 92 airplane. Data are presented for the pressure distribution over the wing, vertical tail and the fuselage, and for the pressure loss and rate of flow through the ducted fuselage. Data are also presented for the calibration of two <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicators,</b> and for the calibration of angle-of-attack and sideslip-angle indicator vanes...|$|R
25|$|The {{cantilever}} gulled wings followed {{normal practice}} with a plywood-covered torsion box leading edge, mainspar, ribs and false rear spar {{to support the}} full-span flaps and ailerons. DFS-style airbrakes were fitted {{at the rear of}} the mainspar with the upper plates hinging forwards and the lower plates hinging rearwards. A comprehensive instrument panel was fitted in the cockpit which included:-A large plaque on the instrument panel; <b>AirSpeed</b> <b>Indicator</b> (8), Vertical Speed Indicator to 5m/s, Vertical Speed Indicator to 15m/s, an artificial horizon with slip ball, altimeter, longitudinal clinometer, stopwatch, compass and oxygen pressure gauge (oxygen equipment was housed behind the pilots seat).|$|E
25|$|An <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator</b> is a {{differential}} pressure gauge with the pressure reading expressed in units of speed, rather than pressure. The airspeed {{is derived from the}} difference between the ram air pressure from the pitot tube, or stagnation pressure, and the static pressure. The pitot tube is mounted facing forward; the static pressure is frequently detected at static ports on one or both sides of the aircraft. Sometimes both pressure sources are combined in a single probe, a pitot-static tube. The static pressure measurement is subject to error due to inability to place the static ports at positions where the pressure is true static pressure at all airspeeds and attitudes. The correction for this error is the position error correction (PEC) and varies for different aircraft and airspeeds. Further errors of 10% or more are common if the airplane is flown in “uncoordinated” flight.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigation}} report {{stated that the}} weather conditions were a cause of the accident. During the approach to the runway the aircraft was operated slightly above the stall speed and {{a major change in}} wind speed could cause a stall. The aircraft experienced windshear. The altitude, the reaction time of the pilot, and the responsiveness of the aircraft combined to prevent the arrest of decent in time to avoid the accident. The crew did not adhere to any published approach procedure and they possibly misinterpreted the altimeter and <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator.</b> During the descent, the pilot in command did not check his approach chart and did not continually consult the first officer on the altitude and course. There was inadequate communication between crew, deficient Crew Resource Management, and no approach briefings were made for either of the two approaches. The aircraft was configured for landing with flaps fully down at a very long distance from the runway without having it in sight. The aircraft will not respond well to windshear in such a configuration. Both approaches require a circling procedure.|$|E
50|$|To {{maximize}} a pilot's {{understanding of}} how the hang glider is flying, most pilots carry instruments. The most basic being a variometer and altimeter—often combined. Some more advanced pilots also carry <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicators</b> and radios. When flying in competition or cross country, pilots often also carry maps and/or GPS units. Hang gliders do not have instrument panels as such, so all the instruments are mounted to the control frame of the glider or occasionally strapped to the pilot's forearm.|$|R
5|$|As {{reflector}} sight designs advanced after World War II, {{giving the}} pilot {{more and more}} information, they eventually evolved into the head-up display (HUD). The illuminated reticle was eventually replaced by a video screen at {{the focus of the}} collimating optics that not only gave a sighting point and information from a lead-finding computer and radar, but also various aircraft indicators (such as an artificial horizon, compass, altitude and <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicators),</b> facilitating the visual tracking of targets or the transition from instrument to visual methods during landings.|$|R
5000|$|On 20 December 2010, Airbus {{issued a}} warning to roughly 100 {{operators}} of A330, A340-200 and A340-300 aircraft, regarding pitot tubes, advising pilots not to re-engage the autopilot following failure of the <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicators.</b> Safety recommendations issued by BEA for pitot probes design, recommended that [...] "they must be fitted with a heating system designed to prevent any malfunctioning due to icing. Appropriate means must be provided (visual warning directly visible to the crew) to inform the crew of any non-functioning of the heating system".|$|R
25|$|Prototype #2 {{was never}} used for testing, and instead flown on 25 November 1957 to the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio. This {{aircraft}} {{had not been}} completed {{and none of the}} radio navigation systems had been installed. To fly it to the museum, Major Clyde Good intended to follow an F-100 being delivered the same day. After an en route refuelling stop the two aircraft became separated, and Good was forced to follow roads to the St. Louis area when it turned dark and overcast. The aircraft was not equipped with cockpit or instrument lighting, so Good periodically flicked his Zippo lighter to read the instruments. Guessing a heading, he flew close enough to Dayton to be seen on radar at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and was talked down to the runway. It was then that Good discovered that the landing lights had not been installed either, but he was able to successfully land the plane while using the Zippo to light the <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator</b> through the approach.|$|E
25|$|Equivalent {{airspeed}} (EAS) {{is defined}} as the speed at sea level that would produce the same incompressible dynamic pressure as the true airspeed at the altitude at which the vehicle is flying. An aircraft in forward flight is subject to the effects of compressibility. Likewise, the calibrated airspeed {{is a function of the}} compressible impact pressure. EAS, on the other hand, is a measure of airspeed that is a function of incompressible dynamic pressure. Structural analysis is often in terms of incompressible dynamic pressure, so that equivalent airspeed is a useful speed for structural testing. At standard sea level pressure, calibrated airspeed and equivalent airspeed are equal. Up to about 200 knots CAS and 10,000 ft (3,000 m) the difference is negligible, but at higher speeds and altitudes CAS must be corrected for compressibility error to determine EAS. The significance of equivalent airspeed is that, at Mach numbers below the onset of wave drag, all of the aerodynamic forces and moments on an aircraft are proportional to the square of the equivalent airspeed. The equivalent airspeed is closely related to the indicated airspeed shown by the <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator.</b> Thus, the handling and 'feel' of an aircraft, and the aerodynamic loads upon it, at a given equivalent airspeed, are very nearly constant and equal to those at standard sea level irrespective of the actual flight conditions.|$|E
25|$|At Lindbergh's request, {{the large}} main and forward fuel tanks {{were placed in}} the forward section of the fuselage, in front of the pilot, with the oil tank acting as a firewall. This {{arrangement}} improved the center of gravity and reduced the risk of the pilot being crushed to death between the main tank and the engine {{in the event of a}} crash. This design decision meant that there could be no front windshield, and that forward visibility would be limited to the side windows. This did not concern Lindbergh as he was used to flying in the rear cockpit of mail planes with mail bags in the front. When he wanted to see forward, he would slightly yaw the aircraft and look out the side. To provide some forward vision as a precaution against hitting ship masts, trees, or structures while flying at low altitude, a Ryan employee who had served in the submarine service installed a periscope which Lindbergh helped design. It is unclear whether the periscope was used during the flight. The instrument panel housed fuel pressure, oil pressure and temperature gauges, a clock, altimeter, tachometer, <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator,</b> bank and turn indicator, and a liquid magnetic compass. The main compass was mounted behind Lindbergh in the cockpit, and he read it using the mirror from a women's makeup case which was mounted to the ceiling using chewing gum. Lindbergh also installed a newly developed Earth Inductor Compass made by the Pioneer Instrument Company which allowed him to more accurately navigate while taking account of the magnetic declination of the earth. Lindbergh's ultimate arrival in Ireland deviated from his flight plan by just a few miles.|$|E
50|$|The true {{airspeed}} {{can be calculated}} {{as a function of}} equivalent airspeed and local air density, (or temperature and pressure altitude which determine density). Some <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicators</b> incorporate a slide rule mechanism to perform this calculation. Otherwise, it can be performed with a calculator such as the E6B handheld circular slide rule. For a quick approximation of TAS add 2% per 300m / 1000 feet of altitude to IAS (or CAS). e.g. IAS = 52 m/s /100 Knots. At 3000 m / 10,000' Above Sea Level, TAS is 62 m/s / 120 Knots.|$|R
50|$|Copter, Plane, Rover or Sub {{software}} runs {{on a wide}} variety of embedded hardware (including full blown Linux computers), typically consisting of one or more microcontroller or microprocessor connected to peripheral sensors used for navigation. These sensors include MEMS gyroscopes and accelerometers at a minimum, necessary for multirotor flight and plane stabilization. Sensors usually include, in addition, one or more compass, altimeter (barometric) and GPS, along with optional additional sensors such as optical flow sensors, <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicators,</b> laser or sonar altimeters or rangefinders, monocular, stereoscopic or RGB-D cameras. Sensors may be on the same electronic board, or external.|$|R
40|$|Review of {{a program}} for the {{development}} of advanced fluidic components and the application of these components to general aviation instrumentation and control. The major project in this category has been the development of a simple, reliable, two-axis autopilot for light aircraft, using a fluidic inertial rate sensor for stability and roll attitude control, and a simple magnetometer for azimuth reference. This autopilot has been succesfully flight-tested. Fluidic hardware developed for this autopilot is described, and projected improvements and extensions are discussed. Application of fluidic components to such flight instruments as turn coordinators, artificial horizons, and true <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicators</b> is explored...|$|R
500|$|The <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator</b> is {{connected}} to both the pitot and static pressure sources. [...] The difference between the pitot pressure and the static pressure is called dynamic pressure. The greater the dynamic pressure, the higher the airspeed reported. A traditional mechanical <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator</b> contains a pressure diaphragm that {{is connected}} to the pitot tube. [...] The case around the diaphragm is airtight and is vented to the static port. [...] The higher the speed, the higher the ram pressure, the more pressure exerted on the diaphragm, and the larger the needle movement through the mechanical linkage.|$|E
500|$|... 6 February 1996 – Birgenair Flight 301 {{crashed into}} the sea shortly after takeoff due to {{incorrect}} readings from the <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator.</b> The suspected cause is a blocked pitot tube (this was never confirmed, as the airplane wreck was not recovered).|$|E
500|$|Bird strike – A {{fortnight}} {{after the}} accident the mutilated body of a large bird was found on Seven-Mile Beach. [...] It was considered the bird, which had a wingspan of about 6ft (1.8m), may have struck the aircraft cockpit, distracting or incapacitating the pilots. Alternatively, the bird could have struck the aircraft's pitot tube, damaging it and causing inaccuracy in the <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator.</b>|$|E
50|$|None of the Soviet-designed {{aircraft}} at Tonopah flew in {{bad weather}} or at night. All were very short-legged, compared to contemporary US aircraft, and sorties were limited to 20 minutes or so. The MiGs had US <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicators</b> {{and a few other}} minor instrument and safety modifications. Other than that, they were stock—down to their Warsaw Pact paint jobs. Two pilots of the 4477th died flying the Soviet planes. The pilots had no manuals for the aircraft, although some tried to write one. Nor was there a consistent supply of spare parts, which had to be refurbished or manufactured at high cost.|$|R
5|$|Like most flight {{instructors}} giving dual instruction, Reid {{was seated}} on the right side, while the aircraft's primary flight instruments were mounted on the left, in front of Dubroff in this case. Investigators speculated {{that because of the}} heavy rain in his immediate climb path, Reid's forward visibility became greatly restricted. To maintain control through the climbing right turn, {{he would have had to}} turn his head to the left to see the flight instruments (most critically the attitude and <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicators)</b> and to the right to see the ground through the side window. Such side-to-side head motion, combined with the worsening flight visibility during the climb and the reduced stall margin, could have led to spatial disorientation and loss of control.|$|R
5000|$|The {{flight was}} on an {{approach}} speed far below the recommended parameters. The instruments most likely gave inaccurate readings, causing the crew to reduce speed before touching the runway led to a hard landing. Examination of the <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicators</b> showed that the indicators themselves were functional, but flight tests showed that changes cabin pressure affected the pressure in the full-pressure pipeline of the speed indicator used by the co-pilot and the navigator; resulting in an overstatement of the speed ranging from 17 to 80 km/h. While simulating the flight to {{determine the cause of}} the erroneous indications, the depressurization happened approximately three minutes after turning off the cabin pressurization. The probability of such events occurring during descent was supposed to be 0.000001%.|$|R
