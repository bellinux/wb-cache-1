5000|$|<b>Atlas</b> <b>silk</b> or Etles Silk ( [...] ,) {{is a type}} Ikat Uyghurs {{used only}} for woman's clothing. It is kind of silk {{produced}} by the atlas moth. One of the largest sites of production is China's far western city of Hotan, and surrounding towns in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.|$|E
5000|$|Traditional Uyghur {{wine from}} Xinjiang {{is known as}} museles (Arabic: , lit. [...] "the triangle"). Its {{production}} requires crushing the grapes by hand, then straining them through <b>atlas</b> <b>silk</b> and boiling the juice with an equal volume of water, as well as added sugar. This is cooked until the original volume of the juice is reached and then stored in clay urns along with various flavorings.|$|E
5000|$|China's Xinjiang Autonomous Region have {{an ancient}} history of {{viticulture}} {{going back to}} around the 4th century BC, when Greek settlers brought the vine and more advanced irrigation techniques. The area around Turfan was, and still is, particularly noted for its grape production, and production of grape wines is mentioned in the historical record as well; Marco Polo mentioned that Carachoco (the name he used for Turfan) produced fine grape wines.

The brew usually takes more than a month to accomplish. It is then un-urned, filtered and bottled to be storred for long periods.

40|$|Abstract. Natural brown silk {{biomaterial}} from silkworm Attacus atlas L. (A. atlas L.) is a biopolymer {{that has}} many advantages compared to commercial silk from Bombyx mori (B. mori). The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the cytotoxicity of A. <b>atlas</b> L. <b>silk</b> on rat smooth muscle cells with the direct method of methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay compared to commercial surgical suture silk. The result showed that brown colored natural silk has low cytotoxicity as same as commercial surgical suture silk with slightly lower cell viability. It was found that A. <b>atlas</b> L. <b>silk</b> potentially can developed to be surgical suture thread as a new expectation of biopolymer material in biomedical products...|$|R

5000|$|China's Xinjiang Autonomous Region have {{an ancient}} history of {{viticulture}} {{going back to}} around the 4th Century BC, when Greek settlers brought the vine and more advanced irrigation techniques. However new archeological evidence has shown this to be untrue, because China produced grape wine, rice wine, mead (honey wine) 9000 years ago (7000 BC). The area around Turfan was, and still is, particularly noted for its grape production, and production of grape wines is mentioned in the historical record as well; Marco Polo mentioned that Carachoco (the name he used for Turfan) produced fine grape wines. The modern wine industry is largely patterned after French methods with a concentration on varieties like Cabernet. However, the Uighur traditional technique has survived especially in counties surrounding Kashgar. The Uighur home-made wine generally called [...] "museles" [...] (from Arabic [...] "المثلث [...] ", meaning [...] "the triangle") is still being brewed by households in many villages.

40|$|Attacus atlas are insects {{producing}} silk materials having high economic value. It {{lives from}} South East Asia, almost all Indonesia until Australia. The demand of silk from Attacus atlas is quite high (10 tons/month). The A. <b>atlas</b> <b>silk</b> is very exclusive, with permanent in variety colors from light to dark brown. At present, to response the high demand, the people get cocoons from nature. This action could reduce result, and {{the scarcity of}} the insect. Beside that, rearing was done by placing the larvae on the trees (outdoor rearing). The outdoor rearing resulted in high mortality because of predators or stress. Better rearing is conducted by indoor rearing, that resulted in high survival rate, and high cocoon or egg production. It is because indoor rearing was supported in better environmental condition than outdoor condition that support physiological process eficiently...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} is presented of the fracture surfaces {{of three different}} silks produced by two silkworms (Attacus atlas (A. atlas) and Bombyx mori (B. mori)) and one spider (Argiope trifasciata (A. trifasciata)). Tensile tests up to fiber failure were performed at a strain rate of 0. 0002 s 1, and the fracture surfaces of the broken fibers were analyzed through a scanning electron microscope. The nominal relative humidity during the tests was 60 % and the average temperature was 20 C. A. <b>atlas</b> <b>silk</b> was formed of bunches of microfibrils of 1 lm in diameter embedded in a soft matrix, which were pulled out from the matrix during fracture. B. mori fibers were made up of two brins of irregular shape embedded in a proteinaceous coating. Failure occurred by fracture of the brins, whose fracture surface presented a fine globular structure corresponding {{to the ends of}} the nanofibrils of 1 – 2 lm in length and 100 nm in diameter, which form the B. mori silk brins according to the analysis of the brins by atomic force microscopy. A. trifasciata fibers were circular and exhibited a defined core-skin structure. The skin fracture surface was featureless while the core showed a globular structure similar to that of B. mori although slightly shallower. The fractographic observations were discussed in the light of current knowledge of the microstructure of each fiber and the corresponding mechanical properties. 200...|$|E
