5|$|Oil spills have {{devastating effects}} on the environment. Crude oil {{contains}} polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> clean up, and last for years in the sediment and marine environment. Marine species constantly exposed to PAHs can exhibit developmental problems, susceptibility to disease, and abnormal reproductive cycles.|$|E

The reopened Miyajima Aquarium in Hiroshima (Japan) houses three finless porpoises. In the Vancouver Aquarium (Canada), there is a harbour porpoise on display, Daisy, who beached herself into Horseshoe Bay in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Immature American {{white and}} scarlet ibises <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> tell apart, {{although}} scarlet ibises {{tend to have}} darker legs and bare skin around the face. An immature American white ibis could be mistaken for an immature glossy ibis, but the latter is wholly dark brown and lacks the white belly and rump. The adult is distinguishable from the wood stork, which is much larger and its wings have more black on them.|$|E

5|$|Although {{tickets for}} the Masters are not expensive, they <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> come by. Even the {{practice}} rounds {{can be difficult to}} get into. Applications for practice round tickets have to be made nearly a year in advance and the successful applicants are chosen by random ballot. Tickets to the actual tournament are sold only to members of a patrons list, which is closed. A waiting list for the patrons list was opened in 1972 and closed in 1978. It was reopened in 2000 and subsequently closed once again. In 2008, the Masters also began allowing children (between the ages of 8 and 16) to enter on tournament days free if they are accompanied by the patron who is the owner of his or her badge.|$|E
5|$|Proteins can {{associate}} to form protein complexes, these often contain {{a set of}} proteins with similar functions, such as enzymes that carry out several steps in the same metabolic pathway. This organization can allow substrate channeling, which is when the product of one enzyme is passed directly to the next enzyme in a pathway without being released into solution. Channeling can make a pathway more rapid and efficient {{than it would be}} if the enzymes were randomly distributed in the cytosol, and can also prevent the release of unstable reaction intermediates. Although a wide variety of metabolic pathways involve enzymes that are tightly bound to each other, others may involve more loosely associated complexes that <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> study outside the cell. Consequently, the importance of these complexes for metabolism in general remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|The {{territorial}} {{call of the}} Australian raven is a slow, high ah-ah-aaaah {{with the}} last note drawn out. It uses this call to communicate with other Australian ravens in the area. When giving this call, the species has a horizontal posture, holding its head forward and body parallel to the ground, while perched on a prominent position. It ruffles its hackles and lowers its tail, and sometimes holds its beak open between calls. In contrast, the little raven and forest raven hold their bodies in an upright posture. This call becomes louder if trespassers encroach upon the Australian raven's territory. The five Australian species <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> tell apart, with the call being {{the easiest way to}} do so, although the drawing-out of the final note—long held to be solely recorded for the Australian raven—has been recorded for the other species and is hence not diagnostic.|$|E

5|$|Volcanic ash clouds <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> detect from {{aircraft}} as no onboard cockpit instruments {{exist to}} detect them. However, {{a new system}} called Airborne Volcanic Object Infrared Detector (AVOID) has recently been developed by Nicarnica Aviation, a daughter company of the Norwegian Institute for Air Research, which will allow pilots to detect ash plumes up to 100 km (62 mi) ahead and fly safely around them. The system uses two fast-sampling infrared cameras, mounted on a forward-facing surface, that are tuned to detect volcanic ash. This system can detect ash concentrations of <1 mg/m3 to > 50 mg/m3, giving pilots approximately 7–10 minutes warning. The camera is currently being tested by easyJet airline company.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the summer {{roosting}} locations of this species, as well as where maternal colonies are formed, which makes a proper species distribution estimate difficult to obtain. The first study into the summer roosting habits was only done in 2011 so information is scarce. This study performed by Johnson, Kiser and Peterson discovered that these bats most commonly use ground level rock roosts in talus slopes, rock fields and vertical cliff faces for their summer roosts. On average they change their roosts every 1.1 days, males travel about 41 meters between consecutive roosts and females around 67 meters. They also found that females roosting sites were closer to ephemeral water sources than male’s roosts. Females who have young require roost sites that receive a lot of sunlight in order to keep the pups warm while the mother is away from the nesting site. Summer roosting habitats <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> find, and may be threatened by mining, quarrying, oil and gas drilling and other mineral extraction, as well as logging, sprawl highway construction, wind energy and other forms of agricultural, industrial and residential development. However, it is also likely that some of the above disturbances could also create roosting sites for the species.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to radar-guided missiles, IR-guided missiles <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> find {{as they approach}} aircraft. They do not emit detectable radar, and they are generally fired from a rear visual-aspect, directly toward the engines. In most cases, pilots {{have to rely on}} their wingmen to spot the missile's smoke trail and alert them. Since IR-guided missiles are inherently far shorter-legged in distance and altitude range than their radar-guided counterparts, good situational awareness of altitude and potential threats continues to be an effective defense. More advanced electro-optical systems can detect missile launches automatically from the distinct thermal emissions of a missile's rocket motor.|$|E

25|$|In principle, non-equilibrium {{statistical}} mechanics could be mathematically exact: ensembles for an isolated system evolve over time according to deterministic equations such as Liouville's equation or its quantum equivalent, the von Neumann equation. These equations {{are the result}} of applying the mechanical equations of motion independently to each state in the ensemble. Unfortunately, these ensemble evolution equations inherit much of the complexity of the underlying mechanical motion, and so exact solutions <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> obtain. Moreover, the ensemble evolution equations are fully reversible and do not destroy information (the ensemble's Gibbs entropy is preserved). In order to make headway in modelling irreversible processes, it is necessary to consider additional factors besides probability and reversible mechanics.|$|E
25|$|It {{is not yet}} known {{exactly how}} much wave energy is {{available}} to heat the corona. Results published in 2004 {{using data from the}} TRACE spacecraft seem to indicate that there are waves in the solar atmosphere at frequencies as high as 100 mHz (10 second period). Measurements of the temperature of different ions in the solar wind with the UVCS instrument aboard SOHO give strong indirect evidence that there are waves at frequencies as high as 200Hz, well into the range of human hearing. These waves <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> detect under normal circumstances, but evidence collected during solar eclipses by teams from Williams College suggest the presences of such waves in the 1–10Hz range.|$|E
25|$|In all, {{the short}} SOA (Stimuli Onset Asynchrony, i.e. the time delay between {{the onset of}} the mask and the prime) {{associated}} with the masking make the masked priming paradigm a good tool to investigate automatic and irrepressive activations during visual word recognition. Forster has argued that masked priming is a purer form of priming, as any conscious appreciation {{of the relationship between the}} prime and the target is effectively eliminated, and thus removes the subject's ability to use the prime strategically to make decisions. Results from numerous experiments show that certain forms of priming occur that <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> occur with visible primes. One such example is form-priming, where the prime is similar to, but not identical to the target (e.g., nature-mature).|$|E
