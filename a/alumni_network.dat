5|$|The Economist Intelligence Unit, the {{business}} information {{arm of the}} Economist Group, gathered results from two internet questionnaires, one of business schools and one of their students and recent graduates, and used them to rate business schools located all over the world. Information provided by the schools made up 80% of the ranking, with student and alumni responses accounting for only 20%. Factors in the evaluation included faculty:student ratio, GMAT scores of incoming students, student body diversity, foreign languages offered, percentage of graduates finding jobs within three months after graduation, percentage of graduates finding jobs through the school's career service, graduates' salaries and the comparison of pre-enrollment and post-graduation salaries, and student/alumni evaluations of the program, facilities, services, and <b>alumni</b> <b>network.</b> Results were tabulated using a smoothing method incorporating the three previous years' results. The organization used strict data provision thresholds, {{with the result that}} some highly regarded schools were omitted from the list of 100 ranked schools.|$|E

40|$|In {{times of}} {{increasing}} skills shortage, regions and particularly non-core regions, need to attract highly-skilled workers. It {{is better for}} these regions to (re) -attract highly-skilled workers that gained knowledge and contacts elsewhere and because they once lived in the region for study have already ties to the university region than trying to attract outsiders without such ties. In general, social networks can contribute to nurturing a “warm place ” perception among potential workers. This paper looks at special kinds of social networks. It focuses on higher education <b>alumni</b> <b>networks</b> and discusses their role in retention and (re) -attraction for increasing the highly skilled workforce in their university regions. Being part of a university community means that <b>alumni</b> <b>networks</b> are able to maintain continuous contact with their alumni and {{have a positive effect}} on students remaining in the region. This can occur through co-operation with the regional economy. However, the current study found that the analysed <b>alumni</b> <b>networks</b> were set up primarily as communication instruments for graduates and alumni and not for regional economy purposes. If elements of retention and (re) -attraction are found in the network activities, this is more an unintentional side effect than a purposeful attempt to contribute to the regional economy. This paper argues that <b>alumni</b> <b>networks</b> could take on such a retention and (re) -attraction function if they broadened their scope of activities and reorganized their management structure.

In particular, we analyze the networking behavior of entrepreneurs in Germany through the emergent structures of their virtual social networks. We automatically collected the publicly accessible portion of the German business networking site Xing. com by crawling the Web. We then filtered the people by attributes indicative of their university, and roles as founders, entrepreneurs, and CEOs. We constructed <b>alumni</b> <b>networks</b> of 12 German universities, identifying over 50, 000 alumni, out of which more than 15, 000 had entrepreneurship attributes. We also manually evaluated the financial success of a subsample of 80 entrepreneurs for each university. Universities, which are more central in the German university network provide a better environment for students to found more and more successful startups. People in <b>alumni</b> <b>networks</b> whose members have a stronger “old-boys-network”, i. e. a larger share of their links with other alumni of their alma mater than with outside people, are more successful as founders of startups. We repeated this analysis on the individual level, combining all 15, 000 founders, confirming the same result. Finally, the absolute amount of networking matters, i. e. the more links entrepreneurs have, and the higher their betweenness in the online <b>network</b> of university <b>alumni,</b> the more successful they are...|$|R
