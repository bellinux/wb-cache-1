500|$|The use of {{a safety}} car to start the race had a mixed {{response}} within the sport. Coulthard agreed with the FIA's decision: [...] "I know {{there will be a}} debate over it but the fact is I was asked beforehand <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> based on the previous years we've had here, the safest thing is to have a safety-car start". He added that although the safety-car start eliminated overtaking, it also prevented a major accident. Ralf Schumacher also agreed with the decision to start under safety-car conditions. However, ITV commentator and former driver Martin Brundle felt that the track was not wet enough for a safety car. Journalist Nigel Roebuck said that the length of time under safety-car conditions was inadequate, and raised the possibility of abandoning standing starts. FIA race director Charlie Whiting consulted Coulthard, the drivers' representative, before making his decision.|$|E
2500|$|Commons {{started the}} 2010–11 season playing {{as one of}} the three {{advanced}} midfielders behind the main striker in Derby's new 4–2–3–1 formation and managed his best run of games for almost 18 months when he started seven of Derby's opening eight games, appearing as substitute in the other, and scored two goals, including the winner in a 2–1 opening day victory at Leeds United. Despite this, Nigel Clough voiced his concerns over Commons' early season form, saying after a 1–1 draw with Barnsley; [...] "For the amount of good possession we got to Kris Commons on Saturday, we didn’t get anything from it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> to him after the game. We got the ball to him in decent areas, running at the back four, 10 yards outside the box, and we didn’t get a cross, shot or save from the goalkeeper. If he is going to play in there he must start producing something." [...] Commons responded with seven goals in his next nine games, including braces in a 3–1 win over Middlesbrough (in which he also missed a penalty), a 3–2 win at Doncaster Rovers and a 2–0 win at Ipswich Town to take his goal tally to nine from 15 league starts.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 June 2016, Farage made {{a speech}} in the European Parliament in which he claimed that a {{hypothetical}} failure for the EU to forge a trade deal with an exiting UK would [...] "be far worse for you {{than it would be}} for us", to heckling and laughing by Parliament members. He insulted his fellow MEPs, claiming that [...] "virtually none" [...] of them had ever had done [...] "a proper job" [...] in their lives. Media around the world covered Farage's speech, including his comment: [...] "... when I came here 17 years ago, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> I wanted to lead a campaign to get Britain to leave the European Union, you all laughed at me. Well I have to say, you're not laughing now are you?" [...] and his prediction that Britain will not be the only country to leave the EU. [...] In response, Guy Verhofstadt compared Farage's referendum posters with Nazi propaganda and credited the Brexit campaign with causing a multi-billion loss in the stock exchange. Explicitly addressing Farage, Verhofstadt added, [...] "... Ok. Let’s be positive. Finally, we're {{going to get rid of}} the biggest waste in the budget of the (European) Union, that we have paid for 17 years, your salary." ...|$|E

We evolved as a dance band with a fusion of R&B and rock, and we ended up as a {{psychedelic}} soul band once we added Linda. She was singing for us by the time we opened for Cream at Winterland. Her mother made her a floor-length ruffled red leather cape. It was very dramatic.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I gave {{my brother}} into your hands, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> if {{he died a}} brave man's death, I could ask for no more. You told me that such a death was his.' ...|$|E

60|$|She put {{her arms}} around my neck, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> it would do admirably; but I had a certain sinking of the heart, for I saw how hard it was even for Eveleth to part with her property.|$|E
6000|$|... "What did I tell you, sir," [...] she said, after a pause, [...] "when I {{said goodbye}} to you at Coimbra? That I would rather be your cousin. You were quite hurt, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> you were a silly boy, and would {{understand}} better, some day." ...|$|E

5000|$|Despite his largesse, Gaines had a penny-pinching side. He would {{frequently}} stop {{meetings to}} find out who had called a particular long-distance phone number. Longtime Mad editor Nick Meglin called Gaines a [...] "living contradiction" [...] in 2011, saying, [...] "He was singularly the cheapest man in the world, and the most generous." [...] Meglin described his experience of asking Gaines for a raise of $3 a week; after rejecting the request, the publisher then treated Meglin to an expensive dinner at one of New Yorks best restaurants. Recalled Meglin: [...] "The check came, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>Thats</b> the whole raise! [...] "And Bill <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> like good conversation <b>and</b> good food. <b>I</b> dont enjoy giving raises." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How dare you?" [...] she gasped. [...] "I’ve {{never said}} such {{things in my}} life.

6000|$|... "Yes, Mrs. Thompson: {{some four}} years ago I was at Ramsgate, and when there I struck up a great {{acquaintance}} with your mother.

6000|$|SHE {{thought it}} would shame me!

5000|$|According to Thomas, Wilson circa 2008 or 2010 inquired to {{him about}} demo tapes {{recorded}} during the sessions for Imagination: [...] "He called up and said I've got some ideas for some new Beach Boys songs, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>That’s</b> great, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> pointed out to him that when we worked together several years ago he had the genesis of some other Beach Boy songs {{that he had never}} really wanted to put on any of his solo records."

6000|$|... "It {{has been}} a {{wonderful}} comfort to me," [...] Lady Greendale said, [...] "that I have met hardly anyone that I know. The last three weeks or so I have met two or three people, but I only said that I was up in town for a short time.

6000|$|Beside the fire, {{my master}} fell to devising {{about the state}} of the country, as burgesses love to do. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> if I were the Dauphin, Chinon Castle should not hold me long, for my [...] "spur would be in my horse's side, and the bridle on his mane," [...] {9} as the old song of the Battle of Harlaw runs, and I on the way to Orleans.

5000|$|According {{to record}} {{producer}} Joe Thomas, Brian Wilson circa 2008 or 2010 inquired {{to him about}} demo tapes recorded during the sessions for Wilson's 1998 solo album Imagination which Thomas co-produced: [...] "He called up and said I've got some ideas for some new Beach Boys songs, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>That’s</b> great, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> pointed out to him that when we worked together several years ago he had the genesis of some other Beach Boy songs {{that he had never}} really wanted to put on any of his solo records.

60|$|As {{they were}} to remain with us that day and had taken their places to return by the coach next morning, I sought an {{opportunity}} of speaking to Mr. Skimpole. Our out-of-door life easily threw one in my way, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> delicately <b>said</b> <b>that</b> there was a responsibility in encouraging Richard.|$|R
60|$|I {{then said}} we would start immediately. I believe I said it calmly, though I was {{conscious}} of a shudder and of a paling cheek, {{in view of the}} nature of the exploit I was so unreflectingly engaged in. But the old daredevil spirit was upon me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> as I had committed myself I would not back down; I would ascend Mont Blanc if it cost me my life. I told the man to slant his machine in the proper direction and let us be off.|$|E
60|$|I {{was anxious}} not to outstay his strength, and I kept {{my eye on}} the clock in {{frequent}} glances. I saw that he followed me in one of these, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> I knew what his hours were, and I was watching so that I might go away in time, and then he sweetly protested. Did I like that chair I was sitting in? It was a gift to him, and he said who gave it, with a pleasure {{in the fact that}} was very charming, as if he liked the association of the thing with his friend. He was disposed to excuse the formal look of his bookcases, which were filled with sets, and presented some phalanxes of fiction in rather severe array.|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, girls, we must talk business. In {{the first}} place, I {{have had a}} long chat this morning with Mr. Fairlow, our lawyer. He tells me that, as I had expected, there is not very much besides the life-insurance. The {{practice}} has hardly done more than paid for the carriage and horses {{for the last three}} years. Mr. Petersfield and I are executors. The will was made nearly four years ago, just after you girls missed finding the will in the secret room at Harmer Place. Papa asked me at the time if I agreed to its provisions, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> of course I did, for it was just as I should have wished it to be. The amount of insurance, £4,000, is divided among you girls; I am left everything else." ...|$|E
