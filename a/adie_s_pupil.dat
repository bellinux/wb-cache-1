40|$|Purpose of {{the study}} Previous {{teaching}} experience {{is one of the}} most discussed issues in today 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>pupil</b> personnel services. We find ourselves in the milieu of a controversy in which we have advocates of one camp who propose that teaching experience can be a handicap in the effectiveness of a counselor; and in the other camp, that teaching experience is a vital prerequisite for counselor effectiveness. The controversy has reached such proportions that some states, which previously held teaching experience as a necessary requirement for counselor certification, have either changed certification requirements or have worked around the issue by accepting practice teaching, intern teaching, or substitute teaching as evidence that the requirement has been satisfied. Method of procedure The methods employed in this study were threefold: (1) a very thorough review of the current literature, (2) study of counselor certification requirements in the Southwest; namely, Arizona, California, New Mexico, Nevada, Texas, and Utah, and (3) an independent survey of school administrators employed in major cities within each of the above mentioned states.

40|$|Performance studies {{relying on}} sound {{recordings}} as evidence have often focused on establishing trends and traditions in various periods and repertoire. So far {{little attention has}} been paid to individual artistic profiles and idiosyncratic expression. Yet if performance is as significant as the notated work, as has often been argued, musicologists must be able to show what identifies a particularly famous interpreter just as they can state what characterizes the works of a prominent composer. This paper investigates the individual differences between two famous violinists. The solo Bach recordings of Nathan Milstein and Jascha Heifetz - two of Leopold Auer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>pupils</b> - are analyzed for technical and interpretative features using aural and software assisted methods. The study of phrasing, bowing, fingering, use of vibrato and portamento, tempo choices, and approaches to rhythm and repeats indicates clear differences in both technique and artistic disposition. Heifetz has been found to vary repeats, including changes to fingering that result in more frequent portamenti; to use a faster and wider vibrato, and generally to allow for a more subjective interpretation. Milstein 2 ̆ 7 s vibrato was found to be narrow and even, his approach consisting of preference for low positions and open strings; a relatively steady treatment of tempo, and an overall tendency to provide a more literalistic reading of the score. A comparison with the Bach recordings of contemporaneous violinists (Enescu, Szigeti, Menuhin) highlighted the problematic nature of discussing trends in relation to performance practice. It appears that when a particular era is examined in detail individual differences may outweigh the significance of possible period trends. Results provide a step towards distinguishing broad categories of performing 2 ̆ 2 traditions 2 ̆ 2 from individual 2 ̆ 2 signatures 2 ̆ 2, as well as some quantifiable data in support of the artistic status of these violinists...|$|R
40|$|Large {{works on}} paper, in {{particular}} ones that covered walls, were {{new in the}} realm of printed works of art during {{the early decades of the}} sixteenth century. Following in the footsteps of wall hangings and tapestries of the late medieval period, wallpaper became a new concept in the Renaissance. Although wallpaper has generally fallen in and out of favor in the past several decades, it recently has been experiencing its own renaissance with visual artists. At the Rhode Island School of Design, a 2003 exhibition entitled On the Wall: Wallpaper by Contemporary Artists featured wallpaper with a variety of patterns and designs, from fisheyes to photo-realist landscapes. Over the centuries wallpaper 2 ̆ 7 s popularity has also waxed and waned. In the final years of Albrecht Dürer’s life, thirty years after his Apocalypse series of 1498 changed how woodcuts were perceived in terms of size and importance, Dürer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>pupil</b> Sebald Beham rethought what a woodcut print might be and what it could show. This included its use as wallpaper. Where Dürer broke new ground in the exploration ofthe larger, full-page size for visual image alone and the role of the woodcut designer as publisher, Beham explored subject matter new for the woodcut technique and for large-sized woodcuts; subject matter that had sometimes been executed in engraving before, but never in woodcut in large format, and thereby expanded the audience for large independent woodcuts, including wallpaper prints. I will explore in this essay the use of such woodcuts, and their audiences and sizes. Later I will focus on one of Beham’s large woodcuts that was used as wallpaper, showing that the taste for such domestic decoration links the half millenium between the Northern Renaissance and the recent wallpaper revival...|$|R

The background literature has focused on Piaget 2 ̆ 7 s and Vygotsky 2 ̆ 7 s theories of cognitive development as they relate to the intervention programme and the age group of the participants in this research study. The review discusses the need to teach thinking and the relevant literature on the intervention programme is critically reviewed. This research study, undertaken in and adapted for an Irish primary school, involved a sample of forty four participants aged between four and six years old. An intervention group of twenty pupils participated in the learning intervention Lets Think!-Early Years programme – based on the theory of cognitive acceleration. The learning intervention programme consisted of fifteen lessons based on the early science skills of classification, seriation and causality. The remainder of the group were the non-intervention group. All participants underwent three pre and post intervention tests and completed a pupil questionnaire. Local teachers completed a teacher questionnaire on questions relating to the research question and this combined with the researcher 2 ̆ 7 s observations recorded in a reflective journal provided the data to be analysed. A comparative analysis of responses obtained from the above tests, questionnaires and reflective journal, suggest that pupils from the intervention group displayed a greater improvement in their thinking ability in comparison to the nonintervention group, with the factors of gender and age of the pupils having a significant effect.

40|$|Alignment of two-element telescopes is {{a classic}} problem. During recent {{integration}} and test of the Space Interferometry Mission s (SIM s) Astrometric Beam Combiner (ABC), the innovators were faced with aligning two such telescope subsystems {{in the presence of}} a further complication: only two small subapertures in each telescope <b>s</b> <b>pupil</b> were accessible for measuring the wavefront with a Fizeau interferometer. This meant that the familiar aberrations that might be interpreted to infer system misalignments could be viewed only over small sub-regions of the pupil, making them hard to recognize. Further, there was no contiguous surface of the pupil connecting these two subapertures, so relative phase piston information was lost; the underlying full-aperture aberrations therefore had an additional degree of ambiguity. The solution presented here is to recognize that, in the absence of phase piston, the Zygo measurements primarily provide phase tilt in the subaperture windows of interest. Because these windows are small and situated far from the center of the (inaccessible) unobscured full aperture, any aberrations that are higher-order than tilt will be extremely high-order on the full aperture, and so not necessary or helpful to the alignment. Knowledge of the telescope s optical prescription allows straightforward evaluation of sensitivities (subap mode strength per unit full-aperture aberration), and these can be used in a predictive matrix approach to move with assurance to an aligned state. The technique is novel in every operational way compared to the standard approach of alignment based on full-aperture aberrations or searching for best rms wavefront. This approach is closely grounded in the observable quantities most appropriate to the problem. It is also more intuitive than inverting full phase maps (or subaperture Zernike spectra) with a ray-tracing program, which must certainly work in principle, but in practice met with limited success. Even if such classical alignment techniques became practical, the techniques reported here form a reassuringly transparent and intuitive check on the course of the alignment with very little computational effort...|$|R

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{concern that the}} United States is not {{preparing}} {{a sufficient number of}} students, teachers, and practitioners in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). A large majority of secondary school students fail to reach proficiency in math and science, and many are taught by teachers lacking adequate subject matter knowledge. When compared to other nations, the math and science achievement of U. <b>S.</b> <b>pupils</b> and the rate of STEM degree attainment appear inconsistent with a nation considered the world leader in scientific innovation. In a recent international assessment of 15 -year-old students, the U. S. ranked 28 th in math literacy and 24 th in science literacy. Moreover, the U. S. ranks 20 th among all nations in the proportion of 24 -year-olds who earn degrees in natural science or engineering. A 2005 study by the Government Accountability Office found that 207 distinct federal STEM education programs were appropriated nearly $ 3 billion in FY 2004. Nearly three-quarters of those funds and nearly half of the STEM programs were in two agencies: the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. Still, the study concluded that these programs are highly decentralized and require better coordination. Though uncovering many fewer individual programs, a 2007 inventory compiled by the American Competitiveness Council also put the federal STEM effort at $ 3 billion and concurred with many of the GAO findings regarding decentralization and coordination. STEM education (and competitiveness) issues have received a lot of attention in recent years. Several high-profile proposals were forwarded by the academic and business communities. In February of 2006, the President released the American Competitiveness Initiative. During the 109 th Congress, three somewhat modest STEM education programs were passed and signed into law.

When talking about their own contributions in the foreign language, all pupils mentioned the embarrassment of speaking out in front of their peers as an issue inhibiting their participation. However, they also indicated which activities made them feel more secure and disposed to speak. The study was exploratory and on a very small scale but suggests the need for more research into the strategies ML teachers use to overcome learners’ inhibitions and that successfully promote development of pupils’ oral skills...|$|R
40|$|Video-based eye {{tracking}} techniques {{have become increasingly}} attractive in many research fields, such as visual perception and human-computer interface design. The technique primarily relies on the positional difference between {{the center of the}} eye 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>pupil</b> and the first-surface reflection at the cornea, the corneal reflection (CR). This difference vector is mapped to determine an observer 2 ̆ 7 s point of regard (POR). In current head-mounted video-based eye trackers, the systems are limited in several aspects, such as inadequate measurement range and misdetection of eye features (pupil and CR). This research first proposes a new `structured illumination 2 ̆ 7 configuration, using multiple IREDs to illuminate the eye, to ensure that eye positions can still be tracked even during extreme eye movements (up to ± 45 ° horizontally and ± 25 ° vertically). Then eye features are detected by a two-stage processing approach. First, potential CRs and the pupil are isolated based on statistical information in an eye image. Second, genuine CRs are distinguished by a novel CR location prediction technique based on the well-correlated relationship between the offset of the pupil and that of the CR. The optical relationship of the pupil and CR offsets derived in this thesis can be applied to two typical illumination configurations - collimated and near-source ones- in the video-based {{eye tracking}} system. The relationships from the optical derivation and that from an experimental measurement match well. Two application studies, smooth pursuit dynamics in controlled static (laboratory) and unconstrained vibrating (car) environments were conducted. In the first study, the extended stimuli (color photographs subtending 2 ° and 17 °, respectively) were found to enhance smooth pursuit movements induced by realistic images, and the eye velocity for tracking a small dot (subtending 3 ̆c 0. 1 °) was saturated at about 64 deg/sec while the saturation velocity occurred at higher velocities for the extended images. The difference in gain due to target size was significant between dot and the two extended stimuli, while no statistical difference existed between the two extended stimuli. In the second study, twovisual stimuli same as in the first study were used. The visual performance was impaired dramatically due to the whole body motion in the car, even in the tracking of a slowly moving target (2 deg/sec); the eye was found not able to perform a pursuit task as smooth as in the static environment though the unconstrained head motion in the unstable condition was supposed to enhance the visual performance...|$|R
