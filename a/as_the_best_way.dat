5|$|Amanda Ripley's {{introduction}} in Aliens was {{not included}} in the theatrical version of the film, since 20th Century Fox was concerned about the film's running time. Sigourney Weaver criticized the cut, seeing Amanda as crucial to Ellen Ripley's character development and her bond with the orphaned Newt. While developing Alien: Isolation, Creative Assembly originally desired a female protagonist and decided to use Amanda <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to focus on her mother, Ellen's, traits. The picture model for Ripley in Aliens is Elizabeth Inglis, Sigourney Weaver's mother, and in Alien: Isolation she is voiced by Andrea Deck with motion capture by Kezia Burrows. Amanda's design in Alien: Isolation was based on pictures from Elizabeth Inglis' youth.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{consisting}} of twenty chapters– one {{was cut in}} later editions– Theory of Literature describes various aspects of literary theory, criticism, and history. After defining various aspects and relationships of literature in general, Wellek and Warren divide analysis of literature based on two approaches: extrinsic, relating to factors outside a work such as the author and society, and intrinsic, relating to factors within such as rhythm and meter. They stress the {{need to focus on}} the intrinsic elements of a work <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to truly understand it. In doing so they adapt the phenomenology used by Roman Ingarden.|$|E

5|$|Blaine saw {{presiding}} over the cabinet {{as a chance to}} preside over the Washington social scene, as well, and soon ordered construction of a new, larger home near Dupont Circle. Although his foreign policy experience was minimal, Blaine quickly threw himself into his new duties. By 1881, Blaine had completely abandoned his protectionist leanings and now used his position as Secretary of State to promote freer trade, especially within the western hemisphere. His reasons were twofold: firstly, Blaine’s old fear of British interference in the Americas was undiminished, and he saw increased trade with Latin America <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to keep Britain from dominating the region. Secondly, he believed that by encouraging exports, he could increase American prosperity, and by doing so position the Republican party as the author of that prosperity, ensuring continued electoral success. Garfield agreed with his Secretary of State’s vision and Blaine called for a Pan-American conference in 1882 to mediate disputes among the Latin American nations and to serve as a forum for talks on increasing trade. At the same time, Blaine hoped to negotiate a peace in the War of the Pacific then being fought by Bolivia, Chile, and Peru. Blaine favored a resolution that would not result in Peru yielding any territory, but Chile, which had by 1881 occupied the Peruvian capital, rejected any negotiations that would gain them nothing. Blaine sought to expand American influence in other areas, calling for renegotiation of the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty to allow the United States to construct a canal through Panama without British involvement, as well as attempting to reduce British involvement in the strategically located Kingdom of Hawaii. His plans for the United States' involvement in the world stretched even beyond the Western Hemisphere, as he sought commercial treaties with Korea and Madagascar.|$|E

25|$|In {{reaction}} to events in Quebec and formal {{demands of the}} Lesage government, Lester Pearson's ruling Liberal government in Ottawa sought to address the new political assertiveness of Quebec. He commissioned the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism in 1963. Pearson also recruited Pierre Trudeau, who campaigned against the violation of civil liberties under Duplessis and {{the economic and political}} marginalization of French Quebecers in the 1950s.

25|$|The {{republic}} regained {{its independence}} as the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek ("South African Republic"), or ZAR. Paul Kruger, {{one of the}} leaders of the uprising, became President of the ZAR in 1883. Meanwhile, the British, who viewed their defeat at Majuba as an aberration, forged ahead with their desire to federate the Southern African colonies and republics. They saw this <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to come to terms with the fact of a white Afrikaner majority, as well as to promote their larger strategic interests in the area.|$|E
25|$|A Secular Humanist Declaration {{was issued}} in 1980 by the Council for Secular Humanism's predecessor, CODESH. It lays out ten ideals: Free inquiry {{as opposed to}} {{censorship}} and imposition of belief; {{separation of church and}} state; the ideal of freedom from religious control and from jingoistic government control; ethics based on critical intelligence rather than that deduced from religious belief; moral education; religious skepticism; reason; a belief in science and technology <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> of understanding the world; evolution; and education as the essential method of building humane, free, and democratic societies.|$|E

Home Rule had been lost in 1913, an inflexible IPP long {{out of touch with}} reality, reflected by Britain's two failed attempts to introduce Home Rule in 1916 and again in 1917. O'Brien refused to participate in the Irish Convention after southern unionist representatives he had proposed were turned down. The Convention ended as he predicted in failure when Britain attempted to link the enactment of Home Rule with conscription.|$|E

Josef Brems: 1870-1958), and Norway (Mgr. Jan O. Smit: 1883-1972) discussed themes of common interest such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> {{of dealing with the}} congregations of women religious, how to foster the spiritual life of their priests, but above all how to prepare for the announced Scandinavian tour of the Cardinal Prefect of the Roman Congregation Propaganda Fide, Willem Marinus van Rossum, the first such dignitary to enter Scandinavia since the Reformation.|$|E
25|$|AWPD-42 {{was written}} under the {{assumption}} that the Soviet Union would be knocked out of the war, and that German forces in the East would then be brought to bear against the West. The plan thus assumed that German ground forces defending Europe would be numerically superior to Allied invasion forces, making invasion extremely costly and perhaps impossible. As well, two-front tension in the German economy would lessen, and Allied damage to Axis industry would be more easily absorbed. An increase in American air power was projected <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to reduce Axis industrial might. An air campaign against two major European objectives was encompassed: first to paralyze Axis industrial power, and second to defeat Axis air power. Axis aircraft factories and aircraft engine plants were to be targeted during 1943–1944 so that, in the Spring of 1944, an invasion of Europe could be undertaken.|$|E
25|$|Germany's {{policy was}} {{to support a}} swift war to destroy Serbia that would present a fait accompli to the world. Unlike the three earlier cases dating from 1912 when Austria had asked for German {{diplomatic}} support for a war against Serbia, {{this time it was}} felt that political conditions for such a war now existed. At this time, the German military supported the idea of an Austrian attack against Serbia <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> of starting a general war, whereas Wilhelm believed that an Austro-Serbian war would be purely local. Austrian policy based upon pre-existing plans to destroy Serbia involved not waiting to complete judicial inquiries to strike back immediately and not to strain its credibility in the coming weeks as it would become more and more clear that Austria was not reacting to the assassination. Likewise, Germany wished to give the impression of its ignorance of Austrian intentions.|$|E

40|$|From the Introduction]. In the 1990 ’s, the CFSP and its {{military}} component the ESDP have become core {{elements of the}} French defense doctrine. Whereas the Gaullist doctrine in the 1960 ’s put the emphasis on sovereignty and independence <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ways</b> to maintain <b>the</b> French position in international politics, the European political unification being a complementary option, the new strategy is much {{more aware of the}} necessity to act within a European framework. In 1994, the building of a European defense policy is quoted in the Livre blanc on defense <b>as</b> one of <b>the</b> French priorities, which is quite a new idea. Two decades earlier, the 1972 Livre blanc on national defense did not even mention the possibility of creating a European defense...|$|R
25|$|After the {{election}} of Obama for president, Republicans in Congress were unified in almost total opposition to the programs and policies of Obama and the Democratic majority. They unsuccessfully attempted to stop an $814 billion stimulus spending program, new regulations on investment firms, and a program to require health insurance for all Americans. They did keep emissions trading from coming to a vote, and vow {{to continue to work}} to convince Americans that burning fossil fuel does not cause global warming. The slow growth of the economy {{in the first two years}} of the Obama administration led Republicans to call for a return to tax cuts and deregulation of businesses, which they perceived <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to solve the financial crisis. Obama's approval rating steadily declined in his first year in office before leveling off at about 50-50. This decline in popularity led to a GOP landslide in the mid-term elections of 2010.|$|E
25|$|By 1976, Stevie Wonder {{had become}} one of the most popular figures in R and pop music, not only in the U.S., but worldwide. Within a short space of time, the albums Talking Book, Innervisions and Fulfillingness' First Finale were all {{back-to-back}} top five successes, with the latter two winning Grammy Award for Album of the Year, in 1974 and 1975, respectively. By the end of 1975, Wonder became serious about quitting the music industry and emigrating to Ghana to work with handicapped children. He had expressed his anger with the way that the U.S. government was running the country. A farewell concert was being considered <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to bring down the curtain on his career. Wonder changed his decision, when he signed a new contract with Motown on August 5, 1975, thinking he was better off making the most of his career. At the time, rivals such as Arista and Epic were also interested in him. The contract was laid out as a seven-year, seven LP, $37 million deal and gave him full artistic control, making this the largest deal made with a recording star up to that point. Almost at the beginning Wonder took a year off from the music market, with a project for a double album to be released in 1976.|$|E
