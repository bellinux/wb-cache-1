Three to five months later, the same survey was re-administered to 437 of the initial participants who agreed to take part a second time. Hypotheses predicted that higher levels of anxious and avoidant <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> God would be associated with poorer levels of mental health, that the results would remain significant after controlling for <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> others and initial mental health, and that higher levels of stress would moderate the relationship between <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> God and mental health variables. Findings provided support for a strong association between <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> God and mental health, and a less strong association between avoidant <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> God and mental health. <b>Attachment</b> <b>to</b> God showed stability over time, and stress only moderated the relationship between anxious <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> God and well-being.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this quantitative, {{correlational}} {{study was to examine}} whether Christian, Millennial college students’ secure <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> God relationship could contribute to their psychological separation. This question was addressed by examining (a) the correlation between <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> parents and psychological separation, (b) the correlation between <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> parents and <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> God, and (b) the correlation between <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> God and psychological separation. Bowlby’s (1969, 1973, 1982) attachment theory was used as the theoretical foundation to explore both the students’ relationships with parents and God. <b>Attachment</b> <b>to</b> parents of Christian, Millennial college students attending a Southern Christian college was measured by the revised Inventory of Parental and Peer Attachment (IPPA-R, Armsden 2 ̆ 6 Greenberg, 1987, 2017); <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> God by the <b>Attachment</b> <b>to</b> God Inventory (AGI, Beck 2 ̆ 6 McDonald, 2004); and psychological separation by the Psychological Separation Inventory (PSI, Hoffman, 1984). Analysis revealed this sample of Christian, Millennial college students as moderately secure in their <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> parents but psychologically still dependent and insecure in their <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> God.

5|$|Attachment {{disorder}} {{is a broad}} term intended to describe disorders of mood, behavior, and social relationships arising from a failure to form normal <b>attachments</b> <b>to</b> primary care giving figures in early childhood. Such a failure would result from unusual early experiences of neglect, abuse, abrupt separation from caregivers between 6 months and three years of age, frequent change or excessive numbers of caregivers, or lack of caregiver responsiveness to child communicative efforts resulting in a lack of basic trust. A problematic history of social relationships occurring after about age three may be distressing to a child, but does not result in attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|The Upanishad {{asserts that}} anyone can renounce – this choice is entirely up to the individual, {{regardless}} of which Ashrama (stage of life) he is in. The Jabala Upanishad seems to justify suicide as an individual choice in certain circumstances, a view opposed by earlier Vedic texts and Principal Upanishads. Those too sick may renounce the worldly life in their mind. The Jabala Upanishad presents the Vedanta philosophy view that one who truly renounces lives an ethical life, which includes not injuring anyone in thought, word or deed. Such a sannyasi (renunciate) abandons all rituals, is without <b>attachments</b> <b>to</b> anything or anyone, and is one who {{is devoted to the}} oneness of Atman and Brahman.|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{disorders}} tend {{to occur}} in a definable set of contexts such as within some types of institutions, {{in the presence of}} repeated changes of primary caregiver or of extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, but not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder. Studies undertaken on children from Eastern European orphanages from the mid-1990s showed significantly higher levels of both forms of RAD and of insecure patterns of attachment in the institutionalized children, regardless of how long they had been there. It would appear that children in institutions like these are unable to form selective <b>attachments</b> <b>to</b> their caregivers. The difference between the institutionalized children and the control group had lessened in the follow-up study three years later, although the institutionalized children continued to show significantly higher levels of indiscriminate friendliness. However, even among children raised in the most deprived institutional conditions the majority did not show symptoms of this disorder.|$|E

Contrary to prior theory, secure <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> God is not inversely associated with recent alcohol or marijuana use, or substance use prior to last sexual intercourse.

40|$|Using a novel {{approach}} <b>to</b> assess <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> therapist from patient narratives (Patient <b>Attachment</b> <b>to</b> Therapist Rating Scale; PAT-RS), {{we investigated}} the relationships between secure <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> therapist, patient-rated alliance, and outcome {{in a sample of}} 70 young adults treated with psychoanalytic psychotherapy. A series of linear mixed-effects models, controlling for length of therapy and therapist effects, indicated that secure <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> therapist at termination was associated with improvement in symptoms, global functioning, and interpersonal problems. After controlling for the alliance, these relationships were maintained in terms of symptoms and global functioning. Further, for the follow-up period, we found a suppression effect indicating that secure <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> therapist predicted continued improvement in global functioning, whereas the alliance predicted deterioration when both variables were modeled together. Although limited by the correlational design, this study suggests that the development of a secure <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> therapist is associated with treatment gains as well as predictive of posttreatment improvement in functioning. Future research should investigate the temporal development of <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> therapist and its interaction with alliance and outcome more closely. To ensure differentiation from patient-rated alliance, observer-based measurement of <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> therapist should be considered...|$|R
40|$|Relations between current {{paternal}} drinking status, <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> parents, {{and psychosocial}} functioning were examined {{to determine whether}} previously reported findings on children of alcoholics were replicated, and <b>to</b> evaluate perceived <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> parents as a mediator and/or moderator of adult children's adjustment. One hundred thirty-eight college students under age 23, 66 % female, 80 % White, 49 % with alcoholic fathers and all with non-problem-drinking mothers, completed self-report measures of parental drinking status, security of <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> parents, anxiety, depression, self-esteem, adult attachment style, alcohol involvement, and drug use. Most subjects scored in normal ranges for anxiety and depression, were moderate drinkers, and reported little drug use. Subjects with alcoholic fathers reported lower self-esteem and less-secure <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> father; they also more frequently reported that their father's parenting style was inconsistent, and less frequently reported that it was responsive. With psychosocial functioning variables hierarchically regressed on demographics, paternal drinking status, <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> father, and <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> mother, paternal alcoholism added to prediction of only self-esteem, <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> father improved prediction of secure adult attachment style rating, and <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> mother added to prediction of mental health, self-esteem, adult attachment, and alcohol use. In separate tests of statistical mediation, {{results are consistent with}} the role of <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> father as a mediator of the relation between paternal alcoholism and both mental health and security of adult attachment style, and with <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> mother as a mediator of the relation between paternal alcoholism and mental health, self-esteem, and adult attachment. Neither security of <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> father nor to mother was a linear moderator of statistical relations between paternal alcoholism and psychosocial adjustment; thus results did not support a buffering hypothesis. Findings warrant caution against assumption of psychopathology in alcoholics' children; most function within normal ranges on multiple measures. Knowledge of paternal alcoholism is, alone, a poor predictor of psychosocial adjustment; knowledge of the child's perception of parent-child relationships, particularly <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> mother, appears to have relatively greater predictive utility. Future research should include replication with a population not limited to college students...|$|R
5|$|Dispatch {{is notable}} {{for its use}} of, and the sole {{surviving}} remains of, Fell's Patent Knees. These were a patent innovation from 1839 by Jonathan Fell of Workington, Cumberland, and {{were part of the}} development of the iron and wood composite hull. Ships before this had been built from oak, where the strong curved brackets needed to join the deck into the hull side frames could be found as naturally grown 'knees' from the angles between major branches and the trunk. In the post-Nelsonic era there was a general shortage of shipbuilding timber, particularly oak, one of the few species with strong enough branch <b>attachments</b> <b>to</b> provide knees. Dispatch's hull is of pine, which has weak branches. A number of iron substitutes were developed, Fell's design being one of the later and more advanced forms. It had two advantages over earlier rigid-forged patterns: it provided a degree of flexibility in storms and, most significantly, could be stressed after the hull had been constructed and launched or even loaded, when the hull was under its working load. Together with the diagonal iron strapping, this rendered Dispatch's hull particularly strong and had allowed her to endure at least two collisions.|$|E
5|$|Unusual social {{development}} becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show {{less attention to}} social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms; for example, they have less eye contact and turn-taking, {{and do not have}} the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things. Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form <b>attachments</b> <b>to</b> their primary caregivers. Most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD. Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.|$|E

The purpose {{of this research was}} to investigate the relationship between the styles of <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> God and forgiveness and empathy among female students in the city of Qom. 250 students were selected from the city of Qom by cluster sampling. Three questionnaires were used: styles of <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> God by Kirkpatrick and Rowatt, emotional empathy by Mehrabian and Epstein and forgiveness inventory by Enzeit. Pearson correlation and Regression analysis were used for data analysis. The style of secure <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> God had a significantly positive relationship with forgiveness and empathy. Furthermore, the style of avoidant <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> God and the style of bilateral <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> God had a significantly negative relationship with forgiveness. In addition, the standard coefficients of all three predictive variables (Secure attachment, bilateral and avoidant to God) were all significant at p= 0. 05. Assessment and recognition of the style of <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> God, the students and its relation with forgiveness and empathy can have valuable implications in providing the mental health of the students. Conclusion: The findings of this research show a connection between the style of <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> God and forgiveness and empathy, indicate the clarification of <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> God in students' forgiveness and empathy. Based on the findings, it can be suggested that the theory of <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> God can be used in psychotherapy...|$|R

In order to prevent Batman from killing his adversary, Oracle initiates the Clock Tower's self-destruct sequence, provoking Batman to rescue her rather than continue the battle. This results in the destruction of Gordon's home and headquarters in the clock tower. Subsequently, Oracle decides to move on, and leaves Gotham City altogether. She cuts her ties with Batman, and after a temporary world trip with her team, relocates to Metropolis. In the events comprising Gail Simone's Birds of Prey: Between Dark and Dawn (2005), and Birds of Prey: The Battle Within (2005), Oracle is possessed by arch-villain Brainiac, an artificial intelligence entity, in order to become a biological being. Although Oracle overpowers Brainiac and expels him from her body, the advanced virus delivered by him remains despite his absence. The virus steadily causes cybernetic <b>attachments</b> <b>to</b> sprout all over her body. Oracle develops supernatural abilities that allow her to psychically interact with computer information systems. Although she loses these abilities after the virus is rendered dormant following an operation by Doctor Mid-Nite, she discovers she can move her toes. However, this proves to be short-lived; Gordon remains paralyzed.|$|E

The VLA- 5 integrin was shown to be the predominant receptor for fetal melanocyte <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> FN, in contrast with neonatal melanocytes in which the very late antigen (VLA) - 5, VLA- 3, and αv integrins each contributed <b>to</b> melanocyte <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> FN. Peptides containing the arginyl-glycyl-aspartyl-serine (RGDS) sequence inhibited fetal and neonatal melanocyte <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> FN by a maximum of 48 % and 85 %, respectively. The almost complete inhibition of neonatal melanocyte <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> FN by RGDS-containing peptides suggests that the central cell-binding domain of FN is the primary recognition site for neonatal cell <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> FN.

A comparison is made between Dutch and Indian early-adolescents and between boys and girls. Method A total of 384 Dutch and 186 Indian young-adolescents, aged 9 - 13 years, participated in this study. The data was gathered in 2008, in ten Dutch primary schools en two Indian medium schools. The participants completed two questionnaires, concerning <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> their parents and their problem behavior. Results Results show that a higher degree of <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> father and mother is correlated to less problem behavior. A hierarchical regression analysis with interaction effect has shown that the effect of <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> father on both internalising and externalising problem behavior is stronger for girls than for boys. Furthermore, it is shown that the effect of <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> father on problem behavior is stronger for Indian early-adolescents and that the effect of <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> mother on externalizing behavior is stronger for Dutch young-adolescents.
