5000|$|Small <b>Axe</b> <b>covers</b> {{have been}} {{designed}} by graphic artist Juliet Ali since 2006. The covers have been noted for their striking aesthetic. Some covers have aroused controversy. Small Axe 6 (1999) was considered controversial for its parodying of Edna Manley’s sculpture “Negro Aroused” (1937). In March 2000, Small Axe 7, guest-edited by Faith Smith, {{was rejected by the}} press for being pornographic. This controversy eventually led to the journal’s departure from University of the West Indies Press.|$|R
2500|$|A [...] "text revision" [...] of the DSM-IV, {{known as}} the DSM-IV-TR, was {{published}} in 2000. The diagnostic categories {{and the vast majority}} of the specific criteria for diagnosis were unchanged. The text sections giving extra information on each diagnosis were updated, as were some of the diagnostic codes to maintain consistency with the ICD. The DSM-IV-TR was organized into a five-part axial system. The first axis incorporated clinical disorders. The second axis covered personality disorders and intellectual disabilities. The remaining <b>axes</b> <b>covered</b> medical, psychosocial, environmental, and childhood factors functionally necessary to provide diagnostic criteria for health care assessments.|$|R

40|$|A {{new plant}} is {{described}} from the Middle Devonian (Givetian) Xichong Formation of Wuding, Yunnan Province, Southwest China. The plant has small <b>axes</b> <b>covered</b> in deltoid spines and a predominantly dichotomous (anisodichotomous) pattern of branching. Elongate sporangia with small distal spines are carried terminally in clusters on short branches {{which have a}} number of close distal dichotomies. These plants, superficially similar to the predominantly Lower Devonian genus Psilophyton, can be distinguished from it by the anisodichotomous nature of the lateral branching systems, by the spiny extensions to the sporangia and by the details of the sporangial attachments. The plant is named Tsaia denticulata Wang et Berry gen. et sp. nov...|$|R
50|$|The film {{begins with}} an unknown person hiding an <b>axe</b> <b>covered</b> with blood in the woods. It then focuses on Brian Hannigan, a {{teenager}} who contacts the police {{after the death of}} his adoptive parents, a double homicide. The investigators immediately see Brian as a suspect, because he was in the house when the murders occurred, is thought to have been too calm considering the circumstances, while also claiming to have heard nothing during the night his parents were murdered. Chris Hannigan, Brian's 7-year-old adoptive brother, tells the police that he saw his other adoptive brother, 17-year-old Daniel, an aggressive patient at a mental hospital, walking away from the house only seconds after the tragedy. Although Daniel denies having been at the house around the time of the murder, he becomes the prime suspect.|$|R

50|$|The {{shape of}} leaf blades in A. tutwilerae is quite variable. The leaves are green in color, not {{leathery}} (unlike some other Asplenium species), and both leaves and their rachides (central <b>axes)</b> are <b>covered</b> by hairs like {{those on the}} upper stipe. Each rachis is similar in color to the stipe at the base, turning green and dull towards {{the tip of the}} leaf. In fertile fronds, sori are covered with membraneous indusia, which are attached to the leaf blade at one edge. Within the sori, 64 spores are borne in each sporangium. The species is tetraploid, with a sporophyte chromosome number of 2n = 144.|$|R
2500|$|An axe murderer (Foley) {{approaches}} {{people for}} favours {{after he has}} obviously committed a brutal and grisly homicide with the <b>axe</b> he's carrying. <b>Covered</b> in blood, he makes polite small talk with people he runs into, casually admitting he is, in fact, an axe murderer. Before leaving, he amiably asks whoever he talks to not to tell anyone or [...] "Chop chop!", accompanied by a chopping motion with his axe.|$|R
50|$|The {{murders in}} Colorado Springs were closely related in {{execution}} {{to those in}} the Moore house. Nine months before the Villisca murders, H.C. Wayne, his wife and child and Mrs. A.J. Burnham were found dead in Colorado Springs, murdered by axes. The Colorado Springs Police found it difficult to believe that the same person could perpetrate a similar crime in a city. As in the Villisca murders, bed sheets were used to cover the windows to prevent passersby from looking in. At the Moore house, the murderer hung aprons and skirts to cover the windows. As in the murders in Villisca, the murderer in Colorado Springs wiped the blood off his <b>axe</b> and <b>covered</b> the heads of the victims with bed clothes.|$|R

50|$|Angerstein {{realized}} that their maidservant, Minna Stoll, {{was standing in}} front of him. She ran away and up the stairs to the attic, but just before she reached the door to the attic, Angerstein caught up with her, grabbed her from behind and hit her over the head with the hand-axe, whereupon she collapsed. Angerstein later stated that he killed her because she burned meals, was unclean, and because he and his wife were generally displeased with her. Her body was later found burnt on the first floor. Angerstein then returned to his bedroom and again hacked at the bodies of his mother-in-law and wife, fearing they might get up again. His mother-in-law was still moaning, but Angerstein returned to the kitchen, washed the axe and his hands, sat down and slept for a few hours. When his 18-year-old sister-in-law Ella Barth returned during the night from a train journey, she went upstairs and into the bathroom. Angerstein followed her and killed her with the <b>axe,</b> then <b>covered</b> her up because he could not stand to look at her corpse.|$|R
60|$|Again {{and again}} during the ensuing week the Romans endeavoured to {{penetrate}} the woods, heavy armed troops accompanying the archers. Before they had penetrated far into the forest they found their way arrested by obstacles--lines of felled trees with the branches pointing towards them, and these were only taken after severe loss, the defenders shooting through the green hedge, which was only broken through when working parties with heavy <b>axes</b> came up <b>covered</b> by the spearmen. One party, pushing on incautiously, was suddenly attacked on all sides, and after pouring in their missiles the gladiators charged them, broke {{the ranks of the}} spearmen, and destroyed the whole party, three hundred in number.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{basically}} two tests. The one which {{was first used}} labels the vertices of the simplex with a vector of signs (+/-) of the coordinates of the vertex. For example the vertex (.5,-.2,1.) would be labelled (+,-,+). A simplex is called completely labelled {{if there is a}} vertex whose label begins with a string of [...] "+" [...] signs of length 0,1,2,3,4,...n. A completely labelled simplex contains a neighborhood of the origin. This may be surprising, but what underlies this result is that for each coordinate of a completely labelled simplex there is a vector with [...] "+" [...] and another with a [...] "-". Put another way, the smallest cube with edges parallel to the coordinate <b>axes</b> and which <b>covers</b> the simplex has pairs of faces on opposite sides of 0. (i.e. a [...] "+" [...] and a [...] "-" [...] for each coordinate).|$|R

Porky comes back a lot of axes, and proceeds to chop, but the blades keep breaking. Unknown to him, the squirrel is handing Porky every available axe until he himself (the squirrel) becomes one, but he manages to stop Porky and demands he stops chopping that tree.

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{structures of}} human parvovirus B 19 VP 2 capsids, alone and complexed with its cellular receptor, globoside, have {{been determined to}} 26 resolution. The B 19 capsid structure, reconstructed from cryo-electron micrographs of vitrified specimens, has depressions on the icosahedral 2 -fold and 3 -fold axes, {{as well as a}} canyon-like region around the 5 -fold axes. Similar results had previously been found in an 8 angstrom resolution map derived from x-ray diffraction data. Other parvoviral structures have a cylindrical channel along the 5 -fold icosahedral <b>axes,</b> whereas density <b>covers</b> the 5 -fold axes in B 19. The glycolipid receptor molecules bind into the depressions on the 3 -fold axes of the B 19 :globoside complex. A model of the tetrasaccharide component of globoside, organized as a trimeric fiber, fits well into the difference density representing the globoside receptor. Escape mutations to neutralizing antibodies map onto th capsid surface at regions immediately surrounding the globoside attachment sites. The proximity of the antigenic epitopes to the receptor site suggests that neutralization of virus infectivity is caused by preventing attachment of viruses to cells...|$|R

30|$|The GreenTouch {{consortium}} [58] is {{a worldwide}} large-scale project led by Alcatel-Lucent/Bell Labs with partners from academia, research institutes, operators and fabricants, {{which started in}} January 2010 and with the duration of 5 years that will finish in January 2015. The ambitious goal intended by GreenTouch is to develop the whole architecture needed to reduce {{by a factor of}} 1000 the current levels of energy consumptions in ICT networks. The large-scale proposal of this consortium, as stated in its mission [58], includes the necessary specifications and roadmap to achieve this goal. The projects and <b>axes</b> of GreenTouch <b>cover</b> all the network architecture including the core networking (i.e. switching, routing, transmission, etc.) and the wireless and mobile front-end networks. Their approach can be considered very revolutionary and disruptive. They propose to rethink and reinvent communications systems starting from the principles and only constrained by the law of physics [15, 58]. So far, we can notice a great interest of GreenTouch in specific areas like optical network and photonics, large-scale antenna systems, dynamic wavelength mechanisms and distributed services [59]. Into GreenTouch we also want to highlight the project GREAT from Huawei [60], specialised in the domain of RRM for energy-efficient networks. An important contribution has been made identifying, analysing and modelling the resource trade-offs in mobile networks as mentioned in Section 4 for the power, energy, spectrum, bandwidth, latency and deployment cost variables [46, 61, 62].|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the current plant diversity status {{and the impact of}} drivers of change on the peat basins of the Kromme River peatland. It was conducted at six sites over sixty one years in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. I reviewed the rapid habitat and biodiversity loss of wetlands globally and discussed the distribution of wetlands and specifically peatlands in South Africa. Plant species diversity was assessed using Modified- Whittaker plots. The influence of environmental variables on floristic composition and distribution was investigated using ordination techniques (DCA and CCA). Land use dynamics were assessed by applying GIS techniques on orthorectified aerial images. Six different peat basins were subjectively classified into good, medium and poor condition peat basins. The good condition peat basin (Krugersland) was the most diverse in plant species (4. 1 Shannon-Weiner’s index) (p> 0. 20; F = 11. 04; df = 2), with the highest mean number of plant species (32. 5 ± 3. 4). This was followed by the medium condition class (Kammiesbos) (26. 5 ± 9. 0) and poor condition class (Companjesdrift) (22. 5 ± 8. 9). On average, species composition was not evenly distributed across the peat basins (p> 0. 21; F = 0. 94; df = 2), since 77. 8 % of the Shannon-Weiner evenness index obtained were less than one. However, there were variations in plant species richness across six peat basins as confirmed by Oneway ANOVA test (p= 0. 0008, F = 1241. 6, df = 4). Key environmental variables that influenced plant species distribution and structure were erosion and grazing intensity, potassium, phosphorus, soil pH and calcium. Total species variance accounted for in the first two <b>axes</b> for ground <b>cover</b> and plant height were 40. 7 % and 56. 4 % respectively. Alien species (e. g. Acacia mearnsii and Conyza scabrida) were common in degraded peat basins, whereas good condition peat basins supported indigenous species (e. g., Cyperus denudatus, Chrysanthemoides monolifera and Digitaria eriantha). Analysis of aerial images revealed a general progressive decrease in the peatland area between 1942 and 1969 in the good (Krugersland) and poor (Companjesdrift) condition class, with a marginal increase from 1969 to 2003. Peatland area in the good and poor condition class decreased by 5. 3 % and 8. 3 % respectively between 1942 and 1969, with a marginal increase of 1. 5 % and 4. 1 % respectively from 1969 to 2003. Annual net rate of change in peatland area over the 61 year period was - 0. 32 % (good condition class) and - 0. 79 % (poor condition class). Transformed lands were impacted by drivers of change such as alien invasives, agricultural activities, erosion and sediment transport. The area under alien invasives increased by 50 % between 1942 and 2003, with an annual net rate of change of + 0. 82 (good condition class) and + 1. 63 % (poor condition class) ...|$|R
40|$|The common {{configuration}} for deflecting {{laser beams}} in two dimensions {{is based on}} two single-axis galvanometric scanners placed perpendicular to each other. Over recent years, these fast scanners {{have proved to be}} both very reliable and very accurate. They are widely available in the marketplace and have wide-ranging technical specifications. However, such a configuration is rather bulky and can not satisfy the needs of industry which seeks compact solutions for an easy integration of these scanning heads into their production lines. In addition, two separate mirrors leads to optical aberrations when these scanning heads are used in conjunction with scanning lenses, which are specially designed for a single entrance pupil. Therefore, a compact fast-steering tip/tilt laser scanner with a single mirror would act as a key component in diverse applications, e. g. in material processing, astronomy, intersatellite laser communications, imaging systems, bio-medical and ophthalmologic applications. The compact two-axis tilt laser scanner presented in this work can perform a variety of functions such as image tracking, beam stabilization and alignment, line-of-sight pointing, and scene scanning. Designing such a scanner required a multi-disciplinary approach involving optics, mechanics, electromagnetics, sensors and control theories. The scanner is composed of one single mirror with a large active area and has a single point of rotation for the two axes of tilt. Moreover, the center of gravity coincides with the center of rotation to reach optimum dynamic behavior. The scanner's compact dimensions allow an easy integration in the various optical systems. Furthermore, the mirror is easily interchangeable which gives greater flexibility in the choice of the laser source. Another major advantage of the proposed design is its ability to be scaled down to miniaturized versions. The scaling depends mainly on the active surface of the mirror, which is generally specified by the application. The larger the mirror, the higher its inertia and the larger are the actuators in order to guarantee high performance. Two pairs of push-pull linear electromagnetic actuators are used to drive the mirror of the scanner. The mirror suspension is based on a sliding bearing composed of a cone-ball contact with optimized friction and wear behavior. A magnetic pre-load force is used to hold the mirror and to give sufficient rotational stiffness. Furthermore, a position transducer based on a photodetector and a miniature laser pen is integrated in the module and is used for closed loop feedback positioning. The mirror can be tilted around both axes by ± 61 mrad (± 3. 5 °) with an accuracy better than 50 μrad. Moreover, a differential resolution in the order of 2. 5 μrad, and settling times for maximum tip and tilt deflections of 10 ms and 14 ms respectively are achieved. The overall volume of the scanner is 30 x 40 x 50 mm 3, and its total weight does not exceed 90 g. Design, simulations and experimental investigations were carried out in this work in order to optimize the different components of the tip/tilt scanner. These components are: the motors, the bearing system, the position transducer and the feedback control loop. An analytical model that allows an optimization of the geometrical parameters for an electromagnetic actuator based on rectangular coils and magnets is proposed. This model proved to be very reliable and can be extended to the design of a variety of electromagnetic driving systems. In addition, an extensive analysis of the beam path distortions generated when a single mirror is pivoted around two <b>axes</b> is <b>covered.</b> Furthermore, correcting equations used to compensate for the systematic errors resulting from this configuration are proposed. The tip/tilt scanner is suited to a variety of applications in industrial material laser processing. These applications are not just restricted to conventional processes like welding, cutting, drilling, and marking, but also to new technologies such as micro-manipulation of parts by laser. In this new approach, bending and shrinkage of the material result due to laser irradiation, allowing fast adjustment and positioning of micro-mechanical and opto-mechanical components with sub-micron accuracy. Furthermore, local annealing of shape memory alloys, leading to stiffness variation in monolithic parts such as micro-grippers, represents a very innovative application in smart materials. On the other hand, the scanner is also a key component in bio-medical and ophthalmologic applications. The first measurements carried out with the scanner for optical tomography of the retina appeared very promising. Furthermore, an optical tweezers set-up has been realized using the scanner, allowing easy and flexible manipulation of laser beam trapped cells and molecules...|$|R
40|$|The town of Valasske Mezirici lies in {{the foothills}} of the Moravian-Silesian Beskids, which imparts a {{specific}} architectural character. Historical roots dating back to the Middle Ages can be traced in its urban structure. The core of the town is defined by three lines – the Becva River and two important thoroughfares, which refer to the historical context. The centre with its character is in marked contrast to the surrounding, predominantly residential development. Thus a spatial conflict arises that defines the boundary between the town and housing, the boundary between ‘the old and new’, or ‘the big and small’. The plot intended for the design lies on this border as well. The structure of the historic core of the town is specified by the fact that all public spaces, main facades and the elements of a town parter are oriented towards the main square. But on the other hand, it is falling apart gradually. This fact destroys the historical ties connected with the fortification walls which once delimited the centre clearly and thus enabled it to preserve its distinctive urban character. The idea of ‘definition’ and closing of the centre is making sense again after the construction of gigantic buildings in the neighbourhood. The design is drawn up on the basis of this reasoning. The building fills the space in the southern part of the former fortification system and closes the axis leading away from the main square. This gesture of the closure highlights the importance of the historical ties and the central character of the town core structure. It has no ambition to become a destination point. It only regulates the way of how the town is perceived, directs the citizens towards its major spaces and prevents the diffusion of the centre and the periphery. A new face goal is set by the curving the facade facing the centre. It is a noticeable tree located at the intersection of the ring road of the inner circle of the former fortification walls and the pedestrian communication leading from the periphery to the centre. Besides, a new urban area, supported by the height gradation of the mass of the building is delimited here. The newly created line connects the centre with the periphery. It replaces the original subway and thus provides a more dignified possibility of entering the town than from the underground. The building has a shape of a closed block – it delimits the entire plot and thereby reflects the need to build underground garages across its whole area. Hence an urban cliché does not arise and what can be found above the ground corresponds to what is underneath. The entire volume is divided into three parts as for the mass and operation. The importance of their function increases gradually. Thanks to this gradation the breaking of the large volume is achieved and at the same time the hygiene requirements are met. The individual masses are separated by an orthogonal system of communication <b>axes</b> created by <b>covered</b> galleries, which can be traced on the facades through the entire height...|$|R
