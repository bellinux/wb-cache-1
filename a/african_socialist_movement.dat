50|$|The NSDAP/AO {{arrived in}} South Africa in 1932 {{and as a}} result a number of groups {{sympathetic}} to Nazism emerged. The most notable of these was the South <b>African</b> Gentile National <b>Socialist</b> <b>Movement</b> (also known as the South <b>African</b> Christian National <b>Socialist</b> <b>Movement),</b> formed by Louis Weichardt the following year. A fiercely anti-Semitic group, it organised the Gryshemde as its equivalent of the Sturmabteilung, although the grey shirt became so associated with the group that it was applied to the movement as a whole. In contrast to some extremist groups the Greyshirts did not split along linguistic lines, but rather sought to work with both the Afrikaans and the English-speaking populations.|$|R

50|$|Nazism {{found an}} {{audience}} in the country, with pro-Nazi elements organised by Louis Weichardt in 1932 under the name South <b>African</b> Gentile National <b>Socialist</b> <b>Movement,</b> a group that soon {{became known as the}} Greyshirts. Although the group enjoyed some support and continued after the Second World War they never became sufficiently important for the government to take action against them. The other main fascist group was the Ossewabrandwag (OB), founded in 1939, a group also inspired by Adolf Hitler. The two differed however as the Greyshirts emphasised Aryan race rhetoric and so organised amongst the various white immigrant communities whilst the OB were specifically for Afrikaner only. A third, more minor group, the New Order, emerged in 1940 under the leadership of former cabinet minister Oswald Pirow. After the Second World War Pirow became an important figure in neo-fascism, working closely with Oswald Mosley, Nation Europa and A. F. X. Baron. Nazi Germany sought to encourage such activity with former Olympic boxer Robey Leibbrandt active as an agent for the Abwehr during the war. The Nazi Party itself also organised until it was outlawed in 1936.|$|R
