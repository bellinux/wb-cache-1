Although the general public has held a {{stereotype}} of heavy metal fans being suicidal, depressed and a danger to themselves and society in general. However, Adrian North, a Heriot-Watt University professor who studies genre listeners found that metal listeners were above all else creative, at ease with themselves and introverted — qualities he also found in classical listeners.|$|E
5|$|Extinct North American cats {{resembling}} the cheetah had historically {{been assigned to}} Felis, Puma or Acinonyx. However, a phylogenetic analysis in 1990 placed these species under the genus Miracinonyx. Miracinonyx exhibited {{a high degree of}} similarity with the cheetah. However, in 1998, a DNA analysis showed that Miracinonyx inexpectatus, M.studeri, and M.trumani (early to late Pleistocene epoch), found in North America, are not true cheetahs; in fact, they <b>are</b> <b>close</b> relatives of the cougar.|$|E

5|$|Most notable part of Ninja Gaiden, which {{certainly}} made it famous, was its unforgiving, challenging difficulty, especially with very steep platforms, enemies that respawn upon dying unless they <b>are</b> <b>close</b> enough, aerial enemies and complicated platforming sections, all combined, make Ninja Gaiden {{one of the}} hardest games on the NES, and its difficulty setting earned it both praise and criticism.|$|E

5|$|Ordinary {{supernova}} explosions {{can have}} the same effects as GRBs on Earth's atmosphere if they <b>are</b> <b>close</b> enough.

5|$|The late Norman chapter house, {{situated}} {{south of}} the transept, contains {{some of the first}} uses of pointed arches in England. It also has a rich sculptural decoration, with a variety of Romanesque abstract motifs. In both of these aspects there <b>are</b> <b>close</b> similarities with the abbey gatehouse, supporting the view that the two structures were built around the same time in the 12thcentury, as put forward by Street in the 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|There <b>are</b> <b>close</b> {{parallels}} between the 5th-century architecture and monuments of Quiriguá and Uaxactun in the northern Petén, a site that fell under the domination of Tikal in the late 4th century.
