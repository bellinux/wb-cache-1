[...] Heller described his character as [...] "very much a Roman of the Old School, a stoic man devoted to duty and religion and the legion." [...] Ray Stevenson played Titus Pullo, a soldier who befriends Vorenus. McKidd said that [...] "they're kind of thrown together by fate, by chance, but somewhere along the line they start to stick... keep finding themselves accidentally at the epicenter of tumultuous events and immense change, so they're kind of clinging to each other." ...|$|E

500|$|British {{production}} company Granada TV approached Ray Davies in early January 1969, expressing {{interest in developing}} <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>or</b> play for television.

Agreements were finalised on 8 January, but the project was not revealed until a press release on 10 March. Separately, the Kinks began work on the programme's companion record, entitled Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). Development of Arthur occurred during a rough period for the band, due to the commercial failure of their previous album The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society and the subsequent single, [...] "Plastic Man", {{as well as the}} departure of founding member and bassist Pete Quaife. In early 1969, Quaife had told the band he was quitting, though the other members did not take the remark seriously. When an article in the New Musical Express mentioned Maple Oak, the band that he had formed without the rest of the Kinks' knowledge, Davies unsuccessfully asked Quaife to return for the upcoming sessions of Arthur. As a replacement, Davies called up bassist John Dalton, who had previously filled in for Quaife.|$|E

It's connected in the way that the shows come from the same place, that they are real, that they are grounded." [...] Eric Carroll, producer on , felt with the introduction of Queens-based Spider-Man to the MCU it [...] "would be really fun" [...] to make mention of the Defenders based in Manhattan, adding, [...] "it’s definitely a card I would love to see played, if not sooner rather than later." ...|$|E
