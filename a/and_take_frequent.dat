5000|$|The rosy-faced lovebird (Agapornis roseicollis), {{also known}} as the rosy-collared or peach-faced lovebird, is a species of lovebird native to arid regions in southwestern Africa such as the Namib Desert. A loud and {{constant}} chirper, these birds are very social animals and often congregate in small groups in the wild. They eat throughout the day <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>frequent</b> baths. Coloration can vary widely among populations. Plumage is identical in males and females. Lovebirds are renowned for their sleep position in which they sit side-by-side and turn their faces in towards each other. Also, females are well noted to tear raw materials into long strips, [...] "twisty-tie" [...] them onto their backs, and fly substantial distances back to make a nest. They are common in the pet industry, although lovebirds are often not hand-raised.|$|E

They performed three times, with these performances involving the band wearing Tom Baker-esque hats and scarves, the audience bopping, and visuals of the Bernard Lodge credit sequence being mixed in. In addition, Paul Martinelli substituted for Dave Christopher (because, according to Gallacher, [...] "he wasn't good looking enough") and in what Gallacher called a [...] "welcome irony" [...] Graham Hollingworth on drums. It is unknown why they were engaged, however Gallacher suggested {{they may have been}} on tour with Cliff Richard. However, miming to the track was not allowed due to instructions from the Musicians' Union and thus they had to re-record it and then mime to that. This was next to impossible; though the musicians were capable of recording the backing track in one take, Gallacher and Stevens had spent days overdubbing keyboards and synthesizers, which couldn't be redone in three hours. Thus, they Gallacher told the members to arrive before the Union representative arrives, and that they would [...] "pretend" [...] to re-record the track. However, Dave Green, the bass player, heeded no such instruction and arrived later, leading to Gallacher needing to hit [...] "talkback" [...] and give instructions to Green <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>frequent</b> [...] "trips to the loo". On one of his bog breaks, Gallacher found Green ascending the stairs, whispered to him instructions, and he snuck into the studio.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE:: An {{umbilical}} arterial catheter {{is often}} used to monitor blood pressure <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>frequent</b> blood samples in the very low birth weight newborn infant requiring neonatal intensive care.

The Umbilical Arterial Catheter Calculation Study, Australian Perinatal Trials Register PT 0398, was set up to investigate this technical change.

And in general, let the person drink as much as they wish. The person can drink a little faster at first and then relatively slowly. For babies, a dropper or syringe without the needle may be used.

50|$|WHO/UNICEF {{guidelines}} suggest ORT {{should begin}} {{at the first sign}} of diarrhea in order to prevent dehydration. Babies may be given ORS with a dropper or a syringe.

WHO recommends giving children under two a quarter- to a half-cup of fluid following each loose bowel movement and older children a half- to a full cup. If the person vomits, the caretaker should wait 5-10 minutes and then resume giving ORS. ORS may be given by aid workers or health care workers in refugee camps, health clinics and hospital settings. Mothers should remain with their children and be taught how to give ORS. This will help to prepare them to give ORT at home in the future. Breastfeeding should be continued throughout ORT.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Background: With {{increasing}} use {{of computers}} by young adults in educational institutions {{as well as at}} home {{there is a need to}} investigate whether students are adopting ergonomic principles when using computers. Objective: To assess the practice of students on ergonomic principles while working on computers and their association with the symptoms of Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS). Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted among the undergraduate students using pre-tested structured questionnaire on the demographic profile, practice of ergonomic principles and symptoms of CVS experienced while on continuous computer work within the past one month duration. Results: Out of 416 students studied, 50 % of them viewed computer at a distance of 20 to 28 inches, 61 % viewed the computer screen at the same level, 42. 8 % placed the reference material between monitor and key board, 24. 5 % tilted screen backward, 75. 7 % <b>took</b> <b>frequent</b> breaks <b>and</b> 56. 0 % blinked frequently to prevent CVS.

5000|$|James Pinkney Havard {{was born}} in Galveston, Texas, in 1937. He {{received}} a bachelor of science degree in art from Sam Houston State College (now Sam Houston State University) in Huntsville, Texas, in 1959. From 1961 to 1965 he studied at Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. There he was influenced by realist painters Ben Kamihira and Hobson Pittman. His career {{can be divided into}} three broad periods: realism (1960s), abstract illusionism (1970s), and abstract expressionism with tribal and outsider influences (1980s and beyond). “His early work was [...] [...] [...] realistic and traditional, including landscapes, churches, and figuration much in the same styles as Camille Corot, Édouard Manet, and Edgar Degas.” Beginning in 1967, he broke away from realism and went through a period of experimentation with various abstract and contemporary styles (e.g., monochromatic paintings). By the late 1970s Havard was considered {{one of the founders of}} abstract illusionism along with Al Held, Jack Lembeck, John Clem Clarke, George D. Green, and Tony King. His work during this period is characterized by pastel colors, “optical illusions and combinations of gesso wipes, chalk scrawls, incised lines, and squirts of paint directly from the tube.” In 1976, one art critic wrote of his paintings, [...] "Though conveived to fool the eye, Havard's paintings are at once daring and subtle, complex in scheme and simplistic in symbolic reference." [...] He moved to New York in 1977 <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>frequent</b> trips to Santa Fe, New Mexico, beginning in 1978. In New York, his color palette darkened and his works became richer in texture. He began including Native American images and Native American words (e.g., mimbres) inscribed in loose script as well as random numbers. During the 1980s Havard’s paintings began to include thicker layers of paint, more collage elements, and fewer squiggles of paint and optical illusions. He moved to Santa Fe in 1989 where he continued to develop his style, ultimately freeing himself from all references to abstract illusionism. His later paintings have fewer overt tribal references and are smaller in size than many of his earlier pieces. One critic accused Havard's paintings of [...] "displaying the female body with what comes off as a misogynistic vigor." [...] Havard began to use an encaustic medium that allowed him to incise the surface of the painting which gave them a carved, luminous appearance. His palette varies from dark, rich, and contrasting colors to bright blues and reds. Rich textures and visually arresting but crudely rendered figures define his work. Many of his paintings seem visually dense. One collector of Havard's paintings remembered his initial uniformed response to them: [...] "What a mixed up mess these are." [...] In 2006 Havard suffered a stroke but continues to paint. Ironically, this well-trained artist who for many years was inspired by outsider art has become an outsider himself in the sense that he now paints with the constraints of a physical handicap. Due to Havard's limited mobility, his most recent works are small in scale, but [...] "are nonetheless extremely powerful, perhaps even more so because the reduced format concentrates them." ...|$|R
