25|$|There are {{two main}} routes for {{geological}} methane generation, organic (thermogenic), and inorganic (abiotic, meaning non-living). Thermally generated methane, {{is referred to as}} thermogenic, originating from deeper sedimentary strata. Thermogenic methane (CH4) formation occurs due to the break-up of organic matter, forced by elevated temperatures and pressures. This type of methane is considered to be the primary methane type in sedimentary basins, and from an economical perspective the most important source of natural gas. Thermogenic methane components are generally considered to be relic (from an earlier time). Generally, formation of thermogenic methane (at depth), can occur through organic matter break-up, or organic synthesis, both ways can involve microorganisms (methanogenesis) but may also occur inorganically. The involved anaerobic and <b>aerobic</b> <b>processes</b> can also consume methane, with and without microorganisms.The more important source of methane at depth (crystalline bedrock) is abiotic.

40|$|International audienceOxygen {{availability}} drives {{changes in}} microbial diversity and biogeochemical cycling between the aerobic surface layer and the anaerobic core in nitrite-rich anoxic marine zones (AMZs), which constitute huge oxygen-depleted {{regions in the}} tropical oceans. The current paradigm is that primary production and nitrification within the oxic surface layer fuel anaerobic processes in the anoxic core of AMZs, where 30 - 50 % of global marine nitrogen loss takes place. Here we demonstrate that oxygenic photosynthesis in the secondary chlorophyll maximum (SCM) releases significant amounts of O 2 to the otherwise anoxic environment.
