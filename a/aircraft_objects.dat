The detection of a potential conflict is achieved by projecting states of the conflicting aircrafts' flight plans in the near future.

40|$|Abstract. The Mobility Aircraft Availability Forecasting (MAAF) model {{requirements}} definition research {{effort was}} initiated {{to help the}} United States Air Force, Air Mobility Command (AMC) answer the question, “How can we accurately predict mission capable (MC) rates? ” Unfortunately, getting a perfect prediction of aircraft MC rates is not possible, either now or anytime in the foreseeable future. Fortunately, there are viable alternatives to prediction, and these alternatives are what the MAAF effort sought to determine. The mission of the AMC is to provide airlift, air refueling, special air mission, and aeromedical evacuation for the U. S. forces. AMC also supplies forces to theater commands to support wartime tasking. Currently, the AMC does not possess the capability to forecast, assess or evaluate alternatives impacting aircraft availability, which {{is key to the}} AMC decision-making process. Current methods utilize “after the fact ” analyses and user opinion. This deficiency makes it difficult to perform quick, accurate, and effective analyses of potential limiting factors, and policy changes. This paper describes the MAAF simulation model built as the analytical component of a prototype decision support system aimed at providing AMC managers the dynamic, predictive tools needed to better forecast aircraft availability. This simulation featured new capabilities for mobility modeling to include dynamic definition of the airbases within a mobility system, a dynamic definition of the capabilities of the individual airbases within the mobility system, improved representation of the <b>aircraft</b> <b>objects</b> within the model, and a new approach to modeling aircraft maintenance to include a first ever motion of partially mission capable aircraft. The development efforts and experimental results are recounted in this paper. 1...|$|E
40|$|This {{essay is}} Part One of a two-part essay series. It {{outlines}} and evaluates two possible future international instruments. Each instrument draws substantial {{inspiration from the}} Cape Town Convention and its Aircraft Protocol (together, the “Convention”). The Convention governs the secured financing and leasing of large commercial aircraft, aircraft engines, and helicopters. It entered into force in 2006. It has been adopted by sixty Contracting States (fifty-four of which have adopted the Aircraft Protocol), including the U. S., China, the E. U., India, Ireland, Luxembourg, Russia, and South Africa. A novel, distinctive, and path-breaking feature of the Convention is the international registry for the registration (i. e., public notice) of international interests in <b>aircraft</b> <b>objects.</b> It is a completely electronic, computer-based registry operated out of Ireland. It is operational 24 - 7. Inspired by the Convention’s international registry, Part One proposes {{a different sort of}} international registry—one of general application. This registry would constitute the national registry for each adopting State that would provide public notice of security interests in personal property (movables) created under the State’s domestic substantive law on secured transactions. Part One explores the potential scope and structure of such a registry and its benefits as well as the potential means of creation, implementation, and operation of such a registry. It also examines the feasibility of a project on an international registry of general application. Part One concludes that there is a plausible basis for the feasibility of such a project. It urges interested States and intergovernmental organizations to seriously consider an international registry project and to take preliminary steps toward more formal consideration and discussion...|$|E
40|$|Image {{template}} matching {{is essential in}} image analysis and computer vision tasks. Cross-correlation algorithms are often used in practice, but they are sensitive to nonlinear changes in image intensity and random noise, and are computation-ally expensive. In this paper, we propose a template-matching algorithm based on a modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) procedure with a mutual information (MI) similarity measure. The influence of MI {{on the performance of}} {{template matching}}, calculated by different histogram bins, is analyzed first. A modified PSO method (CRI-PSO) is then presented. The proposed algorithm is tested with remote sensing imagery from different sensors and for different seasons. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is robust in practical scenarios and outperforms the standard PSO, multi-start PSO, and cross-correlation algorithms in accuracy and efficiency with our test data. The proposed method can be used for position estimation of <b>aircraft,</b> <b>object</b> recognition, and image retrieval...|$|R

40|$|This work {{examines}} {{security interests}} under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment. The {{main purpose of}} the Convention {{is to provide a}} uniform legal regime for the creation, registration and protection of a creditor’s interests held in high value types of mobile equipment, such as aircraft, railway and space objects. The Convention provides for the creation of an autonomous international interest in these types of equipment and establishes an electronic International Registry for recordation of interests in <b>aircraft</b> <b>objects.</b> The international interests are supported by an elaborate system of remedies exercisable {{in the case of the}} debtor’s default or insolvency. These features of the Convention are aimed at promoting predictability and transparency in the financing of mobile equipment which should reduce the risks and costs of borrowing to the benefit of all stake holders. The work examines such issues as the problems of the definition and creation of security interests as well as the possibility of the creation of a floating security under the Convention. It also explores the aims and assesses the effectiveness of the registration system established under the Convention. Next, the thesis examines the rules of the Convention on setting priorities between competing creditors. Finally, the work explored the remedies (and their effectiveness) available to the creditor. One of the aims of this work is to examine the provisions of the Convention and to test whether the legal regime created by it can operate successfully and help facilitate financing of high value equipment. In order to test the effectiveness of the Convention, its provisions will be evaluated in the context of various factual scenarios, which, considering the absence of cases under the Convention, were largely inspired by the experience of some major domestic jurisdictions, such as the UK and the US. This exercise may also shed some light on strengths and weaknesses of the Convention in comparison with these systems. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
