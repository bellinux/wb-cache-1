5|$|Bruix, {{named after}} Admiral Étienne Eustache Bruix, was laid {{down at the}} Arsenal de Rochefort on 9 November 1891. She was {{launched}} on 2 August 1894 and commissioned for trials on 15 April 1896. The ship was temporarily assigned to the Northern Squadron (Escadre du Nord) on 24 November for the visit of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and his wife to Dunkerque on 5–9 October. The ship's steering broke down on 7 October <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> return to Rochefort for repairs. Trials lasted until early December and Bruix was officially commissioned on 15 December and assigned to the Northern Squadron.|$|E

5|$|Cressy, {{named after}} the 1346 Battle of Crécy, was laid down by Fairfield Shipbuilding at their {{shipyard}} in Govan, Scotland on 12 October 1898 and launched on 4 December 1899. After finishing her sea trials she passed into the fleet reserve at Portsmouth on 24 May 1901. She was commissioned by Captain Henry Tudor for service on the China Station on 28 May 1901, but her departure was delayed for several months when her steering gear broke down shortly after leaving the base <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> return. She eventually left home waters in early October 1901, arriving at Colombo on 7 November, and then Singapore on 16 November. She {{was assigned to the}} North America and West Indies Station from 1907 through 1909 and placed in reserve upon her return home.|$|E
5|$|Marianne {{moved in}} with Pontecorvo at the Hôtel des Grands Hommes on the Place du Panthéon on 4 January 1938. Their son Gil was born on 30 July. Her visa expired, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> return to Sweden in September. Pontecorvo {{accompanied}} her, leaving Gil behind in a residential nursery in Paris. Travelling back to Paris alone, he dined with Manne Siegbahn and met with Niels Bohr and Lisa Meitner on 12 October 1938. Pontecorvo was now unable to return to Italy because of the Fascist regime's racial laws against the Jews. This caused {{the breakup of the}} Via Panisperna boys, with Fermi moving to the United States. Pontecorvo's family also dispersed. Guido moved to Britain in 1938, followed by Giovanni, Laura and Anna in 1939, while Gillo joined Pontecorvo in Paris.|$|E
5|$|On 23 January 2010, Gorrostieta Salazar was {{attacked}} by armed men in Ciudad Altamirano, Guerrero, while returning from a local event with four other people.

Also injured were the driver of the vehicle, who was shot twice; Marbella Reyes Ortoño, head of the Institute of Women in Tiquicheo; and Fanny Almazán Gómez, a journalist from El Sol de Morelia. In addition to the bullet wounds, Gorrostieta Salazar suffered further injuries when the vehicle crashed after the shooting. Her wounds left her in constant pain <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> use a colostomy bag, but she refused to resign her post as mayor.

5|$|The {{ship was}} sold to the Peruvian Navy in 1912, but they never paid the last two {{installments}} and the ship remained inactive at Brest during World War I. The French agreed to take the ship back in 1917, keeping the money already paid, and they sold her in 1918 to a Belgian shipping company that converted her into a freighter. Renamed Péruvier, the ship's engines broke down <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be towed to her destination where part of her cargo of coal was discovered to be on fire during her maiden voyage as a merchant vessel in 1920. Deemed uneconomical to repair, Péruvier was towed to Antwerp and later scrapped in 1923.|$|E
5|$|To the east, Orion and Queen {{forced the}} {{surrender}} of both Northumberland and Jemmappes, although Queen was unable to secure Jemmappes <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be abandoned later. Queen especially was badly damaged and unable to make the British lines again, wallowing between the newly reformed French fleet and the British battleline along with several other shattered ships.(Manderson served as a lieutenant aboard HMS Queen) Royal George and Glory had between them disabled Scipion and Sans Pareil in a bitter exchange, but were also too badly damaged themselves to take possession. All four ships were among those left drifting in {{the gap between the}} fleets.|$|E

After the war, she retired to the family home on property she had purchased in 1859 in Auburn, New York, where she cared for her aging parents. She {{was active in the}} women's suffrage movement until illness overtook her <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be admitted to a home for elderly African Americans that she had helped to establish years earlier.

5|$|As {{the threat}} of a German naval attack had been removed by the {{destruction}} of the East Asia Squadron, Australia was free for deployment elsewhere. Initially, the battlecruiser was to serve as flagship of the West Indies Squadron, with the task of pursuing and destroying any German vessels that evaded North Sea blockades. Australia was ordered to sail to Jamaica via the Panama Canal, but as it was closed to heavy shipping, she was forced to sail down the coast of South America and pass through the Strait of Magellan during 31 December 1914 and 1 January 1915—Australia is the only ship of the RAN to cross from the Pacific to the Atlantic by sailing under South America. During the crossing, one of the warship's propellers was damaged, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> limp to the Falkland Islands at half speed. Temporary repairs were made, and Australia departed on 5 January. A vessel well clear of the usual shipping routes was spotted on the afternoon of the next day, and the battlecruiser attempted to pursue, but was hampered by the damaged propeller. Unable to close the gap before sunset, a warning shot was fired from 'A' turret, which caused the ship—the former German passenger liner, now naval auxiliary Eleonora Woermann—to stop and be captured. As Australia could not spare enough personnel to secure and operate the merchant ship, and Eleonora Woermann was too slow {{to keep pace with the}} battlecruiser, the German crew were taken aboard and the ship was sunk.|$|E
5|$|Even before Monitor was commissioned, she ran an {{unsuccessful}} set of sea trials on 19 February. Valve {{problems with the}} main engine {{and one of the}} fan engines prevented her from reaching the Brooklyn Navy Yard from Greenpoint <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be towed there the next day. These issues were easily fixed and Monitor was ordered to sail for Hampton Roads on 26 February, but her departure had to be delayed one day to load ammunition. On the morning of 27 February the ship entered the East River preparatory to leaving New York, but proved to be all but unsteerable and had to be towed back to the navy yard. Upon examination, the steering gear controlling the rudder had been improperly installed and Rowland offered to realign the rudder, which he estimated to take only a day. Ericsson, however, preferred to revise the steering gear by adding an extra set of pulleys as he believed it would take less time. His modification proved to be successful during trials on 4 March. Gunnery trials were successfully performed the previous day, although Stimers twice nearly caused disasters as he did not understand how the recoil mechanism worked on Ericsson's carriage for the 11-inch guns. Instead of tightening them to reduce the recoil upon firing, he loosened them so that both guns struck the back of the turret, fortunately without hurting anybody or damaging the guns.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Eckoldt was {{allocated}} to Group 2 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserübung. The group's {{task was to}} transport the 138th Mountain Infantry Regiment (138. Gebirgsjäger Regiment) to seize Trondheim together with Admiral Hipper. The ships began loading troops on 6 April and set sail the next day. Eckoldts port propeller shaft began to overheat shortly after passing {{the mouth of the}} Elbe River <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> slow down. The ship managed to repair the problem and joined the main body later in the day. The ship escorted Admiral Hipper as they entered Trondheim Fjord and both ships disembarked their troops once they reached Trondheim harbor. All of the German ships proved to be very low on fuel after their journey and fuel oil was transferred to Eckoldt from Theodor Riedel and Heinemann. Admiral Hipper and Eckoldt attempted to leave on the night of 10 April, but the smaller ship proved to be unable to match Admiral Hippers speed in the heavy seas encountered and was forced to turn back. After some fuel was discovered in Trondheim on 12 April, the ship and Heinemann sailed for Germany two days later.|$|E
