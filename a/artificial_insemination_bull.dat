To confirm and refine the location of this QTL, the original detection experiment was extended by adding 12 new families and genotyping 25 additional microsatellite markers (including 11 newly developed markers). Data were then analyzed by an approach combining both linkage and linkage disequilibrium information, making it possible to identify two linked QTL separated by 20 cM corresponding to âˆ¼ 29 Mb. The presence of a QTL affecting protein yield was confirmed but its position was found to be more telomeric than the two QTLunderlying fat yield. Each identified QTL affecting milk fat yield was physically mapped within a segment estimated to be < 500 kb. Two strong functional candidate genes involved, respectively, in fatty acid metabolism and membrane permeability were found to be localized within this segment while other functional candidate genes were discarded.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the project was to provide {{assistance}} in investigating the possibilities of increasing milk production, and smallholder incomes, by providing milk production and processing inputs to user groups. The objectives of the project were to set up two pilot self-reliant user groups to improve milk production and cattle production in rural areas; to assess the potential of the concept of user groups for improving cattle production, both for milk and draught; and to train operators within the community in the basic skills of milk handling and processing, <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination,</b> <b>bull</b> handling, and improving crop residue utilizationTwo sites were selected: Sike Denema in Southern Shewa Administrative Region and Lemu Chemeri in Arsi Administrative Region. Forty-three smallholders in Sike Denema and eleven smallholders in Lemu Chemeri agreed to form user groups. Two user groups were set up, in spite of difficulties resulting from the smallholders' previous unfortunate experience with group work and group ownershipFurther difficulties were experienced by the project due to the interruption of freight services during the period of political turmoil, with the result that not all project equipment and supplies were delivered. Training activities were also undermined {{as a result of the}} security problems in the summer of 1991. Although plans were made for the construction of project facilities at both sites, construction did not begin, as the project was unable to obtain the locally-generated World Food Programme funds it needed on timeA detailed base-line survey of the forty-three user group members' households in Sike Denema was carried out. Data were collected on household size, age structure, gender ratios, the responsibilities of household members, income, farm size, livestock holdings, crops, and husbandry practices. A proposed similar survey in Lemu Chemeri was postponed, because of the security problems in June 1991. Fodder, tree seedlings, grass seeds and pasture legume seed, however, were distributed at both sites in time for the 1991 growing seasonAlthough much initial effort was expended in selecting the two sites, and in setting up the user groups, this was not followed up adequately during the second half of the project, due, mainly, to the fact that the project inputs were not delivered to the groups, as a result of the lack of the expected World Food Programme funds, and the poor security situation, during the last six months of the project, that made travelling to project sites dangerous. The project also suffered as a result of smallholders' reluctance to be involved in group work: in retrospect, it is clear that user groups themselves should have been consulted before any selection of groups was madeThe main task that lay ahead for the Ministry in this field was to decide, together with the smallholders, how best to develop dairying in the rural areas. In Lemu Chemeri there seemed to be a strong desire among smallholders to develop dairying on an individual basis, rather than on a group basis. However, as the quantity of milk processed daily is very low, it was unrealistic to suppose that dairy processing on an individual basis could be profitable. Dairy processing and milk marketing, therefore, should be developed through smallholder groups that could manage a common dairy unit. Although there remained some unwillingness to market milk on a group basis, the Sike Denema smallholders were more willing to work in groups. Should the Ministry of Agriculture wish to pursue development of dairying through user groups, the Sike Denema site therefore appeared to have more potentialOnce it has been decided, in consultation with the smallholders, on how best to proceed with the development of smallholder dairying, the sites chosen should be re- examined in terms of their physical potential. Lemu Chemeri was an excellent site for the production of milk; Sike Denema, on the other hand, was not. In Sike Denema, heavy concentration on dairy cattle nutrition over a period of several years would be necessary in order to make it a good dairying site. In terms of operating and supervising a project, it might be preferable to choose two sites that are closer together. Once the Ministry has decided on the sites, construction of the facilities could beginThe Ministry should also now begin training smallholders. Outside technical assistance could be needed to help train smallholders in dairy processing, and further technical assistance could be required to investigate marketing. In particular, marketing surveys were needed to discover what milk products consumers want, and in what quantities, so as to determine the feasibility of manufacturing these products and the potential profitability of a dairy processing ventur...|$|E

These bulls were also genotyped for 169 genetic markers, mostly microsatellites. The QTL were analysed by within-sire linear regression of daughter yield deviations or deregressed proofs on the probability that the son receives one or the other paternal QTL allele, given the marker information. QTL were detected for all traits, including those with a low heritability. One hundred and twenty QTL with a chromosome-wise significance lower than 3 % were tabulated. This threshold corresponded to a 15 % false discovery rate. Amongst them, 32 were genome-wise significant. Estimates of their contribution to genetic variance ranged from 6 to 40 %. Most substitution effects ranged from 0. 6 to 1. 0 genetic standard deviation. For a given QTL, only 1 to 5 families out of 14 were informative.

This study used PCR-RFLP method by using HaeIII restriction enzyme. The enzyme cut the GHRH gene at nucleotides of GG|CC at the base positions of 118, 312, and 406 and produced 4 fragments of 118, 194, 94, and 45 bp respectively. Genotyping the GHRH gene produced two types of allele, namely A (312, 94, and 45 bp) and B (194, 118, 94, and 45 bp). These two alleles resulted in three types of genotype, namely AA (312, 94, and 45 bp), AB (312, 194, 118, 94, and 45 bp), and BB (194, 118, 94, and 45 bp). Frequency of the B allele was dominant to the A allele. Chi-Square analysis showed that all of HF dairy and beef cattle observed were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (X 2 < X 2 (0. 05)). The highest heterozygosity value was 0. 471 for HF bulls in LAIC, while the lowest one was for HF bulls in SAIC. Heterozygosity values in Simmental and Limousin cattles were higher than that of in HF cattle.

40|$|Abstract- An {{analysis}} of connectedness in the French Holstein cattle population was carried out. This study {{was motivated by}} the fact that <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> (AI) <b>bulls</b> are evaluated at the national level, whereas they are usually progeny tested only in the region of their AI stud. Connectedness among AI studs was measured by the generalised coefficient of determination (CD) of contrasts between mean breeding values of bulls from the different AI studs. Four connectedness components were distinguished. The relative influence of each component was assessed through the increase in prediction error variance (PEV) of the contrasts after this information was discarded. CDs of contrasts were always higher than 0. 80. Therefore, connectedness level among AI studs was high and provided an accurate national genetic evaluation. Out of the different components of connectedness, withdrawing of proven bull connection data caused the greatest increase in PEV (+ 47. 5 %) primarily due to the change in the connecting structure of the data.

40|$|Most {{dairy cattle}} populations found in {{different}} {{countries around the world}} are small to medium sized and use many <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>bulls</b> imported from different foreign countries. The Walloon population {{in the southern part of}} Belgium is a good example for such a small-scale population. Wallonia has also a very active community of Holstein breeders requesting high level genetic evaluation services. Single-step Genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) methods allow the simultaneous use of genomic, pedigree and phenotypic information and could reduce potential biases in the estimation of genomically enhanced breeding values (GEBV). Therefore, in the context of implementing a Walloon genomic evaluation system for Holsteins, it was considered as the best option. However, in contrast to multi-step genomic predictions, natively ssGBLUP will only use local phenotypic information and is unable to use directly important other sources of information coming from abroad, for example Multiple Across Country Evaluation (MACE) results as provided by the Interbull Center (Uppsala, Sweden). Therefore, we developed and implemented single-step Genomic Bayesian Prediction (ssGBayes), as an alternative method for the Walloon genomic evaluations. The ssGBayes method approximated the correct system of equations directly using estimated breeding values (EBV) and associated reliabilities (REL) without any explicit deregression step. In the Walloon genomic evaluation, local information refers to Walloon EBV and REL and foreign information refers to MACE EBV and associated REL. Combining simultaneously all available genotypes, pedigree, local and foreign information in an evaluation can be achieved but adding contributions to left-hand and right-hand sides subtracting double-counted contributions. Correct propagation of external information avoiding double counting of contributions due to relationships and due to records can be achieved. This ssGBayes method computed more accurate predictions for all types of animals. For example, for genotyped animals with low Walloon REL (< 0. 25) without MACE results but sired by genotyped bulls with MACE results, the average increase of REL for the studied traits was 0. 38 points of which 0. 08 points could be traced to the inclusion of MACE information. For other categories of genotyped animals, the contribution by MACE information was also high. The Walloon genomic evaluation system passed for the first time the Interbull GEBV tests for several traits in July 2013. Recent experiences reported here refer to its use in April 2016 for the routine genomic evaluations of milk production, udder health and type traits. Results showed that the proposed methodology should also be of interest for other, similar, populations. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} genetic parameters for fertility and production traits in the Brown Swiss population reared in the Alps (Bolzano-Bozen province, Italy). Fertility indicators were interval from parturition to first service, interval from first service to conception (iFC), and interval from parturition to conception, either expressed as days and as number of potential 21 -d estrus cycles (cPF, cFC, and cPC, respectively); number of inseminations to conception; conception rate at first service; and non-return rate at 56 d post-first service. Production traits were peak milk yield, lactation milk yield, lactation length, average lactation protein percentage, and average lactation fat percentage. Data included 71, 556 lactations (parities 1 to 9) from 29, 582 cows reared in 1, 835 herds. Animals calved from 1999 to 2007 and were progeny of 491 <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>bulls.</b> Gibbs sampling and Metropolis algorithms were implemented to obtain (co) variance components using both univariate and bivariate censored threshold and linear sire models. All of the analyses accounted for parity and year-month of calving as fixed effects, and herd, permanent environmental cow, additive genetic sire, and residual as random effects. Heritability estimates for fertility traits ranged from 0. 030 (iFC) to 0. 071 (cPC). Strong genetic correlations were estimated between interval from parturition to first service and cPF (0. 97), and interval from parturition to conception and cPC (0. 96). The estimate of heritability for cFC (0. 055) was approximately double compared with iFC (0. 030), suggesting that measuring the elapsed time between first service and conception in days or potential cycles is not equivalent; this was also confirmed by the genetic correlation between iFC and cFC, which was strong (0. 85), but more distant from unity than the other 2 pairs of fertility traits. Genetic correlations between number of inseminations to conception, conception rate at first service, non-return rate at 56 d post-first service, cPF, cFC, and cPC ranged from 0. 07 to 0. 82 as absolute value. Fertility was unfavorably correlated with production; estimates ranged from âˆ’ 0. 26 (cPC with protein percentage) to 0. 76 (cPC with lactation length), confirming the genetic antagonism between reproductive efficiency and milk production.

Records of BCS measured on a 5 -point scale were preadjusted for year-season and days in milk at scoring, and were considered positive (1) for fat cows if they exceeded the value of 1 residual standard deviation or null (0) otherwise, whereas positive values for thin cows were imputed to records below âˆ’ 1 residual standard deviation. Fertility indicators measured on first- and second-parity cows were interval from parturition to first service, interval from first service to conception, interval from parturition to conception, number of inseminations to conception, conception at first service, and nonreturn rate at 56 d after first service. Production traits were peak milk yield, lactation milk yield, and lactation length. Data were from 1, 413 herds and included 16, 324 records of BCS, fertility, and production for first-parity, and 10, 086 fertility records for second-parity cows. Animals calved from 2002 to 2007 and were progeny of 420 <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>bulls.</b> Genetic parameters for the aforementioned traits were obtained under univariate and bivariate threshold and censored linear sire models implemented in a Bayesian framework. Posterior means of heritabilities for BCS, fat cows, and thin cows were 0. 141, 0. 122, and 0. 115, respectively. Genetic correlations of body condition traits with contemporary production were moderate to high and were between âˆ’ 0. 556 and 0. 623. Body condition score as moderately related to fertility in first (âˆ’ 0. 280 to 0. 497) and second (âˆ’ 0. 392 to 0. 248) lactation. The fat cow trait was scarcely related to fertility, particularly in first-parity cows (âˆ’ 0. 203 to 0. 281).

Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and PROH at a concentration of 6 M were used as cryoprotectant agents (CPAs) to vitrify oocytes at germinal vesicle stage (GV) or in vitro matured oocytes at metaphase II stage (M II). In vitro fertilization rate (cleavage rate and cleavage index) was compared to examine the treatment effect in experiment I. Frozen-thawed semen of four <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> donor <b>bulls</b> was used to compare IVF rate of vitrified-warmed oocytes in experiment II. Overall oocyte surviving after vitrified-warming procedures was 89. 6 %. Cleavage rate and cleavage index of GV stage oocytes vitrified in PROH did not differ (P> 0. 05) from those of fresh oocytes (control). The GV oocytes vitrified in DMSO or M-II oocytes vitrified in PROH and DMSO showed significantly less (P< 0. 05) cleavage rate and cleavage index as compared with fresh oocytes. Therefore, GV stage oocytes vitrified in PROH were further used to check the post-thawed viability of buffalo bull semen on the basis of IVF rate.

The efficiency of such programmes mainly depends on the genetic correlations between sire performances and progeny beef traits. Such correlations were independently estimated, using the multivariate REML (restricted maximum likelihood) method in a Limousin and a Charolais programme. In both breeds, high genetic correlations were observed between sires and progeny analogous morphology scores (from 0. 64 to 0. 82). Genetic correlations estimated between sires and progeny growth (from 0. 41 to 0. 70) were lower {{probably due to the}} difference of diet in central and progeny stations. Correlations between sire muscling scores and progeny skeletal frames (and vice-versa) were negative (from - 0. 05 to - 0. 58). The genetic correlations of sire traits with progeny dressing percentage (DP p) and carcass fatness score (CF p) were only low to moderate. These results show that the selection of bulls at the end of performance testing in test stations may be efficient in improving progeny growth and morphology.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{hypothesis}} that bulls have significant intra-individual differences in the hydraulic conductivity (Lp) and permeability coefficient for glycerol (Ps) of the sperm cell membrane. The permeability parameters were determined at 22, 10, and 0 Â°C of sperm from 7 Holstein Frisian <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> (AI) <b>bulls,</b> using four ejaculates per bull. A stopped-flow approach was applied to provide temporal resolution sufficient to measure rapid cell volume changes under anisosmotic conditions in the absence or presence of glycerol. This technique utilizes a concentration-dependent self-quenching entrapped fluorophore. The resulting cell volume changes were used in three-parameter fitting calculations to compute Lp in the absence glycerol, and Lp in the presence of glycerol (Lpgly) and Ps. Averaged over all bulls, Lp in the absence of glycerol was 0. 28 Â± 0. 01, 0. 15 Â± 0. 01 and 0. 10 Â± 0. 01 Â¿m min- 1 atm- 1 (mean Â± SD) at 22, 10 and 0 Â°C, respectively, yielding an Arrhenius activation energy (Ea) of 7. 39 kcal/mol. The average Lpgly value at 22 Â°C, was 3. 8 times lower than Lp in the absence of glycerol (P < 0. 05). Lpgly, Ps, and the reflection coefficient (Â¿) at 22 Â°C were 0. 073 Â± 0. 015 Â¿m min- 1 atm- 1, 0. 80 Â± 0. 33 Ã— 10 - 3 cm min- 1, and 0. 92 Â± 0. 10 (mean Â± SD), respectively. Subsequent experiments were performed at 10 and 0 Â°C. Activation energies for Lpgly and Ps were 10. 08 and 8. 77 kcal/mol, respectively. The significant differences between individual bulls in Lp and Ps indicate that individual males may require individual adjustments of the cooling protocol. Application of these data in a theoretical model to simulate the osmotic events during freezing resulted in predicted optimal cooling rates in the range of published empirical value...|$|R

50|$|In humans, <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> can be {{used when}} a woman cannot, for any {{of a number of}} reasons, {{conceive}} by natural means. The sperm may be provided by either by a sexual partner of her choice or by a sperm donor. <b>Artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> techniques available include intracervical insemination and intrauterine <b>insemination.</b> <b>Artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> using donor sperm is most commonly employed by lesbian couples, single women. and heterosexual couples when the male partner is suffering from male infertility. Compared with natural <b>insemination,</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> may be more invasive, and it may require professional assistance and medical expertise, which will have a higher cost.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the reproductive performance in swine using two <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> techniques. Were used 60 animals overall, the breed was DB 90 (DanBred) the average of the age was 22 months than weight 210 kg. The experimental delimitation was divided into two groups, which one containing 30 animals, randomly. The first group the animal were inseminated with post-cervical <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> technique, with 1. 5 billons of spermatozoa in 50 ml, and in the second group was executed the intracervical <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> technique, with 3 billons of spermatozoa in 80 ml. The statistic was not parametric analyze (Kruskal-Wallis) and test of de averages by Student-Newman-Keuls (p< 0. 05). The number of return to estrus was 2 in both groups (postcervical <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> vs intracervical <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination),</b> the number of abortions (0 vs 2), the number of farrow (28 vs 26), the farrowing rate (93. 33 % vs 86. 68 %), and the litter size (14. 07 vs 14. 10), respectively. The post-cervical <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination,</b> showed similar results comparing with the intracervical <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination.</b> We conclude that the postcervical technique has several possible advantages for the producer, being possible the reduction of 40 % to 45 % of reproducers on the squad...|$|R
50|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> may employ {{assisted}} reproductive technology, {{sperm donation}} and animal husbandry techniques. <b>Artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> techniques available include intracervical insemination and intrauterine insemination. The beneficiaries of <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> {{are women who}} desire {{to give birth to}} their own child who may be in a lesbian relationship, single women or women who are in a heterosexual relationship but with a male partner who suffers from male infertility. Intracervical insemination (ICI) is the easiest and most common insemination technique and can be used in the home for self-insemination without medical practitioner assistance. Compared with natural insemination (i.e., insemination by sexual intercourse), <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> can be more expensive and more invasive, and may require professional assistance.|$|R
