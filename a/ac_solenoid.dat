40|$|Background. Magnetic {{hyperthermia}} using superparamagnetic nanoparticle (SPNP) agents {{is considered}} a promising biotechnological approach to induce heat shock proteins (HSPs) in a target tissue because it can generate accurately controllable localized heating. Objectives. The main objective {{of this study is}} to demonstrate induction of HSPs in cultured retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) by using engineered Mn 0. 5 Zn 0. 5 Fe 2 O 4 SPNP agents coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) 500. Methods. The Mn 0. 5 Zn 0. 5 Fe 2 O 4 nanoparticles were synthesized using a high temperature thermal decomposition method. The AC heating characteristics of PEG 500 -coated Mn 0. 5 Zn 0. 5 Fe 2 O 4 nanoparticles were investigated using an <b>AC</b> <b>solenoid</b> coil-capacitor system. Results. PEG 500 -coated SPNPs efficiently penetrated into the cytoplasm of RGCs without causing obvious cytological changes and showed stable and well-saturated self-heating temperature rise characteristics. Immunofluorescent staining images showed that AC magnetic hyperthermia successfully induced HSP 72 in RGCs incubated with Mn 0. 5 Zn 0. 5 Fe 2 O 4 nanoparticles. In Western blot analysis, a significant increase in immunoreactivity was observed for RGCs incubated with SPNPs in a fixed AC magnetic field (fappl= 140 [*]kHz and Happl= 140 [*]Oe). Conclusion. Our results demonstrate that the induction of HSP 72 with a magnetic nanofluid hyperthermia could potentially be used as a neuroprotective treatment modality by way of enhancing a natural cytoprotective response...|$|E
40|$|Heat therapies such as {{hyperthermia}} and thermoablation {{are very}} promising approaches {{in the treatment}} of cancer. Compared with available hyperthermia modalities, magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) yields better results in uniform heating of the deeply situated tumors. In this approach, fluid consisting of superparamagnetic particles (magnetic fluid) is delivered to the tumor. An alternating (ac) magnetic field is then used to heat the particles and the corresponding tumor, thereby ablating it. However, {{one of the most serious}} shortcomings of this technique is the unwanted heating of the healthy tissues. This results from the magnetic fluid diffusion from the tumor to the surrounding tissues or from incorrect localization of the fluids in the target tumor area. In this study, the authors demonstrated that by depositing appropriate static (dc) magnetic field gradients on the alternating (ac) magnetic fields, focused heating of the magnetic particles can be achieved. A focused hyperthermia system was implemented by using two types of coils: dc and ac coils. The ac coil generated the alternating magnetic field responsible for the heating of the magnetic particles; the dc coil was used to superimpose a static magnetic field gradient on the alternating magnetic field. In this way, focused heating of the particles was obtained in the regions where the static field was dominated by the alternating magnetic field. In vitro experiments showed that as the magnitude of the dc solenoid currents was increased from 0 to 1. 8 A, the specific absorption rate (SAR) of the superparamagnetic particles 2 cm apart from the <b>ac</b> <b>solenoid</b> center decreased by a factor of 4. 5, while the SAR of the particles at the center was unchanged. This demonstrates that the hyperthermia system is capable of precisely focusing the heat at the center. Additionally, with this approach, shifting of the heat focus can be achieved by applying different amounts of currents to individual dc solenoids. In vivo experiments were performed with adult rats, where magnetic fluids were injected percutaneously into the tails (with homogeneous fluid distribution inside the tails). Histological examination showed that, as we increased the dc solenoid current from 0. 5 to 1. 8 A, the total burned volume decreased from 1. 6 to 0. 2 cm 3 verifying the focusing capability of the system. The authors believe that the studies conducted in this work show that MFH can be a much more effective method with better heat localization and focusing abilities. © 2009 American Association of Physicists in Medicine...|$|E
25|$|All {{solenoids}} and coils used on microprocessor games {{include a}} special reverse-biased diode {{to eliminate a}} high-voltage pulse of reverse EMF (electromotive force). Without this diode, when the solenoid is de-energized, the magnetic field that was built up in the coil collapses and generates a brief, high-voltage pulse backward into the wiring, capable of destroying the solid-state components used to control the solenoid. Proper wiring polarity must be retained during coil replacement or this diode will act as a dead short, immediately destroying electronic switches. Older electromechanical <b>AC</b> game <b>solenoids</b> do not require this diode, since they were controlled with mechanical switches. However, electromechanical games running on DC do require diodes to protect the rectifier.|$|R
25|$|All {{but very}} old games use low DC {{voltages}} {{to power the}} solenoids and electronics (or relays). Some microprocessor games use high voltages (potentially hazardous) for the score displays. Very early games used low-voltage <b>AC</b> power for <b>solenoids,</b> requiring fewer components, but AC is less efficient for powering solenoids, causing heavier wiring and slower performance. For locations that suffer from low AC wall outlet voltage, additional taps may be provided on the AC transformer in electromechanical games to permit raising the game's DC voltage levels, thus strengthening the solenoids. Microprocessor games have electronic power supplies that automatically compensate for inaccurate AC supply voltages.|$|R
40|$|Integrated circuit {{technology}} continually presses toward higher transistor {{density and}} thus smaller dimensions, yet passive components which remain {{the bulk of}} the circuit area, surprisingly receive sideline attention. This work addresses a niche area of inductor design as it applies to the 3 -dimensional (3 -D) integration of active transistors and passive components. Hybrid, 3 -D circuits residing on inexpensive silicon substrates can be fashioned using a photosensitive epoxy known as SU- 8 serving as the interposer layer between the substrate and in which the passive components are embedded. The active components, which are known-good-chips, are secured with epoxy into deep reactive ion etched pockets in the silicon substrate. The inductors are fabricated in the SU- 8 covering the active chips. This technique saves considerable money and increases the yield of 3 -D circuits compared with the high cost of monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs). The design of solenoid inductors was simulated using a Matlab model incorporating closed-form equations. Herein, that model was developed and verified against both empirical data from fabricated solenoids and against data from a physical simulator in CoventorWare 2 ̆ 7 s 3 -D electromagnetic, software. A design of experiments examined the effect of solenoid geometry on inductance, quality factor and <b>AC</b> resistance. Additionally, <b>solenoids</b> were fabricated with ferromagnetic cores in an effort to study the potential of enhancing the inductance and quality factor...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of the experimental trials {{was to investigate the}} influence of the electromagnetic force generated by an <b>AC</b> powered <b>solenoid</b> on ceramic foam filters (CFF) of different filter grades (30, 50 and 80 ppi). The filtering and priming of liquid aluminium alloy (A 356) with the addition of SiC particles based A 356 alloy was investigated. A batch reactor was used to investigate the priming and wetting properties of the CFF&# 180;s. The filtration mechanisms and the ability to remove gas trapped inside and below the filter elements with and without the application of magnetic fields were studied. Each filter grade was studied with three different times, i. e. 3, 6 and 10 minutes. Gravity trials (without electromagnetic field) were performed for each filter grade as a standard reference to industry practice. Industrial standard CFF&# 180;s (Sivex&# 174;) were combined with an electromagnetic field generated by short double coils (solenoids) using a frequency of 50 Hz. The induction heating power input was sufficient to maintain the temperature of the melt. The magnetic field penetrated the entire filter element and generated a force (Lorentz) in the melt, resulting in zones of differential pressure. The pressure gradient caused high velocity recirculation of the melt. Lorentz force calculations were performed analytically and the solutions are verified by COMSOL&# 174; simulations and by experimental observations. The base alloy (A 356) was mixed with 10 % composite material of A 356 base alloy, containing 15 % SiC-particles, sized from 13 to 23 &# 181;m. Experiments with 30 ppi grade filters were performed with a higher amount of particles using a recipe of: 60 % A 356, 20 % anodized and lacquered plates and 20 % composite containing 15 % SiC particles sized from 13 to 23 &# 181;m. The results of these experimental trials show the application of magnetic fields during the filtration process, affecting collection mechanisms and the distribution of SiC particles inside the filter media. Significant improvements of the priming and wetting of the liquid aluminium alloy on the alumina were observed with the application of a magnetic field. Gas bubbles trapped inside and below the filter element were completely removed. Electromagnetic forces were observed to influence the separation of the particles in addition to all of the standard filtration mechanisms. Preheating was not necessary when using electromagnetically enhanced priming of the filter media. The induced velocity strongly increases the throughput of the melt through the finer filter grades. </p...|$|R
