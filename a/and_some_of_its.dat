5|$|A {{subject of}} {{on-going}} {{research is the}} formation of the Moon, some 4.53 Bya. A working hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a Mars-sized object, named Theia, impacted Earth. In this scenario, the mass of Theia was approximately 10% of that of Earth, it impacted Earth with a glancing blow, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> mass merged with Earth. Between approximately 4.1 and , numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon, and by inference, to that of Earth.|$|E
5|$|Head {{injury is}} present in ancient myths that may date back before {{recorded}} history.

The Edwin Smith Papyrus, written around 1650–1550BC, describes various head injuries and symptoms and classifies them based on their presentation and tractability. Ancient Greek physicians including Hippocrates understood the brain {{to be the center of}} thought, probably due to their experience with head trauma.|$|E

There was also evidence of a coverup and falsification of critical maintenance records by LANSA employees during the investigation process. The Peruvian government subsequently fined LANSA <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> employees, and suspended the airline's operating license for 90 days as a consequence.|$|E
5|$|The {{genealogy}} of Ine and of {{the kings}} of Wessex is known from two sources: the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List. The Chronicle {{was created in the}} late 9th century, probably at the court of Alfred the Great, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> annals incorporated short genealogies of kings of Wessex. These are often at variance with the more extensive information in the Regnal List. The inconsistencies appear to result from the efforts of later chroniclers to demonstrate that each king on the list was descended from Cerdic, the founder, according to the Chronicle, of the West Saxon line in England.|$|E
