50|$|An <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> {{is used in}} some {{automobiles}} {{to measure}} the quantity of air going into the internal combustion engine. All modern electronically controlled Diesel Engines use an <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter,</b> {{as it is the}} only possible means of determining the air intake for them. In the case of a petrol engine, the electronic control unit (ECU) then calculates how much fuel is needed to inject into the cylinder ports. In the diesel engine, the ECU meters the fuel through the injectors into the engines cylinders during the compression stroke. <b>Air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> is a special sensor which as been modified now by MEMS technology.|$|E

5000|$|The vane (flap) type <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> (Bosch L-Jetronic {{and early}} Motronic EFI systems or Hitachi) {{actually}} measure air volume, whereas the later [...] "hot wire" [...] and [...] "hot film" [...] air mass meters measure {{the mass of}} <b>air</b> <b>flow.</b>|$|R
50|$|If {{the engine}} is {{naturally}} aspirated, an air temperature sensor {{is located in the}} <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> to work out the air mass. However, if {{the engine is}} turbocharged, an additional charge air temperature sensor is used to monitor the temperature of the inducted air after it has passed through the turbocharger and intercooler, in order to accurately and dynamically calculate the overall air mass.|$|E
50|$|Air {{flow meters}} may fail or wear out. When this happens, engine {{performance}} will often decrease significantly, engine emissions will be greatly increased, and usually the Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) will illuminate. In most countries in Europe, and in {{places in the}} United States where emissions inspections are obligatory, a lit MIL is cause for a vehicle to fail the inspection. Some engines do not idle with an <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> failure.|$|E
50|$|An <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter,</b> is {{a device}} that {{measures}} air flow, i.e. how much air is flowing through a tube. It does not measure {{the volume of the}} air passing through the tube, it measures the mass of air flowing through the device per unit time. Thus air flow meters are simply an application of mass flow meters for a special medium. Typically, mass air flow measurements are expressed in the units of kilograms per second (kg/s).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> monitor <b>air</b> (compressed, forced, or ambient) in many {{manufacturing}} processes. In many industries, preheated air (called [...] "combustion air") {{is added}} to boiler fuel just before fuel ignition to ensure the proper ratio of fuel to air for an efficient flame. Pharmaceutical factories and coal pulverizers use forced air {{as a means to}} force particle movement or ensure a dry atmosphere. <b>Air</b> <b>flow</b> is also monitored in mining and nuclear environments {{to ensure the safety of}} people.|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Navy Public Works Center San Diego (PWCSD) was {{concerned}} about the accuracy of various <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> on steam and compressed air lines serving Naval facilities in San Diego, California. The <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> had experienced various inconsistencies that had not been resolved prior to July 1993. Pacific Northwest Laboratory, Richland, Washington, evaluated the operation of 10 out of 79 steam and compressed <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> at PWCSD. The evaluation was limited to analysis of historical information and review of existing operating procedures. On-site investigation of the <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> was limited to external observations of the flow-sensing equipment and a check of the flow computer program. PNL did not remove installed sensing equipment (i. e., <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> or temperature or pressure sensors) to evaluate existing condition or check calibration. Although many of the <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> errors can be traced to improperly normalized readings and to meters improperly compensated for temperature and pressure, lack of regular maintenance, including proper calibration, was evidenced throughout this study. A strict calibration schedule should be established for all steam and <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> including calibration of the temperature sensor, pressure sensor, and flow turbine. It is recommended that the most crucial <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> (such as the 10 evaluated in this study) be calibrated yearly. The remaining 69 <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> could be placed on a staggered, biyearly calibration schedule. Calibration should be done by qualified personnel only. Improper calibration is often worse than no calibration at all. An outside firm is recommended to be contracted with to perform all maintenance and calibration on <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> at the Naval facilities. Use of an outside firm would better facilitate regular, reliable calibration while removing liability for damaged parts...|$|R

40|$|Optical <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> {{measurements}} {{can support}} {{the testing of}} aircraft and can be instrumental to in-flight investigations of the atmosphere or atmospheric phenomena. Furthermore, optical <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> potentially contribute as avionics systems to flight safety and as air data systems. The qualification of these instruments for the flight environment is where we encounter the systems in flight testing. An overview is presented of different optical <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> measurement techniques applied in flight {{and what can be}} achieved with the techniques for flight test purposes is reviewed. All in-flight optical airflow velocity measurements use light scattering. Light is scattered on both air molecules and aerosols entrained in the air. Basic principles of making optical measurements in flight, some basic optical concepts, electronic concepts, optoelectronic interfaces, and some atmospheric processes associated with natural aerosols are reviewed. Safety aspects in applying the technique are shortly addressed. The different applications of the technique are listed and some typical examples are presented.

40|$|Heat {{and mass}} {{transfer}} by nafion gas humidifiers The present research {{aim is to}} investigate {{the performance of a}} PermaPure humidifier (PPH) device, that is able to transfer heat and moisture from the PEM fuel cell cathode exhaust to the inlet air stream and is similar to an air/air shell tube counter current flow heat exchanger, with 1660, 0. 345 m long, tubes. The experimental apparatus consists essentially of two variable speed air compressors, a temperature controlled large water tank, in order to get saturated the primary line air, and the humidifier to be tested; in the secondary air line the gas flows from the compressor to the PPH tubes, increasing its humidity along its path. The instrumentation consists of two <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> four hygrometers for the measurements of either the relative humidity or the temperature, several chromel-alumel thermocouples and pressure transducers to measure the ambient and loop temperature and pressure and pressure drop across the PPH shell and tube sides. The experimental results, obtained within a wide range of <b>air</b> temperature, <b>flow</b> rate and inlet humidity, of the same order of the real fuel cell parameters, are reported in order to investigate the water vapour transfer from a moisture saturated air stream to a dry and cold air stream. The direct transport of vapour is from shell to tube-side flow. Data are discussed on the ground of models that have been presented recently and a simplified model is also presented, to predict the outlet PPH conditions for different inlet conditions; the test data comparison with the prediction seems fairly goo...|$|R
5000|$|The {{injected}} 2.0 L {{used the}} Ford EEC-IV {{engine control system}} which brought the output up to [...] of power and 160 Nm of torque, although much of this increased performance {{can be attributed to}} the improved design of the EFI variants cylinder head. As the EEC-IV installation on most of those engines contains some Bosch parts that are easily visible in the engine compartment (<b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> of the electromechanical [...] "flap" [...] type, injectors, fuel pressure regulator etc), it is often - but falsely believed that they are fitted with the Bosch L-jetronic injection system.Some of the TL20EFI engines have closed-loop lambda control, while others are lacking that feature.|$|E
50|$|The active {{valve control}} system (AVCS) is an {{automobile}} {{variable valve timing}} technology used by Subaru. It varies {{the timing of the}} intake valves by using hydraulic oil pressure to rotate the camshaft in order to provide optimal air flow {{in and out of the}} engine. The system is closed loop using camshaft sensors, crankshaft sensors, <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter,</b> throttle position as well as oxygen sensors and/or Air-Fuel ratio sensors in order to calculate engine load. The ECU is programmed to operate control valves that adjust the delivery of the hydraulic pressure in order to move the camshaft into the position that will provide the engine with the best performance while minding emissions standards.|$|E
50|$|When an {{internal}} combustion engine is under high load (e.g. wide open throttle), {{the output of the}} oxygen sensor is ignored, and the ECU automatically enriches the mixture to protect the engine, as misfires under load {{are much more likely to}} cause damage. This is referred to as an engine running in 'open-loop mode'. Any changes in the sensor output will be ignored in this state. In many cars (with the exception of some turbocharged models), inputs from the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> are also ignored, as they might otherwise lower engine performance due to the mixture being too rich or too lean, and increase the risk of engine damage due to detonation if the mixture is too lean.|$|E
25|$|A second method called 'continuous blending' is now gaining favor. Oxygen, helium and air are blended on {{the intake}} {{side of a}} compressor. The oxygen and helium are fed into the <b>air</b> stream using <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> so as to achieve the rough mix. The low {{pressure}} mixture is analyzed for oxygen content and the oxygen and helium flows adjusted accordingly. On the high pressure side of the compressor a regulator is used to reduce pressure of a sample flow and the trimix is analyzed (preferably for both helium and oxygen) so that the fine adjustment to the intake gas flows can be made.|$|R
50|$|The {{invention}} of {{programmable logic controllers}} (PLC) allowed gas meter repair facilities to automate most of the manual bell prover's process and calculations. Instead of manually raising and lowering the bell prover, solenoid valves connected to a PLC control <b>air</b> <b>flows</b> through the <b>meter.</b> Temperature, pressure, and humidity sensors {{can be used to}} feed data into an automated bell PLC, and calculations for meter proofs can be handled by a computer or electronic device programmed for such a purpose. In the early 1990s, the PLC was replaced by PACs (Programmable Automated Controls) and modern computer systems. Sensors to read the index of a meter were added to further automate the process, removing much of the human error associated with manual bell provers.|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this program}} were to study the factors leading to increased errors in sub-critical <b>flow</b> <b>metering,</b> utilize existing theoretical methods to design a new sub-critical <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> for very high accuracy, predict its discharge coefficient, and then experimentally verify it by calibration with an industry standard critical <b>flow</b> <b>meter.</b> The meter design was typical of that used for modern, lightweight, engine mounted bellmouths, but its size was small enough to allow its calibration in a high accuracy laboratory environment. Thus this program provides a "calibration" of the theoretical method and establishes the link between a traceable metering standard and large engine bellmouths whose <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates exceed the capacity {{of any of the}} worlds calibration facilities...|$|R
50|$|Fuel {{is pumped}} from the tank {{to a large}} control valve called a fuel {{distributor}}, which divides the single fuel supply line from the tank into smaller lines, one for each injector. The fuel distributor is mounted atop a control vane through which all intake air must pass, and the system works by varying fuel volume supplied to the injectors based on {{the angle of the}} air vane in the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter,</b> which in turn is determined by the volume of air passing the vane, and by the control pressure. The control pressure is regulated with a mechanical device called the control pressure regulator (CPR) or the warm-up regulator (WUR). Depending on the model, the CPR may be used to compensate for altitude, full load, and/or a cold engine. The injectors are simple spring-loaded check valves with nozzles; once fuel system pressure becomes high enough to overcome the counterspring, the injectors begin spraying.|$|E
50|$|The first-generation Toyota CT26 {{utilized}} {{a single}} entry turbine housing {{and a single}} wastegate port design. It was fitted to the first generation ST165 Toyota Celica GT-Four. The intake charge was cooled by a water-to-air intercooler and the intake manifold design is Toyota's T-VIS. It has 8 independent ports and benefits from the inertia build up to improve engine torque at low and medium speeds by closing 4 ports below a certain RPM and throttle position to increase air speed and maximize fuel atomization and opening all 8 at higher engine loads for better air volume. Air metering is through an <b>Air</b> <b>Flow</b> <b>Meter</b> {{and there is no}} factory BPV/BOV in this generation. Fuel delivery is through 430cc injectors while air is fed through a 55mm throttle body and 7.15mm intake and exhaust valve lift. Compression ratio is 8.5:1 and produces 182-190HP and 190 lb-ft with a factory 8-9psi of boost. Fuel cut is at 12psi.|$|E
50|$|Variometers {{measure the}} rate of change of {{altitude}} by detecting the change in air pressure (static pressure) as altitude changes. A simple variometer can be constructed by adding a large reservoir (a thermos bottle) to augment the storage capacity of a common aircraft rate-of-climb instrument. In its simplest electronic form, the instrument consists of an air bottle connected to the external atmosphere through a sensitive <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter.</b> As the aircraft changes altitude, the atmospheric pressure outside the aircraft changes and air flows into or out of the air bottle to equalise the pressure inside the bottle and outside the aircraft. The rate and direction of flowing air is measured by the cooling of one of two self-heating thermistors and the difference between the thermistor resistances will cause a voltage difference; this is amplified and displayed to the pilot. The faster the aircraft is ascending (or descending), the faster the air flows. Air flowing out of the bottle indicates that the altitude of the aircraft is increasing. Air flowing into the bottle indicates that the aircraft is descending.|$|E

40|$|This paper compares a {{tracer gas}} and a heat balance method to {{calculate}} the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> provided by single-sided ventilation. Carbon dioxide {{is used as a}} tracer gas. The goal is {{to calculate the}} <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> in transient conditions. Simulated pupil dummies in a full scale classroom test facility at the Fraunhofer Institute for Building Physics emit carbon dioxide and heat. Due to mass <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> the tracer gas emission is supposed to be better known than the heat emission. Thus, tracer gas measurement gives more accurate results when the concentration difference between inside and outside air is sufficient.

40|$|The {{performance}} of Wright peak <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> is described using an absolute and precise calibration method. This showed errors {{as great as}} 25 % with the peak <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> and 40 % with the mini peak <b>flow</b> <b>meter.</b> At large <b>flow</b> rates errors were less. The expected variation between individual peak <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> was about 12 %. The expected variation between individual mini peak <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> was between 16 % and 22 %, depending on flow rate. In both its original (Wright and McKcrrow, 1959) and restyled form the Wright peak <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> (p. fjn.) is widely accepted for measurement of peak expira-tory flow rate. Recently a smaller, lowermost device, the mini p. f. m., has been introduced (Wright, 1978). Two calibration methods {{have been used to}} check the various designs of p. f. m. Steady <b>air</b> <b>flows</b> have been blown through a <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> connected in series with the meter. This method does not test the response of the p i jn. to non-steady airflows. Also, it depends on a <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> which cannot readily be checked for its absolute precision. The other method compares readings from the meter with those obtained from a pneumotachograph for a single group of people. This presupposes the pneumotachograph to be properly calibrated. More important, it is imprecise because subjects do not always produce the same peak flow. In a recent report (Perks et al., 1979) the scatter of results was considerable, par-ticularly at low flows. Because of these deficiencies, we developed a calibration procedure which can be cross-checked independently. We report our findings for the three types of Wright p. f. m. : the original p. f. m., the restyled p. f. m. and the mini p. f. m.

5000|$|The RB25 {{series of}} engines was first {{introduced}} in the GTS-25 R32 Nissan Skyline. RB25DE and DET engines produced from August 1993 also featured NVCS (Nissan Variable Cam System) for the intake cam. This gave the new RB25DE more power and torque at lower rpm than the previous model. From 1995,(Series 2 Engines) both the RB25DE and RB25DET had a revised electrical system and the turbocharger on the RB25DET(S2) had a ceramic compressor wheel rather than aluminium. The most obvious change to the system was the introduction of ignition coils with built in ignitors, therefore the coil ignitor that was on previous models was not used. Other changes were, different <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter,</b> engine ECU, cam angle sensor and throttle position sensor. Mechanically Series 1 and Series 2 are very similar, the only mechanical difference would be the camshafts as the Series 2 Cam Angle Sensor's shaft {{that goes into the}} exhaust cam is slightly different. This is very important not to mistake. (early Series 2 featured the traditional Mitsubishi CAS which was later swapped for the Black CAS because of a positioning tooth which occasionally broke off) ...|$|E
50|$|The second-generation Toyota CT26 used a twin entry {{turbine housing}} with dual {{wastegate}} ports. It was fitted {{to the second}} generation ST185 Toyota Celica GT-Four {{as well as the}} SW20 MR2 Turbo. The intake charge is cooled by an air-to-air intercooler either top-mounted in the Celica or side-mounted in the MR2. The rally homologation Celica (known as Group A Rallye in Australia, RC in Japan and Carlos Sainz Limited Edition in Europe) used a top-mounted water-to-air intercooler and is distinguished by a hood vent rather than a hood scoop as found in the non-homologation ST185s. This generation retains the T-VIS intake manifold and the <b>Air</b> <b>Flow</b> <b>Meter.</b> A factory BPV is included in the SW20 MR2 Turbo but not on the Celicas. Compression ratio is 8.8:1 and produces 200-232HP and 200-224 lb-ft. This generation retains the injector size and throttle body size from the previous generation. However, boost is increased to 10-11psi in the ST185 and MR2 while it is increased to 16psi in the ST185RC. Intake and exhaust valve lift is significantly increased to 8.2mm. This generation also is known for the infamous Hose from Hell (HFH) and Hose from Hell on Earth (HFHOE) as two small coolant hoses are known to require replacement sometime after 100k miles and is sandwiched in all directions by components.|$|E
50|$|The third-generation engine {{uses the}} (enthusiast-dubbed) Toyota CT20b turbo, which {{was of the}} same design as the second-generation but with a {{slightly}} improved turbine housing and larger compressor wheel. A factory BPV is installed on all applications. The intake charge is cooled by a water-to-air top-mounted intercooler similar in shape to the ST185RC WTA. One {{can tell the difference}} as the ST205 WTA is black while the ST185 WTA is silver with a black centre. This generation does away with T-VIS and uses a normal 4 runner intake with the same port shape and size as the NA engine (but with larger injector holes for side feed). The <b>Air</b> <b>Flow</b> <b>Meter</b> is also removed in favor of a MAP sensing system (prior generations used a MAP sensor only for the purpose of the factory boost gauge and determining overboost fuel cut). Various increases included injector size (540cc), boost (13psi), overboost fuel cut limit (18psi), intake cam lift (8.7mm), throttle body size (60mm), and a 10mm increase in exhaust ports. Exhaust valve lift is retained at 8.2mm. In late 1997, the block casting was revised with added support around the head to prevent block cracking problems. The CT20b turbo found in this generation is backwards compatible with the second generation motors, however not the first generation. Further improvements include a factory oil catch can. Compression is reduced down to 8.5:1 however power is improved to 245-255PS(242-251HP) and 304 N·m (224 lb-ft).|$|E
