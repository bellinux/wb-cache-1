5|$|On release Iridion {{garnered}} generally poor reviews. The {{graphics and}} sound were generally praised; {{even a year}} after its release, critics at TechTV considered it the best-looking game on the platform. In contrast, critics derided the game's repetitive <b>and</b> <b>frustrating</b> gameplay. Despite lukewarm reception to the title upon release, Iridion 3D influenced future Shin'en shooters such as Iridion II and Nanostray.|$|E
5|$|Dawn of Mana was designed, directed, and {{produced}} by series creator Koichi Ishii. The script {{was written by}} Ryo Akagi, based on a story created by Masato Kato, and the music was composed by a group led by Kenji Ito. The game was a moderate commercial success: it sold 229,000 copies in its first ten days of release in Japan, and over 410,000 copies worldwide {{by the end of}} 2008. While critics praised the graphics and music as beautiful and lush, they found the leveling system annoying, the combat controls difficult <b>and</b> <b>frustrating,</b> and the story trite.|$|E

5|$|Shearer {{suffered}} an injury-hit <b>and</b> <b>frustrating</b> {{season in the}} 2000–01 season, having retired from international football after the UEFA Euro 2000 tournament to focus on club football. He managed only fivegoals in 19games in the league. The 2001–02 season was much better though; Shearer bagged 23goals in 37 league games as Newcastle finished fourth — their highest standing since 1997 — meaning they would qualify for the following season's Champions League competition. One {{of the most memorable}} incidents of the season saw Roy Keane sent off after a confrontation with Shearer during Newcastle's 4–3 win over the Red Devils in September 2001. Shearer also saw red {{for the second time in}} his career this season, after allegedly elbowing an opposition player in a match against Charlton Athletic. The card was subsequently rescinded by referee Andy D'Urso after reviewing video replays after the game.|$|E
5|$|The plugs-out test {{began on}} the morning of January 27, 1967, and {{immediately}} was plagued with problems. First the crew noticed a strange odor in their spacesuits, which delayed the sealing of the hatch. Then, communications problems frustrated the astronauts and forced a hold in the simulated countdown. During this hold, an electrical fire began in the cabin, and spread quickly in the high pressure, 100% oxygen atmosphere. Pressure rose high enough from the fire that the cabin inner wall burst, allowing the fire to erupt onto the pad area <b>and</b> <b>frustrating</b> attempts to rescue the crew. The astronauts were asphyxiated before the hatch could be opened.|$|E

25|$|Day 2 {{was a long}} <b>and</b> <b>frustrating</b> one for England, {{who were}} only able to take two wickets. Jayawardene and the {{recalled}} Dilshan batted for almost two sessions, before Dilshan was run out for 84 trying to give his captain the single that would earn him his century. England’s only positive moment of the day occurring during the same over, where Ravi Bopara picked up his first test wicket when Prasanna Jayawardene edged the ball through to the keeper.

In reply, William Weston and Matt Windows paired up for 106 runs for the second wicket, and not even Chris Tremlett, who took three for 34, could stop Gloucestershire from {{reaching}} the target with more than ten overs to spare.|$|E
25|$|The first {{business}} model that dissuades illegal file sharing {{is to make}} downloading digital media easy and cheap. The use of noncommercial sites makes downloading digital media complex. For example, misspelling an artist's name in a search query will often fail to return a result, and some sites limit internet traffic, which can make downloading media a long <b>and</b> <b>frustrating</b> process. Furthermore, some illegal file sharing websites are host to viruses and malware which attach themselves to the files (see torrent poisoning).If digital media (for example, songs) are all provided on accessible, legitimate sites, and are reasonably priced, consumers will purchase media legally to overcome these frustrations.|$|E

As they are leaving the planet, Trillian is captured by Vogons. The others travel to rescue her from the Vogon home world bureaucracy, facing long lines <b>and</b> <b>frustrating</b> form processing.

25|$|There was a {{sense of}} {{achievement}} when the agreement was finally signed and technicians employed by the CDF got down to the task of making the mechanism operational. In an interview, CDF Chief Executive Officer Ambassador Lorne McDonnough said “The CDF start-up team was always confident it would meet the projected launch date....” Despite this confidence he admitted that “...along the way there were always the glitches <b>and</b> <b>frustrating</b> delays that called for an extra dose of perseverance as well as the need to step back and revisit the problem with a fresh resolve”. Ambassador McDonnough noted that heightened expectations and the desire to see the CDF operational in the shortest possible time, meant that Member States sometimes underestimated the work which had to be done to make the CDF ready for full operations.|$|E
25|$|In 1785, after Foscarini died, Casanova {{began searching}} for another position. A few months later, {{he became the}} {{librarian}} to Count Joseph Karl von Waldstein, a chamberlain of the emperor, in the Castle of Dux, Bohemia (now in the Czech Republic). The Count—himself a Freemason, cabalist, and frequent traveler—had taken to Casanova when they had met a year earlier at Foscarini's residence. Although the job offered security and good pay, Casanova describes his last years as boring <b>and</b> <b>frustrating,</b> {{even though it was}} the most productive time for writing. His health had deteriorated dramatically, and he found life among peasants to be less than stimulating. He was only able to make occasional visits to Vienna and Dresden for relief. Although Casanova got on well with the Count, his employer was a much younger man with his own eccentricities. The Count often ignored him at meals and failed to introduce him to important visiting guests. Moreover, Casanova, the testy outsider, was thoroughly disliked by most of the other inhabitants of the Castle of Dux. Casanova's only friends seemed to be his fox terriers. In despair, Casanova considered suicide, but instead decided that he must live on to record his memoirs, which he did until his death.|$|E
