5|$|During Oblivions development, Bethesda {{concentrated}} on creating {{a system with}} a more realistic storyline, believable characters, <b>and</b> <b>meaningful</b> quests than had {{been done in the}} past. In comparison with previous titles in the series, the game features improved artificial intelligence thanks to the use of Bethesda proprietary Radiant A.I. software, and enhanced physics facilitated by the Havok physics engine. The graphics take advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines such as high dynamic range rendering (HDR) and specular mapping. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the building of Oblivions terrain, leading to the expedited creation of landscapes that are more complex and realistic than in past titles.|$|E
5|$|The {{flagship}} programme develops students' {{interest in learning}} about eastern and western cultures by providing them with opportunities to integrate both cultures and to be immersed in other cultures, and to have in-depth understanding of the essence of both {{the east and the}} west, thus preparing students to become inclusive talents who are effectively bilingual and able to make strong <b>and</b> <b>meaningful</b> connections with the world. The four-year {{flagship programme}} is mainly made up of two segments, namely 'Broad-Base Curriculum' and 'Peaks of Excellence', which include cultural intelligence and life education to groom students to be world-ready.|$|E
5|$|Jaruzelski's Poland {{depended}} on low-cost deliveries of industrial staple commodities from the Soviet Union <b>and</b> <b>meaningful</b> Polish reforms, economic or political, were not feasible during {{the rule of}} the last three conservative Soviet general secretaries. The perestroika and glasnost policies of the Soviet Union's new leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, were therefore a crucial factor in stimulating reform in Poland. Gorbachev essentially repudiated the Brezhnev Doctrine, which had stipulated that attempts by its Eastern European satellite states to abandon the communist bloc would be countered by the Soviet Union with force. The developments in the Soviet Union altered the international situation and provided a historical opportunity for independent reforms in Poland. The hardline stance of US President Ronald Reagan was also helpful. David Ost stressed the constructive influence of Gorbachev. With his support for Polish and Hungarian membership in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and for the East European pluralistic evolution in general, the Soviet leader effectively pushed East Europe toward the West.|$|E

5|$|Rocksteady {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} a sequel before development of Arkham Asylum had concluded, developing ideas for both the story and setting so the games' narratives could be effectively connected; a secret room was hidden in the asylum warden's office in Arkham Asylum containing hints of how the sequel would progress, including blueprints for the Arkham City prison; the blueprints are quite similar to its final layout in Arkham City. The original idea was to take the game out of the asylum setting and onto the streets of Gotham City while retaining the level of design detail put into the asylum. To that end they wanted to include locations from the Batman mythos that were notable <b>and</b> <b>meaningful</b> to the character, instead of a series of generic streets; Rocksteady was initially unsure how technical considerations would limit the scope of this idea.|$|E

25|$|According to some {{lines of}} thinking, the ageing process is routed into a basic {{reduction}} of biological complexity, and thus loss of information. In order {{to reverse this}} loss, gerontologist Marios Kyriazis suggested {{that it is necessary}} to increase input of actionable <b>and</b> <b>meaningful</b> information both individually (into individual brains), and collectively (into societal systems). This technique enhances overall biological function through up-regulation of immune, hormonal, antioxidant and other parameters, resulting in improved age-repair mechanisms. Working in parallel with natural evolutionary mechanisms that can facilitate survival through increased fitness, Kyriazis claims that the technique may lead to a reduction of the rate of death as a function of age, i.e. indefinite lifespan.|$|E
25|$|The {{style in}} which Bouguereau chooses {{to paint the}} {{children}} is articulated <b>and</b> <b>meaningful.</b> Their white flesh is luminous and rosy- a symbol to their purity. Wings sprout delicately from their shoulders. Bouguereau invokes whimsical elements of childhood and young love {{through the use of}} pastels and soft, velvety brushstrokes. The painting is mostly blue, an uncommon color for the portrayal of a love story. By not using pink and reds, the painter steers away from the theme of forbidden love and towards the idea of young love. The colors are cool and crisp. Bouguereau takes care to accurately portray the pudginess of Cupid and Psyche. The painting is full of texture from the light fabrics, wispy golden hair, and smoothness of their skin. The painting doesn’t strike the viewer but is a rest for the eyes.|$|E
25|$|Political {{activism}} by youth can {{go unnoticed}} because youth activism often occurs on school grounds {{and away from}} the adult society, but youth often face resistance when forming youth activist groups in schools. As the central beneficiaries of public schools, youth are also advocating for student-led school change and education reform through student activism <b>and</b> <b>meaningful</b> student involvement. There are structural inequalities that keep youth from engaging in political talk and action on school grounds or the public domain. School clubs require an adult adviser to make the club official, further adding to school hierarchies of adult power. While some youth participate in student government, others prefer student unions because they provide a real voice to the students and present it to the administration while student governments do not have the power to effect real change in a school system.|$|E
40|$|EXPLORING IDENTITY THROUGH SELF-PORTRAITURE by ROSE M BARRON Under the Direction of Dr Melody Milbrandt ABSTRACT 1) Statement of the problem: How can art {{education}} help students deconstruct stereotypical imagery <b>and</b> develop <b>meaningful</b> artwork?

Student’s artworks, reflections and responses were analyzed. 3) Conclusions: Art lessons can help students construct positive identity and develop positive imagery. Art lessons can help students deconstruct negative stereotypical imagery <b>and</b> develop <b>meaningful</b> imagery.

25|$|As for the reparations, the Chamber ordered Republika Srpska to {{disclose}} any information it {{had on the}} fate of the applicants relatives; to release any missing persons it had in custody; to conduct a full <b>and</b> <b>meaningful</b> investigation of the role of its authorities and armed forces in the Srebrenica massacre, its efforts to cover up the crime, and the fate of the missing persons, and to publish this report within six months of the decision; to publish the decision of the Chamber in the Serbian language in its Official Gazette; and to make a total donation of 4.000.000 Convertible Marks to the Srebrenica Genocide memorial. Following the decision the Srebrenica Commission was formed by the Republika Srpska government to investigate the events that occurred in and around Srebrenica in July 1995. It has been argued that even though the overall impact of the Commission was limited, its formation and work did present a first step for Republika Srpska in recognition of the genocide.|$|E
25|$|Recall {{memory is}} linked with {{instincts}} and mechanisms {{in order to}} remember how an event happened to learn from it or avoid the agitator, connections are made with emotions. For instance, if a speaker is very calm and neutral, the effectiveness of encoding memory is very low and listeners get the gist of what the speaker is discussing. On the other hand, if a speaker is shouting and/or using emotionally driven words, listeners tend to remember key phrases {{and the meaning of}} the speech. This is full access of the fight or flight mechanism all people have functioning in the brain, but based on what triggers this mechanism will lead to better recall of it. People tend to focus their attention on cues that are loud, very soft, or something unusual. This makes the auditory system pick up the differences in regular speaking <b>and</b> <b>meaningful</b> speech, when something significant is spoken in the discussion people home in on the message at that part of the speech but tend to lose {{the other part of the}} discussion. Our brains sense differences in speech and when those differences occur the brain encodes that part of speech into memory and the information can be recalled for future reference.|$|E
