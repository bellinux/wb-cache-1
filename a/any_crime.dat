5|$|Burton was {{the first}} {{defendant}} convicted under § 1782 of the Revised Statutes, 40 years after its 1864 enactment. Burton and his supporters argued that he was selectively prosecuted, on the orders of President Theodore Roosevelt, for political reasons. Burton also became {{the first member of}} the United States Senate to be convicted of public corruption, in fact the first member of the Senate to be convicted of <b>any</b> <b>crime.</b> The next year, Senator John H. Mitchell (R-OR) was convicted under the same statute {{for his role in the}} Oregon land fraud scandal.|$|E

5|$|Drysdale also {{oversaw the}} first civil {{litigation}} trial, {{in which the}} owners of the two ships sought damages from each other. His decision (27 April 1918) found Mont-Blanc entirely at fault. Subsequent appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada (19 May 1919), and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London (22 March 1920), determined Mont-Blanc and Imo were equally to blame for navigational errors that led to the collision. No party was ever convicted for <b>any</b> <b>crime</b> or otherwise successfully prosecuted for any actions that precipitated the disaster.|$|E
5|$|He {{has never}} been charged with <b>any</b> <b>crime</b> due to {{apparent}} mental inculpability. One contentious issue of Weston's incarceration is that of forced medication. Weston has thus far refused to take any medications voluntarily. His lawyers helped enable this, {{in order to protect}} him from the death penalty. In May 2001, a federal judge authorized doctors to treat Weston involuntarily. A panel from a federal appeals court ruled in July 2001 that Weston could be forced to take the drugs which he was forced to do for 120 days. He remains in the Butner facility indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{continued}} to succeed {{upon entering the}} NFL in 1950, winning the championship that year and reaching the title game in both 1951 and 1952. In January 1951, McBride testified in nationally televised hearings before the Kefauver Committee, where he was questioned about his Continental Press Service and alleged ties to organized crime and illegal gambling. It emerged that McBride partnered with Cleveland police captain John Fleming in real estate deals and had Fleming on the Yellow Cab payroll until 1941. McBride denied the mafia connections, claimed he never broke the law and was never charged with <b>any</b> <b>crime.</b> Congress later passed legislation making such wire services illegal.|$|E

5|$|Use of {{insanity}} {{as a concept}} dates from 1324, and its criminal application was used until the late 16th century in an almost identical way. The defence, if successful, either allowed the defendant to return home or led to him being incarcerated until he was granted a royal pardon; after 1542, a defendant who became insane prior to the trial could not be tried for <b>any</b> <b>crime,</b> {{up to and including}} high treason. During the 18th century the test to determine insanity became extremely narrow, with defendants required to prove that they could not distinguish between good and evil and that they suffered from a mental disease which made them incapable of understanding the consequences of their actions. The current wording comes from the M'Naghten Rules, based on the trial of Daniel M'Naghten in 1843.|$|E
5|$|On August 11, 1999, President Bill Clinton offered {{conditional}} clemency to sixteen {{members of}} the FALN convicted for conspiracy to commit robbery, conspiracy to bomb-making, and sedition, {{as well as for}} firearms and explosives violations. None of the sixteen were convicted of bombings or <b>any</b> <b>crime</b> which injured another person, and all of the sixteen had served nineteen years or longer in prison, which was a longer sentence than such crimes typically received, according to the White House. Clinton offered clemency, on condition that the prisoners renounce violence, at the appeal of 10 Nobel Peace Prize laureates, President Jimmy Carter, the Archbishop of New York, and the Archbishop of Puerto Rico. The commutation was opposed by U.S. Attorney's Office, the FBI, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons and criticised by many including former victims of FALN terrorist activities, the Fraternal Order of Police, and members of Congress. Hillary Clinton in her campaign for Senator also criticised the commutation, although she had earlier been supportive.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} in this hearing was Oppenheimer's earliest testimony about George Eltenton's approach to various Los Alamos scientists, a story that Oppenheimer confessed he had fabricated to protect his friend Haakon Chevalier. Unknown to Oppenheimer, both versions were recorded during his interrogations of a decade before. He was surprised {{on the witness stand}} with transcripts of these, which he had not been given a chance to review. In fact, Oppenheimer had never told Chevalier that he had finally named him, and the testimony had cost Chevalier his job. Both Chevalier and Eltenton confirmed mentioning that they had a way to get information to the Soviets, Eltenton admitting he said this to Chevalier and Chevalier admitting he mentioned it to Oppenheimer, but both put the matter in terms of gossip and denied any thought or suggestion of treason or thoughts of espionage, either in planning or in deed. Neither was ever convicted of <b>any</b> <b>crime.</b>|$|E

25|$|Labor spies may be {{referred}} to as spies, operatives, agents, agents provocateurs, saboteurs, infiltrators, informants, spotters, plants, special police, or detectives.

While detectives investigate people suspected of crimes, the labor spy shadows and spies upon people who are not suspected of having committed <b>any</b> <b>crime,</b> nor are they suspected of planning <b>any</b> <b>crime.</b> During the mid-to-late-19th century, a period during which there was intense distaste for the detective profession, the Pinkerton and Thiel detective agencies referred to their field agents as operatives or testers.
