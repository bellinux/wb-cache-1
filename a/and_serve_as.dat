5|$|An unusual type of {{predator}} deterrence {{is observed}} in the Malaysian exploding ant. Social hymenoptera rely on altruism to protect the entire colony, so the self-destructive acts benefit all individuals in the colony. When a worker ant's leg is grasped, it suicidally expels the contents of its hypertrophied submandibular glands, expelling corrosive irritant compounds and adhesives onto the predator. These prevent predation <b>and</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> a signal to other enemy ants to stop predation {{of the rest of}} the colony.|$|E

5|$|Two of its subunits, the Actin-Related Proteins ARP2 and ARP3 closely {{resemble}} {{the structure of}} monomeric actin <b>and</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> nucleation sites for new actin filaments.

Branched actin networks are created {{as a result of this}} nucleation of new filaments. The regulation of rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton is important for processes like cell locomotion, phagocytosis, and intracellular motility of lipid vesicles.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} {{enemy is}} the Flood, a parasitic alien life form {{that appears in}} three main variants. Infection Forms, the true form of the Flood, are fragile beings and do little damage individually, but often travel in swarms of several dozen in order to infect their prey.
