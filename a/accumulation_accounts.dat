We further estimated an annual CO 2 budget for each lake that incorporates the fluxes resulting from winter ice-cover and summer hypolimnetic CO 2 accumulation to assess their relative importance. The volumetric rates of CO 2 accumulation during the winter ice cover ranged from 4. 1 to 42. 1 mg C m− 3 d− 1, and from 9. 3 to 54. 5 mg C m− 3 d− 1 in the summer hypolimnion, and both varied mainly {{as a function of}} water temperature. The total CO 2 accumulation at the end of winter/summer was most strongly related to lake mean depth and was significantly greater under ice than in the hypolimnion. This greater CO 2 accumulation resulted in relatively high and unvarying spring outflux, averaging 404 mg C m− 2 d− 1 (C. V. 27 %). Significant hypolimnetic CO 2 accumulation also resulted in relatively high fluxes (average 228 mg C m− 2 d− 1) during autumnal mixing, which were more variable (C. V. 43 %) than spring fluxes. Average fluxes were lowest and most variable in summer (198 mg C m− 2 d− 1, C. V. 46 %). The net annual CO 2 flux ranged from 14 to 68 g C m− 2 y− 1, and was positively related to DOC concentration.

Previous studies are extended by including schooling investments of both time and goods within the school year, a human capital externality, and imperfect substitution between white collar and manual tasks. The model of worker productivity used to conduct the growth accounting is consistent with (1) rates of return to time and goods investment in education, (2) white collar wage premia, and (3) trendless worker productivity growth rates in the United States over the 20 th century. The analysis suggests that about one third of United States growth over this period was related to human capital <b>accumulation,</b> <b>accounting</b> for an average annual growth rate of 0. 6 to 0. 7 percent.

40|$|Models of {{decision}} making differ in how they treat early evidence as it recedes in time. Standard models, such as the drift diffusion model, assume that evidence is gradually accumulated until it reaches a boundary and a decision is initiated. One recent model, the urgency gating model, has proposed that decision making {{does not require the}} accumulation of evidence at all. Instead, accumulation could be replaced by a simple urgency factor that scales with time. To distinguish between these fundamentally different accounts {{of decision}} making, we performed an experiment in which we manipulated the presence, duration, and valence of early evidence. We simulated the associated response time and error rate predictions from the drift diffusion model and the urgency gating model, fitting the models to the empirical data.

Previous neuroimaging studies of perceptual decision making have identified activity related to accumulation in parietal, inferior temporal, and frontal regions.

This result supports a framework in which evidence is processed in sensory cortex and integrated over time in higher order cortical areas.

Under channel decomposition, the determinants could affect economic growth through physical capital accumulation, through human capital acquisition, and/or through growth in total factor productivity. Thus, by examining the outcomes of the decomposition, we can test alternative models, as different models often imply different channels of operation for the determinants. Methodologically, channel decomposition combines growth accounting with regression analysis, rather than regarding them as alternative approaches. With this method, {{it becomes clear that}} technological catch-up, not factor <b>accumulation,</b> <b>accounts</b> for the widely documented phenomenon of conditional convergence.

I propose a structural model that unifies those events through the role of education: the key feature is that parental education determines simultaneously fertility, mortality and children's education, so that the accumulation of education {{from one generation to}} another explains both fast growth and the reduction of fertility and mortality rates. Using original data, the model is estimated and fits in a remarkable way income, the distribution of education and age pyramids. Moreover, some historical data on Blacks, assumed to constitute the bottom of the distribution of education, show that the model predicts correctly the joint distribution of fertility and education, and that of mortality and education. Comparisons with the PSID suggest that the intergenerational correlation of income is also well captured.

The major observation leading to this interpretation was that a Na+ influx failed to reproduce the large and rapid cell swelling induced by Na+/solute cotransport. We have investigated this phenomenon by comparing a Na+/glucose (hSGLT 1) induced water flux to water fluxes triggered either by a cationic inward current (using ROMK 2 K+ channels) or by a glucose influx (using GLUT 2, a passive glucose transporter). These proteins were overexpressed in Xenopus oocytes and assayed through volumetric measurements combined with double-electrode electrophysiology or radioactive uptake measurements. The osmotic gradients driving the observed water fluxes were estimated by comparison with the swelling induced by osmotic shocks of known amplitude. We found that, for equivalent cation or glucose uptakes, the combination of substrate accumulations observed with ROMK 2 and GLUT 2 are sufficient to provide the osmotic gradient necessary to account for a passive water flux through SGLT 1. Despite the fact that the Na+/glucose stoichiometry of SGLT 1 is 2 : 1, glucose <b>accumulation</b> <b>accounts</b> for two-thirds of the osmotic gradient responsible for the water flux observed at t = 30 s.

Members who have a balance in a retirement phase account in excess of this limit will have until 30 June 2017 to either return the excess funds into accumulation phase or take the money out of superannuation. Retirement phase accounts in excess of this limit will be taxed at 15% on earnings, the same as for an <b>accumulation</b> phase <b>account.</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to measure the {{contribution}} of capital formation, labor, and technological progress to the growth of the Vietnamese economy, the impact of economic reforms (doi moi) since the end of 1986, and the rates of returns to capital and labor. Design/methodologyapproach – Cobb-Douglas production functions are built for Vietnam's economy and then estimated using annual data for 1975 - 2005. Findings – The two major findings are that: technological progress was statistically absent in the growth of the Vietnamese economy throughout the period studied; and the most important source of economic growth is capital <b>accumulation,</b> <b>accounting</b> for between 84 percent and 89 percent of Vietnamese economic growth throughout the period 1975 - 2005, and between 85 percent and 90 percent in the reform period (1986 - 2005). Originality/value – This paper is the first of its kind in the Vietnamese literature that successfully sheds light on, among other things, the roles of capital and technological progress in the Vietnamese economy during the period 1975 - 2005. It also makes clear that Vietnam's economic growth has been fueled mainly by foreign funds and, thus, the continued heavy reliance of the economy on this financial source will make its growth unsustainable. In order to achieve sustainable growth in the coming decades, Vietnam must shift to rely more on productivity growth, which has been absent so far, and less on factor accumulation growth.
