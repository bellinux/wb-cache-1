5|$|Aspiration may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> in {{secondary}} pneumothorax of moderate size (air rim 1–2cm) without breathlessness, with the difference that ongoing observation in hospital is required {{even after a}} successful procedure. American professional guidelines state that all large pneumothoraces – even those due to PSP – should be treated with a chest tube. Moderately sized iatrogenic traumatic pneumothoraces (due to medical procedures) may initially be treated with aspiration.|$|E
5|$|In New Zealand, Maori {{have raised}} the martial art {{associated}} with the taiaha and mere {{to the level of}} a weapon dance. The haka could <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> as a weapon dance, as it includes elements of warlike challenge to chanting and musical (sung) accompaniment.|$|E
5|$|Other {{potential}} {{causes of}} {{signs and symptoms}} that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis {{that need to be}} ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus. Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered.</b> The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).|$|E

5|$|Properties {{common to}} {{terrestrial}} organisms (plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria) {{are that they}} are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. An entity with these properties is generally considered life. However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential. Human-made analogs of life may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> to be life.|$|E
5|$|According to the plan, {{the type}} of {{consumption}} (i.e. whether agricultural, industrial and civil) will <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> when setting energy prices. The subsidy plan will be implemented in proportion with geographical regions because warm regions consume more electricity during summer while cold regions consume more gas during winter. Finally, the time of consumption (i.e. during peak and off-peak hours) and the consumption demand (i.e. whether it is low or high) will be taken into consideration.|$|E
5|$|In {{women with}} {{cervicitis}} (inflammation of the cervix) or vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) and in {{young men with}} UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrheae infection may be the cause. These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. Vaginitis may also {{be due to a}} yeast infection. Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics. Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> in the differential diagnosis.|$|E

The MSE can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> part of the comprehensive physical examination performed by physicians and nurses although it may be performed in a cursory and abbreviated way in non-mental-health settings. Information is usually recorded as free-form text using the standard headings, but brief MSE checklists are available for use in emergency situations, for example by paramedics or emergency department staff.|$|E
5|$|Many feminist economists argue {{economics}} {{should be}} focused less on mechanisms (like income) or theories (such as utilitarianism) {{and more on}} well-being, a multidimensional concept including income, health, education, empowerment and social status. They argue that economic success {{can not be measured}} only by goods or gross domestic product, but must also be measured by human well-being. Aggregate income is not sufficient to evaluate general well-being, because individual entitlements and needs must <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered,</b> leading feminist economists to study health, longevity, access to property, education, and related factors.|$|E
5|$|The P90 is {{currently}} in service with military and police forces in over 40 nations, such as Austria, Brazil, Canada, France, Greece, India, Malaysia, Poland, and the United States. In the United States, the P90 is in use with over 200 law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Secret Service. While developed and initially marketed as a PDW, it can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> a submachine gun or compact assault rifle. The standard selective fire P90 is restricted to military and law enforcement customers, but since 2005, a semi-automatic version has been offered to civilian shooters as the PS90.|$|E

5|$|The {{basic concept}} of Gibanica, a cake or pie {{involving}} {{a combination of}} pastry with cheese in differentiated layers often combined with layers of various other fillings, is common in the cuisines of the Balkans, Anatolia, and the Eastern Mediterranean. For example, a similar dish known as Shabiyat (Sh'abiyat, Shaabiyat) {{is part of the}} cuisine of Syria and Lebanon. Gibanica can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> to resemble a type of cheese strudel, with which it likely shares a common ancestry in the pastry dishes of the region, and the cuisines of the Byzantine and Ottoman empires.|$|E
5|$|The {{protection}} of infrastructure must <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> within emergency preparedness. Critical facilities {{that need to}} remain operable should be identified, and all others should be shut down to reduce damage. It {{is also important to}} keep ash out of buildings, machinery and lifeline networks (in particular water and wastewater systems,) to prevent some of the damage caused by ash particles. Windows and doors should be closed and shuttered if possible, to prevent ingress of ash into buildings.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a strong}} vintage {{aircraft}} movement in the UK, with two-thirds of the 500 registered historic aircraft active. These cover the whole spectrum of civil and military aviation, examples being the de Havilland Dragon Rapide airliner of the 1930s, and the World War II (WWII) Spitfire fighter. There are many post-WWII aircraft which could <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> historic under a looser definition, including for example 60 ex-military jets such as the Hawker Hunter. Historic aircraft are regular exhibits at air displays, which are {{claimed to be the}} second most popular spectator activity after football in the UK.|$|E

5|$|Chlorine {{perchlorate}} (ClOClO3) is a {{pale yellow}} liquid {{that is less}} stable than ClO2 and decomposes at room temperature to form chlorine, oxygen, and dichlorine hexoxide (Cl2O6). Chlorine perchlorate may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> a chlorine derivative of perchloric acid (HOClO3), similar to the thermally unstable chlorine derivatives of other oxoacids: examples include chlorine nitrate (ClONO2, vigorously reactive and explosive), and chlorine fluorosulfate (ClOSO2F, more stable but still moisture-sensitive and highly reactive). Dichlorine hexoxide is a dark-red liquid that freezes to form a solid which turns yellow at −180°C: it is usually made by reaction of chlorine dioxide with oxygen. Despite attempts to rationalise it as the dimer of ClO3, it reacts more {{as though it were}} chloryl perchlorate, +−, which has been confirmed to be the correct structure of the solid. It hydrolyses in water to give a mixture of chloric and perchloric acids: the analogous reaction with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride does not proceed to completion.|$|E
5|$|Those with {{epilepsy}} or seizures {{are typically}} denied a pilot license. In Canada {{if an individual}} has had {{no more than one}} seizure, they may be considered after five years for a limited license if all other testing is normal. Those with febrile seizures and drug related seizures may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered.</b> In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration does not allow those with epilepsy to get a commercial pilot license. Rarely, exceptions can be made for persons who have had an isolated seizure or febrile seizures and have remained free of seizures into adulthood without medication. In the United Kingdom, a full national private pilot license requires the same standards as a professional driver's license. This requires a period of ten years without seizures while off medications. Those who do not meet this requirement may acquire a restricted license if free from seizures for five years.|$|E
5|$|However, Han {{beliefs in}} the afterlife were not uniform across the empire and changed over time. Not only were there many {{different}} burial customs and views on how one journeyed through the afterlife, but even the names hun and po for spirit-soul and body-soul could be substituted with demon (gui 鬼) and spirit (shen 神). Demons, or gui, {{were thought to be}} partial manifestations of the deceased which lacked their essential vital energy (qi 氣) that had to be exorcised when they maliciously caused the living to become ill; however, a demon could <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> a neutral 'ghost'. Spirits, or shen, were usually associated with the animalistic spirits embodying certain places, such as the Earl of the Yellow River (He Bo 河伯). If proper sacrifices were made to these spirits, it was believed to bring good fortune; if ritual sacrifices were neglected, the spirit could inflict bad fortune on individuals and local communities. In the Western Han, texts left behind in tombs illustrate that the living took a more sympathetic view towards the dead than in the Eastern Han, when spirits were generally more feared as dangers to the living. The Western Han 'letters informing the underground' (gaodishu 告地書) were written to 'inform the Ruler of the Underground' 告地下王 about the deceased's wants and needs for clothing, vessels, and implements. However, 'tomb-quelling texts' (zhenmuwen 鎮墓文) that appeared during the 1st century CE acted as passports for the dead so that they did not disturb or bring danger to the living. Both Western Han and Eastern Han tombs contained 'land contracts' (diquan 地券) which stated that the deceased owned the land they were buried in.|$|E
