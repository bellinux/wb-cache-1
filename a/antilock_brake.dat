40|$|Nowadays, better driving {{also means}} better braking. To this end, vehicle {{designers}} must find all failures during the design phase of <b>antilock</b> <b>braking</b> systems which {{play an important}} role in automobiles safety. However, mechatronic systems are so complex and failures can be badly identified. So it is necessary to propose a design approach of an <b>antilock</b> <b>braking</b> system which will be able to avoid wheels locking during braking and maintain vehicle stability.

The Toyota Synergy Drive and the Rav4 EV use a system where a modified ABS (<b>antilock</b> <b>brake</b> system) actuator is coupled with a special hydraulic brake master cylinder to create a hydraulic system, coupled with the brake control unit (computer).Ford's system is almost identical to the Toyota system, and the General Motors system uses different nomenclature for components while the operation is virtually identical.|$|E

Most automotive engine controllers incorporate a [...] "limp mode" [...] for each sensor, so that the engine will continue to operate if the sensor or its wiring fails. Another, more trivial example of a limp mode is that some cars test door switches, and automatically turn lights on using seat-belt occupancy sensors if the door switches fail.|$|E

Controlling the force and friction of the blank holder is imperative {{to assure that the}} sheet metal is not locked on the blank holder, and hence it flows smoothly into the die. The simulation was developed based on the material displacement, deformation and deep drawing force on flange in the radial direction, that it is controlled by blank holder with <b>antilock</b> <b>brake</b> mechanic system. The force to blank holder was applied periodically and the magnitude of force was kept constant during simulation process.

The diameter and the depth of the cylindrical cup-shaped product were 40 mm and 10 mm, respectively. The simulation results showed that the application of <b>antilock</b> <b>brake</b> mechanic system improves the ability to control the material flow during the drawing process, although the maximum blank holder force of 13000 N was applied. The optimum condition was found when the drawing process was performed using blank holder force of 3500 N, deep drawing force of 7000 N, friction coefficient of 0. 25 and speed of punch stroke of 0. 84 mm/sec.
