40|$|The case {{company has}} {{recently}} established a shared services department with an objective to provide services, such as finance and accounting services, to its <b>associate</b> <b>companies.</b> These <b>associate</b> <b>companies</b> are operating in different countries, {{are subjected to}} different tax requirements, and have varied need for services and resources. Costs driven by these customers should be allocated efficiently and fairly. Thus, ‘one fit all’ chargeback approach is not sustainable in long run and may raise concern from tax authorities, <b>associate</b> <b>companies,</b> and SSC itself when trying to cover its expenses and managing to operate efficiently. Such complex situation has triggered a need for reassessment of current chargeback model. This is a commissioned case study. The main objective of this thesis is to perform a thorough evaluation of current chargeback model, discuss findings, and recommend solutions that might solve the current issues and act {{as a tool for}} future needs. A thorough analysis of all stakeholders having direct impact on current model was performed. In addition, two relevant chargeback methods were chosen and feasibility analyses were carried out for comparison. In the end, findings from all three analyses were compared and discussed. The main finding of this study demonstrated that existing issues are not directly caused by price or allocation methods rather are more operational related. The study showed no conflict between case provider and stake holders because of fees charged, and the likelihood of such occurrence is minimum unless there is a significant change in tax law or in the criteria for managers’ performance appraisal. Modification or replacement of current model will not fix these issues rather strategic action from both parties is recommended...|$|R

50|$|An <b>associate</b> <b>company</b> (or <b>associate)</b> in {{accounting}} and business valuation {{is a company}} in which another company owns {{a significant portion of}} voting shares, usually 20-50%.
