5|$|Both the Human {{fleet and}} the rebel Cylons are disillusioned after finding Earth devastated by a nuclear holocaust, which {{occurred}} at least 2,000 {{years prior to}} the events of the episode. After research on the bodies found in the soil, the Cylons and Dr. Baltar (James Callis) conclude the remains are not Human, but Cylon in origin. The rebel Cylons further state the mechanical Cylon remains resemble older Centurions of theirs, but are of a kind unknown to them. Following this, they postulate that the Thirteenth Tribe consisted of a different kind of Cylon which existed over 2,000 years ago and moved out from Kobol to populate Earth. When addressing the fleet, Admiral Adama (Edward James Olmos) never states this fact, leaving the fleet in the belief that the Thirteenth Tribe was human. Meanwhile, Samuel Anders (Michael Trucco), Galen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas) and Tory Foster (Rekha Sharma) receive memories showing that they had lived and died on Earth 2,000 years ago. Kara Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) has Leoben (Callum Keith Rennie) help track the origins of the beacon. However, what they find is a crashed Colonial Viper, containing a corpse with Starbuck's dog tags. After Kara recites what the Hybrid has told her, Leoben becomes scared and retreats, with Thrace wondering what she is. In shock, Thrace takes the body and burns it on a pyre, and decides to not tell anyone <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> found, making people believe she lost the signal.|$|E

25|$|The {{case had}} first been brought by Cheryl Churchill, {{a nurse in}} the {{obstetrics}} ward at McDonough District Hospital, operated {{by the city of}} Macomb, Illinois. During a dinner break one night in early 1987, she had been talking with another nurse who was considering transferring to obstetrics. In that conversation she made statements critical of cross-training practices recently implemented by the hospital's nursing supervisor, Cindy Waters, and referred to personal issues between the two. Another nurse who overheard the conversation believed Churchill's comments about Waters had dissuaded her interlocutor from the transfer, and reported it to Waters. After an investigation in which Churchill alleged she was never asked <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had said, she was fired.|$|E

25|$|There {{was further}} {{controversy}} in July 2007 when Fincham {{was accused of}} misleading BBC One viewers.

Fincham admitted the error, but rejected calls that he should resign from his position as a result. His future was deemed uncertain following critical comments from Sir Michael Lyons, Chairman of the BBC Trust and he resigned on 5 October 2007.|$|E
