5|$|Although the area's first Spanish explorers {{named the}} feature Mesa Verde, {{the term is}} a misnomer, <b>as</b> <b>true</b> mesas are almost {{perfectly}} flat. Because Mesa Verde is slanted to the south, the proper geological term is cuesta, not mesa. The park {{is made up of}} several smaller cuestas located between canyons. Mesa Verde's slant contributed to the formation of the alcoves that have preserved the area's cliff dwellings.|$|E
5|$|By {{complexity}} of technology: In situ technologies are usually classified either <b>as</b> <b>true</b> in situ processes or modified in situ processes. True in situ processes {{do not involve}} mining or crushing the oil shale. Modified in situ processes involve drilling and fracturing the target oil shale deposit to create voids in the deposit. The voids enable a better flow of gases and fluids through the deposit, thereby increasing the volume {{and quality of the}} shale oil produced.|$|E

5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} {{the crew of the}} Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise-D. In this episode, the crew rescue three Klingons from a damaged freighter in the neutral zone. Once aboard they befriend Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn) and attempt to hijack the Enterprise so they can live <b>as</b> <b>true</b> Klingons, forcing Worf to choose between them or Starfleet.|$|E
5|$|A {{year into}} development, Activision {{proposed}} that Black Lotus be made {{part of an}} existing franchise and highlighted similarities to the True Crime series; both games were set in open worlds with plots centred on an undercover cop in a criminal organization. Sales of previous True Crime games had been disappointing, but Activision felt the innovations in Black Lotus could revitalize the franchise and make the game successful in its own right. Activision attached the game to the series and revealed {{it to the public}} <b>as</b> <b>True</b> Crime: Hong Kong in November 2009. They delayed the game until 2010 to allow further refinement. During this period Hollywood action editor Tony Ciccone was hired to consult on the game's visual identity and animations.|$|E

5|$|After all, {{young people}} are always searching for the beauty in love. They want their love to be beautiful. If they give in to weakness, {{following}} the models of behavior that can rightly be considered a 'scandal in the contemporary world' (and these are, unfortunately, widely diffused models), {{in the depths of}} their hearts they still desire a beautiful and pure love. This is <b>as</b> <b>true</b> of boys as it is of girls. Ultimately, they know that only God can give them this love. As a result, they are willing to follow Christ, without caring about the sacrifices this may entail.|$|E
5|$|Both popes {{sent their}} legates {{to the catholic}} kingdoms {{in order to secure}} their recognition. At the council of Pavia in February 1160 Emperor Frederick I {{declared}} himself in favour of Victor IV, and the episcopate of the Empire followed him, with the significant exception of archbishop of Salzburg Eberhard I von Hilpolstein-Biburg and his suffragans. King Valdemar I of Denmark also gave his support to Victor IV, but the primate of Denmark archbishop Eskil of Lund became partisan of Alexander III. It seems that Poland also supported Victor IV. The rest of Europe, namely France, England, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Scotland, Hungary, Sicily and the Latin territories in Outremer, recognized Alexander III <b>as</b> <b>true</b> Pope, even if in some of these countries there were a significant Victorine minorities in episcopates or among feudal rulers. The papal schism in Europe was now a fact.|$|E
5|$|Decisive for {{the verdict}} about the {{legality}} of both pontificates were not the legal arguments, but {{the attitude of the}} Catholic world, which had almost universally recognized Innocent II. His main supporters were Abbot Bernard of Clairvaux, Archbishop of Magdeburg Norbert of Xanten and King Lothair III of Germany. The few secular lords who had initially supported Anacletus gradually abandoned his cause as lost; only King Roger II of Sicily, who had received the crown from Anacletus in exchange for support, stood at his side to the very end. Although Anacletus II was able to retain the control of the city of Rome and the Patrimony of St. Peter until his death in January 1138, his successor quickly made his submission to Innocent II, who is now regarded <b>as</b> <b>true</b> Pope.|$|E

5|$|Even {{within the}} Bond canon, Goldfinger is acknowledged; the 22nd Bond film, Quantum of Solace, {{includes}} {{an homage to}} the gold body paint death scene by having a female character dead on a bed nude, covered in crude oil. Outside the Bond films, elements of Goldfinger, such as Oddjob and his use of his hat as a weapon, Bond removing his drysuit to reveal a tuxedo underneath and the laser scene have been homaged or spoofed in works such <b>as</b> <b>True</b> Lies, The Simpsons, and the Austin Powers series. The US television programme MythBusters explored many scenarios seen in the film, such as the explosive depressurisation in a plane at high altitudes, the death by full body painting, an ejector seat {{in a car and}} using a tuxedo under a drysuit.|$|E
5|$|Kunivas' {{condition}} worsens, and Korris, Konmel, and Worf {{are present}} when he dies, {{and the three}} let out a fierce roar as per Klingon custom. As they return to the Klingons' quarters, Konmel is disappointed that Kunivas was not killed by an enemy, leading Worf to question {{the nature of the}} attack on the freighter; Korris and Konmel quickly change the subject. Worf forces Korris to reveal the truth: the three had commandeered the freighter, in order to seek out a place they could live <b>as</b> <b>true</b> Klingons, and the damage to the freighter was a result of a battle with a Klingon ship. When the two are seen near the ship's battle bridge, hoping to steal the drive section and escape the crew on the saucer, they are placed in the brig.|$|E
5|$|Nymphs live {{primarily}} in streams under rocks, in decaying vegetation, or in sediments. Few species live in lakes, {{but they are}} among the most prolific. For example, the emergence of one species of Hexagenia was recorded on Doppler weather radar by the shoreline of Lake Erie in 2003. In the nymphs of most mayfly species, the paddle-like gills do not function as respiratory surfaces because sufficient oxygen is absorbed through the integument, instead serving to create a respiratory current. However, in low-oxygen environments such as the mud at the bottom of ponds in which Ephemera vulgata burrows, the filamentous gills act <b>as</b> <b>true</b> accessory respiratory organs and are used in gaseous exchange.|$|E

5|$|Porcelain: Although glazed {{ceramics}} existed beforehand, {{the author}} and historian Samuel Adrian M Adshead writes that the earliest type of vitrified, translucent ceramics that could be classified <b>as</b> <b>true</b> porcelain was not made until the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The archaeologist Nigel Wood of the University of Oxford states that true porcelain was manufactured in northern China from roughly {{the beginning of the}} Tang Dynasty in the 7th century, while true porcelain was not manufactured in southern China until about 300 years later, during the early 10th century.|$|E
5|$|The storylines {{follow the}} three couples {{as they try}} to stay {{faithful}} to each other. They are held back by issues such as impotence, infidelity, and unplanned pregnancy. Their lives are further complicated by their jobs, money troubles, and moving in together. Bullen embellished the scripts with events from his own personal life. The directors and producers made additional contributions, with the intent to keep the fiction in the programme <b>as</b> <b>true</b> to life as possible. The series was filmed in Greater Manchester {{in the first half of}} 1998, using Granada Television's studios, and exterior locations.|$|E
5|$|The {{version of}} events {{recorded}} by history {{is based on the}} accounts of Burnham, Ingram and Gooding, the Matabele present at the battle (particularly inDuna Mjaan), and the men of Forbes's column. Burnham, Ingram and Gooding's stories closely corroborate each other; their {{version of events}} was accepted <b>as</b> <b>true</b> by the Court of Inquiry at Bulawayo in December 1893. First-hand Matabele accounts such as Mjaan's, which were first recorded during 1894, appear to confirm the character of the break-out, saying that three of the white men they were fighting—including Burnham, whom several of them recognised—left during a lull in the battle, just after Wilson withdrew to his final position.|$|E

5|$|Various {{types of}} tornadoes include the {{multiple}} vortex tornado, landspout and waterspout. Waterspouts {{are characterized by}} a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current, connecting to a large cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud. They are generally classified as non-supercellular tornadoes that develop over bodies of water, but there is disagreement over whether to classify them <b>as</b> <b>true</b> tornadoes. These spiraling columns of air frequently develop in tropical areas close to the equator, and are less common at high latitudes. Other tornado-like phenomena that exist in nature include the gustnado, dust devil, fire whirls, and steam devil.|$|E
5|$|Abdominal {{segments}} 3–6 and 10 each bear {{a pair of}} {{legs that}} are more fleshy. The thoracic legs are known <b>as</b> <b>true</b> legs and the abdominal legs are called prolegs. The true legs vary little in the Lepidoptera except for reduction in certain leaf-miners and elongation in the family Notodontidae. The prolegs contain {{a number of small}} hooks on the tip, which are known as crochets. The families of Lepidoptera differ in the number and positioning of their prolegs. Some larvae such as inchworms (Geometridae) and loopers (Plusiinae) have five pairs of prolegs or less, while others like Lycaenidae and slug caterpillars (Limacodidae) lack prolegs altogether. In some leaf-mining caterpillars there are crochets present on the abdominal wall which are reduced prolegs, while other leaf-mining species lack the crochets entirely. The abdominal spiracles are located {{on each side of the}} body on the first eight abdominal segments.|$|E
5|$|Ale can be {{defeated}} by zmajeviti men, {{who have a}} human mother, but a dragon father. They look like ordinary people except for little wings beneath their armpits; such men are always born at night after a twelve-month term. Much like a zduhać, a zmajeviti man lives like everybody else {{when the weather is}} nice, but when an ala leads threatening clouds into sight, he falls into a trance and his spirit comes out of his body and flies up to the clouds to fight with the ala, just like a dragon would do. A story from Banat, which was held <b>as</b> <b>true</b> until the 1950s, says that before World War I, an exhausted ala {{in the form of a}} giant snake fell from the clouds onto a road. The explanation of the event was that the ala was defeated in her fight with a zmajeviti man; people gave her milk to help her recover.|$|E
