This is true, for example, in the high-quality reproduction of music and in communications systems.

In professional noise-reduction systems, compression is "undone " by precisely-matched nonlinear expansion during reproduction. Similar techniques are often used in conveying speech over noisy channels, where the performance is more likely to be measured in terms of word-intelligibility than audio fidelity. The reciprocal processes of compressing and expanding are implemented using "compandors", and many schemes have been devised to achieve this function.

We examined {{the degree to which}} these three components of song convey complementary versus redundant information, in eastern song sparrows, Melospiza melodia melodia. One measure of song complexity, syllable repertoire size, was positively related to syllable sharing with other birds in the local population. This finding suggests that these aspects convey somewhat redundant information and that local-sounding song may in part advertise song-learning ability. <b>A</b> second measure <b>of</b> song complexity, song repertoire size, was positively related to song output, despite the widely differing developmental timescales over which song complexity and output are thought to vary. Condition during early development may have carryover effects on adult condition; alternatively, complex singers may have most to gain from advertising this attractive signal. Finally, despite our finding that both syllable sharing and song output were related to song complexity, syllable sharing and song output were not themselves significantly correlated.

Processing gain is a term often used to describe an SNR improvement. The processing gain of spectral analysis depends on the window function, both its noise bandwidth (B) and its potential scalloping loss.

Experimental characterization of kinase substrates is both expensive and time-consuming. To expedite the discovery of novel substrates, computational approaches based on kinase recognition sequence (motifs) from known substrates, protein structure, interaction and co-localization have been proposed. However, rarely do these methods {{take into account the}} dynamic responses of signaling cascades measured from in vivo cellular systems. Given that recent advances in mass spectrometry-based technologies make it possible to quantify phosphorylation on a proteome-wide scale, computational approaches that can integrate static features with dynamic phosphoproteome data would greatly facilitate the prediction of biologically relevant kinase-specific substrates. Results: Here, we propose a positive-unlabeled ensemble learning approach that integrates dynamic phosphoproteomics data with static kinase recognition motifs to predict novel substrates for kinases of interest. We extended a positive-unlabeled learning technique for an ensemble model, which significantly improves prediction sensitivity on novel substrates of kinases while retaining high specificity. We evaluated the performance of the proposed model using simulation studies and subsequently applied it to predict novel substrates of key kinases relevant to insulin signaling. Our analyses show that static sequence motifs and dynamic phosphoproteomics data are complementary and that the proposed integrated model performs better than methods relying only on static information for accurate prediction of kinase-specific substrates...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{includes}} three different <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> neural <b>signalling,</b> <b>a</b> new mathematical {{model for the}} action potential and its propagation, <b>an</b> experiment <b>of</b> how general anaesthetic affect the membrane <b>of</b> <b>a</b> neuron and speculations about what mechanisms underlie pain relief of the bioelectric dressing; ProcelleraTM. At present the mathematical models for an action potential and its propagation is based on Hodgkin & Huxley´s model which is heavily founded on experimental result and consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> very complex expression. This thesis present a new model {{which is based on}} the observed phenomenon that the axon is expanded when the action potential is transferred, this results in a much simpler expression. These equations are also visualized through simulations in finite element method based programme, COMSOLTM and show the same behaviour as an action potential, i. e. a pulse shape. The essential feature of general anaesthetic is that it inhibits neural signals. How it does this is debated in the scientific community. Different field of science provides different explanations. There is a well known rule; the Meyer-Overton rule which says that the effect of general anaesthetic is proportional to its solubility in olive oil which resembles the axon membrane. This thesis presents experiments where QCM-D (Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation monitoring) is used to observe how the resonance frequency and dissipation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> membrane is change when general anaesthetic is dissolved in it. It also present an experiment monitoring the electrical properties changes of the membrane due to general anaesthetic. The bioelectric dressing ProcelleraTM is at present claimed to reduce the pain sensation in a wound, by inhibition of the pain signal. The dressing contains zinc and silver elements and therefore this thesis speculates in how these metals can result in pain reduction. This speculation discuss different receptors inhibition, chemical reactions and other mechanisms which are possible to occur in the interaction of the dressing and the wound...|$|R
