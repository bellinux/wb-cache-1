25|$|People's self-verification strivings <b>are</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> be most {{influential}} when the relevant identities and behaviors matter to them. Thus, for example, the self-view should be firmly held, the relationship should be enduring, {{and the behavior}} itself should be consequential. When these conditions are not met, people will be relatively unconcerned with preserving their self-views and they will instead indulge their desire for self-enhancement. In addition, self-reported emotional reactions favor self-enhancement while more thoughtful processes favor self-verification.|$|E
25|$|The {{group of}} gorillas {{is led by}} one or more adult males. In cases where there are more than one silverback males in a group, they are most likely father and son. Groups {{containing}} only one male are believed to be the basic unit of the social group, gradually growing in size due to reproduction and new members migrating in. In the study done at Lope, gorillas harvest most of their food arboreally, but less than half of their night nests are built in trees. They are often found on the ground and are made up of up to 30 gorillas. Western lowland gorillas live in the smallest family groups of all gorillas, with an average of 4 to 8 members in each. The leader (the silverback) organizes group activities, like eating, nesting and travelling in their home range. Those who challenge this alpha male <b>are</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> be cowed by impressive shows of physical power. He may stand upright, throw things, make aggressive charges, and pound his huge chest while barking out powerful hoots or unleashing a frightening roar. Despite these displays and the animals' obvious physical power, gorillas are generally calm and nonaggressive unless they are disturbed. Young gorillas, from three to six years old, remind human observers of children. Much of their day is spent in play, climbing trees, chasing one another and swinging from branches.|$|E

500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 1901 season, team captain Hugh White gave head coach Fielding Yost and trainer Keene Fitzpatrick substantial credit for the performance of the 1901 team. He credited the coach with [...] "inoculating into the men some of Mr. Yost's own spirit, impulsiveness and optimism," [...] and with having the [...] "faculty of adapting his plays to the material at hand so that he got the best there was out of every one of the eleven men." [...] With respect to the trainer, White noted:"An equally strong element, and one many <b>are</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> overlook, was the work of Keene Fitzpatrick. Consider a team training nearly four months, without a man going stale, and but one injured so that he had to be taken out of the game! Then in addition a trip of nearly 3000 miles, from a climate where the thermometer registered 10 degrees below zero, into one of summer weather, and eleven men playing through an entire game and finishing it with faster and stronger play than at the beginning! Such were the results achieved by our trainer. ... Too much praise cannot be given him." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Way You Love Me" [...] is an R-dance-pop song which {{displays}} {{influences of}} electro, and rock music. It features a [...] "squealing" [...] synth, a banging fast-paced beat, screaming, rough {{as well as}} at times hoarse vocals and blaring sonics. According to the staff members of Idolator, the beat in the background is augmented by hand-claps similar to that of [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" [...] (2008) by Beyoncé Knowles, most noticeable toward the end. According to a press release by Interscope Records, the song's lyrics make reference to a [...] "raw infectious club-thumping message to female empowerment" [...] and about being in a committed relationship. She further said the sentiment reflected in the song is [...] "exactly what her girls <b>are</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> shout behind closed doors" [...] and that the lyrics are meant to reflect a woman's many moods and shifting desires: [...] "I write from a female perspective, but I'm also telling men what women are really thinking and feeling about them. I don't want to be held and caressed every night. I'm talking about one man in the relationship. I'm not talking about being a slut and a whore." ...|$|E
500|$|Trimmer {{is perhaps}} most famous now for her {{condemnation}} of fairy tales, such as the various translations of Charles Perrault's Histoires ou Contes du Temps passé (1697). She disliked fairy tales because they endorsed an irrational {{view of the world}} and success without work. Trimmer's view of fairy tales, although often ridiculed by modern critics, was widespread {{at the end of the}} eighteenth century, in part because most educators accepted John Locke's theory that the mind was a tabula rasa and therefore particularly sensitive to impressions early in life. Trimmer was opposed to fairy tales that were not grounded in reality and which would [...] "excite an unregulated sensibility" [...] in the reader. Without a proper moral or a moralizing narrator, fairy tales could lead a reader astray. Above all, she was concerned about [...] "unmediated", unknown, and unsupervised feelings in the child reader. One of the reasons Trimmer believed fairy tales were dangerous was because they led child readers into a fantasy world where adults could not follow and control their exposure to harmful experiences. She was just as horrified by the graphic illustrations included with some fairy tale collections, complaining that [...] "little children, whose minds are susceptible of every impression; and who from the liveliness of their imaginations <b>are</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> convert into realities whatever forcibly strikes their fancy" [...] should not be allowed to see such scenes as Blue Beard hacking his wife's head off.|$|E
500|$|No {{artist was}} ever more true to his aim. Ideals resolutely pursued <b>are</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> provoke the {{resentment of the}} world, and Burne-Jones encountered, endured and conquered an {{extraordinary}} amount of angry criticism. Insofar as this was directed against the lack of realism in his pictures, it was beside the point. The earth, the sky, the rocks, the trees, {{the men and women of}} Burne-Jones are not those of this world; but they are themselves a world, consistent with itself, and having therefore its own reality. Charged with the beauty and with the strangeness of dreams, it has nothing of a dream's incoherence. Yet it is a dreamer always whose nature penetrates these works, a nature out of sympathy with struggle and strenuous action. Burne-Jones's men and women are dreamers too. It was this which, more than anything else, estranged him from the age into which he was born. But he had an inbred [...] "revolt from fact" [...] which would have estranged him from the actualities of any age. That criticism seems to be more justified which has found in him a lack of such victorious energy and mastery over his materials as would have enabled him to carry out his conceptions in their original intensity. Yet Burne-Jones was singularly strenuous in production. His industry was inexhaustible, and needed to be, if it was to keep pace with the constant pressure of his ideas. Whatever faults his paintings may have, they have always the fundamental virtue of design; they are always pictures. His designs were informed with a mind of romantic temper, apt in the discovery of beautiful subjects, and impassioned with a delight in pure and variegated colour.|$|E

2500|$|He {{is quick}} to add however, {{that it would be}} presumptuous to {{conclude}} that writing alone determined the course of civilizations. Historians naturally focus on writing because it endures. [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> overlook the significance of the spoken word," [...] he writes, [...] "and to forget that it has left little tangible remains." [...] For Innis, this tendency poses a problem. [...] "It is scarcely possible for generations disciplined in the written and the printed tradition to appreciate the oral tradition."

2500|$|In the harsher {{world of}} the 1980s and 1990s {{it was no longer}} obvious that Keynes was right in 1931 and the bankers wrong. [...] Pre-Keynesian orthodoxy had come in from the cold.

2500|$|Innis {{argued that}} the [...] "bias" [...] of each medium either toward space or toward time helps {{determine}} {{the nature of the}} civilization in which that medium dominates. [...] "Media that emphasize time are those that are durable in character such as parchment, clay and stone," [...] he writes in his introduction. These media tend to favour decentralization. [...] "Media that emphasize space <b>are</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> be less durable and light in character, such as papyrus and paper." [...] These media generally favour large, centralized administrations. Innis believed that to persist in time and to occupy space, empires needed {{to strike a balance between}} time-biased and space-biased media. Such a balance is likely to be threatened however, when monopolies of knowledge exist favouring some media over others.|$|E
2500|$|At an {{everyday}} practical level {{the links between}} information entropy and thermodynamic entropy are not evident. Physicists and chemists <b>are</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> {{be more interested in}} changes in entropy as a system spontaneously evolves away from its initial conditions, in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics, rather than an unchanging probability distribution. And, as the minuteness of Boltzmann's constant [...] indicates, the changes in [...] for even tiny amounts of substances in chemical and physical processes represent amounts of entropy that are extremely large compared to anything in data compression or signal processing. Furthermore, in classical thermodynamics the entropy is defined in terms of macroscopic measurements and makes no reference to any probability distribution, which is central to the definition of information entropy.|$|E
