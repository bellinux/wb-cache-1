5|$|Over {{the years}} the FDA interviewed physicians, Reich's {{students}} and his patients, <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> the orgone accumulators. A professor at the University of Oregon who bought an accumulator told an FDA inspector that he knew the device was phoney, but found it helpful because his wife sat quietly in it for four hours every day.|$|E
5|$|According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Horton Hatches the Egg {{was born}} in 1940, the day after New Year's, {{when he took a}} break from drawing in his Park Avenue {{apartment}} and went for a walk. When he returned, he noticed that he had left a window open in his studio and that the wind had blown one sketch on transparent paper on top of another, making it look like an elephant was sitting in a tree. This account was based on interviews with Geisel, who had told similar stories about the book's creation to reporters <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> his creative process since as early as 1957. The story had changed with each telling but always involved the fortuitous juxtaposition of drawings of an elephant and a tree.|$|E

50|$|People in Zambia {{were not}} {{continuously}} counted by race before independence, {{and when they}} were counted by race it were primarily the non-Africans/non-blacks who were counted. People were counted by language only in 1931, while they were counted for ethnicity at various points since 1969. The 1969 census <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> language but not ethnic group, and the 1974 census <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> ethnic group, but not language. The 1980 census <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> ethnic group, mother tongue, and language of most frequent use, while the 1990 census <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> ethnic group and mother tongue. The 2000 census <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> ethnic group, language of most frequent use, and second language.|$|R

5|$|Two years later, Mark {{returns to}} Erinsborough. He tells Kate that Holland has died, {{so he was}} able to leave witness protection. Mark {{explains}} that his death had to be faked after Holland put out a hit on him. After learning that Kate had been <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> him, he believed that she wanted to see him again. Mark explains that he has been living in the Blue Mountains and working as an abseiling instructor. Mark and Kate spend time together, which makes her boyfriend, Mason, jealous. Mark also catches up with Lucas and Kyle. He tries to persuade Kate that her future is with him and they kiss. But when Mason learns Mark has a girlfriend in Sydney, he tells Kate, resulting in a fight between himself and Mark. Mark tells Kate {{that he was going to}} propose to his girlfriend, but wanted to see where things stood between them first. Kate chooses Mason and Mark leaves. Months later, Mason runs into Mark in Lysterfield, where he asks for his help as Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) has been injured abseiling. Mark accompanies the group to the hospital, where he runs into Kate. Mark decides to stay in Erinsborough and is offered a job at Fitzgerald Motors by Danni Ferguson (Laura McIntosh). He also moves into Number 24.|$|E

25|$|The instant {{appeal of}} the Daleks caught the BBC off guard, and {{transformed}} Doctor Who from a Saturday tea-time children's educational programme to a must-watch national phenomenon. Children were alternately frightened and fascinated by the alien look of the monsters, and the Doctor Who production office was inundated by letters and calls <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> the creatures. Newspaper articles focused attention on the series and the Daleks, further enhancing their popularity.|$|E
25|$|Soon after Peete {{began working}} for the Logans, she began telling neighbors that Arthur Logan had fits of rage and {{physically}} attacked her and Margaret on several occasions. On June 1, 1944, Margaret Logan disappeared. Three days later, Arthur Logan was committed to Patton State Hospital by Peete {{who claimed to be}} his foster sister. When neighbors began <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> Margaret Logan's whereabouts, Peete claimed that Arthur Logan had attacked his wife in a frenzy and bitten her nose so severely that she was left disfigured. When Peete's husband began <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> Margaret Logan's whereabouts, Peete reiterated that Arthur Logan had attacked his wife and added that Margaret had gone into seclusion to undergo plastic surgery. For the next six months, Peete and her husband continued to live in the Logans' home. As she had with Jacob Denton, Peete began spending the Logans' money and forging their names on checks. On December 6, 1944, Arthur Logan died while still committed to Patton State Hospital. Peete donated his body to science.|$|E
25|$|Nothing {{changed in}} my life since I work all the time. I've spent 30 years writing fiction. For the first 10 years, I worried about money and no one asked how much money I made.

And I've spent the last 10 years with {{everyone}} expecting to hear how I spend the money, which I will not do.|$|E
3000|$|A {{key feature}} of the {{algorithm}} is how choose Candidates(· [...]) actually selects the regions to <b>ask</b> <b>about.</b> In contrast to Algorithm  2 which, in each round, randomly selects a region to <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> (which we call the random spatial crowdsourcing), the algorithm we propose later will use a neighbourhood association heuristic to select regions to <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> which will be called associative spatial crowdsourcing. We first discuss the performance of two versions of random spatial crowdsourcing below, one without a heuristic as above and another with a heuristic that embraces failure.|$|R

In practice this law (like the law forbidding dowries) is widely ignored, and levels of abortion on female foetuses remain high and the sex ratio at birth keeps getting more skewed.|$|E

25|$|By not <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> the horses, Confucius {{demonstrates}} that the sage values human beings over property; readers are led to reflect on whether their response would follow Confucius's and to pursue self-improvement if it would not have. Confucius, as an exemplar of human excellence, serves not as an all-powerful deity or a universally true set of abstract principles, but rather the ultimate model for others. For these reasons, according to many commentators, Confucius's teachings may be considered a Chinese example of humanism.|$|E

25|$|The idea of <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> being may {{be traced}} back via Aristotle to Parmenides. Heidegger claimed to have revived the {{question}} of being, the question having been largely forgotten by the metaphysical tradition extending from Plato to Descartes, a forgetfulness extending to the Age of Enlightenment and then to modern science and technology. In pursuit of the retrieval of this question, Heidegger spent considerable time reflecting on ancient Greek thought, in particular on Plato, Parmenides, Heraclitus, and Anaximander, {{as well as on}} the tragic playwright Sophocles.|$|E
25|$|The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) {{struggled}} {{to implement the}} Court's holding in Beck. In 1989, the National Right to Work Committee polled NLRB offices nationwide, posing as workers and <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> the requirement to pay union dues. The group found that Board agents and other staff at 22 of 29 offices gave the wrong information. Although the NLRB initially dismissed the report, {{within a few weeks}} the agency admitted its errors and ordered all its regional offices to review recent developments in labor law and provide accurate information on agency fee rights.|$|E

Cameron admitted in a press conference following the issuance of the NTSB report that he assumed the problem was a garbage bin fire, a common cause of lavatory fires when smoking was still allowed on flights.|$|E
