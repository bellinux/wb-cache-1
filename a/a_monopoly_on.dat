5|$|The route Stavanger–Bergen–Trondheim {{was awarded}} to Vestlandske Luftfartsselskap in 1956, but this company filed for {{bankruptcy}} the following year. Ålesund Airport, Vigra was {{scheduled to open in}} 1958, and both Braathens SAFE and SAS applied for the concession, along with the route along the West Coast. At first the ministry wanted to issue the concession on the route Stavanger – Bergen – Ålesund – Trondheim to Braathens SAFE and the route Ålesund–Oslo to SAS. But after negotiations, Braathens SAFE stated they were willing to fly the coastal route without subsidies if they were granted the Oslo-route, since {{that would allow them to}} cross-subsidize; this was granted by the ministry. An agreement was then made between the ministry, SAS and Braathens SAFE, where both airlines would fly the routes Oslo–Trondheim, Oslo–Stavanger, Oslo–Kristiansand and Kristiansand–Stavanger–Bergen; Braathens SAFE had <b>a</b> <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> the routes Oslo–Ålesund and Bergen–Ålesund–Trondheim, while SAS was granted <b>a</b> <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> the routes Oslo–Bergen and (Oslo)–Trondheim–Bodø–Bardufoss.

This ranged from civil transport and cargo to transporting political prisoners to the gulags, and more.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the mid-3rd {{century the}} {{emperors}} began to favor {{members of the}} equestrian order over senators, who had had <b>a</b> <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> the most important offices of state. Senators were stripped of the command of legions and most provincial governorships (as {{it was felt that}} they lacked the specialized military upbringing needed in an age of acute defense needs), such posts being given to equestrians by Diocletian and his colleagues—following a practice enforced piecemeal by their predecessors. The emperors, however, still needed the talents and the help of the very rich, who were relied on to maintain social order and cohesion by means of a web of powerful influence and contacts at all levels. Exclusion of the old senatorial aristocracy threatened this arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Despite rising {{traffic to}} Las Vegas, WAE reduced {{service to the}} city amid the Great Depression. Once its {{financial}} situation improved, the airline bought the airfield and established <b>a</b> <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> flights. When the city attempted to purchase the field and build a more modern terminal, WAE refused. With the advent of World War II, however, WAE was pressured to sell the airfield. Nevadan Senator Pat McCarran helped obtain federal funding {{for the city to}} buy the field and construct a new terminal. He also helped establish a gunnery school by the United States Army Air Corps at the field. For the senator's contributions, the airport was named McCarran Field in 1941.|$|E
5|$|Dieselisation {{occurred}} from 1951 {{with the}} F class shunter, but the B and S classes of 1952 and 1957 revolutionised main line operations.

Apart from the F class, Clyde Engineering has had <b>a</b> <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> Victorian diesel-electric locos. as the Australian licensee of General Motors EMD engines and traction motors, fitting them into locally designed bodies. By the 1980s the first generation locomotives were approaching {{the end of their}} lives, with the electric locomotives withdrawn by 1988, and the modern N and G classes allowing the withdrawal of lower power T and Y classes.|$|E

5|$|Early on in {{the gold}} rush, the US Army sent a small {{detachment}} to Circle City, in case intervention was required in the Klondike, while the Canadian government considered excluding all American prospectors from the Yukon Territory. Neither eventuality took place and instead the US agreed to make Dyea a sub-port of entry for Canadians, allowing British ships to land Canadian passengers and goods freely there, while Canada agreed to permit American miners {{to operate in the}} Klondike. Both decisions were unpopular among their domestic publics: American businessmen complained that their right to <b>a</b> <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> regional trade was being undermined, while the Canadian public demanded action against the American miners.|$|E

It was subsequently renamed Northumberland House.|$|E

5|$|Tudor's {{plan was}} to export ice as a luxury good to wealthy members of West Indies and the {{southern}} US states, where he hoped they would relish the product during their sweltering summers; conscious of the risk that others might follow suit, Tudor hoped to acquire local monopoly rights in his new markets {{in order to maintain}} high prices and profits. He started by attempting to establish <b>a</b> <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> the potential ice trade in the Caribbean and invested in a brigantine ship to transport ice bought from farmers around Boston.
