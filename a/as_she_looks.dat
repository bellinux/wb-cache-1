Suddenly, he is attacked by a tiger and Katy dumps her bags and runs off screaming. She approaches a lake and is almost bitten by a crocodile when she tries to take a drink. She sits on a rock and ends up with a tarantula crawling on her. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> into the lake while singing the chorus, she sees a reflection of a tiger instead of herself. Behind her in the darkness there are dozens of pairs of blinking eyes, but they are revealed to be fireflies which fly around her before forming an image of a roaring tiger in the sky.|$|E

Clark expresses fear that Lana is {{drifting}} away because of his secret, so he decides to reveal his powers to her. Clark then uses the coal to make a diamond ring and proposes marriage. Afterward, Clark reveals {{what he did to}} his parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent (John Schneider and Annette O'Toole), who tell him that he is old enough to make decisions on his own without the advice of his father.

5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} view of Rihanna lying in open waters, as other scenes of {{diamonds}} being rolled in a manner suggestive of making a joint are intercut– a scene reminiscent of the single's artwork. As the video progresses Rihanna is shown running on a highway. In a black-and-white scene, Rihanna licks the joint and begins smoking it. The image fades to black as the song begins. Rihanna performs in the same black-and-white setting while in a black corset. Images of Rihanna on a bed in a room while singing are shown, with objects breaking, curtains falling and roses burning in reverse effect. Rihanna is shown again on the highway, running away from {{what appears to be the}} headlights of a chasing car. She then stops <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> up to the night sky at an aurora view. Throughout the video, Rihanna's hand is shown intertwined with that of a heavily tattooed man, whose face is not shown in the video. As the second verse starts, Rihanna is shown in a desert where horses run freely. Scenes of a street battle are later shown, depicting burning cars and broken glass around the environment. As the video continues, the singer and her lover's hands are shown slowly slipping apart, with only their fingertips touching towards the conclusion of the video. The video ends with Rihanna once again floating alone in the open waters.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{is invited}} by her boss Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) to spend Christmas {{with him to}} help him deal with a visit from his mother, Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch). Liz finds it strange that Jack's fiancée Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) will not spend the holiday with him and {{immediately}} realizes that Jack has not told his mother about Avery's pregnancy. Avery becomes angry, but she and Liz convince him to tell her which he promises to do. Jack tells Colleen about the news {{but she is not}} excited about the pregnancy as Jack and Avery are not married. To get back at her, Jack calls his biological father Milton Greene (Alan Alda), the father she never told him he had, and invites him to spend Christmas with him, and does not inform him that Colleen will be present. The next day, Milton arrives and Jack explains the reason for his visit is so that he can ambush Colleen <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> down on his relationship with Avery. Later, Avery arrives and is angered about what Colleen said about her relationship with Jack. Liz tries to warn Colleen about Jack's plan but to no avail. She is shocked to see Milton, but immediately figures out what Jack is up to. Colleen gets even with Jack by faking a heart attack, which causes Milton and Avery to feel sorry for her thus abandoning their plan to reprimand Colleen. At the hospital, Avery reveals that she and Jack had planned to elope over New Year's and extends an invitation to everyone.

25|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts a}} woman in a fine white and blue satin dress with gold trimmings. She sits on a platform a step higher than the black and white marble floor, her right foot on a terrestrial globe and her right hand on her heart <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> up, adoringly, at a glass sphere hung from the ceiling by a blue ribbon. Her left arm rests {{on the edge of a}} table which holds a golden chalice, a large book, and a dark-wood crucifix. Behind the crucifix is a gilt-leather panel screen. Beneath the book is a long piece of cloth, possibly a priest's stole. Resting on top of the book is a crown of thorns. All of these items are on the platform, which is covered by a green and yellow rug, the edge of which is on the floor. At the bottom of the picture, nearer the viewer, is an apple, and nearer still a snake which has been squashed by a cornerstone. On the dim, far wall behind the woman, a large painting of Christ's crucifixion is hung on the wall behind the woman. To the viewer's left is a multicolored tapestry, pulled back at the bottom and seemingly the closest thing in the painting to the viewer. A chair with a blue cloth on it is immediately beneath and behind the tapestry and to the left of the snake and cornerstone.|$|E
500|$|From his {{relationship}} with Connie, Sam moved on to a love triangle storyline with Ward Sisters Faye Morton and Chrissie Williams. Kensit said of the relationship in August 2007, as the storyline was ongoing: [...] "For Faye, Sam is not Mr Right, simply Mr Right Now. [...] But Faye is not as sweet <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> - there's a streak of toughness there... It's all going to get very messy!" [...] Once his deception was uncovered, Sam attempted to salvage his romantic relationship with Chrissie, but was unsuccessful. For some weeks thereafter, Sam engaged in casual sexual relationships with Senior house officer Maddy Young and Staff Nurse Zoe Foxe. These were, however, stymied by the discovery he had cancer.|$|E

Additionally, her hair is no longer braided, but worn in a ponytail. According to Play, Lara [...] "moves as good <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> [...] no longer moves like a video game character" [...] due to her being fully motion captured. Olympic gymnast and NCAA Women's Gymnastics champion Heidi Moneymaker was the model used for motion capturing. Keeley Hawes provided the voice of Lara in this instalment, as she did in Anniversary and Legend. [...] Gymnast Alison Carroll {{was selected as the}} new official Lara Croft model to promote the game, replacing Karima Adebibe.|$|E

500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Red Carpet" [...] {{was directed by}} Hisashi Kikuchi, and was uploaded onto the singer's YouTube channel on November 19, 2015. It opens with Amuro walking through two large doors, wearing a coat-like dress; on the DVD editions of the single, a special customization function allows the viewer to change the colour of the dress. She strolls through several streets and sits down briefly on a small bench-seat, with {{several members of the}} public, including a young couple and small children. The second chorus has her gazing through a fashion boutique, admiring several pairs of heels. By the bridge section, sparks fall from the sky and are seen behind Amuro <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> upwards. Whilst the final chorus has her dancing as the sparks fall, the visual ends with the singer walking up several steps and posing for the camera.|$|E
500|$|In the {{flashback}} episode [...] "What Lies Beneath", exploring Faye's {{decision to}} move to Holby, she is seen to fight with her husband James, then later step over his dead body on the stairs. Kensit explained: [...] "there's a scuffle and he pins her {{against the wall and}} practically tries to rape her. He ends up dead. It's the way she deals with it — she coolly steps over his body and leaves. It turns out similar things have happened before." [...] Shortly after arriving in Holby, the character began a relationship with cardiothoracic registrar Sam Strachan (Tom Chambers). The situation soon escalated into a love triangle, with Sam reigniting his former relationship with Faye's colleague, Matron Chrissie Williams. Kensit said of the relationship in August 2007, as the storyline was ongoing: [...] "For Faye, Sam is not Mr Right, simply Mr Right Now. But Faye is not as sweet <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> - there's a streak of toughness there... It's all going to get very messy!" [...] Upon discovering Sam's infidelity, the character terminated their relationship, and became involved with his colleague Joseph Byrne.|$|E

A music video for the song was directed by Badu and Chris Robinson, and released on January 28, 2008.

In January 2008, Badu also previewed songs from the album as a headlining act at the Barbados Jazz Festival.

500|$|The video {{opens with}} a {{motorcycle}} gang cruising down a freeway, wearing studded leather jackets. The motorcycle gang are the Twelve Apostles who followed Jesus, including Judas. Gaga as Mary Magdalene clutches onto a Jesus-like figure (Rick Gonzalez) who wears a golden crown of thorns. Among the riders is Judas (Norman Reedus), who crosses Gaga's bike <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> meaningfully towards him. The gang passes under a flyover, when the song starts. They reach their rustic hideout called [...] "Electric Chapel" [...] where Gaga dances wearing a red sarong and a bikini top with crosses covering her nipples. Gaga's character watches curiously as the wily Judas enters the biker club and immediately gets involved in a brawl. While trying to protect Jesus from the fights she attempts to warn him about his apostle's impending betrayal, but becomes hypnotized by Judas' allure. The storyline is interspersed with choreographed dance sequences and close-ups of Gaga with stark imagery, including artistic eye make-up, which was compared to the Egyptian Eye of Horus. Her flowing blonde hair is accented by a red bandana, blue leather top and puffy white dress {{in different parts of}} the clip. The blue top worn by Gaga displays the [...] "Sacred Heart", a depiction of what Jesus is said to have revealed as a symbol of his love for humanity. During the second verses, Gaga points towards Peter during the line [...] "Build a house", and towards herself during [...] "Or sink a dead body".|$|E

[...] Robbie Daw from Idolator joked that [...] "from {{the look of}} things, {{it seems as if}} Miss Lopez's hair is having a close encounter of the third kind on the cover. Or maybe that's just her natural glow when she's up in the morning making flapjacks for the kids?" [...] The deluxe edition, which features sixteen tracks as opposed to twelve on the standard edition, features the same cover as the standard edition except the background and text is tinged blue instead of pink.|$|E

They return and interrupt Leela's wedding, bringing with them four women, each of a different species, and each scheduled to be married to Alcazar on the same day as Leela. Alcazar, flustered, involuntarily reveals his true nature as a shape-shifting, cricket-like alien. After the women beat him into submission, he explains that he played with their emotions in order to sell viewings of their sexual relations to voyeurs, and that he had to stage all the weddings on one day because tuxedos that change shape are expensive to rent. Leela leaves {{with the rest of the}} Planet Express crew. The Professor tells Leela she will have plenty of years to search for her true home while paying for the popcorn shipment she destroyed, but Leela disconsolately wonders [...] "How many planets could there be?" [...] <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> out at a vast, starry space.|$|E
2500|$|In the film's denouement, {{we realize}} that the real {{kidnapper}} was Jack's new wife, Amaya, {{with the help of}} her cousin, the Sheriff in Del Rio (who throughout the film appeared as if he was trying to help Jack and that he believed Jack's innocence). [...] We learn that the flashback we have seen throughout the film—of Jack/Roberto strangling a man at Katie's behest <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> on in delight—has new meaning. [...] The man Roberto strangled was Amaya's father. [...] Worse still, Amaya was in the room with Roberto and Katie when they strangled her father, hiding under the bed. [...] Amaya's father was a degenerate gambler who owed a large debt to Katie and the Mexican Mob, and when he could not pay, Katie had Roberto kill him. [...] Amaya witnessed all of this. [...] We realize that she then set in motion an elaborate plan to emigrate to the United States and marry Jack/Roberto in order to punish him for murdering her father. [...] It was Amaya and the Sheriff who kidnapped Toby. [...] Amaya and the Sheriff set fire to the room where Jack is (the same room where he killed Amaya's father many years ago). [...] But Jack is able to see that Toby is tied up on the bed in the room. [...] He manages to free her and they escape the fire unhurt.|$|E
