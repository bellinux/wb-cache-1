40|$|Background: Despite a close {{association}} between gastrointestinal motility and sex hormones, it has been unknown whether ovarian hormones affect absorption and metabolism of nutrients. The {{aim of this study}} is, therefore, to evaluate metabolism of acetate in rats with age and the influence <b>of</b> <b>ovariectomy</b> on its change. Methods: Fourteen female rats of the F 344 strain were used, and 13 C-acetate breath test was performed at 2, 7 and 13 months <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> Seven rats were ovariectomized at three weeks <b>of</b> <b>age</b> (<b>ovariectomy</b> group) and the remaining seven rats were studied as control group. After 24 -hr fasting, rats are orally administrated 1 ml of water containing sodium 13 C-acetate (100 mg/kg) and housed in an animal chamber. The expired air in the chamber is collected in a breath-sampling bag using a aspiration pump. The 13 CO 2 concentration is measured using an infrared spectrometer for 120 min and expressed as delta per mil. Results: The breath 13 CO 2 excretion increased with time and peaked 30 min in control rats. In ovariectomized rats, thee peak time of 13 CO 2 excretion was prolonged to 40 min at 7 and 13 months <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> Cmax was significantly higher at 2 months <b>of</b> <b>age</b> but lower at 4 months <b>of</b> <b>age</b> in ovariectomized rats than in control rats.

40|$|Summary. Ile-de-France ewes were ovariectomized during {{anoestrus}} or the mid-luteal {{phase of}} an oestrous cycle (day <b>of</b> <b>ovariectomy</b> = Day 0). In a short-term study, FSH concentrations were measured in blood samples collected hourly {{the day before}} and on Days 1, 3, 7 and 15 after ovariectomy (10 ewes per group). FSH concentrations increased significantly from 6 =. to 16 =. ng/ml within 1 day <b>of</b> <b>ovariectomy</b> and increased further to 47 =. ng/ml by Day 15. Differences between seasons <b>of</b> <b>ovariectomy</b> were not significant. In a long-term study, FSH concentrations were measured in blood samples collected hourly on Days 7, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 after ovariectomy in anoestrus or the breeding season (10 ewes per group). Further samples were taken (5 ewes/group) at 240 and 365 days after ovariectomy. The pattern ofchange in FSH after ovariectomy differed between the two seasons and the interaction between season and sampling day was significant. For ewes ovariectomized during anoestrus, FSH concentrations increased to a maximum by Day 180 and remained high thereafter. In contrast FSH increased more slowly in ewes ovariectomized in the breeding season and differences between the groups were significant from Day 90 to Day 270. However, both groups had similar FSH concentrations at Day 365. These results show that FSH concentrations increase rapidly after ovariectomy. There are seasonal differences in FSH concentrations in the absence of ovarian feed-back with increases in FSH concentration {{around the time of the}} onset of the breeding season. Once FSH concentrations had reached a maximum, major seasonal changes were no longer apparent...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>age,</b> <b>ovariectomy</b> and dietary phytoestrogen ingestion on adenosine A 2 B receptor mediated relaxant responses and mRNA expression of adenosine receptor subtypes in the rat isolated bladder. Female Wistar rats (8 weeks) were anaesthetised and the ovaries were removed (ovx) or left intact (sham). Rats were fed either normal rat chow (soy, phytoestrogens) or a non-soy (phytoestrogen free) diet. Isolated bladder from rats aged 12, 24 or 52 weeks were pre-contracted with 3 占carbachol prior to a concentration response curve to 5 '-(N-ethylcarboxamido) adenosine (NECA) being obtained. In 12 -week-old rats, the bladder exhibited enhanced relaxant responses to NECA in soy-fed rats (P< 0. 05), whilst at 24 weeks <b>of</b> <b>age,</b> the relaxant responses to NECA were attenuated in all the groups studied except soy-treated sham rat bladders in which the relaxant responses were enhanced. At 52 weeks <b>of</b> <b>age,</b> no relaxant effects were observed {{in any of the}} treatment groups and NECA-induced contractile responses occurred. In all bladders, the adenosine A 2 B receptor was the most abundantly expressed. In bladders from young and mature female rats, the mRNA expression of adenosine receptors (A 1, A 2 A and A 2 B) was lowest in the bladder from non-soy-fed ovariectomised animals and the use of phytoestrogens in the diet increased the mRNA expression of these receptors (P< 0. 05).

40|$|In a {{previous}} study we found that liver mitochondrial side-chain hydroxylation of vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) and of 5 beta-cholestane- 3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-triol was higher in female than in male rats [Saarem & Pedersen (1987) Biochem. J. 247, 73 - 78]. The present paper describes the effects <b>of</b> <b>age,</b> gonadectomy and hypophysectomy on these activities. The sex difference became manifest above the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 7 weeks. <b>Ovariectomy</b> and/or injection <b>of</b> oestradiol valerate {{had no effect on}} the hydroxylase activities in adult females. Castration increased, and subsequent testosterone treatment decreased, the hydroxylase activities in adult males. Hypophysectomy had no effect in females, but increased the hydroxylase activities in males. Testosterone treatment had no effect in hypophysectomized females or males. Injection of oestradiol valerate had no effect on the hydroxylase activities in hypophysectomized females. In hypophysectomized males this treatment had no effect on the vitamin D 3 25 -hydroxylase activity, but decreased the C 27 -steroid 27 -hydroxylase activity in males. Microsomal 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D 3 25 -hydroxylase activity was lower in females than in males in all age groups. Castration or hypophysectomy decreased the activity in male rats. It is concluded that, in adult female rats, the mitochondrial side-chain hydroxylation of vitamin D 3 and of 5 beta-cholestane- 3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-triol is independent of sex hormones. In males these activities are regulated by influence of sex hormones on the hypophysis, probably by the presence of androgens in the neonatal period.

40|$|Obstructive sleep apnoea {{syndrome}} (OSAS) is {{a devastating}} respiratory control disorder more common in men than women. The reasons for the sex difference in prevalence are multifactorial, but are partly attributable to protective effects of oestrogen. Indeed, OSAS prevalence increases in post-menopausal women. OSAS is characterized by repeated occlusions of the pharyngeal airway during sleep. Dysfunction of the upper airway muscles controlling airway calibre and collapsibility is implicated in the pathophysiology of OSAS, and sex differences in the neuro-mechanical control of upper airway patency are described. It is widely recognized that chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), a cardinal feature of OSAS due to recurrent apnoea, drives many of the morbid consequences characteristic of the disorder. In rodents, exposure to CIH-related redox stress causes upper airway muscle weakness and fatigue, associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Of interest, in adults, there is female resilience to CIH-induced muscle dysfunction. Conversely, exposure to CIH in early life, results in upper airway muscle weakness equivalent between the two sexes at 3 and 6 weeks <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> <b>Ovariectomy</b> exacerbates the deleterious effects of exposure to CIH in adult female upper airway muscle, an effect partially restored by oestrogen replacement therapy. Intriguingly, female advantage intrinsic to upper airway muscle exists with evidence of substantially greater loss of performance in male muscle during acute exposure to severe hypoxic stress. Sex differences in upper airway muscle physiology may have relevance to human OSAS. The oestrogen–oestrogen receptor α axis represents a potential therapeutic target in OSAS, particularly in post-menopausal women...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effects of different periods <b>of</b> <b>ovariectomy</b> and 17 beta-estradiol (E 2) replacement on the expression of Cytochrome C, apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) and Endonuclease-G (Endo-G) in mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions obtained from hippocampus of the adult female rats. in addition, the expression of phosphorylated CREB (phospho-CREB) was also analyzed in hippocampus. Ovariectomy or E 2 treatment did not change the expression of Cytochrome C and AIF. Ovariectomy (15, 21 and 36 days) decreased the expression of Endo-G in the mitochondrial fractions and increased it in the cytosolic fractions obtained from hippocampus. the treatment with E 2 after 15 days <b>of</b> <b>ovariectomy</b> for 7 days or 21 days, and throughout the post-ovariectomy period prevented the effects <b>of</b> <b>ovariectomy</b> on Endo-G expression. Our results suggest that ovariectomy-induced apoptotic cell death in hippocampal tissue could be mediated by Endo-G, but not by AIF, via a caspase-independent apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, ovariectomy decreased the expression of phospho-CREB and the treatment with E 2 prevented these effects. in conclusion, E 2 may help maintain long-term neuronal viability by regulating the expression of members of the Bcl- 2 family. Regulation of Endo-G released from mitochondria, but not of Cytochrome C and AIF, is also involved in the neuroprotective actions of E 2. Furthermore, CREB may be involved in the expression of Bcl- 2. These data provide new understanding into the mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective role of estrogen.

40|$|Heart {{disease is}} the leading cause of death in women in the United States. Premenopausal women appear to have better cardiac {{function}} and lower risk of heart disease compared to male postmenopausal female counterparts. Ovarian hormone loss influences blood pressure homeostasis and causes systemic inflammation, which may result in chronic stress on the heart. Two key physiological changes in cardiac dysfunction are reemergence of the fetal gene pattern and myocardial remodeling. Physical activity has been linked to improved cardiac function.

Uteri were evaluated histologically, and ER protein and mRNA expression were characterized immunohistochemically and by in situ hybridization. OVX {{did not affect}} uterine weight or endometrial thickness until after PND 60, when both in-creased more rapidly in intact gilts. Neither did it affect genesis of uterine glands, which were present and which proliferated after PND 0, or endometrial ER expression patterns in glandular epithelium (GE), luminal epithelium (LE), or stroma (S) between PND 0 and 120. Endometrium was ER negative at birth. On PND 15, the ER signal was strong in GE, weak in S, and effectively absent in LE. Thereafter, although the ER signal remained strong in GE and increased through PND 60 in S, it was not evident consistently until after PND 30 in LE. The data indicate that 1) porcine uterine growth and endometrial morphogenesis are ova-ry-independent processes before PND 60; 2) uterine gland gen-esis is associated temporally with development of ER-positive endometrial GE and S; and 3) regulation of endometrial ER ex-pression is ovary independent between PND 0 and 120.

SD rats aged 12 weeks were randomly divided into No-treatment, Sham and OVX groups. The rats were sacrificed for sample collection at week 0, week 4 and week 18 after surgical operation. Chemistries in serum and urine were measured by standard colorimetric methods and bone turnover markers were measured by ELISA kits. Bone mass and bone strength were determined using pQCT system and three-point bending tests, respectively. At week 4, OVX rats showed drastic {{increase in the}} level of urine Ca, P and DPD. At week 18, in OVX rats the levels of serum ALP, urine DPD and Ca were much higher and the level of serum Ca was much lower when comparing with Sham rats. Ovariectomy produced significant reduction in cancellous BMD, total BMD and SSI of proximal tibial metaphysis rapidly at week 4 and continuously at week 18 after surgical operation. However, no marked changes of bone mass and bone strength were found in the diaphysis of tibia and femur, respectively.

Crystallinity of bone was evaluated by measuring X-ray diffraction line broadening. After OVX, a nonsignificant bone loss was found at all measured sites in the femur (- 3 to - 9 %) together with a decreased biomechanical competence in the trabecular bone (compressive strain - 28 %, P < 0. 05). Treatment with salmon calcitonin, 50 or 100 IU subcutaneously three times a week from the time <b>of</b> <b>ovariectomy,</b> resulted in a significant dose-dependent preservation of bone strength in the trabecular bone of the femoral neck compared with OVX.

Tetracycline, calcein, and xylenol orange, respectively, were administered by a fluorochrome labeling procedure (2 d- 10 d- 2 d) just prior to each postoperative biopsy to provide markers of bone formation. Analysis of sequential biopsies provided a means to follow the response to ovariectomy over time and compare each animal against its own baseline. Examination of sequential biopsies indicated that cortical porosity increased by the fourth month after ovariectomy and remained high at 8. 5 months. Ovariectomy did not influence histomorphometric indices at one month after surgery, but substantial differences were observed at later times. Ovariectomy stimulated a transient increase in bone formation and was increased six-fold over that of SO dogs at four months. Ribs were also analyzed for mineral content at necropsy. The rib was heterogeneous along its length for calcium content and concentration. In the midrib where biopsies for histomorphometric analysis were taken, ovariectomy induced a decrease in mass and mineral content; total calcium was decreased by approximately 31 %.

Main methods: Hippocampi were obtained from rats in proestrus, ovariectomized (15 days, 21 days and 36 days), ovariectomized for 15 days and then treated with 17 beta-estradiol for 7 or 21 days, and rats ovariectomized and immediately treated with 17 beta-estradiol for 21 days. the expression of Bcl- 2 and Bax and the number of apoptotic cells were determined. Key findings: Ovariectomy decreased Bcl- 2 expression and increased Bax expression and the number of apoptotic cells. Replacement with 17 beta-estradiol (21 days) throughout the post-ovariectomy period reduced the number of apoptotic cells to the control levels, and prevented the effects <b>of</b> <b>ovariectomy</b> on Bax expression, but only partially restored the Bcl- 2 expression. After 15 days <b>of</b> <b>ovariectomy.</b> the replacement with 17 beta-estradiol for 21 days, but not for 7 days, restored the Bcl- 2 and Bax expression and the percentage of apoptotic cells to the levels found in the proestrus control. Significance: the present results show that a physiological concentration of 17 beta-estradiol may help maintain long-term neuronal viability by regulating the expression of members of the Bcl- 2 family. Even after a period of hormonal deprivation, treatment with 17 beta-estradiol is able to restore the expression of Bax and Bcl- 2 to control levels, but the duration of the treatment is a key factor to obtain the desired effect. These data provide new understanding into the mechanisms contributing to the neuroprotective action of estrogen. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We investigated the skeletal changes in the tibia of ovariectomized rats during treatment with whole body vibration (WBV). Different low-magnitude WBV treatment protocols were tested in a pilot experiment using ovariectomized rats with loading schemes of 2 x 8 min/day, 5 days/ week (n = 2 rats per protocol). Bone volume and architecture were evaluated during a 10 week follow-up using in-vivo microcomputed tomography scanning. The loading protocol in which a 45 Hz sine wave was applied at 2 Hz with an acceleration of 0. 5 g showed an anabolic effect on bone and was therefore further analyzed in two groups of animals (n = 6 each group) with WBV starting directly after or 3 weeks after ovariectomy and compared to a control (non- WBV) group at 0, 3, 6 and 10 weeks' follow-up. In the follow-up experiment the WBV stimulus did not significantly affect trabecular volume fraction or cortical bone volume in any of the treatment groups during the 10 week follow-up. WBV did reduce weight gain that was induced as a consequence <b>of</b> <b>ovariectomy.</b> We could not demonstrate any significant effects of WBV on bone loss as a consequence <b>of</b> <b>ovariectomy</b> in rats; however, the weight gain that normally results after ovariectomy was partly prevented.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} whether different estrogen manipulations have effects on the expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) in the adult female rat hippocampus. Hippocampus was obtained from rats in proestrus (control), ovariectomized for 2, 10 and 15 days, ovariectomized for 15 days and treated with 17 beta-estradiol for 7 days, and treated with 17 beta-estradiol immediately after ovariectomy for 21 days. Rats' estrogen status was monitored by measuring estradiol plasma levels and uterus relative weight. [3 H] quinuclidinyl benzilate ([H- 3] QNB) binding studies indicated that ovariectomy time-dependently increases the number of mAChRs in hippocampus when compared to those obtained from control rats. Estradiol treatments for 21 days avoid the effect <b>of</b> <b>ovariectomy.</b> However, the estradiol treatments for 7 days after 15 days <b>of</b> <b>ovariectomy</b> slightly change the number of mAChRs. in conclusion, these results showed that ovariectomy time-dependently increases mAChRs number in the rat hippocampus. in addition, these data suggest that treatment with estradiol initiated within a specific period of time after the loss of ovarian function may be effective at preventing specific effects of hormone deprivation on hippocampus.

40|$|The effects <b>of</b> <b>ovariectomy</b> (Ovx), {{menopause}} and oestrogen replacement on the haemodynamics remain controversial. The {{present study}} employed {{the technique of}} arterial impedance analysis to measure and calculate the steady and pulsatile haemodynamics. The purpose {{was to determine the}} haemodynamic consequence <b>of</b> <b>ovariectomy</b> and oestrogen replacement. Ovariectomy was carried out under anaesthesia on female Sprague Dawley rats aged 9 weeks. Oestrogen (17 β-estradiol or E 2) replacement started 1 week after ovariectomy for 4 weeks. Ovx increased the body weight (BW), while it greatly reduced the uterus weight. Left ventricular weight (LVW) was slightly increased, but LVW/BW ratio was slightly reduced. These changes were reversed after E 2 replacement. Compared to sham group, Ovx with or without E 2 replacement did not significantly affect the systolic, mean and diastolic pressure. In Ovx, pulse pressure (PP) and heart rate were significantly increased, while stroke volume and cardiac output were slightly decreased. Total peripheral resistance (TPR) was largely elevated, indicating Ovx induced systemic vasoconstriction. These changes all returned to close normal values (sham group) after E 2 replacement, except PP. Ovx increased the characteristic input impedance (Zc) and pulse wave reflection, while it decreased arterial compliance. E 2 treatment reversed these changes, except Zc. These results demonstrate that Ovx influences both the resistance and Windkessel functions of the artery. E 2 treatment effectively reverses most the effects of Ovx both on the steady and pulsatile haemodynamics...|$|R

Rats {{were kept in}} a room with the lights on from 0500 to 1900 h daily. Groups consisted of females ovariectomized (OVX) at 2 months <b>of</b> <b>age</b> and used at 4, 15 or 24 months <b>of</b> <b>age,</b> as well as rats ovariectomized at 13 or 22 months <b>of</b> <b>age</b> and used at 15 or 24 months <b>of</b> <b>age,</b> respectively. At Day 0, rats were bled at 7 -mm intervals for 84 mm through an atrial cannula and then injected s. c. with 50 pg EB in oil. At Day 3, 25 mg of Prog was injected s. c. in oil at 0900 h. Blood samples were collected at hourly intervals between 1100 and 2300 h on Days 2 and 3. At Day 4, blood samples were collected just prior to and after intravenous injection of long LHRH at 1730 h. In 4 -month-old: 2 -month-OVX controls, plasma LH concentration fluctuated in a pulsatile rhythm on Day 0 at levels about 20 -fold higher than that observed in intact cyclic rats during diestrus or estrus.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the study}} was to compare the use <b>of</b> open <b>ovariectomy,</b> to the video-assisted laparoscopic {{approach}} or total laparoscopic ovariectomy in Santa Ines ewes. Surgical time and body weight gain/loss were recorded and post-surgical pain assessed using a behavioral scale. Laparotomy involved a longer surgical time (75 ± 29. 5 min), than the video-assisted (37. 5 ± 13. 04 min; p< 0. 05) or total laparoscopic approach (27. 5 ± 2. 89; p< 0. 01). Behavioral pain recorded score was higher for the laparotomy ovariectomy (5. 6 ± 0. 5), compared to the video-assisted (0. 3 ± 0. 5) and laparoscopic approaches (0. 3 ± 0. 5) (p< 0. 0001). No significant differences were recorded regarding body weight gain/loss during the first 30 days post-surgery, between the techniques. The video-assisted laparoscopic and total laparoscopic techniques <b>of</b> <b>ovariectomy</b> showed a tendency to have more advantages than the use of laparotomy as such.
