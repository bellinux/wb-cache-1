The safety cylinder of the machine can ensure safety as well as lift supporting sleeve and static cone by a hydraulic system and automatically remove the blocks in the crushing chamber when the machine is suddenly stuffy. Thus the maintenance rate is greatly reduced and production efficiency is greatly improved as it can remove blocks without disassembling the machine.|$|E
50|$|Waulis design {{describes}} a crank device and an <b>adjusting</b> <b>device</b> of a combustion engine. The system adjusts the cylinder {{pressure of the}} motor {{in accordance with the}} required power. Adjustment of the cylinder pressure is achieved by changing the compression ratio by means of the <b>adjusting</b> <b>device.</b> The <b>adjusting</b> <b>device</b> moves an eccentric wheel to a set position using an adjusting wheel; this results in the connecting rod moving the piston to a desired distance from the cylinder head. The <b>adjusting</b> <b>device</b> measures the volume of the air entering the cylinder and adjusts the compression ratio appropriately. The <b>adjusting</b> <b>device</b> also takes into account the speed of rotation to adjust the compression pressure accordingly.|$|E

This paper describes three such cases, along with a discussion about their circumstances. The use of MADs may cause both direct and indirect complications for chiropractic patients. The notion that MADs might be safer than conventional articular manipulation procedures might not be accurate. The use of improper force by the practitioner, and/or the lack of a “fail-safe” mechanism on the MAD might contribute to adverse effects and/or injuries from MADs.

25|$|The Banu Musa also invented an {{automatic}} flute player {{which may have}} been the first programmable machine. The flute sounds were produced through hot steam and the user could <b>adjust</b> the <b>device</b> to various patterns so that they could get various sounds from it.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first task}} was to create the {{illusion}} of sound [...] "moving" [...] across neighboring speakers. It was found that by placing two speakers roughly 20 feet apart it was possible to produce a [...] "moving" [...] sound, but the effect could not be achieved through simple volume control. The problem was solved with a three-circuit differential junction network named the [...] "pan pot" [...] (panoramic potentiometer), that allowed sound to progressively travel using constant fades with a left, center and right speaker configuration. The second issue was dynamic range, the difference in volume between the loudest and quietest sounds. The dynamic range of typical film soundtracks at the time was limited to a poor signal-to-noise ratio of about 40 dB. This was tackled by increasing the volume during loud passages and reducing it during quiet ones, to which the dynamic range would increase. A tone-operated gain <b>adjusting</b> <b>device,</b> or [...] "Togad," [...] was built that varied the volume of the replayed sound under the control of a tone of varying amplitude. This device was the predecessor of the automated mix-down systems found in modern recording studios.|$|E
