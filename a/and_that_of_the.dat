5|$|A mock-up was {{manufactured}} in Japan after Kawasaki won the contract. It was shipped to Singapore {{and put on}} public display during the 1984 National Exhibition held in November 1984 at World Trade Centre. The mock-up featured three choices of seating arrangements and colour schemes; {{members of the public}} were invited to give feedback on these options. The finalised interior design of the C151 trains consisted of a fully longitudinal seating arrangement. The bucket seats were made of plastic; glass partitions separated the seating areas from the passenger doors. Strap lines for standing passengers were installed in the middle of every car. The colour scheme of each adjacent car's interior is distinct to make car identification in cases of fault reporting easier for passengers. Originally the colour scheme of the driving trailer cars was orange, that of the second and fifth motor cars was blue, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two centre motor cars was green. There were nine seats between two doors; this was reduced to seven after the first round of refurbishment.|$|E

It also features an exclusive 'Wind Fortress' level. Recently the game got an update that added exclusive Machine Gun Challenge. The game was included as a bonus game in the Humble Indie Bundle 4 sale in December 2011, Humble Bundle 7 in December 2012, and was released on the Desura service in April 2012. On 19 January 2017, Nicalis announced a port of Cave Story + on the Nintendo Switch, which released on 20 June 2017. This version is packaged with a full-color manual for the game and a Mini CD containing arrangements of the game's soundtrack made in FamiTracker, a chiptune music tracker based on the Famicom's synthesizers. Additionally, GameStop purchases of the Nintendo Switch version include one of three keychains modeled after Quote, Curly, and Balrog.|$|E
5|$|Before marching towards Antioch, Khalid and Abu Ubaidah {{decided to}} isolate the city from Anatolia; this was done by {{capturing}} all the fortresses that were providing strategic defense to Antioch, most importantly A'zāz at north east of Antioch. In order to save the empire from annihilation, a desperate battle was fought between the Muslim army <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defenders of Antioch outside the city near Orontes river, popularly known as Battle of Iron bridge. The Byzantine army was composed of the survivors of Yarmouk and other Syrian campaigns. After being defeated, the Byzantines retreated to Antioch and the Muslims besieged the city. Having little hope of help from emperor, Antioch surrendered on 30 October 637, with the terms that all Byzantine troops would be given safe passage to Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|Constantinople's {{cultural}} influence {{extended from}} Sicily to Russia. Armenia, as a border state between the Roman-Byzantine and Sasanian empires, {{was influenced by}} both. The exact relationship between Byzantine architecture <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Caucasus is unclear. Georgia and Armenia produced many central planned, domed buildings in the 7th century and, after a lull during the Arab invasions, the architecture flourished again in the Middle Byzantine Period. Armenian church domes were initially wooden structures. Etchmiadzin Cathedral (c. 483) originally had a wooden dome covered by a wooden pyramidal roof before this was replaced with stone construction in 618. Churches with stone domes became the standard type after the 7th century, perhaps benefiting from a possible exodus of stonecutters from Syria, but the long traditions of wooden construction carried over stylistically. Some examples in stone {{as late as the}} 12th century are detailed imitations of clearly wooden prototypes. Armenian church building was prolific in the late 6th and 7th centuries and, by the 7th century, the churches tend to be either central plans or combinations of central and longitudinal plans. Domes were supported by either squinches (which were used in the Sasanian Empire but rarely in the Byzantine) or pendentives like those of the Byzantine empire, and the combination of domed-cross plan with the hall-church plan could have been influenced by the architecture of Justinian. Domes and cross arms were added to the longitudinal cathedral of Dvin from 608 to 615 and a church in Tekor. Other domed examples include Ptghnavank in Ptghni (c. 600), a church in T'alinn (662-85), and the Cathedral of Mren (629-40).|$|E
5|$|Cromwell {{did much}} work through his many offices {{to remove the}} tasks of {{government}} from the Royal Household (and ideologically from the personal body of the King) and into a public state. He did so, however, in a haphazard fashion that left several remnants, not least because he needed to retain Henry's support, his own power, {{and the possibility of}} actually achieving the plan he set out. Cromwell made the various income streams put in place by Henry VII more formal and assigned largely autonomous bodies for their administration. The role of the King's Council was transferred to a reformed Privy Council, much smaller and more efficient than its predecessor. A difference emerged between the financial health of the king, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country, although Cromwell's fall undermined much of his bureaucracy, which required his hand to keep order among the many new bodies and prevent profligate spending that strained relations as well as finances. Cromwell's reforms ground to a halt in 1539, the initiative lost, and he failed to secure the passage of an enabling act, the Proclamation by the Crown Act 1539. He too was executed, on 28 July 1540.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{and authors}} {{writing about the}} 1954 coup have debated the {{relative}} importance {{of the role of the}} United Fruit Company and the worries about communist influence (whether or not these were grounded in reality) in the U.S.'s decision to instigate the coup in 1954. Several historians have maintained that the lobbying of the UFC, and the expropriation of its lands, were the chief motivation for the U.S., strengthened by the financial ties of individuals within the Eisenhower administration to the UFC. Others have argued that the overthrow was motivated primarily by U.S. strategic interest; the knowledge of the presence of a small number of communists close to Árbenz led the U.S. to reach incorrect conclusions about the extent of communist influence. Yet others have argued that the overthrow was part of a larger tendency within the U.S. to oppose nationalist movements in the Third World. Both the role of the UFC <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perception of communist influence continue to be cited as motivations for the U.S.'s actions today.|$|E
5|$|Illicit distilleries were commonplace {{throughout}} the Speyside area from medieval times but were largely made redundant {{with the passing}} of the Excise Act in 1823. It was under this legislation that legal distilleries could be formed, subject to holding a license. Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon, was allegedly instrumental in the passing of this legislation. Although there is no historical record of his involvement in the issue, his tenant, George Smith, who was operating an illicit distillery at the time, became the first person in Glenlivet to apply for and receive a license to legally produce spirit. This would prove to be an unpopular decision; every other distiller was operating illegally at the time and hoping the new Excise Act would be repealed, something which would not happen if some distillers accepted the new law. Threats were made against George Smith, so George Gordon provided Smith with two pistols to be used to ensure both his own safety <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distillery. In 1824, The Glenlivet distillery was established at Upper Drumin by George and his youngest son John Gordon Smith.|$|E

5|$|In the Emperor's eyes, {{the deaths}} of his sons seemed to presage {{the end of the}} {{imperial}} system. His younger son had represented his future <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monarchy. Although the Emperor still had a legal successor in his daughter Isabel, he had little confidence that a woman could rule Brazil in the male-dominated social climate of the time. He did nothing to prepare Isabel for the responsibilities of ascending the throne, nor did he attempt to encourage acceptance of a female ruler among the political class. The lack of a male heir caused him to lose motivation in promoting the imperial office as a position to be carried on by his descendants; he increasingly saw the imperial system as so inextricably linked to himself that it could not survive him.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of Dunedin's settlement, much of the city's growth was on two areas of {{reasonably}} flat land close to the harbour, separated by the large Bell Hill and an area of low swampy land. The northern of these two flat areas surrounded the floodplain of the Water of Leith, a small river that runs through Dunedin. As the city grew the swamp was drained to become the new city's centre, and the hill was lowered by excavation to allow access between the two areas of settlement. A street grid was set up with the main road split in two by the city centre (now The Octagon) - Princes Street to the south and George Street to the north. As with many of the city's other place names, both these names <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Water of Leith reflect the names of places in Edinburgh.|$|E
