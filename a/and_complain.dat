But at least they think that Tommy can go through a whole movie without any fuss. Because they didn't see the ending, Didi and Stu decide to go out to see the movie again next week, but at a different theater. As Grandpa Lou eats a candy bar in the back seat, Tommy takes notice of a flashing Reptar billboard as they drive by.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} an unknown person {{lighting}} a candle in the homicide squadroom. One by one, the detectives arrive for the night shift on an unusually hot September evening. A furious Gee (Yaphet Kotto) calls maintenance {{to complain about the}} non-working air conditioner and learns it has been shut off for the night. Felton (Daniel Baldwin) and Lewis (Clark Johnson) try to find out who secretly lights the candle every night; they blow it out a number of times, but it always ends up lit again without anyone noticing. Munch (Richard Belzer) loudly complains about his ex-girlfriend breaking up with him. While the other detectives sweat <b>and</b> <b>complain</b> about the heat, a calm and comfortable Pembleton (Andre Braugher) wears a tie and drinks hot tea without sweating. Bayliss (Kyle Secor), who acts uncooperative with his partner Pembleton, says he has found the fingerprints of a man named James Hill who he believes is the murderer in the Adena Watson case. Officer Thormann (Lee Tergesen) brings in Hill, who {{turns out to be a}} 12-year-old boy (Kenny Blank), much to the amusement of the other detectives.|$|E

25|$|The {{dialogue}} journal's reciprocal discourse {{structure is}} often cited as the motivation for both teacher and student to continue their engagement with each other over time without external coercion. The reciprocal nature of the discourse provides multiple opportunities to {{develop an understanding of}} the other person's world, culture, and experiences, and thus learning occurs for both. The power to question, challenge, <b>and</b> <b>complain</b> becomes equally shared by both writers.|$|E

25|$|According to H. L. Oldie, {{writing in}} Russian is {{an easier way}} for Ukrainian authors to be {{published}} and reach a broader audience. The authors {{say that it is}} because of Ukraine's ineffective book publishing policy: while Russian publishers are interested in popular literature, Ukrainian publishers rely mostly on grant givers. Many Ukrainian publishers agree <b>and</b> <b>complain</b> about low demand and low profitability for books in Ukrainian, compared to books in Russian.|$|E
25|$|After {{arriving}} {{at his new}} location, Sulayman sent notice of his movements to 'Ali ibn Muhammad, who approved and ordered him to send any food supplies and animals back to the central Zanj camp. This caused a dispute to break out between Sulayman, who attempted to send the supplies back on barges, and al-Jubba'i, who believed that any supplies they found should be burned in order to deny their use by the government. Al-Jubba'i began ignoring Sulayman's commands, prompting the latter to write to 'Ali <b>and</b> <b>complain.</b> The Zanj leader therefore intervened and sent orders to al-Jubba'i, instructing him to obey Sulayman and follow his commands.|$|E
500|$|After the United Kingdom general election, 1895, Rosebery and Fowler were {{replaced}} by Lord Salisbury and Lord George Hamilton respectively. Hamilton thought Karim was not as dangerous as some supposed {{but that he was}} [...] "a stupid man, and on that account he may become a tool in the hands of other men." [...] In early 1896, Karim returned to India on six months' leave, and Hamilton and Elgin placed him under [...] "unobtrusive" [...] surveillance. They dared not be too obvious lest the Munshi notice <b>and</b> <b>complain</b> to the Queen. Despite fears that Karim might meet with hostile agents, his visit home appears to have been uneventful.|$|E

Brown was elected in 1967 to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. [...] "I feel he's as fine a coach as the game ever has had", Otto Graham said at the induction ceremony. [...] "I used to cuss him out <b>and</b> <b>complain</b> but now I'm happy that I played under him." [...] In 2009, Sporting News named Brown as the 12th greatest coach of all time; only two other NFL coaches were listed above him.|$|E
500|$|Friction {{with the}} provincial {{government}} rose notably when, in October 1771, Allen and a company of Boys drove off a group of Scottish settlers near Rupert. Allen detained two of the settlers and forced them to watch the torching of their newly constructed cabins. He then ordered them to leave, saying, [...] "Go your way now, <b>and</b> <b>complain</b> to that damned scoundrel your Governor, God damn your Governor, Laws, King, Council, and Assembly". [...] When the settlers protested his language Allen continued the tirade, threatening to send any troops from New York to Hell. In response, New York's governor, William Tryon, issued warrants for the arrests of those responsible, and eventually put a price of £20 on the heads of six participants, including Allen. Allen and his comrades countered by issuing offers of their own.|$|E
500|$|On 26 December 1887, Frederick {{wrote that}} his [...] "chronic catarrh" [...] {{appeared}} to be taking [...] "a turn for the better and that [...] "a further bond has been forged between our people and myself; may God preserve it by giving me, when I resume my duties, the capacity to prove myself worthy of the great trust that has been shown me!" [...] A week later, however, on 5 January 1888, his hoarseness and the swelling under his left vocal cord returned, with the previously unaffected {{right side of his}} throat becoming inflamed. He ran high fevers and began coughing violently, with his breathing becoming more laboured. The doctors diagnosed perichondritis, an infection of the throat membrane. Frederick again became unable to speak, and suffered violent headaches and insomnia. On 29 January, Mackenzie returned to San Remo from a trip to Spain, and after examining his patient recommended an immediate tracheotomy. [...] The operation was conducted at 4 p.m. on 8 February, by which time Frederick was continually suffering from insomnia and [...] "embarrassing bouts of suffocation." [...] A cannula was fitted to allow Frederick to breathe; for the remainder of his life he was unable to speak and often communicated through writing. During the operation, Dr. Bergmann almost killed him by missing the incision in the trachea and forcing the cannula into the wrong place. [...] Frederick started to cough and bleed, and Bergmann placed his forefinger into the wound to enlarge it. The bleeding subsided after two hours, but Bergmann's actions resulted in an abscess in Frederick's neck, producing pus which would give Frederick discomfort for the remaining months of his life. Later, Frederick would ask [...] "Why did Bergmann put his finger in my throat?" [...] <b>and</b> <b>complain</b> that [...] "Bergmann ill-treated [...] ".|$|E

2500|$|Although {{there is}} the belief that people with SPD are complacent and unaware of their feelings, many {{recognize}} their differences from others.

[...] Moses pleads for the privacy to mourn his sister in peace, and reminds the people that they have other officials and elders to whom they can appeal, but the people are implacable and threaten to stone Moses immediately if he does not produce water.|$|E

Her coach, Keith Hennig, a former player at Central Washington University who is 6inches taller than Vandersloot, regularly played one-on-one against her either {{before or after}} the team's practice. He would later say, [...] "I did not take it easy on her at all. I was more physical than anything she's ever been used to. At times, I wasn't too nice. I would ride her and foul her.

2500|$|The fairies live in {{a lavish}} and art-filled Fairyland, {{floating}} on a cloud overlooking the mortal world. Three male fairies, Ethais, Phylion and Lutin, relate to the female fairies their [...] "detestation" [...] at their experiences below, in the [...] "wicked" [...] world. However, they note the conveniences of Victorian civilisation. The female fairies suspect that the males may not hate the mortal world {{as much as they}} say, <b>and</b> <b>complain</b> of the dullness of life in Fairyland, and long to experience that wonderful, wicked world. Selene, the Fairy Queen, expresses a determination to go to Earth. The three males resist this and instead agree to return to the world themselves and ask the Fairy King (who is in England studying [...] "political economy", also known as [...] "spending a pound to save a penny") to send three mortals up to Fairyland, so that the fairies may find out what men are really like. While the female fairies wait for the three mortals, Selene explains why England has an advantage over other countries: it enjoys a [...] "popular government".|$|E
2500|$|There is no {{evidence}} which shows that King Henry himself participated in the campaign in person, {{but it is clear}} that his backing was enough to force King Alexander to recognize his younger brother's claims. This probably occurred without bloodshed. Years later, when David invaded England with a huge army composed almost entirely of Gaelic Scots, Ailred of Rievaulx has a Norman knight named Robert de Brus lament <b>and</b> <b>complain</b> to David about his betrayal of the Angli and Normanni, the English and Normans, whom he once relied upon. Among other things, the knight asserted:"Oh King, when thou didst demand from thy brother Alexander the part of the kingdom which the same brother [...] had bequeathed at his death didst obtain without bloodshed all that thou wouldst, through fear of us" [...] It was in this way, through a bloodless threat of force, that David gained his first territorial foothold within the area of modern Scotland. David's aggression seems to have inspired resentment amongst some native Scots. A recently rediscovered Gaelic quatrain from this period complains that: ...|$|E

And paramania is the joy of complaint, like if you're a pyromaniac — if you're a paramaniac, you love complaining about everything. I don't want to complain about anything, I want people to know that I'm happy doing what I'm doing.
