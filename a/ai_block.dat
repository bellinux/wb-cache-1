40|$|The {{majority}} of breast tumours express oestrogen receptor (ER) and {{are dependent on}} oestrogen (E 2) for their growth and survival. Endocrine therapy is the standard of care for this breast cancer subset and acts by targeting ER pathway in different ways: selective ER modulators compete with E 2 to bind ER (e. g. tamoxifen), selective ER downregulators promote ER degradation (e. g. fulvestrant) and aromatase inhibitors (<b>AI)</b> <b>block</b> E 2 biosynthesis. Despite the efficacy of these endocrine agents, {{a large proportion of}} women relapse with endocrine-resistant disease. In this study, we investigated the link between altered breast cancer metabolism and endocrine therapy resistance. We found that AI-resistance cells can adapt to metabolic stress and switch ad hoc between OXPHOS and glycolysis. In particular, we identified the miR- 155 /hexokinase- 2 (HK 2) axis as an important regulator of this tumour plasticity. In addition to central carbon metabolism, we found a deregulated node between miR- 23 b- 3 p and the amino acid transporter SLC 6 A 14 in endocrine therapy resistant cells, which leads to an impairment of amino acids metabolism in the resistant cells with subsequent activation of autophagy. Furthermore, the miRNA characterised have prognostic (miR- 155 and miR- 23 b- 3 p) and predictive (miR 155) value in ER positive breast cancer. These results suggest that high metabolic plasticity is involved in acquiring adaptive features that allow breast cancer cell survival even in the presence of endocrine therapy...|$|E

Therefore, specific and systemic treatment with anti- 5 -alpha reductase agents (such as finasteride or dutasteride) may preclude both HL on the scalp and male pattern hair growth {{in other parts of the}} body.

40|$|Because {{estrogen}} {{contributes to}} the promotion and progression of breast cancer, {{a greater understanding of}} the role of estrogen in breast cancer has led to therapeutic strategies targeting estrogen synthesis, the estrogen receptor, and intracellular signaling pathways. The enzyme aromatase catalyses the final step in estrogen biosynthesis and was identified as an attractive target for selective inhibition. Modern third-generation aromatase inhibitors (<b>AIs)</b> effectively <b>block</b> the production of estrogen without exerting effects on other steroidogenic pathways. The discovery of letrozole (Femara®) achieved the goal of discovering a highly potent and totally selective AI. Letrozole has greater potency than other AIs, including anastrozole, exemestane, formestane, and aminoglutethimide. Moreover, letrozole produces near complete inhibition of aromatase in peripheral tissues and is associated with greater suppression of estrogen than is achieved with other AIs. The potent anti-tumor effects of letrozole were demonstrated in several animal models. Studies with MCF- 7 Ca xenografts successfully predicted that letrozole would be clinically superior to the previous gold standard tamoxifen and also indicated that it may be more effective than other AIs.

Exemestane, a steroidal that belongs to the third-generation of AIs, is a mechanism-based inhibitor that binds covalently and irreversibly, inactivating and destabilizing aromatase. Since the biological effects of exemestane in breast cancer cells are not totally understood, its effects on cell viability, cell proliferation and mechanisms of cell death were studied in an ER-positive aromatase-overexpressing breast cancer cell line (MCF- 7 aro). The effects of 3 -methyladenine (3 -MA), an inhibitor of autophagy and of ZVAD-FMK, an apoptotic inhibitor, in exemestane treated cells were also investigated. Our results indicate that exemestane induces a strong inhibition in MCF- 7 aro cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, promoting a significant cell cycle arrest in G 0 /G 1 or in G 2 /M phases after 3 and 6 days of treatment, respectively.

Premenopausal breast cancer patients often choose tamoxifen (TAM), a selective oestrogen receptor modulator, as their first-line endocrine treatment. Clinical studies such as ATAC (Cuzick et al. 2010) and BIG 1 - 98 (Breast International Group (BIG) 1 - 98 Collaborative Group et al. 2005) have confirmed that the curative effect of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) in patients with breast cancer is superior to TAM. However, <b>AIs</b> can only <b>block</b> the synthesis of exogenous oestrogen outside the ovaries in women, e.g., by blocking the adrenal cortex or peripheral tissues (i.e., the liver, fat and muscle), to convert testosterone into oestradiol (E 2) and androstenedione into oestrone. Thus, AIs can only be used for patients with breast cancer with ovarian function failure. Prediction of ovarian function in premenopausal breast cancer patients with amenorrhoea after chemotherapy is important.|$|R

Simultaneous administration of estradiol- 3 -benzoate (E(2) B) via an Alzet pump during the Al: treatment period at a dose of 1 mu g/day could completely reverse the Al induced reduction in P- 4 secretion. The luteal cells of experimental rats depleted of E in vivo showed a significantly reduced response upon incubation with hCG or dbcAMP in vitro (P < 0. 05 and 0. 001, respectively).

For example, given a nonsingular pair of r. s. matrices S and T, which simultaneous block diagonalizations X′SX = diag(A 1,, Ak), X′TX = diag(B 1,, Bk) with dim Ai = dim Bi and X nonsingular are possible for 1 ⩽ k ⩽ n; and how well defined is a simultaneous block diagonalization for which k, the number of blocks, is maximal?

AII antibody was only 29 % as effective in neutralizing AI given intravenously as it was in neutralizing AII injected by the same route. Control plasma caused no change in the relative potencies of AI and AII. In a further series of experiments, AII antibody was significantly less effective in <b>blocking</b> intra-arterial <b>AI</b> than in <b>blocking</b> intravenous <b>AI.</b> The potency of intra-arterial AI, initially less than that of intravenous AI, became nearly twice that of intravenous AI after antibody administration, a result which could not occur if AI were inactive before lung transit. Thus, AI can elicit systemic pressor activity independently of pulmonary conversion to AII. However, since the intra-arterial AI responses were abolished by an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, the activity would appear to be mediated by peripheral conversion to AII rather than by an intrinsic action of the decapeptide. Both series of experiments suggest that the efficacy of AII antibody in abolishing the systemic pressor activity of AI is highly dependent on the site of conversion of the AI to AII. The occurrence of localized intramural conversion of AI to AII near arteriolar receptors in vivo may so minimize exposure of the liberated AII to circulating antibody as to render AII immunization an inefficient means of blocking endogenous pressor activity of the renin-angiotensin system...|$|R
40|$|In the U. S., 1 in 6 {{women will}} develop breast cancer. Major {{treatments}} {{for breast cancer}} are surgery, chemo-therapy, radiation and hormone therapy. The most widely used hormone therapy in clinic is a class of drugs called aromatase inhibitors (<b>AI)</b> that <b>block</b> {{the function of the}} enzyme aromatase [3]. Aromatase is the enzyme that converts androgen to estrogen, and blocking the aromatase pathway has been an effective treatment for hormone dependent breast cancers [2]. Hormone dependent breast cancer is {{the most common form of}} breast cancer in post menopausal women, and it is characterized by the overproduction of estrogen levels within the cancer cells. While AI treatment has been clinically effective at eradicating breast cancer, resistance to these therapies sometimes occurs, and it leads to relapse in many patients [2]. This is a great clinical problem. LBH 589 is a histone deacetylase inhibitor whose design upregulates gene expression. This drug was previously used to treat lymphoma, and it was well tolerated by patients in clinical trials [1]. Microarray analysis revealed LBH 589 actually downregulates some gene expression [1]. So, although this drug is safe for patients, the mechanism of its effectiveness remains a mystery. Our lab has developed cell lines resistant to third generation AIs such as Letrozole, Anastrozole, and Exemestane [2]. Our objective is to test whether LBH 589 is effective in inhibiting cell proliferation in AI resistant cell lines. The clinical significance of this research is great, and it will provide a potential solution to patients whose breast cancers have become resistant to AI therapy. Cells in triplicate were treated in 96 -well plates with LBH 589 and an MTT assay was preformed to track cell proliferation at baseline, 24, 48 and 72 hours after treatment. Cells treated with LBH 589 showed a dose dependent inhibitory cell proliferation response in all cell lines. Ana-R, an AI resistant breast cancer cell line, was most sensitive to the LBH 589 treatment. While LBH 589 effectively reduces cell proliferation in resistant cell lines, its effects are most potent in the Ana-R cell line. 1.)

40|$|Effects {{of various}} pollen types on the fruit growth and {{development}} in two maternal cultivars of Omani Date Palm were studied in the Northern Batinah region of the Sultanate Oman. Discrete stages in the development were identified, quantified and examined with regard to important variables including fruit set, weight, size, maturity, chemical composition, appearance and yield. Procedures were developed to compare across the different maternal cultivars and temperature environments. The pollen types were distinct in their effects, particularly as regards weight, time to maturity, ripening, sugar content, appearance and yield of certain consumable fruit stages. These effects were influenced by the female type and differential fruit set. True metaxenic and xenic effects were evidenced by excluding influences of fruit set. These were on fruit fresh weight, size, maturity and ripening in cv Khasab in 1996 and 1995 and in cv Khalas in 1996. Differences in cv Khalas in 1995 were {{due to differences in}} fruit set. Pollen effects could be measured in cv Khalas throughout fruit development, while they appeared in cv Khasab only in the later stages. Khori consistently induced the highest mature fruit fresh weight (14. 8 g in cv Khalas, 13. 0 g in cv Khasab) compared to Bahlani (12. 6 g and 12. 3 g, respectively and AI Arudsabba (12. 2 9 and 11. 1 g, respectively). However, differences in fruit set between pollen blocks in cv Khalas in 1995 caused the largest ripe fruit fresh weight (16. 1 g) in the <b>AI</b> Arudsabba <b>block</b> compared to Bahlani (14. 1 g) and Khori (13. 4 g). The effect of high fruit set (initial set was 49 % with Khori and 34 % with AI Arudsabba) in masking and modifying pollen effects was evident because AI Arudsabba induced about 40 % less fruit fresh weight than Khori in the initial stages of development. The response to applications of plant growth regulators was specific to the pollen type used. GA increased, by about 100 %, fruit fresh weight in AI Arudsabba pollinated Khalas fruits but reduced it to about 50 % in Khon pollinated ones. NAA caused the abscission of all unfertilized ovaries in Khon pollinated Khalas but not in those pollinated with AI Arudsabba. In the absence of syngamy physiological rather than hereditary causes were implied. Correlations between fruit set and fruit fresh weight did not exist in the early stages suggesting that the observed pollen effects were truly metaxenic or xenic. In the later stages clear and consistent negative correlations existed for the <b>AI</b> Arudsabba <b>block.</b> Probably in the other pollen blocks some mechanism compensated this control of one variable over the other. Late correlations for the Khori block in cv Khalas suggested that high fruit fresh weight induced fruit drop. The absence of pollen effects on late correlations in cv Khasab implied a genetic cause. The strong influence of fruit set on ripening (% ripe fruits) in Khori pOllinated bunches indicated a specifically strong influence exerted by fruit set over ripening. Time to physiological maturity was affected by pollen type only in cv Khalas where AI Arudsabba and Bahlani induced earlier maturity (7 days) than Khori. Khori pollinated fruits appeared to mature later in both female cvs except cv Khalas in 1995. Bahlani induced earlier maturity in both female cvs. Regression analysis between thermal time and fruit fresh weight provided evidence for the effects specific to Khori. As Bahlani induced the same early maturity in both female cvs. Ripening was most uniform in Bahlani pollinated bunches, but faster in Khori pollinated ones. Correlations of thermal time and ripeness indicated that the temperature regime has a strong influence (r= 0. 99) over ripening in Bahlani pollinated bunches. Early pollen effects were probably due to physiological mechanisms, probably hormonal activity, which could be attributed to pollen type and pollination. Late effects were under the influence of male x female interactions and were thought to be genetic. Bahlani consistently induced the highest fruit fresh weight and size in the early fruit stages, but Khori in the later stages. Only in cv Khasab was Bahlani in the later stages on par with Khori in this regard. The situation was similar for fruit and seed size. Compositional differences between pollen types were not reflected in those between the ovaries one day after pollination with different male types. This largely precluded the possibility that the early growth response was directly due to the mere addition of substances contributed by the pollen grains. Preliminary investigations indicated that pollen types were a priori distinct with regard to their biochemical composition and mineral content in that AI Arudsabba and Bahlani were similar and differed from Khori. Khori's pollen grains were largest (22 mum, less than 20 mum in other types) and its pollen tube growth the most uniform (CV 56 % compared to 80 - 110 % with other types), while Bahlani had the most vigorous pollen tube growth (tube length up to 220 JlI 1 lI 24 h). Khori contained more growth promoters, possibly GA, than AI Arudsabba. Khori brought about relatively stable bunch yields in cv Khalas (11 kg in 1996, 15 kg in 1995) and large (about 4 cm long), heavy and sweet fruits, but delayed maturity of the fruits (7 days in cv Khalas). AI Arudsabba produced a slightly higher cumulative yield (28 kg) of similar yield stability, but produced fruits of poor quality in regard to fruit size (about 3. 5 cm in cv Khalas), fresh weight and a low total sugar content (less than 40 % in Khalas, less than 50 % in Khasab). Bahlani had clear advantages, in that it induced sweet fruits, but produced the least stable yields of fruits (cv Khalas: 16 kg in 1996, 7 kg in 1995) with relatively low weight and small fruits...|$|R
