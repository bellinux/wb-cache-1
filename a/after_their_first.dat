5|$|Roddenberry's {{favorite}} for Riker was Jonathan Frakes, {{who went through}} seven auditions before claiming the role. Despite being the second choice of the casting team, he was hired <b>after</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> choice was unimpressive in his auditions.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> {{victory of}} the season, the Flyers were {{challenged}} by the Muncie Offers More AC. The game was labelled as the Muncie City Championship. Since {{most of the other}} local teams' seasons were finished, both Muncie teams hired as many as 20 players for the game. The field was muddy, which caused Offers More AC to fumble the ball several times. In the third quarter, the Flyers scored two touchdowns to give them a 14–0 lead going into the fourth quarter. The Flyers added 10 more points—a touchdown and a field goal—in the final quarter to win the Championship 24–0.|$|E

5|$|Buffalo {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} the International Bowl following their victory over then-undefeated Ball State in the 2008 MAC Championship Game. Although in past years the MAC champion had been invited to the Motor City Bowl, Buffalo preferred to go to the International Bowl due to Toronto being closer to the school than Detroit, the home of the Motor City Bowl. The game marked the first bowl for the Bulls <b>after</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> MAC Championship since moving to Division I-A and joining the MAC in 1999.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the declining}} {{prevalence}} of marriage, {{more than three-quarters}} of Americans will marry at least once in their lifetime. The average age for marriage for a male was 26.8 and 25.1 for a female. Americans are also likely to remarry <b>after</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> divorce. In 1990, 40% of all marriages were remarriages. All together one can conclude that while there is no prevalent average household arrangement, most Americans (the average Joe) will get married and divorced once with a considerable number of Americans remarrying at least once.|$|E

5|$|In 1808, Napoleon and Czar Alexander {{met at the}} Congress of Erfurt to {{preserve}} the Russo-French alliance.

After persuasion by the wife of manager Jerry Kerr, the colour would soon be adopted as the club's own in 1969 to give the club a brighter, more modern image.

5|$|In {{addition}} to a cash prize, {{the winner of the}} tournament is presented with a distinctive green jacket, formally awarded since 1949, and informally acquired by the champions for many years before that. The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon {{after the end of the}} tournament, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the spectators. Winners keep their jacket for the first year <b>after</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they visit. The tradition began in 1949, when Sam Snead won his first of three Masters titles.|$|E
