The taxes of the municipalities was increased by 3 percentage points from 1 January 2007. These 3 percent are for patient care, which was previously a part of the county tax. The counties were financed both through their own county tax and in addition through block grants from central government.|$|E

This would present governments with hard choices between higher taxes, including a possible reweighing of tax from earnings to consumption, and a reduced government role in providing health care. However, recent studies in some countries demonstrate the dramatic rising costs of health care are more attributable to rising drug and doctor costs, and higher use of diagnostic testing by all age groups, and not to the ageing population as is often claimed.|$|E

With a concrete superstructure and wood roof and supporting beams, the school resembles a ski lodge.

Technology was a key <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure,</b> with BC Tel (now Telus) and SD45 investing in hundreds of kilometres of fibreoptic cable and extensive audio-visual networking equipment provided by Dynacom.

5000|$|One <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> {{that soon}} became a matter of {{particular}} concern to Asher was the large and rising cost of payments to independent promotion agents, and Asher calculated that this little-known facet of the company's operation was by then costing CBS alone around $10 million annually. For most of their history, music publishers and record labels had long used [...] "song pluggers", freelance promotions agents who were hired on a casual basis to promote and sell new sheet music - and later, new record releases - to department and music stores, and radio station program directors. For many years {{this had been a}} relatively low-cost operation, but through the late 1960s and early 1970s, the combination of increasing competition between record labels, the enormous increase in the volume of new records, and the development of the restrictive Top 40 radio programming format meant that by the mid-1970s record labels were finding it increasingly difficult to get new releases placed into radio station playlists by their house marketing staff, and the American labels began to rely more and more heavily on a small group of powerful and influential independent promoters.|$|E
5000|$|As David A. Rochefort, a Northeastern University professor, points outs, “the most {{significant}} {{function in the}} hidden welfare state is income security, accounting for roughly half of all expenditures, and {{the single most important}} program of this tax supports employer-provided pensions. Exclusion of employers' health insurance contributions from corporate taxation represents another leading <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> that when combined with retirement initiatives, adds up to an enormous public subsidy for employers and their workers." [...] These large subsidies on employer benefits are one reason affluent citizens tend to benefit from the hidden welfare state the most. These plans and benefits are usually available in larger companies, unionized companies, and better paying occupations. Also, tax expenditures often benefit activities that the less affluent can not afford to engage in, such as owning a home. The majority of tax expenditures go to people who earn more than the median income. Who benefits from the visible welfare state seems to be more equal; most benefits of the visible welfare state go to people with average income. Christopher Howard's research reveals that one quarter of direct spending goes to public assistance and three-quarter goes to social insurance and that the visible welfare state serves a far greater proportion of individuals below the poverty line than does the hidden welfare. Only about 5 percent of tax expenditures are targeted at people at or near the poverty line. Many Americans are aware of the national housing policies that help the poor through subsidized rent or public housing, however, it is misleading to think of U.S. housing programs as small and only targeted at the poor. Many middle and upper-class people benefit from housing programs because most housing programs are administered through the tax code rather than appropriations. The U.S. government spends twice as much on housing tax expenditures as on traditional housing programs. [...] As Thomas Shapiro, author of The Hidden Cost of Being African-American, points out, the fact that most Americans are not aware of the many housing tax expenditures that the government provides shows that these programs are [...] "ingrained and taken for granted by home owner subsidies have become, as opposed to the intense annual scrutiny programs assisting needy families receive." ...|$|E

It illustrates how political science theories can provide scholars with useful insights into the way EU policy evaluation is carried out. It develops a toolkit for analyzing real-world approaches to evaluation and then applies it to three separate Cohesion Policy programmes.

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{understand}} participation levels in sport across socio-demographic groups, {{specifically for the}} period 2008 - 14, {{in the context of}} austerity measures taken by central government resulting in local authority income and expenditure reductions. Participation levels over time were analysed using data from the Active People Survey (APS) which was the preferred method for measuring participation by Sport England until its replacement in 2015. Budgetary constraints in local authorities, have subsequently resulted in an expenditure decrease for non-discretionary services including ‘sport development and community recreation’. This <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> forms one component of sport-related services and primarily focuses on raising participation in ‘hard-to-reach’ groups. The study found policy goals associated with raising and widening participation were not met to any significant degree between 2008 and 2014 as participation levels have changed little for lower-income ‘hard-to-reach’ groups. It is claimed that this outcome is in part due to austerity measures impacting on local authority expenditure. This study has implications for policy-makers and practitioners as it illustrates both the challenges faced in setting and delivering policy aimed at raising participation levels in ‘hard-to-reach’ groups, particularly in the context of austerity, and the difficulties associated with measuring participation...|$|E
