25|$|Later in the day, {{the crew}} {{finished}} their final preparations for Atlantis’s planned landing. Commander Ferguson and Pilot Hurley practiced landing procedures {{with a video}} game-like simulator, the Portable Inflight Landing Operations Trainer (PILOT). At 6:15 UTC, Ferguson, Hurley and Walheim powered {{up one of the}} APUs to conduct OPS-8 activities. This process verified the functionality of Atlantiss flight control surfaces, actuating the rudder, speed brakes, wing and tail body flaps which guided the shuttle through the atmosphere. They then stowed the Ku-Band antenna at 10:34 a.m. EDT <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|E
500|$|Booth had {{assigned}} George Atzerodt to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson, who {{was staying}} at the Kirkwood House in Washington. Atzerodt {{was to go to}} Johnson's room at 10:15p.m. and shoot him. On April 14 Atzerodt rented the room directly above Johnson's; the next day he arrived there at the appointed time and, carrying a gun and knife, went to the bar downstairs, where he asked the bartender about Johnson's character and behavior. [...] He eventually became drunk and wandered off through the streets, tossing his knife away at some point. He {{made his way to the}} Pennsylvania House Hotel by 2 a.m., where he obtained a room <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|E
500|$|On September 18, Garfield asked A.F. Rockwell, a friend, if {{he would}} have a place in history. Rockwell assured him he would, and told Garfield he had much work still before him. But his {{response}} was, [...] "No, my work is done." [...] The following day, Garfield, by then also suffering from pneumonia and heart pains, marveled that he could not pick up a glass despite feeling well, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> without discomfort. He awoke that evening around 10:15 pm with great pain in his chest. The attendant watching him sent for Bliss, who found him unconscious. Despite efforts to revive him, Garfield never awoke, and died at 10:35 pm that evening. Learning from a reporter of Garfield's death, Arthur took the presidential oath of [...] office administered by New York Supreme Court Justice John R. Brady.|$|E
60|$|The girl assures {{him that}} there is no mistake about the matter at all. There is the bed, made {{according}} to German notions of how a bed should be made. He can {{make the best of it}} <b>and</b> try <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> upon it, or he can be sulky <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> on the floor.|$|R

500|$|ZANU and ZAPU {{announced}} on 9 October {{that they would}} attend this conference and any thereafter as a joint [...] "Patriotic Front" [...] (PF), including members of both parties under a combined leadership. Kaunda and Nyerere welcomed the new negotiations, but with the Soviet Union proposing that they once again alter their line, the talks were delayed indefinitely. In an attempt to encourage the other parties to travel to Switzerland, British mediator Ivor Richard asked the Rhodesian delegation to hasten their arrival, which they did, leaving Salisbury on 20 October 1976. Richard himself did not arrive until two days later. Some of the guerrillas arriving for the conference from the heat of Mozambique were unprepared for the Swiss winter: Rex Nhongo, for example, felt so cold that he turned every heating appliance in his room, including the stove, to maximum <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> When the room caught fire, {{he was forced to}} jump from the balcony in his pyjamas.|$|E
500|$|Seventeen {{days after}} his release from Kingston Penitentiary, {{on the evening of}} 25 June 1966, Lamb {{discovered}} a shotgun in his uncle's house. He took the weapon and left the house shortly before 22:00 Eastern Time, then walked a single block north along Ford Boulevard and hid behind a tree outside number 1872. Six young people—Edith Chaykoski, 20, her 22-year-old brother Kenneth, his wife and three friends, 21-year-old Andrew Woloch, Vincent Franco and Don Mulesa—were heading south from 1635 Ford Boulevard {{on their way to a}} bus stop on Tecumseh Road when they approached the tree behind which Lamb was hiding at about 22:15. Lamb suddenly stepped out in front of the strangers, pointed the shotgun at them and said [...] "Stop. Put up your hands!" [...] When Edith Chaykoski stepped forward, towards Lamb, he shot her in the abdomen. Woloch then moved and was hit in the stomach by a second shot, which also wounded Kenneth Chaykoski. Lamb then ran across the street to 1867 Ford Boulevard and fired on a girl whose silhouette he had spotted in a side doorway of the house; his target, 19-year-old Grace Dunlop, was injured. As law enforcement and medical assistance were summoned, Lamb strolled away and walked two blocks before knocking on a door, which he had seemingly chosen at random. Pointing the shotgun at the elderly lady who lived there, Ann Heaton, he threatened to kill her. When Heaton cried out to her husband Forrest to phone the police, Lamb fled, throwing the shotgun over the old couple's fence into a field. He returned to the Hesketh house <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Later {{everyone}} was tired <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> apart from Flidhais and Bricne. He sang to Flidhais: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'I {{wish it were}} {{possible}} to take some magic draught <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> {{for the next three}} months--and then waken to find Armageddon over,' said mother, almost impatiently.|$|R
6000|$|... "Must {{have been}} the storm," [...] he told himself, and was about <b>to</b> turn over <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> {{when he heard a}} gun-shot from the {{direction}} of the barn.|$|R
2500|$|Ladany {{finished}} his race in 19th place, {{with a time}} of 4 hours, 24 minutes, and 38 seconds. Asked how he felt, he replied: [...] "Arrogant because of what the Germans did to me; proud because I am a Jew". He then returned to the athletes' Olympic Village <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Gavin and Star Arvizo {{testified that}} Jackson {{introduced}} them to pornography. Star described {{a time when}} he, his brother, Frank Tyson, and Michael Jackson had looked at [...] "pornography sites" [...] on Gavin's computer. The pictures were of naked women, and Jackson had allegedly whispered to his sleeping son, [...] "you're missing some pussy," [...] before they all watched The Simpsons <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> Star also testified to twice looking through adult magazines with Gavin, Jackson, and Aldo Cascio. He identified {{a picture of a}} particular Barely Legal magazine that he said Jackson showed the boys, when Mesereau pointed out that the magazine had not been published until August 2003—five months after the Arvizos had left Neverland. Fingerprints of Gavin and Michael were found on a particular magazine, but it was only analyzed for fingerprints after the 2004 grand jury proceeding when Gavin handled the magazine without gloves.|$|E
2500|$|In 1957, when Bosworth's family {{thought it}} was his time to go, Branham visited his bedside, prayed with him, and was greatly {{encouraged}} by his testimony. [...] Bosworth recovered his strength {{and it was not}} until several months later, in 1958, when he eventually died, again with an outstanding testimony. [...] According to his son's description in the 9th edition of [...] "Christ the Healer", the family was gathered around Bosworth's bedside talking, laughing, and singing about three weeks after Bosworth was in bed full-time, [...] Bosworth then looked up, never saw the family members present, and began [...] "to greet and hug people - he was enraptured ... He did this for several hours", then with {{a smile on his face}} he laid back <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> [...] When Bosworth died, Branham was asked by the family to come to preach his funeral but was unable to attend because he was in the middle of a campaign.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, don't call her, don't tell her. I {{shall be}} better soon. Lie {{down here and}} 'poor' my head. I'll be quiet <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> indeed I will." ...|$|R
