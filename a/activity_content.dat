The use of a small ROI size (40 % of the large ROI size, which covered the entire sphere) showed a 15 % improvement in the recovery of the true activity.

40|$|Different {{organs of}} maize {{seedlings}} {{are known to}} contain different complements of NADH and NAD(P) H nitrate reductase (NR) activity. The study of the genetic programming that gives rise to such differences can be initiated by looking for genetic variants exhibiting different patterns of distribution of the above enzymes. We demonstrate in this work that scutella of very young maize seedlings contain NADH NR almost exclusively and that this activity is gradually replaced, as the seedling ages, with NAD(P) H NR. Leaves in the seedlings contain exclusively the NADH NR activity. A genetic variant is described that contains much reduced levels of NAD(P) H NR activity but not of NADH NR activity in the scutellum. This same variant exhibits a relatively low level of NAD(P) H NR but normal NADH NR activity in seedling root tips. These observations suggest that the genetic program used to specify the scutellar complement of NR activity shares some common components with the genetic program {{used to determine the}} young root tip complement of NR activities. Parts of regenerating callus at different stages of differentiation were examined to determine when the differences in NR complement begin to appear. The same pattern of NADH NR and NAD(P) H NR activities was found in unorganized as well as in organized callus, in recognizable root-like and even in green shoot-like material, both activities being present in all these tissues. An examination of the NR complement in different organs of a number of siblings originating from a cross involving transposon Mu-containing parents and having different levels of leaf NADH NR activity shows that the leaf NADH NR <b>activity</b> <b>content</b> and the scutellum NAD(P) H NR <b>activity</b> <b>content</b> are relatively independent of each other, indicating that the genetic programs specifying the NR content of these organs are not tightly coupled, if at all...|$|E

However, bulk transplants are still performed when assessing the HSC potential of early embryonic hematopoietic tissues such as the aorta-gonad mesonephros (AGM) due to very low HSC <b>activity</b> <b>content</b> early in development. Intra-bone marrow transplantation (IBMT) {{has emerged as a}} superior administration route over intravenous (IV) transplantation for assessing the reconstituting ability of human HSCs in the xenotransplant setting since it bypasses the requirement for homing to the BM. In this study, we compared the ability of IBMT and IV administration of embryonic day 11. 5 AGM-derived cells to reconstitute the hematopoietic system of myeloablated recipients. IBMT resulted in higher levels of AGM HSC long-term multilineage engraftment in the peripheral blood, BM, spleen, and thymus of primary and secondary recipients, and in limiting dilution experiments. The administration route did not skew the multilineage contribution pattern, but IBMT conferred higher Lineage(-) Sca- 1 (+) c-kit(+) long-term engraftment, in line with the superior IBMT reconstitution. Therefore, IBMT represents a superior administration route to detect HSC activity from developmentally early sources with limited HSC <b>activity</b> <b>content,</b> such as the AGM.
