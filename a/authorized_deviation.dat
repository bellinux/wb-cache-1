40|$|Background: Computerized {{record and}} verify systems (RVS) have been {{introduced}} to improve the precision of radiation treatment delivery. These systems prevent the delivery of ionizing radiations when the settings of the treatment machine do not match the intended parameters within some maximal <b>authorized</b> <b>deviation.</b> Purpose: To assess the potential alteration of the frequency of errors {{associated with the use}} of RVS during radiation treatment delivery. Materials and methods: The software of the RVS was altered in order to record the settings actually used for radiation treatment delivery whereas the verification function was suppressed. At the end of the study period, the settings used during daily administration of radiation treatment were compared to the parameters recorded in the RVS using the computer. They were also compared with the planned ones written in the patient treatment chart. Results: Out of the 147 476 parameters examined during the study period, 678 (0. 46 %) were set erroneously. At least one error occurred in 628 (3. 22 %) of the 19 512 treated fields. An erroneous parameter was introduced in the RVS memory in 22 (1. 17 %) of the 1885 fields. Conclusions: RVS has the potential to improve precision of radiation treatment delivery by detecting a significant number of setting errors. However, excessive confidence in RVS could lead to repeated errors as there is a potential for the entry of erroneous parameters into the RVS memory. Peer reviewe...|$|E
50|$|TennCare is {{the state}} Medicaid program in the U.S. state of Tennessee. TennCare was {{established}} in 1994 under a federal waiver that <b>authorized</b> <b>deviations</b> from the standard Medicaid rules. It was the first state Medicaid program to enroll all Medicaid recipients in managed care. When first implemented, it also offered health insurance to other residents {{who did not have}} other insurance. Over time, the non-Medicaid component of the program was significantly reduced.|$|R
40|$|Federal {{district}} {{courts have}} viewed the Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990 as {{a mandate to}} adopt procedural rules inconsistent with existing law. But in this article, Professor Robel argues that the Act neither compels nor <b>authorizes</b> such local <b>deviations.</b> Citing examples from reforms underway in district courts nationwide, Professor Robel contends that courts 2 ̆ 7 assertions of broad rulemaking authority rest on a misreading of the Act and of the compromise between Congress and the judiciary that led to its passage. Professor Robel cautions {{that the goal of}} national uniformity underlying the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure should not be compromised lightly. However, she argues that, while probably unwise, the Civil Justice Reform Act was within Congress 2 ̆ 7 con- stitutional power to enact. She concludes by urging rulemakers to more care- fully consider {{the costs and benefits of}} local rules...|$|R
