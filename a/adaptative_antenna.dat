40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the most recent}} contributions of the italian research {{to the field of}} the spatial distribution of rainfall intensity, with particular regard to the impact of the rain structure on the design of the modern transmission systems (both TLC and broadcasting). Considering the foreseen utilization of advanced techniques such as on-board resurce sharing, space or route diversity, <b>adaptative</b> <b>antenna</b> footprint etc. the problem of describing rain over a wide range of spatial scales has become nowadays of primary importance and models in this field are receiving particular attention...|$|E

In the previous years, several improvements on printed circuits and an increasement in the multi-functionality of mobile devices have taken place, and thus, 3 G/ 4 G, wireless networks, Bluetooth or Digital Television {{have been included in}} these devices. Since each of these communications formats works at a di fferent frequency, an antenna installation for every wavelength turns necessary, unless a multiple frequency <b>adaptative</b> <b>antenna</b> can be installed on these devices. Multiple frequency manufacturing methods require integrated elements inside the antenna itself, so that it can radiate at di fferent wavelengths. The aim is to use an antenna that can reshape itself, consequently obtaining a valid frequency bandwidth where the antenna can operate correctly. The simplest choice is to change the antenna dimmensions, which means resize the device where the antenna is installed depending on the application and the needed frequency. This method may present several problems when light, small and variable frequency antennas are used. A potential way to solve this problem is to create recon figurable antennas through arti ficial muscles instead of actuators. Thereby, an antenna reshape and resize becomes possible. Moreover, if this structure is implemented onto polymers, a reconfi gurable antena installation in mobile devices is also possible. Ingenier√≠a de Sistemas de Comunicacione...|$|E
