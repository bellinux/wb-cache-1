5|$|In 1994, {{an unusual}} form of <b>asymmetric</b> {{occipital}} condylar dysplasia {{was found in}} two Jacob lambs; a possible link to the multi-horn trait has been suggested.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} to mimic this asymmetry in the laboratory in model bilayer systems. Certain types of very small artificial vesicle will automatically make themselves slightly <b>asymmetric,</b> although the mechanism by which this asymmetry is generated {{is very different from}} that in cells. By utilizing two different monolayers in Langmuir-Blodgett deposition or a combination of Langmuir-Blodgett and vesicle rupture deposition it is also possible to synthesize an <b>asymmetric</b> planar bilayer. This asymmetry may be lost over time as lipids in supported bilayers can be prone to flip-flop.|$|E
5|$|On 7 October 1964, Vulcan B.2 XM601 crashed during {{overshoot}} from an <b>asymmetric</b> power practice approach at Coningsby. The copilot had executed the <b>asymmetric</b> {{power approach}} with two engines producing thrust and two at idle. He was being checked by the Squadron Commander, who was {{unfamiliar with the}} aircraft. When he commenced the overshoot the copilot moved all the throttles to full power. The engines that had been producing power reached full power more quickly than the engines at idle and the resultant <b>asymmetric</b> thrust exceeded the available rudder authority, causing the aircraft to spin and crash. All the crew perished.|$|E

5|$|HDMI is {{backward}} compatible with single-link Digital Visual Interface digital video (DVI-D or DVI-I, but not DVI-A). No signal conversion is required when an adapter or <b>asymmetric</b> cable is used, {{so there is}} no loss of video quality.|$|E
5|$|In {{health care}} (17% of GDP), the {{problems}} of <b>asymmetric</b> information and moral hazard mean that increased spending results in little or no improvement in health outcomes. A similar result is observed in education, 6% of GDP, where outcomes have not improved in the last 40 years.|$|E
5|$|Iridium {{complexes}} {{are being}} investigated as catalysts for <b>asymmetric</b> hydrogenation. These catalysts {{have been used}} in the synthesis of natural products and able to hydrogenate certain difficult substrates, such as unfunctionalized alkenes, enantioselectively (generating only one of the two possible enantiomers).|$|E
5|$|Several methods {{exist to}} {{synthesize}} amino acids. One {{of the oldest}} methods begins with the bromination at the α-carbon of a carboxylic acid. Nucleophilic substitution with ammonia then converts the alkyl bromide to the amino acid. In alternative fashion, the Strecker amino acid synthesis involves the treatment of an aldehyde with potassium cyanide and ammonia, this produces an α-amino nitrile as an intermediate. Hydrolysis of the nitrile in acid then yields a α-amino acid. Using ammonia or ammonium salts in this reaction gives unsubstituted amino acids, whereas substituting primary and secondary amines will yield substituted amino acids. Likewise, using ketones, instead of aldehydes, gives α,α-disubstituted amino acids. The classical synthesis gives racemic mixtures of α-amino acids as products, but several alternative procedures using <b>asymmetric</b> auxiliaries or <b>asymmetric</b> catalysts have been developed.|$|E
5|$|The <b>asymmetric</b> gaseous envelope, another cooler region, extends {{for several}} radii (~10–40AU) from the photosphere. It is enriched in oxygen and {{especially}} in nitrogen relative to carbon. These composition anomalies are likely caused by contamination by CNO-processed material {{from the inside of}} Betelgeuse.|$|E
5|$|The first chiral Lewis acid {{promoted}} <b>asymmetric</b> Nazarov cyclization {{was reported}} by Varinder Aggarwal and utilized copper (II) bisoxazoline ligand complexes with up to 98% ee. The enantiomeric excess was unaffected by use of 50mol% of the copper complex but the yield was significantly decreased.|$|E
5|$|Tius has {{additionally}} {{developed a}} camphor-based auxiliary for achiral allenes that was {{employed in the}} first <b>asymmetric</b> synthesis of roseophilin. The key step employs an unusual mixture of hexafluoro-2-propanol and trifluoroethanol as solvent.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{has found}} many {{applications}} as catalyst in organic synthesis including <b>asymmetric</b> synthesis, being cheap and easily available alternative to precious metal complexes. The results (yield and ee) obtained with chiral zinc catalysts {{are comparable to}} those achieved with palladium, ruthenium, iridium and others, and zinc becomes metal catalyst of choice.|$|E
25|$|Synapses may be {{described}} as symmetric or <b>asymmetric.</b> When examined under an electron microscope, <b>asymmetric</b> synapses are characterized by rounded vesicles in the presynaptic cell, and a prominent postsynaptic density. <b>Asymmetric</b> synapses are typically excitatory. Symmetric synapses in contrast have flattened or elongated vesicles, and do not contain a prominent postsynaptic density. Symmetric synapses are typically inhibitory.|$|E
25|$|In most cases, the {{distance}} between two nodes in the TSP network is the same in both directions. The case where {{the distance}} from A to B is not equal to the distance from B to A is called <b>asymmetric</b> TSP. A practical application of an <b>asymmetric</b> TSP is route optimization using street-level routing (which is made <b>asymmetric</b> by one-way streets, slip-roads, motorways, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Aldehydes or ketones {{are reduced}} with sodium {{borohydride}} or lithium aluminium hydride (after an acidic workup). Another reduction by aluminiumisopropylates is the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction. Noyori <b>asymmetric</b> hydrogenation is the <b>asymmetric</b> reduction of β-keto-esters.|$|E
25|$|Chiral {{phosphine}} ligands are {{the source}} of chirality in most <b>asymmetric</b> hydrogenation catalysts. Of these the BINAP ligand is perhaps the best-known, {{as a result of its}} Nobel Prize-winning application in the Noyori <b>asymmetric</b> hydrogenation.|$|E
25|$|The {{space group}} of a crystal is a {{mathematical}} {{description of the}} symmetry inherent in the structure. The motif of the crystal structure is given by the <b>asymmetric</b> unit, a minimal subset of the unit cell contents. The unit cell contents can be fully reconstructed via the symmetry operations of the space group on the <b>asymmetric</b> unit. Visualization interfaces usually allow for switching between <b>asymmetric</b> unit and full structure representations.|$|E
25|$|Metal {{complexes}} incorporating bis(oxazoline) ligands {{are effective}} {{for a wide}} range of <b>asymmetric</b> catalytic transformations and have been the subject of numerous literature reviews.-Symmetric chiral bis(oxazoline)–metal complexes in catalytic <b>asymmetric</b> synthesis|journal=Tetrahedron: Asymmetry|year=1998|volume=9|issue=1|pages=1–45|doi=10.1016/S0957-4166(97)00593-4|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957416697005934}}-Symmetric Chiral Bis(oxazoline) Ligands in <b>Asymmetric</b> Catalysis|journal=Chemical Reviews|date=9 November 2011|volume=111|issue=11|pages=PR284–PR437|doi=10.1021/cr100339a|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cr100339a}} The neutral character of bis(oxazoline)s makes them well suited to use with noble metals, with copper complexes being particularly common. Their most important and commonly used applications are in carbon–carbon bond forming reactions.|$|E
25|$|The atom {{positions}} {{within the}} unit cell {{can be calculated}} through application of symmetry operations to the <b>asymmetric</b> unit. The <b>asymmetric</b> unit refers to the smallest possible occupation of space within the unit cell. This does not, however imply that {{the entirety of the}} <b>asymmetric</b> unit must lie within the boundaries of the unit cell. Symmetric transformations of atom positions are calculated from the space group of the crystal structure, and this is usually a black box operation performed by computer programs. However, manual calculation of the atomic positions within the unit cell can be performed from the <b>asymmetric</b> unit, through the application of the symmetry operators described within the International Tables for Crystallography: Volume A.|$|E
25|$|In organic {{synthesis}} OsO4 {{is widely used}} to oxidise alkenes to the vicinal diols, adding two hydroxyl groups at the same side (syn addition). See reaction and mechanism above. This reaction has been made both catalytic (Upjohn dihydroxylation) and <b>asymmetric</b> (Sharpless <b>asymmetric</b> dihydroxylation).|$|E
25|$|Homogeneous {{catalysts}} {{are often}} chelated complexes. A typical {{example is the}} ruthenium(II) chloride chelated with BINAP (a bidentate phosphine) used in e.g. Noyori <b>asymmetric</b> hydrogenation and <b>asymmetric</b> isomerization. The latter has the practical use of manufacture of synthetic (–)-menthol.|$|E
25|$|Known {{mechanisms}} {{for the production}} of non-racemic mixtures from racemic starting materials include: <b>asymmetric</b> physical laws, such as the electroweak interaction; <b>asymmetric</b> environments, such as those caused by circularly polarized light, quartz crystals, or the Earth's rotation; and statistical fluctuations during racemic synthesis. Once established, chirality would be selected for. A small enantiomeric excess can be amplified into a large one by <b>asymmetric</b> autocatalysis, such as in the Soai reaction. In <b>asymmetric</b> autocatalysis, the catalyst is a chiral molecule, which means that a chiral molecule is catalysing its own production. An initial enantiomeric excess, such as can be produced by polarized light, then allows the more abundant enantiomer to outcompete the other.|$|E
25|$|Solving an <b>asymmetric</b> TSP graph can be {{somewhat}} complex. The {{following is a}} 3×3 matrix containing all possible path weights between the nodes A, B and C. One option is to turn an <b>asymmetric</b> matrix of size N into a symmetric matrix of size 2N.|$|E
25|$|Despite these {{advances}} in the <b>asymmetric</b> hydrogenation of protected indoles, considerable operational simplicity can be gained by removing the protecting group altogether. This has been achieved with catalytic systems utilizing Brønsted acids to activate the indole. The initial system used a Pd(TFA)2/H8-BINAP system to achieve the enantioselective cis-hydrogenation of 2,3- and 2-substituted indoles with high yield and excellent ee. A similar process, where sequential Friedel-Crafts alkylation and <b>asymmetric</b> hydrogenation occur in one pot, allow <b>asymmetric</b> 2,3-substituted indolines to be selectively prepared from 2-substituted indoles in similarly high yields and ee.|$|E
25|$|A strict {{partial order}} is irreflexive, transitive, and <b>asymmetric.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Asymmetric</b> allylboration {{demonstrates}} another useful {{application of}} organoboranes in carbon–carbon bond formation. In this example from Nicolaou's {{synthesis of the}} epothilones, <b>asymmetric</b> allylboration (using an allylborane derived from chiral alpha-pinene) is {{used in conjunction with}} TBS protection and ozonolysis. Overall, this provides a two-carbon homologation sequence that delivers the required acetogenin sequence.|$|E
