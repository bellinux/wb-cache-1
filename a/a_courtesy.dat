5|$|Not trusting Có, Diệm put a Catholic loyalist, Colonel Phát, {{in command}} of the 7th Division on 31 October. According to tradition, Phát had to pay the corps {{commander}} <b>a</b> <b>courtesy</b> visit before assuming control. Đính refused to see Phát and told him to come back on Friday at 14:00, by which time the coup had already been scheduled to start. In the meantime, Đính had Đôn sign a counter-order transferring command of the 7th Division to Có. The next day, Có took the division's incumbent officers prisoner and used the unit to block loyalists from storming the capital from the south.|$|E
5|$|The Raiders {{declined}} to allow New York reporters to watch practices, <b>a</b> <b>courtesy</b> Ewbank extended to Oakland pressmen. Raiders assistant coach (later head coach) John Madden {{was responsible for}} the exchange of game films with upcoming opponents; he sent the films to the Jets through Chicago so they would arrive a day or two late, reasoning that Davis, not he, would be blamed for the delay. Ewbank blamed Davis for heavily watering the Coliseum field to slow the Jets' speedy receivers, a tactic the Oakland co-owner credited to Madden.|$|E

5|$|By late 1963, Diệm knew a coup was brewing {{and that}} the 7th Division at Mỹ Tho outside Saigon might be involved. As {{it was close to}} the capital, it would {{play a crucial role in}} either attacking or {{defending}} Diệm, or blocking outlying units from entering the city. Diệm put Phát in command of the 7th Division on 31 October. According to tradition, Phát had to pay the corps commander <b>a</b> <b>courtesy</b> visit before assuming control of the division. However, General Tôn Thất Đính, commander of the III Corps was part of the plot and deliberately refused to see Phát and told him to come back at 14:00 the following day, by which time the coup had already been scheduled to start. In the meantime, Đính had General Trần Văn Đôn sign a counter-order transferring command of the 7th Division to his deputy and co-conspirator Nguyễn Hữu Có.|$|E
5|$|President James A. Garfield died {{four days}} before they arrived back in the United States, and Kalākaua paid <b>a</b> <b>courtesy</b> call to newly inaugurated President Chester A. Arthur at the White House in Washington, D.C. There were no public or private {{appearances}} for the King in New York, only a day at Coney Island. Before leaving the eastern US, the King met with Thomas Edison to have a demonstration of electric lights, and visited Virginia's Fort Monroe. He toured Hampton Normal and Agricultural School, and shopped for horses in Kentucky. The royal party boarded a train to California, where they were house guests of Claus Spreckels at his estate in Aptos (near Santa Cruz), and had {{a few days of}} seeing the sights in the area before sailing back to Hawaii. Kalākaua was successful in jump-starting new immigration, with the first transplants arriving in Hawaii less than a year later. In the years that followed, he began emulating the lifestyles of European royalty with expensive furnishings in Iolani Palace, a public coronation of himself, and a two-week public celebration of his birthday.|$|E

5|$|Trans Polar made a {{demonstration}} trip to Stockholm on 13 June 1970—legal {{because it was}} without paying customers. The airline applied for permission to operate out of Sweden, but this {{was rejected by the}} Swedish Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) and appeals were rejected by the Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and Communications. The reason was that it lacked a permanent organization, did not have sufficient experience in large-scale charter operations and could not document that its charter operations would be based on their own resources. Despite the lack of permission, Trans Polar sub-chartered a round trip from Stockholm to London on 28 June. It then operated four flights from Stockholm to Rhodes, Palma de Mallorca and London between 4 and 6 July. Trans Polar claimed that they were flying courtesy trips and that the passengers had agreed to be compensated the part of the package trip which would have been paid to Trans Polar. The arguments were rejected by the CAA, who stated that this was a typical post-excuse and that in case of <b>a</b> <b>courtesy</b> trip the airline should not be collecting the fare in the first place. The incident was investigated by both Norwegian and Swedish police.|$|E
