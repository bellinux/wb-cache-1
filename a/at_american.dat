5|$|Jones was a {{four-year}} letterman in basketball <b>at</b> <b>American</b> High School in Hialeah, Florida. He averaged 25.2 points, 12 rebounds, 2.5 assists, 2 steals, and 6 blocks per game his senior season, earning First-team All-State and First-team All-Dade honors. He was also named the Class 6A Player of the Year and the Miami Herald Boys' Basketball Player of the Year. Jones {{was the team}} MVP his junior and senior years and once blocked 16 shots in one game.|$|E
5|$|There {{are both}} {{junior and senior}} fields for the {{competition}}, and the competition takes place the Friday prior to the <b>AT</b> <b>American</b> Cup, which occurs on the next day, Saturday. The incentive of the competition is to give pre-elite athletes the experience and opportunity to compete on a raised podium surface {{as well as in}} a large arena, which is not the norm for average USAG Optional competitions.|$|E
5|$|Washington was not {{a highly}} coveted player coming {{out of high school}} and barely got into college on an {{athletic}} scholarship. He averaged a mere four points per game (ppg) during his senior season of high school. He improved rapidly once <b>at</b> <b>American</b> University, and became one of only seven players in NCAA history to average 20 points and 20 rebounds throughout the course of their career.|$|E

5|$|While <b>at</b> <b>American</b> {{universities}} in early 1933, he undertook his third two-month visiting professorship at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. He {{and his wife}} Elsa returned to Belgium by ship in March, and during the trip they learned that their cottage was raided by the Nazis and his personal sailboat confiscated. Upon landing in Antwerp on 28 March, he immediately went to the German consulate and surrendered his passport, formally renouncing his German citizenship. The Nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a Hitler Youth camp.|$|E
5|$|After the crisis, superpower {{relations}} improved, as Kennedy gave a conciliatory speech <b>at</b> <b>American</b> University on 10 June 1963, {{recognizing the}} Soviet people's suffering during World War II, and paying tribute to their achievements. Khrushchev called the speech the best by a U.S. president since Franklin Roosevelt, and, in July, negotiated a {{test ban treaty}} with U.S. negotiator Averell Harriman and with Lord Hailsham of the United Kingdom. Plans for a second Khrushchev-Kennedy summit were dashed by the U.S. President's assassination in November 1963. The new U.S. President, Lyndon Johnson, hoped for continued improved relations but was distracted by other issues and had little opportunity to develop a relationship with Khrushchev before the premier was ousted.|$|E
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{are rarely}} kept in captivity, though they breed easily. In 1989, the Duke Lemur Center held more than 70% of the captive {{population}} (45 of 62individuals). At the time, the DLC was coordinating a captive breeding program for Coquerel's giant mouse lemur, and all individuals kept <b>at</b> <b>American</b> facilities were descended from six individuals imported by the DLC in 1982 {{from the region}} around Ambanja. As of 2009, the International Species Information System (ISIS) recorded only six remaining individuals registered in the United States and Europe, all reclassified as northern giant mouse lemurs and considered a non-breeding population; and in 2015, only a single female remained on record.|$|E
25|$|Ballard {{began working}} for Andreas Rechnitzer's Ocean Systems Group <b>at</b> North <b>American</b> Aviation in 1962 when his father, Chet, the chief {{engineer}} <b>at</b> North <b>American</b> Aviation's Minuteman missile program, helped him get a part-time job. <b>At</b> North <b>American,</b> he worked on North American's failed proposal to build the submersible Alvin for the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.|$|R

50|$|Besides this {{research}} and teaching, Bowen had other faculty appointments and consultancies. He was visiting professor {{in a variety}} of medical schools, for example at the University of Maryland from 1956 to 1963 and at the Medical College of Virginia of Richmond from 1964 to 1978. He was life fellow <b>at</b> the <b>American</b> Psychiatric Association and <b>at</b> the <b>American</b> Orthopsychiatric Association, and life member at the Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry. He was <b>at</b> the <b>American</b> Board of Psychiatry and Neurology in 1961 and first president <b>at</b> the <b>American</b> Family Therapy Association.|$|R
5|$|His {{basketball}} {{performance in}} high school was unimpressive. He came off the bench to average four points per game (ppg). His stepmother informed him that when he graduated high school he would be {{thrown out of the}} house. Chris had been able to leave home on a football scholarship and would later play in the National Football League, but Washington himself had nowhere to go. He trained for three hours a day {{toward the end of his}} senior season, and showed up uninvited at a playground game featuring top high school players from Washington and Pennsylvania, where he talked his way into the game. Tom Young, who had recently left his job as an assistant coach at Maryland University to become head coach <b>at</b> <b>American</b> University, saw him play there, and although Washington did not perform particularly well, Young was impressed by his hustle and how he ignored the poor treatment he received from the people who organized the game.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{when he was}} {{not working}} <b>at</b> <b>American</b> Greetings, Crumb drew many Fritz the Cat strips for his own amusement. Some of these strips would later be {{published}} in Help! and Cavalier magazines and in the underground comix. Fritz also appears briefly in Crumb's graphic novel Big Yum Yum Book: The Story of Oggie and the Beanstalk, drawn in 1964, but not published until 1975. Several characters from the anthropomorphic universe of Fritz the Cat appeared in another Crumb comic strip, The Silly Pigeons, drawn in 1965 and intended for Help! In 1970, Crumb redrew an early Fuzzy the Bunny story written by Charles Crumb in 1952; it was published in Zap Comix #5.|$|E
5|$|In April 1958, S. Gill (Ferranti) {{discussed}} {{parallel programming}} {{and the need}} for branching and waiting. Also in 1958, IBM researchers John Cocke and Daniel Slotnick discussed the use of parallelism in numerical calculations for the first time. Burroughs Corporation introduced the D825 in 1962, a four-processor computer that accessed up to 16 memory modules through a crossbar switch. In 1967, Amdahl and Slotnick published a debate about the feasibility of parallel processing <b>at</b> <b>American</b> Federation of Information Processing Societies Conference. It was during this debate that Amdahl's law was coined to define the limit of speed-up due to parallelism.|$|E

5|$|Investigators {{found that}} as the jet was {{beginning}} its takeoff rotation, engine number one separated from the left wing, flipping {{over the top of}} the wing and landing on the runway. As the engine separated from the aircraft, it severed hydraulic lines that locked the wing's leading edge slats in place and damaged a three-foot section of the left wing's leading edge. Aerodynamic forces acting on the wing resulted in an uncommanded retraction of the outboard slats. As the jet began to climb, the damaged left wing, with no engine, produced far less lift (stalled) than the right wing, with its slats still deployed and its engine running at full takeoff speed. The disrupted and unbalanced aerodynamics of the aircraft caused it to roll abruptly to the left until it was partially inverted, reaching a bank angle of 112 degrees, before crashing in an open field by a trailer park near the end of the runway. The engine separation was attributed to damage to the pylon structure holding the engine to the wing, caused by improper maintenance procedures used <b>at</b> <b>American</b> Airlines.|$|E
5|$|Lacker was {{instrumental}} in convincing Presley to record with Memphis producer Chips Moman and his handpicked musicians <b>at</b> <b>American</b> Sound Studio in early 1969. The American Sound sessions represented {{a significant departure from}} the control customarily exerted by Hill and Range. Moman still {{had to deal with the}} publisher's staff on site, whose song suggestions he regarded as unacceptable. He was on the verge of quitting, until Presley ordered the Hill and Range personnel out of the studio. Although RCA executive Joan Deary was later full of praise for the producer's song choices and the quality of the recordings, Moman, to his fury, received neither credit on the records nor royalties for his work.|$|E
5|$|Le Guin was {{strongly}} opposed to and {{troubled by the}} Vietnam War, a reaction which played a large part {{in the tone of}} the novel. The tone of the novel is often harsh and hard-hitting, playing off the anger in the United States <b>at</b> <b>American</b> military actions in Vietnam. The tension between violence and non-violence {{is a part of the}} dialectic theme in the novel, of a constant tension between opposites. Through most of the novel, the Terran military is in control of the colony, despite Raj Lyubov's good intentions. Davidson is the most prominent example of the oppressiveness of the military government. There are intentional parallels drawn between the Terran colonizers and the US intervention in Vietnam; the anti-interventionist tone of the novel was in sharp contrast to other science-fiction novels about war written around the same period. For example, the high use of drugs amongst US troops in Vietnam is represented by the use of hallucinogens amongst the Terran soldiers, which Le Guin portrays as the norm on the colony.|$|E

5|$|The American {{prisoners were}} quickly {{returned}} to the United States, most by plane. Those who were still sick or weakened remained <b>at</b> <b>American</b> hospitals to continue to recuperate. On February11, 1945, 280 POWs left Leyte aboard the transport USS General A.E. Anderson bound for San Francisco via Hollandia, New Guinea. In an effort to counter the improved American morale, Japanese propaganda radio announcers broadcast to American soldiers that submarines, ships, and planes were hunting the General Anderson. The threats {{proved to be a}} bluff, and the ship safely arrived in San Francisco Bay on March8, 1945.|$|E
5|$|The British Navy in New York had {{not been}} inactive. Vice-Admiral Sir George Collier engaged {{in a number of}} amphibious raids agaynst coastal {{communities}} from Chesapeake Bay to Connecticut, and probed <b>at</b> <b>American</b> defences in the Hudson River valley. Coming up the river in force, he supported the key outpost capture of Stony Point, but advanced no further. When Clinton weakened the garrison there to provide men for raiding expeditions, Washington organised a counterstrike. Brigadier General Anthony Wayne led a force that, solely using the bayonet, recaptured Stony Point. The Americans chose not to hold the post, but their morale was dealt a blow later in the year, when their failure to co-operate with the French led to an unsuccessful attempt to dislodge the British from Savannah. Control of Georgia was formally returned to its royal governor, James Wright, in July 1779, but the backcountry would not come under British control until after the 1780 Siege of Charleston. Patriot forces recovered Augusta by siege in 1781, but Savannah remained in British hands until 1782. The damage sustained at Savannah forced Marseillois, ZÃ©lÃ©, Sagittaire, Protecteur and Experiment to return to Toulon for repairs.|$|E
5|$|The Metamorfosis World Tour was a {{worldwide}} concert tour by Guatemalan singerâ€“songwriter Ricardo Arjona {{in support of}} his thirteenth studio album, Independiente. Beginning in January 2012, it was Arjona's first tour since leaving Warner Music to become an independent artist. The tour was announced in December 2011 with dates <b>at</b> <b>American,</b> Argentinian and Chilean venues, and received a positive critical response. The show was designed for a revolving stage, with Arjona performing while the scenery changed with the songs being performed. Four changes of scenery were developed: a two-floor apartment, a bar, a circus and a theatre. The number of songs played at each show varied from 19 to 23.|$|E
2500|$|Sigmund Freud was vehemently anti-American. Historian Peter Gay {{says that}} in [...] "slashing away <b>at</b> <b>Americans</b> wholesale; quite indiscriminately, with imaginative ferocity, Freud was {{ventilating}} some inner need".

5|$|The {{practice}} became Adams & Holden in 1907 when Holden {{became a}} partner and Adams, Holden & Pearson when Lionel Pearson became a partner in 1913. In 1913, Holden was awarded the RIBA's Godwin medal and Â£65 to study architecture abroad. He travelled to America in April 1913 and studied the organisation of household and social science departments <b>at</b> <b>American</b> universities in preparation for his design of the Wren-influenced Kings College for Women, Kensington. Other buildings by Holden before the First World War include modernist office buildings in Holborn and Oxford Street, an extension in red brick of Alfred Waterhouse's Shire Hall in Bedford, and Arts and Crafts Sutton Valence School, Kent.|$|E
5|$|Upon his {{discharge}} from the Army {{and return to the}} States in 1946, Benedetto studied at the American Theatre Wing on the GI Bill. He was taught the bel canto singing discipline, which would keep his voice in good shape for his entire career. He continued to perform wherever he could, including while waiting tables. Based upon a suggestion from a teacher <b>at</b> <b>American</b> Theatre Wing, he developed an unusual approach that involved imitating, as he sang, the style and phrasing of other musicians â€” such as that of Stan Getz's saxophone and Art Tatum's piano â€” helping him to improvise as he interpreted a song. He made a few recordings as Bari in 1949 for small Leslie Records, but they failed to sell.|$|E
5|$|Solis's {{confirmation}} hearings were held on January 9, 2009, before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Committee chair Ted Kennedy repeatedly praised her, while, despite examination by Republican members, Solis {{declined to discuss}} specific policy issues, including the Employee Free Choice Act. Several days later, Senate Republicans said they might try to put a procedural hold on her nomination because of her unwillingness to answer questions in detail in the hearings. By January 23, a secret hold {{was placed on the}} nomination by an anonymous Republican. A series of written questions and responses between Republican members and Solis followed, during which she was more forthcoming. Republican Mike Enzi pressed her on whether her unpaid high-level positions <b>at</b> <b>American</b> Rights at Work constituted prohibited lobbying activity; Solis denied violation of rules of conduct and stated she had not helped lobbying. Solis did acknowledge that she had failed to report those positions on her annual House financial disclosure forms at the time, which a White House spokesperson argued was an unintentional oversight. On February 2, Obama appointed veteran Labor Department official Edward C. Hugler as Acting Secretary. The prolonged process was considered by some Republican aides to be a preview of future battles on labor issues between the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress.|$|E
