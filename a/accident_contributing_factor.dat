40|$|This is a reportThe SafetyNet {{project is}} an Integrated Project (IP) which was {{developed}} {{as part of}} the European Commission’s 6 th Framework programme. SafetyNet has built the foundations of a European Road Safety Observatory (ERSO) which can be used by the European Commission for the purposes of policy review and development. The SafetyNet project is divided into seven main Work Packages each of which deal with specific aspects of road safety research (see www. erso. eu). The objective of the SafetyNet Work Package 5, Task 2 was to develop an in-depth European accident causation database to identify risk <b>factors</b> that <b>contribute</b> to road <b>accidents.</b> To assist in the analysis of the accident causation a method, known as SNACS, was further developed, tested and revised throughout the project. The accident investigations were performed by existing multidisciplinary teams within the partnership which have many years of experience. The accident causation database was developed in two parts; a set of general variables about the accident, vehicle, road environment and road users and a part which was dedicated to the accident causation analysis performed with the SafetyNet Accident Causation System (SNACS). The definitions for the general variables and values as well as the SNACS method were piloted and revised several times before data collection commenced to ensure high quality in the gathered data. In total, 1006 accident cases were investigated which include 1833 vehicles and pedestrians. In the aggregated analysis these vehicles were grouped according to their trajectory prior to the accident and the groups were; Vehicles leaving their lane (n = 354), Vehicles encountering something in their lane (n = 537), Vehicles encountering another vehicle on crossing paths (n = 528) and Accidents involving slower moving vulnerable road users (n = 92 pedestrians; 95 Pedal Cyclists, 177 opponents) The aim of the analyses conducted was not to explore and evaluate the effectiveness of new technologies, but rather to demonstrate the potential uses for the accident causation database and identify common accident scenarios. The SNACS charts in the groups were aggregated to allow the most commonly occurring <b>accident</b> <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> to be identified. In the SNACS charts the information is rich and detailed and it is by nature complex as it reflects the complex interactions between the road users, vehicles and environment that occur in an accident. The SNACS method assists in the process of identifying patterns that will allow the most common <b>accident</b> <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> to be focused on when designing countermeasures...|$|R

The current study was undertaken to determine whether errors and violations are more often associated with different local and organisational <b>factors</b> that <b>contribute</b> to rail <b>accidents.</b> The <b>Contributing</b> <b>Factors</b> Framework (CFF), a tool developed for the collection and codification of data regarding rail accidents and incidents, was applied to a sample of investigation reports. In addition, a more detailed categorisation of errors was undertaken. Ninety-six investigation reports into Australian accidents and incidents occurring between 1999 and 2008 were analysed. Each report was coded independently by two experienced coders. Task demand factors were significantly more often associated with skill-based errors, knowledge and training deficiencies significantly associated with mistakes, and violations significantly linked to social environmental factors...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Occupational {{injuries}} {{are the leading}} cause of morbidity and mortality among workers. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the frequency of occupational injuries and health status of workers. Material and methods The examined group consisted of 3. 750 workers with health disorders. The control group included 1. 800 healthy workers. Both groups were similar in terms of many <b>factors</b> that could <b>contribute</b> to the occurrence of occupational injuries. The injury rates were calculated in both groups. Results Workers with psychomotor and sensorimotor disorders, neuroses, obstructive sleep apnea, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hearing, vascular and sight impairments have been frequently injured compared to workers with other diseases. Discussion Due to the belief that accidents and occupational {{injuries are}} preventable, it is an imperative to study those factors which are likely to contribute to occurrence of <b>accidents.</b> The <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> could be the physical and mental state of workers.

The aim was to analyse specific driving task-related factors to investigate how these type of factors affect the driver undertaking their tasks within driving. A selection of driving task-related factors were chosen and analysed using two types of analysis; by a statistical method and by an in-depth methodology developed in TRACE. Typical characteristics of these accidents were identified, and {{for a number of}} factors, typical failure generating scenarios were also identified. From this, a list of possible countermeasures were defined with the aim of preventing such accidents occurring. These included driver education, in-vehicle technologies and design issues. Finally, benefits and limitations of the analysis undertaken are given, with recommendation for future work on driving task-related factors. driving task level, <b>accident</b> causation, <b>contributing</b> <b>factors,</b> attention, speed, sudden health problems, mobile phone use, sudden technical defects, dazzling sunshine, logistic regression, TRACE Work Package 5 methodolog...|$|R
5|$|One {{week later}} the FIA {{announced}} a review panel {{to investigate the}} cause of the accident, which was made up of former drivers and team principals, and published its findings four weeks later. The report found that there was no single cause of Bianchi's <b>accident.</b> Instead, the <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> were found to include track conditions, car speed and the presence of a recovery vehicle on the circuit. The report also made several suggestions to improve safety when recovering stricken vehicles — which were subsequently introduced for the 2015 season — before concluding that {{it would not have been}} possible to mitigate Bianchi's injuries through changes to the cockpit design. The report also revealed that the fail-safe for the car's brake-by-wire system had failed. Despite this, Marussia was not found to be responsible for the accident.|$|R
40|$|Rapport de rechercheWP 3 of the European Project TRACE is {{concerned}} with Types of Factors to analyse the causation of road traffic accidents from a factors' point of view. In task 3. 3 'Trip-related Factors' it was tried to characterise accidents that are caused by certain <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> found on a trip level. This was done by applying one statistical method to existing databases of the WP 3 Partners {{on the one hand}} and on the other hand by performing an in-depth case analysis using the WP 5 method. The analysed factors stem from the Human Component of the accident causation classification, namely "alcohol", "vigilance", and "experience", from the Vehicle Component, namely "vehicle condition/maintenance", and from the Environment component, namely "road layout" and "road condition". This selection resulted from the task 3. 1 conclusions and feasibility reasons. Due to inhomogeneous results for the databases from Austria, France, Germany, Great Britain, and Spain the detailed results will be pictured in an Internal TRACE Report by Sub-reports of the WP 3 Partners, in this task report the main results are discussed with respect to findings and data in other databases available to the TRACE partners as requested from WP 8. Both methods applied show that trip-related factors are possible to prevent not on a trip level only, but also from a background level and as well on a level closer to the accident (driving task level). However, only some suggestions are possible to give by these results. A more detailed view for preventing the different accidents that result from trip-related factors is necessary, as shown by the results of BASt with the statistic method, as well as by INRETS with the ultra in-depth WP 5 method. trip level, <b>accident</b> causation, <b>contributing</b> <b>factors,</b> alcohol, vigilance, experience, vehicle condition, road condition and layou...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the primary}} reasons of the {{escalating}} rates of injuries and fatalities {{in the construction industry}} is the ever so complex, dynamic and continually changing nature of construction work. Use of cranes has become imperative to overcome technical challenges, which has lead to escalation of danger on a construction site. Data from OSHA show that crane accidents have increased rapidly from 2000 to 2004. By analyzing the characteristics of all the crane accident inspections, we can better understand the significance of the many variables involved in a crane accident. For this research, data were collected from the U. S. Department of Labor website via the OSHA database. The data encompass crane accident inspections for all the states. The data were divided into categories with respect to accident types, construction operations, degree of <b>accident,</b> fault, <b>contributing</b> <b>factors,</b> crane types, victim?s occupation, organs affected and load. Descriptive analysis was performed to compliment the previous studies, the only difference being that both fatal and non-fatal accidents have been considered. Multinomial regression has been applied to derive probability models and correlation between different accident types and the factors involved for each crane accident type. A log likelihood test as well as chi-square test was performed to validate the models. The results show that electrocution, crane tip over and crushed during assembly/disassembly have more probability of occurrence than other accident types. Load is not a significant factor for the crane accidents, and manual fault is more probable a cause for crane accident than is technical fault. Construction operations identified in the research were found to be significant for all the crane accident types. Mobile crawler crane, mobile truck crane and tower crane were found to be more susceptible. These probability models are limited as far as the inculcation of unforeseen variables in construction accidents are concerned. In fact, these models utilize the past to portray the future, and therefore significant change in the variables involved is required to be added to attain correct and expedient results...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of effective accident prevention measures requires {{insight into how}} accidents occur {{and the extent to}} which <b>accident</b> causal <b>factors</b> <b>contribute</b> to <b>accidents.</b> Construction projects features (CPFs) such as the nature of project, method of construction, site restriction, project duration, procurement system, design complexity, level of construction, and subcontracting have been noted as being contributors to accident causation. However, how they <b>contribute</b> to <b>accident</b> causation and the extent of their contribution remain to be fully explored by research. An extensive review of health and safety (H&S) literature within the UK construction industry discusses the accident causal influence of CPFs to the end of providing preliminary insight into how {{and the extent to which}} CPFs <b>contribute</b> to <b>accident</b> causation. The study reveals that CPFs <b>contribute</b> to <b>accident</b> causation through the introduction of proximal accident causal factors and the extent of their contribution is influenced by the degree of prevalence of the proximal factors within the CPFs. The usefulness of this insight for preventing accidents right from the early stage of project procurement is subsequently presented. The application of the findings of the study will contribute towards achieving improved health and safety outcomes on construction projects...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOrganization {{safeguards}} {{can never}} be entirely effective because the decision makers cannot foresee all the possible <b>accident</b> scenarios. Then, <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> originating at many levels of the system, in combination with local triggers, open {{a window of opportunity}} in which the hazards are allowed to pass unchecked through successive weaknesses in the so called defences in depth. This is why a good organization has a continuous improvement process, and why a good continuous improvement process has frontline teams playing the key role of the last line of defence against organizational gaps, weakness or failures. The paper introduced a way of using Virtual Reality focusing on frontline teams for improving organizational safeguards. It presents a methodology build up during the Virthualis project, able to address the following questions: How to design an organization which provides frontline teams with some mental skills that would help them to recognize and, if possible, contribute to avoid situations with a high error potential? How to design an organization for managing of learning and changes based on such frontline teams contribution? This methodology addresses the way safety rules are written (integrating roles and responsibilities, procedures & risk assessment). It defines a structured approach for designing and using virtual environments [...] . making it possible to work, in a collaborative way, for the design and the implementation of good practices during nominal situations and in case of degraded, rare and/or dangerous situations. This methodology is still in a research and development phase. It has to be tested and improved...|$|R
40|$|Road {{safety is}} a major concern of every {{department}} of transportation. Allocating resources to improve safety requires the identification of hazardous sites (hotspots) and the assessment of safety countermeasures. For such tasks, reliable safety performance functions are noteworthy to predict collisions, prioritize improvements, and capture countermeasure effectiveness for overall road network management. In this thesis, a case study from New Brunswick was used. Bayesian statistics were mainly applied in analyses by introducing Poisson mixture models in a hierarchical fashion. Poisson and Poisson mixture models were compared. Different characterizations of variance functions were verified. In a novel approach, the inverse of variance in Poisson-Lognormal models was examined to vary across sites as a function of site characteristics. In addition, accidents were analyzed by severity. Hierarchical Poisson-Gamma models presented the best fit. Traffic flow was the most influential factor in variance functions. Models with random variance structure provided the best fit, followed by those varying as a function of site characteristics. The interaction between precipitation and density of horizontal curves was statistically significant only for injury-fatality <b>accidents</b> - these <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> weren’t significant when considered separately. Additionally, the effect of prior specifications in hierarchical Poisson-Gamma models was examined adopting a case study and a data simulation framework. Results showed that informative priors, especially for the inverse dispersion parameter, improve the accuracy of parameter estimates. Data with low sample mean and small sample size were dramatically affected by prior specification. However, hotspot identification and goodness-of-fit were not very sensitive to prior choice. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Accident modelling, in {{an attempt}} to {{understand}} how the event happened, has traditionally being based on understanding accidents as a linear sequence of events and has not significantly evolved since its early inception in the safety sciences. Today however, modern software programs, particularly those being used for Social Network Analysis (SNA), offer the possibility to understand accidents and incidents as a complex network of relationships of <b>contributing</b> <b>factors,</b> perhaps for the first time. The analysis of railway incidents using this previously unexplored method has enabled accident investigations to move into a new era in the understanding of accident phenomenology in complex socio-technical systems. Aim: This research is interested in exploring how accident/incident data can be visually modelled using previously unexplored methods and what further understandings about the relationships between the <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> in railway incidents can be gleaned by the use of more modern methods of data (network) analysis. Method: Major railway incident reports, for a five year period (2006 – 2010), were analysed and data was collected on the <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> using the <b>Contributing</b> <b>Factors</b> Framework (CFF), a tool developed specifically for the rail industry in Australia. The <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> for various types of incidents were then modelled using Social Network Analysis methods. Results: The use of Social Network Analysis has enabled the relationship between of each of the <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> to be identified. The resulting models were analysed and the relationship between the main <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> for each type of railway incident was explored. By using this new methodology for accident analysis it is possible to obtain a clear visual picture of the inter-connectiveness of <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> and to further understand the relationship of constituent parts of complex systems. Discussion: The outcome of this research has been {{the development of a new}} method of accident modelling that moves beyond traditional linear models and better reflects modern day safety science thinking about complex socio-technical systems. It is hoped that this type of method can provide new and previously unknown knowledge about the interconnectedness of the <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> for different types of rail incidents and accidents in the quest to enhance accident prevention and learning...|$|R
