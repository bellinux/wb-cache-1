5|$|Bart and Lisa {{begin to}} hear strange noises {{coming from the}} attic. Homer claims not {{to know what they}} <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> even though he is seen heading into the attic with a bucket of fish heads. Bart and Lisa investigate, and {{discover}} there really is a monster. Homer and Marge go into the attic, and discover that the creature has escaped, prompting Marge to call Dr. Hibbert. He explains that Bart has a twin brother named Hugo. The two were separated at birth, but it was discovered that Hugo was too evil to live in society, so the Simpsons kept him chained in the attic, where Homer fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week. The rest of the family leaves to find Hugo, leaving Bart behind, but he discovers that Hugo never left the house. Hugo takes Bart to the attic and ties him up, so that he can reattach himself, but Dr. Hibbert bursts in and knocks out Hugo. He then realizes that Hugo's scar is on the wrong side, and Bart is the evil twin. In an attempt to correct their wrong, Dr. Hibbert and the Simpson family sit down to a turkey dinner with Hugo, leaving Bart locked in the attic.|$|E

25|$|The {{constellation}} Virgo is {{a specific}} constellation of stars in the sky, hence the process of forming Virgo cannot be an operational definition, since it is historical and not repeatable. Nevertheless, the process whereby we locate Virgo in the sky is repeatable, so in this way, Virgo is operationally defined. In fact, Virgo can have any number of definitions (although we can never prove that we <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the same Virgo), and any number may be operational.|$|E

25|$|Huckabee has voiced {{his support}} for self-defense and the Castle Doctrine, and has {{generally}} taken an anti-gun control stance. He believes that the concealed carrying of weapons should be allowed. He has said that whenever he hears people start talking about hunting when referring to the Second Amendment, he realizes {{they do not know}} what they <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> because the Second Amendment was to allow an armed citizenry the opportunity to protect themselves in case a tyrannical government ever came into power.|$|E
25|$|British writer Arthur C. Benson felt shyness is {{not mere}} self-consciousness, but a {{primitive}} suspicion of strangers, the primeval belief that their motives are predatory, with shyness a sinister quality which {{needs to be}} uprooted. He believed the remedy is for the shy to frequent society for courage from familiarity. Also, he claimed that too many shy adults take refuge in a critical attitude, engaging in brutal onslaughts on inoffensive persons. He felt that a better way is for the shy to be nice, to wonder what others need and like, interest in what others do or <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> friendly questions, and sympathy.|$|E

While she is gone, King Arthur, who just escaped from the jail and is being tracked down by Mary Margaret, Merida and the dwarves, stumbles upon Hades, but he kills Arthur as he sees him as a threat. Zelena finds Regina and Robin Hood and tries to {{convince}} them that Hades has changed his ways. Emma, David and Henry are reunited with Snow and Merida and explain the details of Hades' deception but Emma's vengeance against Hades is making her too emotional. Zelena and Hades <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the others not believing that he changed.

In a June 2010 interview with The Columbians Alan Sculley, Bruce explained, [...] " [...] the stuff that people <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> on the streets...to get attention, you have to speak their language.

A challenge to Mosley's election by Jeffrey Rose, chairman of the British Royal Automobile Club, was withdrawn {{when it became clear that}} the majority of voters were already committed to Mosley.

500|$|Lyrically, {{the group}} {{addresses}} social issues including corruption, environmentalism, personal liberty, and Latin American identity. Canción de Alerta contains the song [...] "Por qué cantamos," [...] {{an adaptation of}} Uruguayan writer Mario Benedetti's poem of the same name. Author Eunice Rojas cites this {{as an example of}} the group using [...] "the power of music to advance social causes." [...] The song [...] "Suelta Los Amarres" [...] from Ideas Nuevas discourages listeners from using violence to advance a political cause. However, the lyrics on La Dulzura place more emphasis on interpersonal relationships and love. Silva notes that the group refrains from writing [...] "romantic" [...] lyrics, noting that [...] "romanticism has a connotation of suffering for love.

[...] While he enjoyed the episode overall, Stack wrote that Spears' songs felt forced into the storyline, and that the episode was neither as iconic nor as exhilarating as Glee Madonna tribute. The Parents Television Council slammed the episode, accusing the presentation of Spears as a [...] "symbol of empowerment and self-esteem" [...] problematic, observing that the young audience [...] "basically witnessed an endorsement of narcotics abuse, public masturbation, and school-sanctioned burlesque." ...|$|E
