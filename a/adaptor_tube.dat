40|$|Innate {{immunity}} {{mediated by}} Toll signalling {{has been extensively}} studied, but how Toll signalling is precisely controlled in balancing innate immune responses remains poorly understood. It was reported that the plasma membrane localization of Drosophila MyD 88 {{is necessary for the}} recruitment of cytosolic <b>adaptor</b> <b>Tube</b> to the cell surface, thus contributing to Toll signalling transduction. Here we demonstrate that Drosophila Pellino functions as a negative regulator in Toll-mediated signalling. We show that Pellino accumulates at the plasma membrane upon the activation of Toll signalling in a MyD 88 -dependent manner. Moreover, we find that Pellino is associated with MyD 88 via its CTE domain, which is necessary and sufficient to promote Pellino accumulation at the plasma membrane where it targets MyD 88 for ubiquitination and degradation. Collectively, our study uncovers a mechanism by which a feedback regulatory loop involving MyD 88 and Pellino controls Toll-mediated signalling, thereby maintaining homeostasis of host innate immunity...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe cell {{biological}} {{principles that}} govern innate immune responses in Drosophila are unknown. Here, {{we report that}} Toll signaling in flies was dictated by the subcellular localization of the adaptor protein dMyD 88. dMyD 88 was located at the plasma membrane by a process dependent on a C-terminal phosphoinositide-binding domain. In vivo analysis revealed that lipid binding by dMyD 88 was necessary for its antimicrobial and developmental functions {{as well as for}} the recruitment of the downstream cytosolic <b>adaptor</b> <b>Tube</b> to the cell surface. These data are reminiscent of the interactions between the mammalian Toll adaptors MyD 88 and TIRAP with one major exception. In the mammalian system, MyD 88 is the cytosolic adaptor that depends on the phosphoinositide-binding protein TIRAP for its recruitment to the cell surface. We therefore propose that dMyD 88 is the functional homolog of TIRAP and that both proteins function as sorting adaptors to recruit downstream signaling adaptors to activated receptors...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} of the serine/threonine kinase Pelle and <b>adaptor</b> protein <b>Tube</b> through their N-terminal death domains leads to the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor Dorsal and activation of zygotic patterning genes during Drosophila embryogenesis. Crystal structure of the Pelle and Tube death domain heterodimer reveals that the two death domains adopt a six-helix bundle fold and are arranged in an open-ended linear array with plastic interfaces mediating their interactions. The Tube death domain has an insertion between helices 2 and 3, and a C-terminal tail making significant and indispensable contacts in the heterodimer. In vivo assays of Pelle and Tube mutants confirmed that {{the integrity of the}} major heterodimer interface is critical to the activity of these molecules...|$|R
5000|$|High {{frequency}} {{jet ventilation}} (HFJV) {{is provided by}} the Bunnell Life Pulse High-Frequency Ventilator. HFJV employs an endotracheal <b>tube</b> <b>adaptor</b> in place for the normal 15 mm ET <b>tube</b> <b>adaptor.</b> A high pressure [...] "jet" [...] of gas flows out of the adaptor and into the airway. This jet of gas occurs for a very brief duration, about 0.02 seconds, and at high frequency: 4-11 hertz. Tidal volumes ≤ 1 ml/Kg are used during HFJV. This combination of small tidal volumes delivered for very short periods of time creates the lowest possible distal airway and alveolar pressures produced by a mechanical ventilator. Exhalation is passive. Jet ventilators utilize various I:E ratios—between 1:1.1 and 1:12—to help achieve optimal exhalation. Conventional mechanical breaths are sometimes used to aid in reinflating the lung. Optimal PEEP is used to maintain alveolar inflation and promote ventilation-to-perfusion matching. Jet ventilation has been shown to reduce ventilator induced lung injury by as much as 20%. Usage of high frequency jet ventilation is recommended in neonates and adults with severe lung injury.|$|R
40|$|Recently {{introduced}} plastic swivel connectors (both autoclavable and disposable) {{were examined}} under laboratory conditions for gas leakage. The leak from the autoclavable connectors before autoclaving nearly always exceeded 5 %. Although this leak was diminished after autoclaving, the swivelling property was greatly decreased. The position of maximal leakage {{was found to}} vary with {{the position of the}} connector on the tracheal or tracheostomy <b>tube</b> <b>adaptor.</b> The magnitude of the leaks obtained varied, only the disposable connectors complying with our own criteria. Comparison of the plastic connectors was made with one type of metal swivel connector which was also found to be acceptable for clinical use. Lightweight plastic connectors capable of rotating through 360 ° are available for connecting tracheal or tracheostomy <b>tube</b> <b>adaptors</b> to a catheter mount. Their swivelling property allows repositioning of ventilator tubing without disconnecting the patient and reduces torsion forces and drag on the tracheal or tracheostomy tube. This could diminish the occurrence of uneven pressure areas, ulceration of surrounding tissues and possible displacement of the tube. Because such connectors are so mobile there is a danger of gas leakage. The present study was de-signed to investigate this possibility. Two types of plastic swivel connectors were tested; one was suit-able for sterilization in an autoclave and the other was disposable. The results were compared with those from a metal connector possessing similar properties. DESIGN OF CONNECTORS Autoclavable plastic connector. The construction of this swivel connector (Portex Ltd, Hythe, Kent) is shown in figure 1. It is a right-angled tube made from acetyl copolymer; one limb connects to a catheter mount, the other houses an inner female 15 mm internal diameter connection which can be push fitted on to a male 15 mm tracheal <b>tube</b> <b>adaptor.</b> There is a suction port at the elbow which is normally closed with a polypropylene stop...|$|R
40|$|Signaling {{from the}} transmembrane {{receptor}} Toll to Rel-related transcription factors regulates dorsoventral patterning of the Drosophila embryo, {{as well as}} larval and adult immunity. To identify additional pathway components, we have used double-stranded RNA interference to investigate Drosophila counterparts of genes that regulate the mammalian Rel family member NF-κB. Experiments in cultured cells reveal that the fly orthologue of the adaptor protein MyD 88 is essential for signal transduction from Toll to a second <b>adaptor</b> protein, <b>Tube.</b> By using coimmunoprecipitation studies, we find a heterotrimeric association of the death domains of MyD 88, Tube, and the protein kinase Pelle. Site-directed mutational analyses of interaction sites defined by crystallographic studies demonstrate that Tube recruits MyD 88 and Pelle into the heterotrimer by two distinct binding surfaces on the Tube death domain. Furthermore, functional assays confirm that the formation of this heterotrimer is critical for signal transduction by the Toll pathway...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{clinically}} evaluate a coil tube that we recently designed for bowel decompression in patients with a small bowel obstruction. MethodsThe coil tube was composed of a stainless steel coil, a polyolefin tube, and a rubber <b>adaptor.</b> The <b>tube</b> was inserted under fluoroscopic guidance in 14 consecutive patients with small bowel obstructions. Technical success was defined as insertion of the distal end of the tube into at least the proximal jejunum, and clinical success was defined as intestinal decompression and relief of obstructive symptoms. ResultsThe technical success rate was 100 %. Clinical success was achieved in 12 patients (86 %). The clinical failures were a patient with peritoneal carcinomatosis and an ileocolic fistula, and a patient with bezoars following intestinal hemorrhage. No coil-related complications occurred. ConclusionOur newly designed coil tube was safe and effective in patients with bowel decompression associated with a small bowel obstruction. In addition, our tube has several advantages over other currently used tube types...|$|R
40|$|The Drosophila Toll {{receptor}} {{is activated}} by the endogenous protein ligand Spätzle {{in response to}} microbial stimuli in immunity and spatial cues during embryonic development. Downstream signaling is mediated by the <b>adaptor</b> proteins <b>Tube,</b> the kinase Pelle, and the Drosophila homologue of myeloid differentiation primary response protein (dMyD 88). Here we have characterized heterodimeric (dMyD 88 -Tube) and heterotrimeric (dMyD 88 -Tube-Pelle) death domain complexes. We show that both the heterodimeric and heterotrimeric complexes form kidney-shaped structures and that Tube is bivalent and has separate high affinity binding sites for dMyD 88 and Pelle. Additionally we found no interaction between the isolated death domains of Pelle and dMyD 88. These {{results indicate that the}} mode of assembly of the heterotrimeric dMyD 88 -Tube-Pelle complex downstream of the activated Toll receptor is unique. The measured dissociation constants for the interaction between the death domains of dMyD 88 and Tube and of Pelle and a preformed dMyD 88 -Tube complex are used to propose a model of the early postreceptor events in Drosophila Toll receptor signaling...|$|R
