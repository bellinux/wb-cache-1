Participants were asked a series of mathematics questions.

50|$|The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Sixth Edition, {{defines a}} person with autism {{spectrum}} disorder as having persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction. This includes having deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, and deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships. Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder, meaning that it is characterized by developmental delays in basic functioning such as socialization and communication. Pervasive developmental disorders are also called autism spectrum disorders. These disorders include autistic disorder (autism), Asperger syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, Rett syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified.

Before the release of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, autistic disorder was the most common autism spectrum disorder.

5000|$|The ADI-R {{was written}} by Michael Rutter, MD FRS, Ann LeCouteur, MBBS and Catherine Lord, PhD. and {{published}} by Western Psychological Services in 2003. The original version of the Autism Diagnostic Interview, written in 1989, was used mainly for research purposes. The ADI was developed in response to four major developments {{in the field of}} diagnosing autism which led to a need for updated diagnostic tools. These developments included improvements in the diagnostic criteria, the need to differentiate between autism and other developmental disorders that appear similar early in life, and the desire, in the area of psychology, for standardized diagnostic instruments. [...] The original ADI could be used on individuals with a chronological age of at least five years and a mental age of at least two years, but <b>autism</b> <b>spectrum</b> <b>disorder</b> <b>is</b> usually diagnosed much earlier than this age. This finding led Rutter, LeCouteur, and Lord to revise the ADI in 1994 so that it could be used to determine a diagnosis in individuals with a mental age of at least 18 months.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{postulated}} that <b>autism</b> <b>spectrum</b> <b>disorder</b> <b>is</b> underpinned by an ‘atypical connectivity’ involving higher-order association brain regions. To test this hypothesis {{in a large}} cohort of adults with autism spectrum disorder we compared the white matter networks of 61 adult males with autism spectrum disorder and 61 neurotypical controls, using two complementary approaches to diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging. First, we applied tract-based spatial statistics, a ‘whole brain’ non-hypothesis driven method, to identify differences in white matter networks in adults with autism spectrum disorder. Following this we used a tractspecific analysis, based on tractography, {{to carry out a}} more detailed analysis of individual tracts identified by tract-based spatial statistics. Finally, within the autism spectrum disorder group, we studied the relationship between diffusion measures and autistic symptom severity. Tract-based spatial statistics revealed that autism spectrum disorder was associated with significantly reduced fractional anisotropy in regions that included frontal lobe pathways. Tractography analysis of these specific pathways showed increased mean and perpendicular diffusivity, and reduced number of streamlines in the anterior and long segments of the arcuate fasciculus, cingulum and uncinate—predominantly in the left hemisphere. Abnormalities were also evident in the anterior portions of the corpus callosum connecting left and right frontal lobes. The degree of microstructural alteration of the arcuate and uncinate fasciculi was associated with severity of symptoms in language and social reciprocity in childhood. Our results indicated that <b>autism</b> <b>spectrum</b> <b>disorder</b> <b>is</b> a developmental condition associated with abnormal connectivity of the frontal lobes. Furthermore our findings showed that male adults with autism spectrum disorder have regional differences in brain anatomy, which correlate with specific aspects of autistic symptoms. Overall these results suggest that <b>autism</b> <b>spectrum</b> <b>disorder</b> <b>is</b> a condition linked to aberrant developmental trajectories of the frontal networks that persist in adult life...|$|E

Typically diagnosed before age 3, <b>autism</b> <b>spectrum</b> <b>disorder</b> <b>is</b> behaviorally defined but patients {{are thought to}} have protracted alterations in brain maturation. With longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we mapped an anomalous developmental trajectory of the brains of autistic compared with those of typically developing children and adolescents. Using tensor-based morphometry, we created 3 D maps visualizing regional tissue growth rates based on longitudinal brain MRI scans of 13 autistic and seven typically developing boys (mean age/interscan interval: autism 12. 0 2. 3 years/ 2. 9 0. 9 years; control 12. 3 2. 4 / 2. 8 0. 8). The typically developing boys demonstrated strong whole brain white matter growth during this period, but the autistic boys showed abnormally slowed white matter development (P 0. 03, corrected), especially in the parietal (P 0. 008), temporal (P 0. 03), and occipital lobes (P 0. 02). We also visualized abnormal overgrowth in autism in gray matter structures such as the putamen and anterior cingulate cortex. Our findings reveal aberrant growth rates in brain regions implicated in social impairment, communication deficits and repetitive behaviors in autism, suggesting that growth rate abnormalities persist into adolescence.
