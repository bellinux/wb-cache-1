2500|$|UV ozone {{generators}} use ambient air for ozone production, no air prep systems are used (air dryer or oxygen concentrator), therefore these generators {{tend to be}} less expensive. [...] However UV {{ozone generators}} usually produce ozone with a concentration of about 0.5% or lower which limits the potential ozone production rate. Another disadvantage of this method is that it requires the ambient air (oxygen) to be exposed to the UV source for a longer amount of time, and any gas that is not exposed to the UV source will not be treated. This makes UV generators impractical for use in situations that deal with rapidly moving air or water streams (in-duct air sterilization, for example). Production of ozone is one of the potential dangers of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation. VUV ozone generators are used in swimming pool and spa applications ranging to millions of gallons of water. VUV ozone generators, unlike corona discharge generators, do not produce harmful nitrogen by-products and also unlike corona discharge systems, VUV ozone generators work extremely well in humid air environments. There is also not normally a need for expensive off-gas mechanisms, and no need for <b>air</b> <b>driers</b> or oxygen concentrators which require extra costs and maintenance.|$|E

40|$|Single-phase {{induction}} {{machines are}} found in various appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines, <b>driers,</b> <b>air</b> conditioners, and fans. Large concentrations of single-phase induction motor loads such as air conditioners and other motor-compressor loads can adversely impact the dynamic performance of a power system. An understanding {{of the dynamics of}} this type of induction machine is needed to improve {{the current state of the}} art in running power system dynamic studies. In this thesis, a novel approach of modeling an exact fourth-order model of a single-phase induction machine is developed that gives credence to the well-known double revolving-field theory. Using a standard averaging technique, an augmented seventh-order dynamic model is derived using forward- and backward-rotating components. The double-frequency terms causing torque and speed pulsations in the original model can be recovered as a byproduct of the theory. It is proved that two three-phase induction machines with their stator windings connected in series but with opposite phase sequence have the same dynamical behavior as the averaged single-phase induction machine model. The dynamic and steady-state performances of the single-phase machine are investigated using the new augmented model and compared with the exact model...|$|R
40|$|Many coated {{products}} {{are made by}} spreading a solution, prepared by dissolving a polymer in a solvent, on a substrate and then removing the solvent from the solution by blowing jets of hot air across it, from the bottom and the top, in multi-zone <b>driers.</b> <b>Air</b> flow, its temperature and its degree of saturation with the solvent constitute important operating conditions in every zone of an industrial drier. Air flow and its temperature can be manipulated easily in each zone to meet the goal of removing the solvent to specified levels without inducing any defects. Drying of polymeric coatings in multi-zone driers, with each zone operated at different air flow and temperature, involves simultaneous mass and heat transport and shrinkage because of solvent evaporation. Mathematical modeling (Alsoy and Duda, 1998; Price and Cairncross, 2000) has been used extensively to study drying. Fick’s law with a diffusion coefficient predicted by free volume theory (Vrentas and Duda, 1977 a, b) describes mass transport in the coating. A lumped model describes heat transport in the coating ignoring change in temperature across coating thickness and, shrinkage is obtained by solvent mass balance. We model poly (vinyl acetate) / toluene system in a two-zone drier. Improper choice of operating conditions can create defects such as blisters, mottle, warping, crazing, and cracking. In this work, only blister formation during drying is considered. Blisters are created whenever the solvent partial pressure in the coating exceeds ambient pressure in the drier (Price and Cairncross, 2000). Intense operatin...|$|R

40|$|The {{attached}} document {{is the final}} report of the Defra Project OF 0176. Demand for organic grain continues to grow and currently in the UK much has to be imported to satisfy the market. Expansion of UK production, together with continued imports, will see {{an increase in the}} need for effective grain storage using organic methods to preserve the quality of this valuable commodity. The objectives of this project were to conduct a desk study review to: 1) Highlight the main grain storage problems experienced by organic growers in the UK. 2) Bring together in a more convenient form technical information already available that will enable growers to tackle these problems more successfully. 3) Identify areas of current storage technology requiring a minimum of modification to ensure a smooth transfer from the conventional to the organic sector. 4) Identify areas where appropriate organic alternatives to conventional storage procedures do not exist that will require further research and development to find replacements. 	The following have been identified as areas requiring further research and development that are likely to provide important opportunities for improving the storage of organic grain: •	Store structure cleaning, including the effectiveness of vacuum cleaning and steam treatments, and the feasibility of using diatomaceous earths to control invertebrate pests. •	Energy efficient drying and cooling systems, and consider the use of renewable energy sources including solar and wind power or the processing of waste products and energy crops. •	More effective invertebrate pest monitoring through improvements in sampling strategies, together with enhanced trap design and the incorporation of lures. •	Disinfestation using grain cleaners and hot <b>air</b> <b>driers.</b> •	Biological control for store structure treatments. This will require work to assess the effectiveness of naturally occurring biological control agents to treat residual infestations hidden in empty grain store structures. Strategies will need to be developed to encourage the development and conservation of beneficial invertebrates in stores, including the possible use of natural semiochemicals to manipulate their behaviour. •	Biological control for surface infestations of grain. As well as looking at the practicality of using top-dressing or bait trap application techniques to control grain surface infestations in cooled bins, {{there is a need to}} develop effective methods for the removal of beneficial invertebrates from the grain immediately before it is marketed. A more detailed Executive Summary can be found at the top of the main report. ...|$|E
