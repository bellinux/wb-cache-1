500|$|The drug {{addiction}} of Towelie, {{a living and}} talking towel, is growing so overwhelming that the South Park boys make attempts to help him. Towelie's history is shown, using head interviews and on-screen captions (in a parody of Intervention), starting with years of {{drug addiction}} to cannabis, crystal meth, heroin and crack. He previously had a girlfriend named Rebecca and conceived a child with her (<b>a</b> <b>washcloth),</b> but he {{was kicked out of}} their home due to his persistently getting high. Having run out of money for hard drugs, Towelie starts getting high off of cans of computer duster. His life continued in a downward spiral, leaving him in heavy debt and offering oral sex to strangers for money in the alleys. The boys help him get a job at Lake Tardicaca, a summer camp for kids with physical and mental disabilities, as a towel to dry off the campers. However, Towelie persists in drug use and fellating strangers in the supply closet, and is fired by the camp. The boys confront Towelie and make emotional speeches to him as a plea to help him from killing himself (except for Cartman, who uses this opportunity to read what appears to be several tens of thousands of pages of anti-Semitic remarks on television, which the psychiatrist allows to continue in respect of the [...] "no interruptions" [...] rule). Towelie refuses their pleas until Butters reveals he has brought Towelie's child, [...] "Washcloth", which finally prompts him to accept the offer to go to a rehabilitation clinic in Southern California. Later, Towelie reveals he has completed rehab and is now living with his girlfriend and son.|$|E

She also stated {{that the way to}} ensure the future wealth of a baby is to put part of the child's umbilical cord in a bag together with a few coins. Lucky coins are lucky charms which are carried around attract wealth and good luck, whilst many, often silver coins, attached to bracelets multiply the effect as well as create a noise which scares away evil spirits. Bathing with a penny wrapped in <b>a</b> <b>washcloth</b> brings good fortune at Beltane or the Winter Solstice in Celtic Mythology.

50|$|Most {{cases of}} otitis media are self-limiting, resolving spontaneously without {{treatment}} within 3-5 days. Age-appropriate analgesics or <b>a</b> warm <b>washcloth</b> {{placed over the}} affected ear can help relieve pain until the infection has passed.|$|R
50|$|Other {{treatments}} include putting <b>a</b> warm <b>washcloth</b> {{over the}} ingrown hair, shaving {{in a different}} direction, exfoliating with facial scrubs, brushes, sponges, towels, salves, or creams containing acids, and ibuprofen or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).|$|R
50|$|Upon awakening, {{application}} of <b>a</b> warm <b>washcloth</b> to the eyelids {{for one to}} two minutes may be beneficial in decreasing the occurrence of styes by liquefying {{the contents of the}} oil glands of the eyelid and thereby preventing blockage.|$|R
50|$|Often {{people use}} soaps and {{detergents}} {{to assist in}} the emulsification of oils and dirt particles so they can be washed away. The soap can be applied directly, or with the aid of <b>a</b> <b>washcloth.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{squeegee}} man or squeegee woman, squeegee kid (Canada), squeegee punk (Montreal), squeegee merchant (London) or squeegee bandit is {{a person}} who, using <b>a</b> <b>washcloth</b> and squeegee, wipes windshields of cars stopped in traffic and then solicits money from drivers.|$|E
50|$|A warm {{compress}} is {{a method}} of applying heat to the body. It can either be dry and warm or wet and warm. A wet and warm compress is often created by taking <b>a</b> <b>washcloth</b> and wetting it with warm water.|$|E
50|$|It is {{normally}} possible {{to establish the}} cause of ear pain based on the history. It is important to exclude cancer where appropriate, particularly with unilateral otalgia in an adult who uses tobacco or alcohol.Often migraines are caused by middle ear infections which can easily be treated with antibiotics. Often using <b>a</b> hot <b>washcloth</b> can temporarily relieve ear pain.|$|R

50|$|It can be {{used for}} {{anything}} a towel could be used for - as <b>a</b> <b>washcloth,</b> dishcloth, but often as a headband, souvenir, decoration, or for wrapping items such as bottles. Towels made from terry cloth have largely replaced it in household use. However tenugui are still popular as souvenirs, decorations, and as a head covering in kendo, where it functions as a sweatband, as extra padding beneath the headgear (men).|$|E
50|$|Primary {{treatment}} involves washing exposed skin thoroughly with soap, water, and friction as soon {{as possible}} after exposure is discovered. Soap or detergent is necessary because urushiol is an oil; friction, with <b>a</b> <b>washcloth</b> or something similar, is necessary because urushiol adheres strongly to the skin. Commercial removal preparations, which are available in areas where poison ivy grows, usually contain surfactants, such as the nonionic detergent Triton X-100, to solubilize urushiol; some products also contain abrasives.|$|E
50|$|Gerba is {{best known}} for work in {{environmental}} germ theory in the household. His surveys produced scientific backing for two useful bits of everyday advice; in kitchens, <b>a</b> reused <b>washcloth</b> {{is likely to be the}} most infectious and germ-carrying object in a house. In the bathroom, a flushed toilet with the seat up will spray germs into the air and disperse them throughout a room through a toilet plume.|$|R

5000|$|Soften lid margin {{debris and}} oils: Place {{a very warm}} wet {{compress}} such as <b>a</b> warm wet <b>washcloth</b> over the closed eyelids for five minutes. Re-wet and reapply it as it cools. This warms, softens, and loosens crusty and oily eyelid gland deposits.|$|R
50|$|For a bed bath, a bath blanket is put {{over the}} patient and only the area washed is exposed at a time for privacy and warmth. To make a mitt out of <b>a</b> <b>washcloth,</b> the fingers and palm of the {{dominant}} hand are placed over the washcloth and the washcloth is folded over the fingers and palm. The remaining part of the washcloth not covering the fingers and palms will be folded over and tucked in and the thumb {{will be out of}} the mitt.|$|E

He is {{in bed with}} <b>a</b> <b>washcloth</b> on his head as she enters - still hugely pregnant - pushing a bassinet. Michael is having sympathetic labor pains and is very needy and upset. He already feels displaced by the baby to come. Sitting on his lap, Agnes goes into labor. As Michael goes for the doctor, they promise to each other that they will never let anything happen to their relationship.|$|E
50|$|Pila skin {{requires}} the same care as human skin: frequent bathing - or rubbing down with <b>a</b> <b>washcloth</b> - {{and application of}} hypoallergenic body cream to avoid dryness. Sun exposure should be avoided, and sunscreen applied when outdoors in the daylight, with especially high SPF for lighter coloured dogs. Pilas don’t harbour fleas but are affected by mosquitoes, and they are attacked by ticks and should be examined daily to remove any of these parasites. They need to wear warm clothes in cold weather, and long sleeved T-shirts can replace sunscreen in warm weather.|$|E
5000|$|The Tickle Pink Inn, a {{motel in}} Carmel Highlands, California, folds {{the ends of}} its toilet paper into fan-like designs, {{mirroring}} the folds of its bathroom <b>washcloths.</b> <b>A</b> review in the San Francisco Chronicle noted the practice as [...] "a fancy touch".|$|R
50|$|A {{teething}} ring is generally a soft plastic device {{that can be}} chewed on and allows the baby to break {{down some of the}} gum tissue which promotes the growth of the teeth out of the gum. Some {{teething ring}}s can easily be broken or damaged, so other types of teething devices can be made from household items. Placing <b>a</b> wet <b>washcloth</b> in the freezer {{for a few minutes and}} then applying it gently to the gums can be effective, but care must be taken not to expose a baby's gums to coldness for too long.|$|R
50|$|Bathtubs are {{increasingly}} common in modern Japanese homes, {{but there are}} still many small and old apartments in cities that do not have bathtubs, so public bathhouses called sentō are common. A regular bathhouse will have tap water heated in a boiler. In all but the most rural areas baths are segregated by gender, and customers bathe nude, many using <b>a</b> small <b>washcloth</b> to cover the genitals. Hotels, pachinko parlors and other venues may have on-site sentō for customer use.Patrons of traditional Japanese inns or ryokan will be offered the use of a furo for bathing, either a communal one with bathing times being scheduled in advance, or a private one.|$|R
5000|$|Surfactant {{preparations}} {{for this purpose}} are themselves called [...] "bath foam", [...] "foaming bath", or [...] "bubble bath", and frequently contain ingredients for additional purposes common to bath enhancers. Used at much higher concentration (for instance on <b>a</b> <b>washcloth),</b> such preparations (especially in liquid format) may {{also be used to}} wash skin or hair, so they are sometimes marketed for combined purposes; in a few cases, mild household detergents for hand washing of articles have also been labeled for such purposes, or for preventing soap scum on the bathtub (with or without foaming).|$|E
50|$|One of UMCOR’s {{tools in}} the fight against disease is the Health Kit. Health Kits consist of a hand towel, <b>a</b> <b>washcloth,</b> a comb, a nail file or {{fingernail}} clippers, a bar of soap, a toothbrush, a tube of toothpaste, and six adhesive bandages. These health kits are sent to people who cannot acquire these supplies due to poverty, natural disaster, or other reasons. UMCOR encourages local churches and other groups to compile Health Kits to donate to the agency’s mission. UMCOR believes that by individuals assembling these Health Kits that the donator will better understand the need for providing this type of aid.|$|E

50|$|In December 1994, Lowell and Roberta Amos {{attended}} a company executive {{party at the}} Atheneum Hotel in Detroit. The Amoses went to their suite at 4:30 am. Four hours later, Lowell called Bert Crabtree, another executive from the party, {{and seemed to be}} in a panic. Crabtree and another hotel guest named Daniel Porcasi went to the room, and Lowell told them that Roberta had died in an accident. Lowell said he needed to clean up before calling police, and he asked Porcasi to take his sport coat for him. Porcasi, while driving home that morning, looked inside the breast pocket of the coat, and found a small black leather case with a syringe without a needle, and <b>a</b> foul-smelling <b>washcloth</b> inside. Amos later reclaimed the coat, and its contents disappeared.|$|R
2500|$|Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean, a Frenchman {{released}} from Toulon prison after 19 years of imprisonment for stealing bread and failed attempts at escaping from the prison. Around June 2011, Jackman met with producer Cameron Mackintosh to audition in New York. To {{prepare for the}} role, Jackman lost [...] and later regained [...] to mirror his character's success. He avoided drinking coffee, warmed up at least 15 minutes every day, kept Ricola lozenges, drank as much as seven litres of water per day, sat in steam three times a day, took cold baths and used <b>a</b> wet <b>washcloth</b> over his face while flying, citing the musical's original co-director Trevor Nunn for his training. He worked extensively with vocal coach Joan Lader, and managed to extend his vocal range, which he originally categorised a high baritone, up to tenor.|$|R
50|$|Urushiol binds to {{the skin}} on contact, where it causes severe itching that {{develops}} into reddish inflammation or non-coloured bumps, and then blistering. These lesions may be treated with Calamine lotion, Burow's solution compresses, dedicated commercial poison ivy itch creams, or baths to relieve discomfort, though {{recent studies have shown}} some traditional medicines to be ineffective. Over-the-counter products to ease itching—or simply oatmeal baths and baking soda—are now recommended by dermatologists for the treatment of poison ivy.A plant-based remedy cited to counter urushiol-induced contact dermatitis is jewelweed, and a jewelweed mash made from the living plant was effective in reducing poison ivy dermatitis, supporting ethnobotanical use, while jewelweed extracts had no positive effect in clinical studies. Others argue that prevention of lesions is easy if one practices effective washing, using plain soap, scrubbing with <b>a</b> <b>washcloth,</b> and rinsing three times within two to eight hours of exposure.|$|E
5000|$|This {{intelligent}} bird has {{a playful}} personality and a colourful appearance. They're {{often described as}} flamboyant, theatrical and pugnacious birds. [...] The subspecies, Buru red lory (Eos bornea cyanonothus) is darker, more maroon in colour, and is often confused in captivity with the nominate. Inadvertent interbreeding between the two subspecies has made a clear identification difficult for pet owners as hybrids can be found. The other two subspecies are not as common, Rothschild's red lory (Eos bornea rothschildi) and Bernstein's red lory (Eos bornea bernsteini). Lories are very intelligent, trainable, affectionate, playful and curious and they can display some interesting behaviors. For example, some lories have wrapped themselves in <b>a</b> <b>washcloth</b> for sleeping or some sleep on their backs with their feet up in the air. When kept as a pet, they should be given toys (ropes, bells, balls, swings), chewing items and branches. They require lots of attention and care. They should be bathed frequently in a bird bath, bowl or shower, {{and they can be}} dried by the sun or by a blow drier. A moderate amount of their feathers should be clipped to prevent them from flying. Young birds must be socialized and exposed to new people and new things (new cages, toys, vet visits, wing and nail clippings). Outdoor housing is preferred, but if housed in cages, the cages must be large and cleaned often. They may be kept alone or with others, as long as they're closely monitored for signs of aggression. Mated pairs defend their territories forcefully.|$|E
5000|$|The drug {{addiction}} of Towelie, {{a living and}} talking towel, is growing so overwhelming that the South Park children make attempts to help him.

The patient was {{referred}} to a feeding clinic and required 3 weeks of nasogastric tube feeds. She continued to grow well, nevertheless, and when 4 months old, she had a weight of 6. 63 kg (75 th per-centile) and a length of 62. 0 cm (50 th percentile) (Figure 1). At this point, she was seen by the plastic surgery team, with the lesion measuring 4 × 4 cm and spanning from the right commisure to the midline (Figure 2).

40|$|Dairy herds in Ohio were {{selected}} by {{stratified random sampling}} for participation in a disease-monitoring study to relate S. agalactiae intramammmary prevalence to herd management and environmental conditions. Of 48 herds studied, 27 herds had at least 1 cow infected with this pathogen. Management and environmental conditions were assessed by direct observation {{as well as by}} an interview with the dairy producers. One-way ANOVA or chi superscript 2 analysis, with presence or absence of S. agalactiae as the dependent variable, was used to test each of 70 independent variables. Variables found significant at P < 0. 20 were further evaluated by use of logistic regression. This sample size permitted only 4 independent variables to be simultaneously evaluated by logistic regression. The most predictive risk factors were identified as poor teat and udder hygiene, poor environmental sanitation, large herd population, and use of <b>a</b> shared <b>washcloth</b> for premilking cleaning of teats and udders. ...|$|R
