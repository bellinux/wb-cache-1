40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} {{the use of}} high energy ultrasound as an alternative energy for angioplasty, an experimental ultrasonic <b>angioplasty</b> <b>device</b> was developed. The device was studied in two bioassay systems: an in vitro system for the disruption of atherosclerotic plaques and thrombi and an in vivo system for the recanalization of occluded canine femoral arteries. In vitro, sonication efficiently reduced {{the size of the}} plaques. Atheromatous plaques (n = 11) disrupted at a rate of 21 ± 8 s/cm 2; complicated plaques (n = 14) disrupted at a rate of 132 ± 45 s/CM 2 (p < 0. 001). Histologic examination revealed that the disruption of the plaques took place without concurrent damage to the media or adventitia. Ninety percent of the disrupted plaque debris had a diameter of < 20 μm and was composed primarily of cholesterol monohydrate crystals. Solid thrombus (n = 5) weight was reduced from 1. 6 ± 0. 2 to 0. 4 ± 0. 1 (p< 0. 0001) after 20 s of sonication. In vivo, sonication resulted in recanalization in all seven arteries tested in seven dogs. The obstruction was reduced from 93 ± 11 % to 18 ± 7 % (p < 0. 001). On histologic examination, the arterial wall injury index was found to be 1. 56 ± 0. 42 in the test arteries compared with 1. 37 ± 0. 47 in the control arteries (p = NS). The disruption of atherosclerotic plaques and thrombi, together with the efficient recanalization of the occluded arteries, demonstrates the potential of ultrasound angioplasty as a catheter-based technique for angioplasty. The histologic findings suggest that the ultrasonic <b>angioplasty</b> <b>device</b> selectively disrupts the ultrasound-sensitive atherosclerotic plaques and thrombi, with minimal damage to the ultrasound-resistant arterial wall...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to characterize the immediate alterations induced by angioplasty and to compare the results of the application of two types of balloons. Ten porcine renal arteries were dilated with a compliant balloon, and ten with a non-compliant balloon. After angioplastic treatment arterial specimens were wax embedded for light microscopy. Sections were stained with the orcein-Van Gieson method, orcein, haematoxylin-eosin, and PAS. Image analysis was performed taking into consideration the following parameters: thickness of the entire wall, of the tunica media and of the inner elastic lamina. The major axes of the smooth muscle cells nuclei were also measured. The effects of the two types of balloon resulted in changes consisting in thinning of the entire arterial wall, reduction of the tunica media, distension of reticular fibers, presence of wide spaces between smooth muscle cells, stretching of smooth muscle cells, inner elastic lamina thickening. Both <b>angioplasty</b> <b>devices</b> used can modify the vascular wall.

This study examined the changes in platelet adherence and thrombus formation on freshly harvested atherosclerotic aorta segments from Watanabe-heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits after ablation by two pulsed laser sources (308 -nm xenon chloride excimer and 2, 940 -nm erbium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet [YAG] lasers) and a prototype catalytic hot-tip catheter. Specimens were placed in a modified Baumgartner annular chamber and perfused with citrated whole human blood, followed by quantitative morphometric analysis to determine the percent surface coverage by adherent platelets and thrombi in the treated and contiguous control areas. Pulsed excimer laser ablation of plaque did not change platelet adherence or thrombus formation in the treated versus control zones. However, photothermal plaque ablation with a pulsed erbium: YAG laser resulted in a 67 % reduction in platelet adherence, compared with levels in control areas (from 16. 7 ± 2. 2 % to 5. 5 ± 1. 8 %; p < 0. 005). Similarly, after plaque ablation using a catalytic thermal angioplasty device, there was a 74 % reduction in platelet adherence (from 29. 2 ± 5. 1 % to 7. 7 ± 1. 6 %; p < 0. 005) and a virtual absence of platelet thrombi (from 8. 6 ± 2. 3 % to 0. 03 ± 0. 03 %; p < 0. 095). This reduced surface thrombogenicity after plaque ablation with either an erbium: YAG laser or a catalytic hot-tip catheter suggests that thermal modifications in the arterial surface ultrastructure or thermal denaturation of surface proteins, or both, {{may be responsible for}} reduced platelet adherence. These in vitro findings indicate that controlled thermal plaqae ablation by catheter-based techniques may elicit endovascular responses that can reduce early thrombus formation during angioplasty procedures...|$|E

We have previously shown that ultrasound energy (20 kHz) delivered by a wire probe produces dose-dependent, endothelium-independent smooth muscle relaxation capable or reversing both receptor-mediated and voltage-dependent vasoconstriction in vitro. Methods. A high intensity, low frequency ultrasound catheter system was used to recanalize total occlusions in the superficial femoral arteries of two patients. After recanalization, the proximal residual stenoses were each < 15 %. However, distal arterial vasospasm was found angiographically in a popliteal artery of one patient and in an anterior tibial artery of another. Subsequently, the ultrasound catheter probe was advanced to the sites of arterial vasospasm (diffuse in one, focal in one). Results. After 30 and 90 s, respectively, of exposure to ultrasound energy with a frequency of 19. 5 kHz, peak tip amplitude of 111 μm and power output at the transducer of 25 W, the vasospasm resolved in each arterial segment. Conclusions. Our findings are the first reported clinical cases documenting that catheter-delivered low frequency, high intensity ultrasound induces arterial vasodilation at the site of vasoconstriction.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{effect of}} {{atherosclerosis}} {{is well documented}} and many procedures such as balloon angioplasty and stentimplantation {{have been developed to}} reopen occluded arteries. However, there are considerable differences in the material properties of various atherosclerotic lesions as they develop. Many authors have suggested that rigid calcified plaques may require specific procedures that target this rigid material through de-bulking or complete removal (Salunke et al, 1997). Ultrasound angioplasty is the delivery of high power low frequency ultrasound via a wire waveguide to the lesion location. This results in distal tip wire displacements of up to 100 um peak-to-peak (p-p) at frequencies of between 20 - 45 kHz (Atar, 1999 and Yock, 1997). Ultrasound angioplasty was shown to be effective in the ablation of fibrous and calcified blockages in arteries (Siegel, 1993). At the displacements and frequencies mentioned the pressure field developed can produce disruptive cavitations around the distal tip (Gavin et al, 2004). The principal objective {{of this study was to}} develop an ultrasound <b>angioplasty</b> <b>device</b> and investigate its performance characteristics both experimentally and numerically. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ultrasound was generated by a piezoelectric transducer driven by an ultrasonic generator. The ultrasonic generator drives the transducer at its resonant frequency, in the case of the present device, 22. 5 kHz with output displacements of between 3 - 18 um (p-p). This output was passed into an acoustic horn with a wire waveguide attached to the distal end. These amplify the displacement characteristics and the waveguide has a working flexibility similar to present balloon catheters and a working length of approximately 500 mm. The wire waveguide was ensheathed in a catheter with the distal end of the wire protruding at the tip. The output (p-p) displacements at the distal end of the wire waveguide were measured using an optical microscope with video acquisition and measurement. The characteristics of the system along the length of the wire waveguide have also been numerically simulated using FEA RESULTS The output displacement characteristics of the wire waveguide showed achievable peak-to-peak output displacements of 15 - 90 um (p-p) at 22. 5 kHz. Fig. 1 shows an image obtained by the optical measurement system of the distal tip of a 1 mm wire waveguide subjected to ultrasonic energy. DISCUSSION This initial testing of tip displacements has proved promising and the comparison of the FEA and experimental results has shown good agreement. Future studies involve identifying cavitations and testing is to be carried out on various materials that simulate plaque with a focus on rigid calcified lesions...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundCarotid {{angioplasty}} and stenting {{can be used}} in stroke prevention {{in high-risk}} patients. As embolic complications can occur during carotid angioplasty and stenting, a device was developed to protect from cerebral embolization. MethodsBetween September 1999 and May 2002, carotid angioplasty and stenting was performed in 100 patients (84 men; mean age, 69. 2 years) with symptomatic (26 %) or asymptomatic (74 %) severe carotid artery stenosis. Wallstents were used in all cases with selective pre-dilatation. Cerebral protection devices (Parodi Anti-Emboli System [PAES], ArteriA, San Francisco, Calif) were used in all patients. All patients were evaluated by a neurologist, {{both before and after the}} procedure. According to the criteria set forth by the large trials, the occurrence of minor, major or fatal stroke and myocardial infarction (end points) within 30 days and follow-up were determined as end points. Data were collected prospectively. ResultsThe overall perioperative stroke and death rate was 3 % (1 noncorresponding minor stroke, 1 hemorrhagic stroke, and 1 cardiac event). Four patients developed postoperative transient neurologic events (three related to hemodynamic instability and the fourth due to postoperative embolization). The overall technical success rate for carotid <b>angioplasty</b> (protection <b>device</b> placed in position percutaneously) was 99 %.

The overall incidence of abrupt closure was 3. 9 % (78 / 1983), with 2. 1 % (42 / 78) occurring during the procedure and 1. 8 % (36 / 78) occurring out-of-Iab (1 patient with both inand out-of-Iab abrupt closure). Among NDA, TEC (14. 8 %) and stents (8. 3 %) had relatively higher frequencies of abrupt closure {{compared to other}} NDAs (mean of 3. 5 %).

40|$|Improved {{medical and}} {{surgical}} therapies for children withcongenital heart disease {{have resulted in}} a growing popu-lation of patients reaching adulthood. 1, 2 Over this same time, the field of interventional cardiology has experienced signif-icant growth, driven by technological improvements and better understanding of the mechanisms and intermediate-term results of individual procedures. Consequently, for adults with uncorrected or previously palliated congenital heart disease, percutaneous therapies have increasing accep-tance as reasonable additions, alternatives, and treatments of choice when further surgical or medical intervention is contemplated (Table 1). Currently, interventional cardiology of adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) is a well-established field on its own and, programmatically, is a fundamental component of any center providing care for these patients. 3 Although limited safety of interventional procedures for the ACHD population has been suggested in centers without ACHD global care programs, 4 the wide variation in clinical presentation, novelty of cardiovascular pathologies (with similarity to as well as marked differences from both congenital and acquired conditions), and potential for concomitant multiple organ system pathology all contrib-ute to situations atypical for standard adult or pediatric laboratories. These concerns, combined with a desire to centralize data collection to establish outcomes assessments for ACHD patients considered for interventional catheteriza-tion, lead to the recommendation that such procedures be performed in centers with ACHD expertise and established care programs. 3 In this article, we review the most commonly performed percutaneous procedures in ACHD, including valvuloplasty, <b>angioplasty,</b> and <b>device</b> closures.

40|$|Percutaneous transluminal {{angioplasty}} (PTA) {{is becoming}} widely {{used as a}} primary treatment in peripheral and coronary atherosclerotic disease. Dilatation of stenoses by a transluminal balloon is effective acutely in over 90 % of appropriate lesions, but {{is associated with a}} significant rate of complications. Abrupt reclosure of treated sites occurs in approximately 5 % of cases, as a result of medial dissections, thrombosis and arterial spasm. Subacute reclosure affects a further group of patients in the days or weeks after the procedure, probably from propagation of thrombus or delayed elastic recoil of the vessel. The most significant problem, however, is that of delayed restenosis of the artery, occurring three to twelve months after angioplasty. This appears to be due to proliferation of medial myocytes, as a response to mitogens released from platelets that adhere to exposed connective tissue at the site of balloon trauma. The resultant lesion is known as myointimal hyperplasia and can bulge into the lumen, causing restenosis or occlusion of the vessel. Various devices utilizing thermal energy (mostly laser powered) have been used for angioplasty, and some have shown signs of reducing acute reclosure by "sealing" dissections and producing a relatively non-thrombogenic luminal surface. One modality involves the use of simultaneous balloon dilatation and application of thermal energy via laser emissions through a transparent angioplasty balloon. This theoretically has the effect of fusing dissections in the arterial wall, and has been shown to produce long-lasting, stable dilatations at the treatment site. Penetrating laser thermal energy is however difficult to control because of its scatter in tissue, and stringent safety precautions are required in its use. Evidence derived from the use of lasers to perform arterial anastomoses suggests that careful control of temperature and lesion size are essential to avoid excessive thermal injury to vessels. Radiofrequency (RF) energy {{has a long history of}} safe medical application in electrosurgical devices. A bipolar RF thermal angioplasty system was created by applying a thin layer of gold to the surface of a conventional angioplasty balloon. In order to assess the possible application of this system as a thermal <b>angioplasty</b> <b>device,</b> a number of preliminary in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed. These showed that RF energy produced strong fusion of apposed arterial tissue in vivo and fused artificially created medial dissections in vitro. In vitro immersion of the energised RF balloon in blood produced no evidence of thrombo-embolic effects, and adventitial temperatures recorded in vivo with transluminal RF thermal angioplasty were in a range of 46 - 83 °C with a mean of 61. 2 °C that avoided profound thermal damage. An animal study was performed, with groups of dogs receiving RF thermal angioplasty in three of four arterial sites, with the fourth receiving conventional balloon angioplasty as a control. Angiography after the procedure showed the presence of dilatations at the RF sites, while spasm, which was a feature of control angioplasty sites, was abolished in RF-treated vessel segments. Repeat angiography prior to animal sacrifice at two, four and eight weeks showed persisting dilatations at the RF sites. Histological examination of the thermally treated sites showed initial medial cell death, with orderly repopulation of the media by eight weeks by what appeared to be smooth muscle cells. Myointimal hyperplasia, which was present diffusely along the control angioplasty-treated segments, was limited to the ends of the thermally treated segments where the thermal effect of the RF electrode configuration was negligible. It appears therefore that thermal angioplasty with an RF balloon system may have benefits in reducing abrupt reclosure by fusing mural dissections and preventing arterial spasm, that it reduces the likelihood of delayed elastic recoil, and that it may have an advantageous effect on the pattern of arterial healing...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} qualitative or quantitative variables present on angioscopy, intravascular ultrasound imaging or quantitative coronary arteriography that were associated with adverse clinical outcome after coronary intervention in high risk patients. Background. Patients with acute coronary syndromes and complex lesion morphology on angiography are at increased risk for acute complications after coronary <b>angioplasty.</b> Newer <b>devices</b> that primarily remove atheroma have not improved outcome over that of balloon angioplasty. Intravascular imaging can accurately identify intraluminal and intramural histopathologic features not adequately visualized during coronary arteriography and may provide mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of abrupt closure and restenosis. Methods. Sixty high risk patients with unstable coronary syndromes and complex lesions on angiography underwent angioscopy (n = 40) and intravascular ultrasound imaging (n = 46) during interventional procedures. In 26 patients, both angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound were performed in the same lesion. All patients underwent off-line quantitative coronary arteriography. Coronary interventions included balloon (n = 21) and excimer laser (n = 4) angioplasty, directional (n = 19) and rotational (n = 6) atherectomy and stent implantation (n = 11). Patients were followed up for 1 year for objective evidence of recurrent ischemia. Results. Patients whose clinical presentation included rest angina or acute myocardial infarction or who received thrombolytic therapy within 24 h of procedure were significantly more likely to experience recurrent ischemia after intervention. Plaque rupture or thrombus on preprocedure angioscopy or angioscopic thrombus after intervention were also significantly associated with adverse outcome. Qualitative or quantitative variables on angiography, intravascular ultrasound of off-line quantitative arteriography were not associated with recurrent ischemia on univariate analysis. Multivariate predictors of recurrent ischemia were plaque rupture on preprocedure angioscopy (p < 0. 05, odds ratio [OR] 10. 15) and angioscopic thrombus after intervention (p < 0. 05, OR 7. 26).

The aim {{of this article is to}} examine the evidence in published literature on the use of drug-eluting devices in the treatment of peripheral arterial diseases. A systematic literature review was undertaken of all published literature on this subject using Medline and cross-referenced. All published relevant articles on the use of drug-eluting stents and balloons in peripheral arterial disease were used. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and electronic databases were also searched for on-going studies. Published results from randomised studies such as the SIROCCO I and II Trials and the THUNDER study, together with single cohort studies, are now available.

40|$|A {{sapphire}} {{contact probe}} laser catheter {{was developed to}} increase the dimensions of tunnels created by laser <b>angioplasty.</b> The <b>device</b> consisted of a round sapphire probe (2. 2 mm diameter) attached to an 8 F catheter into which a 0. 2 mm optical fiber was inserted with a tip maintained at 3 mm from the sapphire. The fiber was connected to a continuous wave neodymium yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd-YAG) laser. A saline perfusate was circulated through the catheter during laser emissions to prevent excessive heating of the fiber tip. The system was used in vitro on 16 sections of atherosclerotic calcified human cadaver aortic walls, using diluted blood as a medium, at powers ranging from 10 to 40 W and exposure times from 1 to 4 seconds. Six craters were created at each energy level. The system was also used on six human cadaver, agar-embedded, obstructed iliac and femoral arteries, using 40 W and 2 second laser emissions. Dimensions of probe-created craters were compared with those obtained using bare fibers. The shape of the probe craters {{was that of a}} trun- cated cone with the entry hole wider than the exit, as opposed to the cylindrical shape created with unmodified bare fibers. At 120 J (seconds × watts), areas of entry and exit probe-formed holes were greater than those created with the bare fibers (6. 7 ± 0. 5 and 3. 4 ± 0. 6 versus 0. 2 ± 0. 01 mm 2, respectively, p < 0. 001). The tissue ablation velocity of the probe was 20 times that of the bare fiber (0. 5 ± 0. 1 versus 10. 3 ± 1. 0 mm 3, at 40 W for 2 seconds, p < 0. 001). There was a thin rim of carbonization {{at the edges of the}} craters similar to that created with bare fibers. Tissue adherence on the sapphire was reduced with 1 second exposure times. No alterations in the structure of the fiber tip were found using the probe catheter as opposed to bare fibers. This laser delivery system is superior to bare fibers and is able to create large holes without either excessive thermal injury to the arterial wall or damage to the optical fiber tip...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Balloon-expandable coronary-artery stents were {{developed}} to prevent coronary restenosis after coronary <b>angioplasty.</b> These <b>devices</b> hold coronary vessels open at sites that have been dilated. However, it is unknown whether stenting improves long-term angiographic and clinical outcomes as compared with standard balloon angioplasty. METHODS: A total of 520 patients with stable angina and a single coronary-artery lesion {{were randomly assigned to}} either stent implantation (262 patients) or standard balloon angioplasty (258 patients). The primary clinical end points were death, the occurrence of a cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, the need for coronary-artery bypass surgery, or a second percutaneous intervention involving the previously treated lesion, either {{at the time of the}} initial procedure or during the subsequent seven months. The primary angiographic end point was the minimal luminal diameter at follow-up, as determined by quantitative coronary angiography. RESULTS: After exclusions, 52 patients in the stent group (20 percent) and 76 patients in the angioplasty group (30 percent) reached a primary clinical end point (relative risk, 0. 68; 95 percent confidence interval, 0. 50 to 0. 92; P = 0. 02). The difference in clinical-event rates was explained mainly by a reduced need for a second coronary angioplasty in the stent group (relative risk, 0. 58; 95 percent confidence interval, 0. 40 to 0. 85; P = 0. 005). The mean (+/- SD) minimal luminal diameters immediately after the procedure were 2. 48 +/- 0. 39 mm in the stent group and 2. 05 +/- 0. 33 mm in the angioplasty group; at follow-up, the diameters were 1. 82 +/- 0. 64 mm in the stent group and 1. 73 +/- 0. 55 mm in the angioplasty group (P = 0. 09), which correspond to rates of restenosis (diameter of stenosis, > or = 50 percent) of 22 and 32 percent, respectively (P = 0. 02). Peripheral vascular complications necessitating surgery, blood transfusion, or both were more frequent after stenting than after balloon angioplasty (13. 5 vs. 3. 1 percent, P < 0. 001). The mean hospital stay was significantly longer in the stent group than in the angioplasty group (8. 5 vs. 3. 1 days, P < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Over seven months of follow-up, the clinical and angiographic outcomes were better in patients who received a stent than in those who received standard coronary angioplasty. However, this benefit was achieved at the cost of a significantly higher risk of vascular complications at the access site and a longer hospital stay. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{long term}} benefit of {{elective}} Palmaz-Schatz stent implantation for focal lesions in large vessels has been clearly delineated. The elective use of stents in diffuse disease. however, {{has not been}} fully evaluated. This study reports {{on the use of}} stents in 89 pts with 108 lesions (les) with diffuse disease. Diffuse disease was defined as a lesion length longer than 20 mm. After a successful angiographic result was obtained. intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) was performed to confirm optimal stent expansion and lesion coverage and to guide further balloon dilation and stent implantation. The mean age was 57 ± 10. Mean lesion length was 32 ± 6 mm. Vessel distribution was 51 LAD (47 %). 45 RCA (42 %). 10 LCX (9 %). and 2 vein graft(2 %). Lesion location was 49 proximal (45 %). 52 mid (48 %), and 7 distal (7 %). 274 stents were implanted (139 Palmaz-Schatz, 34 short (7 mm) Palmaz-Schatz, 48 GianturcoRoubin, and 53 Wiktor) for an average of 2. 4 ± 1. 4 stents/lesion. Procedure success was achieved in 83 patients (93 %). Procedure associated complications included 3 myocardial infarction (3 %) and 3 emergency bypass (3 %) and 1 elective bypass (1 %). Following the procedure. 77 pts (93 %) with 94 les were treated only with anti platelet therapy and no anticoagulation. Angiographic follow up at 4 – 6 months was performed on 49 of the eligible 65 lesions (71 %). Baseline, final and follow up angiographic (AG) results are below:AG ResultsReference (mm) MLD(mm) % StenosisBaseline 3. 11 ± 0. 470. 66 ± 0. 5879 ± 19 Post Stent 309 ± 0. 503. 01 ± 0. 473 ± 12 Follow Up 3. 01 ± 0. 481. 80 ± 0. 9140 ± 28 There was 1 acute stent thrombosis event (1. 2 %).

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this plenary paper deals with the application of experimental techniques to medical devices used {{in the treatment of}} vascular disease. Vascular disease is a medical condition where fatty material narrows the artery. It is reported that over 4 million deaths {{can be attributed to the}} disease each year in Europe alone. Vascular disease can occur at locations throughout the arterial network. A blockage located in the carotid artery can cause what is known as a stroke, or if located in one of coronary arteries may lead to a heart attack. A major advance in the treatment of the disease was made when the Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) was introduced by Gruntzig [5] in 1977. The procedure offered a non-invasive, cost effective and rapid treatment for cardiovascular disease and was soon adapted to treat diseased vessels elsewhere in the body. During a typical procedure access to the vascular system is gained via the femoral artery at the groin. From this point a cardiologist uses endovascular techniques to navigate a catheter, with a polymer balloon deflated and tightly wrapped around its tip, through the artery network to the site of the blockage. The balloon is positioned across the blockage and is momentarily inflated. As the balloon inflates it exerts a radial force on the accumulated atherosclerotic plaque material, displacing it and thereby restoring patency to the vessel. Angioplasty balloons are used at locations throughout the arterial network and therefore range in size depending on the intended site of operation. They are typically constructed from rigid polymeric materials and are designed to exhibit low compliance at inflation high pressures; the balloon material is anisotropic. Fig. 1 shows a commercially available balloon. Studies have found the incidence of restenosis post angioplasty to be as high as 30 - 50 %. To combat thisa fine mesh, metallic, cylindrical component known as a intravascular stent may be implanted as a follow up procedure to the <b>angioplasty.</b> The <b>device</b> is permanently implanted and acts as a scaffold within the artery (see Fig. 2). Two principal categories of stents exist: balloon expandable and self-expanding. The former are plastically deformed into position using an angioplasty balloon and are typically constructed from a stainless steel alloy. The latter, self-expanding stents (see Fig. 2) are deployed from the tip of a catheter and expand elastically into position, to provide support to the vessel wall. Self-expanding stents are constructed from a NiTi alloy commonly known as Nitinol. Nitinol is classed as a superelastic material as it can elastically recover strains in excess of 8 % via a stress induced (reversible) transformation from a parent austenite microstructure to a martensitic phase. The stress-strain curve follows a non-linear path with significant thermal variations occurring as the material undergoes the phase change. Thermoelastic Stress Analysis (TSA) [1] is a non-contacting technique that provides full field stress information and can record high-resolution measurements from small structures. The work presented in this paper summarises the application of TSA to angioplasty balloons and Nitinol vascular stents carried out at the University of Southampton [2 - 6] and identifies the significant challenges in apply the technique to such devices. The use of high resolution optics is described along with a calibration methodology that allows quantitative stress measurements to be taken from the balloon structure. The paper then describes new work that assesses the effect of geometrical variations on balloon performance. Typical data from a balloon is shown in Figure 3. A brief account of a study undertaken to characterise the thermoelastic response from Nitinol is also included and it is demonstrated that thermoelastic data can be obtained from a stent at high resolutions (see Figure 4). Further work on stents conducted at body temperature is described...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. A new {{percutaneous}} collagen hemostasis {{device was}} compared with conventional compression techniques after diagnostic catheterization and angioplasty. Background. Peripheral vascular complications diagnostic catheterization or more complex interventional procedures, {{as well as}} the discomfort of manual compression and prolonged bed rest, represent significant morbidity for invasive cardiac procedures. Methods. A prospective, multicenter, randomized trial was designed to compare the hemostasis time in minutes and the incidence of vascular complications in patients receiving a vascular hemostasis device with those undergoing conventional compression techniques. Results. After diagnostic catheterization, hemostasis time was significantly less with the vascular hemostasis device than with conventional manual compression (4. 1 ± 2. 8 min [n = 90 patients] vs. 17. 6 ± 9. 2 min [n = 75], p < 0. 0001). This difference was greater in patients undergoing angioplasty and was unrelated to the anticoagulation states (4. 3 ± 3. 7 min [n = 71 not receiving heparin], 7. 6 ± 11. 6 min [n = 85 receiving heparin], 33. 6 ± 24. 2 min [n = 134 control patients not receiving heparin], p < 0. 0001 vs. control patients). The time {{from the start of the}} procedure to ambulation was slightly less after diagnostic catheterization in patients treated with the device (13. 3 ± 12. 1 h vs. 19. 2 ± 17. 8 h, p < 0. 05). It was also less in patients who underwent <b>angioplasty</b> when the <b>device</b> was used after discontinuation of anticoagulation (23. 0 ± 11. 1 h, without heparin), as compared with control compression techniques (32. 7 ± 18. 8 h, p < 0. 0001). Time to ambulation was even shorter (16. 1 ± 11. 1 h, p < 0. 0001) in patients in whom the device was placed immediately after angioplasty while they were still fully anticoagulated with a prolonged activated clotting time (336 ± 85 s). There were no major complications (surgery or transfusion) after diagnostic catheterization and a low incidence of major complications in patients who underwent angioplasty (0. 7 % in control patients, 1. 4 % with the device without heparin, 1. 2 % with the device and heparin, p = NS). After angioplasty, there was a trend toward fewer hematomas when the device was used in the absence of heparin (4. 2 % vs. 9. 7 % in control patients, p = 0. 14). Conclusions. A new vascular hemostasis device can significantly reduce the puncture site hemostasis time and the time to ambulation without significantly increasing the risk of peripheral vascular complications. The role of this technology in reducing complications, length of hospital stay and cost remains to be determined...|$|R
40|$|Stents are {{rigid and}} {{perforated}} tubular structures, which are inserted into {{blood vessels in}} order to prevent or inhibit the constriction of blood flow, restoring the normal blood flow, when blood vessels are clogged, being used in 70 % of <b>angioplasties.</b> These medical <b>devices</b> assume great importance in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) which are {{the leading cause of death}} worldwide. In the European Union CVD account for 40 % of deaths and assume an estimated annual cost of 196 billion euros[1]. Stents must possess certain requirements, in order to, adequately, perform its function, such as biocompatibility (so that its use does not c ause damage on the health of its user), mechanical strength, radiopacity (so that it is easy to view), longitudinal flexibility, ease of handling, corrosion resistance and having high strength and high radial expansion ability to recover. Stents can be made of different materials, but metals, particularly stainless steel, are the most common. However, metallic stents present several dRawbacks such as corrosion and restenosis, leading to health complications for the patient, or even death. In order to minimize these disadvantages, new materials, like fibrous materials, have been used [2]. Monofilaments present high potential for stents development because, in addition to its biocompatibility, these materials allow the application of various surface treatments, such as antibacterial coatings. Furthermore, monofilament exhibit excellent mechanical properties, like greater stiffness and good results when subjected to compression, tensile and bending forces, since these forces will be directly supported by the monofilament [3]. To minimize the reaction of the human body and Limit the adhesion of microorganisms to the stent surface, some coatings have been developed, including the use of novel metals with antimicrobial properties, like silver. The main objective of this study was the development of fibrous stents, incorporation of silver oxide nanocoating. For the development of the stent, polyester monofilaments with 0. 27 mm of diameter were used in braiding technology, with a mandrel diameter of 6 mm and a braiding angle of 35 ⁰. The mechanical behaviour of the stent were evaluated by mechanical testing under longitudinal and radial compression, bending. The results of compressive strength tests are according with value from literature: 1. 13 to 2. 9 N for radial compression and 0. 16 - 5. 28 N to longitudinal compression. From literature is also possible to verify that stents must present 75 % of unchanged diameter during the bending test and must possess a porosity between 70 % and 80 % [4]. The produced polyester stent presents values of 1. 29 N for radial compression, 0. 23 N for longitudinal compression, 80 % of porosity and 85. 5 % of unchanged diameter, during bending tests. For the antibacterial functionalization, silver oxide nanocoatings were prepared, through reactive magnetron g, with an Ag target in an Ar +O 2 atmosphere. In order to evaluate the nanostructure and morphology of the coatings, d ifferent technique s like X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and and X- ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS were used. From the analyses of XRD it is possible to verify that the peaks corresponds to planes of Ag 2 O and MATERIAIS 2015 Porto, 21 - 23 June, 2015 characterize a cubic phase. The presence of Ag 2 O is corroborated by XPS spectrum, where it is possible to observe silver, not only, in oxide state, but a lso in mettalic state, and it is possible to verify the presence of silver clusters, confirmed by SEM analysis. Films’ roughness and topography, parameters influencing the wettability of the surface and microorganism adhesion, were measured by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and it was observed that the roughness is very low (under 10 nm). Coatings’ hydrophobicity and surface tension parameters were determined by contact angle measurement, and it was verified the hydrophobic behavior of the coatings. For antibacterial tests were used Staphylococcus epidermidis strain (IE 186) and Staphylococcus aureus(ATCC 6538), and halo inhibition zone tests were realized. Ag+release rates were studied by means of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP -MS). The obtained results suggest that silver oxide coatings do not modify significantly surface properties of the substrate, like hydrophobicity and roughness, and present antimicrobial properties for both bacteria used...|$|R
40|$|Minimally {{invasive}} implantable {{medical devices}} represent a major {{advance in the}} treatment of obstructive coronary artery disease with stent implantation becoming the standard coronary <b>angioplasty</b> procedure. Such <b>devices</b> interact with tissues at their surfaces and therefore surface quality can alter the delivery and performance of the device and can affect factors such as the adhesion of drug eluting coatings, biocompatibility and friction. Laser Induced Periodic Surface Structures (LIPSS) are ripples created on the surface of a material after ultra-short laser material interaction. Applications include improved drug coating adhesion, increased surface area and surface energy of devices, altered hydrophilic/hydrophobic performance on a surface, and modified cell growth. This study investigates the evolution of LIPSS generated on biomedical alloy materials and includes understanding the formation of nanostructures and also the biological response of cells. The work focuses on three questions: â¢	 How does material reflectivity affect the material response and specifically the incubation coefficient? â¢	 How do nanostructures develop with increasing number of laser pulses? â¢	 What is the biological response on cardiac stents? LIPSS were generated by applying femtosecond pulses, with a 500 fs pulse duration at a repetition rate of 100 kHz, to smooth polished 316 LSS and Pt:SS (roughness Ra value of 2. 9 Â± 0. 2 nm and 1. 5 Â± 0. 2 nm respectively) cardiac stent surfaces. Exposing the sample to laser radiation slightly above the damage threshold fluence allows the formation of LIPSS structures. In order to create different periodic topographies, experiments were performed at two different laser wavelengths, 515 nm and 1030 nm. The LIPSS period and depth increased with increasing laser wavelength from a period of 388. 7 Â± 9. 0 nm and depth of 86. 1 Â± 1. 7 nm at a wavelength of 515 nm to 740. 0 Â± 13. 9 nm and 177 Â± 5. 2 nm at a wavelength of 1030 nm. The role of reflectivity in multiple pulse incubation was investigated on the surface of Pt:SS, 316 LSS and bulk Au. By using fluences below the damage threshold of the material, reflectivity measurements were performed on samples that were modified using multiple pulses. The study found that the incubation coefficient significantly increases with successive pulses when reflectivity is taken into account. In the case of Pt:SS, an incubation parameter was estimated to be 0. 75 Â± 0. 02 and 0. 79 Â± 0. 03 but when reflectivity was incorporated, increased to 0. 90 Â± 0. 02 and 1. 02 Â± 0. 03, at 515 nm and 1030 nm, respectively. This result highlights the important role of reflectivity in incubation and provides new insights into the laser material interaction of alloys. The topography of LIPSS was characterised using high-resolution techniques such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Focused Ion Beam (FIB), X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The initial exposure to femtosecond pulses induces nanostructures such as nanopillars, nanoparticles and bridges, on the material surface. As the number of pulses increases, LIPSS form alongside these nanostructures and it is believed that these nanostructures contribute to the onset of LIPSS formation. It was also found using FIB that there is no change in the grain structure after LIPSS formation. An examination of the crystal structure of Pt:SS using TEM revealed no change in the crystallinity of the material with the formation of LIPSS, a useful property in medical device applications. The interaction of cells with a biomaterial is affected by the surface charge, chemistry, nano-topography and curvature of the surface. Cells attach to the surface through adhesion proteins, such as collagen, fibronectin, vitronectin and laminin. An in vitro biological study examined the response of monocytes (cells that circulate in the blood), fibroblasts (cells located in connective tissue) and endothelial cells (cells lining the interior surface of blood vessels) to LIPSS on Pt:SS and 316 LSS coronary stents with surface roughness Ra values ranging from 29 nm to 50 nm. Varying bio-responses were observed for different cell lines and roughness values. Monocytes show a high affinity to bare un-textured surfaces but failed to firmly attach onto textured surfaces. Fibroblast cells did not adhere to un-textured surfaces but formed a monolayer on LIPSS surfaces with roughness values of approximately 50 nm indicating that the LIPSS surface supports adhesion after 24 hours. Endothelial cells did not attach to either un-textured or textured surfaces. However, it is likely that endothelial cells could attach onto LIPSS surfaces that have a roughness value outside the parameters used in this study. A deeper understanding of LIPSS formation and biological interaction of various biomaterials is useful in the development of new technologies. Laser-structured surfaces with various topographies can offer new bio-functionalities in the area of medical implants both in coronary applications and other surface-contacting devices such as orthopaedic joint replacements...|$|R
