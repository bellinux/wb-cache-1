5|$|As Scott's men {{reached an}} open prairie near the Wea {{settlement}} of Ouiatenon on June 1, they were discovered by an enemy scout <b>and</b> <b>hurried</b> <b>to</b> attack the villages before the residents could react. When the main force reached the villages, {{they found the}} residents hurriedly fleeing across the Wabash River in canoes. Aided by cover fire from a Kickapoo village {{on the other side}} of the river, they were able to escape before Scott's men could attack. The river was too wide to ford at Scott's location, so he sent a detachment under James Wilkinson in one direction and a detachment under Thomas Barbee in the other to find a place to ford the river. Wilkinson did not find a suitable location, but located and killed a small band of Indians before returning. Barbee located a crossing and conducted a brief raid against the Indians on the other side before returning to Scott. The next morning, Scott's main force burned the nearby villages and crops, while a detachment under Wilkinson set out for the settlement of Kethtippecannunk. The inhabitants of this village had fled across Eel Creek, and after a brief and ineffective firefight, Wilkinson's men burned the city and returned to Scott. In his official report, Scott noted that many of Kethtippecannunk's residents were French and speculated that it was connected to, perhaps dependent upon, the French settlement of Detroit.|$|E

25|$|The {{advantage}} of having two {{is that it}} allows preparation for an emergency. While one of the submersibles is conducting its dive, the other remains at readiness should there be an emergency, needing to be boarded on ship <b>and</b> <b>hurried</b> <b>to</b> the site of the problem. Such an emergency could include the submersible becoming tangled in fishing nets or entrapped in rocks or debris on the ocean floor. In such cases, the second heads to the rescue. There are also research experiments where it is advantageous to use the two vessels together.|$|E
25|$|After {{reforming}} in a pine thicket, the 19th blazed {{away at the}} Federals {{to their}} front. Lieutenant Wood and other officers picked up rifles and fought alongside the privates {{in an attempt to}} put as much firepower into the fight as they could muster. During this fight, Wood was wounded in the neck by a ball <b>and</b> <b>hurried</b> <b>to</b> the rear, where the wound was diagnosed as minor and dressed. Wood was soon sent back into the fight, although the scar from the wound remained visible {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
25|$|The victorious {{troops of}} the Three Leagues pillaged the Vinschgau valley for three days, burning every house and killing all men over twelve years of age. With their bounty, which {{included}} some 300 small and eight larger cannons, they retreated over the Fuorn Pass on May 25, 1499. When Maximilian, who {{was at that time}} at Landeck, heard of the defeat, he was enraged <b>and</b> <b>hurried</b> <b>to</b> Glurns, where he arrived on May 29, 1499. 38 hostages from the Engadin were killed in retaliation at Meran, and in June 1499 his troops ravaged the Engadin valley, burning most of the villages up to Samedan. When the Swiss Confederacy sent reinforcements on June 18, 1499 and troops from Berne, Zürich, Uri, and Glarus arrived at Davos, the Habsburg troops cleared the valley.|$|E

25|$|Just {{before the}} police arrived, the gang decided {{to prepare for}} action and let their prisoners go, but Mrs Jones told them to stay to hear Ned lecture.

Constable Bracken grabbed {{the key to the}} room in which he and others were held, told everyone to lie low if there was any firing, and escaped. He rushed to the railway station at which the train had just arrived and explained the situation to the police. Supt. Hare told his men to leave their horses and he was followed to the hotel by six constables and five Aboriginal trackers. At this point the police started the volley.|$|E
25|$|After {{learning}} of Michael's victory, Bocskai hired Hajdús (irregular soldiers, famed for their cruelty) <b>and</b> <b>hurried</b> <b>to</b> Kolozsvár. He thought that Michael {{was willing to}} withdraw from Transylvania and urged Giorgio Basta, the commander of Rudolph's army, to send new commissioners to Transylvania {{to put an end}} to the anarchy. Michael took possession of Transylvania proper, and the Diet acknowledged him as Rudolph's representative. Exposed to plundering raids by German, Wallachian, and Székely troops, Transylvania plunged into anarchy. Bocskai returned to the Partium, but Rudolph ordered him to join Michael in Gyulafehérvár on 26November. Michael tried to take advantage of Bocskai's presence to persuade the garrisons of the fortresses to swear fealty to him, but Bocskai did not want to be Michael's underling. After he realized that Michael did not want to restore his Transylvanian estates to him, he again left Transylvania proper and settled in Szentjobb in early 1600.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of September 5, 1877, Crazy Horse and Lieutenant Lee, {{accompanied}} by Touch the Clouds {{as well as a}} number of Indian scouts, departed for Fort Robinson. Arriving that evening outside the adjutant's office, Lieutenant Lee was informed that he was to turn Crazy Horse over to the Officer of the Day. Lee protested <b>and</b> <b>hurried</b> <b>to</b> Bradley's quarters to debate the issue, but without success. Bradley had received orders that Crazy Horse was to be arrested and taken under the cover of darkness to Division Headquarters. Lee turned the Oglala war chief over to Captain James Kennington, in charge of the post guard, who accompanied Crazy Horse to the post guardhouse. Once inside, Crazy Horse struggled with the guard and Little Big Man and attempted to escape. Just outside the door, Crazy Horse was stabbed with a bayonet by one of the members of the guard. He was taken to the adjutant's office, where he was tended by the assistant post surgeon at the post, Dr. Valentine McGillycuddy, and died late that night.|$|E

2500|$|... "It is {{hard that}} {{citizens}} enjoying a good name, {{who had the}} misfortune to come into business relations with the Government, should be exposed to such a spirit; {{that they should be}} dragged from their homes, <b>and</b> <b>hurried</b> <b>to</b> a military prison; that, though civilians, they should be treated as military offenders; that they should be compelled to undergo a protracted trial by courtmartial, damaging their good name, destroying their peace, breaking up their business, and subjecting them to untold expense,—when, at the slightest touch, the whole case vanishes into thin air, leaving behind nothing but the incomprehensible spirit in which it had its origin.|$|E
2500|$|In 1861, at the {{beginning}} of American Civil War, she procured the advance sheets, in French, of Agénor de Gasparin's [...] "Uprising of a Great People," [...] <b>and</b> <b>hurried</b> <b>to</b> Scribner's with it to ask if they would publish it if she would translate it. She was told that it would be valuable if it could be issued immediately, but that the war would not last more than a month, and then it would not be so interesting. Booth took the book home with her. By working 20 hours a day, she translated the whole book in less than a week, and it was published in a fortnight. The book created a great sensation among Northerners, and both Charles Sumner and President Lincoln wrote her letters of thanks. But though Sumner wrote her that what she had done was [...] "worth a whole phalanx in the cause of human freedom," [...] again she received but little pecuniary compensation. While the war lasted, however, she translated many French books calculated to rouse patriotic feeling, and was, at one time, summoned to Washington to write for the men whose work for their country she considered it a privilege to help, receiving only her board at a hotel. She was able at this time to procure for her father the position of clerk in the New York Custom House, and so relieve him from the very wearing night work he had been doing.|$|E
