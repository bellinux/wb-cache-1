500|$|In 1967 {{during a}} meeting with Alejo Carpentier, Julio Cortázar, and Miguel Otero Silva, the Mexican author Carlos Fuentes {{launched}} a project consisting {{of a series of}} biographies depicting Latin American dictators, which was to be called Los Padres de la Patria (The Fathers of the Fatherland). After reading Edmund Wilson's portraits of the American Civil War in Patriotic Gore, Fuentes recounts, [...] "Sitting in a pub in Hampstead, {{we thought it would be}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a comparable book on Latin America. An imaginary portrait gallery immediately stepped forward, demanding incarnation: the Latin American dictators." [...] Vargas Llosa was to write about Manuel A. Odría, Jorge Edwards about José Manuel Balmaceda, José Donoso about Mariano Melgarejo, and Julio Cortázar about Eva Perón. As M. Mar Langa Pizarro observes, the project was never completed, but it helped inspire a series of novels written by important authors during the Latin American literary boom, such as Alejo Carpentier, Augusto Roa Bastos, Gabriel García Márquez, and Mario Vargas Llosa.|$|E
500|$|Jenna's storyline in {{the episode}} {{received}} mixed reception. Canning enjoyed her subplot but found it predictable and stereotypical, while Sepinwall reported {{it did not}} work, and wrote that Jenna's stories need to have Liz or Jack featured prominently or that she be put with Scott Adsit's 30 Rock character, Pete Hornberger, as in this episode, [...] "as her insanity's only amusing when contrasted against a relatively normal character. As with Sepinwall, Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad believed Jenna's subplot was fair, observing it was great in parts but [...] "it just went on too long and got tedious and silly." [...] He believed it would be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Jenna dating or perhaps marrying a recurring character, but opined [...] "The Ones" [...] did not choose that path. Tom O'Neil from the Los Angeles Times, in an August 2009 article, was thrilled for Krakowski receiving an Emmy nomination for her work on 30 Rock, but felt that [...] "The Ones" [...] {{would not be the}} episode for which she'd win the Outstanding Supporting Actress award.|$|E
500|$|Considered {{rare for}} Disney animals, Pascal and Maximus do not speak. The idea to make Pascal and Maximus mute was {{inspired}} by the performances of actors Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton in Silent films. Identifying themselves as [...] "huge fans" [...] of Chaplin, Greno and Howard suggested that it would be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a character like the actor featured in the film. Additionally, the directors explained in an interview with Orange that Pascal and Maximus' silence was also inspired by the roles of Princess Aurora's animal friends in Disney's Sleeping Beauty (1959), following the film's rules and guidelines that even though they do not talk, they remain [...] "very expressive" [...] nonetheless and [...] "act and understand without words." [...] Maximus particularly [...] "belongs to the grand tradition of Disney creatures that are full of personality even though they don't talk." [...] One film critic observed that Pascal and Maximus [...] "have personalities all their own, making use of techniques harkening back to the silent era". Howard explained that [...] "Pantomime acting is a great challenge for our animators" [...] because, according to animator Jin Kim, Pascal and Maximus both [...] "had to be funny without speech", forcing the animators to exaggerate their emotions and facial expressions. The Chicago Sun-Times observed that [...] "Pascal ... doesn't speak, but manages to convey himself with eye rolls and changes of color." [...] Both animals' sound effects are provided by American actor Frank Welker.|$|E

500|$|Since 1978, Gabriel had {{composed}} all of {{his music}} at Ashcombe House, including his fourth studio album Peter Gabriel or [...] "Security" [...] (1982) and the Birdy (1984) soundtrack. An inexpensive studio existed in the house's adjacent barn, consisting of two rooms, one where Gabriel would produce his vocals and work on lyrics, and another where the music would be assembled. When preparing for So, Gabriel considered Chic's Nile Rodgers and Bill Laswell as potential producers. He eventually asked his Birdy collaborator, Daniel Lanois, to stay at Ashcombe and work with him further. Rehearsals began in May 1985 and consisted of Gabriel, Lanois and guitarist David Rhodes. Gabriel had begun work on some songs and provided Lanois and Rhodes with chord structures, around which they built their own improvised compositions. Lanois recalled they had [...] "a nice starting point [...] {{in that kind of}} scenario, it's not <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{a lot of people around}} because you get nervous that you're wasting other people's time". Consequently, there was a relaxed atmosphere surrounding these sessions and the trio would jokingly refer to themselves as The Three Stooges, an American vaudeville act of the mid-twentieth century. This also involved the wearing of construction site hard hats as they had a [...] "turning up for work humour". As sessions grew, engineer Kevin Killen, bassist Tony Levin, and drummer Jerry Marotta became significant contributors, and were aided by percussionists Manu Katché and Stewart Copeland and violinist L. Shankar.|$|E
2500|$|Marr and {{his wife}} Angie have been {{together}} since 1979, before the Smiths formed. They have two children, Sonny and Nile Marr; Nile is also a musician, {{best known as the}} frontman of the band Man Made. Having resided in Portland, Oregon, for more than five years, the family returned to Britain for Marr to record his solo album in Manchester. Marr initially gave up meat around 1985 in solidarity with Morrissey and Angie. He stated: [...] "It's not <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a number one album called Meat Is Murder and be seen eating a bacon sarnie." [...] After hanging out with American rap group Naughty By Nature, he was inspired by their philosophy of strength through health, and soon after quit drinking, smoking and converted to veganism. Marr is a keen runner, and completed the 2010 New York Marathon in a time of 3:54:18. He is a supporter of Manchester City football club and has been seen attending games.|$|E
