Although lacking any formal education in economics, Keating {{went on to}} become arguably one of the most reforming Treasurers in Australian history. During his time as Treasurer, the Australian dollar was floated, the financial sector deregulated, certain state sector industries were privatised, <b>a</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> was introduced, and a Prices and Incomes Accord was struck. In 1990 he was elected Deputy Leader of the Labor Party and made Deputy Prime Minister.|$|E

500|$|Labour Party {{president}} Moira Coatsworth {{stated that}} the leadership contest would be a [...] "robust contest of ideas", and suggested to the party's caucus that {{a series of meetings}} with party members be held around New Zealand. These were held from 6 to 11 December in six major cities—Hamilton, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin and Auckland. The party membership was then encouraged to give feedback to the party caucus, who would vote in the election. On 30 November Cunliffe, Parker and Shearer were interviewed by Mark Sainsbury on the current affairs programme Close Up. The television show held a text message poll in which viewers voted for their preferred leader of the party. Over 7,500 people took part; Shearer received 50% of the support, Cunliffe 31% and Parker 19%. The following day, Parker pulled out of the leadership race and put his support behind Shearer. Shearer and Cunliffe were interviewed by Guyon Espiner on political talkshow Q+A on 4 December. During the interview, both candidates indicated their support for the introduction of <b>a</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax,</b> which was a key part of Labour's tax policy during the 2011 general election campaign. Both also disagreed with the 2008 Employment Relations Amendment Act (90-day workplace trial), and wanted New Zealand to invest further in research and development; Shearer mentioned striving for a more green economy. On 9 December, Horizon Research released a demographically-weighted survey which found that 35.4% of adult New Zealanders supported Shearer's bid for the leadership, and 19.9% backed Cunliffe.|$|E
500|$|True Finns {{have said}} that Finland should not financially support the European Financial Stability Facility that led to bailouts for Ireland and Greece. Timo Soini asked: [...] "How come they (the European Union) can't see the euro doesn't work?" [...] The party {{manifesto}} {{said that they would}} support <b>a</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> increase from 28% to 30% and an increased tax on alcohol. The party also opposed mention of Finland's EU membership in the constitution and want to cut social welfare for immigrants. Soini also suggested Finland should unilaterally withdraw from the European Union Emission Trading Scheme and some other international commitments and that giving up the euro was an option. While speculating about a possible ministerial portfolio he later backed down on commitments when journalists asked him if the issues would be True Finns' demands in any possible government formation talks, citing the proposals as his personal opinion and not necessarily incorporated into a prospective government policy programme. He continued to maintain that the EU membership issue in the constitution would be a threshold for their participation in government formation talks. Helsingin Sanomat suggested that these demands could prove detrimental to a chance for True Finns to join a governing coalition. The True Finns also support the continuation of social welfare benefits. The party's support for the benefits along with its stance on the EU bailouts was also seen as one reason for its growth in popularity {{at a time when the}} country was facing welfare cuts by the government. The True Finns' vice-chairman Vesa-Matti Saarakkala said that [...] "the True Finns will not participate in a coalition government with any party ready to give further loan guarantees". This stance on the EU's bailout was read by The Wall Street Journal as detrimental to the euro zone's attempt to reassure bond investors that it would not face debt problems. It also said that a good showing for the True Finns could threaten Portugal's EU-sponsored bailout.|$|E
2500|$|Among other reforms, the Hawke Government {{dismantled}} the tariff system, privatised {{state sector}} industries, ended the subsidisation of loss-making industries, and sold off the state-owned Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Optus, Qantas and CSL Limited. The tax system was reformed, {{with the introduction}} of a fringe benefits tax and <b>a</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax,</b> reforms strongly opposed by the Liberal Party at the time, but not ones that they reversed when they eventually returned to office. Partially offsetting these imposts upon the business community – the [...] "main loser" [...] from the 1985 Tax Summit according to Paul Kelly – was the introduction of full dividend imputation, a reform insisted upon by Keating. Funding for schools was also considerably increased, while financial assistance was provided for students to enable them to stay at school longer. Considerable progress was also made in directing assistance [...] "to the most disadvantaged recipients over the whole range of welfare benefits." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1985, Keating argued {{within the}} Cabinet for the {{introduction}} of a broad-based consumption tax, similar in nature to the goods and services tax that was later introduced by the Howard government. In the build-up to the 1984 election, Hawke had promised a policy paper on taxation reform to be discussed with all stakeholders at a tax summit. Three options– A, B and C– were presented in the Draft White Paper, with Keating and his Treasury colleagues fiercely advocating for C, which included a consumption tax of 15% on goods and services along with reductions in personal and company income tax, a fringe benefits tax and <b>a</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax.</b> Although Keating was able to win the support of a reluctant Cabinet, Hawke believed that the opposition from the public, the ACTU, and the business community would be too great. He therefore decided to abandon any plans for a consumption tax, although the remainder of the reforms were adopted in the tax reform package. The loss of the consumption tax was seen a bitter defeat for Keating; he later joked about it at a press conference, saying, [...] "It's a bit like Ben Hur. We've crossed the line with one wheel off, but we have crossed the line." ...|$|E

50|$|An {{investor}} buys a {{strip mall}} (a commercial property) for $200,000 (his cost basis). After six years, he could sell the property for $250,000.
