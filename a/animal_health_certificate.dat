40|$|AbstractAirline travel favours the {{transmission}} of diseases, given the short {{time it takes to}} travel long distances. In this study, <b>animal</b> products without <b>health</b> <b>certificates</b> seized in international air passengers’ baggage at Guarulhos (GRU) and Galeão (GIG) airports in Brazil underwent a microbiological evaluation. Analyses (1610) were carried out on 322 seizures to test for the presence of total and thermotolerant coliforms, as well as Staphylococcus aureus counts and the presence of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella. Most seizures analysed showed coliform contamination and coliforms were present above acceptable limits in 83. 4 % (40 / 48) of the products that had some type of contamination. The second most prevalent microorganism found was L. monocytogenes in 22. 9 % (11 / 48) and S. aureus was cultivated in 14. 58 % (7 / 48) of seizures. Among the items seized in the present work, Salmonella was found in one seizure of pig sausage. Contamination of animal products with microbiological pathogens of importance to public health and indicators of the bad quality of the food were shown in the present study...|$|R
30|$|Airports are {{the most}} {{important}} country frontiers to be protected because infectious agents can reach destinations and disseminate very quickly and they are strategic areas for national veterinary surveillance. This is because infectious agents can be transported in food of animal origin, especially those without <b>health</b> <b>certificates</b> and these can be detected in international baggage (Taniguchi et al. 2008 Chaber et al. 2010) using X-ray scanners. Airborne, food-borne, vector-borne, and zoonotic infectious diseases transmitted during commercial air travel became an important public health issue due to the greater affordability of air travel, increasing the mobility of people (Mangili and Gendreau 2005). To minimize the risk of these diseases entering a country, products of animal origin need to be accompanied by an international <b>health</b> <b>certificate.</b> This is crucial to assure a reliable health situation when countries with known health status are involved, as regulated by the World Organisation for <b>Animal</b> <b>Health</b> (OIE) for its member countries (Pastoret and Chaisemartin 2011).|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to map the distribution of pork retail outlets as well as assess their role in food borne disease transmission. Using a structured questionnaire, practices associated with hygiene related to infrastructure, workers, and equipment were assessed. Sources of pork were assessed to determine whether pork had undergone inspection, as were socio economic determinants of hygiene outcomes and risk factors for foodborne disease. There were 158 pork outlets in the five divisions of Kampala. Overall, 68 % of the pork was from places where slaughtering was not authorized (ungazetted) and meat inspection not carried out. Worker hygiene score was highest (average 71 %), followed by infrastructure (68. 2 %) and equipment (47. 3 %).

30|$|Training in {{livestock}} health {{provision was}} reported by respondents (58.8  %) as a strategy to reduce risks associated with recurrent drought and livestock diseases. The increased number of trained, community-based <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> workers now operating in Turkana areas is an important <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> delivery channel in this marginal area (Mugunieri et al. 2004). Of the livestock keepers who had treated their animals, 85  % claimed to have gained skills, training, and knowledge from the community-based <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> workers. Traditionally the control of livestock diseases was {{through the use of}} local herbs and local techniques; these practices seem to have changed with the emergence of trained community-based <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> workers. Key informants revealed that many youth with <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> care skills are able to support their families with income earned from the sale of veterinary drugs and from attending to sick animals. But owing to the limited training and literacy of community-based <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> workers, these medical providers have been perceived by professional veterinarians and government officials {{as a threat to the}} provision of adequate <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> services (Mugunieri et al. 2004).|$|R
40|$|The {{quantity}} of research information being made {{available on the}} World Wide Web in various disciplines is increasing tremendously. This study examined the coverage of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information published on the web from Africa or about Africa. Challenges and opportunities of publishing and disseminating <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information online in Africa were also examined. Websites and online databases which offer agricultural information {{were included in the}} analysis, but the main focus was on research, education and extension information in the core areas of <b>animal</b> <b>health.</b> Content analysis method was used to determine what agricultural academic indexing and abstracting databases have in terms of quality researched <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information published from Africa or about Africa. Well-known databases, such as AGRICOLA, AGRIS, CAB Direct, PUBMED and Cochrane Library were investigated. The criteria used to determine the African <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information included the content of research <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information available on the website, {{how easy it is to}} locate information once the site has been located, the usefulness of the information, and how current and up-to-date the information is. It was found that the representation of African <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information on the web is generally low. The poor coverage of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information on the web emanates from many factors: poor ICT (Information Communications Technology) infrastructure in many African countries, lack of ICT literacy, awareness and mindset, lack of recognition of all the values of information services, poor state of African indexing and abstracting services, inadequate funds, and perceived misconceptions of actual causes of the problem. Thus, this situation has led to the web being dominated by the <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information from developed countries. Despite the challenges faced by African researchers in publishing their research findings on the web, most <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> scholars collaborate well with some international organizations in disseminating <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information on the web.

5000|$|However, {{since this}} {{did little to}} reduce prostitution, Austrian laws changed to {{consider}} prostitution as a necessary evil {{that had to be}} tolerated but regulated by the state. In 1850, Dr. Nusser of the Vienna police suggested that prostitutes be required to register with the police, receive medical examinations twice a week, and obtain special <b>health</b> <b>certificates.</b> In 1873, Anton Ritter von Le Monnier, head of the Vienna police, reformed Vienna's prostitution law, and <b>health</b> <b>certificates</b> have been obligatory since that time. Prostitutes who complied with the requirements of registration and examinations were no longer prosecuted by the police. A newspaper article of October 27, 1874 reported that 6,424 prostitutes had received <b>health</b> <b>certificates</b> and were under observation by police and health authorities. According to police estimates, at least 12,000 more women lived on the proceeds of [...] "free love" [...] without being registered. Most of these were factory workers who received so little pay that they needed the additional income. Of the registered prostitutes, 5,312 were unmarried, 902 widows, and 210 married.

40|$|The {{way that}} an {{economist}} and an <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> professional use economics differs and creates frustrations. The economist is {{in search of}} optimizing resource allocation {{in the management of}} <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> and disease problems with metrics associated with the productivity of key societal resources of labour and capital. The <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> professional have a strong belief that productivity can be improved with the removal of pathogens. These differences restrict how well economics is used in <b>animal</b> <b>health,</b> and the question posed is whether this matters. The paper explores the question by looking at the changing role of animals in society and the associated change of the <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> professional's activities. It then questions if the current allocation of scarce resources for <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> are adequately allocated for societies and whether currently available data are sufficient for good allocation. A rapid review of the data on disease impacts - production losses and costs of human reaction - indicate that the data are sparse collected in different times and geographical regions. This limits what can be understood on the productivity of the economic resources used for <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> and this needs to be addressed with more systematic collection of data on disease losses and costs of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> systems. Ideally such a process should learn lessons from the way that human health has made estimates of the burden of diseases and their capture of data on the costs of human health systems. Once available data on the global burden of animal diseases and the costs of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> systems would allow assessments of individual disease management processes and the productivity of wider productivity change.
