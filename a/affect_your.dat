5|$|That's how I {{wanted to}} open the video, because I think it really sets {{up the rest of}} the story. It allows you to imagine you {{yourself}} are not just one person; you're so many. That person has so many stories and memories to draw from, and they all <b>affect</b> <b>your</b> journey profusely. I'm battered quite brutally at the beginning of the video, but at the end, I'm not battered; I'm a bit strange. It's not meant to be an answer video; it's meant to be a profuse number of the question.|$|E

On {{the local level}} it takes eight career wins to {{transfer}} from Novice to Intermediate; from Intermediate to Expert 25 career wins are necessary.

[...] Zappa stated, [...] "Drugs do not become a problem until the person who uses the drugs does something to you, or does something that would <b>affect</b> <b>your</b> life that you don't want to have happen to you, like an airline pilot who crashes because he was full of drugs." [...] He was a regular tobacco smoker for most of his life, and strongly critical of anti-tobacco campaigns.|$|E

500|$|The Washington Post Stuever {{has many}} {{complaints}} about the show {{including the fact that}} it is about Washington, DC, but filmed in Baltimore. He also complains about its entrance into the television landscape littered with [...] "more fictitious administrations than anyone can keep track of". He says that perspective will <b>affect</b> <b>your</b> perception of the show. Those not already inundated with [...] "Type A personalities inside the Beltway" [...] in their daily lives may be drawn to the show. However, it is not likely a show that will serve well those who spend a lot of time with the issues that the show deals with. After viewing the first two episodes, Stuever also finds fault with the use of breaking the fourth wall, describing it as [...] "the show's unwise narrative trope". The Wall Street Journal Smith defends the fourth wall as an [...] "artifice that generally works well here to loosen our bearings".|$|E
500|$|When {{the studio}} hired Kenneth Branagh and Joe Johnston to direct Thor and , respectively, it made sure both {{directors}} {{were open to}} the idea of a shared universe and including Avengers set-up scenes in their films. Joe Russo stated, [...] "That's the exciting component of [...] 'What can we set up for the future?' You're constantly pitching out ideas that not only <b>affect</b> <b>your</b> movie, but may have a ripple effect that affects other films ... It's a weird sort of tapestry of writers and directors working together to create this universe that's sort of organic." [...] Anthony added, [...] "The great thing about the Marvel , just like the publishing , it's a very vast, inter-connected universe, where characters will have their rise and fall, so to speak, and hand off to other characters. As the cinematic universe moves forward, you may start to see the cinematic universe adopt that same pattern, as the publishing has, where there's closure with some characters and new beginnings with other characters." [...] He added that, for directors to [...] "fit" [...] in at Marvel, they must understand how to [...] "take a larger story and wrangle it into a moment", yet keep it connected.|$|E
2500|$|Consuming {{large amounts}} of {{saturated}} fat can negatively <b>affect</b> <b>your</b> brain. [...] Eating foods with saturated fats elevates the level of cholesterol and triglycerides in your body. [...] Studies have shown that high levels of triglycerides strongly link with mood problems such as depression, hostility and aggression. [...] This may occur because high triglyceride levels decrease the amount of oxygen that blood can carry to your brain. The American Heart Association recommends that you consume no more than 16g of saturated fat daily. [...] Common sources of saturated fat are meat and dairy products.|$|E

A third book on Christian moral action, [...] "Living on Our Heads: Righting an Upside-Down Culture," [...] was released in August 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Whenever Shi Yi {{recommended}} {{talents to}} Sun Quan, he only pointed out {{their strengths and}} said nothing about their weaknesses. Sun Quan thus chided him for not saying anything about their weaknesses and not making judgments about them. In response, Shi Yi said, [...] "Your Majesty, as your subject, my duty is to perform my role well. I am always worried about not being competent in my role. (I keep my opinions about their weaknesses to myself because) I don't want to let my ignorance and limited knowledge <b>affect</b> <b>Your</b> Majesty's judgment about them." ...|$|E

Now you must raise your children up in a world where that union of man and box turtle is on the same legal footing as man and wife".

2500|$|PvP is also {{accessible}} {{through the}} Arena in the player's capital city. While identical to Sparta PvP in many ways, Arena PvP can differ in many ways.

Arena PvP [...] will not <b>affect</b> <b>your</b> Sparta PvP Trueskill ranking. Finally, arena PvP also does not provide any rewards to the winning player. The August 2012 update also added a new spectator mode option for Arena PvP and the October 2012 update made Arena PvP (Standard or Champion mode) free for all players.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking of the [...] "ripple effect," [...] Rouse {{explains}} that, to {{a certain}} extent, it was dictated {{by a sense of}} narrative logic; [...] "it's really crucial that Carmen treats you differently depending on whether you killed her or not. It doesn't make sense that she'd still be loving toward you if you killed her in cold blood." [...] However, it was also important that the player never feel locked into one morality; they could begin the game with bad morality and finish with good morality; [...] "you can travel down different moral paths, and both the beginning you started with and the choices you make during Ties that Bind will <b>affect</b> <b>your</b> final outcome. So there are really a surprising number of possible stories to be told. I want every player to have their own unique version of Torque's story. I hope no two players will remember the game and the story exactly the same." ...|$|E

She also discussed one of the album's [...] "primary themes" [...] – [...] "what it's like to be in love" [...] – explaining [...] " [...] mistakes you make when you're in love and how they <b>affect</b> <b>your</b> life" [...] after saying [...] "I was able to experience some things this year and I wrote about them." [...] In describing the album during another interview, this time for GospelCity, Williams said [...] "these songs are just about the real me" [...] and that she [...] "just wrote from [...] heart" [...] before acknowledging that [...] "it didn't turn out to be as 'gospel-ly' as some would have liked", but [...] "the stuff" [...] that's on the album [...] "is stuff [...] went through". Williams then said [...] "this whole album is about God's love and me". After being asked [...] "Michelle, as people listen to the album, Do You Know, as they get acquainted with the songs, what are you hoping to bring to their lives?", Williams responded [...] "That everybody live in peace and not settle for anything less than what the Lord wants to bring your way. I know what I went through, I know God is taking me to another level. I had people around me that were not going where I was going – I had to release them from my life." ...|$|E
