5|$|In {{computer}} science, {{simulations of}} evolution using evolutionary algorithms and artificial life {{started in the}} 1960s and were extended with simulation of artificial selection. <b>Artificial</b> <b>evolution</b> became a widely recognised optimisation method {{as a result of}} the work of Ingo Rechenberg in the 1960s. He used evolution strategies to solve complex engineering problems. Genetic algorithms in particular became popular through the writing of John Henry Holland. Practical applications also include automatic evolution of computer programmes. Evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi-dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers and also to optimise the design of systems.|$|E

40|$|SummarySmall cystine-stabilized {{proteins}} are desirable scaffolds for therapeutics and diagnostics. Specific folding and binding {{properties of}} the proteinaceous binders can be engineered with combinatorial protein libraries in connection with <b>artificial</b> molecular <b>evolution.</b> The combinatorial protein libraries are composed of scaffold variants with random sequence variation, which inevitably produces {{a portion of the}} library sequences incompatible with the parent structure. Here, we used <b>artificial</b> molecular <b>evolution</b> to elucidate structure-determining residues in a smallest cystine-stabilized scaffold. The structural determinant information was then applied to designing cystine-stabilized miniproteins binding to human vascular endothelial growth factor. This work demonstrated a general methodology on engineering artificial cystine-stabilized proteins as antibody mimetics with simultaneously enhanced folding and binding properties...|$|R

2500|$|Evolutionary {{robotics}} is {{done with}} many different objectives, often at the same time. These include creating useful controllers for real-world robot tasks, exploring the intricacies of evolutionary theory (such as the Baldwin effect), reproducing psychological phenomena, and finding out about biological neural networks by studying artificial ones. Creating controllers via <b>artificial</b> <b>evolution</b> requires {{a large number of}} evaluations of a large population. This is very time consuming, {{which is one of the}} reasons why controller evolution is usually done in software. Also, initial random controllers may exhibit potentially harmful behaviour, such as repeatedly crashing into a wall, which may damage the robot. Transferring controllers evolved in simulation to physical robots is very difficult and a major challenge in using the ER approach. The reason is that evolution is free to explore all possibilities to obtain a high fitness, including any inaccuracies of the simulation [...] This need for a large number of evaluations, requiring fast yet accurate computer simulations, is one of the limiting factors of the ER approach [...]|$|E

40|$|A {{simulation}} model {{is used to}} construct a regime of <b>artificial</b> economic <b>evolution,</b> where Schumpeterian process competition prevails, {{in the presence of}} technological uncertainty and bounded rationality. The output decision of the firm is represented by a behavioural algorithm, which allows for the presence of collusive behaviour. The purpose of the experiments is to go some way towards addressing the twin issues {{of the nature of the}} relationship between market structure and industry performance in a dynamic setting, and the contention that the evolutionary metaphor implies a laissez-faire stance with respect to policy issues. Under the simplifying assumptions of the model, experiments suggest that industries which generate high average concentration over a given period can compare favourably with industries that generate low average concentration, if the time profiles of both welfare and concentration are analysed. Also, the experiments suggest that the industry will naturally evolve a structure best suited to exploit the technological environment, but despite this there is still a role for intervention into the competitive process. <b>Artificial</b> economic <b>evolution,</b> Schumpeterian competition, Bounded rationality, Collusion, Laissez-faire...|$|R

40|$|Artificial neural {{networks}} and other connectionist models of computation are frequently credited with biological plausibility. Since biological systems {{are products of}} Darwinian evolution, network optimisation by <b>artificial</b> <b>evolutions</b> has considerable appeal. However, the computational expense of this can become prohibitive unless an {{emphasis is placed on}} modularity and reuse. Gene expression holds the answer to this. Genes are translated into proteins that self-organize into phenotypic traits such as the brain, with feedback loops controlling the further expression of genes. In this paper we present a generalization of this mechanism, a context-free graph grammar that describes a graph of finite-state automata. The graph is generated by replacing hyperedges with subgraphs of automata and other hyperedges according to a set of hypergraph productions. These automata need not be homogeneous, e. g. they may correspond to different types of neurons, reflecting the diversity of neurons in the brain. Desirable hypergraph productions are retrieved from a population of productions, which evolve by mutation of existing productions and subsequent selection against a user-defined criterion...|$|R
