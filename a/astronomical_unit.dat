5|$|A {{number of}} {{scientific}} organizations {{headed by the}} European Southern Observatory (ESO) organized a network of amateur astronomers and students to measure Earth's distance from the Sun during the transit. The participants' observations allowed a calculation of the <b>astronomical</b> <b>unit</b> (AU) of 149,608,708km ± 11,835km which had only a 0.007% difference to the accepted value.|$|E
5|$|In 1771, {{using the}} {{combined}} 1761 and 1769 transit data, the French astronomer Jérôme Lalande calculated the <b>astronomical</b> <b>unit</b> {{to have a}} value of 153 million kilometers (±1 million km). The precision was less than had been hoped for because of the black drop effect, but still a considerable improvement on Horrocks's calculations.|$|E
5|$|Large lengths, such as {{the radius}} of a giant star or the semi-major axis of a binary star system, are often {{expressed}} in terms of the <b>astronomical</b> <b>unit</b> — approximately equal to the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun (150 million km or approximately 93 million miles). In 2012, the IAU defined the astronomical constant to be an exact length in meters: 149,597,870,700 m.|$|E

This list includes various units of measure used in atomic and nuclear physics and in astronomy {{such as the}} dalton, the electron mass, the electron volt, the <b>astronomical</b> <b>unit,</b> the solar mass, {{and a number of}} other units of measure that are well-established, but dependent on experimentally-determined physical quantities.|$|E
5|$|However, {{they are}} not thought to be {{favorable}} locations {{for the survival of}} planetary systems. Planetary orbits are dynamically unstable within the cores of dense clusters because of the perturbations of passing stars. A planet orbiting at 1 <b>astronomical</b> <b>unit</b> around a star that is within the core of a dense cluster such as 47 Tucanae would only survive on the order of 108 years. There is a planetary system orbiting a pulsar (PSR B1620−26) that belongs to the globular cluster M4, but these planets likely formed after the event that created the pulsar.|$|E
5|$|The {{volume of}} interplanetary space is a nearly total vacuum, {{with a mean}} free path of about one <b>astronomical</b> <b>unit</b> at the orbital {{distance}} of the Earth. However, this space is not completely empty, and is sparsely filled with cosmic rays, which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles. There is also gas, plasma and dust, small meteors, and several dozen types of organic molecules discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy. A cloud of interplanetary dust is visible at night as a faint band called the zodiacal light.|$|E
5000|$|An {{infrared}} excess {{indicative of}} a debris disk was first discovered by IRAS. Further observations of the system have been made using Keck and the Spitzer Space Telescope.

50|$|The star {{also shows}} signs of intense water emissions, {{indicative}} {{of the presence of}} a wide disk of dust and water vapour. Such emissions cover a zone spanning between 10.7 <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Units</b> (within Saturn's orbital zone) and 1.2 parsecs (or nearly 247,500 <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Units,</b> as far away as the Oort Cloud in Solar System).|$|R
5|$|A {{search of}} this star by the Hubble Space Telescope {{revealed}} no stellar companions, although {{this does not}} preclude the presence of smaller companions that are below the telescope's detection limit, such as a planet orbiting within one <b>astronomical</b> <b>unit</b> of the star. No excess infrared emission has been detected, which may indicate {{the lack of a}} debris disk in orbit around it. Radial velocity measurements of this star using the Near Infrared Spectrometer (NIRSPEC) instrument at the Keck II observatory have not revealed any variations that might otherwise indicate the presence of an orbiting companion. This instrumentation is sensitive enough to detect the gravitational perturbations massive, short period companions with the mass of Neptune or greater.|$|E
5|$|A spherical shell Dyson sphere in the Solar System with a {{radius of}} one <b>astronomical</b> <b>unit,</b> {{so that the}} {{interior}} surface would receive {{the same amount of}} sunlight as Earth does per unit solid angle, would have a surface area of approximately , or about 550 million times the surface area of Earth. This would intercept the full 384.6 yottawatts (3.846 × 1026 watts) of the Sun's output. Non-shell designs would intercept less, but the shell variant represents the maximum possible energy captured for the Solar System at this point of the Sun's evolution. This is approximately 33 trillion times the power consumption of humanity in 1998, which was 12 terawatts.|$|E

The oldest film known is the 1874 Passage de Venus, showing the 1874 Venus transit of the sun. Historically, transits of Venus were important, because they allowed astronomers to determine {{the size of the}} <b>astronomical</b> <b>unit,</b> and hence the size of the Solar System as shown by Horrocks in 1639. Captain Cook's exploration of the east coast of Australia came after he had sailed to Tahiti in 1768 to observe a transit of Venus.|$|E

5|$|Transit {{observations}} in 1874 and 1882 allowed this value to be refined further. Three expeditions—from Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States—were {{sent to the}} Kerguelen Archipelago for the 1874 observations. The American astronomer Simon Newcomb combined {{the data from the}} last four transits, and he arrived at a value of about 149.59 million kilometers (±0.31 million kilometers). Modern techniques, {{such as the use of}} radio telemetry from space probes, and of radar measurements of the distances to planets and asteroids in the Solar System, have allowed a reasonably accurate value for the <b>astronomical</b> <b>unit</b> (AU) to be calculated to a precision of about ±30 meters. As a result, the need for parallax calculations has been superseded.|$|E
5|$|A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing {{close to}} the Sun, warms and begins to release gases, a process called outgassing. This {{produces}} a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due {{to the effects of}} solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one <b>astronomical</b> <b>unit.</b> If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.|$|E
5|$|Spherical coordinates, {{known as}} {{ecliptic}} longitude and latitude or celestial longitude and latitude, {{are used to}} specify positions of bodies on the celestial sphere {{with respect to the}} ecliptic. Longitude is measured positively eastward 0° to 360° along the ecliptic from the vernal equinox, the same direction in which the Sun appears to move. Latitude is measured perpendicular to the ecliptic, to +90° northward or -90° southward to the poles of the ecliptic, the ecliptic itself being 0° latitude. For a complete spherical position, a distance parameter is also necessary. Different distance units are used for different objects. Within the Solar System, astronomical units are used, and for objects near Earth, Earth radii or kilometers are used. A corresponding right-handed rectangular coordinate system is also used occasionally; the x-axis is directed toward the vernal equinox, the y-axis 90° to the east, and the z-axis toward the north ecliptic pole; the <b>astronomical</b> <b>unit</b> is the unit of measure. Symbols for ecliptic coordinates are somewhat standardized; see the table.|$|E

5|$|The first {{recorded}} observation of a transit of Venus {{was made by}} Jeremiah Horrocks from his home at Carr House in Much Hoole, near Preston in England, on 4 December 1639 (24 November under the Julian calendar then in use in England). His friend, William Crabtree, also observed this transit from Broughton, near Manchester. Kepler had predicted transits in 1631 and 1761 and a near miss in 1639. Horrocks corrected Kepler's calculation for the orbit of Venus, realized that transits of Venus would occur in pairs 8 years apart, and so predicted the transit of 1639. Although he was uncertain of the exact time, he calculated that the transit was to begin at approximately 15:00. Horrocks focused {{the image of the}} Sun through a simple telescope onto a piece of paper, where the image could be safely observed. After observing for most of the day, he was lucky to see the transit as clouds obscuring the Sun cleared at about 15:15, just half an hour before sunset. Horrocks's observations allowed him to make a well-informed guess as to the size of Venus, as well as to make an estimate of the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun— the <b>astronomical</b> <b>unit.</b> He estimated that distance to be 59.4millionmiles (95.6Gm, 0.639AU)– about two thirds of the actual distance of 93millionmiles (149.6 million km), but a more accurate figure than any suggested up to that time. The observations were not published until 1661, well after Horrocks's death.|$|E

25|$|He {{attempted}} {{to measure the}} distance {{and size of the}} Sun. In about 90 BCE, Posidonius estimated the distance from the earth to the sun (see <b>astronomical</b> <b>unit)</b> to be 9,893 times the Earth's radius. This was still too small by half. In measuring the size of the Sun, however, he reached a figure larger and more accurate than those proposed by other Greek astronomers and Aristarchus of Samos.|$|E
