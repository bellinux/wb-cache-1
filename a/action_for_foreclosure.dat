30|$|There {{are some}} {{empirical}} analyses from the US discussing a possible discount <b>for</b> <b>foreclosure</b> auctions (e.g., Shilling et al. 1990; Carroll et al. 1997; Clauretie and Daneshvary 2009).

Nevertheless, there are certain similarities {{with regard to the}} content of these studies. Shilling et al. (1990) identify a significant discount of up to 24  %, and Carroll et al.

More recent studies, which are testing for more discriminating factors, assume that the differences are determined by the property’s characteristics instead of the type of workout-process. The discount <b>for</b> <b>foreclosure</b> auctions equals only 10  % in the study by Clauretie and Daneshvary (2009) and 3 – 7  % in the study by Campbell et al. (2011).|$|R

Using the judicial / non-judicial law as an instrument <b>for</b> <b>foreclosures,</b> we show that foreclosures lead to a large decline in house prices, residential investment, and consumer demand. ...|$|R
