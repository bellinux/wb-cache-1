25|$|In {{addition}} to the stressed-skin construction, Reggiane introduced several advanced features on the Re.2000, such as a modern structure, which was considerably more advanced than the ones used in Macchi's and other Italian fighters of the time, along with an elliptical wing profile. Overall, the design possessed greater aerodynamic sophistication in comparison to other Italian rivals rivals such as the Fiat G.50 and Macchi C.200. The Re.2000 was furnished with retractable landing gear; the main gear retracted via the Curtiss method, the wheels rotating around to face flat within the wheel wells when retracted. The atypical fairing covered the landing gear's <b>actuation</b> <b>mechanism,</b> while the legs incorporated hydraulic shock absorbers and drag struts to effective absorb loads; pneumatic brakes were also fitted.

The added advantage of a CMOS-compatible fabrication process allows our device to be monolithically integrated with CMOS integrated circuits. Optical deflection angles of ± 1. 5 ◦ for a 74 -Hz vertical scan at 12 mW by electrothermal actuation and ± 10 ◦ for a horizontal scan frequency of 202 Hz at 1. 26 mA and 1 Vac by EM actuation are reported.

40|$|In this paper, we {{illustrate}} {{and study}} the opportunities of resonant ring type structures as wing <b>actuation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for a flapping wing Micro Air Vehicle (MAV). Various design alternatives are presented and studied based on computational and physical models. Insects provide {{an excellent source of}} inspiration {{for the development of the}} wing <b>actuation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for flapping wing MAVs. The insect thorax is a structure which in essence provides a mechanism to couple the wing muscles to the wings while offering weight reduction through application of resonance, using tailored elasticity. The resonant properties of the thorax are a very effective way to reducing the power expenditure of wing movement. The wing movement itself is fairly complex and is guided by a set of control muscles and thoracic structures which are present in proximity of the wing root. The development of flapping wing MAVs requires a move away from classical structures and actuators. The use of gears and rotational electric motors is hard to justify at the small scale. Resonant structures provide a large design freedom whilst also providing various options for actuation. The move away from deterministic mechanisms offers possibilities for mass reduction.

50|$|The <b>actuation</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{is simply}} a piston and cylinder, similar to a small {{pneumatic}} ram. The tappet bore where a hydraulic tappet would normally reside, becomes the cylinder, and the retainer assembly becomes the piston. Pressurized air (nitrogen) is pumped into this cylinder which then causes the piston/retainer {{to rise to the}} top of cylinder, causing the valve to form an airtight seal with the seat. The compressed gas then becomes the spring, so to speak, but does not have the same traits as springs do at elevated rpm. A small light spring is sometimes fitted between the piston and retainer so that when the system is switched off the spring forces the piston down against the bottom of the bore, thus forcing the retainer upwards. This ensures that no crown-to-valve contact occurs when shut down.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the development of stacked ceramic thin actuation layer IDEAL (Inter-Digitated Electrode Actuation Layer) using d 33 <b>actuation</b> <b>mechanism</b> of piezoelectric ceramic. Most of the thin piezoelectric actuators are operated with d 31 <b>actuation</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Many kinds of piezoelectric ceramic actuators are strived now to improve the actuation performance. One of efforts to improve performance of piezoceramic actuators is the research trying to develop an actuator using the piezoelectric coefficient d 33. The piezoelectric coefficient d 33 is almost twice larger than piezoelectric coefficient d 31. Therefore, the induced strain of PZT thin layer with d 33 <b>actuation</b> <b>mechanism</b> is bigger than that with d 31 <b>actuation</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The AFC and LaRC-MFC used d 33 <b>actuation</b> <b>mechanism</b> with surface interdigitated electrode to enhance its actuation performance. But their <b>actuation</b> <b>mechanism</b> is not perfect d 33 <b>actuation</b> <b>mechanism</b> since the interdigitated electrodes are placed at the surface of the actuation layer. In this research, the stacked ceramic thin actuation layer with imbedded inter-digitated electrodes is designed and manufactured. The actuation strain of stacked ceramic thin actuation layer is measured and compared with the actuation strain of the LaRC-MFC. The comparison shows that the developed stacked ceramic thin actuation layer can produce 10 % more actuation strain than LaRC-MFC at relatively high electric field...|$|E

Therefore, the system resembles a nanoelectromechanical heat engine. We derive a criterion for the mechanical instability and estimate the amplitude of the resulting self-sustained oscillations.
