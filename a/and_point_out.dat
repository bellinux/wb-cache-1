He wrote a column for the Sporting Globe newspaper, spoke at sportsmans' nights and made regular television appearances, including on World of Sport, to comment on Australian rules football <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that there had not been a player of his ability in the VFL since {{his retirement}}.|$|E
5|$|However other scholars, such as Arthur Berriedale Keith, J. Burnet and A.R. Wadia, {{believe that}} the two systems {{developed}} independently. They note {{that there is no}} historical evidence of the philosophers of the two schools meeting, <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> significant differences in the stage of development, orientation and goals of the two philosophical systems. Wadia writes that Plato's metaphysics were rooted in this life and his primary aim was to develop an ideal state. In contrast, Upanishadic focus was the individual, the self (atman, soul), self-knowledge, and the means of an individual's moksha (freedom, liberation in this life or after-life).|$|E
5|$|Skeptics {{argue that}} {{conspiracy}} theorists grossly overestimate {{the influence of}} ex-Nazis and neo-Nazis on American society, <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that political repression at home and imperialism abroad {{have a long history}} in the United States that predates the 20th century. Some political scientists, such as Sheldon Wolin, have expressed concern that the twin forces of democratic deficit and superpower status have paved the way in the U.S. for the emergence of an inverted totalitarianism which contradicts many principles of Nazism.|$|E

5|$|Perot's {{performance}} {{satisfied the}} 5% popular vote threshold for third party candidates, classifying it as successful under the criterion established by scholar Walter Dean Burnham. The legitimacy of this {{success has been}} questioned by scholars who dismiss the label of Perot as a typical third party candidate, {{largely due to the}} availability of campaign funds and financing of grassroots efforts. Others dispute these claims <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that Perot forced the other candidates to change their rhetoric on the issues to gain the votes of his supporters, indicating an issues campaign. Exit polls revealed that 35% of voters would have voted for Perot if they believed he could win. Contemporary analysis reveals that Perot could have won the election if the polls prior to the election had shown the candidate with a larger share, preventing the wasted vote mindset.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{believe that}} much of the low {{northern}} plains of the planet were covered with an ocean hundreds of meters deep, though this remains controversial. In March 2015, scientists stated that such an ocean might have been the size of Earth's Arctic Ocean. This finding was derived from the ratio of water to deuterium in the modern Martian atmosphere compared to that ratio on Earth. The amount of Martian deuterium is eight times the amount that exists on Earth, suggesting that ancient Mars had significantly higher levels of water. Results from the Curiosity rover had previously found a high ratio of deuterium in Gale Crater, though not significantly high enough to suggest the former presence of an ocean. Other scientists caution that these results have not been confirmed, <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that Martian climate models have not yet shown that the planet was warm enough in the past to support bodies of liquid water.|$|E

Currently, the availability of media in the Valencian language is extremely limited. All the other autonomous communities in Spain, including the monolingual ones, have public-service broadcasters, with the Valencian Community being the only exception despite being the fourth most populated.|$|E

(Stevo's New and Improved Vandals). Escalante has stated that the older members relinquished control of the band's name and rights to him in {{exchange}} for permission to play the show, but the others deny this claim <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that Escalante served an injunction against them during the performance preventing them from further use of the name and music.|$|E
25|$|The next day, in {{a section}} that is known as The Naked Truth, the couple is {{together}} required to reveal themselves behind a silhouette screen, where they see each other nude, but with Woodall, Constantine and the audience at home only seeing a silhouette. The participants have to comment on <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> on a small camera {{what they think is}} best about their partner's body and figure and are prompted to confront their insecurities. Confronting issues and using Woodall and Constantine as confidantes, is aimed to help the couple release insecurities and burdens, and ultimately become more at ease with each other.|$|E
25|$|Mormon authors {{claim that}} the {{description}} of olive horticulture in Jacob 5 is too specific and detailed for Smith to have learned on his own in early 19th century New England, so they assert it is evidence that Smith's story of the Book of Mormon's divine origin is true. Critics assert that the narrative could have been completely based on the biblical texts in Isaiah 5 and Romans 11 <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that midway through Jacob 5 Smith switches from an allegory of a single olive tree to an allegory of a vineyard, reflecting his imperfect use of the biblical texts.|$|E

25|$|The most {{apparent}} type of interspecific aggression is that {{observed in the}} interaction between a predator and its prey. However, according to many researchers, predation is not aggression. A cat does not hiss or arch its back when pursuing a rat, and the active areas in its hypothalamus resemble those that reflect hunger rather than those that reflect aggression. However, others refer to this behavior as predatory aggression, <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> cases that resemble hostile behavior, such as mouse-killing by rats. In aggressive mimicry a predator has {{the appearance of a}} harmless organism or object attractive to the prey; when the prey approaches, the predator attacks.|$|E
25|$|On March 18, 2004, {{a gorilla}} named Jabari scaled a {{retaining}} wall and injured four visitors. He was fatally {{shot by a}} police SWAT team after being pursued by zoo employees through the Wilds of Africa exhibit. This incident prompted several zoos to create or enhance emergency response teams to deal with escaped animals. The Jake L. Hamon Gorilla Research Center was redesigned with new landscape, taller walls, and expanded viewing areas for visitors, including an air conditioned visitor center with floor-to-ceiling windows, videos, and on-site “gorilla guides” to answer questions <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> interesting facts. The exhibit is home to two gorilla troops.|$|E
25|$|Five {{years after}} the new Mudawana laws were passed, the {{president}} of the ADFM noted that opposition to its reforms was still present throughout the judicial system. While polygamy had become nearly nonexistent, she noted, one out of every ten marriages still involved a minor as of 2007, and the system was facing organizational challenges. Some reports claim that marriage of underage girls has actually risen since the passing of the reforms, <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that the actual existence of separate marital property contracts remains low, despite their being newly legalized, meaning that the reforms offer little actual protection to women whose husbands order them to leave the marital home.|$|E

25|$|Hegel's {{influence}} was immense both within philosophy {{and in the}} other sciences. Throughout the 19th century many chairs of philosophy around Europe were held by Hegelians, and Søren Kierkegaard, Ludwig Feuerbach, Marx, and Friedrich Engels—among many others—were all deeply influenced by, but also strongly opposed to, many of the central themes of Hegel's philosophy. Scholars continue to find <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> Hegelian influences and approaches {{in a wide range of}} theoretical and/or learned works, such as Carl von Clausewitz's magnum opus on strategic thought, On War (1831). After less than a generation, Hegel's philosophy was suppressed and even banned by the Prussian right-wing, and was firmly rejected by the left-wing in multiple official writings.|$|E
25|$|Maake {{was arrested}} in December 1997 as a suspect of the “Wemmer Pan” murders and {{initially}} acknowledged responsibility for the crimes. He cooperated with police officers on several occasions to lead them around the vicinity <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> the locations of his crimes. The data generated by this was later used with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and crime mapping technology to provide diagrams of the geographical extent of the serial murders. The Wemmer Pan serial killer trial {{was one of the}} earliest uses of GIS to aid in court prosecution by the SAPS. Geographic profiling later revealed that the majority of Maake's murders were centered on his two residences, the place where he worked, and the residences of his brother and girlfriend.|$|E
25|$|The Socialist Party, however, {{refused to}} condemn the McNamara brothers, arguing that their actions were {{justified}} {{in view of the}} supposed employer- and state-sponsored terror their union had faced for the last 25 years.

But let him be one of them himself, reared in hard poverty, denied education, thrown into the brute struggle for existence from childhood, oppressed, exploited, forced to strike, clubbed by the police, jailed while his family is evicted, and his wife and children are hungry, and he will hesitate {{to condemn the}}se as criminals who fight against the crimes of which they are the victims of such savage methods as have been forced upon them by their masters.|$|E

25|$|The {{region is}} set to reach a final {{decision}} {{on the future of}} I-81 with input from many local groups, or stakeholders. In early May 2011, this official process was started by two entities: NYSDOT and the Syracuse Metropolitan Transportation Council (SMTC), the region’s metropolitan planning organization. NYSDOT is responsible for overseeing the process and, eventually, its construction. SMTC consists of member agencies that have a stake in transportation decisions in Central New York. Both parties have yet to reach a decision, but they hope to eventually reach one that {{is in the best interest}} for everyone in the greater Syracuse area. In late March 2011, SMTC and NYSDOT announced the formation of the I-81 Community Liaison Committee (CLC). The CLC is made up of representatives from 37organizations and will give ideas <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> concerns about the future of I-81 in Syracuse.|$|E
25|$|After {{the entire}} saga was over, Sun Quan sent Yuan Li (袁禮) as his {{personal}} representative {{to meet all}} his senior generals and make an apology on his behalf. He also tasked Yuan Li with seeking their views on how the system could be reformed and improved. However, to his disappointment, his generals Zhuge Jin, Bu Zhi, Zhu Ran and Lü Dai gave the excuse {{that they were not}} in charge of civil affairs and said that civil affairs were best left to civil officials such as Lu Xun and Pan Jun. Sun Quan then wrote an emotional letter to them, blaming himself for the mistakes and urging them to give him honest advice <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> his mistakes. Throughout the entire saga, Bu Zhi had written to Sun Quan numerous times to defend those who were wrongly accused and to urge Sun Quan to rehabilitate Lü Yi's victims. Although Sun Quan did not accept every piece of advice, Bu Zhi's efforts ultimately saved many officials from doom.|$|E
25|$|The {{wife of the}} Belgian judge took a {{liking to}} Mobutu and taught him to speak, read, and write the French {{language}} fluently. Yemo relied on the help of relatives to support her four children, and the family moved often. Mobutu's earliest education took place in Léopoldville, but his mother eventually sent him to an uncle in Coquilhatville, where he attended the Christian Brothers School, a Catholic-mission boarding school. A physically imposing figure, he dominated school sports. He also excelled in academic subjects and ran the class newspaper. He was also known for his pranks and impish sense of humor. A classmate recalled that when the Belgian priests, whose first language was Dutch, made an error in French, Mobutu would leap to his feet in class <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> the mistake. In 1949 Mobutu stowed away aboard a boat to Léopoldville and met a girl. The priests found him several weeks later.
