5|$|Fossas are {{occasionally}} held {{in captivity}} in zoos. They first bred in captivity in 1974 {{in the zoo}} of Montpellier, France. The next year, at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> were only eight fossas in the world's zoos, the Duisburg Zoo in Germany acquired one; this zoo later started a successful breeding program, and most zoo fossas now descend from the Duisburg population. Research on the Duisburg fossas has provided much data about their biology.|$|E
5|$|Halo.Bungie.Org is {{the most}} widely read Halo fansite. In 2007, it {{received}} about 600,000 page views a day. The site covers game news and rumors, strategy, fan-made machinima, stories and art, contests and forums. In the site's early years, it received {{only a small amount}} of fan-submitted material, which has ballooned since and made constant site maintenance a challenge. Errera attributes the site's longevity {{to the fact that it}} provided fans with not just Halo news but a place to share their love of the franchise. At <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> was no easy video sharing via YouTube, Halo.bungie.org posted and categorized Halo films that fans submitted.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Bonds {{first became}} {{embroiled in a}} scandal when Greg Anderson of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO), Bonds's trainer since 2000, was indicted by {{a federal grand jury}} in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and charged with {{supplying}} anabolic steroids to athletes, including a number of baseball players. This led to speculation that Bonds had used performance-enhancing drugs during <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> was no mandatory testing in Major League Baseball. Bonds declared his innocence, attributing his changed physique and increased power to a strict regimen of bodybuilding, diet, and legitimate supplements.|$|E

5|$|In {{temperate}} areas, {{the male}} owl moults rather {{later in the}} year than the female, at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> is an abundance of food, the female has recommenced hunting and the demands of the chicks are lessening. Unmated males without family responsibilities often start losing feathers earlier in the year. The moult follows a similar prolonged pattern to that of the female and the first sign that the male is moulting is often when a tail feather has been dropped at the roost. A consequence of moulting is the loss of thermal insulation. This is of little importance in the tropics and barn owls here usually moult a complete complement of flight feathers annually. The hot-climate moult may still take place over a long period but is usually concentrated at a particular time of year outside the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, the club's home {{moved from}} the Antônio Carlos to the newer and larger Estádio Independência. The season saw another Campeonato Mineiro triumph and the club's first European tour, in which it played ten games in five countries. The {{excursion}} happened at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> were neither regular national competitions in Brazil nor continental ones in South America, and followed soon after the traumatic Maracanazo. The tour and Atlético's results, many of which achieved under adverse weather conditions and snow, were seen by national sports media as a historic achievement for Brazilian football itself. The team, captained by Zé do Monte, was dubbed the Campeões do Gelo ("Ice Champions"), a title that is remembered in the club's official anthem. The club's success in the state competition continued in the 1950s, a decade that saw the rise of forward Ubaldo and five consecutive Campeonato Mineiro victories from 1952 to 1956. After another state league title in 1958, Atlético {{took part in the}} inaugural edition of the Taça Brasil in the following year, reaching the third round. The tournament, the country's first annual nationwide competition, was a cup contested between state league champions, originally created by the CBD to select Brazil's entrants in the newly formed Copa Libertadores.|$|E

50|$|Bodybuilding {{for women}} {{began to take}} off during the 1970s at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> {{culturally}} <b>there</b> was <b>a</b> tension between governmental attempts to control women's bodies, and women trying to exert control using their own physicality. Bodybuilding was seen by some women as form of recognition of their physical strength.

500|$|CMJ New Music Monthly writer Andrew Bonazelli noted musical {{similarities}} to fellow Victory band Thursday. In Tell All Your Friends, [...] "a series of double teams, two guitars butt heads", merging [...] "clean-channel pop melodies" [...] with [...] "chugging metal progressions" [...] to create [...] "cathartic, schizophrenic anthems". Bonazelli called the songs [...] "bombast" [...] and [...] "occasionally dazzling". Stuart Green of Exclaim! {{wrote that the}} album was [...] "a spirited and well-produced" [...] work, although noting it arrived [...] "at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>there's</b> <b>a</b> flood of similar sounding bands. It's not bad, but it just doesn't stand out either." [...] Olli Siebelt wrote for BBC Music that the band brought [...] "a welcome mix of original styles to an overcrowded playing field", with [...] "an interesting mix of southern Californian post-punk, nu-metal and old school hardcore". According to Siebelt, Taking Back Sunday composed [...] "fantastically catchy songs" [...] which were [...] "poppy and fun" [...] and [...] "upbeat and emotionally aggressive." [...] Siebelt compared the album to All and the Descendents, retaining [...] "enough of its own identity" [...] to lift the band above its peers.|$|R

50|$|Overall, {{the season}} {{continued}} the general {{trend in the}} 1980s of near to above-average seasons in the East Pacific. Seventeen cyclones formed. Eight peaked at tropical storm strength.

On August 28, three systems were active, one of <b>a</b> few <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> has been three tropical cyclones active simultaneously (Kiko, Lorena, and Manuel) in the east Pacific (west of 140°W). Despite the activity this season, no named storms formed in October. This was the second consecutive season this happened.|$|R
50|$|Since most of {{the colonies}} formed by the species Metapolybia {{cingulata}} are done so through usurpation, <b>there</b> is <b>a</b> <b>time</b> period <b>when</b> <b>there</b> are two queens present in the same colony.

This competition is especially evident in smaller colonies because their presence greatly alters the social structure. In fact, monogyny is most likely seen in these species so that no inter-queen competition has to occur. Queen aggressive interaction has also been observed.|$|R
