5|$|After {{watching}} an advertisement on television for Duff Gardens, Homer, Bart and Lisa decide to go. As they prepare to leave, Marge tells them that spinster Great Aunt Gladys died <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> going to her funeral instead. The Simpsons, along with Patty and Selma, drive to Littleneck Falls to attend her funeral and {{the reading of}} her will. On the video will, Great Aunt Gladys tells Patty and Selma not to die alone, as she did. Selma hears the ticking of her biological clock, and decides she wants a child. Selma tries video dating, but gets rejected by Groundskeeper Willie. She goes to a psychic who tries to sell her a love potion. The psychic ingests it, blurts out the innocuous ingredients and discovers that she accidentally drank a truth serum. Selma dates Hans Moleman after revoking his license at the DMV. All goes well until Hans tries to kiss her goodnight; Selma envisions herself {{as the mother of}} several ugly, blind children and kicks Hans out of the car to prevent that future from happening. Lisa then suggests to Selma that she go through artificial insemination.|$|E
5|$|Giant planets can {{significantly}} influence terrestrial planet formation. The presence of giants tends to increase eccentricities and inclinations (see Kozai mechanism) of planetesimals and embryos in the terrestrial planet region (inside 4AU in the Solar System). If giant planets form too early, they can slow or prevent inner planet accretion. If they form {{near the end}} of the oligarchic stage, as is thought to have happened in the Solar System, they will influence the merges of planetary embryos, making them more violent. As a result, the number of terrestrial planets will decrease <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> more massive. In addition, the size of the system will shrink, because terrestrial planets will form closer to the central star. The influence of giant planets in the Solar System, particularly that of Jupiter, is thought to have been limited because they are relatively remote from the terrestrial planets.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} talk of {{building}} a replica of the memorial.

A National Boer War Memorial Committee was formed prior to that date, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> conducting a national competition to find a design for the new memorial. In the design brief for the memorial, the committee state that it is their desire to build a memorial along the same lines as Adelaide's: {{going so far as to}} say that they would be willing to accept a replica of the statue from the South Australian memorial if the original mould could be located or if a duplicate could otherwise be produced.|$|E

25|$|Several {{species of}} birds have {{acquired}} methods {{that allow them to}} ingest monarchs without experiencing the ill effects associated with the cardiac glycosides. The oriole is able to eat the monarch through an exaptation of its feeding behavior that gives it the ability to identify cardenolides by taste and reject them. The grosbeak, on the other hand, has developed an insensitivity to secondary plant poisons that allows it to ingest monarchs without vomiting. As a result, orioles and grosbeaks will periodically have high levels of cardenolides in their bodies, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> forced to go on periods of reduced monarch consumption. This cycle effectively reduces potential predation of monarchs by 50 percent and indicates that monarch aposematism has a legitimate purpose.|$|E

25|$|After his {{retirement}} from the bench, Innes was free {{once again to}} express his political views, and especially his staunch Cape liberal commitments. In 1929, when Prime Minister J. B. M. Hertzog was intensifying plans to strip black Africans of their rights, Innes founded the Non-Racial Franchise Association to protect the beleaguered Cape Qualified Franchise and extend it {{to the rest of}} the country. At the Association's opening function he said:"In a comparatively short time, we shall have to deal with a great body of Natives whose education has enabled them to appreciate the value of the political status denied them, and has stimulated their determination to obtain it, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> embittered by the grievances, economic and administrative which are bound to accumulate when one section of the people is deprived of those voting rights which its fellow citizens enjoy.|$|E

A few only are harmonious, and consequently at once useful and beautiful, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> capable of affecting the geometrician's special sensibility I have been speaking of; which, once aroused, will direct our attention upon them, and will thus give them the opportunity of becoming conscious... In the subliminal ego, on the contrary, there reigns what I would call liberty, if one could give this name to the mere absence of discipline and to disorder born of chance.|$|E
25|$|The {{experience}} gained {{in designing the}} Project 17 Shivalik-class frigates will {{be applied to the}} Project 17A (P17A). The Project 17A frigates will improve upon the Project 17 (P17) in terms of stealth. They will have covered mooring deck and the number of antennae on the ship will be reduced by using a AESA radar. The P17A will also feature better roll stabilisation and a discreet visual profile. The weapon platform in the P17A ships will be compact <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> armed with the Barak 8 (missile) surface-to-air missile developed jointly by India and Israel, and the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile. The weapon systems will be flush deck mounted allowing vertical launch of missiles from under the deck. The crew complement will be reduced from the existing 257 (including 35 officers) to about 150 by using high levels of automation, which will reduce the operational costs by around 20 per cent and result in higher operational availability of the warships. The construction times will be reduced and productivity will improved by using modular integrated construction. The ship will have a displacement of 6,670 tonnes.|$|E

[...] He also praised the game's multiplayer mode over Xbox Live and highlighted the selection of weapons, the satisfying gunplay, and leaderboards, noting that they allow players to compare their performance with their friends.|$|E
500|$|Sirius is the {{brightest}} star in the night sky at apparent magnitude −1.46 and one of the closest stars to Earth at a distance of 8.6 light-years. Its name comes from the Greek word for [...] "scorching" [...] or [...] "searing". Sirius is also a binary star; its companion Sirius B is a white dwarf with a magnitude of 8.4—10,000 times fainter than Sirius A to observers on Earth. The two orbit each other every 50 years. Their closest approach last occurred in 1993 <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> at their greatest separation between 2020 and 2025. Sirius was the basis for the ancient Egyptian calendar.

500|$|In 2014, the CCDI {{established}} an internal Office for the Supervision of Disciplinary System Officials.

The CCDI intends [...] "zero tolerance" [...] towards CDI officials breaching discipline themselves, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> [...] "exposed by {{name in the}} media" [...] if they break the rules. That year, the CCDI set up offices in bodies directly reporting to the central committee (such as the Organisation and Propaganda Departments) and State Council bodies.

500|$|Mobius {{features}} a tactics-focused, turn-based battle system, with players able to activate attacks by tapping enemies on screen. Players can use standard melee attacks with close-range weapons such as swords, and magical attacks. During combat the player accumulates Elements, which {{are necessary to}} activate Abilities, the game's form of summoned monsters. When ready for activation, a tile appears on-screen that the player touches to activate the Ability. Abilities have different attributes: the Shiva Ability unleashes an ice attack, while the Fat Chocobo Ability raises defense for eight turns while automatically healing the player. Elements {{can also be used}} by the player to strengthen their resistance to elemental attacks. If an enemy's weakness is struck enough times, their [...] "break gauge" [...] meter will be drained <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> left weakened, allowing the player to attack freely. A job system and character abilities related to them form {{a key part of the}} system.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1993, Jackson was accused {{of child sexual abuse}} by a 13-year-old boy, Jordan Chandler, and his father, Evan Chandler, a dentist. The Chandler family demanded payment from Jackson, which he refused. Jordan Chandler {{eventually}} told the police that Jackson had sexually abused him. Jordan's mother was, however, adamant that there had been no wrongdoing on Jackson's part. Evan was recorded discussing his intention to pursue charges, saying, [...] "If I go through with this, I win big-time. There's no way I lose. I will get everything I want <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> destroyed forever..... Michael's career will be over." [...] Jackson used the recording to argue that he was the victim of a jealous father whose only goal was to extort money. In January 1994, after an investigation, deputy Los Angeles County district attorney Michael J. Montagna stated that Chandler would not be charged with extortion, due to lack of cooperation from Jackson's party and its willingness to negotiate with Chandler for several weeks, among other reasons.|$|E
