Signal decay curves are extracted from the 16 left ventricular (LV) segments and the fitting of these curves to a mono-exponential model provides the corresponding T 2 * values. In patients with severe cardiac iron overload, where signal will decay quickly becoming comparable to image noise, manual truncation of signal decay curves excluding later echo times (TEs) is adopted. In this study an <b>automatic</b> <b>truncation</b> method avoiding the variability associated with the manual selection of the truncation point is introduced and validated.

T 2 * map generation procedures should join a processing time compatible with on-line image analysis with a good precision in the entire T 2 * range of clinical interest. Fast generation of T 2 * maps can be achieved by the estimation of the T 2 * values by the weighted linear fitting of the logarithm of the signal (WLSL) method. This approach fails if the signal decay diverges from a pure exponential decay, as happens at low T 2 * values where the rapid decay in the signal intensity leads to a plateau in the later echo times (TE). The proposed method implements the <b>automatic</b> <b>truncation</b> of the signal decay curves to be fitted in order to compensate for the signal collapse at low T 2 * values, allowing the extension of the WLSL method through the entire clinical range of T 2 * values. Validation was performed on synthetic images and on 60 thalassemia major patients with different levels of myocardial iron overload. Phantom experiments showed that a 5...|$|E

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{has emerged}} as a major design concern for embedded and portable electronics. Conventional ap-proaches typically impact performance and often require sig-nificant design-time modifications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for improving energy efficiency through judicious fusion of operations. The proposed approach has two major distinctions: (1) the fusion is enabled by operand truncation, which allows representing multiple operations into a reasonably sized lookup table (LUT); and (2) it works for large varieties of functions. Most applications in the do-main of digital signal processing (DSP) and graphics can tolerate some computation error without large degradation in output quality. Our approach improves energy efficiency with graceful degradation in quality. The proposed fusion approach can be applied to trade-off energy efficiency with quality at run time and requires virtually no circuit or archi-tecture level modifications in a processor. Using our software tool for <b>automatic</b> fusion and <b>truncation,</b> the effectiveness of the approach is studied for four common applications. Sim-ulation results show promising improvements (19 - 90 %) in energy delay product with minimal impact on quality...|$|R
