5|$|It was {{announced}} on 22 March 2013 that West Ham {{had signed a}} 99-year lease for the Olympic Stadium after the government agreed to put in an extra million towards the costs of converting the site. The club's plan was {{to move into the}} stadium {{prior to the start of}} the 2016–17 season. Supporters of rival clubs had pressed for an inquiry into the granting of West Ham's tenancy, arguing that West Ham were being given <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>advantage</b> by the arrangement. In September 2015, however, the government rejected holding such an inquiry.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 Pistorius {{applied to}} run in non-disabled track meets. He was at first accepted, but {{questions}} quickly arose about whether the blades give him <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>advantage.</b> After initial research showed the blades did provide an advantage, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) changed their rules to ban the use of technical devices that provide an advantage and ruled him ineligible to compete. Pistorius challenged the ruling with additional research and was reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2008, meaning that he can continue {{to run in}} non-disabled meets {{as long as he}} uses the equipment that was studied in the research.|$|E
5|$|The {{ethos of}} the {{aristocracy}} as exemplified in the English public school greatly influenced Pierre de Coubertin. The public schools subscribed {{to the belief}} that sport formed an important part of education, an attitude summed up in the saying mens sana in corpore sano, a sound mind in a sound body. In this ethos, a gentleman was one who became an all-rounder, not the best at one specific thing. There was also a prevailing concept of fairness, in which practising or training was considered tantamount to cheating. Those who practised a sport professionally were considered to have <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>advantage</b> over those who practised it merely as a hobby.|$|E
50|$|The {{main point}} to {{consider}} regarding <b>an</b> <b>Unfair</b> Competitive <b>Advantage</b> {{is that the}} same opportunities are not available to everyone; unless the possessor of the <b>Unfair</b> Competitive <b>Advantage</b> decides to grant permission for people to share the opportunity.|$|R

5|$|Windsor Park is {{the largest}} Association {{football}} stadium in Northern Ireland, with Glentoran's ground, the Oval, being the next largest. The governing body of Northern Irish football, the Irish Football Association, leases the ground {{for use by the}} Northern Ireland national football team. The club currently receives 15% of Northern Ireland international gate receipts as rent. This is controversial as rival Irish League clubs see this as giving Linfield <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>advantage</b> by allowing them to offer more attractive wages and have a larger squad than all of the other clubs. In 2010, UEFA provided €500,000 towards substantial refurbishment of the stadium, to increase capacity and improve safety.|$|E
5|$|For the 2010 Ski Flying World Cup season, {{beginning}} in Oberstdorf, and from thereon used at all ski flying and ski jumping events, a supplementary points system was introduced. This system {{takes into account}} the wind speed and direction during each jump, as well as mid-round start gate adjustments, in order to enable a more fair contest. If a headwind is present, this is deemed <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>advantage</b> and points are therefore deducted as 'compensation'; if a tailwind is present, this is deemed to be a disadvantage and additional points are awarded instead. The amount of deduction or addition is calculated via coefficient using complex instrumentation which analyses the wind conditions at the time of a jump, and the value of the points themselves are in minimum increments of 0.1.|$|E
5|$|Neal has won {{re-election}} in every term since. Former Springfield mayor Theodore Dimauro, reflecting sentiments that Neal had <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>advantage</b> {{in the previous}} election, ran as a challenger in the 1990 Democratic primary. Dimauro's campaign was sullied by a false rumor he spread about the Bank of New England's financial situation, and Neal won the primary easily. He was unopposed in the general election, winning 68 percent of the vote. In 1992 his popularity was threatened by the House banking scandal, {{in which he had}} made dozens of unpenalized overdrafts at the House Bank. After narrowly defeating two Democratic opponents, he was challenged by Republican Anthony W. Ravosa, Jr., and Independent Thomas R. Sheehan. Neal won with 53 percent of the vote.|$|E

5|$|Liberty Property Trust {{hoped to}} get the One Pennsylvania Plaza site {{designated}} a Keystone Opportunity Improvement Zone (KOZ). KOZ designation was intended to encourage development in poor, blighted areas by exempting the tenants of the building from all state and local taxes. Designating One Pennsylvania Plaza a KOZ was supported by then Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, who said {{it was important to}} keep corporations within the city. At the time, many of Philadelphia's big employers' leases, including Comcast's, were due to expire, and the employers were considering the possibility of moving out of the city and state. Rendell also said allowing Comcast to enlarge its headquarters by moving into One Pennsylvania Plaza could attract other corporate headquarters to the city. However, other Center City building owners, including Comcast's landlord at Centre Square, HRPT Properties Trust, were opposed to the plan. They said giving the tower the KOZ designation would give it <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>advantage</b> because Liberty Property Trust could charge above-market rents since the tax breaks would offset the cost for tenants. The group believed tenants attracted to One Pennsylvania Plaza because of the tax breaks would cause more vacancies in other Center City skyscrapers, rather than attracting more business to blighted areas as intended under the law. In early 2004, Center City had a vacancy rate of 12.8%.|$|E

During Russia's transition {{to a market economy}} in the 1990s, in which these assets were sold, Sberbank provided no guarantee for citizens' deposits. This resulted in a landslide depreciation, which in turn led to severe discontent among the Russian population. Since 1996, partial compensation for investors' losses has been offered - however, {{it must be noted that}} this only applied to state-owned banks such as Sberbank until 2003, offering them <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>advantage.</b>|$|E
