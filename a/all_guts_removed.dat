5000|$|The {{writing for}} {{several of the}} songs on Necrocacy began during the {{preceding}} <b>All</b> <b>Guts,</b> No Glory session. Harvey indicated that the tempo variation heard on Necrocacy was a conscious decision that emerged while playing shows in support of <b>All</b> <b>Guts,</b> No Glory: [...] "the live shows really convinced me that what the last album really lacked was any kind of slower, heavier groove stuff, so I knew early on that I wanted to incorporate more {{of that kind of}} shit into Necrocracy." ...|$|R
50|$|Usually, {{the green}} (i.e., fresh) {{herrings}} with the heads and <b>guts</b> <b>removed</b> are either breaded or simply turned in flour, then fried, and finally pickled in a marinade of white vinegar and briefly boiled water, onion, salt, spices like pepper, bay leaves, mustard seeds, {{and a little}} sugar. The thin bones of the green herring are partially dissolved in the marinade, so that they hardly interfere with eating.|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, {{the band}} {{recorded}} <b>All</b> <b>Guts,</b> No Glory. The album line up was Harvey on guitars and high vocals, del Muerte on bass and low vocals, Caley on guitar and Danny Walker on drums. The musical approach taken on <b>All</b> <b>Guts,</b> No Glory was, according to Harvey, intentionally {{based on the}} band members' favoured elements of previous Exhumed records: [...] "We all agreed that the period of Exhumed we liked the best was Slaughtercult and wanted to mix that with the technicality and melody of Anatomy." ...|$|R
50|$|Bokkoms {{are similar}} to dried herring, as well as bloaters, kippers and {{buckling}}. Bloaters (whole fish), kippers (split) and buckling (head and <b>guts</b> <b>removed)</b> are <b>all</b> lightly salted and smoked {{for a short period}} of time. Although the method for making bokkoms probably originated from the European method of making dried herring, bokkoms use a different species of fish (the mullet) and do not regularly make use of smoking in preparation of the delicacy.|$|R
5000|$|<b>All</b> <b>Guts,</b> No Glory was {{generally}} well-received, with most critics observing that the album {{stepped away from}} the technicality of the previous studio album, Anatomy Is Destiny. Thom Jurek of Allmusic wrote, [...] "while not returning to the band's gore-grind demo era of yore, <b>All</b> <b>Guts,</b> No Glory is a more stripped-to-the-bone and go-straight-for-the-entrails outing than 2003's Anatomy Is Destiny". However, Joe Reviled of Metal Underground wrote that the album is not a simple return to the looser performance of Gore Metal, noting, [...] "the music is dense and overwhelming, but precise, revelling purely in the blood-soaked insanity." ...|$|R

40|$|The {{techniques}} and management methods practised at the 'Inverliever rainbow trout farm', a pilot scheme situated south of Oban, in Scotland, are described. Subterranean water is pumped (rate of flow approx 35 m super(3) /min) into lake Awe {{which has a}} surface area of approx 60 km super(2). The pumped water is channelled along 126 raceways (42 series of 3) each measuring 30 m in length and 1. 80 m in breadth. After use the water is emptied back into the lake via a 50 m pipe which opens {{at a depth of}} 15 m {{at the bottom of the}} lake. The distribution of food pellets is ensured every 3 hr for adult fish and more frequently for younger fish. The stock of eggs obtained from reproducing females in the basins is supplemented by imported eggs from Denmark and USA in winter and Australia and Tasmania in summer. The eggs are incubated and the young reared until they weigh 4 - 5 g. Fish weighing 180 - 240 g are selected, the <b>guts</b> <b>removed,</b> suitably packed and immediately frozen...|$|R

The remaining carcass and all organs were dried to a constant mass in an oven at 60 °C (for at least 72 h) and then weighed again {{to obtain the}} dry mass.

40|$|Obesity is {{a chronic}} disease {{characterized}} by persistent low-grade inflammation with alterations in gut motility.

Recent studies have revealed that the gut microbiota can affect obesity and increase inflammatory tone by modulating mucosal barrier function.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Zinc (Zn) is {{protective}} {{and enhances}} epithelial repair in gut diseases. In {{this study we}} investigate the localization and distribution of Zn and its binding protein, metallothionein (MT), in the gut of rats fed diets varying in Zn content. METHODS: Male-Sprague Dawley rats were fed low, normal, high, or excess Zn in their diets (10, 100, 400, or 1000 mg Zn/kg, respectively) and killed 7 days later. Blood, liver, and gut tissues were collected. Tissue Zn was determined with atomic absorption spectrophotometery and MT with a Cd/haem affinity assay. Zn and MT were immunohistochemically localized in the small-intestinal wall with zinquin and an anti-MT antibody. RESULTS: Most Zn in the intestinal wall was present in the mucosal scrapings, with 94 % membrane-bound and 6 % cytosolic, irrespective of dietary Zn. MT levels increased in <b>all</b> <b>gut</b> regions at dietary Zn levels above 100 mg Zn/kg. MT was 40 % higher in the ileum than in other gut regions in rats fed low- and normal-Zn diets. The Zn content of the ileum was also 20 % {{higher than that of}} other gut regions in rats fed low-, normal-, or high-Zn diets. Zn and MT were colocalized in the base of the intestinal crypts, most visibly in the ileum. CONCLUSION: Mucosal cytosolic Zn and MT concentrations are increased only at high or excessive Zn intakes in <b>all</b> <b>gut</b> regions except the ileum, which can respond to a lower Zn intake. As the cytosolic Zn pool most likely influences mucosal protection and repair mechanisms, it is proposed that an increased MT may indicate the adequacy of oral Zn therapy in gut disease...|$|R
