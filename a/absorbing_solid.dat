5000|$|Reviews of The Brood were {{generally}} mixed to positive. Despite this, the film holds a 'fresh' rating of 78% on aggregate review site Rotten Tomatoes, {{with an average}} rating of 7/10 based on 18 reviews. While Variety called it [...] "an extremely well made, if essentially unpleasant shocker", Leonard Maltin reviewed the film in two sentences: [...] "Eggar eats her own afterbirth while midget clones beat grandparents and lovely young schoolteachers to death with mallets. It's a big, wide, wonderful world we live in!" [...] and rated it an outright [...] "BOMB". Roger Ebert called it [...] "a bore" [...] and [...] "disgusting {{in ways that are}} not entertaining", and even went as far as asking, [...] "Are there really people who want to see reprehensible trash like this?" [...] In Cult Movies, Danny Peary, who openly disapproves of Shivers and Rabid, calls The Brood [...] "Cronenberg's best film" [...] because [...] "we care about the characters", and, although he dislikes the ending, [...] "an hour and a half of <b>absorbing,</b> <b>solid</b> cinema". In his An Introduction to the American Horror Film, critic Robin Wood views The Brood as a reactionary work portraying feminine power as irrational and horrifying, and the dangerous attempts of Oliver Reed's character's psychoanalysis as an analogue to the dangers of trying to undo repression in society.|$|E

40|$|Major {{attention}} {{is given to}} the existence and structure of a 'magnetic sheath' adjacent to perfectly <b>absorbing</b> <b>solid</b> surfaces. The basic equations for a two-field continuum model are presented, and the quasi-neutral approximation and Bohm's criterion are briefly reviewed. The infinite conductivity MHD equations are recovered by invoking the small magnetic Debye length approximation. This approximation is relaxed, and the appropriate 'boundary layer' equation for the magnetic sheath is presented. The first magnetic sheath criterion is derived, which states that the conditions {{at the edge of the}} sheath, as characterized by a point in the Friedrichs diagram, must be located in certain restricted regions in order for a magnetic sheath to exist. The second magnetic sheath criterion is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} of two-phase droplets to intense radiant heating is studied {{to determine the}} incident power that is required for causing explosive boiling in the liquid phase. The droplets studied consist of strongly absorbing coal particles dispersed in a weakly absorbing water medium. Experiments are performed by confining droplets (radii of 37, 55, and 80 microns) electrodynamically and irradiating them from two sides with pulsed laser beams. Emphasis {{is placed on the}} transition region from accelerated droplet vaporization to droplet superheating and explosive boiling. The time scale observed for explosive boiling is more than 2 orders of magnitude longer than published values for pure liquids. The delayed response is the result of energy transfer limitations between the <b>absorbing</b> <b>solid</b> phase and the surrounding liquid...|$|E
40|$|A source-driven {{magnetized}} presheath is {{analyzed in}} an obliquely incident magnetic field. The conventional fluid treatments of the collisionless and collisional magnetized presheath use standard fluid equations {{to recover the}} velocity profiles that satisfy the Bohm sheath criterion at the electrostatic sheath edge. In a purely source-driven collisionless presheath, however, there is no mechanism to redistribute the change in parallel energy in the perpendicular direction and therefore the boundary values of flow velocities are strong functions of angle of incidence. In the present treatment, numerical solutions are obtained {{for a set of}} fluid equations derived from the moment description of a generalized gyrokinetic equation. The density, velocity, and temperature profiles in a source-driven presheath are computed, which show a dependence on the angle of incidence of the magnetic field on a perfectly <b>absorbing</b> <b>solid</b> surface...|$|E

However, the analysis shows ambiguity. Here, we describe an analysis which yields {{a complete set of}} mathematical solutions and show how the physically relevant can be deduced. We present a comprehensive mathematical survey for parameter extraction. We have recorded the THz spectra of anthracene and the fatty acid capric acid as examples for weakly <b>absorbing</b> <b>solid</b> samples, and an ionic liquid as an example for a strongly absorbing liquid sample.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{electromagnetic}} coupling and concomitant heating of a particle in a miniaturized trap {{close to a}} solid surface. Two dominant heating mechanisms are identified: proximity fields generated by thermally excited currents in the <b>absorbing</b> <b>solid</b> and time-dependent image potentials due to elastic surface distortions (Rayleigh phonons). Estimates for the lifetime of the trap ground state are given. Ions are particularly sensitive to electric proximity fields: for a silver substrate, we find a lifetime below one second at distances closer than some ten ¯m to the surface. Neutral atoms may approach the surface more closely: {{if they have a}} magnetic moment, a minimum distance of one ¯m is estimated in tight traps, the heat being transferred via magnetic proximity fields. For spinless atoms, heat is transferred by inelastic scattering of virtual photons off surface phonons. The corresponding lifetime, however, is estimated to be extremely long compared to the timescale of typical exper [...] ...|$|E

Oxygen discharged from the roots of Phragmites communis oxidizes soil in a resolving state, and promotes the activation and dissolution of nearby microorganisms.

Different porous structures for typical commercial cells and innovative electrode designs obtained using a freeze-casting process are studied. Taking advantage of the geometrical setup and the use of high energy X-rays, both large reconstructions (field of view: 150 A mu m) and local tomography at higher resolution (field of view: 50 A mu m) can be performed on the same sample to have a multi-scale approach. This produces highly representative sample volumes with a size/resolution ratio that allows the geometric and physical properties of the materials to be calculated, e. g., connectivity of each phase, mean particles diameters, specific surface area, particle size distributions, tortuosity factors, and densities of triple boundary lengths...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetized}} plasma-wall transition (PWT) region typically exhibits three characteristic subregions: the “Debye sheath”, the “magnetic presheath”, and the “collisional presheath”. The fluid {{boundary conditions}} for transport codes (simulating, e. g., the scrape-off layer (SOL) of a tokamak) are usually applied at the “magnetic presheath entrance”, {{where in the}} simplest model the ion velocity parallel to the magnetic field equals the local sound velocity. After reviewing the basic time-independent and collisionless models of the magnetized PWT, various extensions will be discussed which are due to E×B, ∇B and diamagnetic drifts, non-uniformity of the electric field parallel to the wall, and turbulence effects. In practically all cases considered, quantitative results can be obtained only by massive application of numerical methods of solution. Key words: Plasma sheath; plasma-wall transition 1.

Their stored hydrogen density is nearing that of liquid hydrogen. But they are heavy and the weight is their main disadvantage. Current usable metal hydrides can hold no more than about 1. 8 percent hydrogen by weight. However much effort is underway to find lighter materials.

This phenomenon, termed persorption, was investigated in detail. Absorption In the physiology of digestion, the concept of absorption is taken to mean the uptake of a substance by the absorptive cells (enterocytes) of the intestine. This takes place by three mechanisms: diffusion is a passive process for the enterocyte, in which substances of lower molecular dimensions ( 250 mol) are carried through the enterocytes {{with the help of}} enzymes; cytopempsis (micropinocytosis) transports particles in the nanometer (nm) size range through the enterocytes. The transportation through the enterocytes is effected in small vesicles (plasma membrane vesiculation). Also small crystals and fibers of nanometer size can be incorporated by means of cytopempsis (Fig. 1). Persorption In addition to the process of absorption, however, macrocorpuscular particles, whose diameter is well within the micrometer (Arm) range, are regularly incorporated.
