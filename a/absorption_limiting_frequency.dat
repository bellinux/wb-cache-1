30|$|In recent decades, {{electromagnetic}} interference (EMI) problem has emerged {{due to the}} increasing use of electronic devices and communication facilities in most areas, leading to complex electromagnetic environment. An effective way to solve the problem is developing EM wave absorbing materials, which can absorb EM wave effectively and convert EM energy into thermal energy or dissipate the EM waves by interference. Therefore, considerable efforts have been made to develop strong, lightweight, and broadband absorbing materials [1, 2, 3]. Typically, traditional materials such as ferrite, graphite, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been used for EM wave absorption materials due to their high conductivity and good dielectric properties [4, 5, 6]. However, these materials cannot reach the standards of ideal EM wave absorption materials. The high density, corrosion susceptibility, and narrow bandwidth of <b>absorption</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>limit</b> ferrite’s applications [7, 8, 9]. Similarly, graphite has poor dispensability and relatively low absorbing abilities. Likewise, CNTs are economically non-viable, difficult to produce at bulk scale and require purification, auxiliary treatment, and functionalization steps [10, 11]. Therefore, designing and fabricating new type of EM wave absorption materials are highly demanded.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effectiveness}} of hair bundle motility in mammalian and avian ears is studied by examining energy balance {{for a small}} sinusoidal displacement of the hair bundle. The condition that the energy generated by a hair bundle must be greater than energy loss due to the shear in the subtectorial gap per hair bundle leads to a <b>limiting</b> <b>frequency</b> that can be supported by hair-bundle motility. <b>Limiting</b> <b>frequencies</b> are obtained for two motile mechanisms for fast adaptation, the channel re-closure model and a model that assumes that fast adaptation is an interplay between gating of the channel and the myosin motor. The <b>limiting</b> <b>frequency</b> obtained {{for each of these}} models is an increasing function of a factor that is determined by the morphology of hair bundles and the cochlea. Primarily due to the higher density of hair cells in the avian inner ear, this factor is ∼ 10 -fold greater for the avian ear than the mammalian ear, which has much higher auditory <b>frequency</b> <b>limit.</b> This result is consistent with a much greater significance of hair bundle motility in the avian ear than that in the mammalian ear...|$|R
30|$|In {{the general}} case, when seismic {{motions of the}} bottom {{take place in the}} real ocean, not only forced {{oscillations}} are generated, but also gravity and acoustic waves, the contribution of which to pressure variations at the ocean bottom violates the linear relationship between quantities p and a. However, the manifestation of gravity waves in pressure variations at the ocean bottom is limited by a maximum <b>limit</b> <b>frequency</b> f_g= 0.366 √(g/H). And, the existence of hydroacoustic waves is restricted by a minimum <b>limit</b> <b>frequency</b> f_ac=c/ 4 H. Therefore, forced oscillations are realized in a pure form within the frequency band f_g<f<f_ac, while the linear relationship p=ρHa_z is clearly observed in cross-spectra and in power spectra of the signals. Theoretical values of the <b>limit</b> <b>frequencies</b> f_g and f_ac are quite consistent with the observed boundaries of the forced oscillation band. The clear relationship observed between pressure variations of the ocean bottom and the vertical component of acceleration makes possible its utilization as a convenient way for mutual verification of pressure gauges and accelerometers in situ.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The <b>limit</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the {{positions}} {{in the game of}} Monopoly are calculated on the basis of Markov chains. In order to make the process Markovian some minor modifications in the rules are necessary. A parameter is introduced so that by varying this parameter we can determine how distorted our mode is compared with the actual game. The convergence properties of Markov chains are so nice that it was feasible to use hand computation. A neat trick with power series {{played an important role in}} determining how the <b>limit</b> <b>frequencies</b> depend on the parameter. A method for determining higher eigenvalues is illustrated. These eigenvalues yield a good estimate on the rapidity of convergence to the limit frequencies: to within one percent after 20 turns. Finally, expected income from the bank and expected rents on properties are calculated from the <b>limit</b> <b>frequencies.</b> This allows us to give a quantitative estimate of the relative value of the various properties. 1.
