5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata in Weimar, but the composition history is complicated <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> stages certain. Findings by Martin Petzoldt {{suggest that the}} cantata began with the later movements 2–6 and 9, most of them on biblical text, performed at a memorial service of Aemilia Maria Haress, {{the wife of a}} former prime-minister of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, at the church St. Peter und Paul in Weimar on 8 October 1713. Bach may then have expanded it and presented it for his application in December 1713 at the Liebfrauenkirche in Halle. The performance material of this event, the only surviving source, shows on the title page the designation , indicating that the cantata with its general readings and texts is suitable for any occasion.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the planning, things went awry for the Confederates. While Pickett's division had not been used yet at Gettysburg, A.P. Hill's health became an issue and he did not participate in selecting which of his troops were to be used for the charge. Some of Hill's corps had fought lightly on July 1 <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> on July 2. However, troops that had done heavy fighting on July 1 ended up making the charge.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{have only}} had one home ground, Stamford Bridge, where they have played since the team's foundation. It was officially opened on 28 April 1877 {{and for the first}} 28 years of its {{existence}} it was used almost exclusively by the London Athletic Club as an arena for athletics meetings <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> for football. In 1904 the ground was acquired by businessman Gus Mears and his brother Joseph, who had also purchased nearby land (formerly a large market garden) with the aim of staging football matches on the now 12.5acre (51,000m²) site. Stamford Bridge was designed for the Mears family by the noted football architect Archibald Leitch, who had also designed Ibrox, Craven Cottage and Hampden Park. Most football clubs were founded first, and then sought grounds in which to play, but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge.|$|E

25|$|The {{composition}} of Lutetia has puzzled astronomers for some time. While classified among the M-type asteroids, {{most of which}} are metallic, Lutetia is one of the anomalous members that do not display much evidence of metal on their surface. Indeed, there were various indications of a non-metallic surface: a flat, low frequency spectrum similar to that of carbonaceous chondrites and C-type asteroids <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> like that of metallic meteorites, a low radar albedo unlike the high albedos of strongly metallic asteroids like 16 Psyche, evidence of hydrated materials on its surface, abundant silicates, and a thicker regolith than most asteroids.|$|E
25|$|The {{defection}} {{of many of}} {{the senior}} Australian players to join World Series Cricket in 1977 led to speculation that Watson would be a contender for the Australian team in the 1978/79 Ashes series against England. However, after impressive early performances, Watson had a disappointing season in 1978/79, taking only 13 first-class wickets for New South Wales at average just under 50. He returned for another season with Worcestershire in 1979, but played only nine times in first-class cricket (taking 22 wickets at 37.50) <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> in the one-day format; from mid-July onwards he had to satisfy himself with a diet consisting entirely of Second XI games.|$|E

25|$|In 1924, Leach {{played only}} once for Lancashire in mid-season, again without success, and then unusually {{appeared}} for Somerset in an end-of-season match against the South Africans, {{in which he}} made 13 and 0. Not qualified for Somerset to play County Championship matches, he played only once {{in each of the}} 1925 and 1926 seasons, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> in 1927. But in 1928, he was finally qualified to play and he was picked in five early-season matches; but he was not a success and his highest score was just 27, made in the match against Nottinghamshire. Finally dropped mid-season, he did not appear again in first-class cricket.|$|E
25|$|The hedonic {{treadmill}} theory originally {{proposed that}} most people return to a neutral level of SWB (i.e. neither happy nor unhappy) as they habituate to events. However, subsequent {{research has shown that}} for most people, the baseline level of SWB is at least mildly positive, as most people tend to report being at least somewhat happy in general and tend to experience positive mood when no adverse events are occurring. Additional refinements to this theory have shown that people do not adapt to all life events equally, as people tend to adapt rapidly to some events (e.g. imprisonment), slowly to others (e.g. the death of a loved one), <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> to others (e.g. noise and sex).|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} Auburn Barron-Lutzross showed no {{correlation}} between sexual identity and any phonetic variables, but did show that speakers' self-assessed “familiarity with queer culture” had a statistically significant correlation with phonetic variation. Higher familiarity with queer culture was correlated with lower median pitch and faster rate of speech. However, this correlation existed most strongly for straight women, less so for bisexual women, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> for lesbian women. Barron-Lutzross theorized that because lesbians are stereotyped as having a lower mean pitch, the straight women may have been attempting to express their affinity with queer people by adopting a lower pitch, because of their awareness {{of the purpose of}} the study.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Higgins' English {{career was}} barely noticeable: he played twice {{in each of}} the 1924 and 1925 seasons, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> in 1926. The next three years, however, were to prove by some margin his most {{successful}} in the game. He played 19 or 20 matches for Worcestershire every summer, and hit one century in each, the highest of these being the first: 123 against Glamorgan at Kidderminster in July 1927. He scored those runs from number three in the order, but his other two centuries were both made as an opener. In 1928 he reached 1,000 first-class runs in a season for the only time, hitting 1,041 at an average of 30.61.|$|E
25|$|Baynton was {{the younger}} brother of the actor-manager Henry Baynton; he trained at Birmingham University as a dentist. In {{first-class}} cricket, he was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a left-arm medium pace bowler. After a couple of matches in 1921 for Warwickshire, he played fairly regularly {{in the second half}} of the 1922 season as an amateur, without making a decisive impact on any match. His best batting came in the game against Lancashire when he made his best score of 36, batting at No 9, and was top scorer in the Warwickshire first innings. His best bowling was four wickets for 56 runs in the game against Nottinghamshire in the same season. He played only once in the 1923 season <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> thereafter.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to refusing to grant visas, Bahraini authorities had detained several journalists. On 31 March 2011, four CNN journalists were detained {{on a charge}} of not having proper documents. The journalists stated they did possess the correct documents, however, they were not able to conduct the interviews they had scheduled because of their source's fear of being arrested. When the same journalists attempted to interview the president of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, Rajab, at his home, six military vehicles arrived and 20 masked men surrounded the CNN team and Rajab and deleted all of the photos. Another CNN reporter, Mohammed Jamjoom, was expelled from Bahrain on 16 March, the same day he arrived. He said he was asked to leave without any explanation and a government official escorted him to the airport. CNN produced a documentary about the use of Internet technology and social media in the Arab Spring, including a 13-minute segment on the Bahraini uprising that reported repressive conduct by the government; CNN aired the documentary only once in the United States <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> on CNN International.|$|E

25|$|It is a predatory species, {{with several}} studies {{conducted}} to determine its diet and feeding habits. A study in the Cape Blanc region found Branchiostoma lanceolatum (a cephalochordate), euphausiids, small fish and other small crustaceans were the predominantly taken food items, with a surprising absence of copepods which other small species {{included in the study}} did take. This lack of copepods in the false scad's diet was also noticed in an earlier similar study, which looked at the diet of slightly smaller fish. A much later study in the same location found similar results, with fish being the most common prey followed by crustaceans including shrimps and mysids, molluscs and annelids. There is a change in the diet of the species as it grows, with one study finding 23 to 30cm long fish took Branchiostoma lanceolatum predominantly, 30 to 35cm fish took euphausiids and mysids, while 35 to 55cm fish consumed small fishes of the families Maurolicidae and Carangidae predominantly. A similar pattern has been seen in other studies, with a general pattern of decreasing amounts of crustaceans and increasing amounts of small fish consumed as the fish grows. Seasonal variation in prey items is also known, with crustaceans dominating the diet during autumn and winter, while small fish are more frequently taken in summer. The feeding intensity of the species is lowest during the winter months, with the species feeding predominantly around mid day, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> during the night.|$|E
