5|$|Using {{the stellar}} spectrum, <b>astronomers</b> <b>can</b> also {{determine}} the surface temperature, surface gravity, metallicity and rotational velocity of a star. If {{the distance of}} the star is found, such as by measuring the parallax, then the luminosity of the star can be derived. The mass, radius, surface gravity, and rotation period can then be estimated based on stellar models. (Mass can be calculated for stars in binary systems by measuring their orbital velocities and distances. Gravitational microlensing has been used to measure the mass of a single star.) With these parameters, <b>astronomers</b> <b>can</b> also estimate the age of the star.|$|E
5|$|For {{at least}} a portion of its life, a star shines due to {{thermonuclear}} fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then radiates into outer space. Almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are created by stellar nucleosynthesis during the star's lifetime, and for some stars by supernova nucleosynthesis when it explodes. Near {{the end of its}} life, a star can also contain degenerate matter. <b>Astronomers</b> <b>can</b> determine the mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), and many other properties of a star by observing its motion through space, its luminosity, and spectrum respectively. The total mass of a star is the main factor that determines its evolution and eventual fate. Other characteristics of a star, including diameter and temperature, change over its life, while the star's environment affects its rotation and movement. A plot of the temperature of many stars against their luminosities produces a plot known as a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (H–R diagram). Plotting a particular star on that diagram allows the age and evolutionary state of that star to be determined.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} {{observations}} is made of the spectrum of light emitted by a star. Periodic variations in the star's spectrum may be detected, with the wavelength of characteristic spectral lines in the spectrum increasing and decreasing regularly {{over a period of}} time. Statistical filters are then applied to the data set to cancel out spectrum effects from other sources. Using mathematical best-fit techniques, <b>astronomers</b> <b>can</b> isolate the tell-tale periodic sine wave that indicates a planet in orbit.|$|E
50|$|The van Cittert-Zernike theorem {{is crucial}} to the {{measurement}} of the brightness distribution of a source. With two telescopes, a radio astronomer (or an infrared or submillimeter <b>astronomer)</b> <b>can</b> measure the correlation between the electric field at the two dishes due to some point from the source. By measuring this correlation for many points on the source, the <b>astronomer</b> <b>can</b> reconstruct the visibility function of the source. By applying the van Cittert-Zernike theorem, the <b>astronomer</b> <b>can</b> then take the inverse Fourier transform of the visibility function to discover the brightness distribution of the source. This technique is known as aperture synthesis or synthesis imaging.|$|R
50|$|Surveys {{also help}} astronomers obtain {{observation}} time on larger, more powerful telescopes. If the <b>astronomer</b> <b>can</b> show a telescope scheduling committee that previous observations support {{his or her}} hypothesis, {{he or she is}} more likely to be given a chance to make more detailed observations.|$|R
2500|$|The wide {{scope of}} surveys makes them ideal for astronomers searching for moving {{foreground}} {{objects such as}} asteroids and comets. [...] An <b>astronomer</b> <b>can</b> compare existing survey images to current observations to locate targets which are in motion; this task can even be performed automatically using image analysis software. [...] Similarly, images of the same object taken by different surveys {{can be compared to}} detect transient events such as variable stars.|$|R
25|$|Although {{stars in}} constellations appear near {{each other in}} the sky, they usually lie at a variety of {{distances}} away from the observer. Since stars also travel along their own orbits through the Milky Way, the constellation outlines change slowly over time. After tens to hundreds of thousands of years, their familiar outlines gradually become unrecognisable. <b>Astronomers</b> <b>can</b> predict the past or future constellation outlines by measuring their individual stars common proper motions or cpm by accurate astrometry and their radial velocities by astronomical spectroscopy.|$|E
500|$|Astronomers {{may make}} [...] "Target of Opportunity" [...] proposals, in which {{observations}} are scheduled if a transient event {{covered by the}} proposal occurs during the scheduling cycle. In addition, up to 10% of the telescope time is designated [...] "director's discretionary" [...] (DD) time. <b>Astronomers</b> <b>can</b> apply to use DD time {{at any time of}} year, and it is typically awarded for study of unexpected transient phenomena such as supernovae.|$|E
500|$|MOA-2009-BLG-387L is an M-type {{red dwarf}} in the Sagittarius constellation. It is {{estimated}} to be 5700 parsecs (18,591 light years) away, although uncertainty has led the discovering team to place the confidence intervals at ± 2200 parsecs (7,176 light years); in other words, although the distance of MOA-2009-BLG-387L from Earth is best placed at 5700 parsecs, <b>astronomers</b> <b>can</b> only be 90% certain that it is somewhere between 3,500 and 7,900 parsecs away. Likewise, although MOA-2009-BLG-387L's mass has been estimated at 0.19 times that of the Sun, the confidence intervals remain large (...) , as uncertainty in the mass of the planet places its true mass between 0.07 and 0.49 times the mass of the Sun. This covers the entirety of the range of masses known in red dwarfs.|$|E
50|$|In {{combination}} with other improvements such as narrow-pass filters and improved eyepieces, the large apertures of the Dobsonian have dramatically increased the depth to which an amateur <b>astronomer</b> <b>can</b> penetrate into the universe. Whereas the amateur astronomer of the 1970s and 1980s typically did not explore much beyond the Messier and brighter NGC objects, the amateur astronomer of today, {{thanks in part to}} Dobsonians, can routinely observe objects in the IC, Abell, Perek Kohoutek, Minkowski, and other obscure catalogues once considered the domain only of professional astronomers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{provenance}} of The <b>Astronomer</b> <b>can</b> {{be traced}} back to 27 April 1713, when it was sold at the Rotterdam sale of an unknown collector (possibly [...] or his father, of Rotterdam) together with The Geographer. The presumed buyer was Hendrik Sorgh, whose estate sale held in Amsterdam on 28 March 1720 included both The Astronomer and The Geographer, which were described as ‘Een Astrologist: door Vermeer van Delft, extra puyk’ (An Astrologist by Vermeer of Delft, topnotch) and ‘Een weerga, van ditto, niet minder’ (Similar by ditto, no less).|$|R
5000|$|The van Cittert-Zernike theorem has {{important}} implications for radio astronomy. With the exception of pulsars and masers, all astronomical sources are spatially incoherent. Nevertheless, because they are observed at distances large enough to satisfy the van Cittert-Zernike theorem, these objects exhibit a non-zero degree of coherence at different points in the imaging plane. By measuring the degree of coherence at different points in the imaging plane (the so-called [...] "visibility function") of an astronomical object, a radio <b>astronomer</b> <b>can</b> thereby reconstruct the source's brightness distribution and make a two-dimensional map of the source's appearance.|$|R
500|$|Being {{distant from}} the Sun and major planets, Kuiper belt objects {{are thought to be}} {{relatively}} unaffected by the processes that have shaped and altered other Solar System objects; thus, determining their composition would provide substantial information on the makeup of the earliest Solar System. Due to their small size and extreme distance from Earth, the chemical makeup of KBOs is very difficult to determine. The principal method by which astronomers determine the composition of a celestial object is spectroscopy. When an object's light is broken into its component colors, an image akin to a rainbow is formed. This image is called a spectrum. Different substances absorb light at different wavelengths, and when the spectrum for a specific object is unravelled, dark lines (called absorption lines) appear where the substances within it have absorbed that particular wavelength of light. Every element or compound has its own unique spectroscopic signature, and by reading an object's full spectral [...] "fingerprint", <b>astronomers</b> <b>can</b> determine its composition.|$|E
2500|$|NASA's Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission {{satellite}} was monitoring Comet Lulin as {{it closed}} to 63 Gm of Earth. For the first time, <b>astronomers</b> <b>can</b> see simultaneous UV and X-ray {{images of a}} comet. [...] "The solar wind—a fast-moving stream of particles from the sun—interacts with the comet's broader cloud of atoms. This causes the solar wind to light up with X-rays, and that's what Swift's XRT sees", said Stefan Immler, of the Goddard Space Flight Center. This interaction, called charge exchange, results in X-rays from most comets when they pass within about three times Earth's distance from the Sun. Because Lulin is so active, its atomic cloud is especially dense. As a result, the X-ray-emitting region extends far sunward of the comet.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the waves}} from the Earth–Sun system are minuscule, <b>astronomers</b> <b>can</b> point to other sources {{for which the}} {{radiation}} should be substantial. One important example is the Hulse–Taylor binary — a pair of stars, {{one of which is}} a pulsar. The characteristics of their orbit can be deduced from the Doppler shifting of radio signals given off by the pulsar. Each of the stars is about [...] and the size of their orbits is about 1/75 of the Earth–Sun orbit, just a few times larger than the diameter of our own Sun. The combination of greater masses and smaller separation means that the energy given off by the Hulse–Taylor binary will be far greater than the energy given off by the Earth–Sun system — roughly 1022 times as much.|$|E
60|$|Astronomy {{teaches the}} correct {{use of the}} sun and the planets. These may be put on a frame of little sticks and turned round. This causes the tides. Those at the ends of the sticks are {{enormously}} far away. From time to time a diligent searching of the sticks reveals new planets. The orbit of a planet is the distance the stick goes round in going round. Astronomy is intensely interesting; it should be done at night, in a high tower in Spitzbergen. This is to avoid the astronomy being interrupted. A really good <b>astronomer</b> <b>can</b> tell when a comet is coming too near him by the warning buzz of the revolving sticks.|$|R
40|$|The new {{generation}} of 21 st century 8 m ground-based telescopes requires {{a new model of}} proposal submission. The proposal submission tool must be globally accessible and provide an efficient mechanism to create a proposal and submit it for review. Global accessibility is dependent on network availability and connection time should be minimized to reduce this dependency. The efficiency of the tool is optimized by implementing checks which ensure that the proposal is complete before it reaches the reviewers. This saves the reviewers from having to contact the astronomer for additional information and the astronomer is assured that her/his proposal will not be rejected for its incompleteness. The Gemini Phase 1 Science Proposal Entry Tool is a platform-independent software program which is downloaded from the web to reside on the astronomer’s local machine. During the creation of a science proposal, no network connection is required. Input is entered through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) which consists of a series of pages. The <b>astronomer</b> <b>can,</b> for the most part, page around the GUI entering the information in any order. However, in some cases, data that determines what is displayed on other pages must be entered before advancing to the next page. Local saves and prints of the proposal can be made at any time. Also, the tool can reload an existing proposal so that the <b>astronomer</b> <b>can</b> work on a proposal over several sittings. Completed pages are indicated on a floating screen separate from the main GUI. When the astronomer is ready to submit the proposal, the file is verified for completeness. If complete, it is submitted to the National Time Allocation Committee via ftp...|$|R
40|$|The current {{generation}} of Grid infrastructures designed for production activity is strongly computing oriented and tuned {{on the needs of}} applications that requires intensive computations. Problems arise when trying to use such Grids to satisfy the sharing of data-oriented and service-oriented resources as happens in the IVOA community.

60|$|In {{the very}} beginning, {{so far as}} the mental vision of the <b>astronomer</b> <b>can</b> dimly pierce with {{hypothetical}} glance the abyss of ages, the matter which now composes the material universe seems to have existed in a highly diffuse and nebulous condition. The gravitative force, however, with which every atom of the whole vast mass was primarily endowed, caused it gradually to aggregate around certain fixed and definite centres, which became in time the rallying-points or nuclei of future suns. The primitive potential energy of separation in the atoms of the mass was changed into actual energy of motion as they drew closer and closer together about the common centre, and into molecular energy or heat as they clashed with one another in bodily impact around the hardening core. Thus arose stars and suns, composed of fiery atomic clouds {{in a constant state of}} progressive concentration, ever gathering-in the hem of their outer robes on the surface of the solid globe within, and ever radiating off their store of associated energy to the impalpable and hypothetical surrounding ether. This, in necessarily brief and shadowy abstract, is the nebular theory of Kant and Laplace, as amended and supplemented by the modern doctrine of the correlation and conservation of energies.|$|R
