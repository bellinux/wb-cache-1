Eventually, after a delay of 50 years, chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) was diagnosed in the index patient. We found a new splice mutation in the NCF 2 (p 67 -phox) gene, c. 1000 + 2 T → G, that led to several splice products one of which lacked exons 11 and 12. This deletion was in frame and allowed for remarkable residual NADPH oxidase activity as determined by transduction experiments using a retroviral vector. We conclude that p 67 -phox which lacks the 34 amino acids encoded by the two exons can still exert considerable functional activity. This activity can partially explain the long-term survival of the patients without adequate diagnosis and treatment, but could not prevent progressing lung damage...|$|R

50|$|The {{ability of}} bioaerosols to cause human disease depend {{not only on}} their {{chemical}} composition and biological characteristics, {{but also on the}} quantity of bioaerosol inhaled and their size distribution, which determines the site of bioaerosol deposition to human respiratory systems.

5000|$|Extrinsic <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis</b> (EAA) is {{also caused}} by Aspergillus clavatus with a Type 1 immune reaction.

50|$|Studies {{have shown}} {{that people who are}} atopic (sensitive), already suffer from allergies, asthma, or {{compromised}} immune systems and occupy damp or moldy buildings are at an increased risk of health problems such as inflammatory and toxic responses to mold spores, metabolites and other components.

Other problems are respiratory and/or immune system responses including respiratory symptoms, respiratory infections, exacerbation of asthma, and rarely hypersensitivity pneumonitis, <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis,</b> chronic rhinosinusitis and allergic fungal sinusitis. Severe reactions are rare but possible. A person's reaction to mold depends on their sensitivity and other health conditions, the amount of mold present, length of exposure and the type of mold or mold products.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Plasma {{cells are}} usually absent in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Extrinsic <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis</b> is {{associated}} with increased numbers of T and B lymphocytes in BAL fluid, {{as well as the}} presence of a few plasma cells. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether there is a relationship between the presence of plasma cells and other cells, and immunoglobulin levels in BAL fluid of patients with extrinsic <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis.</b> METHODS [...] Thirty non-smoking patients with extrinsic <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis</b> who had a bronchoalveolar lavage 2 - 7 days after their last exposure to the causative antigen were selected, retrospectively. RESULTS [...] Patients suffering from extrinsic <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis</b> with plasma cells in the BAL fluid (n = 18) had increased absolute numbers of lymphocytes, eosinophils and mast cells, a decreased percentage of alveolar macrophages and lower CD 4 /CD 8 ratio, as well as higher immunoglobulin levels, when compared with patients with extrinsic <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis</b> having no plasma cells in the BAL fluid (n = 12). CONCLUSIONS [...] The results suggest a relationship between the presence of plasma cells and the other constituents in BAL fluid and a more intense alveolitis. In addition there was a positive relationship between the number of plasma cells in BAL fluid and immunoglobulin levels. These data support the concept of local production of immunoglobulins by plasma cells in the lung following antigen exposure in susceptible individuals...|$|E

40|$|The role of {{antioxidant}} defense {{mechanisms in}} {{the pathogenesis of}} granulomatous human lung diseases remains open to investigation. In this study we investigated the immunoreactivity of two important superoxide radical scavenging intracellular antioxidant enzymes, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and copperzinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), in pulmonary sarcoidosis and extrinsic <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis.</b> In histologically normal lung MnSOD was variable but mostly positive in the cells of bronchial epithelium, alveolar epithelium especially in type II pneumocytes, and alveolar macrophages. Copperzinc SOD showed positive immunoreactivity most markedly in the bronchial epithelium. The biopsies of 22 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis and 10 with extrinsic <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis</b> indicated that MnSOD was highly stained in the granulomas of both diseases, with 60 to 100 % of the granulomas showing intensive immunoreactivity. Western blots conducted on the cell samples of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid revealed significantly higher amounts of MnSOD in sarcoidosis and extrinsic <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis</b> than in the controls. Immunohistochemistry on the cells obtained from BAL fluid showed positive immunoreactivity of MnSOD in the macrophages {{but not in the}} lymphocytes.

40|$|A 34 {{year old}} sawmill {{maintenance}} engineer developed a dry cough that {{was associated with}} widespread wheezes and crackles in his lungs. His symptoms worsened, with work related lethargy, fever, and breathlessness, {{and the loss of}} a stone in weight. At that time, while still at work, he had a neutrophil leucocytosis and increased concentration of gamma globulins. When seen subsequently some two months after stopping work, his chest radiograph and lung function tests were normal, but the cells recovered at bronchoalveolar lavage showed an increase in lymphocytes and mast cells, a pattern consistent with extrinsic <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis.</b> Serum precipitins were identified to extracts of sawdust, wood chips, and bark from the sawmill, and to eight species of mould grown from these samples. Specific IgG binding inhibition studies suggested that a common epitope present on Trichoderma koningii might be responsible for the cross reactivity of the patient's serum with the wood and fungal extracts. A diagnosis of wood associated extrinsic <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis</b> was made and since changing his job the patient has remained well.

40|$|Extrinsic <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis</b> and {{pulmonary}} sarcoidosis are granulomatous {{diseases of}} the lung for which clinical presentation and anatomic site of granuloma formation differ. Extrinsic <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis</b> is caused by inhaled antigens, whereas the nature and source of the inciting antigen in sarcoidosis is unknown. To test {{the hypothesis that the}} route via which antigen is introduced to the lung contributes to the clinicopathological presentation of pulmonary granulomatous disease, rats immunized with intravenous (i. v.) Corynebacterium parvum were challenged after 2 weeks with either intratracheal (i. t.) or i. v. C. parvum. The granulomatous inflammation elicited by i. t. challenge predominantly involved alveolar spaces and histologically simulated extrinsic <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis.</b> In contrast, the inflammation induced by i. v. challenge was characterized by granulomatous angiitis and interstitial inflammation simulating sarcoidosis. Elevations of leukocyte counts and TNF levels in bronchoalveolar fluid, which reflect inflammation in the intra-alveolar compartment, were much more pronounced after i. t. than after i. v. challenge. Tumor necrosis factor, interleukin- 6, CC chemokine, CXC chemokine, and adhesion molecule mRNA and protein expression occurred in each model. In conclusion, i. t. or i. v. challenge with C. parvum in sensitized rats caused pulmonary granulomatous inflammation that was histologically similar to human extrinsic <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis</b> and sarcoidosis, respectively. Although the soluble and cellular mediators of granulomatous inflammation were qualitatively similar in both disease models, the differing anatomic source of the same antigenic challenge was responsible for differing clinicopathological presentations...|$|E
