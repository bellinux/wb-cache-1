40|$|Porous {{ceramics}} have a {{wide range}} of applications at all length scales, ranging from ﬁ ltration membranes and catalyst supports to biomaterials (scaffolds for bone ingrowths) and thermally or <b>acoustically</b> <b>insulating</b> bulk <b>materials</b> or coating layers. Organic pore-forming agents (PFAs) of biological origin can be used to control porosity, pore size and pore shape. This work concerns the characterization and testing of several less common pore-forming agents (lycopodium, coffee, ﬂ our and semolina, poppy seed), which are of potential interest from the viewpoint of size, shape or availability. The performance of these new PFAs is compared to that of starch, which has become a rather popular PFA for ceramics during the last decade. The PFAs investigated in this work are in the size range from 5 μm (rice starch) to approximately 1 mm (poppy seed), all with more or less isometric shape. The burnout behavior of PFAs is studied by thermal analysis, i. e. thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis. For the preparation of porous alumina ceramics from alumina suspensions containing PFAs traditional slip casting (into plaster molds) and starch consolidation casting (using metal molds) are used in this work. The resulting microstructures are investigated using optical microscopy, combined with image analysis, as well as other methods (Archimedes method of double-weighing in water, mercury intrusion porosimetry) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{refrigeration}} is {{the process}} of removal of heat from the system under controlled conditions. <b>Insulating</b> <b>material</b> is the one of the main sub systems.

Below 100 nA, electrical charging of <b>insulating</b> <b>materials</b> was prevented. The probe current of 10 nA was suitable for qualitative analysis because the intensities of peaks from these materials were strong enough to detect trace elements at the concentration of 0. 1 wt. % in the sample without interference by sum peaks. Diluted EMI-CH 3 COO can also be used for SEM-EDX quantitative analysis of <b>insulating</b> <b>materials</b> as discharging agents. In contrast, when <b>insulating</b> <b>materials</b> were electrically charged, the obtained spectra contained characteristic X-rays of the <b>insulating</b> <b>materials</b> with low energies and of materials other than the samples such as the sample stage and the collimator in the X-ray detector. This is because electrons from the electron beam were decelerated by and deflected from the <b>insulating</b> <b>materials.</b> By coating the <b>insulating</b> <b>materials</b> with the diluted EMI-CH 3 COO, the deceleration and deflection of the electron beam were prevented...|$|R
