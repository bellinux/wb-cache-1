5|$|Norte Chico {{sites are}} notable for {{exceptional}} collective density, {{as well as}} individual size. Haas argues that the density of sites in such a small area is globally unique for a nascent civilization. During the third millennium BC, Norte Chico may have been the most densely populated <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> (excepting, possibly, northern China). The Supe, Pativilca, Fortaleza, and Huaura River valleys each have several related sites.|$|E
5|$|Unsafe medical {{injections}} play {{a significant}} role in HIV spread in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2007, between 12 and 17% of infections in this region were attributed to medical syringe use. The World Health Organization estimates the risk of transmission as a result of a medical injection in Africa at 1.2%. Significant risks are also associated with invasive procedures, assisted delivery, and dental care in this <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
5|$|Voice casting was {{managed by}} Kris Zimmerman, who chose voice actors {{that seemed to}} suit certain roles: the Matoran were voiced by young adults, while the Turaga were voiced by older actors. The voice actors and their {{performances}} were chosen so they would not sound like they came from a specific <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> instead sound like they came from and belonged in the Bionicle universe. A notable event during recording was a behind-the-scenes incident between Michas and Francis: originally cast in the respective roles of Jaller and Takua, Michas came into a recording session in a muddled state and began reading Takua's lines by mistake. When Francis came in, he read Jaller's lines: when the staff heard them and were favourably impressed, the actors permanently switched roles. Voice acting for the project was mostly done in 2002, but dialogue was re-recorded during Additional Dialogue Recording (ADR) into 2003: approximately 30% of the final film's dialogue was done during ADR. Audio and music post-production was handled by Hacienda Post. The company's president Tim Borquez served as sound supervisor. Mask of Light {{was the first time}} in any media that Bionicle characters spoke.|$|E

25|$|Maize (corn), {{beans and}} squash {{were among the}} {{earliest}} crops domesticated in Mesoamerica, with maize beginning about 7500 BC, squash, as early as 8000 to 6000 BC and beans by no later than 4000 BC. Potatoes and manioc were domesticated in South America. In {{what is now the}} eastern United States, Native Americans domesticated sunflower, sumpweed and goosefoot around 2500 BC.

25|$|In 2013, {{yellow fever}} {{resulted}} in about 127,000 severe infections and 45,000 deaths, with nearly 90% of these occurring in Africa. Nearly {{a billion people}} live in an <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> where the disease is common. It is common in tropical areas of South America and Africa, but not in Asia. Since the 1980s, {{the number of cases}} of yellow fever has been increasing. This is believed to be due to fewer people being immune, more people living in cities, people moving frequently, and changing climate. The disease originated in Africa, from where it spread to South America through the slave trade in the 17th century. Since the 17th century, several major outbreaks of the disease have occurred in the Americas, Africa, and Europe. In the 18th and 19th centuries, yellow fever was seen {{as one of the most}} dangerous infectious diseases. In 1927 yellow fever virus became the first human virus to be isolated.|$|E
