25|$|The T22 series {{reverted to}} the M4 {{transmission}} because {{of problems with}} the early Torqmatic transmission used in the T20. The T22E1 tested an <b>autoloader</b> for the main gun, and eliminated the loader's position with a small two-man turret.|$|E
25|$|The Leclerc is {{equipped}} with a GIAT (Nexter) CN120-26 120mm smoothbore cannon. This cannon is capable of firing the same NATO standard 120mm rounds as the German Leopard 2 and US M1 Abrams, but in practice only French-produced ammunition is issued. The gun is insulated with a thermal sleeve and has an automatic compressed-air fume extraction system instead of the usual bore evacuator. The Leclerc has a unique autoloading system which was specifically designed for it, and reduces the crew to three by eliminating the human loader. The turret of the Leclerc was designed around the auto-loading system {{in order to avoid the}} problems common to other tanks with an <b>autoloader.</b> The Leclerc <b>autoloader</b> allows a rate of fire of 12 shots per minute and holds 22 rounds of ready ammunition; it can accommodate up to six different types of ammunition at once, although like most <b>autoloader</b> systems it cannot change ammunition types once a round has been loaded. The most common types are the armour piercing fin-stabilised discarding sabot (APFSDS) with a tungsten core and the high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) round. There are 18 other rounds available for reload. A Leclerc tank can fire while traveling at a speed of 50km/h on a target 4,000 metres away. The gun is 52 calibres long instead of the 44 calibres common on most tanks of the Leclerc's generation, giving the rounds a higher muzzle velocity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Autoloaders</b> {{are often}} {{implemented}} {{in an attempt}} to save on tank size. The T-64 is an example of this. The current generation of tanks using <b>autoloaders</b> (Russian T-90 and T-14, Japanese Type 90 and Type 10, Chinese Type 98, Korea K2 Black Panther, French Leclerc, Pakistan Al-Khalid MBT) all weigh between 45 - 55 tons. Tanks that do not use <b>autoloaders</b> tend to weigh in the 55 - 70 ton range (American M1A2 Abrams, German Leopard 2, British Challenger 2).|$|R
50|$|Other {{types of}} <b>autoloaders</b> may operate with optical discs (such as compact discs or DVDs) or floppy disks.|$|R
50|$|The Soviet Union's war {{doctrine}} depended {{heavily on}} the main battle tank. Any weapon advancement making the MBT obsolete could have devastated the Soviet Union's fighting capability. The Soviet Union made novel advancements to the weapon systems including mechanical <b>autoloaders</b> and anti-tank guided missiles. <b>Autoloaders</b> were introduced to replace the human loader, permitting the turret to be reduced in size, making the target smaller and less visible, while missile systems were added to extend the range at which a vehicle could engage a target and thereby enhance the first-round hit probability.|$|R
25|$|The primary {{weapon of}} the PL-01 is a 105 or 120 mm cannon fitted within the {{unmanned}} turret, {{in accordance with}} NATO standards. The cannon {{will be able to}} shoot both conventional projectiles and guided anti-tank missiles. It has an <b>autoloader,</b> which ensures a shot fire rate of 6 shots per minute. The vehicle carries 45 rounds, 16 of which are located in slots within the turret and ready to fire, with the remainder stored within the chassis compartment. The tank is also armed with a 7.62 UKM-2000C machine gun with an ammunition supply of 1,000 rounds.|$|E
25|$|The 2A70 rifled gun {{is capable}} of firing guided and unguided shells. 34 {{ready-to-use}} unguided HE-Frag shells are carried in the turret of the vehicle. The 100mm gun is fitted with an <b>autoloader</b> that fires {{at a rate of}} 10-12 rounds per minute, with the time of each shell loading being 5â€“6 seconds. The two variants of HE-Frag shells available for the Bakhcha-U are the 3UOF17 and 3UOF19; the former having a muzzle velocity of 250m/s with the latter achieving 355m/s. The 3UOF19 also provides a substantially larger proximity detonation which increases the lethal radius of the explosion. When implemented in the Bakhcha-U turret, the range of the 2A70 is increased to 7km with its unguided rounds.|$|E
2500|$|The Colorado State Patrol issued 4-inch blue Pythons {{until their}} {{switch to the}} S [...]40 caliber <b>autoloader.</b> Georgia State Patrol and Florida Highway Patrol issued Pythons to their officers.|$|E
50|$|As was {{so often}} the case with the early <b>autoloaders</b> though, their {{complexity}} was their downfall. The 120mm for the AMX-50 was simply unreliable, due to the weight of the ammunition round.|$|R
5000|$|A further {{design for}} the Prodigal {{requirement}} used a pair of the 120 mm recoilless rifles, as used for the WOMBAT, fitted with seven-round revolver <b>autoloaders.</b> The rifles were on a swivelling mounting above a low boat-shaped hull with conventional suspension, crewed by a commander-driver-gunner. The mounting could elevate conventionally. The <b>autoloaders</b> and their ammunition were carried in armoured boxes above the hull, with the reaction nozzles of the recoilless rifle protruding behind. Sighting for these recoilless rifles {{was to be the}} same M8C [...]50 spotting rifles, one for each barrel, as used with the WOMBAT.|$|R
5000|$|T54E1 Tank, Heavy, 105mm Gun - Two {{prototype}} {{vehicles with}} 105mm guns and <b>autoloaders</b> were constructed on the M48 tank chassis. They were constructed around 1952 by United Shoe Manufacturing. One T54 had a conventional turret, the other T54E1 an oscillating turret.|$|R
2500|$|In 1940 a {{modified}} craft, the Motor Gun Boat, was introduced. These were armed with weapons {{such as the}} 0.5 in Vickers machine gun, 2 pounder [...] "pom pom", a single or twin 20 mm Oerlikon and ultimately the <b>autoloader</b> fitted 6-pounder gun.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]284 Winchester is {{an example}} of a commercially {{unsuccessful}} cartridge that has enjoyed a resurgence due to interest from long-range competitive shooters. Introduced by Winchester in 1963, the [...]284 Winchester was designed to squeeze [...]270 Winchester and [...]280 Remington performance from the new Winchester Model 100 <b>autoloader</b> and Winchester Model 88 lever action rifles.|$|E
50|$|The <b>autoloader</b> takes between 7.1 and 19.5 {{seconds to}} load the main weapon (28 rounds), {{depending}} on the initial position of <b>autoloader</b> carousel.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sales of}} the [...] "mechanically ill-fated" [...] weapon lagged {{significantly}} behind those of Remington's and Browning's <b>autoloaders,</b> and Winchester ceased its production in 1925, after producing almost 83,000 of them. As recently as 2005, four people accidentally shot themselves with the 1911 while loading or clearing the weapon.|$|R
50|$|Tape drives can be {{connected}} to a computer with SCSI (most common), Fibre Channel, SATA, USB, FireWire, FICON, or other interfaces. Tape drives are used with <b>autoloaders</b> and tape libraries which automatically load, unload, and store multiple tapes, increasing the volume of data which can be stored without manual intervention.|$|R
5000|$|Quantum's tape {{automation}} portfolio includes SuperLoader <b>autoloaders</b> and Scalar tape libraries. Its Scalar line, {{originally developed}} by ADIC, includes entry-level, midrange and enterprise products. Quantum's Scalar libraries incorporate iLayer management software and the Extended Data Life Management (EDLM) feature, which automatically evaluate {{the integrity of}} tape drives and media within the library.|$|R
50|$|It {{is fed from}} a forty round {{mechanized}} conveyor double-row magazine located {{around the}} turret ring of the BMP. The gun is reloaded by the M3 electromechanical <b>autoloader</b> with ammunition conveyor, but can be reloaded by hand if necessary. The <b>autoloader</b> is not reliable; it can break down from vibration when the vehicle is moving at high speed over rough ground, and its operation is {{a danger to the}} gunner's fingers. With the <b>autoloader,</b> the gun has a rate of fire of 8 rounds per minute. These drawbacks caused the <b>autoloader</b> to be removed in Ob'yekt 765Sp3, Finnish BMP-1 and Swedish Pbv 501. Some units removed the <b>autoloader</b> altogether when new vehicles were delivered, but the mechanized ammunition conveyor magazine was kept.|$|E
50|$|The main {{armament}} is a 2-plane stabilized 125 mm smoothbore {{gun with}} a carousel-style <b>autoloader.</b> The gun may be fired under both computerized and manual control. The tank can carry 42 rounds including 22 in the <b>autoloader.</b> The {{rate of fire}} is 8 rounds per minute using the <b>autoloader,</b> and 2 rounds per minute with manual loading. The Type 99A mounts an improved 125 mm gun.|$|E
50|$|Another Add-On is Advanced Tape Support, for {{backing up}} to {{multiple}} single tape drives simultaneously or to a dual-tape <b>autoloader.</b> Even the Desktop Edition supports backing up {{to a single}} non-autoloader tape drive, but backing up to a single <b>autoloader</b> tape drive requires at least the Single Server Edition.|$|E
50|$|Large {{quantities}} of individual magnetic tapes, and optical or magneto-optical discs may {{be stored in}} robotic tertiary storage devices. In tape storage field they are known as tape libraries, and in optical storage field optical jukeboxes, or optical disk libraries per analogy. Smallest forms of either technology containing just one drive device {{are referred to as}} <b>autoloaders</b> or autochangers.|$|R
50|$|Tandberg Data GmbH is {{a company}} focused on data storage products, {{especially}} streamers, headquartered in Dortmund, Germany. They are the only company still selling drives that use the QIC (also known as SLR) and VXA formats, but also produce LTO along with <b>autoloaders,</b> tape libraries, NAS devices, RDX Removable Disk Drives, Media and Virtual Tape Libraries.|$|R
5000|$|Powder {{charges were}} stored {{separately}} from the shells in a vertical position, presenting much larger surface for a potential hit. Moreover, due to the lower placement of the <b>autoloader's</b> carousel and T-64 smaller roadwheels, the charges were covered only by the thin side armor, {{without the benefit of}} the roadwheels or the side skirts for additional protection.|$|R

5000|$|Additionally, the {{adoption}} of the <b>autoloader</b> was highly controversial for several reasons: ...|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{severing}} {{business association}} with Benelli in 1998, Heckler & Koch replaced their entire line of shotguns with those manufactured by FABARM. [...] The line featured hunting and sport shotguns in over-and-under, side-by-side, semi-automatic <b>autoloaders</b> and pump shotguns including youth models. For military, {{law enforcement and}} home defense use, H&K released four variants of the FP6 model.|$|R
50|$|Another {{weapon that}} is similar to the autocannon is the {{automatic}} grenade launcher. This is usually mounted on a tripod or on a vehicle and is capable of firing explosive shells at a high rate of fire. The main item of distinction is that they fire very low velocity ammunition. Larger forms of artillery have been fitted with <b>autoloaders,</b> which are different.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} <b>autoloaders</b> store their {{ammunition}} in the turret basket, increasing {{the possibility of}} a catastrophic explosion should the armor around the hull or turret be penetrated. More armor protection, and isolation/separation of the ammunition from the crew compartment has traditionally been available in tanks with a human loader, which can decrease the possibility of cook-off, or protect the crew in case of an ammunition explosion.|$|R

5000|$|In 1991, the Houston, Texas firm of Aimco, Inc. {{began making}} an all new {{remake of the}} {{original}} Georg Luger design. At that time Mitchell Arms, Inc., under the [...] "Mitchell" [...] name marketed Aimcoâ€™s [...] "new" [...] parabellum. Stoeger, Inc. bought the rights to market the Texas-built pistols in 1994, and since that time the [...] "Luger" [...] name is once again on these toggle-action <b>autoloaders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Magnetic tape {{data storage}} {{is a system}} for storing digital {{information}} on magnetic tape using digital recording. Modern magnetic tape is most commonly packaged in cartridges and cassettes. The device that performs writing or reading of data is a tape drive. <b>Autoloaders</b> and tape libraries automate cartridge handling. For example, a common cassette-based format is Linear Tape-Open, which comes {{in a variety of}} densities and is manufactured by several companies.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Autoloaders</b> {{converted}} {{to fire the}} [...]460 Rowland Cartridge require a properly designed compensator or ported barrel. Ported barrels have proven viable in managing {{the power of the}} cartridge, but result in somewhat more muzzle flip and felt recoil. Ported barrels can be more readily installed or removed from the slide (moot in a 1911 due to its design)â€”legal in restrictive states like Californiaâ€”without needing to permanently secure the compensator to the barrel.|$|R
