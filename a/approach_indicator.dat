30|$|In Pearson {{correlation}} analyses, it {{was found}} that learning engagement indicator, learning <b>approach</b> <b>indicator,</b> and learning achievement indicator were pair-wise significantly correlated. The strongest positive correlation was between learning engagement and learning approach (r =  0.68, p <  0.01), while the correlation between learning engagement and learning achievement was relatively weak (r =  0.27, p <  0.05). Positive correlations also existed among different evaluation indicators. For example, citizen reading was significantly correlated with learning approach (r =  0.64, p <  0.01) and its three evaluation indicators, i.e., citizen’s mobile learning (r =  0.59, p <  0.01), self-regulated learning (r =  0.43, p <  0.01), and utilization of city online learning platform (r =  0.56, p <  0.01). Citizen reading was also significantly correlated with learning achievement (r =  0.42, p <  0.01) and its two evaluation indicators, i.e., satisfaction with learning environments (r =  0.38, p <  0.01), and learning improvement (r =  0.33, p <  0.01).|$|E
40|$|Assessing {{ecological}} sustainability involves monitoring of indicators and comparison of their states with performance targets that are deemed sustainable. First, a normative model was developed centered on evidence-based knowledge about (a) forest composition, structure, and function at multiple scales, and (b) performance targets derived by quantifying the habitat amount in naturally dynamic forests, and as required for presence of populations of specialized focal species. Second, {{we compared the}} Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification standards’ ecological indicators from 1998 and 2010 in Sweden to the normative model using a Specific, Measurable, Accurate, Realistic, and Timebound (SMART) indicator <b>approach.</b> <b>Indicator</b> variables and targets for riparian and aquatic ecosystems were clearly under-represented compared to terrestrial ones.

40|$|Abstract: Indicators are {{increasingly}} {{recognized as an}} important decision aid tool to translate sustainability issue from theory into practice. However, indicator development for sustainable community development is rather successful than the agricultural sector due to methodological lacuna. The {{aim of this study}} is to develop a methodological framework for indicator development and an essential set of indicators of sustainable rice farming in Bangladesh by adopting participatory multi-stakeholders involvement approach. The study adopted informal discussion with academicians, literature review, online experts ’ survey and focus group discussion with the farmers of three sub-districts that represent irrigated, rainfed lowland and upland rice growing ecosystems. These exercises yielded a set of indicators of three dimensions: economics (6), society (10) and environment (5), as well as a process of deriving indicator system with requisite information. The paper concludes that by employing a true participatory <b>approach</b> <b>indicator</b> development collectively decisive to extract an essential and representative set of indicators. Moreover, the study indicates the more significance of social indicators in promoting rice farming sustainability is Bangladesh. We highlight sustainability indicator development is a fairly demanding and challenging process. However, a blend with stakeholder’s knowledge and local experience enhances the questions of indicator’s applicability and practicability.

40|$|Objective {{approaches}} {{are needed to}} select species for monitoring management effectiveness and to justify conservation investments. We develop and apply two approaches for selecting the most cost-effective and informative indicator species with {{a case study of}} monitoring investments in invasive predator control in south-western Australia. We compared species selected by a qualitative approach involving experts scoring 17 criteria for 12 potential indicators to a quantitative metric based on empirical data for a subset of criteria. Both approaches accounted for the monitoring cost, potential for leverage, data uncertainty and the risk of choosing an un-representative or un-informative indicator, albeit in different ways. The indicator species selected by the quantitative metric was the western brushtail possum Trichosurus vulpecula - a relatively common medium-sized mammal in the study region. When costs were not considered explicitly in the qualitative approach, the indicator selected was the woylie Bettongia penicillata. When costs were sensibly incorporated in the qualitative <b>approach,</b> <b>indicator</b> rankings changed and the top-ranked species was again T. vulpecula. Although when costs were included the qualitative expert-driven approach delivered the same result as the quantitative metric, it was not robust to minor data adjustments, and incorporating expert uncertainty made it difficult to distinguish the value of potential indicator species from each other. The quantitative metric was comparatively robust to minor data adjustments, and enabled evaluation of data uncertainty in a transparent way, presenting a more objective approach that enables explicit selection of the most informative indicator for monitoring management actions.

40|$|Background: In July and September 2006, 3. 4 million {{long-lasting}} insecticide-treated bed nets (LLINs) {{were distributed}} free {{in a campaign}} targeting children 0 - 59 months old (CU 5 s) in the 46 districts with malaria in Kenya. A survey was conducted {{one month after the}} distribution to evaluate who received campaign LLINs, who owned insecticide-treated bed nets and other bed nets received through other channels, and how these nets were being used. The feasibility of a distribution strategy aimed at a high-risk target group to meet bed net ownership and usage targets is evaluated. Methods: A stratified, two-stage cluster survey sampled districts and enumeration areas with probability proportional to size. Handheld computers (PDAs) with attached global positioning systems (GPS) were used to develop the sampling frame, guide interviewers back to chosen households, and collect survey data. Results: In targeted areas, 67. 5 % (95 % CI: 64. 6, 70. 3 %) of all households with CU 5 s received campaign LLINs. Including previously owned nets, 74. 4 % (95 % CI: 71. 8, 77. 0 %) of all households with CU 5 s had an ITN.

40|$|This study {{developed}} and investigated {{responses to a}} new conceptual framework for sustainable tourism indicator development in a Scottish context.   In recent years, growing {{attention has been paid}} to both sustainable tourism indicators and to transparency in decision-making. This has been coupled with calls for academics to set out an underlying theory upon which a sustainability indicator approach could be based (Bell and Morse, 2008). This study responded to these calls. A conceptual framework of seven implicit determinants – concepts which this study contended affected indicator selection but which were not always considered explicitly was developed. Data were gathered from international sustainable tourism indicator authors and experts, stakeholders, and policy-makers.   This enabled an exploration of the relative importance of considering these implicit determinants, familiarity with them, possible links between them, and the potential for additional implicit determinants.   Analysis suggested the framework was of greatest use to strategic level policy-makers and that the framework should be introduced as early as possible into the indicator development process. It was also advocated that the framework should be considered in its entirety. Furthermore, four underlying reasons as to why people might <b>approach</b> <b>indicator</b> selection differently were advanced.   These included an individual’s role in indicator development, the amount of power an individual had, the context (political, institutional and geographical) in which an individual was developing indicators, and an individual’s familiarity with sustainability. This study provided Bell and Morse’s underlying theory to guide indicator selection and decision-taking, the form of a conceptual framework.   This will aid those developing indicators to make explicit decisions regarding the conceptual issues embedded in sustainable tourism indicator development. In doing so, it will increase transparency and improve the process of indicator selection. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
