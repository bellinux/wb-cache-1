40|$|The {{classical}} {{concept that}} mean bed elevation over an entire stream reach is lowered by scour during flood-wave passage and is restored by deposition {{in the waning}} flood phase (mean-bed scour <b>and</b> <b>fill)</b> can be challenged. The alternative that both scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> occur concurrently at different migrating loci within a reach (local scour <b>and</b> <b>fill)</b> is more consistent with published field data. The field and laboratory investigations reported herein suggest that mean-bed scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> in a uniform channel is minor compared to local scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> caused by bedform migration, and that maximum local scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> may occur on the waning flood in some instances. The field experiment, utilizing a rectilinear array of buried maximum-scour indicators (scour-cords), produced data for contouring of maximum scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> in an ephemeral streambed during two floods. In the first flood, 24 em of scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> was measured for a bankfull flow depth of 23 cm. In the second, maximum scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> was at least 66 cm for a bankfull flow depth of 34 cm. Estimates of antidune amplitudes for the two floods, based on theoretical models and laboratory and field observations, are 28 to 64 cm and 48 to 97 cm, respectively. This indicates that all scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> measured by the scour-cord array could {{have been caused by}} antidune migration. Laboratory experiments were conducted in an 18 m-long open-circuit flume with automated sediment and water input-rate controls. A series of experiments in a 26. 7 cm-wide sand-bed channel with rigid walls, at grade for a simulated flood patterned after those typical of ephemeral streams, showed that mean-bed scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> was less than 3 percent of local scour <b>and</b> <b>fill.</b> For these experiments, mean sand size was 0. 3 mm, channel slope was. 009, maximum water depth was 40 mm, maximum local scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> was 22 mm, and maximum mean-bed scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> was 0. 6 mm. Maximum mean bed elevation variation was thus only two sand-grain diameters. Fill occurred at peak flow followed by scour to the pre-flood mean bed elevation on the waning flood. Maximum local scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> took place {{near the end of the}} simulated floods, when bedform amplitudes were the greatest. A series of simulated-flood experiments in a sand-bed channel with erodible sand banks showed scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> behavior qualitatively similar to that of the rigid-wall channel. Bank erosion, channel meandering, and braiding prevented quantitative scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> measurements in these alluvial-bank experiments. Measured flow and bedform parameters <b>and</b> scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> data derived from small laboratory scour-chains were compatible with those estimated from the theoretical model used in the field experiment...|$|R

40|$|The trim <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> method allows {{estimation}} of an adjusted meta-analysis estimate {{in the presence}} of publication bias. To date, the performance of the trim <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> method has had little assessment. In this paper, we provide a more comprehensive examination of different versions of the trim <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> method in a number of simulated meta-analysis scenarios, comparing results with those from usual unadjusted meta-analysis models and two simple alternatives, namely use of the estimate from: (i) the largest; or (ii) the most precise study in the meta-analysis. Findings suggest a great deal of variability in the performance of the different approaches. When there is large between-study heterogeneity the trim <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> method can underestimate the true positive effect when there is no publication bias. However, when publication bias is present the trim <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> method can give estimates that are less biased than the usual meta-analysis models. Although results suggest that the use of the estimate from the largest or most precise study seems a reasonable approach {{in the presence of}} publication bias, when between-study heterogeneity exists our simulations show that these estimates are quite biased. We conclude that in the presence of publication bias use of the trim <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> method can help to reduce the bias in pooled estimates, even though the performance of this method is not ideal. However, because we do not know whether funnel plot asymmetry is truly caused by publication bias, and because there is great variability in the performance of different trim <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> estimators <b>and</b> models in various meta-analysis scenarios, we recommend use of the trim <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> method as a form of sensitivity analysis as intended by the authors of the method. 2009...|$|R

40|$|Seasonal scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> from bankfull flows were {{measured}} in Freshwater Creek, a gravel-bed coastal stream of northern California, {{to test a}} previously developed approach predicting the reach-average and distribution of scour or fill depths based on Shields stress and the exponential function.

Three of the four predicted distributions of scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> depths were statistically different (p< 0. 05) from mea-sured distributions. Differences between predicted and measured values were likely due to scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> patterns in Freshwater Creek that were influenced by sediment supply and location within the channel network, channel form roughness, and possibly multiple peak flows. Consequently, the predictive approach may be better suited for individual peak flows on straight reaches that are in equilibrium between sediment supply and transport, and with form roughness similar to the creeks where the approach was developed.

40|$|Estimates of scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> in {{rivers that}} are derived by {{differencing}} topographic surfaces {{are known to}} be negatively biased by local compensation of scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> between surveys but the magnitude of bias is not well known. This study examines the effect of survey frequency on volumes of scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> over a period of active channel braiding in a small-scale river model. A 100 min, high temporal resolution time series of digital elevation models is artificially coarsened by selectively removing models. The resulting four overlapping time series have survey intervals of 10 min, 20 min, 50 min and 100 min. Cumulative scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> volumes for the 100 min period are compared between the four series. It is concluded that the decay in measured volumes of scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> with increased survey interval can be described using inverse functions. Cumulative scour-fill volumes are approximately 420 per cent greater over the study period for 10 min survey intervals than for a 100 min interval. After the 100 min period of competent flow, nearly 65 per cent of the channel area experienced significant compensation of scour <b>and</b> <b>fill.</b> Several compensation mechanisms were identified in association with braided channel kinetics, including lateral channel migration, the migration of bed forms, and channel avulsion. It is demonstrated that by negatively biasing scour, <b>fill</b> <b>and</b> net estimates, this error significantly affects morphological approaches to the estimation of bed load sediment transport.
