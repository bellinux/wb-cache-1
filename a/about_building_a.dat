5|$|Edward was {{determined}} to prevent any further rebellion in North Wales and set <b>about</b> <b>building</b> <b>a</b> sequence of new castles and walled towns, replacing the old Welsh administrative system with a new principality governed from Caernarfon. Dolbadarn was no longer relevant and within two years timber from the castle was {{being used by the}} Normans for the construction of Caernarfon Castle. This was both a practical and a symbolic action, demonstrating Norman power over {{one of the most important}} possessions of the Welsh princes.|$|E
5|$|Hugh's son, Roger Bigod, {{was out of}} favour with Henry, who {{initially}} denied him the family earldom and estates such as Framlingham. Roger finally regained royal favour when Richard I succeeded to the throne in 1189. Roger then set <b>about</b> <b>building</b> <b>a</b> new castle on the Framlingham site – the work was conducted relatively quickly and the castle was certainly complete by 1213. The new castle comprised the Inner Court, defended with 13 mural towers; an adjacent Lower Court with smaller stone walls and towers, and a larger Bailey with timber defences. By this time, a castle-guard system was in place at Framlingham, in which lands were granted to local lords {{in return for their}} providing knights or soldiers to guard the castle.|$|E

5|$|Richie Barker, Durban's successor, was {{appointed}} manager in 1981. He signed Mickey Thomas from Brighton and Hove Albion and Mark Chamberlain from Port Vale, as he set <b>about</b> <b>building</b> <b>a</b> side for the 1982–83 season. Thomas was signed for £200,000 and made over 60 appearances for the club, but {{was sold to}} Chelsea for £75,000 in 1984. Winger Chamberlain, a £135,00 signing, proved successful as he made eight appearances for England during his stay at Stoke. Barker's spell in charge was short-lived; he was sacked in his second season, 1983–84. The club's new manager, Bill Asprey, decided to bring back veteran Alan Hudson, and the decision paid off as Stoke improved {{during the second half}} of the 1983–84 season and avoided relegation on the final day.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the local}} {{political}} discussion has been <b>about</b> <b>building</b> <b>a</b> stadium, beginning in the 1990s when a Maryland location was chosen for what is now FedExField. With the possibility of building a new stadium in the near future, both the previous and current mayors of the District of Columbia have stated that a name change {{must be part of}} the discussion, however the team rejects that possibiltiy. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe has met with the owner to discuss the building of a new stadium in Virginia. For many years, beginning with the departure of the Baltimore Colts, the Redskins were the only NFL team in a large area from Maryland into the southern states. This is slowly changing as Maryland NFL fans move to the Baltimore Ravens. Several Maryland politicians have stated that the name should change, but the current governor opposes any change, also citing the desire to keep the stadium in Maryland. Virginia fans are now the more numerous and dedicated supporters of the Redskins, and the state and local governments have used economic incentives to encourage the team's relocation of its facilities there, and maintain that the name is entirely a business decision for the team to make. An agency of the commonwealth, the Virginia Lottery, is a sponsor of the team, and says it has never had any complaints.|$|E

25|$|Certain {{issues have}} brought {{criticism}} to missionary activity. This has included concerns that missionaries have a perceived {{lack of respect}} for other cultures. Potential destruction of social structure among the converts has also been a concern. The Akha people of South East Asia are an example of those who believe that missionaries are only converting others for personal gain. The Akha people have complained the missionaries are more worried <b>about</b> <b>building</b> <b>a</b> church than building a clinic in a village that is very unhealthy. Many traditional values of the Akha have been lost {{as a result of these}} conversions.

25|$|After {{the loss}} of Kaiserslautern, the Army of the Moselle withdrew to the Saar while the Army of the Rhine retreated behind the Queich River to Landau.

Möllendorf's offensive quickly {{ground to a halt}} and the Prussians set <b>about</b> <b>building</b> <b>a</b> series of armed camps to hold their newly captured territory. The next action in the theater occurred on 12 and 13 July in the Battle of the Vosges or Schänzel.

25|$|In 1940, Bästlein, Jacob, Abshagen and Gustav Bruhn were {{released}} from Sachsenhausen concentration camp.

The plan was to help promote {{the overthrow of the}} Nazi regime and end the war by concentrating on large Hamburg companies. Through extensive contacts, they were able to build a conspiratorial network in over 30 firms, primarily in the Hamburg shipyards. Their declared goals were to mobilize the workers, support the foreign forced laborers and the Soviet prisoners of war and to sabotage the weapons production. The group consisted of Communist Party members, some Social Democrats, independents and foreign forced laborers. The group promoted a socialist Germany allied with the Soviet Union, using leaflets that were, as a rule, distributed internally. Through Wilhelm Guddorf, they had contacts outside Hamburg, with the Rote Kapelle in Berlin and Leo Drabent and Hermann Böse in Bremen.|$|E
25|$|The Australians {{moved on}} to Bath to take on Somerset, and the weather finally began to look favourable. Australia won the toss and decided to bat on a decent batting wicket. Rick McCosker went cheaply and was soon {{followed}} by Craig Serjeant, but captain Greg Chappell {{looked to be in}} commanding touch. He set <b>about</b> <b>building</b> <b>a</b> strong partnership with Gary Cosier, which saw the tourists pass 150 for 2. Soon after though, Cosier misread a straight one on off-stump from West Indian paceman Joel Garner, and was clean-bowled for 44. Doug Walters made a useful but disappointing 23, but David Hookes and Rod Marsh both failed with 3 apiece. Kerry O'Keeffe added a useful 11 to help see Australia past 200, but a collapsing tail saw Australia all out for 232 off 67.3 overs, with Chappell top-scorer with 113. The Australian captain hit three 6s in his innings, including one into the nearby River Avon. Garner finished with 4 for 66, but local medium-pacer Graham Burgess was the pick of the bowlers with 5 for 25.|$|E
