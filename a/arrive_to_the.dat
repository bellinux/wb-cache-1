25|$|Through {{the rest}} of the month 5th Tank Army would spar along the Chir River line with scratch forces of Romanian and German rear-area {{security}} troops plus the arriving elements of Army Detachment Hollidt. On the 25th, the 346th received orders to leave its second-echelon regiment and reserves in the Medvezhyi and Malaia Donshchinka regions and march southward to Petrovo and Kalach Kurtlak in the Kurtlak River valley. There, it was to relieve 47th Guards Rifle Division's regiments at and south of Chernyshevskaia and assist and then relieve 112th Cavalry Division in its bridgehead west of Osinovskii. The following day, the cavalry expanded its bridgehead and there was a chance that Chernyshevskaia could be enveloped if 50th Guards could <b>arrive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and the 346th <b>arrive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south of the village quickly enough. In the event, no envelopment took place, but the 50th captured the village from 22nd Panzer in a frontal attack, while the 346th made gains to the south on November 27, although the village was lost again the same day. It appears that the division's full forces did not advance {{all the way to the}} river, which may have been due to the command changing hands.|$|E

25|$|Nest {{activity}} is episodic and occurs in bursts rather than continuous activity throughout the day. Polistes instabilis spends {{roughly half of}} the daylight hours inactive and immobile. Periods of inactivity are broken when individuals initiate actions such as arriving, leaving, walking, antennating, gaster wagging, or fanning. These actions cause other workers to also begin working. 80% of {{activity is}} initiated by arriving or walking. Arriving triggers activity because when wasps <b>arrive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nest they bring materials to transfer to other workers. Walking {{is a first step}} taken in assessing needs of the colony, which can then be communicated to others. Queens do not differ from other workers in the initiation of active periods.|$|E
25|$|Out of a {{regard for}} discipline, Bordiga and his comrades (who {{became known as}} the 'Italian Communist Left') {{accepted}} the Comintern decision but were in an increasingly difficult position. When Bordiga was arrested in February 1923 on a trumped-up charge by the new government of Benito Mussolini, he had to give up his post as member of the Central Committee of the PCd’I but, on his acquittal later that year, he decided not to reclaim it, thus implicitly accepting that he was now an oppositionist. In 1924, the Left lost control of the PCd’I to a pro-Moscow group whose leader, Gramsci, became the Party's General Secretary in June. At the third Congress of PCd’I, held in exile in Lyons in January 1926, the manoeuvre of the pro-Moscow group was completed; without the support of the International Communist to escape from fascist control, few members of the Left were able to <b>arrive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Congress, so the 'theses' drawn up by Bordiga were rejected and those of the Stalinist minority group accepted.|$|E
