40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{effort has been}} made to design a {{methodology}} for the determination of probability of selection for the cases where more than one measure of sizes are involved, {{especially in the case of}} <b>agricultural</b> sample <b>surveys.</b> So far no effort has been made for the cases of this sort in the literature of unequal probability sampling / probability proportional to size sampling. In this paper, a method has been developed to merge two measures of sizes in to one, which has combined proportional affect of both measures of sizes. The method is also valid for two measures of sizes having different units of measurements. It is also an unprecedented effort.

40|$|Increasing nonresponse {{rates in}} federal surveys and {{potentially}} biased survey estimates are a growing concern, {{especially with regard}} to establishment surveys. Unlike household surveys, not all establishments contribute equally to survey estimates. With regard to <b>agricultural</b> <b>surveys,</b> if an extremely large farm fails to complete a survey, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) could potentially underestimate average acres operated among other things. In order to identify likely nonrespondents prior to data collection, the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) began modeling nonresponse using Census of Agriculture data and prior <b>Agricultural</b> Resource Management <b>Survey</b> (ARMS) response history.
