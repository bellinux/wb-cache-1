In Germany, the legions in mutiny {{were those of}} the Lower Rhine under Aulus Caecina (the V Alaudae, XXI Rapax, I Germanica, <b>and</b> <b>XX</b> Valeria Victrix). The army of the Lower Rhine was {{stationed}} in summer quarters {{on the border of}} the Ubii. They had not gotten the bonuses promised them by Augustus, and when it became clear a response from Tiberius was not forthcoming, they revolted. Germanicus dealt with the troops in Germania, and Tiberius' son Drusus dealt with Illyricum.|$|E
5|$|Near Decatur, Brig. Gen. John W. Sprague, {{in command}} of the 2nd Brigade, 4th Division of the XVI Corps, was {{attacked}} by Wheeler's cavalry. Wheeler had taken the Fayetteville Road, while Hardee's column took the Flat Shoals Road toward McPherson's position. The Federals fled the town in a stampede, but managed to save the ordnance and supply trains of the XV, XVI, XVII, <b>and</b> <b>XX</b> corps. With the failure of Hardee's assault, Wheeler was in no position to hold Decatur, and fell back to Atlanta that night. Sprague was later awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions.|$|E

25|$|Claudius {{appointed}} Plautius to {{lead his}} invasion of Britannia in 43, in support of Verica, king of the Atrebates and an ally of Rome, who had been deposed by his eastern neighbours the Catuvellauni.

In this occasion, II Augusta was commanded by the future emperor Vespasian.

25|$|From the league's {{inception}} through ArenaBowl XVIII, {{the championship}} game was played {{at the home of}} the highest-seeded remaining team.

This was the first professional sports championship to be staged in the city since Hurricane Katrina struck in August 2005. ArenaBowl XXI in New Orleans was deemed a success, and the city was chosen to host ArenaBowl XXII. In 2010, the location returned to being decided by which of the two participating teams was seeded higher. ArenaBowl XXV (2012) returned to a neutral site and was once again played in New Orleans.

25|$|On 1 July 1916, the German first {{defensive}} position ran {{south of}} the village, along the lower slopes of Montauban Spur. The junction of the British Fourth Army <b>and</b> <b>XX</b> Corps of the French Sixth Army ran through Maricourt and {{to the east of}} Montauban. The 30th Division of XIII Corps held the right of the corps area, next to the French 39th Division, which formed the northernmost division of the Sixth Army. Signs of an offensive by the British and French had been seen in May 1916 but German military intelligence anticipated an offensive against the Fricourt and Gommecourt spurs, with a possible supporting attack in between, rather than an attack further south around Montauban and the Somme river. The 30th Division attacked behind a creeping barrage and captured its objectives of Montauban and the Montauban Ridge, inflicting many casualties on Bavarian Infantry Regiment 6, of the 10th Bavarian Division and Infantry Regiment 62 of the 12th Division.|$|E

25|$|Joseph Joffre, who {{had been}} Commander-in-Chief of the French army since 1911 and the Minister of War, Adolphe Messimy met on 1 August, {{to agree that the}} {{military}} conduct of the war should exclusively be the responsibility of the Commander-in-Chief. On 2 August, as small parties of German soldiers crossed the French border, Messimy told Joffre that he had the freedom to order French troops across the German but not the Belgian frontier. Joffre sent warning orders to the covering forces near the frontier, requiring the VII Corps to prepare to advance towards Mühlhausen (French: Mulhouse) to the north-east of Belfort <b>and</b> <b>XX</b> Corps to make ready to begin an offensive towards Nancy. As soon as news arrived that German troops had entered Luxembourg, the Fourth Army was ordered to move between the Third and Fifth armies, ready to attack to the north of Verdun. Operations into Belgium were forbidden, to deny the Germans a pretext until 4 August, when it was certain that German troops had already violated the Belgian border. To comply with the Franco-Russian Alliance, Joffre ordered an invasion of Alsace-Lorraine on for 14 August, although anticipating a German offensive through Belgium.|$|E
25|$|On 18 September, the Sixth Army advance {{was stopped}} on a {{south-east}} to north-west line at Carlepont {{on the south}} bank of the Oise and Noyon on the north bank, which ended the first French outflanking move.

The Second Army prepared to advance on 22 September, on a line from Lassigny northwards to Roye and Chaulnes, around the German flank. Next day, the German II Corps joined the right flank of the 1st Army, for an attack to the south-west with the IV Corps, IX Reserve Corps and the 4th and 7th cavalry divisions. Bülow, ordered Kluck to cancel the offensive and withdraw the two corps behind the right flank of the 1st Army. On 16 September, the 2nd and 9th Cavalry divisions were dispatched from the Aisne front as reinforcements but before the retirement began, the French XIII and IV corps on the left flank of Sixth Army, with the 61st and 62nd divisions of the 6th Group of Reserve Divisions, began to advance along the Oise and met the right flank of the 1st Army between Carlepont and Noyon on 17 September. On the right flank, the French 17th and 45th divisions attacked near Soissons and gained a foothold on the plateau of Cuffies, just north of the city.|$|E
500|$|A {{period of}} {{stalemate}} followed, {{during which time}} the regiment, {{along with the rest}} of the brigade, rotated between the forward position at Fara and other positions in support and reserve at Kukhari and Marakeb as preparations were made for a future offensive. The regiment's next major action came in October 1917. Conceived as part of an attack towards the Jerusalem to Jaffa line, the regiment took part in the Battle of Beersheba. During this battle, along with the 4th Light Horse Regiment, the 12th Light Horse carried out a successful mounted charge, advancing over open ground late in the afternoon to get under the Ottoman guns and capture the town and its vital water supplies. Late in the afternoon, the 12th Light Horse Regiment advanced, according to historian Henry Gullett, on a [...] "squadron frontage in three lines" [...] apart, with the 4th Light Horse Regiment to launch a [...] "pure cavalry" [...] charge, the troopers advancing with bayonets in their hands. Advancing over , the light horsemen were subjected to rifle and machine-gun fire and artillery bombardment from the flanks and trenches to their front. Supporting artillery helped suppress the machine-gun fire from the flanks, and the speed of the charge made it difficult for the Ottoman gunners to adjust their range. The Ottoman trenches were not protected with wire and after jumping over the trenches, the light horsemen dismounted and hand-to-hand fighting followed. While most of the 4th Light Horse and some of the 12th Light Horse dismounted, the remainder stayed mounted, continuing their charge into the town. The British official historian claims [...] "more than half the dismounted troops in the town were captured or killed," [...] while 15 of the 28 guns in the town were captured by the Desert Mounted Corps <b>and</b> <b>XX</b> Corps. Over 700 Ottoman soldiers were captured and, more significantly for the Australians, over 400,000 litres of water secured. In achieving this, the 12th lost 24 men killed and 15 wounded; 44 horses were also killed, while another 60 were wounded or became sick.|$|E
