2500|$|Many anecdotes of Diogenes {{refer to}} his dog-like behavior, and his praise of a dog's virtues. It {{is not known}} whether Diogenes was insulted with the epithet [...] "doggish" [...] and made a virtue of it, or whether he first took up the dog theme himself. When asked why he was called a dog he replied, [...] "I fawn on those who give me anything, I yelp at those who refuse, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>set</b> my teeth in rascals." [...] Diogenes {{believed}} human beings live artificially and hypocritically and {{would do well to}} study the dog. Besides performing natural body functions in public with ease, a dog will eat anything, and make no fuss about where to sleep. Dogs live in the present without anxiety, and have no use for the pretensions of abstract philosophy. In addition to these virtues, dogs are thought to know instinctively who is friend and who is foe. Unlike human beings who either dupe others or are duped, dogs will give an honest bark at the truth. Diogenes stated that [...] "other dogs bite their enemies, I bite my friends to save them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dench {{returned}} to the West End in mid-2009, playing Madame de Montreuil in Yukio Mishima's play Madame de Sade, directed by Michael Grandage {{as part of the}} Donmar season at Wyndham's Theatre. The same year, she appeared in Sally Potter's experimental film Rage, a project that featured 14 actors playing fictional figures in and around the fashion world, giving monologues before a plain backdrop. Attracted {{to the fact that it}} was unlike anything she had done before, Dench welcomed the opportunity to work with Potter. [...] "I like to do something that's not expected, or predictable. I had to learn to smoke a joint, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>set</b> my trousers alight," [...] she said about filming. Her next film was Rob Marshall's musical film Nine, based on Arthur Kopit's book for the 1982 musical of the same name, itself suggested by Federico Fellini's semi-autobiographical film 8½. Also starring Daniel Day-Lewis, Marion Cotillard, Penélope Cruz, and Sophia Loren, she played Lilli La Fleur, an eccentric but motherly French costume designer, who performs the song [...] "Folies Bergères" [...] in the film. Despite mixed to negative reviews, Nine was nominated for four Academy Awards, and awarded both the Satellite Award for Best Film and Best Cast.|$|E
