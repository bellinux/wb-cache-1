5|$|In 1945, Polish Eastern Borderlands were annexed into Soviet Ukraine and the family, {{like many}} other Poles, was resettled to Kraków, where Lem, at his father's insistence, took up medical studies at the Jagiellonian University.

5|$|During the game's development, Harmonix {{only used}} low-fidelity {{versions}} of the remasters, which were sufficient for programming and note charting; Apple Corps feared that the leak of any high-fidelity remastered track from Abbey Road studios {{would lead to the}} unauthorized use of samples of the Beatles' music in remixes. High-fidelity {{versions of the}} songs were not implemented until the final publishing of the game. Harmonix performed very little additional remixing upon receipt of these remasters; in some cases, three different guitar parts—lead, solo, and rhythm—were brought into a single cohesive guitar part, slightly raising the volume of the specific guitar track that was used in note tracking {{to make it easier for}} the player to follow in the game. The ability for up to three players to sing vocal harmonies, a feature not present in previous Rock Band games, was designed and implemented as an optional feature so <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> overwhelming to players.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Palestinian historiography and {{collective}} memory {{point out that}} during the exodus of Palestinian Arab population of the 1948 War the massacres and forced expulsions that happened {{could be seen as}} ethnic cleansing. In the Latrun zone, this affected about 20 villages and ten thousand Palestinian Arabs. Some inhabitants fled during the fights of April but most fled when the Israelis attacked their village during the following operations. After capturing a village, the Israeli soldiers systematically expelled the non-combatants, intimidating them to leave and demolishing houses. A massacre of between thirty and seventy Arabs took place some days after Abu Shusha was taken. Most villages were levelled, so <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used by the Arab volunteers and to prevent the inhabitants returning. In some cases Jewish settlements were established on village land.|$|E

With the detainees loaded on trucks, the ground convoy force attempted to reach the first crash site. Unable to find it amongst the narrow, winding alleyways, the convoy came under devastating small arms and RPG fire. The convoy {{had to return to}} base after suffering numerous casualties, and sustaining substantial damage to their vehicles.|$|E

5|$|The real-life {{surprise}} of the actors gave the scene an intense sense of realism and made {{it one of the}} film's most memorable moments. During preview screenings the crew noticed that some viewers would move towards the back of the theater so <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> too close to the screen during the sequence. The scene has frequently been called {{one of the most memorable}} moments in cinema history. In 2007, Empire magazine named it as the greatest 18-rated moment in film, ranking it above the decapitation scene in The Omen (1976) and the transformation sequence in An American Werewolf in London (1981).|$|E
5|$|Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the mid-16th century, Henry VIII {{sold it to}} Sir William Sharington for £783, who {{demolished}} {{the abbey}} church and converted the abbey into a house, starting work in about 1539. So <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> incommoded by villagers passing close to his residence, {{he is said to}} have sold the church bells and used the proceeds to erect a bridge over the River Ray for their convenience. Few other alterations were made to the monastic buildings themselves: the cloisters, for example, still stand below the living accommodation. About 1550, Sir William added an octagonal tower containing two small chambers, one above the other; the lower one was reached through the main rooms, and was for storing and viewing his treasures; the upper one, for banqueting, was only accessible by walking across the leads of the roof. In each chamber is a central octagonal stone table, carved with up-to-date Renaissance ornament. A mid-16th century stone conduit house stands over the spring from which water was conducted to the house. Further additions were made over the centuries, and the house now has various grand reception rooms.|$|E
5|$|The moat was {{situated}} {{at a distance}} of about 20m from the outer wall. The moat itself was over 20m wide and as much as 10m deep, featuring a 1.5m tall crenellated wall on the inner side, serving as a first line of defence. Transverse walls cross the moat, tapering towards the top so <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used as bridges. Some of them have been shown to contain pipes carrying water into the city from the hill country to the city's north and west. Their role has therefore been interpreted as that of aqueducts for filling the moat and as dams dividing it into compartments and allowing the water to be retained {{over the course of the}} walls. According to Alexander van Millingen, however, there is little direct evidence in the accounts of the city's sieges to suggest that the moat was ever actually flooded. In the sections north of the Gate of St. Romanus, the steepness of the slopes of the Lycus valley made the construction maintenance of the moat problematic; it is probable therefore that the moat ended at the Gate of St. Romanus, and did not resume until after the Gate of Adrianople.|$|E
