5|$|The fusion rate in {{the core}} is in a self-correcting equilibrium: <b>a</b> <b>{{slightly}}</b> higher rate of fusion would cause the core to heat up more and expand slightly against {{the weight of the}} outer layers, reducing the density and hence the fusion rate and correcting the perturbation; and <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> lower rate would cause the core to cool and shrink slightly, increasing the density and increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present rate.|$|E

5|$|A {{different}} {{version of}} In the Lounge was also created. This includes the same 9 original tracks, although in <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> different order. It {{does not include}} the two indie songs; however, it does feature Rich Ragsdale's NOLF title theme, as well as remixes of 6 of the original songs, by Gabriel Mann.|$|E
5|$|A second, more {{traditional}} design followed {{for the initial}} batch of five unstreamlined locomotives (Nos. 6230–6234). Again they were of welded tank construction, but lacked any of the streamlining add-ons. Even without the streamlining Type 'B' tenders were distinguishable from Type 'A' by having <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> different profile at the front and steps and handrails at the rear.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>slightly</b> {{different}} {{version of}} the short story was featured in the November 1991 issue of Omni. The OMNI version concerns an unnamed girl and an old man named Skinner who live in the one-room shack built on top of the first cable tower of the Bridge. This version was collected in Gardner Dozois' 1992 anthology , and in Larry McCaffery's After Yesterday's Crash (1995).|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>slightly</b> later route {{along the}} {{parallel}} was a wagon road, built between 1857 and 1860, that involved experimental use of camels as transport. In the late 19thcentury, settlers and private stagecoach companies followed similar east–west routes. Homesteaders who {{stayed in the}} area developed cattle ranches on the grasslands, and cattle grazed in the Petrified Forest until the mid-20thcentury.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>slightly</b> variant way of {{executing}} {{people by}} means of impalement was to force an iron meat hook beneath a person's ribs and hang him up to die slowly. This technique was in 18th century Ottoman-controlled Bosnia called the cengela, but the practice is also attested, for example, in 1770s Dutch Suriname as a punishment meted out to rebellious slaves.|$|E

5|$|Assuming less {{load and}} rolling friction, Raepsaet, in contrast, calculates a maximum pulling force of 27kN, {{which would have}} needed <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> smaller towing crew. Under these circumstances, the use of {{harnessed}} oxen—which has been refuted by Tolley {{on the basis of}} their relatively diminished pulling capabilities— would have become feasible. However, the necessary expenditure of energy at the Diolkos must be regarded in both scenarios as considerable.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{teachers}} use minus and plus symbols as grade modifiers. For example, [...] "−5" [...] denotes <b>a</b> grade <b>slightly</b> lower than [...] "excellent", while [...] "+4" [...] denotes <b>a</b> grade <b>slightly</b> higher than [...] "very good". Half-grades such as [...] "4/5" [...] are also used. However, these modifiers are unofficial {{and do not}} appear in final grade reports.|$|R

5|$|Coat: The Labrador Retriever's coat {{should be}} short and dense, but not wiry. The coat is water-resistant, so the dog {{does not get}} cold when taking to water in the winter.

5|$|Galaxies come {{in three}} main types: ellipticals, spirals, and irregulars. <b>A</b> <b>slightly</b> more {{extensive}} description of galaxy types {{based on their}} appearance is given by the Hubble sequence.
