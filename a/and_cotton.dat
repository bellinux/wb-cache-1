Flax and polyester has been a popular blend now-a-days and depicts excellent properties than their individual yarn properties. Different proportion of flax and polyester has been tested to observe the yarn properties and it is found that polyester was perfectly fits with low proportion of flax. Their blends with specific ratios exhibit excellent properties which hence ultimately contribute to the fabric properties...|$|R

40|$|Aims Our {{principal}} {{aim was to}} test the hypothesis that pima <b>cotton</b> (Gossypium barbadense) <b>and</b> upland <b>cotton</b> (G. hirsutum) have different photoinhibition and photoprotection strategies due to differences in light capturing and photosynthetic characteristics. Methods We measured diurnal leaf movement, incident photon flux density (PFD) on leaves, leaf temperature, maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm), PSII photochemical efficiency (ΦPSII), electron transport rate (ETR), photochemical quenching coefficient (qP), non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs) and photorespiration (Pr) in pima <b>and</b> upland <b>cotton.</b> Important findings Upland cotton had higher Pn and Gs than pima cotton. Nevertheless, the ratio of photorespiration rate to gross photosynthetic rate was generally higher in pima <b>cotton.</b> Pima <b>cotton</b> <b>and</b> upland <b>cotton</b> had similar degrees of photoinhibition. Furthermore, pima cotton had generally higher thermal energy dissipation capacity than upland cotton. All results indicated that differences in leaf diaheliotropic movement and Gs in pima <b>cotton</b> <b>and</b> upland <b>cotton</b> resulted in differences of both incident PFD on leaves and leaf temperature. Upland <b>cotton</b> <b>and</b> pima <b>cotton</b> preferentially used electron transport flux and thermal energy dissipation, respectively, for light energy dissipation toward photoprotection to against photoinhibition. Nevertheless, more electron transport flux was distributed into the photorespiration pathway to prevent over-reduction of the photosynthetic electrontransport chain and photoinhibition in pima cotton...|$|R

The experiment was carried out in a strip plot design with four replications. The vertical plots were occupied with three sowing dates. The horizontal plots were assigned to three ridge width. Sowing on 15 th March significantly affected (p< 0. 05) number of days to first flower opening and plant height of sole <b>and</b> relay intercropping <b>cotton</b> <b>and</b> number of fruiting branches/plant, number of opened bolls/plant, boll weight, seed cotton yield per plant and feddan <b>and</b> lint <b>cotton</b> yield/fed of sole <b>cotton</b> <b>and</b> resulted in the highest values in both seasons. Sowing relay intercropping cotton on 1 st April significantly affected (p< 0. 05) number of fruiting branches/plant, number of opened bolls/plant, boll weight, seed cotton yield per plant and feddan <b>and</b> lint <b>cotton</b> yield/fed <b>and</b> produced the highest values in both seasons. Sowing sole or relay intercropping cotton on wide ridges significantly affected all studied traits and produced the highest values in both seasons. It can be concluded that, in order to maximize seeds <b>and</b> lint <b>cotton</b> yields/fed of sole cotton, it must be sown in 15 th March on ridges with width of 100 cm.

5|$|Agriculture was the empire's {{main source}} of income through taxes on land and produce.

The living conditions of the labourers who farmed the land must have been bearable as there are no records of revolts by the landless against wealthy landlords.
