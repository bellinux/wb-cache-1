5|$|After {{settling}} {{down at the}} landlady's house, Vanaja gets invited {{to play a game}} of ashta chamma (a leisurely game in rural towns of Andhra Pradesh) against the landlady.

Vanaja excels at these art forms and seems to be on a steadily ascending path until the arrival of Shekhar (Karan Singh), the landlady's 23-year-old son, from the United States. Shekhar is a handsome, muscular young man who is running for <b>an</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> local government.

5|$|After visiting England in July 1936, Thomas Finucane, then {{a company}} director, decided {{to set up}} <b>an</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West End of London on Regent Street. In November 1936, {{the family moved to}} England {{permanently}} and bought a house at 26 Castle Gate Road, Richmond in the London suburbs. Brendan was sent to Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School. Brendan completed his schooling with good qualifications. He started in an office job as an accountant which he loathed. In 1937, the RAF began offering short-service commissions (SSC) to lower-class persons who met the academic standard. It offered a four-year term as a junior rank on squadron service with flying lessons. A further six years would be spent on the reserve list. In November 1937, Brendan approached his father about joining the British Armed Forces. Despite his Republican past, the senior Finucane agreed believing a military career would provide him a sense of direction lacking in his own youth. His parents cashed in their insurance policies, even though they needed the money and Thomas Andrew Finucane had been made unemployed.|$|E
