5|$|Age of Empires III {{builds on}} and {{introduces}} new features to the Age of Mythology engine, called Bang! Engine. One new {{feature is the}} inclusion of the Havok physics simulation middleware engine on the Windows version and the similar PhysX engine on Mac OS X. This means that many events such <b>as</b> <b>building</b> destruction and tree falls will not be pre-created animations, but will be calculated according to the physics engine, in an innovation for the series. Other graphical features of the game include bloom lighting and support for pixel shader 3.0.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the forests}} of the {{watershed}} were not significantly affected, but after logging operations sprung up near {{the start of the}} 20th century, most of the virgin timber in the watershed was cleared. The first sawmills were built to provide lumber for local uses, such <b>as</b> <b>building</b> houses and barns. Soon, however, the Washington, Idaho and Montana Railway extended its tracks into the area, allowing lumber to be exported out of the basin. Logging {{turned out to be a}} very profitable industry but had a lasting negative effect on the ecology of the Potlatch River watershed.|$|E

5|$|Avoiding overdecoration, {{these artists}} left uncarved spaces where required, {{although}} their elaborate doorjambs are exhibitionistic. Here, {{on the outer}} walls, the sculptures are not overdone, yet they are articulate and discreetly aesthetic. The Hoysala builders used soapstone almost universally <b>as</b> <b>building</b> material, a trend that started {{in the middle of}} the 11th century with Chalukyan temples. Other common artistic features between the two Kanarese dynasties are the ornate Salabhanjika (pillar bracket figures), the lathe-turned pillars and the makara torana (lintel with mythical beastly figure). The tower over the shrine in a Hoysala temple is a closely moulded form of the Chalukya style tower.|$|E
5|$|However, {{certain areas}} of the country like Batanes have slight {{differences}} as both Spanish and Filipino ways of architecture assimilated differently due to the climate. Limestones and coral were used <b>as</b> <b>building</b> materials. Idjangs or Ivatan castles were the primary shelter of the people prior to the Spanish conquest of the whole Philippines.|$|E
5|$|Like most {{strategic}} bombing during World War II, {{the aim of}} the USAAF {{offensive against}} Japan was to destroy the enemy's war industries, kill or disable civilian employees of these industries, and undermine civilian morale.

5|$|Mount Pleasant Road was {{constructed}} {{over the course}} of several years by interconnecting several existing streets as well <b>as</b> <b>building</b> a new road in other places; at that time, a road existed to the north and south of the cemetery. The road to the south, running between Clarence Street (renamed Heath Street on April 7, 1913) and Moore Avenue, was known as Lyle Street and Kinsman Avenue. The road to the north, running between Balliol Street and Merton Street, was known as Alberta Avenue.|$|E

5|$|The Chester Archaeological Society, {{founded in}} 1849, {{acquired}} artefacts discovered in Chester and undertook excavations where possible; the Grosvenor Museum was opened in 1886 {{to allow the}} public to view the society's collection. The society continued to work in Chester, recording information on the fortress and its surrounding settlement, often <b>as</b> <b>building</b> works destroyed the sites. Between 1962 and 1999, about 50excavations were carried out {{in and around the}} fortress, revealing new information about Deva Victrix. Between 2007 and 2009, excavations were carried out at the amphitheatre on behalf of Chester City Council and in association with English Heritage.|$|E
5|$|The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority {{was created}} {{after the storm}} to manage the area's {{floodplains}} and rivers, such <b>as</b> <b>building</b> dams. The heavily flooded areas were expropriated and barred from rebuilding homes, {{and most of the}} land was later converted into an extensive park system along Toronto's rivers. A footbridge dedicated to the victims crosses the Humber river in Raymore Park, which was the former Raymore Drive.|$|E
5|$|The {{civil parish}} councils were governed by Ely Rural District council from 1894 until 1974. East Cambridgeshire District Council (ECDC) {{was formed in}} 1974 with {{administration}} buildings in Ely. The district council collects council tax, provides services such <b>as</b> <b>building</b> regulations and local planning, leisure and tourism, handles issues strategic to the district, and many other services. ECDC is in turn governed by Cambridgeshire County Council which has administration buildings in Cambridge. The county council provides county-wide services such as major road infrastructure, fire and rescue, libraries and heritage, and strategic planning. A mobile library visits the village every fortnight.|$|E

5|$|The {{planning}} {{of the metro}} was spurred {{by the development of}} the Ørestad area of Copenhagen. The principle of building a rail transit was passed by the Parliament of Denmark on 24 June 1992, with the Ørestad Act. The responsibility for developing the area, as well <b>as</b> <b>building</b> and operating the metro, was given to the Ørestad Development Corporation, a joint venture between Copenhagen Municipality (45%) and the Ministry of Finance (55%). Initially, three modes were considered: a tramway, a light rail and a rapid transit. In October 1994, the Development Corporation chose a light rapid transit.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{site was}} found at 1601 W. First Street that had originally been constructed to house the Bonebrake Seminary. It was a three-story brick building built in 1879, and owned by the Dayton Board of Education, which {{used it as a}} warehouse. Monsanto leased the site on 15 October 1943, and began converting it into a laboratory known as Unit III. New heating and lighting were installed, windows were replaced, new flooring was laid, and some rooms were re-plastered. A pair of guard houses known as buildings J and K were added, as was a chemical storage shed known <b>as</b> <b>building</b> F, and a wire fence. Laboratory activities were transferred there from Unit I on 25 September. In May 1945, five additional temporary buildings were constructed on land leased from the Board of Education that housed offices, a cafeteria, locker rooms, a physics laboratory and a laundry. A new guardhouse was also built. To this was added two portable buildings in 1946.|$|E
5|$|At , it {{is a small}} honeyeater with a short {{tail and}} {{relatively}} long down-curved bill. It is sexually dimorphic; the male has a glossy red head and brown upperparts and paler grey-brown underparts while the female has predominantly grey-brown plumage. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical mangrove forests. It is very active when feeding in the tree canopy, darting from flower to flower and gleaning insects off foliage. It calls constantly as it feeds. While little has been documented on the red-headed myzomela's breeding behaviour, it is recorded <b>as</b> <b>building</b> a small cup-shaped nest in the mangroves and laying two or three oval, white eggs with small red blotches.|$|E

5|$|Banished {{revolves}} around the player guiding citizens of a remote community of outcasts to grow and maintain a settlement through a command economy. The game focuses on the player's town as a whole, with {{the citizens of the}} town acting as a resource to be managed. The player must assign citizens to various jobs such <b>as</b> <b>building</b> or fishing. The citizens then perform the job without specific direction from the player. Citizens have needs that must be met in order to keep them happy and healthy, such as ensuring enough food is available or that they have a home. Additional citizens come from two sources, the birth of children and the arrival of nomads, wandering groups that wish to join the player's town. The player's citizens will age and eventually die.|$|E
5|$|Four storms struck Madagascar in {{the season}} between December and March, collectively killing 100people and causing $250million (1982 United States dollars) in damage. The storms caused {{widespread}} flooding and a state of disaster for four months, compounded by floods in January. About 180,000people were forced to evacuate, and there were increased levels of flood-related diseases. The storms closed down many roads and destroyed widespread crops, forcing the government to import 400,000 metric tons of rice. After the floods, workers repaired damaged roads and dykes while the government provided relief supplies. However, the ongoing floods strained the Madagascar's resources, and the government appealed for aid {{to the international community}} on February4. The United States Agency for International Development provided nearly $9million in aid, mostly for rice and rebuilding roads. Other countries donated about $7.5million in money or relief goods, such <b>as</b> <b>building</b> materials, food, clothing, and medicine.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{substantially}} more reactive P(III) derivatives of nucleosides, 3'-O-chlorophosphites, were successfully {{used for the}} formation of internucleosidic linkages. This led to the discovery of the phosphite triester methodology. The group led by M. Caruthers took the advantage of less aggressive and more selective 1H-tetrazolidophosphites and implemented the method on solid phase. Very shortly after, the workers from the same group further improved the method by using more stable nucleoside phosphoramidites <b>as</b> <b>building</b> blocks. The use of 2-cyanoethyl phosphite-protecting group in place of a less user-friendly methyl group led to the nucleoside phosphoramidites currently used in oligonucleotide synthesis (see Phosphoramidite building blocks below). Many later improvements to the manufacturing of building blocks, oligonucleotide synthesizers, and synthetic protocols made the phosphoramidite chemistry a very reliable and expedient method of choice for the preparation of synthetic oligonucleotides.|$|E
