500|$|Harrison acted quite {{independently}} {{in selecting}} his cabinet, {{much to the}} dismay of the Republican bosses. He began by delaying the presumed nomination of James G. Blaine as Secretary of State so as to preclude Blaine's involvement {{in the formation of the}} administration, as had occurred in President Garfield's term. In fact, other than Blaine, the only Republican boss initially nominated was Redfield Proctor, as Secretary of War. Senator Shelby Cullom's comment symbolizes Harrison's steadfast aversion to use federal positions for patronage: [...] "I suppose Harrison treated me as well as he did any other Senator; but whenever he did <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> it was done so ungraciously that the concession tended to anger rather than please." [...] Harrison's selections shared particular alliances – such as their service in the Civil War, Indiana citizenship and membership in the Presbyterian Church. Nevertheless, Harrison with these choices had alienated pivotal Republican operatives from New York to Pennsylvania to Iowa and prematurely compromised his political power and future. Harrison's normal schedule provided for two full cabinet meetings per week, as well as separate weekly one-on-one meetings with each cabinet member.|$|E
500|$|In October 2014, PewDiePie began {{hinting at}} the {{possibility}} that he might not renew his contract with Maker Studios upon its expiration in December 2014. Reports that covered this information also added that PewDiePie expressed his frustrations with the studio's parent company, Disney; PewDiePie was quoted saying, [...] "The fact that Disney bought Maker Studios doesn't really change <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> If I ask for help, they reply, but that's all the contact we have. We'll see what happens." [...] Rather than re-sign with Maker, PewDiePie has mulled the option of launching his own network, although he has declined to provide in-depth details on the subject. However, in light of news outlets reporting his disinterest with Maker, PewDiePie tweeted, [...] "I feel like I was misquoted in the WSJ and I'm really happy with the work that Maker has been doing for me." [...] PewDiePie ultimately continued creating videos under Maker; his relationship with the network has seen Maker establish an official PewDiePie website, app, and online store to sell Bro Army merchandise, while PewDiePie promotes Maker's media interests and gives the network a share of his YouTube ad revenue.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the loss}} of his IBO belt, Booth spent almost two years away from the ring as he {{struggled}} with an alcohol addiction. Speaking about the matter in 2010 Booth said [...] "I took time off boxing because I was too drunk...No manager would look at me and all the doors were shut. I'd go on these mad binges and spend loads of money." [...] After earning £10,000 in his fight with Damaen Kelly, Booth had spent the money on a combination of drink and drugs with the money disappearing within six weeks. Speaking about his addiction, Booth said that drink had always been a part of family life but the suicide of his sister Deana had hit him particularly hard. Booth said, [...] "It was too young to die. She was a funloving girl. I don’t know why she did it. She got run over when she was young. She’d had a tragic time. It mentally disturbed me." [...] Two weeks later, following the tragedy, Booth fought and beat the Bulgarian boxer Dimitar Alipiev whilst drunk, saying, [...] "I wanted to fight because I didn’t {{know what to do with}} myself after Deana died. I was drinking on the day of the fight. I was numb. I was in no pain. I just didn’t care. It was the only time in my life I didn’t care." [...] It was Booth's 12th professional contest. Booth said that he also fell into bad company: [...] "I was in parks and dosshouses. I was British champion but walking around with drunks and thinking they were mates. I’d get up, drink cider and top up during the day. Sometimes, I’d get a bottle of cheap vodka and walk around with it in my pocket." [...] Eventually Booth checked into an alcohol clinic and begun the process of getting clean: [...] "It frightened me and I wanted to stop, but it was only when my body rejected the drink that I found the courage. My stomach packed in. I was sicking blood every morning." [...] He began training once more with trainer Tony Harris and began to rebuild his boxing career despite occasionally relapsing into drink. Eventually he gave up drinking altogether, saying, [...] "I’m one of those who has to be abstinent, because one drink isn’t going to do <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> except start it all again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is there <b>anything</b> more <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to do?" [...] he asked, as Aunt Hannah {{came out}} of the house with the three-legged stool and the glistening tin pail.|$|R
6000|$|... "There isn't <b>anything</b> else <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to do, that I know of," [...] he declared, [...] "so long as {{you don't}} care for any one else. Tell me again, you are {{sure that there is}} no one?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never mind,' {{said the}} Sister, 'it {{is much better}} {{that she did not}} think about it. Now, my dear, don't! I won't have <b>anything</b> done <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> You don't know how we Sisters sleep on nothing when we do sleep.' ...|$|R
60|$|HYPATIA. Oh yes, {{if there}} had only been <b>{{anything}}</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to do, any place for me to go, anything I wanted to read.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not of an unforgiving temperament, {{even had}} you done <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to forgive: but I am {{not aware that}} you have." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{never will}} do <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> Checco. But I won't keep you; I respect {{the duties of}} hospitality. However, another day you must come.' ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{turned away}} from him, closing her eyes as not to see {{something}} dangerous. [...] "You mustn't give <b>anything</b> up <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I should feel it all the while and I should hate it. I'm {{not afraid of the}} truth, but you are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I didn't; but Chiltern {{was saying}} things that I didn't like." [...] Adelaide's face at once became very serious. [...] "Yes, {{a good deal}} of sugar, please. I don't care about toast, and <b>anything</b> does <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> He has gone to the kennels, has he?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was going}} to bid her deny me, but it came into my thoughts, that having been {{represented}} so much out of order, it would have looked very odd; besides, I knew the honest Quaker, though she would do <b>anything</b> else <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> would not lie <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> {{and it would have}} been hard to have desired it of her.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, there ain't. There's nothing wrong; and {{if there}} was, what's that to you? I shan't ask you to pay <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> I suppose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I understand. You asked {{just now}} {{if you could do}} <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> You can do me a great service--you can {{recommend}} me a trustworthy lawyer." ...|$|E
6000|$|BLUNTSCHLI. Finished. (Petkoff goes beside Sergius; looks curiously {{over his}} left {{shoulder}} as he signs; and says with childlike envy) Haven't you <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to sign? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{just stopped}} dead, and cursed myself {{for all the}} fools out of London. I had about as much chance of cutting back to the water as a turned turtle. I just screwed up my window again to leave my hands free, and waited for them. There wasn't <b>anything</b> else <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to do.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, not at all. It's {{all right}} now. I couldn't explain {{very well that}} I hadn't come to the city just {{to be in the}} city, but because I had to do {{something}} to help along at home. You didn't seem to understand that there wa'n't <b>anything</b> there <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to take hold of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's the mischief! Never mind. We'll {{see if we}} can't do something. And in the {{meantime}} don't make a stranger of <b>me.</b> <b>Anything</b> does <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> Lord bless you! {{if you were to}} see how I rough it sometimes! I can eat beans and bacon with any one; and what's more, I can go without 'em if I can't get 'em." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've been so bad, sir, that I don't think he'd {{speak to}} me, or notice me, or do <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> And {{he has got}} a wife, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|Borne stooped {{over and}} kissed her, {{and went to the}} door. He came back and asked, [...] "You don't think it was silly, or <b>anything,</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to get it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Appleby made a last effort, but {{his voice}} shook a little as he said, “This is not your business, Harper. You can’t do <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> Don’t be a fool!” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{say what}} would be good <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> mamma," [...] Gwendolen answered, impetuously. [...] "You don't know {{what would be}} good <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> You and my uncle must not {{contradict}} me and tell <b>me</b> <b>anything</b> is good <b>for</b> <b>me</b> when I feel it is not good." ...|$|R
6000|$|CRAVEN (making a note). 90, you say. After twelve. (He {{suddenly}} relapses into gloom.) By the bye, don't order <b>anything</b> special <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I'm {{not allowed}} wine--only Apollinaris. No meat either--only {{a scrap of}} fish occasionally. I'm to have a short life, but not a merry one. (Sighing.) Well, well. (Bracing himself up.) Now, Julia, it's {{time for us to}} be off. (Julia rises.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's clean looney," [...] Strothers summed up. [...] "Won't {{listen to}} reason. Says he'll serve the time out. He's been tankin' up too regular, I guess. His wheels are buzzin'. Here, he give <b>me</b> this note <b>for</b> you. Any {{time you want}} <b>anything</b> send <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> The boys'll all stand by Bill's wife. You belong to us, you know. How are you off for money?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "His income," [...] Jeanne said, [...] "scarcely matters, does it? If {{my money}} is ever to do <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> it {{should at least}} enable me to choose a husband for myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She never fixed <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I haven't got any {{life and}} I don't {{want to have}} any," [...] Francie veraciously pleaded. [...] "And I don't know who you're talking about either!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Capt. G. (Aside.) Give me patience! I {{wish she}} would go. (Aloud.) I assure you you can't do <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> Minnie, and I must really settle down to this. Where's my pouch? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well;--yes. I owe next to nothing, but I'll be hanged if I can get <b>anything</b> done <b>for</b> <b>me</b> {{without being}} dunned {{up to my}} very eyes. You know that chap of Neefit's? I'm blessed if he didn't ask me whether I meant to settle last year's bill, before he should send me home a couple of cords I ordered! Now I don't owe Neefit twenty pounds if all was told." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} that there is <b>anything</b> else <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to explain. I was {{determined}} to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear." ...|$|R
60|$|MURRAY (smiling). Oh--you--yes! (Then seriously.) I don't {{care for}} the atmosphere, though. (He waves his hand towards the {{partition}} looking out on the porch.) All those people in bed {{out there on the}} porch seem so sick. It's depressing. I can't do <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> them--and--it makes <b>me</b> feel so helpless.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, that's true. Well, you've {{got your}} wits about you now, Dunham," [...] cried Staniford, with illogical bitterness. [...] "Very probably," [...] he added, gloomily, [...] "she doesn't care <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> after all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why can't she care? I suppose I'm nothing much, but she's known me all her life, and {{she used}} to like me. There's something--I can't make out. Could you do <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> with her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Men are {{different}} from women, I suppose. I feel about him that whatever he might do I should forgive it. But then I feel, also, {{that he would never}} do <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to forgive." ...|$|E
6000|$|He met a look full of consternation, and of struggles between filial {{deference}} and {{the sense}} of injustice. All Louis allowed himself to say was, however, 'Surely, when I am her own nephew! when our poverty is a flagrant fact--she may be acquitted of <b>anything</b> but caring <b>for</b> <b>me</b> for--for my mother's sake.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Father," [...] she begged, softly, [...] "come to me. I {{can keep}} you, if you don't mind {{for a short}} time being poor. You shall have all my salary except just enough for my clothes, and <b>anything</b> will do <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to wear. I will try so hard to make you comfortable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{were the}} finest painter in the world, he wouldn't think <b>anything</b> of <b>me</b> <b>for</b> it, I'm afraid; but if I could show him handfuls of big cheques for bad {{pictures}} I had painted, he would respect me." ...|$|R
