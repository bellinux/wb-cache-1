50|$|Approximately 200 {{species of}} birds have been {{identified}} in the area as part of a natural resource study for the Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River. Migratory species include woodcock, Canada geese, redhead duck, ring-necked duck, canvasback duck, greater scaup and lesser scaup. Other waterfowl that occasionally nest in the area are the <b>American</b> <b>merganser,</b> green-winged teal, black duck, mallard duck and wood duck. In addition, rails and snipe sometimes nest in the area. A variety of hawks, including the goshawk, redtailed hawk, redshouldered hawk, and sparrow hawk, as well as eastern wild turkey and turkey buzzard, are found in Forestburgh and the surrounding area. Several species of owls, including the barn owl, screech owl and great horned owl, are known to make their home in the Town. The occasional golden eagle, peregrine falcon, and osprey are seen in the Town.|$|E
5000|$|The marsh is {{man-made}} and is home {{to great}} blue herons, mallards, Canada geese, ring-necked ducks, hooded <b>mergansers,</b> <b>American</b> wigeons, violet-green swallows and red-winged blackbirds.|$|R
50|$|Cowan Lake is {{surrounded}} by a deciduous forest of beech and maple trees. The combination of lake and forest makes the park a destination for birders, who can observe mallards, <b>American</b> wigeons, <b>mergansers,</b> great blue and green-backed herons, killdeer, eastern bluebirds, catbirds, and many other species of birds. The most common mammals at the park are groundhogs, skunks, raccoons, and opossums.|$|R
5000|$|Great Meadows Unit: This unit {{is located}} in Stratford, Connecticut. There are no nature trails at this time, however from the {{surrounding}} roadways, there are opportunities to see northern harriers, red-breasted <b>mergansers,</b> <b>American</b> black ducks, pied billed grebe, great blue herons, and numerous other bird species. This unit is at [...]|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the fish habitat, the Wood River valley supports a diverse population of nesting ducks, shorebirds, and migratory songbirds. These include wood ducks, mallards, cinnamon teal, Canadian geese, <b>mergansers,</b> <b>American</b> coots, common snipes, mourning doves, killdeer, great egrets, meadowlarks, and yellow warblers. The area also supports nesting populations of bald eagles, ospreys, and northern harriers.|$|R
50|$|Umbagog Lake is {{more than}} 7 mi in length and covers more than 7000 acre, making it the largest lake along the New Hampshire/Maine border. It has an average depth of only 15 ft. The Umbagog area, unique in its habitats, {{provides}} home to many different species. Situated at the southern range of the boreal forests and the northern range of the deciduous forests, the Umbagog area is a transition zone providing homes to species of both habitat types. A total of 229 bird species have been observed on the refuge, and 137 species are known to breed there. There are many species of songbirds, including 24 varieties of warblers. The abundance of fish in the lakes and rivers provide food for the local populations of osprey and bald eagles. Mink, river otter, muskrat, and beaver {{can be seen in}} the lakes and rivers, while black bear, bobcats, fishers, marten, white-tailed deer and a dense population of moose inhabit the uplands. The extensive wetlands and marshes provide ideal habitat for waterfowl, such as common <b>mergansers,</b> <b>American</b> black ducks, common goldeneye and common loons.|$|R
5|$|Over 300 {{species of}} birds have been sighted in the park {{including}} the calliope hummingbird, the smallest bird species in North America, as well as trumpeter swans, which is North America's largest waterfowl. In addition to trumpeter swans, another 30 species of waterfowl have been recorded including blue-winged teal, common <b>merganser,</b> <b>American</b> wigeon and the colorful but reclusive harlequin duck which is occasionally spotted in Cascade Canyon. Both bald and golden eagles and other birds of prey such as the osprey, red-tailed hawk, American kestrel and occasional sightings of peregrine falcon have been reported. Of the 14 species of owls reported, the most common is the great horned owl, though the boreal owl and great grey owl are also seen occasionally. A dozen species of woodpeckers have been reported, as have a similar number of species of warblers, plovers and gulls. The vocal and gregarious black-billed magpie frequents campgrounds while Steller's jay and Clark's nutcracker {{are found in the}} backcountry. The sage covered plains of Jackson Hole are favored areas for sage grouse, Brewer's sparrow and sage thrashers, while the wetlands are frequented by great blue heron, American white pelican, sandhill crane and on rare occasions it's endangered relative, the whooping crane.|$|R
5000|$|Of {{the larger}} mammals {{the most common}} are elk, which exist in the thousands. [...] Their {{migration}} route between the National Elk Refuge and Yellowstone National Park is through Grand Teton National Park, so while easily seen anytime of the year, they are most numerous {{in the spring and}} fall. Other ungulates include bison and pronghorn—the fastest land mammal in the western hemisphere—which are found throughout Jackson Hole as are moose, which tend to stay near waterways and wetlands. Between 100-125 bighorn sheep dwell in the alpine and rocky zones of the peaks.Over 300 species of birds have been sighted in the park including the calliope hummingbird, the smallest bird species in North America, as well as trumpeter swans, which is North America's largest waterfowl.

It is also the only subspecies of cutthroat trout that is exclusively native to large streams and rivers. Various researchers {{have not been able to}} identify any genetic differences between the Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout and the Yellowstone cutthroat trout, though in terms of appearances, the Snake River subspecies has much smaller spots which cover a greater portion of the body, and the two subspecies inhabit different ecological niches. The Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout was identified by some researchers as a separate subspecies by the mid-1990s, and is managed as a distinct subspecies by the state of Wyoming, but is not yet recognized as such by the neighboring states of Idaho and Montana. Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout is found only in the Snake River and tributaries below the Jackson Lake dam to the Palisades Reservoir in Idaho. Other non-native species of trout such as the rainbow trout and lake trout were introduced by the Wyoming Fish and Game Department or migrated out of Yellowstone. Today five trout species inhabit park waters. Native species of fish include the mountain whitefish, longnose dace, mountain sucker and non-native species include the Utah chub and Arctic grayling.Only four species of reptiles are documented in the park: three species of snakes which are the wandering garter snake, the less commonly seen valley garter snake and rubber boa, as well as one lizard species, the northern sagebrush lizard, that was first reported in 1992. None of the species are venomous. Six amphibian species have been documented including the Columbia spotted frog, boreal chorus frog, tiger salamander and the increasingly rare boreal toad and northern leopard frog. A sixth amphibian species, the bullfrog, was introduced. An estimated 10,000 insect species frequent the park; they pollinate plants, provide a food source for birds, fish, mammals and other animals, and help in the decomposition of wood. In one example of the importance of insects to the ecosystem, swarms of Army cutworm moths die in huge numbers after mating and provide a high fat and protein diet for bears and other predators. One study concluded that when this moth species is most available, bears consume 40,000 moths per day which is roughly 20,000 kcal/day.|$|R
