5|$|The added deaths, loss of aircraft, {{and length}} of the rescue {{operation}} led the USAF {{to change the way}} they planned and conducted search and rescue missions. As a result, they developed new techniques <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> improve their ability to rescue downed airmen.|$|E
5|$|Five {{weeks before}} the {{outbreak}} of World War II, on 25 July 1939, in Warsaw, the Polish Cipher Bureau revealed its Enigma-decryption techniques <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> representatives of French and British military intelligence, which {{had been unable to}} make any headway against Enigma. This Polish intelligence-and-technology transfer would give the Allies an unprecedented advantage (Ultra) in their ultimately victorious prosecution of World War II.|$|E

It was activated {{under the}} Square Division Table of Organization <b>and</b> <b>Equipment</b> (<b>TO)</b> on 1 March 1921 as the Hawaiian Division at Schofield Barracks, Oahu. The division insignia {{is based on}} the taro leaf, emblematic of Hawaii. The division was assigned the 21st Infantry Regiment and the 22nd Infantry Regiment, both of which had been assigned to the US 11th Infantry Division prior to 1921.|$|E

5|$|The Castillonnais is used {{mainly for}} {{pleasure}} riding, {{and it is}} well adapted to the mountainous terrain of the Pyrenees, which makes is useful for equestrian tourism in the area. It {{can be used for}} driving, and is sometimes seen in dressage competitions. Some Castillonnais are used for logging and as pack horses for taking food <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> mountainous areas otherwise only accessible by helicopter.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1944, the M3 {{had fallen}} out of favor even with {{airborne}} troops, despite their strong preference for compact and lightweight weapon systems. The Airborne Command had rejected the 57mm M1 in the summer of 1943 claiming its unfitness for airlifting and the Table of Organisation <b>and</b> <b>Equipment</b> (<b>TO)</b> of February 1944 still had airborne divisions keeping their 37mm guns. Nevertheless, the 82nd and the 101st, were reequipped with British-manufactured 6-pounder gun (57mm) on carriage Mk III (designed to fit into the British Horsa glider) for the Normandy airdrops. This change was officially introduced in the TO of December 1944.|$|E

5|$|CAP {{is active}} in {{disaster}} relief operations, especially {{in areas such as}} Florida, Mississippi and Louisiana that are frequently struck by hurricanes as well as Oklahoma and Texas which are frequented by large, damaging tornadoes. CAP aircrews and ground personnel provide transportation for cargo and officials, aerial imagery to aid emergency managers in assessing damage, and donations of personnel <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> local, state and federal disaster relief organizations during times of need. In 2004, several hurricanes hit the southeast coast of the United States, with Florida being the worst damaged; CAP was instrumental in providing help to affected areas.|$|E
5|$|Captain Kikunori Kijima—Gotō's {{chief of}} staff and {{commander}} of the bombardment force during the return trip to the Shortland Islands after Gotō's death in battle—claimed that his force had sunk two American cruisers and one destroyer. Furutakas captain—who survived the sinking of his ship—blamed the loss of his cruiser on bad air reconnaissance and poor leadership from the 8th fleet staff under Admiral Mikawa. Although Gotō's bombardment mission failed, Jojima's reinforcement convoy was successful in delivering the crucial men <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> Guadalcanal. Aoba journeyed to Kure, Japan, for repairs that were completed on February 15, 1943. Kinugasa was sunk one month later during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal.|$|E
5|$|Conversations {{with the}} {{previous}} game's protagonists increased the Cadet's standing with them: if the player tapped a special button on-screen during timed sections of the conversation, the bond statistic with the chosen character would be increased. The relationships built up by the player triggered special character interactions during the final chapter. Agito featured sub-missions, the game's version of side-quests, some of which changed depending on the real-world day of the week. They were given by NPCs, and could range from crafting new spells <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> performing certain actions within a combat mission. Completing quests yielded rewards such as new equipment and items.|$|E

5|$|During the US {{invasion}} of Saipan in June 1944, Japanese troop ships attempting {{to reinforce the}} defenses were sunk by submarines. Shigenori Kami, chief of operations of the Navy Staff, volunteered to command Yamashiro to carry troops <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> Saipan. If the ship actually reached the island, he intended to deliberately beach the ship {{before it could be}} sunk and to use its artillery to defend the island. After Ryūnosuke Kusaka, Chief of Staff of the Combined Fleet, also volunteered to go, Prime Minister Hideki Tōjō approved the plan, known as Operation Y-GO, but the operation was cancelled after the decisive defeat in the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19 and 20 June.|$|E
5|$|In 1912 Neubronner {{completed}} his task (set in 1909) of photographing the waterworks at Tegel using only his mobile dovecote. Almost 10 years of negotiations {{were scheduled to}} end in August 1914 with a practical test at a maneuver in Strasbourg, followed by the state's acquisition of the invention. These plans were thwarted by {{the outbreak of the}} war. Neubronner had to provide all his pigeons <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> the military, which tested them in the battlefield with satisfactory results, but did not employ the technique more widely.|$|E
5|$|Junyō ferried {{aircraft}} to Singapore in mid-August and troops <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> the Caroline Islands the following month. On 5 November 1943, she {{was hit by}} a torpedo, but the damage was light, other than the disabled rudder. The ship was under repair and refit until 29 February 1944 at Kure. The air groups of both carriers were reconstituted at Singapore on 1 November. The aircraft transferred to Truk on 1 December and then to Kavieng at the end of December before reaching Rabaul on 25 January 1944; the survivors were back at Truk on 20 February and the air group was disbanded.|$|E

5|$|On 10 December, {{the ship}} carried the Westland Whirlwinds of 848 Squadron to Singapore, {{arriving}} on 8 January 1953. She arrived back at Portsmouth on 11 February and then embarked {{part of the}} 100 Grumman Avengers transferred to the Royal Navy {{under the terms of}} the Mutual Defense Assistance Act in Norfolk, Virginia on 16 March. She arrived back in Norfolk to load the remaining aircraft on 29 April. Perseus was fitted with temporary grandstand seating ("bleachers") in June for Very Important Persons and the press during Elizabeth II's Coronation Fleet Review in Spithead.

5|$|Owers' Corner {{was named}} after Lieutenant Noel Owers, who was given the task of {{surveying}} a new route from Ilolo to Nauro. The project of constructing a jeep track to Nauro was pushed aggressively by the Chief Engineer at New Guinea Force, Brigadier John Main. Lieutenant Colonel Sidney Bleechmore was placed in charge, and was given the 7th and 2/14th Field Companies and {{a section of the}} 2/1st Mechanical Equipment Company. Work commenced on 19 August. Removing the trees allowed the sun to dry out the ground, and by adding drainage, a track was created passable by light vehicles, allowing plant <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> be brought up. Owers' Corner was reached in early September.|$|E
5|$|Players take up {{the roles}} of pilots who fly single-seat spacecraft, trading with merchants on space {{stations}} and planets, and engaging in combat against other vessels. Starting with a small spacecraft in a star system, the player's character explores the region, opening up new systems for further adventures. Each system provides opportunities to increase the pilot's wealth; aside from taking on jobs to ferry goods and hunting for bounties, the player character can engage in trade. The player character's primary goal in the game is to accumulate money, so as to buy more advanced weaponry <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> upgrade his ship.|$|E

5|$|Starting with {{a rhetorical}} {{question}} – Is NATO losing and the Taliban winning? – Amrullah Saleh discusses the uncertainty among the Afghans about 2014 – when NATO ends its combat mission in Afghanistan. He then mentions Afghans’ {{perception that the}} US is funding {{both sides of the}} conflict because Pakistan remains the key country supporting the insurgency. Amrullah Saleh also discusses why the NATO and the US remain unwilling to confront Pakistan because of their own security concerns. He advocates for a surge in the capacity of the Afghan National Security Forces. Amrullah Saleh highlights the importance of both training <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> ensure that cleared areas of Afghanistan are held, communication lines are kept open, and major population centers are defended.|$|E
5|$|The British {{returned}} in 1807. Cornelio Saavedra marched to Montevideo, but was informed at Colonia del Sacramento of {{the capture of}} the city. The British planned {{to use it as}} a lodgement for the invasion of Buenos Aires. To give difficulty to the British operations, Saavedra ordered the withdrawal of all military hardware from Colonia, considered indefensible at that point, and mobilized those troops <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> Buenos Aires to fortify the city. The renewed attack to Buenos Aires took place shortly afterwards, the invading army had 8,000 soldiers and 18 cannons—significantly more than the 1,565 men, 6 cannons and 2 howitzers used for the first British invasion attempt. After an initial victory in the pens of Miserere, the invading army entered into Buenos Aires on July 5.|$|E
5|$|The JNA {{withdrew from}} Croatia in 1992, but {{continued}} to contribute personnel <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> the Army of the Republic of Serbian Krajina (ARSK) which controlled the areas previously held by the JNA. Although the United Nations Protection Force peacekeepers deployed to the area {{on the basis of}} the Vance plan and placed most of the ARSK heavy weapons in storage, Osijek was intermittently bombarded throughout the war—the last artillery strike occurred in September 1995. The hostilities ceased in November 1995 through the Erdut Agreement securing restoration of Croatian rule in the region.|$|E
