Dew falling on grass, flower and spray (traditional imagery, {{deriving}} from OT texts such as Psalm 72:6) suggests ease, grace and delicacy generally (not progressive stages of insemination). The emphasis on Mary's freedom of choice, {{at the moment of}} the annunciation, is theologically strictly proper.|$|E
5|$|An X-ray {{study of}} {{pterosaur}} brain cavities {{revealed that the}} animals (Rhamphorhynchus muensteri and Anhanguera santanae) had massive flocculi. The flocculus is <b>a</b> <b>brain</b> region that integrates signals from joints, muscles, skin and balance organs.|$|E

50|$|Most {{contemporary}} ethologists {{view the}} elephant {{as one of}} the world's most intelligent animals. With a mass of just over 5 kg (11 lb), <b>an</b> elephant's <b>brain</b> has more mass than that of any other land animal, and although the largest whales have body masses twenty times those of a typical elephant, <b>a</b> whale's <b>brain</b> is barely twice the mass of <b>an</b> elephant's <b>brain.</b> In addition, elephants have a total of 300 billion neurons. Elephant brains are similar to humans' in terms of general connectivity and areas. The elephant cortex has as many neurons as <b>a</b> human <b>brain,</b> suggesting convergent evolution.|$|R

5|$|Playing with a {{tonsillar}} infection {{for most}} of the season, Gardiner was often slumped over his crossbar during breaks in games, nearly blacking out. After leaving for a singing lesson in June 1934, Gardiner, a baritone, collapsed. He went into a coma, from which he never woke. Gardiner died at age 29, on Wednesday, June 13, 1934, from <b>a</b> <b>brain</b> hemorrhage brought on by the infection.|$|E

Later, there was speculation about drugs and diabetes. At the post-mortem, the pathologist found three causes of death– pneumonia, brain swelling and a fatty liver. Despite his heavy drinking his liver showed no sign of cirrhosis.|$|E

50|$|This {{concept has}} been said to have {{implications}} for mind uploading or mind transference, as it indirectly addresses {{the question of whether}} an exact replica of one's brain patterns, created within <b>an</b> alternative <b>brain,</b> <b>an</b> android <b>brain,</b> or <b>a</b> virtual universe, is the same being as the person it was copied from, or another being entirely. The same question is to be considered if a technology to teleport people arises.|$|R

5|$|The {{circuits}} in the cerebellum {{are similar}} across all classes of vertebrates, including fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals. There {{is also an}} analogous brain structure in cephalopods with well-developed brains, such as octopuses.

5|$|The {{majority}} of mammals have seven cervical vertebrae (bones in the neck), including bats, giraffes, whales and humans. The exceptions are the manatee and the two-toed sloth, which have just six, and the three-toed sloth which has nine cervical vertebrae. All mammalian brains possess a neocortex, <b>a</b> <b>brain</b> region unique to mammals. Placental mammals have a corpus callosum, unlike monotremes and marsupials.|$|E
5|$|The {{most obvious}} {{difference}} between the brains of mammals and other vertebrates {{is in terms of}} size. On average, a mammal has <b>a</b> <b>brain</b> roughly twice as large as that of a bird of the same body size, and ten times as large as that of a reptile of the same body size.|$|E

50|$|Generally, infants {{are born}} with formed brain systems and their brains develop very rapidly {{during the first three}} years. The size of <b>a</b> newborn <b>brain</b> is {{approximately}} 400g and continues to grow to 1100g at the age of three, which is close to the size of <b>an</b> adult <b>brain</b> (1300-1400g).|$|R
5|$|There {{are a few}} {{types of}} {{existing}} bilaterians that lack a recognizable brain, including echinoderms and tunicates. It has not been definitively established whether {{the existence of these}} brainless species indicates that the earliest bilaterians lacked <b>a</b> <b>brain,</b> or whether their ancestors evolved in a way that led to the disappearance of a previously existing brain structure.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>brain</b> tumor is an {{abnormal}} growth of cells within the brain or inside the skull, {{and can be}} cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). Just over half of all primary brain tumors are malignant; the rest are benign, though they may still be life-threatening. In the United States in 2000, survivors of benign primary brain tumors outnumbered those who had cancerous primary brain tumors by approximately 4:1. Metastatic brain cancer is over six times more common than primary brain cancer, as it occurs in about 10–30% of all people with cancer.|$|E
