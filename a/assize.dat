5|$|The Town Hall {{was built}} in 1778, with the porch and arcade being added in 1861 and the balcony and round windows in 1932. It is a Grade II listed building. It {{replaced}} the former {{on the site of}} the Market and <b>Assize</b> Hall in the Market Place, and a Canonical House also known as 'The Exchequer', on the authority of an Act of Parliament dated 1779. The building also houses the magistrates courts and other offices. The <b>Assize</b> court last sat here in October 1970.|$|E

The <b>assizes,</b> held from November 25 to 27 at Université de Montréal, were said to be {{preliminary}} because their objective was to prepare the working material on the basis of which the subsequent <b>assizes</b> were to debate.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Assizes</b> were promulgated on the {{mainland}} of the realm as they were a reform of the <b>Assizes</b> of Ariano, promulgated by Frederick's grandfather Roger II in 1140 at Ariano Irpino, nearby to Capua. The intent was, {{as in the previous}} <b>Assizes</b> and his coming Constitutions, the strengthening of the royal power in the kingdom, usually {{at the expense of the}} noblesse.|$|R

5|$|In December 1943 a {{judge was}} taken ill, and Denning {{was asked to}} take his place as a Commissioner of <b>Assize.</b> This was {{regarded}} as a 'trial' for membership of the judiciary, and Denning was appointed Recorder of Plymouth on 17 February 1944. On 6 March 1944, while arguing a case in the House of Lords, Denning was taken aside by the Lord Chancellor and told that he wanted Denning to become a judge at the High Court of Justice in the Probate, Admiralty and Divorce Division. Denning accepted, and the announcement was made before the conclusion of the trial.|$|E
5|$|On May 12 President Arthur sailed on {{her second}} voyage to Palestine, {{counting}} Hemda Ben-Yahuda, {{the widow of}} Hebrew linguist Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, among her passengers. During the trip, an altercation between a Steward and the ship's master-at-arms resulted {{in the death of}} the latter while the ship was in Naples. Though the steward was arrested by Italian authorities, he was acquitted of murder by the <b>Assize</b> Court at Naples. After a return to New York, President Arthur sailed for Haifa on July 19 for what would be her last voyage for American Palestine.|$|E
5|$|The Treblinka {{trials of}} the 1960s took place in Düsseldorf and {{produced}} the two official West German estimates. During the 1965 trial of Kurt Franz, the Court of <b>Assize</b> in Düsseldorf concluded that at least 700,000 people were killed at Treblinka, following a report by Dr. Helmut Krausnick, director of the Institute for Contemporary History in Munich. During Franz Stangl's trial in 1969 the same court reassessed the number {{to be at least}} 900,000 after new evidence from Dr. Wolfgang Scheffler.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} royal castles, from the 12th century onwards, formed an {{essential}} network of royal storehouses in the 13th century {{for a wide}} range of goods including food, drink, weapons, armour and raw materials. Castles such as Southampton, Winchester, Bristol and the Tower of London were used to import, store and distribute royal wines. The English royal castles also became used as gaols – the <b>Assize</b> of Clarendon in 1166 insisted that royal sheriffs establish their own gaols and, in the coming years, county gaols were placed in all the shrieval royal castles. Conditions in these gaols were poor and claims of poor treatment and starvation were common; Northampton Castle appears to have seen some of the worst abuses.|$|E
5|$|The Court of King's Bench did {{act as an}} appellate body, hearing appeals {{from the}} Court of Common Pleas, eyre circuits, <b>assize</b> courts and local courts, but was not a court of last resort; its own records were sent to Parliament to be signed off on. The {{creation}} of the Court of Exchequer Chamber in 1585 created a court from which King's Bench decisions could be appealed to, and with {{the expansion of the}} Exchequer Chamber's jurisdiction in 1830 the King's Bench ceased to be an appellate court. Thanks to the Bill of Westminster and other legal fictions, the King's Bench gained much of the Common Pleas's jurisdiction, although the Common Pleas remained the sole place where real property claims could be brought.|$|E
5|$|Beckingham at {{the time}} he was {{mentioned}} in 1258 was working, probably as chief clerk, for Gilbert of Preston, the English crown's senior royal justice. This was an itinerant position, travelling in a circuit (or eyre); Gilbert's last eyre–and therefore also Beckingham's as his chief clerk–was that of 1268–72. In 1274, Beckingham himself was named an itinerant justice for Middlesex, although as yet this was not a permanent position and he was replaced by the next year. At this time he seems to have held the rank of king's serjeant. He received the commission of justice of <b>assize</b> in 1276. From 1273 to 1278, he was a senior clerk to the Court of Common Pleas, and was then made keeper of the writs and rolls of the court (custos rotulorum et brevium de banco) until 1285. In that year, Beckingham was appointed a Justice of the Common Pleas.|$|E
50|$|The {{preparation}} of the national <b>assizes</b> of 1967 started soon after {{the conclusion of the}} Preliminary <b>assizes</b> of 1966. The Estates General launched a subscription to gather the sum of $300,000 CAD, as decreed by the delegates during the preliminary <b>assizes.</b> That money went to organizing the elections, defraying the travelling expenses of the delegation from the provinces other than Quebec, paying the salary of 12 employees, renting rooms, buy publicity, office expenses (paper, stamps, copies), etc.|$|R

5|$|He {{was elected}} to Parliament in 1805 for Gatton, a rotten borough, and became Solicitor General for England and Wales in 1812 and Attorney General for England and Wales a year later. Although not happy in Parliament, having been {{returned}} only for political purposes, Garrow acted {{as one of the}} principal Whig spokesmen trying to stop criminal law reform as campaigned for by Samuel Romilly and also attempted to pass legislation to condemn animal cruelty. In 1817, he was made a Baron of the Exchequer and a Serjeant-at-Law, forcing his resignation from Parliament, and he spent the next 15 years as a judge. He was not particularly successful in the commercial cases the Exchequer specialised in, but when on <b>Assize,</b> used his criminal law knowledge from his years at the Bar to great effect. On his resignation in 1832 he was made a Privy Councillor, a sign of the respect HM Government had for him. He died on 24 September 1840.|$|E
5|$|John {{spent much}} of 1205 {{securing}} England against a potential French invasion. As an emergency measure, John recreated a version of Henry II's <b>Assize</b> of Arms of 1181, with each shire creating a structure to mobilise local levies. When the threat of invasion faded, John formed a large military force in England intended for Poitou, and a large fleet with soldiers under his own command intended for Normandy. To achieve this, John reformed the English feudal contribution to his campaigns, creating a more flexible system under which only one knight in ten would actually be mobilised, but would be financially supported by the other nine; knights would serve for an indefinite period. John built up a strong team of engineers for siege warfare and a substantial force of professional crossbowmen. The king {{was supported by a}} team of leading barons with military expertise, including William Longespée, William the Marshal, Roger de Lacy and, until he fell from favour, the marcher lord William de Braose.|$|E
5|$|In 1163 Henry {{returned}} to England, intent on reforming {{the role of}} the royal courts. He cracked down on crime, seizing the belongings of thieves and fugitives, and travelling justices were dispatched to the north and the Midlands. After 1166, Henry's exchequer court in Westminster, which had previously only heard cases connected with royal revenues, began to take wider civil cases on behalf of the king. The reforms continued and Henry created the General Eyre, probably in 1176, which involved dispatching a group of royal justices to visit all the counties in England over a given period of time, with authority to cover both civil and criminal cases. Local juries were used occasionally in previous reigns, but Henry made much wider use of them. Juries were introduced in petty assizes from around 1176, where they were used to establish the answers to particular pre-established questions, and in grand assizes from 1179, where they were used to determine the guilt of a defendant. Other methods of trial continued, however, including trial by combat and trial by ordeal. After the <b>Assize</b> of Clarendon in 1166, royal justice was extended into new areas through the use of new forms of assizes, in particular novel disseisin, mort d'ancestor and dower unde nichil habet, which dealt with the wrongful dispossession of land, inheritance rights and the rights of widows respectively. In making these reforms Henry both challenged the traditional rights of barons in dispensing justice and reinforced key feudal principles, but over time they greatly increased royal power in England.|$|E
50|$|Horsham was {{occasionally}} {{described as}} the county town of Sussex due {{to the presence of}} the county gaol and the periodic holding of the county <b>assizes</b> and quarter sessions in the town. The last <b>assizes</b> were held there in 1830, while the gaol was closed in 1845.|$|R
50|$|The Northern Circuit {{contained}} Yorkshire, Lancashire, County Durham, Northumberland, Cumberland and Westmorland. The lent <b>assizes</b> {{were held}} at York and Lancaster, and were generally attended in that order. The summer <b>assizes</b> {{were held at}} York, Durham, Newcastle, Carlisle and Appleby, and were generally attended in that order.|$|R
50|$|At {{the spring}} <b>assizes</b> in March, John Kennedy was acquitted. He was defended by Daniel O'Connell, {{who argued that}} an {{impartial}} jury was impossible, and that a ballad praising the Carrickshock 'murderers' was prejudicial. Trial of the remaining suspects was postponed to the summer <b>assizes</b> in July.|$|R
5|$|Neville was {{appointed}} as Chief Forester under King Richard I in 1198. As the official {{in charge of}} the royal forests, he held one of the four great offices of the state: the others were the justiciar, the chancellor, and the treasurer. The forester was responsible for enforcing the forest law– the special law that applied to the royal forests– and presided over the forest justices, who held forest eyres. There was also a special forest exchequer, or forest treasury. In 1198 Neville presided over an <b>Assize</b> of the Forest that was described by the chronicler Roger of Howden as greatly oppressive. The revenues could be considerable; in 1198 the forest eyre brought in £1,980. Neville stated in 1208 that over the previous {{six and a half years}} the amount raised by the various revenues of the forests had been £15,000; in 1212 it had been £4,486. Forest law was resented by the king's subjects, not just for its severity but also because of the large extent of the kingdom that it encompassed. It covered not just woodlands, but by the end of the 12th century between a quarter and a third of the whole kingdom. This extent enabled the Norman and Angevin kings to use the harsh punishments of forest law to extract large sums of money for their government.|$|E

25|$|Cases {{became so}} {{complicated}} that a special <b>assize,</b> the <b>Assize</b> of Utrum {{was established in}} the middle of the 12th century. Jurisdiction would normally lie in the Ecclesiastic Courts. The <b>Assize</b> of Utrum, especially as defined in the Constitutions of Clarendon, 1164, gave the Crown a chance to clarify difficult questions of ownership and duty in a non-religious, secular court. Often, ownership was of less importance than in determining who had rights to grain, knight service, marriage penalties and the like. These duties were defined in the manner in which the land had been granted, and by whom in the feudal chain. Frequently land would be donated to a church organization and re-let to the grantor to avoid feudal services to the great lord.|$|E
50|$|If a {{bill was}} thrown out, {{although}} {{it could not}} again be preferred {{to the grand jury}} during the same <b>assizes</b> or sessions, it could be preferred at subsequent <b>assizes</b> or sessions, but not in respect of the same offence if a petty jury had returned a verdict.|$|R

25|$|Typhus {{was also}} common in prisons (and in crowded {{conditions}} where lice spread easily), {{where it was}} known as Gaol fever or Jail fever. Gaol fever often occurs when prisoners are frequently huddled together in dark, filthy rooms. Imprisonment until the next term of court was often equivalent to a death sentence. It was so infectious that prisoners brought before the court sometimes infected the court itself. Following the <b>Assize</b> held at Oxford in 1577, later deemed the Black <b>Assize,</b> over 300 died from epidemic typhus, including Sir Robert Bell, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer. The outbreak that followed, between 1577 and 1579, killed about 10% of the English population. During the Lent <b>Assize</b> Court held at Taunton (1730) typhus caused {{the death of the}} Lord Chief Baron, as well as the High Sheriff, the sergeant, and hundreds of others. During a time when there were 241 capital offences, more prisoners died from 'gaol fever' than were put to death by all the public executioners in the realm. In 1759 an English authority estimated that each year a quarter of the prisoners had died from gaol fever. In London, typhus frequently broke out among the ill-kept prisoners of Newgate Gaol and then moved into the general city population.|$|E
