40|$|Abstract — The {{discrepancy}} between the demand (scheduled and unscheduled) for arrival slots at an airport and the available arrival slots {{on a given day}} is resolved by the Ground Delay Program (GDP). The current GDP rations the available arrival slots at the affected airport by scheduled arrival time of the flights with some <b>adjustments</b> <b>to</b> <b>balance</b> the equity between airlines. Current rationing rules do not take into account passenger flow efficiency in the rationing assignment tradeoff. This paper examines the tradeoff between airline equity and passenger flow efficiency in GDP slot allocation. A GDP Rationing Rule Simulator (GDP-RRS) was developed to calculate efficiency and equity metrics for all stakeholders. A comparison of alternate GDP rationing rules identified that passenger delays can be significantly decreased without any increase in total flight delays. Compared to the traditional Ration-by-Schedule, Ration-by-Aircraft size (RBAc) decreased the total passenger delay by 32 % and Ration-by-Passengers (RBPax) decreased total passenger delay by 60 %. Flight delays of most airlines are also decreased with this scheme. The tradeoffs between airline and passenger equity, and the implications of these results are discussed. I...|$|R

This paper addresses the issue by comparing the relative {{performance of}} three key ad-hoc routing protocols: Destination-sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV), Ad-hoc Ondemand Distance Vector (AODV) and Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR). The protocols are tested based on two scenarios, namely, tactical networks for ships and sensor-based network nodes. Four performance metrics were measured by varying the maximum speed of mobile hosts, network size and traffic load, to assess the routing capability and protocol efficiency. The simulation results indicate that AODV performs better than OSLR and DSDV in the first scenario. Although OLSR also performed relatively well, the associated high routing overhead is the dominant reason for not choosing it. On the other hand, OLSR emerged as the protocol of choice for sensor networks, where the high routing overhead is counteracted by consistently better performance in all other metrics. Due to the slow evolution of the sensor network topology, OLSR performed satisfactorily for best effort traffic but needed subtle <b>adjustments</b> <b>to</b> <b>balance</b> between latency and bandwidth to meet the requirements of delay-sensitive applications...|$|R
