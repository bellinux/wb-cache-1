25|$|I {{will say}} {{to you and to}} the colored race that men who bore arms and {{followed}} the flag of the Confederacy are, with very few exceptions, your friends. I have an opportunity of saying what I have always felt – that I am your friend, for my interests are your interests, and your interests are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people. When the time came I did the best I could, and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who think that I am doing wrong. I believe that I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in my power to bring about peace. It has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate you to take positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and wherever you are capable of going.|$|E

500|$|Norton and Leterrier disputed {{with the}} {{producers}} {{over the final}} running time: they {{wanted it to be}} near 135 minutes, while the producers wanted the film to be under two hours. This was made public, and rumors spread that Norton [...] "made it clear he won't cooperate with publicity plans if he's not happy with the final product". Norton dismissed this, [...] "Our healthy process , which is and should be a private matter, was misrepresented publicly as a 'dispute', seized on by people looking for a good story, and has been distorted {{to such a degree that}} it risks distracting from the film itself, which Marvel, Universal and I refuse to let happen. It has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> firm conviction that films should speak for themselves and that knowing too much about how they are made diminishes the magic of watching them." ...|$|E
500|$|The obverse of the Lafayette dollar {{features}} jugate, or conjoined, {{heads of}} Washington and Lafayette. Slabaugh noted Barber's account that the busts {{were based on}} the sculpture by Houdon and the medal by Caunois, but, [...] "possibly these did have some effect on the design but it has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> belief that the immediate source or idea for the design was the Yorktown Centennial medal of 1881." [...] Swiatek and Breen contended that although the ultimate ancestor of Barber's depiction of Washington was the Houdon bust, the source of the Lafayette bust and the format of the obverse [...] "was beyond doubt Peter L. Krider's Yorktown Centennial Medal (1881)". Krider, a Philadelphia engraver not employed by the Mint, issued a number of tokens and medals in the 1870s and 1880s. [...] "United States of America" [...] and [...] "Lafayette Dollar" [...] appear at {{the top and bottom of}} the obverse of the coin.|$|E

500|$|George {{preferred}} {{to stay at}} home pursuing his hobbies of stamp collecting and game shooting, and lived a life that later biographers would consider dull because of its conventionality. He was not an intellectual: on returning from one evening at the opera he wrote, [...] "Went to Covent Garden and saw Fidelio and damned dull it was." [...] Nonetheless, he was earnestly devoted to Britain and its Commonwealth. He explained, [...] "it has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> dream to identify myself with the great idea of Empire." [...] He appeared hard-working and became widely admired by the people of Britain and the Empire, as well as [...] "the Establishment". In the words of historian David Cannadine, George V and Queen Mary were an [...] "inseparably devoted couple" [...] who upheld [...] "character" [...] and [...] "family values". George established a standard of conduct for British royalty that reflected the values and virtues of the upper middle-class rather than upper-class lifestyles or vices. He was by temperament a traditionalist who never fully appreciated or approved the revolutionary changes under way in British society. Nevertheless, he invariably wielded his influence as a force of neutrality and moderation, seeing his role as mediator rather than final decision maker.|$|E
500|$|While {{promoting}} the album, Cole said [...] "R, rock and pop has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> forte" [...] {{and called the}} music something {{she wished she had}} recorded [...] "at least five years ago". She revealed her dissatisfaction with being labeled a jazz singer and her desire to showcase her versatility as an artist, saying she aimed to [...] "put out some music that we hadn't heard in a long time from anybody, really". The project was Cole's first collaboration with R producer Dallas Austin. Rashod Ollison of The Virginian-Pilot wrote the album represented how [...] " [...] had hung up the gowns and returned to her soul roots"; in past performances, Cole would wear gowns when singing jazz. During the production of the album, Verve Records stipulated that it must include original material. One of the two new songs [...] "Five Minutes Away" [...] was based on Cole's experiences with Austin and keyboard player Chanz Parkman. Prior to the album's release, CBS News Caitlin Johnson wrote that it was [...] "a sharp turn for a woman perhaps best known for singing jazz standards." [...] She connected the project to Cole's decision to reinvent herself, saying that its title represented [...] "leaving the past behind".|$|E
500|$|Woodhouse had {{a history}} of theft, robbery and affray, and said that he had [...] "fallen out of love" [...] with football. He {{admitted}} to have been involved in around 100 street fights. He said; [...] "Boxing has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> first love, even as a kid", and [...] "I love fighting...Rather than get locked up for it, I might as well get paid for it." [...] He also stated that he used to spar in the boxing gym after football training without his manager's knowledge, saying [...] "A few times at Sheffield United, Neil Warnock would drag me in and say ‘I hear you’ve been boxing’. I’d be standing there with a big black eye and a fat lip and deny it." [...] He trained under former British featherweight champion, Gary De Roux, and made his boxing debut on 8 September 2006 at Grosvenor House Hotel, London, in a welterweight contest against Dean Marcantonio, despite not having any previous amateur experience. The former footballer had lost two stone in weight since his playing days with Grimsby Town.

[...] Grohl also stated that [...] "the idea now is to step up and make [...] Odessey and Oracle" [...] - [...] the album he claimed to have listened the most during production - and that [...] "it has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> dream to mix Steely Dan with Nomeansno." [...] Amidst the amount of heavier tracks and themes Grohl decided to include the song [...] "Cheer Up, Boys (Your Make Up Is Running)", described as [...] "the most light-hearted, melodic song of all" [...] which [...] "seemed like a little ray of hope in the middle of all this despair." [...] Grohl added that there was a bigger focus on melodies even in heavier tracks such as [...] "The Pretender", [...] "Let It Die" [...] and [...] "Erase/Replace", and that album closer [...] "Home", a ballad featuring Grohl on the piano, was [...] "the best song I've ever written".|$|E
500|$|McEntire {{has often}} been {{regarded}} as one of country music's most influential female vocalists and most beloved entertainers. She is highly credited for remaining one of country's most popular female artists for nearly four decades, maintaining her success by continually incorporating contemporary musical sounds without changing her traditional vocal style. For many new artists, she has been credited as the inspiration to their careers in country music, including Faith Hill, Martina McBride, Trisha Yearwood, and LeAnn Rimes. She has also been credited as an inspiration to other performers such as Sara Evans, Kelly Clarkson, Lee Ann Womack, Terri Clark, Taylor Swift, and Carrie Underwood, The Net Music Countdown second-handedly reported, [...] "That influence has manifested itself in many ways. As a role model, she's shown others how to handle fame with grace and good humor while never backing down from her values or goals. Just as importantly, she's shown others to refuse to accept limitations on what she can do or how much she can achieve." [...] McEntire also explained to the online website, [...] "Whatever I'm doing, I feel like I'm representing country music". [...] "It's <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> main career, and it's where my loyalties lie.

500|$|Hebel {{lived in}} Karlsruhe until his death, but made {{occasional}} journeys to other regions. His wish {{to become a}} parish priest in Wiesental was never fulfilled, though he wrote an inaugural sermon for a rural parish in 1820. In this sermon he wrote, [...] "to live and die as a pastor in a peaceful country town, among honest people, has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> sole wish, up to this hour; it was what I wished for in the happiest and in the darkest moments of my life". Instead, he was [...] "led higher and higher by an invisible hand, ever further away from my modest goals". In 1805 he was offered the Lutheran parish of Freiburg im Breisgau, but he declined it {{at the behest of}} Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden. He was rewarded in 1808 with his appointment as director of the Gymnasium in Karlsruhe. In 1819 he became a prelate of the Lutheran regional church, a leading position that brought with it a seat in the Upper House of the Parliament (Ständeversammlung) of Baden. As a member of parliament he devoted himself mainly to education, the church and social policy. He later gave a speech at the consecration of the statehouse in Karlsruhe. Even though the Lutheran and Reformed regional churches of Baden merged in 1821 with strong support from his side, into today's Evangelische Landeskirche in Baden, his position as the prelate of the unified Protestant church was not endangered.|$|E
