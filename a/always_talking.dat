25|$|I {{have not}} seen Chas. Greville's book, but have read {{a good deal of}} it. It is a social outrage. And {{committed}} by one who was <b>always</b> <b>talking</b> of what he called ‘perfect gentlemen.’ I don't think he can figure now in that category. I knew him intimately. He was the vainest being—I don't limit myself to man—that ever existed; and I don't forget Cicero and Lytton Bulwer; but Greville wd. swallow garbage, and required it. Offended selflove is a key to most of his observations. He lent me a volume of his MS. once to read; more modern than these; I found, when he was not scandalous, he was prolix and prosy—a clumsy, wordy writer. The loan was made à propos of the character of Peel, which I drew in George Bentinck's Life, and which, I will presume to say, is the only thing written about Peel wh. has any truth or stuff in it. Greville was not displeased with it, and as a reward, and a treat, told me that he wd. confide to me his character of Peel, and he gave me the sacred volume, wh. I bore with me, with trembling awe, from Bruton St. to Grosr Gate. If ever it appears, you, who have taste for style and expression, will, I am sure, agree with me that, as a portrait painter, Greville is not a literary Vandyke or Reynolds; a more verbose, indefinite, unwieldy affair, without a happy expression, never issued from the pen of a fagged subordinate of the daily press.|$|E
25|$|Tuten spent 15 years {{heading the}} {{graduate}} program in creative {{writing at the}} City College of New York, which he co-founded. In that capacity, he championed the work of students Walter Mosley, Oscar Hijuelos, Philip Graham, Aurelie Sheehan, Salar Abdoh, Ernesto Quiñonez, and many others. He also teaches classes on experimental writing at The New School. He {{is on the board}} of advisors for Guernica Magazine and executive editor of Smyles & Fish. Tuten's short fiction has appeared in Granta, Conjunctions, Fence, Fiction, The New Review of Literature, Tri-Quarterly, and Harper's Magazine. In 1973, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Writing and in 2001 was given the Award for Distinguished Writing from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In describing his usage of the past in his novels (where many of them are set), Tuten once stated:The fact that I don’t write about contemporary life doesn’t mean I’m any less taken up with it. I find it too limiting to write about contemporary life just in contemporary diction, however. I don’t think there's enough flexibility. I can imagine writing about characters who feel passion for one another in a contemporary setting but I don’t, as yet, hear the language for that. But I’m always thinking about contemporary life vis a vis the way it looks in the past. I mean how it looks in the past is a reflection of what it is today. That's what interests me. I think I’m <b>always</b> <b>talking</b> about present-day life, not only political life but about the quality of passion, the quality of all relationships and love.|$|E

In April 2006, an on-line petition group calling themselves Boycottchapter27.org campaigned to [...] "pressurise [...] movie theatres not to show the film, to stop the glorification of a murderer." [...] Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, expressed her thought saying, [...] "This is another thing which will hurt me, I'm sure.

For example, to ensure that someone was <b>always</b> <b>talking</b> to Liu, they invited relatives over to the house.

500|$|During October and November 2005, Wenger became {{embroiled in}} a war of words with Chelsea manager José Mourinho. Mourinho accused Wenger of having an [...] "unprofessional obsession" [...] with Chelsea and {{labelled}} him a [...] "voyeur." [...] Mourinho was quoted as saying, [...] "He's worried about us, he's <b>always</b> <b>talking</b> about us – it's [...] Chelsea". Wenger responded by pointing out he was only answering journalists' questions about Chelsea, and described Mourinho's attitude as [...] "disrespectful". Mourinho later apologised and clarified that he regretted his [...] "voyeur" [...] comment; Wenger accepted the apology. In 2014, Mourinho reopened his feud with Wenger by calling him a [...] "specialist in failure". This {{was in response to}} Wenger's comments that Chelsea were favourites for the Premier League and managers did not want to take responsibility if they failed to win the title. Wenger said Mourinho's comments were [...] "silly and disrespectful" [...] and had embarrassed Chelsea. When asked if he regretted his remark, Mourinho replied: [...] "You have to ask him if he regrets the comments he made". In October 2014, during a Premier League match between Arsenal and Chelsea, Wenger was involved in a touchline spat with Mourinho. Wenger later apologised for his behaviour.|$|E

500|$|Shelley {{wrote to}} his wife Mary that Allegra looked pale and quiet {{when he saw her}} in 1818. When he saw her again in 1821 at the Capuchin convent in Bagnacavallo, when she was four, he again felt she looked pale and {{delicate}} and was infuriated by the Roman Catholic education she was receiving, though he had initially told Byron he approved of her being sent to a convent. [...] "(Besides) Paradise & angels ... she has a prodigious list of saints—and is <b>always</b> <b>talking</b> of the Bambino ... The idea of bringing up so sweet a creature in the midst of such trash till Sixteen!" [...] he wrote." [...] However, though Shelley thought the little girl was more serious and contemplative than he remembered, he said she had not lost her [...] "excessive vivacity." [...] After five months in the convent school, her behaviour had also improved; she obeyed the nuns readily and was well-disciplined, though Shelley didn't think the nuns had been too severe with her. The child asked Shelley to [...] "tell her mother she wanted a kiss and a gold dress and would he please beg her Papa and Mammina to visit her." [...] Allegra no longer had any real memory of Clairmont, but had grown attached to [...] "her Mammina," [...] Byron's mistress Teresa, Countess Guiccioli, who had mothered her. Teresa gave the little girl her own childhood toys and played with her when she spent weeks recovering from a childhood illness.|$|E
500|$|The Smashing Pumpkins {{have been}} praised as [...] "responsible {{for some of}} the most {{striking}} and memorable video clips" [...] and for having [...] "approached videos from a completely artistic standpoint rather than mere commercials to sell albums". |author=Greg Prato |work=Allmusic |accessdate=March 4, 2012}} MTV's 2001 anniversary special Testimony: 20Years of Rock on MTV credited the Pumpkins, along with Nine Inch Nails, with treating music videos as an art form during the 1990s. Corgan has said, [...] "We generally resisted the idea of what I call the classic MTV rock video, which is like lots of people jumping around and stuff." [...] The band worked with video directors including Kevin Kerslake ("Cherub Rock"), Samuel Bayer ("Bullet with Butterfly Wings"), and, most frequently, the team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris ("Rocket", [...] "1979", [...] "Tonight, Tonight", [...] "The End Is the Beginning Is the End", and [...] "Perfect"). Corgan, who was frequently heavily involved in the conception of the videos, said of Dayton and Faris, [...] "I know my [...] versions are always darker, and they're <b>always</b> <b>talking</b> me into something a little kinder and gentler." [...] Videos like [...] "Today", [...] "Rocket", and [...] "1979" [...] dealt with images taken from middle American culture, albeit exaggerated. The group's videos so often avoid the literal interpretation of the song lyrics that the video for [...] "Thirty-Three", with images closely related to the words of the song, was created as an intentional stylistic departure.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{shooting}} of Help!, a piano was placed {{on one of the}} stages where filming was being conducted and McCartney took advantage of this opportunity to tinker with the song. Richard Lester, the director, was eventually greatly annoyed by this and lost his temper, telling McCartney to finish writing the song or he would have the piano removed. The patience of the other Beatles was also tested by McCartney's work in progress, George Harrison summed this up when he said: [...] "Blimey, he's <b>always</b> <b>talking</b> about that song. You'd think he was Beethoven or somebody!" ...|$|E

2500|$|On September 12, 2015, a Facebook post by {{the student}} {{government}} president Payton Head described bigotry and anti-gay sentiment around the college campus, which gained widespread attention. He claimed that in an incident off campus, unidentified people {{in the back of}} a passing pickup truck directed racial slurs at him. [...] "For those of you who wonder why I'm <b>always</b> <b>talking</b> about the importance of inclusion and respect, it's because I've experienced moments like this multiple times at THIS university, making me not feel included here." [...] Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin called the incident [...] "totally unacceptable" [...] on September 17.|$|E
2500|$|Moreno's lyrics were {{described}} by Time as [...] "suggesting emotions rather than announcing them". Moreno himself described his lyrics as ambiguous and sometimes impersonal, saying: [...] "I {{like to be}} ambiguous when writing to a certain extent, and throwing something so brash [...] against that and playing with it. And also making it sound dimensional. Giving the feeling off that it is raw and it is emotional, but it's not just connected with our personal story. It's not merely about our career and our lives, it's bigger than that. When I hear the music, I get inspired to paint the lyrical pictures you describe, but I'm not <b>always</b> <b>talking</b> about myself". The band's legacy {{has been compared to}} alternative rock group Radiohead, with some dubbing Deftones [...] "The Radiohead of metal".|$|E

[...] Presley's girlfriend June Juanico complained the singer was <b>always</b> <b>talking</b> about his friend Adams and James Dean. She also was upset that Adams had started inviting himself to see Elvis, and Juanico felt that she was trying to compete for Elvis' attention. Adams would talk often about Natalie Wood to Elvis, constantly discussing her figure and her beauty, something else that caused Juanico to feel that she would soon lose Elvis to the glitz of Hollywood. Presley's own mother even commented about Adams, [...] "He sure is a pushy little fellow".|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Come Up Show following a recent performance in Canada in April 2011, Method Man replied with this regarding his current 'weed-loving' image: [...] "When you get older and you've got kids and your {{kids are going to}} school and you know [...] teachers...and they see how active you are and concerned [...] with your kids' education or well being, it's hard to sit there and be taken seriously if people are <b>always</b> <b>talking</b> about he's always high...which is totally not the case", he said.

2500|$|Following Behind the Green Door, the Mitchell Brothers and Chambers {{teamed up}} for Resurrection of Eve, {{released}} in September 1973. Although not the runaway blockbuster that Green Door was, Eve {{was a hit}} and a well-received entry into the porno chic market. It also helped set Chambers apart from her contemporaries Linda Lovelace and Georgina Spelvin as the wholesome, all-American girl next door. Following Eve, Chambers was anxious to transition her fame into other areas of entertainment. At the time the Mitchell Brothers were still her managers. [...] "They were <b>always</b> <b>talking</b> about some half-assed idea I knew wouldn't come off", Chambers said in 1992. Flakes' is a terrible word but they were, in a cute sort of way". Chambers had always considered the brothers as her own brothers but when she abruptly announced that she was leaving them to take up with Chuck Traynor, they were appalled and had a falling out with Chambers.|$|E

2500|$|Helen Chadwick (18 May 1953 – 15 March 1996) was a British sculptor, {{photographer}} and installation artist. In 1987, she {{became one of}} the first women artists to be nominated for the Turner Prize. Chadwick was known for [...] "challenging stereotypical perceptions of the body in elegant yet unconventional forms. [...] Her work draws from a range of sources, from myths to science, grappling with a plethora of unconventional, visceral materials that included chocolate, lambs tongues and rotting vegetable matter. Her skilled use of traditional fabrication methods and sophisticated technologies transform these unusual materials into complex installations. Maureen Paley noted that [...] "Helen was <b>always</b> <b>talking</b> about craftsmanship—a constant fount of information". Binary oppositions was a strong theme in Chadwick's work; seductive/repulsive, male/female, organic/man-made. Her combinations [...] "emphasise yet simultaneously dissolve the contrasts between them". Her gender representations forge a sense of ambiguity and a disquieting sexuality blurring the boundaries of ourselves as singular and stable beings." ...|$|E

[...] "Starch" [...] is her response to potatoes, {{which is not}} that bad, but her response for [...] "bathroom" [...] is [...] "Mr. Kirby," [...] and she covers {{it up with the}} fact that Mr. Kirby {{spends a lot of time}} in there [...] "bathing and shaving". Her response to [...] "lust" [...] is [...] "human," [...] claiming it is a perfectly human emotion. Mr. Kirby disagrees, saying [...] "it is depraved."

[...] The shocker comes when Mrs. Kirby says her reply to [...] "sex" [...] was [...] "Wall Street".

And we were <b>always</b> <b>talking</b> {{from the very beginning}} that if you're going to have cowboys, they need a trusty horse." [...] He originally intended for the car to be a '65 Mustang, but his neighbor convinced him to change it to a '67 Impala, since [...] "you can put a body in the trunk" [...] and because [...] "you want a car that, when people stop next to it at the lights, they lock their doors." [...] Kripke has commented, [...] "It's a Rottweiler of a car, and I think it adds authenticity for fans of automobiles because of that, because it's not a pretty ride.
