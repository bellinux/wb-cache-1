5|$|Although Utor tracked {{back over}} water on December10, the storm began to weaken due to {{increasing}} wind shear <b>and</b> <b>dry</b> {{air from the}} west. As a result, the JMA downgraded Utor to severe tropical storm intensity upon its emergence into the South China Sea. Despite these hindering conditions, the storm's improved outflow was sufficient enough to enable redevelopment. At 18:00UTC on December11, the JMA once again upgraded the system to typhoon strength southeast of Hainan. Intensification continued until Utor peaked with winds of 155km/h (100mph) and a minimum pressure of 945mbar (hPa; 27.91inHg) the next day. This strength was held for only twelve hours before Utor's outflow began to succumb to the wind shear <b>and</b> <b>dry</b> air stemming from the monsoonal flow it had previously suppressed. Traveling in a tight clockwise loop, the typhoon rapidly weakened on December13; by the following day Utor was a minimal tropical storm. At 06:00UTC on December14, the storm degenerated into a tropical depression and continued to execute a small anticyclonic loop before dissipating on December15.|$|E

Currently, the export of salted <b>and</b> <b>dried</b> cod, to Africa, has increased and {{a great amount of}} product is rejected due to the high environmental temperature and the lack of a proper cold chain storage infrastructure.
