5|$|Grammar is {{the study}} of how {{meaningful}} elements called morphemes within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called words, and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they <b>are</b> <b>called</b> affixes. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words <b>are</b> <b>called</b> morphology. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences <b>are</b> <b>called</b> syntax.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{considered}} Ankylosaurus so distinct {{that he made}} it {{the type}} genus of a new family, Ankylosauridae (members of which <b>are</b> <b>called</b> ankylosaurids), typified by massive, triangular skulls, short necks, stiff backs, broad bodies, and osteoderms. He also classified Palaeoscincus (only known from teeth), and Euoplocephalus (then only known from a partial skull and osteoderms) {{as part of the}} family. Due to the fragmentary remains, Brown was unable to fully distinguish between Euoplocephalus and Ankylosaurus. Only having few, incomplete members of the family to compare with, he believed the group was part of the suborder Stegosauria. In 1923, Osborn coined the name Ankylosauria (members of which <b>are</b> <b>called</b> ankylosaurs or ankylosaurians), thereby placing the ankylosaurids in their own suborder.|$|E
