Morris expressed that [...] "I think the time is right. After the first film, I wanted to hear more from Jay, Will, Neil and Simon. But this time I feel there is enough. There {{is more than enough}} Jay in this world", and Beesley added [...] "The end of the story has always felt like the time where they go off and start living their adult life. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> film takes us up to that point".|$|E
500|$|Critics {{agreed that}} this album {{represents}} a more [...] "mature" [...] Blink-182, hence {{the absence of}} songs with toilet humour or jokes for which the band had been known. [...] "We wanted to be different," [...] remarked DeLonge. [...] "Some of our fans were probably like, 'Fuck, maybe they should stop joking so people could hear why I like this band.' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> record {{is going to help}} those kids out.". In an interview with MTV Album Launch, Hoppus said that the desired effect of the album was for people to listen to it and say, [...] "Wait a minute...that's Blink-182?" [...] The themes for the album include growing up and dealing with the realities of adulthood including relationship woes, daily pressures, and unexpected hardships.|$|E
500|$|In early 2013, Gosling {{announced}} that he was taking a break from acting, stating,“I’ve lost perspective on what I’m doing. I think it’s good for me {{to take a break and}} reassess why I’m doing it and how I’m doing it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> is probably a good way to learn about that.” Gosling's directorial debut Lost River competed in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. The [...] "fantasy noir", written by Gosling, stars Christina Hendricks, Ben Mendelsohn, and Matt Smith. The film received largely unfavorable reviews. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian found it [...] "insufferably conceited" [...] and remarked that Gosling had lost [...] "any sense of proportion or humility." [...] Robbie Collin of The Telegraph described Lost River as [...] "mind-bogglingly pleased with itself", while Varietys Justin Chang dismissed the [...] "derivative" [...] film as a [...] "train-wreck." ...|$|E

500|$|The 1997 state {{referendum}} {{stated that}} the stadium would feature a natural grass surface, but FieldTurf {{was not an option}} when the stadium was originally presented to voters according to the Public Stadium Authority. Seahawks management reconsidered surface after the Seahawks played on FieldTurf at Husky Stadium during the 2000 and 2001 seasons. Artificial turf was installed because it was easier to maintain than natural grass. The potential damage to a natural grass field caused by Seattle's frequent rain also made the surface an appealing option. In order to keep a grass surface robust under heavy football use during late fall and early winter rains, a $1.8million irrigation and heating system would have been required. The coach of the Seahawks at the time, Mike Holmgren, said FieldTurf installation was the right decision and stated that [...] "the players love it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> surface will offer a better product on the field for the fans." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2001, Aaliyah {{finished}} {{recording the}} album after having filmed her part in Queen of the Damned for four months, which ultimately delayed the album's release. In Australia, she also did {{a photo shoot}} for Aaliyah with photographers Jeff Dunas, Jonathan Mannion, David LaChapelle, and Albert Watson. Aaliyah handled five pythons at the shoot and developed an affinity for snakes, finding them [...] "dangerous, but quite beautiful" [...] and representative of her on the album. She revisited the snake theme in her music video for [...] "We Need a Resolution" [...] in April and told MTV, [...] "They live in solitude, [...] there are {{times in my life}} [...] I just want to be by myself. There are times I can't even figure myself out. I feel they are very complex creatures, [...] at the same time, they're sexy, too. That's why they represent Aaliyah pretty well." [...] She described the record as [...] "a good reflection of [...] and the person [...] today", saying in an interview for Jet magazine, [...] "I am a young adult now, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> album shows my growth vocally." [...] Aaliyah was mastered by Bernie Grundman at his studio in Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|In September 2010, Waters {{commenced}} The Wall Live tour, {{an updated}} version of the original Pink Floyd shows, featuring a complete performance of The Wall. Waters told the Associated Press that The Wall Tour will likely be his last, stating: [...] "I'm not as young as I used to be. I'm not like B.B. King, or Muddy Waters. I'm not a great vocalist or a great instrumentalist or whatever, but I still have the fire in my belly, and I have something to say. I have a swan song in me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> will probably be it." [...] At The O2 Arena in London on 12 May 2011, Gilmour and Mason once again appeared with Waters and Gilmour performing [...] "Comfortably Numb", and Gilmour and Mason joining Waters for [...] "Outside the Wall". For the first half of 2012, Waters' tour topped worldwide concert ticket sales having sold more than 1.4 million tickets globally. As of 2013, The Wall Live is the highest-grossing tour of all time by a solo artist. Waters performed at [...] at Madison Square Garden on 12 December 2012. On 24 July 2015, Waters headlined the Newport Folk Festival in Newport, Rhode Island. Waters was accompanied by the band My Morning Jacket and two singers from the group Lucius.|$|E

2500|$|On March 24, 2015, {{during an}} {{interview}} in Paraguay, Foster The People announced that {{they were working on}} a third album. When describing their upcoming record, they said that [...] "the first record was more, kind of, electro-pop, the second record was more of a rock record, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> one {{is going to be a}} little more hip hop".|$|E
2500|$|Most {{contemporary}} Christian {{leaders and}} scholars from mainstream churches, such as Anglicans and Lutherans, consider {{that there is}} no conflict between the spiritual meaning of creation and the science of evolution. According to the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, [...] "...for most of the history of Christianity, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> is fair enough, most {{of the history of the}} Christianity there's been an awareness that a belief that everything depends on the creative act of God, is quite compatible with a degree of uncertainty or latitude about how precisely that unfolds in creative time." ...|$|E
2500|$|January 31, 2006 - Brian Tobin announces he {{will not}} seek the {{leadership}} of the Liberal Party of Canada. Mr. Tobin rationalized his stepping out of the running as an opportunity for the Liberal Party to heal, revitalize and rejuvenate itself. In his words: [...] "... I think it's time for new blood and I think it's time for new players <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> is an opportunity for the Liberal party to renew itself and, in the process, to heal itself a little bit as well."

2500|$|In Diana Wynne Jones' Charmed Life (1977), two {{orphaned}} children receive magical education {{while living}} in a castle. The setting is a world resembling early 1900s Britain, where magic is commonplace. Diana Wynne Jones has stated in {{answer to a question}} on her webpage: [...] "I think Ms Rowling did get quite a few of her ideas from my books – though I have never met her, so I {{have never been able to}} ask her. My books were written many years before the Harry Potter books (Charmed Life was first published in 1977), so any similarities probably come from what she herself read as a child. Once a book is published, out in the world, it is sort of common property, for people to take ideas from and use, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> is what happened to my books." ...|$|E
2500|$|The chapel {{was given}} a new {{exterior}} covering that ensured {{that it would be}} visually integrated within the overall building. The chapel itself dates from the 19th century. One of the family heirs, Mário Cabral, remembered that the owner wanted to preserve the chapel: “The chapel wasn’t demolished; it was integrated within the overall construction. The part of the building including the chapel was built upon the pre-existing construction. The chapel was inserted within the overall design, but preserved in its original form; as a 19th century chapel. The chapel was used regularly in the local neighbourhood. The locals came to mass here <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> influenced him and therefore he didn’t want to demolish it. That was a general idea shared between him and all the architects working with him... one of the amusing aspects was {{the manner in which they}} made the cross; the cross was essentially designed by Ruhlman...... which is quite amazing.” ...|$|E

60|$|At {{the back}} of the house, however, there was nothing about the barn, the cow-yard, the chicken-yard, and the haystacks to {{indicate}} that Captain Jabe was anything more than a thrifty small-farmer.
