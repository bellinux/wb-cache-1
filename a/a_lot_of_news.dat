Murdoch states that adherence to business models based upon advertising on the part of news papers is responsible for declining revenues. Additionally, those who consume <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>news</b> offline will access online news more frequently.

5000|$|The {{corresponding}} {{of ideology}} in the Canadian newspapers and young Canadians are not relevantly sharing equal beliefs or information {{in terms of}} democracy society. In at least two aspects, the Canadian newspapers obstacle in their duty to foster Young Canadians of voting act: first, the numbers of young Canadian newspaper readerships are very low. [...] Marshall McLuhan said, [...] "People don't actually read newspapers." [...] Statistically, 68% of adults 18-34 read last weekday issue of their community newspapers, compared to only 34% read their last weekday daily newspaper based on Canada demographics conducted by ComBase. [...] In addition to statistics of young adults readership, Tiffany Conroy from Canadian Community Newspapers Association adds,"23% of adults 18-24 read any community newspaper last week, but did not read any daily newspaper." [...] A result of not reading daily newspaper {{is very hard to}} retain exclusive issues. The issue of not reading daily newspaper has strong relations to less engaged to act of voting. [...] "The newspaper is the direct result of a national campaign by publishers, known as [...] "Newspapers in Education" [...] (NIE) according to Nola Kortner Aiex. [...] As American Newspaper Publishers Association Foundation proposes [...] "The Newspaper as an Effective Teaching Tool" [...] (1981) explains the intent of the program and provides a variety of classroom activities using newspapers." [...] The role of newspaper is significantly used for young adults as Aiex debates on Using Newspapers as Effective Teaching Tool. Second, the newspapers allow political debate to be monopolized by ideologues who adhere dogmatically to their respective political catechisms. [...] As Robert A. Hackett argues the notions like propaganda and indoctrination are implied to manipulate and persuade in news media. [...] Based on the evidence of The Star and Globe political agenda-settings presented, it would be premature to talk of a crisis of representing election campaign. [...] "We cover the campaigns more than the election. We cover the narrative of the day-to-day event. We cover the news. The problem is there isn’t actually whole <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>news</b> in the campaign." [...] declared Andre Coyne, national editor, MacLean’s magazine who discussed newspaper coverage of the election campaign including narrative-setting, agendas, bias, and spin on September 27th 2011 at University of Toronto, St.Michael’s College class with Dr. Gerald Caplan, political columnist at Globe and Mail. They also argued that a lot of coverage unfortunately is aimed at political gentlemen. Moreover, they talked about how well newspapers are focusing the issues of election campaigns. The fact is that young Canadians tend to be committed to their own structured democracy which differs from that of the parent generations. [...] "The differences can mainly be seen in the ways that today’s youth engage in politics, which is primarily through non-electoral activities." [...] Conceptual links between young Canadian values and Canadian newspapers are not contributed to social cohesion, depending on the degree of difference that separates groups in their fundamental values by perceiving Hackett’s [...] "The News Media and Civic Equality: Watch Dogs, Mad Dogs, or Lap Dogs?

To make it easy for user to find news with the topic user want, the program is created to automate the news clustering so that user can easily find the related news. The program will implement the kmeans algorithm. K-means algorithm is one of the algorithm for clustering which has long existed. It has been proven in many implementations of program. K-means use euclidean distance to count data point distance between data and centroid. The euclidean distance between all the centroid compared to find the nearest distance. All the euclidean with the nearest distance with the same centroid will be searched for average. The average will be the new centroid data. The process is repeated until the new centroid data not changed or similar with the previous centroid data.
