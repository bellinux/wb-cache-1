25|$|The {{last game}} of the round robin of the NatWest Series was, as expected, won by the Australians. However, it summed up the {{improvement}} Bangladesh had made over the tour of England. In the first international, they were rolled over meekly by a no-balling, rusty English side – twice. In the last, Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie put the pressure on early, and {{with the aid of}} Shane Watson had them on the reels with 75 for 5. Yet, Bangladesh recovered to post 250 for 8, and were theoretically in with a chance for most of the game. Yet, they started very, very shakily. Javed Omar was dropped by Matthew Hayden in the third over, only to be out to Jason Gillespie in the next for an eight-ball duck – a disappointing end to a fine series for the Bangladeshi. Brett Lee had both Tushar Imran and Mohammad Ashraful beaten with full deliveries, Bangladesh were 19 for three wickets down – an <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>familiar</b> position.|$|E
25|$|Streak was {{dismissed}} {{early in the}} morning, but spirited innings from Coventry and Blignaut, along with Masakadza's third Test fifty, delayed the result somewhat, preventing Zimbabwe from suffering their sixth successive innings defeat. Coventry added a belligerent 25 before holing out to Ganguly at midwicket, while Blignaut was the beneficiary of five dropped chances by the Indian fielders – including three in an over bowled by Zaheer Khan. At the other end, however, the 22-year-old Masakadza composed 71, his highest Test score {{for four years and}} his third-highest score overall. Masakadza and Blignaut raced away, adding 151 before lunch, and they took the score to 201 for 6 before an <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>familiar</b> collapse struck. Masakadza started it, trapped lbw by Pathan, and Dabengwa and Mahwire both went for ducks. Zimbabwe needed three runs to avoid the innings defeat, and once they were provided, Blignaut started swinging. He hit two sixes after the departure of Mahwire, but debutant Mwayenga deserted him, lbw to Zaheer for 1.|$|E

For instance the Hepatitis C scandal, the withholding of baby organs without parental consent or knowledge, the Michael Neary saga in Drogheda and other high-profile medical scandals have dogged the minister and department.

50|$|Like his predecessors, {{the wars}} with the Saracens {{continued}} relatively unabated. Before becoming Emperor, Constantine IV was {{the administrator of}} his father's lands for the eastern portions of the Empire, what few territories they were. They became fewer still when the Arabs began taking one Imperial Byzantine city after another {{along the coast of}} Ionia. Finally in 672, Muawiya the Caliph captured the peninsula of Cyzicus, only 50 mi from Constantinople. The scene was <b>all</b> <b>too</b> depressingly <b>familiar</b> — the capital was under threat and the odds were not favorable to the defenders — the Arabs had brought with them heavy siege weapons and began the siege of Constantinople in 674. Despite this, Constantinople was simply too much for the Arabs — where else before disunity, sheer bad luck or skill & zeal had given the warriors of Islam victory, now it was the defenders of the capital who, armed with Greek fire repelled every Arab assault. Finally in 678, after suffering massive casualties, the Saracens withdrew and Muawiya accepted an offer of peace. By 680, Muawiya was dead and Constantine IV, now {{at the height of his}} popularity, had managed to defeat the Arabs, both at land in Lycia and at sea.|$|R

[...] He felt the game failed to appeal specifically to younger gamers, adults or Tolkien fans; [...] "The Hobbit is a game that doesn't know what audience it's going for. Its look and feel is too juvenile for adults, and some of its challenges are too difficult and frustrating for kids.

2500|$|Some {{films were}} more potent with propagandistic {{symbolism}} than others. [...] Fifth Column Mouse is a cartoon that through childlike humor and political undertones depicted a possible outcome of World War II. [...] The film {{begins with a}} bunch of mice playing and singing a song about how they never worry. [...] One mouse notices a cat looking in through a window, but is calmed when another mouse tells him that the cat cannot get inside. [...] The cat however, bursts in through the front door alerting a mouse that wears a World War II style air raid warden helmet and screams, “Lights out,” promptly turning off the main light. [...] The phrase, 'lights out,' was a popular saying during the war, especially in major cities to encourage people to turn off their lights to hinder targeting by potential enemy bombers. [...] The same mouse who said the cat could not get inside, ends up getting caught by the cat. [...] The cat tells him that he will not kill him, but will give him cheese if the mouse follows the cat's instructions. [...] During the dialogue between the two, the cat's smile resembles the Tojo bucktooth grin and it speaks with a Japanese accent. [...] Near the end, the cat screams “Now get going!” and the mouse jumps to attention and gives the infamous Nazi salute. [...] The scene cuts to the biddable mouse, now an agent of influence, telling the other mice that the cat is here to “save us and not to enslave us,” “don’t be naughty mice, but appease him” so “hurry and sign a truce.” [...] This message of appeasement and signing a truce would have been <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>familiar</b> to the adults in the theaters who were probably with their children. [...] The next clip is of the cat lounging on pillows with multiple mice tending to its every need. [...] However, when the cat reveals that he wants to eat a mouse they all scatter. [...] Inside their hole, a new mouse is encouraging the others to be strong and fight the cat. [...] The mice are then shown marching in step with hardy, confident grins on their faces with “We Did it Before and We Can Do it Again” by Robert Merrill playing in the background. [...] Amidst the construction of a secret weapon, a poster of a mouse with a rifle is shown with the bold words “For Victory: Buy Bonds and Stamps.” [...] The mice have built a mechanical dog that chases the cat out of the house. [...] Before he leaves though a mouse skins the cat with an electric razor, but leaves three short dots and a long streak of fur on his back. [...] In Morse code, the letter [...] "V" [...] is produced through dot-dot-dot-dash. [...] As depicted in many pictures but made popular by Winston Churchill, the “V” for victory sign was a popular symbol of encouragement for the Allies.
