The “Binder Accelerated Separator” method was used to divide the constituents of the Asphalt Rubber and bio-binder (residual binder and swelled rubber). The physical and chemical changes in the Asphalt Rubber and bio-binder and in the residual binders (residual bitumen and residual bio-oil) were evaluated. The results demonstrate that the produced bio-binder is suitable for use in flexible pavements with properties comparable to those of conventional and Asphalt Rubber binders...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: One of the {{effective}} {{ways to improve the}} properties of special bitumens are their chemical and physical modification. When considering a chemical approach, we assumed that a process of oxidative polymerization is connected with radical-chain reactions. That is why when carrying out an oxidizing process of residual oil stock, it is necessary to use the modifiers, which are able to take part in this process, subjecting the segments of paraffin chains to chemical structuring with further formation of polycyclic naphthene-aromatic fragments, promoting the intense resin formation and preventing from the formation of the asphaltene crystalline phase. The analysis of physical-mechanical properties of bituminous insulating materials (BIM), based on acidified flux oil, showed the ambiguity of their assessment, i. e. at identical speeds of fuel-oil residues oxidation processes, there are differences in strength properties of coverings (C). The properties of air-blown <b>asphaltic</b> <b>bitumen</b> are regulated by resizing of the core and solvation shell of the complex structural unit (CSU) by injection of multicomponent bifunctional modifier (MBM), promoting the reduction of oxidation duration and the improvement of physical-mechanical and insulation properties of BIM.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} study is to apply mass spectrometric geochemical techniques to the investigation of palaeoenvironmental, chemostratigraphic and provenance questions from several South Australian Phanerozoic basins. Results of a multi-pronged palaeoenvironmental investigation of Early Cambrian marine sediments, employing trace and REE abundances, TOC and stable isotopes (C, S) are reported from three formations in the Stansbury Basins; Heatherdale Shale, Emu Bay Shale and Talisker Formation. The multiproxy approach in conjunction with sedimentological information provides a powerful tool for interpreting palaeoenvironmental conditions. Prevalent palaeoredox conditions of the Heatherdale Shale and Talisker Formation were dysoxic, evolving progressively more reducing natures up section. The Emu Bay Shale conversely demonstrates consistently aerobic interpretations for the redox proxies. Comparison of trace element and REE distributions to similar sequences of the Yangtze platform, South China shows striking similarities, Analogous basinal environments and common provenance may have lead to the seawater trace element chemistry of the Palaeo Pacific & Asian oceans exhibiting a homogenous nature. The Emu Bay Shale biota is the richest Burgess Shale-type (BST) fauna in the southern hemisphere. The implied oxic water column during accumulation appears difficult to reconcile with the exceptional preservation exhibited. Micro-scale sealed vessel (MSSV) pyrolysis of isolated kerogen and δ¹³Corg values provided confirmation of its redox status and implicate cyanobacteria in the preservation mechanism. Molecular signatures diagnostic of Gloeocapsomorpha prisca were identified, the first indication that microbial mats were involved in the taphonomy of a BST deposit. The biostratigraphic definition of GSSP horizons though the use of cosmopolitan taxa biohorizons is problematical for sections such as lower Cambrian deposits where few candidate fossils exist. Instead, an integrated approach comprising chemostratigraphy and/or sequence stratigraphy with the known biostratigraphy greatly increases our ability to make high-resolution correlations., δ¹³Ccarb profiles from three South Australian basins; the Stansbury, the Arrowie and the Officer are correlated regionally with the existing data from the Flinders Ranges. Globally identified excursions such as the negative ROECE and AECE event and the positive CARE and MICE events, are recognised in the profiles. This chemostratigraphic interpretation appears to support the biostratigraphic assignment of the sections. <b>Asphaltic</b> <b>bitumens</b> are long known to strand along coastlines of southern Australia and as far afield as New Zealand and Macquarie Island. Widely regarded as artefacts of an unidentified submarine oil seepages, a common source is interpreted from remarkably uniform compositions. An important consideration when attempting to locate their point of origin is the degree of weathering exhibited, which will reflect the residence time in the marine environment and proximity of the seep to the stranding site. Biomarker signatures and n-alkane C-isotopic profiles from interior and weathered exterior sub-samples of asphaltum from four localities in South Australia and New Zealand were compared. No distinction could be made between strandings despite their widely separated localities. The degree of degradation and isotopic variance suggest an origin from low intensity seeps in the western Otway Basin as strandings on the Limestone Coast and Kangaroo Island appear less weathered than those from Eyre Peninsula and New Zealand.

30|$|There {{are many}} {{important}} {{studies on the}} comparison of solid bitumen and source rock. For example; upper Jurassic–lower Cretaceous solid bitumen and bituminite properties of Chia Gara formation in the northern Iraq–Kurdistan region, Kirkuk oil field, were evaluated by Kus et al. (2016). The presence of oil spills and the association with solid bitumen in the cracks and spaces between the granules were stated to be a genetic relationship with the liquid hydrocarbon formation process of the Chia Gara formation. Another study {{was carried out by}} Gonçalves et al. (2015) at the sub-(Lusitanian Basin, Portugal). The middle Jurassic to Cretaceous sedimentary record in the Lusitanian Basin (Portugal) reveals the presence of disseminated solid bitumen. With the help of the results obtained by optical microscopy (fluorescence and reflection), three different solid bitumen types were identified and they corresponded to allochthonous (migrated) bitumens. According to this research, the presence of allochthonous bitumen indicates hydrocarbon formation and / or migration movements in the Lusitanian Basin or adjacent basins. In a study by Fink et al. (2016) the solid bitumens determined in the calcite cracks in the Natih Formation limestones in the Oman Mountains have been investigated in order to evaluate the oil migration mechanisms in this area. According to study, the solid bitumen formed in multiple events and were most likely derived from the Natih B source rocks. Additionally, the <b>asphaltic</b> solid <b>bitumen</b> was identified in the pore spaces of the middle Jurassic Khatatba sandstone reservoir in the Tut Field, Egypt (Shalaby et al. 2012). Organic geochemical data indicate active non-biodegrade hydrocarbons in Khatatba sandstones. Also, biomarker data suggest that the bitumen originated from a marine shale source rock that was deposited in anoxic to suboxic conditions and the natural deasphalting is the dominant mechanism for the formation of the bitumen.|$|R
40|$|Crystalline {{paraffin}} can impair the use {{characteristics of}} bitumen by showing increased brittleness at low temperatures, reduced adhesiveness and a viscosity anomaly at dissolving of the crystals in the bitumen matrix caused by temperature. The extent of these impairments {{depends on the}} chemical composition and crystallisation capability of the paraffin; macro-crystalline paraffin (predominantly n-alkanes) has a greater effect than micro-crystalline paraffin (predominantly iso and cyclo-alkane), as the iso and cyclo-alkanes crystallise in a poorer way and thus are more compatible with the bitumen matrix than the n-alkanes. The effects of the paraffin were confirmed experimentally on real and model systems. They are so slight that bitumens with less than 2. 2 % DIN paraffin can in this respect be considered as uncritical. Consistency data such as the dynamic storage module or the load limit for yield stress are to be considered as significant quality characteristics for the cohesion of bitumen. They are mainly influenced {{by the type of}} colloid system. Type of bitumen with high proportions of low soluble asphalts or unfavourable solvent u separator conditions for this fraction are conspicuous in particular as a result of comparatively lower yield stress values. For the further research activities concerning binders it follows that the connection between colloid systems and the named consistency data should be examined in greater detail. The aim should be to formulate specifications for <b>asphaltic</b> <b>bitumen</b> via its colloid-chemical composition. (orig.)

40|$|The use of {{biomaterials}} from {{renewable sources}} in the synthesis of polyurethane-derived polymers is lately receiving great attention from social, environmental and economic standpoints. In this work, prepolymers having different -NCO/-OH ratio were synthesized, by reaction of 4, 4 ´-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) with castor oil (CO), {{to be used as}} modifying agent of <b>asphaltic</b> <b>bitumen.</b> Reactions between MDI and CO, performed with -NCO/-OH molar ratios of 8 : 1 and 4 : 1, have led to suitable bitumen modifiers. Modification has been related to chemical reactions between -NCO groups, some bitumen compounds and air moisture (or added water), which gave rise to binders with enhanced resistance to permanent deformation. The results showed that a 2 wt. % of MDI-CO prepolymer leads to binders with higher viscosity than that corresponding to a 3 wt. % Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene (SBS) block copolymer, a polymer and concentration widely used in the paving industry. Furthermore, the resulting prepolymers are liquids that can be easily mixed with bitumen at 90 ºC, which significantly lowers the typical temperature used for commercial SBS-modified bitumen (about 180 ºC). This fact may represent energy savings, reduce bitumen oxidation and result in improvements of health and safety conditions during the product manufacture. However, if high processing temperatures are required, MDI-CO based modifiers have demonstrated much higher thermal stability than prepolymers derived from crude oil (e. g. based on polyethylene glycol). As a result, NCO-terminated prepolymers obtained from biomass-derived polyols (castor oil in this article) may become a promising alternative to the use of other petrochemicals in the paving industry.

40|$|In {{addition}} {{to the ability to}} withstand deformation at higher temperatures and the ability to resist cracking at lower temperatures, the ability to withstand load alternations, i. e. the fatigue resistance, is a property of asphaltic bitumens which can never be ignored for the area of road construction. For this reason the number of endurable load alternations up fracture N was investigated on asphaltic bitumens 0 / 11 having different compositions at four different test temperatures with the aid of tensile threshold tests using the principle of cross-classification. The binder content, the filler content and the type of bitumen were systematically varied with 0 / 11 asphaltic bitumens. Prismatic test bodies of <b>asphaltic</b> <b>bitumen</b> with sides of 40 x 40 x 160 mm were used for the tensile threshold tests. In the tensile threshold test, these prismatic test bodies were subjected in the direction of their longitudinal axis to a minimum stress corresponding to the cryogenic tensile stress relevant to the particular test temperature. Mechanical (traffic-load-conditioned) stresses, which were varied in four stages, were superimposed on to the cryogenic tensile stress as threshold loads. It has been established {{on the basis of the}} investigations that the fatigue resistance of asphaltic bitumens having hard or medium-hard bitumen as binder increases with increasing content of binder and with increasing content of filler. As a function of the temperature, the number of endurable load alternations reaches a maximum which is around - 20 C when using a soft bitumen and in the region of the freezing point of water when using a harder bitumen. An increase in the load brings about a reduction in the number of endurable load alternations up to fracture, whereby the reduction was exponential in form with the exponent being clearly dependent on the temperature, having a value of around - 5. 3 at - 30 C and around - 2. 6 at + 40 C.
