40|$|In various {{engineering}} problems, {{there can}} be a small amplitude AC signal accom-panied with a much larger amplitude DC signal. For example, the DC source (a battery) can be used to bias the transistors of a radio. In addition to the DC volt-ages, the signal received from the antenna having a range on the order of milivolts also appears in the system. The design goal of such a system can be the amplification of the signal of interest to a reasonable voltage level. In this section, we present the small signal approximation for resistive circuits. This topic is particularly important for the amplifier design applications. <b>A</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> engineering <b>question</b> is how we define the smallness. It should be remembered that, a small voltage for an high voltage engineer is any voltage less than 1000 V; while any voltage greater than 1 V can be beyond the reach of an electronic engineer. Therefore smallness and largeness is only applicable with in a context and we should always {{keep in mind that the}} adjectives such as small, large, fast, efficient are used for a comparison with something else. So whenever somebody tosses you an adjective, ask him or her with respect to what! For our purposes, a signal is considered to be small if the accompanying DC signal is at least an order of magnitude larger. This is just a rule of thumb. A small signal example can be given as vs(t) = 3 + 0 : 1 cos(!t) V. Figure 1. 1 shows how this signal should like on an oscilloscope screen. ...|$|R

The philosophers are approached by an angel who promises them a truthful {{answer to a question}} of their choosing. After much debate, the philosophers settle on the following: (Q 1) What is the ordered pair , where x = the best question to ask, and y = the answer to that question? 1 In response, the angel answers: “It is the ordered pair whose first member is the question you just asked me, and whose second member is this answer I am giving you. ” (1997, p. 96) That is, he offers the following answer: (A 1) The problem is that Q 1 seems like <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>question</b> to ask, but A 1 seems like a very bad answer to receive. Markosian asks: “What went wrong? ” (p. 97) Before answering Markosian’s question, we should first appreciate the paradoxical nature of his story. 2 Either Q 1 is the best question or not. Suppose that it is. Then Q 1 must have an answer, since a question without an answer would hardly be the best question to ask. Call the hypothetical answer X. If X is the answer to Q 1, then it must be an ordered pair consisting of Q 1 and itself. In other words, X = . 3 Since X is clearly useless, Q 1 is clearly not the best question to ask.

40|$|As the {{coordinator}} of an MA-level industrial-organizational psychology graduate program, {{part of my}} (Michael Gasser) job is to develop internship opportunities for our students at area companies. Our program {{is located in a}} community of approximately 100, 000 people and the field of I-O psychology is simply not very well known by local business leaders (Gasser, Whitsett, Mosley, Sullivan, Rogers, & Tan, 1998). When meeting with a business leader to discuss internships, I am often asked to explain the difference between one of our students and someone with a comparable degree from a business school. This is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>question,</b> and although I have an answer, other I-O profes-sionals may not share my opinion. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine what distinguishes I-O psychology from academic training in business. In her 2003 SIOP presidential address, Ann Marie Ryan (2003) lamented the fact that industrial-organizational psychology is not very well known or understood. One solution she suggested was to change the name of industrial-organizational psychology to something that would be clearer and better received by business professionals. SIOP members voted on this issue in 2003 and our name remains unchanged. Although a name change may be beneficial in communicating with the business community and, in the least, a shorter name would be easier to say, the name change would not solve the broader problem of communicating about and advancing understanding of I-O psy-chology. Changing our name is irrelevant unless we market our profession, and we cannot carve out a market unless we have a clear understanding of our own identity. We must market our profession if others are going to understand what we do. We believe there are two relevant issues here: (a) How should we adver-tise I-O psychology? and (b) What should we say about ourselves?

40|$|Getting regular foods Cue: For any farmer, the {{quantity}} of what they produce and how well it?s stored will determine their food ? and income ? for the year. Production and storage is even more critical for farmers with HIV/AIDS. Weakened by illness, they need crops and farming methods that don?t {{require a lot of}} effort as well as effective storage to make sure they have good food all year round. Dodou Jallow ? who works for the Gambian Network of AIDS Support Societies ? is well aware of these challenges and talked with Ismaila Senghore about what farmers can do. IN:	?As most of the support? OUT:	?our forefathers were doing. ? DUR?N:	 3 ? 28 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: From Gambia that was Dodou Jallow. What traditional methods of storage can you tell us about? The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Jallow	As most of the support group members are rural farmers. That means we have to create income-generating activities from farming for them to be self sufficient. Ismaila	What kind of crops do you think people with HIV/AIDS can farm because they are usually people that lack energy, so maybe they would need to be advised on crops that are easy to grow and that are of course of high nutritive value. Jallow	We are very weak, so what type of farming we recommend to them is fruit tree farming, whereby you have a garden, after fencing the garden you have some fruit trees which if you plant them you don?t need to water them. Some drought tolerant trees like cashews, like mangoes, and so on, just have a fence, {{at the beginning of the}} rainy season you plant them and then just taking care you don?t need to water them. Ismaila	There are many ways of ensuring that food supplies are constant and regular throughout the year, that is by processing, preservation and storage of some of the perishable foods that maybe out of season. Do you think there is the possibility for your people to learn the skills that will help them ensure that later there will be a constant supply? Jallow	That is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>question.</b> I know that most of our yields became low due to poor storage facilities. So by processing, drying of these fruits like mangoes, you can process it and dry it so that it can stay for a long time. Ismaila	We know there are also some grains and other kinds of vegetables that may be easier to store than others. Do you have any choice about what kind of fruits and grains that you may envisage to store? Jallow	When you say grains really you have grains which are highly nutritious like maize, they are fast growing, high yielding and with proper care, with proper drying, they can store for a longer time. With just drying them at adequate moisture temperature you can store them. Ismaila	Now talking about storage, what kind of storage facilities would you recommend - the design? Jallow	Normally when the seed storage there is for the whole entire village, and we see what belongs to all belongs to nobody. So the type of storage facilities we would like to build is a sensible store that will be able to take care of our goods, and then we know that the store is for us and we will take care of it. Ismaila	Now how would a store be managed because you know there are possibilities of pest infestation. What kind of preservatives would you recommend for them to use? Jallow	With the local system that we were doing, our farmers have been preserving by using wood ash, even these neem trees and so on. We can do it and we will be able to preserve our commodities as long as we wish. Things that you know that they will be having so much pungent smell to drive insects out. You clean the store very well, and then let the commodity be dried well before you store it, let it have adequate temperature immediately before you store it and then you can use these local preservation methods that our forefathers were doing.

Trees that have been used and enjoyed by our people for generations are at risk. Some are dying out. Ferdinand Mushinge is the technical officer for Southern Africa Development Community, SADC. He encourages us to identify our favorites and to domesticate these wild trees by raising on our farms. A collection of fruit tree varieties ? and all their characteristics ? is a gene bank where the diversity is preserved. As he explained to Chris Kakunta, the trees on your land need to be nurtured just as tenderly as any other crop, or foreign, exotic trees. If not, then they will not thrive and the genetic treasure they hold could be lost forever. IN:	?We have been involved? OUT:	? they will have a regular harvest. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 21 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: The things you will need to get the best from your domesticated fruit trees were explained to Chris Kakunta by Ferdinand Mushinge, the technical officer for Southern Africa Development Community, SADC. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Mushinge	We have been involved in indigenous fruit trees because some were being heavily harvested for firewood. So genetic erosion was slowly creeping in. Future generation might not have such fruits in the future. So far I can say so good, these trees can be domesticated. That is what is initially required is, farmers can set up what we call community seed banks. The seed can be collected, processed and then planted out in what we call small nurseries and then re-grown in strategic areas. But one thing you should know when you talk about domestication. The trees should be grown in their natural ecological sites. Kakunta	When you talk of ecological sites what exactly do you mean? Mushinge	What I am trying to say when I say ecological sites, tree species, can only establish properly, they only flower and fruit properly in particular geographical areas which are adapted to certain climatic conditions which are conducive for them to flower and fruit. Kakunta	If the farmers have to choose an indigenous tree which they can domesticate, what factors do they have to follow? Mushinge	The factors which farmers have to follow if they have to domesticate a particular indigenous fruit tree is one the climatic factor, two the rainfall pattern, three the species of that wild fruit tree. Soil conditions are also important. For example I will give you a very common fruit tree which is very vital in agriculture, you will find it commonly in the markets but unfortunately it is slowly phasing out, you find {{that a lot of the}} trees have been cut. The example I am talking about is Uapaca Kirkiana which is commonly known as masuku. Very nice, very tasty but can be successfully grown. Kakunta	Wonderful, so what about in terms of the period under which the farmer can grow the tree and be able to get the fruits, don?t you think it matters as well? Mushinge	That is a very important point. If you talk about such trees like mango which is exotic, mango normally will flower and fruit after 3 to 4 years. And from there one aspect you have to consider is biennial bearing. Sometimes the fruit might not be too well because of maybe climatic factors, if the rainfall has not dropped very well the fruit might not flower and fruit very well. But a point in fact is if it is properly cultivated, that is such factors like proper fertilisation in fact even irrigate in terms of scarce rainfall periods you can even put in some water. As a matter of fact when you plant out these trees like the masuku you only need to establish it in the first year. In the next years or so you let nature run its course. Kakunta	Could you just tell us some steps towards cultivation of this particular tree? Mushinge	One, what is most important is tillage. For example the trees, when you plant them out in the field they have to be 4 by 4 metres apart. Two, they have to irrigated at least once per week. When I say irrigate them, irrigate them once per week with 15 to 20 litres of water, make sure that you apply some fertiliser, that is X or D compound and then you really should be applying it once per year as and when the need arises. Kakunta	Now in the absence of these chemical fertilisers would you recommend farmers to use manure for instance? Mushinge	That is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>question.</b> Manure behaves like fertiliser. The most important aspect one should consider is that it should properly decompose. Make sure that it decomposes properly but it is an excellent alternative to inorganic fertilisers. Kakunta	So once the farmer follows this procedure are they assured that these indigenous fruit trees can grow just like the exotic ones? Mushinge	When these plants follow out the proper agronomic procedures which I have stipulated after 3, 4 and 5 years depending on the species in question they will definitely have a continuous yield but a point in fact is management is very important. Exotic fruit trees need to be managed same as indigenous fruit trees, they can be domesticated, managed and they will have a regular harvest.

40|$|Cue: While it?s always {{possible}} for accidents {{to happen on}} a farm, especially when using heavy or sharp equipment, farming is not usually regarded as a very dangerous occupation. However, there are health risks that many farmers are not aware of. Chemical fertilizers and pesticides, for example, if handled or applied wrongly can cause serious illness. And for farmers who keep livestock {{there is also a}} risk of catching diseases from their animals. While the majority of animal diseases cannot be caught by humans, a few serious ones can. They are called zoonotic diseases, or zoonoses, and if they are not treated quickly they can prove fatal for human sufferers. Kwenkam Paul of Cameroon?s ministry responsible for livestock spoke to Martha Chindong about the dangers of zoonotic diseases and how farmers and veterinary technicians can reduce them. Martha started by asking him to give some examples of these diseases that farmers are at risk of catching from their livestock. IN:		?Thank you very much Martha ?? OUT:		??. This is very very important. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 52 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Kwenkam Paul describing how livestock farmers can prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Transcript Paul	Thank you very much Martha. There are so many diseases that affect both animals and humans, which we call zoonotic diseases, or zoonoses. There are many of them, it will depend on the animal species. For example in cattle, we have tuberculosis, we have brucelosis, these are examples. In poultry we have Newcastle to some extent. In pigs we have swine erysipelas etc. Chindong	Now doctor, from your experience among farmers and the farmers? communities, how are these diseases transmitted from animals to farmers? Paul	For example, like swine erysipelas, which is a very important zoonosis among our pig population. Now because farmers are always working with these pigs, it entails that if the pigs come down with erysipelas, the farmers are immediately exposed. Therefore, what do we tell farmers? We tell them that you should not handle your pigs when you have wounds on you body, because legions on the body are some of the principal routes of transmission of this disease. For example, in the recent past one of our technicians in the Douala region himself contracted erysipelas, by handling pigs, and he developed very severe fever, severe joint pains, and severe inflammation of the legs, and he had to be put under serious emergency treatment, if not his life was in great danger. Chindong	Now how can farmers properly manage their livestock in order to prevent infectious diseases, both for themselves and their animals? Paul	This is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>question.</b> The first thing, for example, is that farmers should work with the technicians. The technicians themselves should be well-informed, and they should be disposed to the farmers, they should understand their role in development, they should understand their role in fighting poverty. So when farmers work with technicians, the technicians will help them make sure they have good inputs, for example good breeding stock: good piglets or good day-old chicks, or good dairy animals. That implies that the animals must have good infrastructure; for example like the piggery. Before you plan a piggery somewhere, you must know that, whether other piggeries are within the area, and as much as possible you plan the piggery such that the other piggeries are not an immediate threat to that piggery. You make sure that you advise the farmers to construct modern piggeries. By ?modern piggeries? I mean some area, well-defined, where the animals are kept away from sun, from direct sunlight, and where they have adequate supply of water. And then you keep off all stray animals, all intruders be they humans, and then you advise the farmers not to visit other farms. Then the farmer to a large extent will reduce the chances of infectious diseases coming to his farm. But one other important thing is that you the technician yourself, you could bring disease to the farmer?s farm. So definitely you yourself the technician, you must make sure that you don?t visit two farms in a day, and {{if you are going to}} have meetings with farmers, it is better not to have meetings within the farm premises. You should probably have it in a neutral place, maybe a primary school or within a church area, and then you insist to farmers, you inform them that as much as possible, though working together, they should work as individuals. Chindong	Though working together they should work as individuals. What do you mean? Paul	By this I mean, actually I am addressing myself to pig farmers, considering the dangers of African swine fever. The emphasis for you, Martha, and myself, is that we try as much as possible to encourage farmers to work as a group, we try as much as possible to encourage them to have co-operatives. But for pig farmers, we are saying that the farmer should not go to other pig farms, he should not, he should not visit them. And even, when he goes for example to the pig market, he should not bring animals back to his farm, and once he comes back from the pig market he should not go to his farm. He should first of all have a good bath, all the dresses that he wore in the market, and his shoes, he must wash, clean them very very well. If not he will bring very virulent viruses or micro-organisms to his farm, and that will be plenty of trouble for him. Chindong	Now, let?s say farmers are already exposed to these diseases, what can they do? Paul	Yes if farmers are exposed to this problem, the first thing they should do is they have to go to the hospital; this is absolutely important, and this is the advice we give them, that once they feel sick they must go to the hospital. And when they go to the hospital, they should not hide telling the doctors what their occupation is, what their activities are. Because if they don?t tell the doctor, the doctor may take the fever for some ordinary fever, maybe for malaria fever. So now when they tell the doctor that they are livestock farmers, since the doctor is aware of the various zoonotic problems, then he will start by eliminating first of all those zoonotic problems before attacking the other problems. This is very very important. End of track.
