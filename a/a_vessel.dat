It also facilitated the Red Sea trade {{on which it}} thrived. The coinage has also proved invaluable in providing a reliable chronology of Aksumite kings {{due to the lack}} of extensive archaeological work in the area.|$|E
5|$|At 3400 ton, {{the vessel}} is argued to {{be a small}} frigate rather than a corvette, and poorly armed. It's also been alleged that the Indian Navy wanted <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> with the {{endurance}} of a 3400-ton frigate and an armament of a 1200-ton corvette.|$|E
50|$|Sea {{trials are}} {{conducted}} to measure <b>a</b> <b>vessel’s</b> performance and general seaworthiness. Testing of <b>a</b> <b>vessel’s</b> speed, maneuverability, equipment and safety features are usually conducted. Usually in attendance are technical {{representatives from the}} builder, governing and certification officials, {{and representatives of the}} owners. Successful sea trials subsequently lead to <b>a</b> <b>vessel’s</b> certification for commissioning and acceptance by its owner.|$|R

Considerations of every kind pointed to the inconvenience of acquiring such <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> and to the revision of the contract in the sense of reducing the tonnage. This was done, and we shall possess a powerful unit which will not be built on exaggerated lines such as have not as yet stood the time of experience.|$|E

Jeliffe replied that he intended to charge murder, piracy, and running away with <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> with intent to steal it. Vroom granted an adjournment until Tuesday at 11am. Jackalow was remanded to the city prison.|$|E

5|$|Five ships {{recorded}} {{tropical storm}} force winds {{in association with}} Arthur, of which two were when the storm was extratropical. Early on July 16, <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> with the call sign Weston reported sustained winds of 51mph (82km/h) from the south-southwest, which was the strongest ship reported wind speed. As the storm approached Canada as an extratropical storm, a buoy reported an 8minute average wind speed of 45mph (72km/h), along with a wind gust of 60mph (97km/h).|$|E

We also presented simple and efficient criteria to distinguish <b>a</b> primo <b>vessel</b> from <b>a</b> blood or <b>a</b> lymph <b>vessel</b> and from <b>a</b> nerve.

5|$|Following World War II, several {{searches}} {{of the waters}} around North Stradbroke and Moreton Islands failed to reveal Centaurs location. It was believed that she had sunk {{off the edge of}} the continental shelf, to a depth at which the Royal Australian Navy did not have the capability to search for <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> of Centaurs size. Some parties also believed that Rippon's calculated point of sinking was inaccurate, either intentionally or through error.|$|E
5|$|For a given tonnage, {{the second}} factor which governs the ship's {{dimensions}} {{is the size of}} the ports and waterways it will travel to. For example, <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> that will pass the Panama Canal will be limited in its beam and draft. For most designs, the ratio of length-to-width ranges between 5 and 7, with an average of 6.2. The ratio of length-to-height will be between 11 and 12.|$|E
5|$|Ghazi, meanwhile, sank off the Visakhapatnam coast under mysterious circumstances. On {{the night}} of 3–4 December, a muffled {{underwater}} explosion was detected by a coastal battery. The next morning, a local fisherman observed flotsam near the coast, causing Indian naval officials to suspect <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> had sunk off the coast. The next day, a clearance diving team was sent to search the area, and they confirmed that Ghazi had sunk in shallow waters.|$|E

5|$|In United States v. Gooding (1827), the Court {{construed}} {{the elements}} of the fitting out offense. First, the Court held that the offense of fitting out <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> for slave trading could be committed even if the owner of the vessel did not personally fit it out. Second, the Court held that the statute could be violated by a partial fitting out (as opposed to a complete fitting out) of <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> for that purpose. Third, the Court held thatsince slave trading was a misdemeanorthere was no distinction between principal and accessory. Fourth, the Court held that, for the statute to be violated, the fitting out must have occurred within the United States. Finally, the Court held that the statute's mens rea required that the owner intend to cause the vessel to be used for slave trading, as opposed to intending that the vessel be used for slave trading (by some third party).|$|E
5|$|On July21, <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> named Cape Horn relayed {{information}} regarding the storm to the National Weather Bureau, leading to them re-issuing advisories on the storm, upgrading it to a hurricane. The following day, a reconnaissance mission from Oahu, Hawaii located the storm's 40mi (65km) wide eye and recorded sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h) and gusts up to 115mph (185km/h). Shortly after, the storm likely attained its peak intensity as a high-end Category 1 hurricane, with winds of 85mph (140km/h). Early on July23, warning responsibility of the storm {{was given to the}} National Weather Bureau in Honolulu, Hawaii.|$|E
