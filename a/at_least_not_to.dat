5|$|In 1147 William fitzHerbert, the Archbishop of York, was deposed, {{and a new}} {{election}} for the archbishopric was ordered by Pope Eugenius III on 11 May 1147. The election took place on 24 July 1147 at Richmond rather than York, due to the opposition of William of Aumale, the Earl of York, who supported the ousted archbishop. Robert, along with Hugh de Puiset {{and some of the}} cathedral chapter, favoured Hilary, a canon lawyer. Most {{of the rest of the}} archdiocese's officials and the chapter favoured Henry Murdac. The disputed election was decided by the pope, who declared Murdac the new archbishop and gave the vacant bishopric of Chichester to Hilary. Murdac was consecrated by Eugenius on 7 December 1147, and Robert appears to have supported the new archbishop, or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have actively opposed him. But others among the cathedral chapter and suffragan bishops of York continued to actively agitate against Murdac, including refusing him entry to York for three years. Robert took little other part in the disputes at York during Murdac's archiepiscopate. Probably, it was Robert's involvement in secular office as chancellor that restricted his activities with his ecclesiastical office. Robert may have become a supporter of Murdac's during this time, as the archbishop addressed at least six confirmation grants to Robert.|$|E
25|$|Other {{theories}} suggest Donati's death resulted {{more directly}} from specific crimes {{he was engaged}} in.

Donati's FBI files also note that he had some large gambling debts at the time.|$|E
500|$|Finding the Persian fleet {{gone from}} Samos, the Allies were thrown into uncertainty. Eventually they {{resolved}} {{that they would}} sail to the mainland, and equipped themselves for a naval battle. However, when the Allies approached Mycale, the Persians {{did not attempt to}} engage them, and remained guarding their camp. Leotychides therefore sailed as close to the camp as possible, and had a herald make an appeal to the Ionians: [...] "Men of Ionia, you who hear us, understand what I say, for by no means will the Persians understand anything I charge you with when we join battle; first of all it is right for each man to remember his freedom and next the battle-cry Hebe: and let him who hears me tell him who has not heard it." [...] Herodotus suggests that the purpose of this message was twofold; firstly to encourage the Ionians, unbeknownst to the Persians, to fight for the Allies (or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> fight against them); or, if the message became known to the Persians, to make the Persians mistrust the Ionians.|$|E

500|$|Discussions with Russia on NATO {{concessions}} {{in return}} for Russian President Vladimir Putin's attendance had been underway for some months before the summit, and intensified as the summit date drew closer. On May 17, {{in the run-up to}} the NATO summit, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer indicated in a speech that Putin signalled that he might honor the summit with his presence if [...] "the conditions will be right". It is unclear what conditions were under discussion, but it is speculated that Putin's conditions included an enhanced Russian role in NATO decision-making through the NATO-Russia Council (NRC), NATO acceptance of Russia's continued military presence in Moldova and Georgia (the withdrawal of these troops was an obligation Russia had assumed at the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's (OSCE) 1999 Istanbul summit); a move of NATO members to ratify that same treaty and to place the three Baltic states, that joined NATO in March 2004, under military restrictions. As Putin did not receive satisfaction in discussions ahead of the NATO summit - <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> the extent that he hoped, he refused to attend the meeting. When NATO officials indicated that Putin would probably not attend the summit, Russia's Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov reacted on the same day (June 2) by stressing the importance that Moscow attaches to enhancing its role in NRC and that Russia had not declined the invitation to attend the NRC meeting. Due to the replacement of Putin by Lavrov, the meeting was not held at the level of the Heads of State and Government (as normally would be the case), but at the level of foreign ministers.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fifth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Balak took Balaam {{to the summit}} of Pisgah, once offered a bull and a ram on each of seven altars, and once again Balaam asked Balak to wait while Balaam went off alone to seek a manifestation, and once again God told him what to say. Balaam {{returned}} and told Balak: [...] "My message was to bless: When He blesses, I cannot reverse it. [...] No harm is in sight for Jacob, no woe in view for Israel.

2500|$|Thus the {{diaphragm}} emerges {{in the context}} of a body plan that separated an upper feeding compartment from a lower digestive tract, but the point at which it originates is a matter of definition. [...] Structures in fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds have been called diaphragms, but it has been argued that these structures are not homologous. [...] For instance, the alligator diaphragmaticus muscle does not insert on the esophagus and does not affect pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter. [...] The lungs are located in the abdominal compartment of amphibians and reptiles, so that contraction of {{the diaphragm}} expels air from the lungs rather than drawing it into them. [...] In birds and mammals, lungs are located above the diaphragm. [...] The presence of an exceptionally well-preserved fossil of Sinosauropteryx, with lungs located beneath the diaphragm as in crocodiles, has been used to argue that dinosaurs could not have sustained an active warm-blooded physiology, or that birds could not have evolved from dinosaurs. [...] An explanation for this (put forward in 1905), is that lungs originated beneath the diaphragm, but as the demands for respiration increased in warm-blooded birds and mammals, natural selection came to favor the parallel evolution of the herniation of the lungs from the abdominal cavity in both lineages. However, birds do not have diaphragms. [...] They do not breathe in the same way as mammals, and do not rely on creating a negative pressure in the thoracic cavity, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> the same extent. [...] They rely on a rocking motion of the keel of the sternum to create local areas of reduced pressure to supply thin, membranous airsacs cranially and caudally to the fixed-volume, non-expansive lungs. [...] A complicated system of valves and air sacs cycles air constantly over the absorption surfaces of the lungs so allowing maximal efficiency of gaseous exchange. [...] Thus, birds do not have the reciprocal tidal breathing flow of mammals. [...] On careful dissection, around eight air sacs can be clearly seen. [...] They extend quite far caudally into the abdomen.|$|E
