At present, a lot of advanced technologies, modern equipment and devices, which “recognizes” faulty axle-boxes when the train is in motion, have been implemented. However, the timely identification of breakdown <b>of</b> rolling stock <b>axle-boxes</b> still is an acute problem, the initial stage of damage emergence being especially problematic. Presently, rolling stock axle-box breakdown is determined according to the higher than permissible temperature <b>of</b> the <b>axle-box</b> body. The article provides statistical data <b>of</b> dangerously heated <b>axle-boxes,</b> determined train delay durations, the number of delayed trains by danger level, and dependence of damage on the season. After systematization <b>of</b> data on <b>axle-box</b> damage and heating temperatures <b>of</b> broken <b>axle-boxes,</b> heating tendencies <b>of</b> <b>axle-boxes</b> <b>of</b> freight wagons are described. Finally, basic conclusions are given...|$|R

The application of fuzzy systems methodology {{to the construction of}} fuzzy expert system for diagnostics of faults of axle boxes has allowed increasing adequacy of the diagnostics model <b>of</b> <b>axle-boxes</b> owing to the use of experience and intuitive knowledge of experts. The fuzzy expert system is able to simulate a course of reasoning of the expert and to explain its actions; also it removes a psychological barrier of misunderstanding in a process of interaction between the user and the system...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{variations in}} the temperature <b>of</b> <b>axle-box</b> heating <b>of</b> railroad rolling stock considering two modes of the train - driving and parking position. Additionally, the article describes {{the influence of the}} axle load and season on the heat <b>of</b> the <b>axle-box,</b> forecasts intolerable residual resources and explains a possibility of detecting likely breakage {{at the very beginning of}} defects. The paper also deals with scientific literature related to axle-box heating and focuses on the conducted practical and theoretical experiments. The carried out research has established the rates of operating heating and critical heating. The application of numerical values for the algorithm of automatic control devices could help with detecting the breakdowns <b>of</b> the <b>axle-box</b> before they reach a critical state and assist in forecasting residual operating resources...|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the heating process <b>of</b> the <b>axle-boxes</b> ofrolling stock when the train is in motion and {{discusses}} the forcesacting on the wheel-set when rolling stock moves along the trackcurves. The paper analyses scientific publications relevant tothe forces acting on the wheel-set of rolling stock and focuseson the axle-box heating process. The article also discusses theresults of theoretical studies on wheel-set forces that affect theheat exchange process <b>of</b> <b>axle-boxes</b> for a railway vehicle. Theresearch has determined a change in heating temperatures ofdifferent <b>axle-boxes</b> <b>of</b> rolling stock and reasons for their variationsand tendencies. The paper has estimated an effect of thetrain running along the track curves on the heating intensity ofthe axle-box. Finally, valid conclusions and recommendationshave been provided...|$|R
40|$|The {{failure of}} {{axle-bearing}} {{is one of}} the most common causes of derailments of railway vehicles which are usually accompanied by huge material damage and human casualties. Modern railways are working intensively on the development and implementation of appropriate systems for early detection of axlebearing malfunctions, which are typically manifested by increasing of its temperature. The most common approach is based on the use of wayside systems or checkpoints located in certain places along the track. There is also an innovative approach that involves using the system for continuous measuring and online monitoring <b>of</b> <b>axle-boxes</b> temperature. The main aim is to provide early detection of malfunctions of the axle-bearing and prevention of the potential derailment. This paper analyses the existing solutions for the detection of axle-bearings malfunctions with special emphasis on the working principle and the main advantages and disadvantages. The paper presents the basics of the one newly developed wireless measuring system for on-line monitoring <b>of</b> <b>axle-boxes</b> temperature. The measuring system was tested in real conditions and can be successfully applied to the commercial railway vehicles. The main conclusion is that systems for on-line monitoring of axle-bearings temperatures are far more efficient than wayside systems. Obtained results may be important for those who deal with these and similar problems, problems of development, exploitation and maintenance of railway vehicles, strategies, regulations, etc...|$|R
