Thanks to van Gogh's correspondence, it has been possible to identify the works he knew and admired. The exhibition will assemble {{as many as possible}} of these - for the most part masterpieces of art history - constituting, as it were, Vincent's musee imaginaire. His own paintings will reveal the artist in dialogue with those that he admired. The presence of great masters such as Rembrandt and Rubens, Constable, Corot and Courbet, Delacroix, Gauguin and Monet is in itself a powerful homage to Vincent's genius. The exhibition and the accompanying book will establish a visual contrast - or rather dialogue - between the work of van Gogh and the paintings which acted as his inspiration...|$|R
50|$|Released in May 1982, {{though with}} most of his {{employees}} still {{in prison for the}} crime Marks was found innocent of, he spent the next year running a legitimate wine importing business but he continued to spend more money than he was making and the savings he made from drug smuggling in the 1970s began to dwindle. In 1983, McCann was still at large and his smuggling enterprise was flourishing; he offered Marks the chance to sell 250 kilos of cannabis and Marks accepted. Dutch police confiscated the full shipment and arrested Mickey Williams, a member of the London underworld who had agreed to help Marks on the deal. Marks then travelled to the Far East to set up cannabis deals with Salim Malik, a Pakistani hashish exporter who he had met through Durrani (Durrani had since suffered a fatal heart attack) and Phil Sparrowhawk, an exporter from Bangkok; they would smuggle their product over to Ernie Combs in America. He also arranged a 500-kilo deal with Mickey Williams, who had travelled to Bangkok after his release from prison in <b>Amsterdam.</b> <b>Marks</b> laundered his money through various fronts: a travel agency, a paper mill, a wine importers, a bulk water transportation company and a secretarial service.|$|R

50|$|Kirwa {{established}} herself {{among the}} world's elite road runners {{in her late}} twenties. At the Azkoitia-Azpeitia Half Marathon in March 2012 she knocked almost two minutes off her personal best to win the race {{in a time of}} 68:39 minutes. This was the fastest time ever recorded in Spain over that distance. Heading to Brazil in May, she set a 10K best of 31:57 minutes. She made her debut over the full marathon distance in August that year, winning on her first attempt - her time of 2:33:42 hours in Asunción was the fastest ever on Paraguayan soil. The 2012 <b>Amsterdam</b> Marathon <b>marked</b> a significant breakthrough: in the top level marathon she kept pace with Meseret Hailu for most of the race and, after falling behind in their duel, she eventually finished in second place. Kirwa's time of 2:21:41 hours was quicker than the previous course record and ranked her 16th worldwide that year (by far her highest career ranking).|$|R

In 1907, seven of the larger growers and packers in the area merged to form the American Sumatra Tobacco Co., with a division in Amsterdam. This was a company town with offices, railroad, commissaries, post office, packing houses and employee houses. At its peak, the town boasted a population of 450. The Imperial Tobacco Co. bought the A. S. T. Co. in 1955 and operated it until 1965 when they discontinued growing tobacco. In 1967 the land was sold to the Coastal Lumber Company. 2 ̆ 2 [URL]...|$|R

5000|$|His work 'Lo Real/ Le Réel/ The Real' in 2013 was controversial: The {{standing}} ovation {{from the crowd}} that packed the Stasschouwburg in <b>Amsterdam,</b> was in <b>marked</b> contrast to the more conservative and hostile reaction to the premiere in Madrid. This was attributable to its treatment of a sensitive and emotive subject, the Nazi Holocaust against the gypsies. In addition, Galván’s performance was controversial, his body expressing the role {{in a sort of}} body art or actionism of the body with certain self-inflicted violence. He changed his physique for this show, continuing that Kafkaesque process he undertook some years before with 'La metamorfosis'. And he’s a victim of extermination. One who fights, who rebels, who swells with pride, who expresses his grief, who swears vengeance... but a victim who falls prey to death.|$|R

40|$|The essay {{looks at}} what the {{catchword}} of ‘internationalisation’ does {{to the practice of}} performance research, especially in terms of its pedagogical implications. If internationalisation is seen as the answer, what is the question? What demands does the addition of the qualifier ‘international’ pose to a Humanities department in a city like <b>Amsterdam,</b> historically <b>marked</b> as a global mercantile centre, with a knotted legacy of slavery and prosperity, of colonisation and liberal thought? Finally, what vision of the university could the discipline of Theatre Studies hope to offer, by way of this enticing and ambitious call for internationalisation? Beyond the critique of the financialisation of higher education that most universities and especially Humanities faculties around the world are facing, the essay offers hope generated from the classroom, based on the experiences of the MAIPR Programme from 2008 to 2013. The task that internationalisation confers upon the discipline of Theatre and Performance Studies is the task of thinking and doing beyond the myopic limitations of the national framework. Two aspects of internationalisation, as drawn from the experiences of the day-to-day work of teaching, working with students and co-operating with partner institutions, are charted here. The first aspect relates to the use of English as the language of internationalisation, and the insightful and vexing learning situations it generates. The second aspect reflects on how the idea of performance as epistemology translates into pedagogical practice. The essay pleas for a learning that combines embodiment, live experimentation and reflection, beyond the tired binary of theory and practice. The scope of ‘internationalisation’ of performance research lies in imagining it as a meta-vocational discipline...|$|R
5000|$|Together with Pieter Pietersz, Ketel was {{the leading}} portraitist in Amsterdam for many years, {{and one of the}} {{generation}} of Dutch portrait-painters whose increasingly sophisticated work laid the foundations for their much more famous successors. Whereas in England portraits in oils remained mostly confined to the court and gentry, in the Netherlands they were already common among the prosperous mercantile classes. Ketel lived near Oude Kerk, where he bought in 1593 a house on the so-called [...] "Velvet Canal". Both Ketel and Pietersz developed an <b>Amsterdam</b> style often <b>marked</b> by depicting sitters [...] "very close to the picture plane, from an unusual angle, and cropped closely by the frame" [...] (see Double Portrait of a Brother and Sister, below). Ketel seems to have kept a stock of drawings of poses, from which a patron might choose, and which could be worked up by studio assistants without the sitter's presence being required. Van Mander records that around 1600 he at times discarded his brush and painted directly with his fingers, and even developed the trick of painting with his feet and toes - presumably just for short periods. This may have been to amuse himself and his sitters, to relieve boredom. An alternative, perhaps more likely, explanation, is that he was forced to do so by a progressive paralysis, perhaps arthritic, which finally completely overcame him by 1610-1613.|$|R
50|$|In the UK {{there were}} engagements with Riccardo Muti, Sir Georg Solti, Lovro von Matačić, Giuseppe Sinopoli (appointed Principal Conductor of the Philharmonia Orchestra in 1984 {{and with whom}} the Chorus {{appeared}} in Parma and Taormina), Kurt Sanderling (including the Chorus' second recording of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony), Sir Andrew Davis, Seiji Ozawa, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Bernard Haitink, Charles Dutoit, and in 1980 the Chorus's first appearance at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden in a performance of Verdi’s Requiem at the Rudolf Kempe Memorial Concert. A second appearance in the same House six years later in Britten’s War Requiem with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir Simon Rattle was a Memorial Concert for Sir Peter Pears. These years also saw the Chorus appearing regularly in the UK outside London with notable visits to Cardiff, Brighton, Nottingham, Derby, Cheltenham, Cambridge and Aldeburgh. At Aldeburgh the Chorus gave the world première in 1985 of Britten's unfinished final composition Praise We Great Men, with the Philharmonia Orchestra under Mstislav Rostropovich, and three years later {{took part in a}} semi-staged performance of Britten's Paul Bunyan. Two years later in 1988 a particular honour was paid the Chorus: an invitation to perform in Mahler’s Eighth Symphony in <b>Amsterdam’s</b> Concertgebouw to <b>mark</b> the 100th Anniversary of the Concertgebouw Orchestra and concert hall, the hall’s re-opening after renovations, and Bernard Haitink’s last concerts as chief conductor of the Concertgebouw Orchestra.|$|R
