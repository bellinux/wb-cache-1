5|$|Jifna, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>most</b> of Palestine, was annexed by the Rashidun Caliphate under Umar ibn al-Khattab {{after the}} Battle of Ajnadayn in 634. The town became less {{politically}} significant under the Arab dynasties of the Umayyads, Abbasids and Fatimids, but remained a major regional center for trade and commerce, {{due to its}} location along the Jerusalem–Nazareth road. It was known by the Arabs as Gafeniyyah.|$|E

5|$|Some Muslim historians {{believe the}} site of the Battle of Ajnadayn between the Muslim Arabs and the Byzantines in 634 CE was at Lajjun. Following the Muslim victory, Lajjun, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>most</b> of Palestine, and {{southern}} Syria were incorporated into the Caliphate. According to medieval geographers Estakhri and Ibn Hawqal, Lajjun was the northernmost town of Jund Filastin (military district of Palestine).|$|E
5|$|<b>Along</b> <b>with</b> <b>most</b> of the Pleistocene megafauna, Smilodon became extinct 10,000 {{years ago}} in the Quaternary {{extinction}} event. Its extinction has been linked to the decline and extinction of large herbivores, which were replaced by smaller and more agile ones like deer. Hence, Smilodon could have been too specialized at hunting large prey and may have been unable to adapt. A 2012 study of Smilodon tooth wear found no evidence that they were limited by food resources. Other explanations include climate change and competition with humans (who entered the Americas around the time Smilodon disappeared), or a combination of several factors, all of which apply to the general Pleistocene extinction event, rather than specifically to the extinction of the saber-toothed cats.|$|E
5|$|<b>Along</b> <b>with</b> <b>most</b> of the Riverina region, the {{majority}} of Wagga Wagga residents supported the federation of the Australian colonies, in large {{part due to the}} prospect of free trade across colonial borders. In 1898, a group of residents promoted Wagga Wagga for consideration as the site of the future national capital due to its location equidistant from Sydney and Melbourne and its ample water supply. Despite the bid's lack of success, in the 1899 referendum Wagga Wagga residents voted strongly in favour of federation.|$|E

Outnumbered and overpowered, Boles's men were soon forced to seek refuge in the Church of St Lawrence, where they made a desperate last stand. Boles was killed, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>most</b> of his remaining men. The Parliamentarians won a clear victory, losing only a few men and taking many prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Between 1900 and 1940, fishers were {{threatened}} with near-extinction {{in the southern}} part of their range due to overtrapping and alterations to their habitat. In New England, fishers, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>most</b> other furbearers, were nearly exterminated due to unregulated trapping. Fishers became extirpated in many northern U.S. states after 1930, but were still abundant enough in Canada to maintain a harvest of over 3,000 fishers per year (see figure). Limited protection was afforded in the early 20th century, but it was not until 1934 that total protection was finally given to the few remaining fishers. Closed seasons, habitat recovery, and reintroductions have restored fishers to much of their original range.|$|E
5|$|Clarke {{composed}} no {{large scale}} {{works such as}} symphonies. Her total output of compositions comprises 52 songs, 11 choral works, 21 chamber pieces, the Piano Trio, and the Viola Sonata. Her work was all but forgotten {{for a long period}} of time, but interest in it was revived in 1976 following a radio broadcast in celebration of her ninetieth birthday. Over half of Clarke's compositions remain unpublished and in the personal possession of her heirs, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>most</b> of her writings. However, in the early 2000s more of her works were printed and recorded. Examples of recent publications include two string quartets and Morpheus, published in 2002.|$|E

5|$|However, {{losses were}} also high. Five of the {{fourteen}} Group commanders (Gruppenkommandeure) of II./JG 1 {{were killed in}} action while serving with II./JG 1. The notable losses were Oberleutnant Rohwer, and Hauptmanns Kijewski, Wickop, Seegatz and Dähne. During early 1944, prior to D-Day, II./JG 1 was led by one of its four experienced formation commanders. These were Hauptmann Segatz, Major Bär, and Oberleutnants von Kirchmayr and Eder. Yet the unit suffered heavy losses (<b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>most</b> other wings in the West) of 48 pilots killed, 23 wounded, and 158 aircraft destroyed for 164 confirmed victories.

5|$|Most Spanish Americans saw {{no reason}} to {{recognize}} a rump government that was under the threat of being captured by the French at any moment, and began to work for the creation of local juntas to preserve the region's independence from the French. Junta movements were successful in New Granada (Colombia), Venezuela, Chile and Río de la Plata (Argentina). Less successful, though serious movements, also occurred in Central America. Ultimately, Central America, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>most</b> of New Spain, Quito (Ecuador), Peru, Upper Peru (Bolivia), the Caribbean and the Philippine Islands remained in control of royalists for the next decade and participated in the Spanish Cortes effort to establish a liberal government for the Spanish Monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Rear Admiral David Porter. During {{the retreat}} down the Red River, Neosho was trapped above the falls at Alexandria, Louisiana, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>most</b> {{of the other}} ironclads of the Mississippi Squadron, when the river's water level {{unexpectedly}} began to fall. Two temporary dams, known as Bailey's Dam, had {{to be built in}} April–May to raise the water level high enough to allow the ironclads to proceed downstream. During the Franklin-Nashville Campaign in December 1864 Neosho, accompanied by the casemate ironclad , bombarded Confederate artillery batteries on the Cumberland River, near Bell's Mills, Tennessee, on 6 December. Despite being hit over 100 times, she was not seriously damaged. The monitor bombarded the Confederate right wing during the Battle of Nashville on 15–16 December.|$|E
5|$|Silver half dimes {{had been}} struck {{from the early days}} of the United States Mint in the late 18th century. Those {{disappeared}} from circulation, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>most</b> other coins, in the economic turmoil of the Civil War. In 1864, the Mint successfully introduced low-denomination coins, whose intrinsic worth did not approach their face value. Industrialist Joseph Wharton advocated coins containing nickel—a metal in which he had significant financial interests. When the Mint proposed a copper-nickel five-cent piece, Congress required that the coin be heavier than the Mint had suggested, allowing Wharton to sell more of the metal to the government.|$|E
