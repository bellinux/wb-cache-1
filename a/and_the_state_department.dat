5|$|Interviews with {{communities}} {{from both}} sides of the political divide indicate how Chávez is seen by the rich and poor. The latter support his stated aim to redistribute the country's oil wealth; the former fear totalitarianism and are worried Chávez will institute communism. In February 2002, the media war intensifies after Chavez takes control of PDVSA. The film states that the company was previously run as a private interest for the benefit of a minority, despite being state-owned. Business leader Pedro Carmona and union boss Carlos Ortega are the main voices of the opposition. After the pair visit Washington, D.C., the CIA <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Department</b> express concern about Chávez's rule and stress the importance of Venezuela's oil. A Venezuelan general appears on private television to voice similar disquiet. Carmona appeals for a public protest at the offices of PDVSA.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} Arévalo's {{presidency}} in 1951, Jacobo Árbenz {{was elected to the}} {{presidency in}} a landslide. The progressive military leader of 1944 continued Arévalo's reforms, and began an ambitious land-reform program, known as Decree 900. Under it, the uncultivated portions of large land-holdings were expropriated in return for compensation, and redistributed to poverty-stricken agricultural laborers. Approximately 500,000 people benefited from the decree. The majority of them were indigenous people, whose forebears had been dispossessed after the Spanish invasion. Árbenz' policies ran afoul of the United Fruit Company, which lost some of its uncultivated land. The company lobbied the US government for Árbenz' overthrow, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Department</b> responded by engineering a coup under the pretext that Árbenz was a communist. Carlos Castillo Armas took power {{at the head of a}} military junta, provoking the Guatemalan Civil War. The war lasted from 1960 to 1996, and saw the US-backed military commit genocide against the indigenous Maya peoples, and widespread human rights violations against civilians.|$|E

25|$|The CIA had {{different}} demands placed on {{it by the}} different bodies overseeing it.

Thus the two areas {{of responsibility for the}} CIA were covert action and covert intelligence. One of the main targets for intelligence gathering was the Soviet Union, which had also been a priority of the CIA's predecessors.|$|E

25|$|Given {{that the}} American plan for waging the Laotian Civil War was a {{defensive}} one, the American ambassador had {{run counter to}} policy by approving an offensive drive. This provoked a reaction from his superiors. The short notice request for additional USAF tactical air support had brought about a directive on 18 August that requests for tactical air support for a planned operation had to be submitted at least ten days in advance. In reality, the process would take 20 to 30 days. The directive, issued by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and agreed to by both the CIA <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Department,</b> required coordination of planned operations with both 7th Air Force and CINCPAC. These requirements were meant to limit offensives {{under the guise of}} coordination.|$|E
25|$|Former President Herbert Hoover was {{chairman}} of the 12-member bipartisan Congressional Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch, which was established prior to the passage of the National Security Act of 1947. As part of the Commission, the Task Force on National Security Organization (led by Ferdinand Eberstadt) examined the effectiveness of the intelligence agencies and reviewed federal bureaucracy. After a series of hearings, the Hoover Commission submitted a 121-page report written by Eberstadt's task force on January 13, 1949. The Eberstadt Report found that the National Security Act of 1947 soundly constructed the national security organization; however there remained organizational and qualitative inadequacies in national intelligence and the Central Intelligence Agency. The report's biggest criticism concerned the lack of coordination efforts between the CIA, the military, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Department</b> that resulted in duplication efforts, and subjective and biased intelligence estimates.|$|E
25|$|Bangladeshi {{authorities}} {{claim that}} as many as 3 million people were killed, although the Hamoodur Rahman Commission, the official Pakistani government investigation, put the figure as low as 26,000 civilian casualties. The figure of 3 million has become embedded in Bangladeshi culture and literature. The 'million' figure is attributed to the vernacular 'lakh' becoming mistranslated in Western media, thus increasing the casualty figure ten-fold. Serajur Rahman, the Deputy Head of the BBC Bengal service, attributes this mistranslation to a verbal gaffe by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at Heathrow Airport; Sayyid A. Karim, Bangladesh’s first foreign secretary alleges that the source of the figure was Pravda, the news-arm of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Independent researchers have estimated the death toll to be around 300,000 to 500,000 people while others estimate the casualty figure to be 3 million. The United States intelligence agency, the CIA <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Department</b> estimated that 200,000 people had been killed in the genocide.|$|E
