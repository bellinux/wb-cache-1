We study two tests proposed by Varian (1985) and de Peretti (2004), which test GARP within an explicit stochastic framework. Both tests compute <b>adjusted</b> <b>quantity</b> data that are compliant with GARP. We compare and contrast the two tests in theoretical terms and in an empirical application.

40|$|Accurate {{knowledge}} of the single-molecule (self) translational dynamics of liquid para-H 2 is an essential requirement for the calculation of the neutron scattering properties of this important quantum liquid. We show that, by using Centroid Molecular Dynamics (CMD) quantum simulations of the velocity autocorrelation function, calculations of the total neutron cross section (TCS) remarkably agree with experimental data at the thermal and epithermal incident neutron energies where para-H 2 dynamics is actually dominated by the self contributions. This result shows that a proper account of the quantum nature of the fluid, as provided by CMD, is a necessary and very effective condition to obtain the correct absolute-scale cross section values directly from first-principle computations of the double differential cross section, and without the need of introducing any empirically <b>adjusted</b> <b>quantity.</b> At subthermal incident energies, appropriate modeling of the para-H 2 intermolecular (distinct) dynamics also becomes crucial, but quantum simulations are not yet {{able to cope with}} it. Existing simple models which account for the distinct part provide an appropriate correction of self-only calculations and bring the computed results in reasonable accord with TCS experimental data available until very recently. However, if just published cross section measurements in the cold range are considered, the agreement turns out to be by far superior and very satisfactory. The possible origin of slight residual differences will be commented and suggest further computational and experimental efforts. Nonetheless, the ability to reproduce the total cross section in the wide range between 1 and 900 meV represents an encouraging and important validation step of the CMD method and of the present simple algorithm...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} argued that aggregate-supply/aggregate-demand (AS/AD) models suffer from an {{inconsistency}} because they assume that firms set price and <b>adjust</b> <b>quantity</b> for the AD curve and are profit-maximizing price takers for the AS curve.

Yet, to date, no studies have attempted to either analytically model this situation or practically characterize its implications in terms of ‘learning’. We consider a newsvendor setting where information available to managers {{is reflected in the}} form of a signal that may or may not be correct, and which may or may not be trusted. We show the analytical equivalence of <b>adjusting</b> an order <b>quantity</b> and deriving an entirely new one in light of a necessary update of the estimated demand distribution. Further, we assess the system’s behavior through a simulation experiment on theoretically generated data and we study how to foster learning to efficiently utilize managerial information. Judgmental adjustments are found to be beneficial even when the probability of a correct signal is not known. More generally, some interesting insights emerge into the practice of judgmentally <b>adjusting</b> order <b>quantities...</b>|$|R
30|$|ZnO {{nanostructures}} were manipulated, via a low-temperature solution process, from pure nanorod arrays {{to complex}} nanostructures of microflowers on nanorod arrays with <b>adjusted</b> <b>quantities</b> of flowers. We proposed {{the mechanism of}} local dissolution-driven growth to rationally discuss the novel growth process. These nanostructures were used as photoanodes in dye-sensitized solar cells. Compared to pure nanorod arrays, the nanorod array-microflower hierarchical structures improved the power conversion efficiency from 0.41 % to 0.92 %, corresponding to a 124 % efficiency increase. The enhancement of the efficiency was mainly ascribed to the synergistic effect of the enhanced surface area for higher dye loading and the improved light harvesting from efficient light scattering. Present results provide a promising route to improve the capability of light-harvesting for ZnO nanorod array-based DSSCs.|$|R

40|$|A {{dominant}} {{explanation of}} price rigidity {{is the so-called}} "menu cost model" according to which small costs of changing prices may imply that firms keep nominal prices unchanged to nominal shocks which therefore have real effects. Crucial to this explanation {{is the assumption that}} price adjustment is costly while quantity adjustment is not. This paper analyses the role of costs of adjusting both prices and quantities, and it is found that the "small cost" argument used to support menu cost models does not hold. The predictions of menu cost models only hold if price adjustment costs are larger than quantity adjustment costs. Empirical evidence clearly indicates that the costs of <b>adjusting</b> <b>quantities</b> are non-trivial. Quantity adjustment costs also open for the possibility of non-market clearing.

30|$|We {{present a}} highly {{efficient}} and pure light harvesting strategy by fabricating novel composite nanostructured photoanodes {{to improve the}} energy conversion efficiency of DSSCs. The ZnO nanostructures were manipulated from pure nanorod arrays to composite nanostructures of microflowers on nanorod arrays with <b>adjusted</b> <b>quantities</b> of flowers. The plausible mechanism of local dissolution-driven growth was proposed. Such composite nanostructures were then exploited as photoanodes of DSSCs to yield largely enhanced efficiency of 0.92 %, as compared to a low efficiency of 0.41 % for the DSSCs prepared by using a pure ZnO nanorod array, corresponding to a 124 % efficiency increase. The improved performance is {{a direct consequence of}} the synergistic effect of the enhanced surface area for higher dye loading, the improved light harvesting from efficient light scattering, as well as the fast carrier transport facilitated by continuous growth between microflowers and nanorods. From present results, the conversion efficiency of ZnO-based DSSCs can be further improved by constructing more complex nanostructures in the future.|$|R

40|$|Firms need {{to incur}} {{substantial}} sunk costs {{to break in}} foreign markets, yet many give up exporting shortly after their first experience, which often involves very small sales. Conversely, other new exporters shoot up their foreign sales and expand to new destinations. We investigate a simple theoretical mechanism that can rationalize these patterns. A firm discovers its profitability as exporter only after actually engaging in exporting. The profitability is positively correlated over time and across destinations. Accordingly, once the firm learns how good it is as an exporter, it <b>adjusts</b> <b>quantities</b> and decides whether to exit and whether to serve new destinations. Thus, it {{is the possibility of}} profitable expansion at both the intensive and extensive margins what makes incurring the sunk costs to enter a single foreign market worthwhile despite the high failure rates. Using a census of Argentinean firm-level manufacturing exports from 2002 to 2007, we find empirical support for several implications of our proposed mechanism, indicating that the practice of “sequential exporting ” is pervasive. Sequential exporting has broad and subtle implications for trade policy. For example, a reduction in trade barriers in a country has delayed entry effects in its own market, while also promoting entry in other markets. This trade policy externality poses challenges for the quantification of the effects of trade liberalization programs, while suggesting an entirely novel rationale for the negotiation of international trade agreements...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a price and {{quantity}} adjustment process in continuous time is considered for an economy with production factors and nal goods. We assume that each nal good {{is produced by}} a constant returns to scale production technology with only factor goods as inputs. The price and quantity adjustments {{take place on the}} markets for factor goods only. During the process, the prices in the nal good markets adjust instantaneously by setting the price of a nal good equal to the production costs. Pro-duction adjusts instantaneously to meet the demand and keeping the output markets in equilibrium. The adjustment process consists of three consecutive parts. First, in the short run part of the process the factor prices are assumed to be rigid and only quantity adjustments take place until an out of equilibrium situation is reached in which on each market either equilibrium under supply rationing prevails or excess demand and no supply rationing is observed. Next, in the mid run the factor prices are adjusted upwards in markets with excess demand, while on the other factor markets the supply rationing is adjusted to keep them in equilibrium. This process of <b>adjusting</b> <b>quantity</b> constraints in factor markets with excess supply and prices on factor markets with excess demands is shown to lead to a supply constrained equilibrium. Thirdly, in the long run the factor prices in markets with supply constraints are decreased, whereas supply constraints and prices in all other factor markets adjust to keep those markets in equilibrium.
