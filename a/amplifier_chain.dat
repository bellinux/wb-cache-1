50|$|This {{explains}} why {{the quality of a}} preamplifier or RF amplifier is of particular importance in an <b>amplifier</b> <b>chain.</b> In most cases only the noise figure of the first stage need be considered. However one must check that the noise figure of the second stage is not so high (or that the gain of the first stage is so low) that there is SNR degradation due to the second stage anyway. That will be a concern if the noise figure of the first stage plus that stage's gain (in decibels) is not much greater than the noise figure of the second stage.|$|E
50|$|The gain of a MCP is very noisy, {{especially}} for single particles. With two thick MCPs (>1 mm) and small channels (< 10 µm), saturation occurs, {{especially at the}} ends of the channels after many electron multiplications have taken place. The last stages of the following semiconductor <b>amplifier</b> <b>chain</b> also go into saturation. A pulse of varying length, but stable height and a low jitter leading edge is sent to the time to digital converter. The jitter can be further reduced by means of a constant fraction discriminator. That means that MCP and the preamplifier are used in the linear region (space charge negligible) and the pulse shape is assumed to be due to an impulse response with variable height but fixed shape from a single particle.|$|E
5000|$|Therefore, the <b>amplifier</b> <b>chain</b> can be {{modelled}} as a {{black box}} having a gain of [...] and a noise figure given by [...] In the usual case where the gains of the amplifier's stages are much greater than one, then {{it can be seen}} that the noise temperatures of the earlier stages have a much greater influence on the resulting noise temperature than those later in the chain. One can appreciate that the noise introduced by the first stage, for instance, is amplified by all of the stages whereas the noise introduced by later stages undergoes lesser amplification. Another way of looking at it is that the signal applied to a later stage already has a high noise level, due to amplification of noise by the previous stages, so that the noise contribution of that stage to that already amplified signal is of less significance.|$|E

50|$|In {{low level}} {{modulation}} a small audio stage {{is used to}} modulate a low power stage. The output of this stage is then amplified using a linear RF amplifier. The great disadvantage of this system is that the <b>amplifier</b> <b>chain</b> is less efficient, because {{it has to be}} linear to preserve the modulation. Hence high efficiency class C amplifiers cannot be employed, unless a Doherty amplifier, EER (Envelope Elimination and Restoration) or other methods of predistortion or negative feedback are used. High level modulation uses class C amplifiers in a broadcast AM transmitter and only the final stage or final two stages are modulated, and all the earlier stages can be driven at a constant level. When modulation is applied to the plate of the final tube, a large audio amplifier is needed for the modulation stage, equal to 1/2 of the DC input power of the modulated stage. Traditionally the modulation is applied using a large audio transformer. However many different circuits have been used for high level AM modulation. See Amplitude Modulation.|$|E

The first subsystem in the PAM prototype is a diode pumped, Nd:glass, linear, TEM{sub 00 }, 4. 5 m long regenerative amplifier cavity. With a single diode pumped head, we amplify a 1 nJ, mode matched, temporally shaped ({approx} 20 ns) seed pulse by a factor of approximately 10 {sup 7 } to 20 mJ.

40|$|Glass fusion laser systems {{typically}} use {{a master}} oscillator-power amplifier (MOPA) architecture, where {{control of the}} optical pulse temporal and spatial parameters is accomplished mainly in the master oscillator and low power optics. The pulses from this low power ``front end`` are amplified in the power amplifier, which modifies the pulse shape temporally and spatially. Nonlinear frequency conversion crystals following the amplifier further change the pulse before it reaches the target. To effectively control the optical pulse on target for different types of experiments, and compensate for nonlinearity in the preceding optics, the front end system must be versatile enough to easily control many pulse parameters over a large range. The front end pulse generation system {{described in this article}} represents a new approach to this problem. The proposed National Ignition Facility (NIF) has 192 beamlines, each of which requires an input pulse of up to 12 Joules in around 4 ns equivalent square pulse length.
