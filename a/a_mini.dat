5|$|In Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Observatory issued standby signal No. 1 as Soudelor {{neared the}} region on July11.

The signal was lowered back to No. 1 later that day before they were all canceled early on July12. The emergency response system was put at level four water-disaster in preparation for torrential rainfall from Soudelor. A red alert was also declared for the affected regions. Torrential rains in Hainan caused significant flooding that killed 15 hikers and left several others missing. Numerous roads were also cut off or destroyed by landslides and 30 villages were inundated with flood waters. In Hong Kong, outer bands of Soudelor produced squally rain showers on July11.

Palisades Toys used its likeness to create a posable action figure (packaged with a base and equipable rocket launcher) and <b>a</b> <b>mini</b> bust, which were released alongside several other Resident Evil-based merchandise. Moby Dick released its own line of Resident Evil action figures bundled in pairs of a playable character and enemy.

The electric cooperative serves a total of 21,097 house connections. Romblon Electric Cooperative (ROMELCO) supplies the capital town of Romblon through a 1.720 MW diesel power plant and a 1.30 MW power barge.
