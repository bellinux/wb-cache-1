40|$|Glibenclamide(GLI) {{is widely}} used as an oral hypoglycemic drug in the {{treatment}} of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). We investigated The enhancing eŠect of switching iontophoresis on the transdermal absorption and reduction of skin irritation to develop a transdermal dosage form of GLI. The 0. 1 ％ of Gli suspensions in 0. 2 M tris-HCl buŠer of pH 7. 4, 8. 0 and 8. 5 were prepared as donor solutions. We examined drug permeation through the excised rat abdominal skin, drug absorption in rats and reduction of skin irritation after application of switching iontophoresis for 1 h using DC 10 V. The solubility of GLI in 0. 2 M tris-HCl buŠer increased with a rise in pH. In the permeation study, GLI was permeated continuously and the cumulative amount of permeated GLI increased using an <b>alkaline</b> <b>donor</b> solu-tion. In the drug absorption study, the application group of pH 8. 5 gave higher plasma concentration levels than those of pH 7. 4 and 8. 0 groups. The skin irritation evoked by the application of iontophoresis was pathologically studied. A total irritation score (TIS) was estimated as a judging standard for the skin damage. The TIS value increased dependent-ly with a rise in pH. However, it was considered that the skin irritations were not serious and small matters. The results demonstrate the possibility of iontophoretic transdermal administration of GLI and the eŠect of drug solubility in the donor solution on the absorption of GLI...|$|E
40|$|A hollow-fibre {{supported}} {{liquid membrane}} (HF-SLM) extraction method {{has been developed}} for determination of 11 heterocyclic aromatic amines (HCAs) in human urine samples by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with an ultraviolet (UV) absorbance detector. These compounds were extracted from an <b>alkaline</b> urine sample (<b>donor</b> phase) into the organic solvent residing in the pores of a polypropylene hollow fibre and then back extracted into an acidic solution (acceptor phase) inside the lumen of the hollow fibre. After extraction, HCAs were analyzed by injecting the analyte enriched acceptor phase into the HPLC. The analyte enrichment factors ranged between 241 and 339 obtained in a 90 min extraction time, and method detection limits (MDL) ranged between 0. 1 and 0. 5 mugL(- 1) with relative standard deviation (RSD) values between 3. 4 % and 11 %. The extraction technique employed in this work is {{easy to use and}} rapid as it involves only a few minutes manipulation of each sample. It is the most economical sample preparation/preconcentration technique to our knowledge as compared to other microextraction techniques...|$|R
