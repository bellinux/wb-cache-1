In accordance with the legal provisions, the <b>audited</b> <b>entities</b> must notify, in case they meet the legal requirements, if they contract financial audit jobs. The processed information refers to the connection of the management’s nature and the source of the capital for these entities with the frequency of the changes occurred {{in the structure of the}} entity and/or of the social capital. Operations of such nature, considered for the period 2005 - 2012, refer on one side to absorption mergers, dissolutions without liquidation followed by merger, partial divisions and transfer of the <b>audited</b> <b>entity’s</b> headquarters in other counties (positive operations) and on the other side to operations of liquidation, insolvency, dissolution followed by liquidation, temporary suspension of activity for a maximum period of 3 years (negative operations). Positive operations are considered by authors to have as an impact the optimization of the indicators of financial position and/or performance, and the negative operations as those unlikely to meet the principle of activity continuity. The study aims to determine whether there is a correlation between a certain type of corporate governance on one side and the frequency of the two categories of changes in the structure of the activity and/or of the social capital. Conclusions are relevant for at least two reasons: the study is exhaustive, there have been taken into consideration all the <b>audited</b> <b>entities</b> in the county of Cluj and, moreover, the analyzed period is very expansive (the last seven financial years).

Our article aims to study audit sampling in audit of financial statements. As an audit technique largely used, in both its statistical and nonstatistical form, the method {{is very important for}} auditors. It should be applied correctly for a fair view of financial statements, to satisfy the needs of all financial users. In order to be applied correctly the method must be understood by all its users and mainly by auditors. Otherwise the risk of not applying it correctly would cause loose of reputation and discredit, litigations and even prison. Since there is not a unitary practice and methodology for applying the technique, the risk of incorrectly applying it is pretty high. The SWOT analysis is a technique used that shows the advantages, disadvantages, threats and opportunities. We applied SWOT analysis in studying the sampling method, from the perspective of three players: the audit company, the <b>audited</b> <b>entity</b> and users of financial statements. The study shows that by applying the sampling method the audit company and the <b>audited</b> <b>entity</b> both save time, effort and money.
