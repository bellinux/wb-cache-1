40|$|This paper proposes the {{application}} of time and spatial partition heating to a solar water heating system. The heating effect and system performance were analyzed under the continuous and whole space heating and time and spatial partition heating using TRNSYS. The results were validated by comparing with the test results of the demonstration building. Compared to continuous and whole space heating, the use of time and spatial partition heating increases the solar fraction by 16. 5 %, reduces the auxiliary heating by 7390 MJ, and reduces the annual operation cost by 2010 RMB. Under time and spatial partition heating, optimization analyses were conducted for the two system capacity parameters of the solar collector area and tank volume and the one operation parameter of auxiliary heater setting outlet temperature. The results showed that a reasonable choice of the solar collector area can reduce the dynamic annual cost, the increased tank volume is advantageous to heat storage, and the auxiliary heater setting outlet temperature have greater influence on the indoor heating effect. The <b>advanced</b> <b>opening</b> of solar water heating system and the normal opening of passive air vents are recommended. Based on the comparison of the two modes, the time and spatial partition heating technology is a better choice for rural dwellings...|$|E

Facing all these informational projects which are built all over the country, each science and research institution {{which is in the}} frontier in this field, should take it as a task of top priority to set up themselves campus and institution computer network. The build of the network of the China Agriculture Science Institution is brought up in this atmosphere. Chapter II, at first raise an article from the build of the institution, explain several important problems which encountered in the process of the backbone construction. They are the congestion in backbone, the choice of the backbone topology, the division of the VLAN etc. And then introduce construction distributing system and some aspects that strict the WAN communication. At last discuss how to choice the network equipment and server equipment. Chapter III, according to standards for building network that include practical, <b>advanced,</b> <b>opening,</b> compatibility, good performance, economical and security, and associate with the need of the China Agriculture Science Institution network, give detailed discussion of Fast Ethernet design and Fast Ethernet enhanced design, and then put forward the practical plan for network center, network backbone node, network common user node, backbone transmission media and distributing line in construction. Finally discuss subnet division, communicate within network management and security policy. Chapter IV, give a system evaluation for the proceeding design. Chapter V, introduce a following problem after the China Agriculture Science Institution network had been built, the design of the country agriculture business automation and share information proposal, according to the present situation of the distribution and the fare of domestic communicate network, give different system resolve design for different agriculture node. The build of China Agriculture Science Institution network and the design of the country agriculture business automation and share information proposal have already provided and will provide much broader research field and much rapidly information communicate.

The earlier amniotes of the Carboniferous did not have temporal fenestrae but two more advanced lines did: the synapsids (mammal-like reptiles) and the diapsids (most reptiles and later birds). As time progressed, diapsids' and synapsids' temporal fenestrae became more modified and larger to make stronger bites and more jaw muscles. Dinosaurs, which are diapsids, have large <b>advanced</b> <b>openings,</b> and their descendants, the birds, have temporal fenestrae which have been modified. Mammals, which are synapsids, possess no fenestral openings in the skull, as the trait has been modified.

By the mid hours, the mouth primordia were partly gaped opened. The late hours of the second day recorded the mouth ajar, raised epicanthic fold of the eyes, increase in appendage barbell length and development in alimentary system. Rapid development of the mouth and jaw primordia was noticed. These developments gradually led to the forward uplift of the head that was protruded anterio-dorsally upwards thereby separating it away from the yolk sac. The cartilage development in the jaw was significant leading to more <b>advance</b> <b>opening</b> of the mouth.
