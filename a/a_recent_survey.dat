5|$|Antarctica {{is home to}} {{more than}} 70 lakes that lie {{at the base of the}} {{continental}} ice sheet. Lake Vostok, discovered beneath Russia's Vostok Station in 1996, is the largest of these subglacial lakes. It was once believed that the lake had been sealed off for 500,000 to one million years but <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>survey</b> suggests that, every so often, there are large flows of water from one lake to another.|$|E
5|$|In April 2012, the WWF and International Rhino Foundation added 120 {{video cameras}} to the {{existing}} 40 to better monitor rhino movements and judge {{the size of the}} animals' population. <b>A</b> <b>recent</b> <b>survey</b> has found far fewer females than males. Only four females among 17 rhinos were recorded in the eastern half of Ujung Kulon, which is a potential setback in efforts to save the species.|$|E

5|$|Although the Auburn Dam is now mostly {{considered}} history, {{there are}} still proponents and groups devoted to restarting the long-inactive project. Advocates argue that the construction of Auburn {{would be the only}} solution for providing much-needed flood protection to the Sacramento area; that millions of dollars have already been spent making preparations; that it would provide an abundant supply of reliable water and hydroelectricity; and also that the recreational areas lost under the reservoir could be rebuilt around it. A major supporter of the revival of the dam is the Sacramento County Taxpayer's League; <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>survey</b> revealed that up to two-thirds of Sacramento citizens support construction of the Auburn. They also argue that the dam would only cost $2.6 billion instead of $6–10 billion, and that it is the cheapest alternative to provide flood control for the American River.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>recent</b> {{comprehensive}} <b>survey</b> of microbial genome sequence {{data indicated}} {{up to ten}} different metabolic functions encapsulated by BMC shells. The majority are involved in either carbon fixation (carboxysomes) or aldehyde oxidation (metabolosomes).|$|R
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>recent</b> <b>survey</b> {{from the}} Ohio Association of Independent Title Agents (OAITA), {{conducted}} from 2009 through 2010, showed when homebuyers are made {{fully aware of}} ABAs, they become uncomfortable and prefer a title company or title agent to be a third party (i.e., independent) to the transaction.|$|E
25|$|Also of note is {{that there}} are many more people who {{identify}} as UU on surveys than those who attend UU churches (by a factor of four in <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>survey),</b> reflecting those who have never joined (and lapsed members) but nonetheless consider themselves part of the UU movement.|$|E
25|$|Another {{case was}} <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>survey</b> of the Hong Kong media {{conducted}} by the Chinese University of Hong Kong School of Journalism and Communication, which placed RTHK in first place amongst electronic media in terms of credibility. RTHK achieved second place overall when all the local newspapers and magazines were included.|$|E
50|$|It is {{only known}} from museum {{specimens}} that were collected about 20 years ago. Since then the cave {{system has been}} flooded because of <b>a</b> dam. <b>Recent</b> <b>surveys</b> {{have not been able}} to relocate the species and it might be extinct.|$|R
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>recent</b> 2009 <b>survey</b> {{has shown}} that compatibilism is quite a popular stance among those who {{specialize}} in philosophy (59%). Belief in libertarianism amounted to 13.7%. More than a half of surveyed people were US Americans.|$|R

25|$|UCSB {{is known}} for its {{extensive}} biking system. <b>A</b> <b>recent</b> <b>survey</b> says that 53 percent of UCSB students get around by cycling. Bicycles have exclusive right of way on a series of specifically designated paths throughout East Campus. Bicycle stands and lockers are ubiquitous. UCSB is unique among bicycle-heavy areas in that most travel is done within a small radius.|$|E
25|$|Some {{influence}} {{on this story}} comes from travelling shows of the late 18th and early 19th centuries starring mechanical automatons. This field of entertainment has been under-documented, but <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>survey</b> of the field is contained in The Mechanical Turk by Tom Standage (2002). These shows were later to also influence Charles Babbage in his invention of the difference engine.|$|E
50|$|However, it is {{unlikely}} that this high Muslim TFR has continued since then in Macedonia, as Balkan Muslim fertility elsewhere (Albania, Bosnia, and Kosovo) has dropped sharply toward the European average. <b>A</b> more <b>recent</b> <b>survey</b> pegs Muslim fertility in Macedonia at 1.7, versus 1.5 for non-Muslims.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the leper colony on Brei Holm {{there may have been}} another at Hilla Fielle overlooking Hamna Voe. <b>A</b> <b>recent</b> archaeological <b>survey</b> was inconclusive but suggests the site may be much older than the supposed 18th century colony.|$|R

25|$|Individuals with FXS are at {{a higher}} risk of {{developing}} seizures, with rates between 10% and 40% reported in the literature. In larger study populations the frequency varies between 13% and 18%, consistent with <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>survey</b> of caregivers which found that 14% of males and 6% of females experienced seizures. The seizures tend to be partial, are generally not frequent, and are amenable to treatment with medication.|$|E
25|$|Many {{companies}} rely primarily upon manual {{methods for}} {{tasks such as}} developing SKU, location and channel forecasts. For instance, <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>survey</b> by Aberdeen Group showed that 78 percent of companies used Microsoft Excel spreadsheets as their primary demand modeling tool for trade promotions. Manual methods also involve time constraints that place limitations {{on the number of}} data streams that can be incorporated into the forecast, which therefore limits forecasting accuracy.|$|E
25|$|This dolphin used {{to exist}} in large schools near to urban centres in both the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers, but is now seriously {{threatened}} by pollution and dam construction.
