5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{attempts}} to make everyone's Christmas wishes come true. At a conference meeting, he vows to keep his promise to make wishes and asks the office members to also be nice to his new girlfriend Jessica (Eleanor Seigler). An emotionally confused Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) tries {{to be nice to}} Jessica, but ends up drinking too much at the party. In a drunken stupor, she tells Andy that her Christmas wish is for Jessica to die. Offended, he tells her to get over their breakup before storming off. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) does her part as a friend of Erin's by being mean to Jessica. Andy becomes concerned about Erin's behavior, not least because Robert California (James Spader) has revealed that his marriage is ending, spends {{a good deal of the}} party hanging out with Erin and pressures her into drinking shots. When Andy has to drive a drunken Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) home, he sees Erin getting into Robert's car and he follows them with a look of panic on his face. However, he covertly witnesses Robert being a gentleman and sending Erin off to her apartment with a hug and words of encouragement. Andy subsequently drives away with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
25|$|Brady's first {{witnesses}} {{during the}} trial included Betty Campbell, a model, who attended the September 5 party and testified that she saw Arbuckle with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> hours after the alleged rape occurred; Grace Hultson, a local hospital nurse who testified it was very likely that Arbuckle raped Rappe and bruised her body in the process; and Dr. Edward Heinrich, a local criminologist who claimed he found Arbuckle's fingerprints smeared with Rappe's blood on room 1219's bathroom door. Dr. Arthur Beardslee, the hotel doctor who had examined Rappe, testified that an external force seemed to have damaged the bladder. During cross-examination, Betty Campbell, however, revealed that Brady threatened to charge her with perjury {{if she did not}} testify against Arbuckle. Dr. Heinrich's claim to have found fingerprints was cast into doubt after McNab produced the St. Francis hotel maid, who testified that she had cleaned the room before the investigation even took place and did not find any blood on the bathroom door. Dr. Beardslee admitted that Rappe had never mentioned being assaulted while he was treating her. McNab was furthermore able to get Nurse Hultson to admit that the rupture of Rappe's bladder could very well have been a result of cancer, and that the bruises on her body could also have been a result of the heavy jewelry she was wearing that evening. During the defense stage of the trial, McNab called various pathology experts who testified that although Rappe's bladder had ruptured, there was evidence of chronic inflammation and no evidence of any pathological changes preceding the rupture; in other words, there was no external cause for the rupture.|$|E

2500|$|The veteran West Indies cricket writer Tony Becca {{wrote in}} the Jamaica Gleaner: [...] "Mendis bowls everything. With <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> as he caresses the ball before {{delivering}} it, he bowls the offbreak, he bowls the legbreak, he bowls the googly, he bowls the flipper, he bowls a straight delivery, he bowls them with different grips and different actions, he bowls them with a different trajectory and at a different pace, and he disguises them brilliantly. The result is that he mesmerises, or bamboozles, batsmen.|$|E

2500|$|Dilshan {{is often}} {{considered}} as a cool headed cricketer with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> even with opposition players. He {{has been known to}} videobomb fellow players such as Chris Gayle. But after a terrible disaster during the New Zealand tour of 2015â€“16, when Sri Lanka lost all three forms and lost the number one spot of Twenty20 team rankings as well, a Sri Lankan cricket fan at Eden Park after the second T20 match against New Zealand, was overheard asking Dilshan to retire from cricket immediately. Dilshan was somewhat angry at this and asked the fan, [...] "Are you going to replace me?" [...] The issue came on social media as well. After Dilshan landed in Sri Lanka, he stated to the media that he would know when to retire, just as he had in test cricket and Sri Lankans who are engaged outside the country must know their limits.|$|E

2500|$|In 1957, when Bosworth's family {{thought it}} was his time to go, Branham visited his bedside, prayed with him, and was greatly {{encouraged}} by his testimony. [...] Bosworth recovered his strength {{and it was not}} until several months later, in 1958, when he eventually died, again with an outstanding testimony. [...] According to his son's description in the 9th edition of [...] "Christ the Healer", the family was gathered around Bosworth's bedside talking, laughing, and singing about three weeks after Bosworth was in bed full-time, [...] Bosworth then looked up, never saw the family members present, and began [...] "to greet and hug people - he was enraptured ... He did this for several hours", then with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> he laid back and went to sleep. [...] When Bosworth died, Branham was asked by the family to come to preach his funeral but was unable to attend because he {{was in the middle of}} a campaign.|$|E
2500|$|While {{an unarmed}} Kennaway {{physically}} restrained the driver, Glennon, {{armed with the}} Derringer, gave cover beside the van as [...] McWilliams opened the side door on the left at the rear, and shouted the words: [...] "Armed INLA volunteers". With <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> he then took up a firing stance and aimed his PA63 pistol inside the van at Wright, who was sitting sideways facing the side door beside Norman Green, with Prison Officer Stephen Sterritt seated behind the driver. Wright {{had been in the}} middle of a conversation, discussing the [...] "cost of Christmas", with both men. After McWilliams ordered Sterritt to [...] "fuck up and sit in his seat" [...] and Green to get out of the way, the two men instantly dropped to the floor to protect themselves; however, Wright stood up and kicked out at his assailant who began firing at point blank range. Green pleaded with Wright to [...] "get down", but McWilliams climbed into the van and continued shooting at Wright, hitting him a total of seven times. Wright, despite being shot, continued to defend himself by moving forward, kicking and lashing out at McWilliams. Wright was fatally wounded by the last shot, the bullet having lacerated his aorta. He slumped against the legs of Green. After screaming [...] "they shot Billy", Green made an attempt to resuscitate Wright, but to no avail; he was brought to the prison hospital, where a doctor pronounced him dead at 10.53 a.m. None of the others inside the van were hurt. Immediately following the shooting attack, the three gunmen returned the way they had come and surrendered to prison guards. They handed over a statement:Billy Wright was executed for one reason and one reason only, and that was for directing and waging his campaign of terror against the nationalist people from his prison cell in Long Kesh [...]|$|E
