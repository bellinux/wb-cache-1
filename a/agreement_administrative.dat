Nowadays, we observe that {{the activity of the}} public administration authorities also includes this legal category, so that we can assert that it has an increasingly share in areas such as delegation of public utilities services, public acquisitions, transport and others.

(4) Administration <b>Agreement</b> ("Admin"): An <b>administrative</b> <b>agreement</b> {{takes place}} between a songwriter/publisher and an {{independent}} administrator, or between a writer/publisher and another music publisher.
