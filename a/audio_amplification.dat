50|$|The most {{successful}} tube in this series, 12BY7A {{was introduced by}} General Electric in June 1955 as a demodulated video signal amplifier for television receivers. Its design specifications called for linear gain along a wide bandwidth (approximately 4 MHz) with low transconductance (13 Millimhos (Millisiemens)) and high sensitivity. This combination of sensitivity, bandwidth and price lead to its popularity in <b>audio</b> <b>amplification</b> systems during the tube era.|$|E
50|$|The EL34 is a {{thermionic}} valve or vacuum tube {{of the power}} pentode type.

50|$|Although the 807 is {{used for}} both <b>audio</b> <b>amplification,</b> (usually class AB, and radio {{frequency}} amplification in the 1-30 MHz range, (usually class C), this type was usually used for the latter.This tube/valve is a pentode with a 'directly heated cathode', meaning that the cathode consists of an emissive oxide coated filament. These features suggest the 4307A could predate and is contemporary with, the 807 which is a beam power tetrode, a more advanced design with a more linear transfer characteristic and a more complex 'indirectly heated cathode'.|$|E
5000|$|A {{masterpiece}} of efficient circuit design, the ST 70 provided reliable, high-quality <b>audio</b> <b>amplification</b> at an affordable price. The {{popularity of the}} ST 70 contributed {{more than any other}} single product to continuing consumer interest in tube-based stereo amplifiers at a time of increasing market dominance by solid state audio products. Because of its excellent value for cost, Dynaco tube amplifiers were often referred to as [...] "the poor man's McIntosh." [...] More than 350,000 ST-70 amplifiers had been sold when production finally ceased, making the ST 70 the most popular tube power amplifier ever made.|$|E
5000|$|The tuned radio {{frequency}} receiver (TRF) {{consists of a}} {{radio frequency}} amplifier having one or more stages all tuned to the desired reception frequency. This {{is followed by a}} detector, typically an envelope detector using a diode, followed by <b>audio</b> <b>amplification.</b> This was developed after the invention of the triode vacuum tube, greatly improving the reception of radio signals using electronic amplification which had not previously been available. The greatly improved selectivity of the superheterodyne receiver overtook the TRF design in almost all applications, however the TRF design was still used as late as the 1960s among the cheaper [...] "transistor radios" [...] of that era.|$|E
5000|$|Tuned Radio Frequency sets (TRF sets) {{were the}} most popular class of early radio, {{primarily}} because the RCA company had a lock on the superheterodyne circuit patents and it was more profitable for companies to jump into radio manufacturing TRF sets. These used several valves (tubes) to provide RF amplification, detection, and <b>audio</b> <b>amplification.</b> Early TRF sets only operated headphones, but by the mid-1920s it was more common to use additional amplification to power a loudspeaker, despite the expense. The sound quality produced from [...] "moving-iron" [...] speakers used on such sets is sometimes described as torturous, although by the late 1920s the Kellogg-Rice dynamic (moving-coil) speaker had begun to find favor due to its superior sound-reproduction ability.|$|E
50|$|The KT88 fits a {{standard}} eight-pin octal socket and has similar pinout and applications as the 6L6 and EL34. Specifically designed for <b>audio</b> <b>amplification,</b> the KT88 has similar ratings to the American 6550 {{which was designed}} {{for use as a}} servo amplifier. It {{is one of the largest}} tubes in its class and can handle significantly higher plate voltages than similar tubes, up to 800 volts. A KT88 push-pull pair in class AB1 fixed bias is capable of 100 watts of output with 2.5% total harmonic distortion or up to about 50W at low distortion in hi-fi applications. The transmitting tubes TT21 and TT22 have almost identical transfer characteristics to KT88 but a different pinout, and by virtue of their anode being connected to the top cap have a higher plate voltage rating (1.25 kilovolt) and a higher power output capability of 200 watts in class AB1 push-pull.|$|E
5000|$|The diagram (right) shows one of {{the most}} common single tube reflex {{circuits}} from the early 1920s. It functioned as a TRF receiver with one stage of RF and one stage of <b>audio</b> <b>amplification.</b> The radio frequency (RF) signal from the antenna passes through the bandpass filter C1, L1, L2, C2 and is applied to the grid of the directly heated triode, V1. The capacitor C6 bypasses the RF signal around the audio transformer winding T2 which would block it. The amplified signal from the plate of the tube is applied to the RF transformer L3, L4 while C3 bypasses the RF signal around the headphone coils. The tuned secondary L4, C5 which is tuned to the input frequency, serves as a second bandpass filter as well as blocking the audio signal in the plate circuit from getting to the detector. Its output is rectified by semiconductor diode D, which was a carborundum point contact type.|$|E
5000|$|A reflex radio receiver, {{occasionally}} {{called a}} reflectional receiver, is a radio receiver design {{in which the}} same amplifier is used to amplify the high-frequency radio signal (RF) and low-frequency audio (sound) signal (AF). [...] It was first invented in 1914 by German scientists Wilhelm Schloemilch and Otto von Bronk, and rediscovered and extended to multiple tubes in 1917 by Marius Latour and William H. Priess. [...] The radio signal from the antenna and tuned circuit passes through an amplifier, is demodulated in a detector which extracts the audio signal from the radio carrier, and the resulting audio signal passes again through the same amplifier for <b>audio</b> <b>amplification</b> before being applied to the earphone or loudspeaker. The reason for using the amplifier for [...] "double duty" [...] was {{to reduce the number}} of active devices, vacuum tubes or transistors, required in the circuit, to reduce the cost. The economical reflex circuit was used in inexpensive vacuum tube radios in the 1920s, and was revived again in simple portable tube radios in the 1930s.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic {{audio tape}} {{opened up a}} vast new range of sonic {{possibilities}} to musicians, composers, producers and engineers. Audio tape was relatively cheap and very reliable, and its fidelity of reproduction was better than any audio medium to date. Most importantly, unlike discs, it offered the same plasticity of use as film. Tape can be slowed down, sped up or even run backwards during recording or playback, with often startling effect. It can be physically edited {{in much the same}} way as film, allowing for unwanted sections of a recording to be seamlessly removed or replaced; likewise, segments of tape from other sources can be edited in. Tape can also be joined to form endless loops that continually play repeated patterns of pre-recorded material. <b>Audio</b> <b>amplification</b> and mixing equipment further expanded tape's capabilities as a production medium, allowing multiple pre-taped recordings (and/or live sounds, speech or music) to be mixed together and simultaneously recorded onto another tape with relatively little loss of fidelity. Another unforeseen windfall was that tape recorders can be relatively easily modified to become echo machines that produce complex, controllable, high-quality echo and reverberation effects (most of which would be practically impossible to achieve by mechanical means).|$|E
5000|$|The reflex receiver, {{invented in}} 1914 by Wilhelm Schloemilch and Otto von Bronk, and rediscovered and {{extended}} to multiple tubes in 1917 by Marius Latour and William H. Priess, was a design {{used in some}} inexpensive radios of the 1920s which enjoyed a resurgence in small portable tube radios of the 1930s and again in {{a few of the}} first transistor radios in the 1950s. [...] It is another example of an ingenious circuit invented {{to get the most out}} of a limited number of active devices. In the reflex receiver the RF signal from the tuned circuit is passed through one or more amplifying tubes or transistors, demodulated in a detector, then the resulting audio signal is passed again though the same amplifier stages for <b>audio</b> <b>amplification.</b> [...] The separate radio and audio signals present simultaneously in the amplifier do not interfere with each other since they are at different frequencies, allowing the amplifying tubes to do [...] "double duty". In addition to single tube reflex receivers, some TRF and superheterodyne receivers had several stages [...] "reflexed". [...] Reflex radios were prone to a defect called [...] "play-through" [...] which meant that the volume of audio did not go to zero when the volume control was turned down.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s {{and with the}} advent of the Compact Disc, PS was one of the first American {{high-end}} audio manufacturers to modify one of the few CD players of the day by replacing its internal <b>audio</b> <b>amplification</b> stage following the internal D to A player. The first and only modified CD player introduced by the company was the CD-1 based on the Philips Magnavox line of CD players. The company engineers chose the Magnavox unit because the belief at the time was it sounded better to its only rival in the marketplace, the Sony. Inside the CD 1 PS engineers added a discrete high voltage line stage and power supply, replacing the NE 5532 op amps used as the output amplification stage of the Magnavox. This unit was a stopgap product designed to get the company [...] "in the game" [...] of this new format that would someday challenge vinyl, the company's core products addressed. In the background, PS engineers were working to figure out a way to utilize the CD player's digital output and create a standalone D to A converter. In late 1982, the company succeeded in releasing the first high-end standalone D to A converter known as the Digital Link. Other manufacturers such as Arcam and Theta were also on the same path and both companies released competing D to A processors within several months of the Digital Link's introduction. From this point onwards, the company has produced a succession of DACS with the same goal in mind - that of supplanting the built in DAC and line stage of CD players. Later advances in CD technology led the high-end audio industry to release a new category of product called a CD Transport that contained no DAC and meant to use as a pair which became known as a DAC and Transport combination.|$|E
