Such relationships are examined for the two traffics of our application, voice and frame relaying. Methods and results are independent of the transfer mode used.

40|$|Consider a {{firm with}} an <b>arbitrary</b> <b>profit</b> {{function}} whose relative price follows a Brownian motion with negative drift. When the firm faces a fixed cost of price adjustment, we prove the optimal pricing {{policy is a}} control band if the following sufficient conditions are met: the profit function is continuous, strictly concave and single-peaked; moreover, together with its first and second derivatives, it is bounded in absolute value by a polynomial. We also demonstrate various ways of constructing the value function associated with the control band policy and show it has certain properties carried over from the profit function. Numerical examples {{are found to be}} consistent with empirical estimates regarding the frequency of price adjustments. (Copyright: Elsevier) stochastic control, menu cost...|$|E
40|$|This paper derives {{equilibrium}} {{financial contract}} forms in a risk-neutral capital market with asymmetrically informed borrowers/entrepreneurs and investors. In doing so, the analysis generalizes {{the work of}} D. DeMeza and D. Webb (1987) by allowing for <b>arbitrary</b> <b>profit</b> distributions, arbitrary contract forms, and variab le investment choices. The main result of this inquiry is as follows. W hen higher-quality entrepreneurs have "better" ex post profit distributions (in {{the sense of the}} monotone likelihood ratio propert y), equilibrium contracts take a standard debt form so long as admissibl e investor payoff functions are monotone nondecreasing in firm profit. Without the monotonicity constraint, contracts often take a differen t, "live-or-die" form. Copyright 1993 by The London School of Economics and Political Science. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{a problem of}} repeatedly scheduling n jobs on m parallel machines. Each job {{is associated with a}} profit, gained each time the job is completed, and the goal is to maximize the average profit per time unit. Once the processing of a job is completed, it goes on vacation and returns to the system, ready to be processed again, only after its vacation is over. This problem has many applications, in production planning, machine maintenance, media-on-demand and databases query processing, among others. We show that the problem is NP-hard already for jobs with unit processing times and unit profits, and develop approximation algorithms, as well as optimal algorithms for certain subclasses of instances. In particular, we show that a preemptive greedy algorithm achieves a ratio of 2 to the optimal for instances with arbitrary processing times and <b>arbitrary</b> <b>profits.</b> For the special case of unit processing times, we present a 1. 67 -approximation algorithm for instances with <b>arbitrary</b> <b>profits,</b> and a 1. 39 -approximation algorithm for instances where all jobs have the same (unit) profits. For the last case, we also show that when the load generated by an instance is sufficiently large (in terms of n and m), any algorithm that uses no intended idle times yields an optimal schedule. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{consider}} {{requests for}} capacity {{in a given}} tree network T = (V; E) where each edge of the tree has some integer capacity ue. Each request consists of an integer demand df and a profit wf which is obtained if the request is satisfied. The objective {{is to find a}} set of demands that can be feasibly routed in the tree and which provide a maximum profit. This generalizes well-known problems including the knapsack and b-matching problems. When all demands are 1, we have the integer multicommodity flow problem. Garg, Vazirani, and Yannakakis had shown that this problem is NP-hard and gave a 2 -approximation algorithm for the cardinality case (all profits are 1) via a primal-dual algorithm. In this paper we establish {{for the first time that}} the natural linear programming relaxation has a constant factor gap, a factor of 4, for the case of <b>arbitrary</b> <b>profits...</b>|$|R

Once the processing of a job is completed, it goes on vacation and returns to the system, ready to be processed again, only after its vacation is over.

We show that the problem is NP-hard already for jobs with unit processing times and unit profits, and develop approximation algorithms as well as optimal algorithms for certain subclasses of instances. We first show that a 5 / 3 -approximation algorithm can be obtained for instances with unit processing times, using known results for windows scheduling. We then present a preemptive greedy algorithm, which yields a ratio of e/(e− 1) to the optimal for general instances, with arbitrary processing times and <b>arbitrary</b> <b>profits.</b> For the special case where all jobs have the same (unit) processing times and the same (unit) profits, we present a 1. 39 -approximation algorithm.

30|$|The {{analyses}} in {{this paper}} {{are the first that}} address the problem of coordination through contracts in supply chains with binomially distributed production yield. They reveal several interesting insights for a buyer–supplier chain with deterministic end-customer demand. The simple WHP contract fails to coordinate, while more sophisticated contracts with reward or penalty scheme enable coordinated behavior in the supply chain without violating the actors’ participation constraints. However, the ORS contract’s ability to coordinate a supply chain depends on the variant that is applied. If a Pull-type contract (without the delivery of excess units) is used, coordination can be achieved. However, if physical delivery of overstock is allowed (Push variant), the contract loses its coordination power. For the PEN contract, however, it can be shown that the design enables SC coordination and, depending on the parameter setting (including a maximum penalty restriction), guarantees an <b>arbitrary</b> <b>profit</b> split.|$|E
40|$|Effective risk {{management}} requires adequate risk measurement. A basic problem herein is the quantification of market risks: {{what is the}} overall effect on a portfolio if market rates change? The rst chapter gives {{a brief review of}} the standard risk measure "Value-At-Risk" (VAR) and introduces the concept of "Maximum Loss" (ML) as a method for identifying the worst case in a given scenario space, called "Trust Region". Next, a technique for calculating efficiently ML for quadratic functions is described; the algorithm is based on the Levenberg-Marquardt theorem, which reduces the high-dimensional optimization problem to a one-dimensional root finding. Following this, the idea of the "Maximum Loss Path" is presented: repetitive calculation of ML for a growing trust region leads to a sequence of worst cases, which form a complete path. Similarly, the paths of "Maximum Profit" (MP) and "Expected Value" (EV) can be determined; the comparison of them permits judgements on the quality of portfolios. These concepts are also applicable to non-quadratic portfolios by using "Dynamic Approximations", which replace <b>arbitrary</b> <b>profit</b> and loss functions with...|$|E
40|$|The Labouchere {{gambling}} {{system is}} hypothesized {{to increase the}} probability of winning a predetermined <b>arbitrary</b> <b>profit</b> in a gambling system such as a coin flip or a roulette game in which both payouts and odds are 1 : 1. However, use of the system increases the downside monetary risk {{in the event of}} a streak of multiple losses. To begin, a player creates an arbitrary series of consecutive integers with a sum equal to the desired profit from multiple rounds of betting. Using the system, a player will either win an amount equal to the sum of the elements of the initial series or lose all of their available capital. This sequence was simulated multiple times to determine the statistical characteristics of both the return and of the loss in an average round of betting. By running the simulations of millions of rounds of Labouchere, it was possible to discern the probable outcomes of running the system using the Labouchere gambling sequence and plotting the results on a graph to map the average return on the initial capital investment. The Labouchere system is very psychologically appealing to players because when applied over time it provides very consistent linear returns. However, there is eventually a critical moment at which the available capital for betting is exceeded and a player loses all of their available capital. It was found that as the number of bets increased, the outcome of applying the sequence approached zero. Comment: 30 page...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{challenging}} problem that many decision makers in coal mining industry face. The coal processing and blending problem (CPBP) builds upon the traditional blending problem known in operations research (OR) by including decision variables around coal processing, novel constraints as well as <b>arbitrary</b> user-defined <b>profit</b> functions which express price bonuses and penalties. The added complexity turns the traditional blending problem into a challenging black-box optimisation problem. We give an informal and mathematical description of this problem and present nine real-world problem instances as benchmark. Finally, we provide preliminary results for solving the problem by using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and compare the results with those from a commercial Linear Programming (LP) solver.

40|$|AbstractConsider {{a company}} that {{manufactures}} perishable goods. The company relies on a third party to deliver goods, which picks up delivery products at regular or irregular times. At each delivery time, {{there is a time}} window that products can be produced to be delivered at that delivery time. The time windows are disjoint. Suppose we have a set of jobs with each job specifying its delivery time, processing time and profit. The company can earn the profit if the job is produced and delivered at its specified delivery time. From the company point of view, we are interested in picking a subset of jobs to produce and deliver so as to maximize the total profit. The unpicked jobs will be discarded without penalty. We consider both the single machine case and the parallel and identical machine case. In this article we consider three kinds of profits: (1) <b>arbitrary</b> <b>profit,</b> (2) equal profit, and (3) profit proportional to its processing time. In the first case, we give a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for a single machine with running time O(n 3 ϵ). Using the bound improvement technique of Kovalyov, the running time can be further reduced to O(n 2 ϵ+n 2 logn). In the second case, we give an O(nlogn) -time optimal algorithm for a single machine. In the third case, we give an FPTAS for a single machine with running time O(n 2 ϵ). All of our algorithms can be extended to parallel and identical machines with a degradation of performance ratios...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} essay, {{we present a}} unified {{treatment}} of postponement strategies in combination of advance purchase contract, option contract, and recourse contract. Specifically, we consider an uncapacitated manufacturer who before uncertainty is resolved offers a monopolistic price-setting newsvendor opportunities to purchase in advance at a given price (advance purchase), and/or to pay to reserve capacity upfront for execution if needed (option); after market uncertainty is resolved, it further offers an expediting alternative for purchase (recourse). To address the linkage between these long and short term contracts, we endogenize the spot market price in the newsvendor model. We show {{that for the most}} general case that includes all three contracts with up to ten decision variables, it can be effectively solved by studying the functional form of a reduced optimization problem in one variable. Therefore, our technique could be adapted to analyze any subsumed postponement models with considerably sharper results. We further show how channel coordination and <b>arbitrary</b> <b>profit</b> allocation can be achieved through non-linear price scheme in the context of advance purchase, options, and recourse contracts. In addition, through numerical analysis, we measure the incremental gains from additional procurement alternatives, and classify the cases in which simpler procurement contracts perform well. ^ The second essay investigates how a manufacturer can influence to its advantage the nature of retailer-competition by carefully selecting contracting elements when selling to retailers who compete in a consumer market: multiple ordering opportunities and the relative market power of retailers. Under a similar modeling framework as depicted in Essay I but with no option contract, we consider two retailers both sourcing from the same manufacturer and when both retailers order in advance, they may order sequentially or simultaneously. Upon receiving orders, the manufacturer produces and delivers them. After uncertainty is resolved, the retailers may trade stock with each other. In addition, they can purchase more from the manufacturer who has the quick-response production capability. We identify sufficient conditions for the existence of pure-strategy equilibria for all settings and obtain sufficient conditions for the advance purchase stage or recourse stage trading to occur. Moreover, through numerical studies, we find that the manufacturer prefers offering advance purchase opportunities to both retailers simultaneously if its production technology is more flexible in the sense that delayed production is not too costly. Otherwise, the manufacturer prefers letting the retailers order sequentially in advance. Offering only one retailer the advance purchase opportunity is always dominated by one of the other two cases. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} an orienteering problem (OP) where an agent needs {{to visit a}} series (possibly a subset) of depots, from which the maximal accumulated profits are desired within given limited time budget. Different from most existing works where the profits {{are assumed to be}} static, in this work we investigate a variant that has <b>arbitrary</b> time-dependent <b>profits.</b> Specifically, the profits to be collected change over time and they follow different (e. g., independent) time-varying functions. The problem is of inherent nonlinearity and difficult to solve by existing methods. To tackle the challenge, we present a simple and effective framework that incorporates time-variations into the fundamental planning process. Specifically, we propose a deterministic spatio-temporal representation where both spatial description and temporal logic are unified into one routing topology. By employing existing basic sorting and searching algorithms, the routing solutions can be computed in an extremely efficient way. The proposed method is easy to implement and extensive numerical results show that our approach is time efficient and generates near-optimal solutions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractGiven {{is a set}} {{of items}} and a set of devices, each {{possessing}} two limited resources. Each item requires some amounts of these resources. Further, each item is associated with a profit and a color, and items of the same color can share the use of one resource. The goal is to allocate the resources to the most profitable (feasible) subset of items. In alternative formulation, the goal is to pack the most profitable subset of items in a set of two-dimensional bins (knapsacks), in which the capacity in one dimension is sharable. Indeed, the special case where there is a single item in each color is the well-known two-dimensional vector packing (2 DVP) problem. Thus, unless P = NP, the problem that we study does not admit a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for a single bin, and is MAX-SNP hard for multiple bins. Our problem has several important applications, including data placement on disks in media-on-demand systems. We present approximation algorithms as well as optimal solutions for some instances. In some cases, our results are similar to the best known results for 2 DVP. Specifically, for a single bin, we show that the problem is solvable in pseudo-polynomial time and develop a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for general instances. For a natural subclass of instances we obtain a simpler scheme. This yields the first combinatorial PTAS for a non-trivial subclass of instances for 2 DVP. For multiple bins, we develop a PTAS for a subclass of instances arising in the data placement problem. Finally, we show that when the number of distinct colors in the instance is fixed, our problem admits a PTAS, even if the items have <b>arbitrary</b> sizes and <b>profits,</b> and the bins are arbitrary...|$|R
