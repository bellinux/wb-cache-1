He recorded his hundredth first-class hundred in 1935 on a damp pitch at Basingstoke, reaching the milestone with 'a flick behind square'. He made 239 against Glamorgan as late as June 1937, only a month short of his 47th birthday. He scored 102 in his final match in England, against Sussex at Hove, but had an unusual end to his career, playing three games at Buenos Aires for Sir TEW Brinkman's XI against Argentina in 1937–38. These matches were designated as first-class, and so he ended with <b>a</b> <b>whimper,</b> not reaching 30 in any of his six innings in South America.|$|E

500|$|According to Prof. Rowe, [...] "ew major controversies {{have ended}} with as slight <b>a</b> <b>whimper</b> {{as the battle}} over federal common law crimes that raged {{in the first two}} decades of the American republic." [...] Rowe argues that [...] "without {{acknowledging}} it, the Hudson Court disapproved at least eight circuit court cases, brushed off the views of all but one Justice who sat on the Court prior to 1804, and departed from what was arguably the original understanding of those who framed the Constitution and penned the Judiciary Act of 1789." [...] Rowe views Hudson as a codification of an issue decided by public opinion, including during the 1800 presidential election: [...] "Hudson set onto tablets the principles that guided the Jeffersonians during their wanderings in the desert." ...|$|E

500|$|Mark Trammell of TV Equals {{was very}} pleased with the episode and wrote that [...] "Rainn Wilson [...] clearly in his element". Damon Houx of Screencrush felt that the entry was rushed, which {{resulted}} in [...] "most characters [...] 2–3 minute storylines, or—in most cases—a joke or line or two." [...] He called it [...] "one of the better episodes of this last season", but noted that [...] "the show's going to end with more of <b>a</b> <b>whimper</b> than a bang". Cindy White of IGN awarded the episode a 7.5 out of 10, denoting a [...] "good" [...] episode. White complimented Dwight and Pam's situation, as well Angela and Oscar's development. However, she noted that it [...] "wasn't hard to imagine Michael in [...] situation". Furthermore, she compared the episode to the third season episode [...] "Women's Appreciation".|$|E
500|$|U2 concert {{historian}} Pimm Jal de la Parra {{called the}} live rendition [...] "sultry, as the screens show a constellation map, giving the crowd {{a feeling of}} floating across the universe by the way it moves, transmitting a mood of distance and loneliness that corresponds {{with the nature of}} the song." [...] Mark Lepage of The Gazette described the dance at the conclusion as [...] "an appropriate moment of human contact after almost two hours of uproar." [...] Julie Romandetta of the Boston Herald believed it to be an anticlimatic finish to the concert, calling the song [...] "low-key" [...] and saying [...] "U2 soared for more than 90 minutes, but left with <b>a</b> <b>whimper,</b> instead of a bang." [...] Gary Graff of the Houston Chronicle believed it to be a [...] "moody show-closer". Writing for The Arizona Daily Star, Gene Armstrong called it an [...] "achingly romantic closing tune", describing the Edge's solo as [...] "especially tender".|$|E

2500|$|Set 244 {{to avoid}} an innings defeat, England started badly again.

2500|$|A {{number of}} new words and phrases have {{found their way into}} the vernacular as well.

2500|$|Allen Tate {{perceived}} a {{shift in}} Eliot's method, writing, [...] "The mythologies disappear altogether in The Hollow Men." [...] This is a striking claim for a poem as indebted to Dante as anything else in Eliot's early work, to say little of the modern English mythology—the [...] "Old Guy Fawkes" [...] of the Gunpowder Plot—or the colonial and agrarian mythos of Joseph Conrad and James George Frazer, which, at least for reasons of textual history, echo in The Waste Land. The [...] "continuous parallel between contemporaneity and antiquity" [...] that is so characteristic of his mythical method remained in fine form.

2500|$|Orbison {{admitted}} {{that he did not}} think his voice was put to appropriate use until [...] "Only the Lonely" [...] in 1960, when it was able, in his words, to allow its [...] "flowering". Carl Perkins, however, toured with Orbison while they were both signed with Sun Records and recalled a specific concert when Orbison covered the Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald standard [...] "Indian Love Call", and had the audience completely silenced, in awe. When compared to the Everly Brothers, who often used the same session musicians, Orbison is credited with [...] "a passionate intensity" [...] that, according to The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll, made [...] "his love, his life, and, indeed, the whole world [...] to be coming to an end—not with <b>a</b> <b>whimper,</b> but an agonized, beautiful bang".|$|E

2500|$|The {{performance}} in Hyde Park received some lukewarm reviews by some major British papers.

Natalie Shaw writing for The Arts Desk wrote that the [...] "MDNA tour finds Madge disastrously sapping the joy out of even her most triumphant choruses." [...] Michael Hubbard from musicOMH rated the concert 2.5 out of five stars, noting that [...] "the vocals are unremarkable at best and auto-tuned to oblivion at worst", calling it [...] "a gig that lacked oomph throughout."
