25|$|Ahmedabad is {{the largest}} city {{in the state of}} Gujarat. It is located in western India {{on the banks of the}} River Sabarmati. The city served as {{political}} <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>economical</b> capital of the region since its establishment. The earliest settlement can be recorded around the 12th century under Chaulukya dynasty rule. The present city was founded on 26 February 1411 and announced as the capital on 4 March 1411 by Ahmed Shah I of Gujarat Sultanate as a new capital. Under the rule of sultanate (1411–1511) the city prospered followed by decline (1511–1572) when the capital was transferred to Champaner. For next 135 years (1572-1707), the city renewed greatness under the early rulers of Mughal Empire. The city suffered due to political instability (1707-1817) under late Mughal rulers followed by joint rule between Maratha and Mughal. The city further suffered following joint Maratha rule. The city again progressed when politically stabilized when British East India Company established the rule in the city (1818-1857). The city further renewed growth when it gain political freedom by establishment of municipality and opening of railway under British crown rule (1857–1947). Following arrival of Mahatma Gandhi in 1915, the city became centre stage of Indian independence movement. Many activists like Sardar Patel served the municipality of the city before taking part in the movement. After independence, the city was a part of Bombay state. When Gujarat was carved out in 1960, it again became the capital of the state until establishment of Gandhinagar in 1965. Ahmedabad is also the cultural and economical centre of Gujarat and the seventh largest city of India.|$|E

2500|$|The grooved {{trolley wheel}} was used on many large city systems through the 1940s and 1950s; it was {{generally}} used on systems with [...] "old" [...] style round cross sectional overhead wire. The trolley wheel was problematic at best; the circumferential contact of the grooved wheel bearing {{on the underside of}} the overhead wire provided minimal electrical contact and tended to arc excessively, increasing overhead wire wear [...] The newer sliding carbon trolley shoe was generally used with a newer grooved overhead trolley wire of a roughly [...] "figure 8" [...] cross section. The sliding trolley shoe provided better electrical contact (with a reduction in arcing), and it dramatically reduced overhead wire wear. Many systems began converting to the sliding trolley shoe in the 1920s; Milwaukee, Wisconsin converted its large system in the late 1920s.
