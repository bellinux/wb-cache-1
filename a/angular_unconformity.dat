5|$|An <b>angular</b> <b>unconformity</b> truncates {{progressively}} older (lower) {{parts of}} the underlying Pahrump Group starting {{in the southern part}} of the area and moving north. At its northernmost extent, the unconformity in fact removed all of the Pahrump, and the Noonday rests directly on the Proterozoic Complex. An ancient period of erosion removed that part of the Pahrump due to its being higher (and thus more exposed) than the rest of the formation.|$|E
5|$|The {{top of the}} {{peninsula}} is fairly flat, reaches an elevation of , and is capped by much younger sandstone and conglomerate deposits from the Pleistocene era, 1 million years or less in age. These flat-lying beds lie directly {{on top of the}} gently dipping Point Loma and Cabrillo formations. The gap in the sedimentary record, called an <b>Angular</b> <b>unconformity,</b> represents about 70 million years of non-deposition and/or erosion.|$|E
5|$|A rift {{opened and}} {{subsequently}} flooded {{the region as}} part of the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia in the Neoproterozoic (by about 755million years ago) and the creation of the Pacific Ocean. A shoreline similar to the present Atlantic Ocean margin of the United States lay to the east. An algal mat-covered carbonate bank was deposited, forming the Noonday Dolomite. Subsidence of the region occurred as the continental crust thinned and the newly formed Pacific widened, forming the Ibex Formation. An <b>angular</b> <b>unconformity</b> (an uneven gap in the geologic record) followed.|$|E

5|$|Uplift {{caused by}} a mountain-building episode called the Laramide orogeny lasted from the late Cretaceous around 70mya to the early Paleocene. This hoisted the once lower uplands skyward while low-lying basins between them {{gradually}} subsided. Compression from the Laramide event deformed the land {{in the area to}} form the up to 5° dipping Bryce Canyon Anticline. All of the Canaan Peak, Pine Hollow, Kaiparowits, and Waheap formations, along with part of the underlying Straight Cliffs, were removed from the anticline's crest by erosion before the Claron Formation was deposited. An <b>angular</b> <b>unconformity</b> therefore exists along the anticline's crest. The park also sits on the western gently dipping flank of the much larger Kaibab uplift, which was also formed {{as a result of the}} Laramide.|$|E
25|$|Excellent {{exposures}} of the <b>angular</b> <b>unconformity</b> {{at the top}} of the Dox Formation and {{the base}} of the Tapeats Sandstone can be seen at Mile 71.0 where Tapeats Sandstone rests on the eroded surface of the Dox Formation, and a basalt sill. In these exposures, Dox red beds and a dark gray basaltic sill, dip 8 to 10 degrees to the east. They are covered by nearly horizontal Tapeats Sandstone. The surface of this <b>angular</b> <b>unconformity</b> is quite irregular as differential erosion of the resistant basalt sill formed monadnocks that have been buried by Tapeats Sandstone.|$|E
25|$|Major unconformities {{separate}} the Unkar Group from the strata overlying and underlying it. First, the Unkar Group, as the bottom {{unit of the}} Grand Canyon Supergroup, lies directly upon deeply eroded granites, gneisses, pegmatites, and schists that comprise Vishnu Basement Rocks. Second, an <b>angular</b> <b>unconformity,</b> with a dip of less than 10°, separates {{the base of the}} Nankoweap Formation from the underlying Unkar Group. Finally, a well-defined <b>angular</b> <b>unconformity</b> {{at the base of the}} relatively flat-lying Tonto Group separates it from the underlying faulted and folded strata of the Unkar Group and the rest of the Grand Canyon Supergroup that are typically tilted at angles of 10°–30°.|$|E

50|$|The {{stratigraphy}} of the Middle Magdalena Basin can {{be divided}} into three sequences separated by <b>angular</b> <b>unconformities.</b> The basement of these sequences is Pre-Mesozoic metaclastics and sediments which are now exposed {{on the surface of the}} Central Cordillera as a result of its deformation and uplift. This geologic basement is at most 15 km deep, with faulted sections shifted up to approximately 10 km in depth. The unconformity that separates the basement from the first sequences indicates the approximate time rifting began.|$|R
25|$|Rocks of {{probable}} lower Devonian age {{are exposed}} near Yesnaby, on western Mainland. A ridge of granitic basement divides the Hara Ebb Formation, {{a sequence of}} breccias, conglomerates and sandstones deposited in an alluvial fan setting, from the Yesnaby Sandstone which was deposited in an aeolian setting. The contact with the overlying Middle Devonian lacustrine Lower Stromness Flagstones is an <b>angular</b> <b>unconformity.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{contact between}} the Tapeats Sandstone and Bass Formation {{and the rest of}} the folded and faulted Unkar Group is a {{prominent}} <b>angular</b> <b>unconformity,</b> which is part of the Great Unconformity. The differential erosion of the Unkar Group left resistant beds of the Cardenas Basalt and Shinumo Quartzite as topographic highs, ancient monadnocks, that are now buried by sandstones, shales, and conglomerates of the Tapeats Sandstone. These monadnocks served locally as sources of coarse-grained sediments during the marine transgression that deposited the Tapeats Sandstone and other members of the Tonto Group. The {{contact between the}} Bass Formation and the Tapeats Sandstone forms part of a relative flat surface that lies between the monadnocks.|$|E
25|$|Sediment {{collected}} in various lakes {{in the area}} from around 17 to 15 million years ago, becoming the Miocene-aged Colter Formation. Beginning around 13 million years ago (also in the Miocene), a 40-mile (64-km) long steeply east dipping normal fault system called the Teton Fault started to vertically move two adjacent blocks. One block, the Jackson Hole basin, moved down while the other block, containing the westward-tilting {{eastern part of the}} Teton Range, moved up; thus creating the youngest mountain range in the Rocky Mountains. Most of the downward movement occurred right next to the fault, resuling in a 15° tilt of the Colter Formation. No sediment was deposited on top of the tilted Colter Formation for up to three million years, resulting in an <b>angular</b> <b>unconformity</b> as the tilted Colter partially eroded away.|$|E
25|$|The global flood cannot explain {{geological}} formations such as <b>angular</b> <b>unconformities,</b> where {{sedimentary rocks}} have been tilted and eroded then more sedimentary layers deposited on top, needing {{long periods of}} time for these processes. There is also the time needed for the erosion of valleys in sedimentary rock mountains. In another example, the flood, had it occurred, should also have produced large-scale effects spread throughout the entire world. Erosion should be evenly distributed, yet the levels of erosion in, for example, the Appalachians and the Rocky Mountains differ significantly.|$|R

25|$|The Cardenas Basalt is {{composed}} mainly of thin discontinuous beds of pahoehoe lava flows of olivine-rich basalt. The {{lower part of}} this formation consists of complexly interbedded, thin, and discontinuous beds of basalt, hyaloclastite, and sandstone that form low, talus-covered slopes. The upper unit of the Cardenas Basalt consists of cliff-forming basaltic and andesitic lava flows that are interbedded with beds of breccia, sandstone, and lapillite. No fossils {{have been found in}} the Cardenas Basalt. The Cardenas Basalt was formed by the subaerial eruption of basaltic and andesitic magma in wet coastal environments such as river deltas or tidal flats. <b>Angular</b> <b>unconformities</b> of vastly differing magnitudes separate the Cardenas Basalt from the overlying Nankoweap Formation and Tonto Group.|$|R

2500|$|The {{contact between}} the Tonto Group and Unkar Group is a {{prominent}} <b>angular</b> <b>unconformity,</b> {{which is part of}} the Great Unconformity. The surface of this <b>angular</b> <b>unconformity</b> truncates dipping strata comprising the folded and faulted Unkar Group. Though this surface is typically a plane, differential erosion of the tilted strata of the Unkar Group left resistant beds of the upper layer Cardenas Basalt and the middle layer Shinumo Quartzite as ancient hills, called monadnocks. These ancient hills, which are ridges formed by block faulting, are up to [...] tall. Thin drapes of Tapeats Sandstone of the Tonto Group either cover or drape onto most of these ancient monadnocks. However, the summits of the highest monadnocks protrude up through the base layer Tapeats Sandstone and are blanketed by overlying Bright Angel Shale as can be seen at Isis Temple. Lava Butte is a partially exhumed prehistoric monadnock associated with this unconformity that consists of Cardenas Basalt. These monadnocks served locally as sources of coarse-grained sediments during the marine transgression that deposited the Tapeats Sandstone (Tapeats Sea), and other members of the Tonto Group.|$|E
2500|$|An {{unconformity}} is a buried erosional or non-depositional surface separating two rock masses or {{strata of}} different ages, indicating that sediment deposition was not continuous. In general, the older layer {{was exposed to}} erosion for an interval of time before deposition of the younger, but the term is used to describe any break in the sedimentary geologic record. [...] The significance of <b>angular</b> <b>unconformity</b> (see below) was shown by James Hutton, who found examples of Hutton's Unconformity at Jedburgh in 1787 and at Siccar Point in 1788.|$|E
2500|$|The {{overlying}} Tonto Group {{is separated}} from the Dox Sandstone {{and the rest of}} folded and faulted Unkar Group by a prominent <b>angular</b> <b>unconformity,</b> {{which is part of the}} Great Unconformity. Typically, the surface of this unconformity is a remarkably flat, ancient erosional surface, often argued to be a peneplain, that cuts across units such as the Bass Formation, Hatakai Shale, and Dox Sandstone. Resistant beds within the Unkar Group, such as Cardenas Basalt and Shinumo Quartzite, form ancient hills, called monadnocks, that rise as much as [...] high above this ancient plain. Thin drapes of Tapeats Sandstone of the Tonto Group now cover most of these ancient monadnocks. However, a few of these monadnocks protrude up into the Bright Angel Shale. These monadnocks served locally as sources of coarse-grained sediments that accumulated during the marine transgression to form the Tonto Group.|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{efficient}} full-volume automatic dense-picking method for flattening seismic data. First local dips (step-outs) are calculated {{over the entire}} seismic volume. The dips are then resolved into time shifts (or depth shifts) using a nonlinear Gauss-Newton iterative approach that exploits fast Fourier transforms to minimize computation time. To handle faults (discontinuous reflections), we apply a weighted inversion scheme. The weight identifies locations of faults, allowing dips to be summed around the faults to reduce the influence of erroneous dip estimates near the fault. If a fault model is not provided, we can estimate a suitable weight (essentially a fault indicator) within our inversion using an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) method. The method is tested successfully on both synthetic and field data sets of varying degrees of complexity, including salt piercements, <b>angular</b> <b>unconformities,</b> and laterally limited faults...|$|R

One {{of them is}} the Carnegie Ridge (400 kmwide, 2 km high) produced by the relationship between the Galapagos Hotspot and the GalapagosSpreading Center. The ages and the effects of the Carnegie Ridge subduction on the Ecuadorianmargin are still a matter of debate. Newly acquired offshore data complementing the onshorerecord help to highlight part of this history. The goal {{of this study is to}} describe the last 1 Ma sedimentary record of Ecuadorian continentalshelf to improve our understanding of the impact of the Carnegie ridge subduction on sea floor andshoreline morphologies. For this aim, we acquired high-resolution (50 - 450 Hz frequency) multichannel(72 channels) and single channel (Sparker) seismic data, piston cores, sediment profiles(3. 5 khz) and high-resolution multibeam bathymetry, during the ATACAMES cruise of the RVL’Atalante, in 2012. In the offshore, we identified two types of Quaternary basins: the platform basins locatedat northern limit of the Carnegie Ridge, and the slope basins located along the margin in front ofCarnegie Ridge subduction. All of them exhibit three major <b>angular</b> <b>unconformities,</b> whichencompass some minor unconformities that limit transgressive-regressive sequences (T-R se- quences),which correlate to 100 to 40 kyrs Milankovitch cycles.

This landward stepping started by 1. 4 Ma in agreement with theage postulated by some author for the beginning of the Carnegie ridge subduction. The highlysubsiding platform basins bordering the northern side of the Carnegie Ridge are bounded by a set ofregional faults, which includes the Jama fault zone.

The development of the fluvial system has been reconstructed for the period since the Messinian, when the valley was deeply carved and uphead eroded, and the drainage basin was widened. The deposits preserved along or close to the present valley have been subdivided into five allostratigraphic units on the basis of bounding unconformities, supported also by petrographic (pebble and sandstone) data, facies and structural analysis.
