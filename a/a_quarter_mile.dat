5|$|Intended to {{run from}} State Route 251, a highway {{that has not been}} constructed, SR 37 begins in Novato with a {{junction}} at U.S. Route 101 and heads northeast as a freeway for about <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>mile</b> before becoming a four-lane expressway. The route passes over the Petaluma River into Sonoma County before meeting the southern terminus of State Route 121 at a signal-controlled intersection near Sears Point and the Sonoma Raceway.|$|E
5|$|Solomon Taylor {{ordered the}} group of locals not to fire. It is unclear which group fired first, but three shots were heard, one of which hit Lieutenant Robinson. When the deserters fled the scene the Lincoln Midnight Riders chased them {{approximately}} <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>mile</b> before turning back. The shooting was mentioned in the Columbia Democrat which also wished Robinson a full recovery. Robinson died from peritonitis on November 3, 1864.|$|E

5|$|In Houghton County, FFH16 and M-28 {{meet in the}} Duncan Township {{community}} of Kenton. The former roadway turns east and runs concurrently along the latter one for approximately <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>mile</b> (0.4km) before turning northward again, leaving town near the cemetery. The forest highway tracks due north until Bob Lake. There the roadway meanders through the area near another National Forest campground and crosses into eastern Ontonagon County. FFH16 crosses back into Houghton County one last time. Immediately after crossing the county line, the forest highway terminates at an intersection with M-38 west of the {{community of}} Nisula.|$|E
5|$|Structural damage {{ranged from}} the {{superficial}} to complete wall or roof failure, the latter being relatively uncommon. A multitude of buildings, including churches, a visitor's center, the House of Assembly building in Hamilton, and the Bermuda Police Service headquarters at Prospect Camp, suffered some degree of roof damage. Older structures were particularly prone to substantial damage, as were commercial storage buildings subject to less strict building codes. In December, five new slate quarries were approved to accommodate the demand for roofing materials. Both the new and old portions of the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital received significant damage that exposed the facilities to the elements. An exhibit at the Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo was unroofed, and coastal erosion threatened to encroach on the site, though no animals were harmed. Part of the structure's roof was blown <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>mile</b> (400 m).|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of the Kalacoon research station enabled Beebe to research {{the ecology of the}} surrounding jungle in far more detail than had been possible during his earlier expeditions. Using Kalacoon as his base of operations, Beebe performed a novel type of study: methodically dissecting a small area of jungle, and all of the animals which inhabit it, {{from the top of the}} canopy to below the ground. In a second study, Beebe performed the same task for a much larger area of jungle, approximately <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>mile</b> (0.4km) square. During his first season at Kalacoon in 1916, Beebe brought back 300 living specimens for the zoo. This time he succeeded at capturing a hoatzin, the bird that he had narrowly missed during his earlier trip to Guiana, although he was unable to keep it alive for the zoo during the trip back to New York.|$|E
