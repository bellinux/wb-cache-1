40|$|The larva of {{codling moth}} Cydia pomonella (Tortricidae, Lepidoptera) {{is known as}} the worm in the <b>apple,</b> <b>mining</b> the fruit for food. We here show that codling moth larvae are closely {{associated}} with yeasts of the genus Metschnikowia. Yeast {{is an essential part of}} the larval diet and further promotes larval survival by reducing the incidence of fungal infestations in the apple. Larval feeding, on the other hand, enables yeast proliferation on unripe fruit. Chemical, physiological and behavioral analyses demonstrate that codling moth senses and responds to yeast aroma. Female moths are attracted to fermenting yeast and lay more eggs on yeast-inoculated than on yeast-free apples. An olfactory response to yeast volatiles strongly suggests a contributing role of yeast in host finding, in addition to plant volatiles. Codling moth is a widely studied insect of worldwide economic importance, and it is noteworthy that its association with yeasts has gone unnoticed. Tripartite relationships between moths, plants, and microorganisms may, accordingly, be more widespread than previously thought. It, therefore, is important to study the impact of microorganisms on host plant ecology and their contribution to the signals that mediate host plant finding and recognition. A better comprehension of host volatile signatures also will facilitate further development of semiochemicals for sustainable insect control...|$|R

And all the other methods, which are in the technological process of obtaining coal rely on the technology of drilling-blasting works, {{in terms of the}} mine 'Soko', can not allow mass production of coal, regarding natural and technical-technological conditions prevailing in Sokobanja coal basin. Therefore, this paper proposes a possible solution which would enable a significant increase in annual production by <b>appling</b> mechanized coal <b>mining</b> system...|$|R
6000|$|... 3. As the God of our mercy has mercy {{to guide}} us, and uphold us; {{so by the}} same will he {{instruct}} us when {{we are at a}} loss, at a stand. 'I led Israel about,' says God, 'I instructed him, and kept him as the <b>apple</b> of <b>mine</b> eye' (Deut 32:10). I say we are often at a loss; David said, after all his brave sayings, in Psalm 119, 'I have gone astray like a lost sheep: seek thy servant' (v 176). Indeed a Christian is not so often out of the way, as he is at a stand therein, and knows not what to do. But here also is his mercy as to that. 'Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left' (Isa 30:21). Mercy follows for this.|$|R

40|$|The apple ermine moth, Yponomeuta malinellus Zeller, is a {{univoltine}} pest {{species that}} defoliates apple, Malus domestics (Borkh) (Rosaceae), in the temperate {{region of the}} Palaearctic. First instars overwinter within a communal hibernaculum beneath the covering of the egg batch (Kock 1998). In spring, larvae emerge to initially <b>mine</b> <b>apple</b> leaves and subsequently feed externally within a communal tent (Menken et al. 1992). During heavy infestations, the communal tents may envelop the entire apple tree, resulting in total defoliation (Parker and Schmidt 1985). There have been several accidental introductions and subsequent eradications of the apple ermine moth in eastern North America (Hewitt 1917; Parker and Schmidt 1985) but, by 1989, the pest {{was found in the}} Fraser River Valley in British Columbia, in Whatcom county, Washington, and in northwestern Oregon (Antonelli 1991; Unruh et al. 1993...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore the {{relationship}} that the Internet, social media, and consumer loyalty have on teenagers' self-perception today in contrast to earlier generations. For two years I <b>mined</b> <b>Apple</b> Store display computers for photographs that visitors left behind. These photographs tell a story about teenagers being forced to look at themselves {{through the lens of}} technology, the Internet, and online peers. I also mined YouTube for what is known as Apple Store Dances, and explored the physical and psychological relationship teenagers have with themselves in the mirroring process of dancing before computer screens in public. I discuss these two image sets in relation to mythology, sociology, postmodernism, the Apple Store's architecture and design, and the grid. Finding that I often reverted back to and indulged in being a teenager myself in this process, the project is both personalized and reflects an artist-researcher's analysis...|$|R

[...] Grisell by the by was far taller than the plump little goodwoman Hall, but that was no matter, and the Prioress had barely space to get in a word of thanks before she went on: [...] "I will keep her and tend her as the <b>apple</b> of <b>mine</b> eye.

She shall be my bedfellow wherever we halt, and sit next me, and be cherished as though she were mine own daughter--ladybird as she is-- till I can give her {{into the hands of the}} good Lady Countess. Oh yes--you may trust Joan Hall, dame reverend mother. She is no new traveller. I have been in my time to all our shrines--to St. Thomas of Canterbury, to St. Winifred's Well, aye, and, moreover, to St. James of Compostella, and St. Martha of Provence, not to speak of lesser chantries and Saints. Aye, and I crossed the sea to see the holy coat of Treves, and St. Ursula's eleven thousand skulls--and a gruesome sight they were. Nay, if the Lady Countess be not in London it would cost me little to go on to the north with her. There's St. Andrew of Ely, Hugh, great St. Hugh and little St. Hugh, both of them at Lincoln, and there's St. Wilfred of York, and St. John of Beverly, not to speak of St. Cuthbert of Durham and of St. Hilda of Whitby, who might take it ill if I pray at none of their altars, when I have been to so many of their brethren. Oh, you may trust me, reverend mother; I'll never have the young lady, bless her sweet face, out of my sight till I have safe bestowed her with my Lady Countess, our good customer for all manner of hardware, or else with her own kin." ...|$|R
