5|$|Glass Joe is a 38-year-old French {{flyweight}} boxer who {{hails from}} Paris. He stands at 177.8 centimeters (5'10) and weighs in at 49.9 kilograms (110 lbs.). His win record is one win to 99 losses. He is the weakest opponent {{and the first}} players encounter in any of his roles. His mediocrity {{has been attributed to}} poor blocking <b>and</b> <b>reaction</b> time. He possesses several negative stereotypes of French people.|$|E
5|$|Other organic {{materials}} such as leather, skin and textiles were treated similarly, by keeping them moist in tanks or sealed plastic containers. Bone and ivory was desalinated to prevent damage from salt crystallisation, as was glass, ceramic and stone. Iron, copper and copper alloy objects were kept moist in a sodium sesquicarbonate solution to prevent oxidisation <b>and</b> <b>reaction</b> with the chlorides that had penetrated the surface. Alloys of lead and pewter are inherently stable in the atmosphere and generally require no special treatment. Silver and gold were the only materials that required no special passive storage.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{is popular}} with D.Gray-man readers, usually ranking {{in the top}} three on the series' {{popularity}} polls, <b>and</b> <b>reaction</b> has been generally positive in manga and anime publications and other media. His characterization has been praised, with critics noting that his calm demeanor and mysterious origin are atypical of a shōnen protagonist. Some reviewers also enjoyed Allen's multiple voice actors. Merchandise has been offered with Allen's likeness, including plush dolls, figurines, clothing and cosplay pieces. In addition to being the protagonist of the anime adaptation series D.Gray-man and its sequel, D.Gray-man Hallow, he has appeared in three light novels, two video games and several crossover fighting games.|$|E

5|$|At the time, prison-based {{films were}} not {{considered}} likely box office successes, but Darabont's script was read by then-Castle Rock Entertainment producer Liz Glotzer, whose interest in prison stories, <b>and</b> <b>reaction</b> to the script, led her to threaten to quit if Castle Rock did not produce The Shawshank Redemption. Director and Castle Rock co-founder Rob Reiner also liked the script. He offered Darabont between $2.4 million and $3 million {{to allow him to}} direct it himself. Reiner, who had previously adapted King's novella The Body into the 1986 film Stand by Me, planned to cast Tom Cruise as Andy and Harrison Ford as Red.|$|E
5|$|In summer 969, Sviatoslav {{returned}} to Bulgaria in force, accompanied by allied Pecheneg and Magyar contingents. In his absence, Pereyaslavets had been recovered by Boris II; the Bulgarian defenders {{put up a}} determined fight, but Sviatoslav stormed the city. Thereafter Boris and Roman capitulated, and the Rus' rapidly established control over eastern and northern Bulgaria, placing garrisons in Dorostolon and the Bulgarian capital of Preslav. There Boris continued to reside and exercise nominal authority as Sviatoslav's vassal. In reality he {{was little more than}} a figurehead, retained in order to lessen Bulgarian resentment at <b>and</b> <b>reaction</b> to the Rus' presence. Sviatoslav appears to have been successful in enlisting Bulgarian support. Bulgarian soldiers joined his army in considerable numbers, tempted partly by the prospects of booty, but also enticed by Sviatoslav's anti-Byzantine designs and probably mollified by a shared Slavic heritage. The Rus' ruler himself was careful not to alienate his new subjects: he forbade his army from looting the countryside or plundering cities that surrendered peacefully.|$|E
