The researchers also supported the loops acting as a resonance chamber, comparable to the enlongated nasal passages of saiga antelope and looping trachea of cranes and swans. Reconstructions of the inner ear suggest adaptation to hearing at low frequencies, such as the low-toned resonant sounds possibly produced by the nasal passages. They disputed {{the possibility that the}} looping is related to olfaction (sense of smell) as the olfactionary region is pushed to the sides of the main airway.|$|E
