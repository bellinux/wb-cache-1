In <b>anti-interferon</b> globulin-treated mice infected intraperitoneally with herpes simplex virus (HSV) type I, the latent period was shortened, and the overall LD 50 was increased several hundredfold compared to virus-infected control mice.

Patients diagnosed as having chronic hepatitis C, confirmed by PCR (HCV RNA) and liver biopsy, were treated with interferon alpha 2 a or 2 b for at least six months, and were followed up for 24 weeks after termination of treatment in order to assess biochemical, virological and clinical pathology responses. Only 6 % of the 94 patients developed anti-IFN antibodies, 70 % presented a biochemical response and 23 % maintained a sustained virological response. Clinical evaluation revealed that in only 2 patients was there progression of fibrosis; the necro-inflammatory score indicated that 72 % maintained the same activity, 12 % had worsening necro-inflammatory activity, and the remaining 16 % had decreased activity. There was no significant correlation of demographic and laboratory variables with levels of <b>anti-interferon</b> antibodies.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} if a retreatment with natural human interferon alpha could lead to a recovery of the therapeutic responsiveness in nonresponder patients with chronic hepatitis C who did (9 cases) or did not (14 cases) develop <b>anti-interferon</b> neutralizing antibodies while on treatment with recombinant interferon alpha 2 a. During retreatment, no patient developed detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies to natural interferon. At the end of retreatment, 6 / 9 positive patients showed a complete response to natural interferon Therapy, while only 1 / 14 negative patients had a partial response. These data suggest that a second course of treatment with the natural preparation may be useful in patients who failed to respond to an earlier course of recombinant interferon, particularly the <b>anti-interferon</b> positive patients who showed hepatitis reactivation after an initial response concomitantly with antibody appearance. Conversely, a second course of natural interferon therapy might be useless in cases in which the lack of response is not associated to antibody development...|$|E

This infection produced variable but small amounts of progeny virus and interferon (up to 100 IU/ml), and resisted superinfection with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Sindbis virus as well as homologous rabies virus. The treatment of this infection with <b>anti-interferon</b> antibody stimulated virus replication and extensive c. p. e. However, some cells survived and grew rapidly without any sign of c. p. e.

However, when these mice were injected intraperitoneally with potent sheep (or goat) anti-mouse interferon alpha/beta globulin 4 days prior to harvesting peritoneal macrophages, the viruses multiplied to high titers and most of the cells were infected, as determined by total virus yield (VSV and EMCV), percentage of VSV antigen-positive cells (immunofluorescence), and determination of VSV infectious centers. This effect was not observed when mice were inoculated with other sheep hyperimmune or normal serum globulins. <b>Anti-interferon</b> globulin appeared to act in vivo because incubation of this globulin with peritoneal macrophages during the period of cell attachment or during the 18 hr after virus absorption did not render these cells permissive for VSV.

40|$|Theiler's {{virus is}} a {{picornavirus}} {{responsible for a}} persistent infection of {{the central nervous system}} of the mouse, leading to a chronic demyelinating disease considered to be a model for multiple sclerosis. The leader (L) protein encoded by Theiler's virus is a 76 -amino-acid-long peptide containing a zinc-binding motif. This motif is conserved in the L proteins of all cardioviruses, including encephalomyocarditis virus. The L protein of Theiler's virus was suggested to interfere with the alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) response (W. -P. Kong, G. D. Ghadge, and R. P. Roos, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91 : 1796 - 1800, 1994). We show that expression of the L protein indeed inhibits the production of alpha/beta interferon by infected L 929 cells. The L protein specifically inhibits the transcription of the IFN-alpha 4 and IFN-beta genes, which are known to be activated early in response to viral infection. Mutation of the zinc finger was sufficient to block the <b>anti-interferon</b> activity, outlining the importance of this motif in the L protein function. In agreement with the <b>anti-interferon</b> role of the L protein, a virus bearing a mutation in the zinc-binding motif was dramatically impaired in its ability to persist in the central nervous system of SJL/J mice...|$|E

We have measured levels of circulating IL- 1 b, IL- 6, TNF-a and soluble CD 23 (sCD 23) in 8 patients with Binet stage A B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) receiving IFN therapy, and compared these with changes in the lymphocyte count following IFN therapy.

In a further two patients, there was correlation with levels of sCD 23 alone, while the remaining three patients showed no correlation between lymphocyte count and the serum cytokines measured.

40|$|The murine suppressive {{factor of}} allergy (SFA) has been {{purified}} from a T-cell hybridoma {{and found to}} consist of two functionally and biochemically distinct protein molecules. One protein (17 kDa) modulates the low-affinity Fc receptor for IgE on lymphocytes (i. e., CD 23); it decreases the binding avidity of IgE to CD 23 -bearing B cells without affecting quantitative expression of CD 23 and is thus designated epsilon-receptor-modulating protein. The second protein (30 kDa) suppresses IgE biosynthesis (i. e., SFA). This purified SFA suppresses interleukin 4 -induced IgE and IgG 1 synthesis by lipopolysaccharide-activated spleen cells but {{has no effect on}} other antibody isotypes; since the activity of SFA is not blocked by <b>anti-interferon</b> gamma monoclonal antibody, it is thus distinct from interferon gamma.

While low titer autoantibodies to these and other cytokines may be detected in normal individuals, patients with infectious or autoimmune manifestations tend to have high titer autoantibodies that may block or potentiate the function of the respective cytokine. Recognition of these autoantibodies is important because it may direct treatment toward a combination of adjunctive immunotherapy to modulate the autoantibody level while continuing with appropriate anti-microbial therapy.

This procedure uses an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure the inhibitory effect of human {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} on VZV antigen production by VZV-infected cell monolayers. When mononuclear cells from VZV-immune, tetanus-immune donors were stimulated with either VZV antigen or tetanus toxoid they reduced VZV antigen production. In contrast, mononuclear cells from VZV-nonimmune, tetanus-immune donors reduced VZV antigen only when stimulated with tetanus toxoid, but not when stimulated with VZV antigen. Cell-free supernatants recovered from the VZV inhibition assays contained the anti-VZV activity. The magnitude of the anti-VZV activity of the supernatants equalled the inhibition observed when the stimulated mononuclear cells were added to the VZV-infected monolayers. Treatment of either mononuclear cells or supernatants with <b>anti-interferon</b> gamma antibody indicated that their VZV inhibitory capability was largely due to the production of interferon gamma by stimulated mononuclear cells...|$|E
40|$|Infected cells {{recognize}} {{viral replication}} as a DNA damage stress and elicit a DNA damage response that ultimately induces apoptosis {{as part of}} host immune surveillance. Here, we demonstrate a novel mechanism where the murine gamma herpesvirus 68 (gammaHV 68) latency-associated, <b>anti-interferon</b> M 2 protein inhibits DNA damage-induced apoptosis by interacting with the DDB 1 /COP 9 /cullin repair complex and the ATM DNA damage signal transducer. M 2 expression constitutively induced DDB 1 nuclear localization and ATM kinase activation {{in the absence of}} DNA damage. Activated ATM subsequently induced Chk activation and p 53 phosphorylation and stabilization without eliciting H 2 AX phosphorylation and MRN recruitment to foci upon DNA damage. Consequently, M 2 expression inhibited DNA repair, rendered cells resistant to DNA damage-induced apoptosis, and induced a G(1) cell cycle arrest. Our results suggest that gammaHV 68 M 2 blocks apoptosis-mediated intracellular innate immunity, which might ultimately contribute to its role in latent infection...|$|E

In addition, leukocyte interferon contained also a minor component with antigenic determinants characteristic of fibroblast specificity, which could be isolated by affinity chromatography on Sepharose-bound antibodies directed against firboblast interferon. Neutralization tests with selected <b>anti-interferon</b> sera suggested that the antiviral activities of leukocyte and fibroblast interferons in human and rabbit cells were associated with single molecules. A model is proposed where molecules of human interferon contain multiple reactive sites each of which is capable of interaction with cells of a different species.

One mechanisms possibly responsibile {{for development of}} hyporesponsiveness in these animals is a circulating factor which can be detected in their serum 96 h after encephalomyocarditis virus infection (at the time of peak hyporeactivity in vivo).

The {{results show that the}} inhibition of megakaryocyte colony growth induced by IFN alpha- 2 a was totally suppressed {{in the presence of the}} two ET patients' sera, whereas the inhibition induced by lymphoblastoid IFN alpha was not significantly affected. These in vitro data demonstrate the high specificity and activity of these antibodies on the antiproliferative effect of IFN alpha- 2 a...|$|E
