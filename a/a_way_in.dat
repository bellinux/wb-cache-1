5|$|In the 1840s, {{women in}} America were {{reaching}} out for greater control of their lives. Husbands and fathers directed the lives of women, and many doors were closed to female participation. State statutes and common law prohibited women from inheriting property, signing contracts, serving on juries and voting in elections. Women's prospects in employment were dim: they could expect only to gain a very few service-related jobs and were paid about half of what men were paid for the same work. In Massachusetts, Brook Farm was founded by Sophia Ripley and her husband George Ripley in 1841 {{as an attempt to}} find <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> which men and women could work together, with women receiving the same compensation as men. The experiment failed.|$|E

5|$|As {{the player}} moves from world to world, eradicating the Heartless, Chirithy has brief conversations {{with one of}} the Foretellers and another Chirithy {{regarding}} concerning events. Once in a while, the player return to Daybreak Town where they meet another Keyblade wielder named , who is part of a rival union. He wishes to explore a mysterious tower that lies within the center of the town, and against Chirithy's wishes, the player agrees to help find <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>in.</b> Ephemer, however, abandons the player to explore the tower himself. During the player's exploration, the tower is discovered to be the base of the Foretellers, and while there, the player is confronted by Master Ava, the Foreteller they had met previously. She challenges the player to test their strength, and afterwards tells the player they have sadness in their hearts, which links them to the darkness. Undeterred, the player continues their mission and later meets another Keyblade wielder named , who comes from Ephemer's union. She expresses an interest in further exploring the mysterious tower of the Foretellers. She and the player encounter warring Foretellers from different unions and new kinds of Heartless that are revealed to be corrupted Keyblade wielders as well as a dark vision of Chirithy called Nightmare Chirithy (who is the same Chirithy that had been speaking with the player's).|$|E

5|$|In 1075, Toirdelbach drove Gofraid {{from the}} kingship and Ireland itself. There is {{uncertainty}} concerning {{the circumstances of}} Gofraid's expulsion, and of Domnall's accession. On one hand, {{it is possible that}} Gofraid was involved in lending assistance to Anglo-Danish resistance against the Norman regime in the recently conquered Kingdom of England. If correct, Gofraid would appear to have been at odds with Toirdelbach, a monarch who appears to have cultivated close links with the Norman regime. Domnall, therefore, may have had Toirdelbach's consent to rule in Dublin as Gofraid's replacement. In fact, Toirdelbach's placement of Domnall in Dublin, and his allowance of the latter's aforesaid cousin in Leinster, may have been <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> which the Uí Briain exploited the fractured Uí Chennselaig. Certainly, Domnall's cooperation would have been a valuable asset to Toirdelbach, considering the prominence of his father amongst the Dubliners, and the likelihood that Domnall himself may have lived most of his life there. On the other hand, it is possible that Gofraid was driven from the kingship because he had aligned himself with the Leinstermen against the Uí Briain. If such a sequence of events is correct it could mean that, even though Gofraid was unable continue on with the revolt, it was his Uí Chennselaig confederates who succeeded in securing Dublin from the Uí Briain.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, the {{introduction}} of Augustinians and Premonstratensians into Galloway may {{have been part of}} a process of revitalising the newly reformed diocese. The construction of ecclesiastical buildings, much like castles, was often a means by which mediaeval rulers displayed their pre-eminent status, which in turn could explain Fergus' ecclesiastical activities. In effect, his religious foundations may evince attempts to assert his authority in the region. While the foundation of an episcopal see {{seems to have been a}} means by which Fergus sought to reinforce his independence from the Scots, his remarkable support of reformed religious orders may have been <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> which he attempted to legitimise his regal aspirations.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1968, Oughton and Ayers {{became part}} of the Jesse James Gang, which banded {{together}} with about 40 others against the moderates. The Jesse James Gang replaced the University of Michigan SDS chapter, and Robbins, Oughton, and Ayers worked in partnership with Jim Mellen from the Revolutionary Youth Movement Group. The Vietnam War entered its third year in the middle of 1968. The early student movement had taken their moral stance from the teachings of Albert Camus, who taught that thinking men have the responsibility to find <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> the world to be neither a victim or the executioner. Four events in 1968 turned the American student movement into self-proclaimed Marxist–Leninist revolutionaries: the Viet Cong's Tet Offensive, the student sit-in at Columbia University, the near-revolution in France, and the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Each event helped change the way American radicals viewed their own situations.|$|E
25|$|Honing theory, {{developed}} principally by psychologist Liane Gabora, {{posits that}} creativity arises {{due to the}} self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview. The creative process is <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> which the individual hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview. Honing theory places emphasis {{not only on the}} externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process. When faced with a creatively demanding task, there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only is the task conceived of differently, but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge.|$|E

The pressures from the population placed on the new Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led to an uneasy alliance between him and President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Through this alliance they attempted to hinder the ulama's ability to gain further control of the state. In 1989, they created a sequence of constitutional amendments that removed the office of prime minister and increased the scope of presidential power. However, these new amendments did not curtail the powers of the Supreme Leader of Iran in any way; this position still contained the ultimate authority over the armed forces, the making of war and peace, the final say in foreign policy, and the right to intervene in the legislative process whenever he deemed it necessary.|$|E
25|$|Troubled by this paradox, Gerard 't Hooft {{analyzed}} the emission of Hawking radiation in more detail. He noted that when Hawking radiation escapes, there is <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> which incoming particles can modify the outgoing particles. Their gravitational field would deform {{the horizon of}} the black hole, and the deformed horizon could produce different outgoing particles than the undeformed horizon. When a particle falls into a black hole, it is boosted relative to an outside observer, and its gravitational field assumes a universal form. 't Hooft showed that this field makes a logarithmic tent-pole shaped bump on the horizon of a black hole, and like a shadow, the bump is an alternative description of the particle's location and mass. For a four-dimensional spherical uncharged black hole, the deformation of the horizon {{is similar to the}} type of deformation which describes the emission and absorption of particles on a string-theory world sheet. Since the deformations on the surface are the only imprint of the incoming particle, and since these deformations would have to completely determine the outgoing particles, 't Hooft believed that the correct description of the black hole would be by some form of string theory.|$|E
