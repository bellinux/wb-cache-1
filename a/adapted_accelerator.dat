40|$|We {{show that}} crystal can trap a broad (x, x', y, y', E) {{distribution}} of particles and channel it preserved {{with a high}} precision. This sampled-and-hold distribution can be steered by a bent crystal for analysis downstream. In simulations for the 7 TeV Large Hadron Collider, a crystal <b>adapted</b> to the <b>accelerator</b> lattice traps 90 % of diffractively scattered protons emerging from the interaction point with a divergence 100 times the critical angle. We set the criterion for crystal adaptation improving efficiency ~ 100 -fold. Proton angles are preserved in crystal transmission with accuracy down to 0. 1 microrad. This makes feasible a crystal application for measuring very forward protons at the LHC. Comment: 11 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} first series of {{patients}} treated by stereotactic radiation therapy for brain metastases in Switzerland. From August 1993 to December 1994, 19 patients were treated using a linear <b>accelerator</b> <b>adapted</b> for stereotactic treatment set-up. Most {{of the patients}} received combined treatment including external irradiation. The crude overall control rate for brain metastases was 79 %. Median survival was 12. 2 months. Overall survival at one year was 50 +/- 12 %. These data compare reasonably well with the reported median survival of 3 - 6 months using external cranial irradiation alone. There was no "late toxicity". The data thus indicate that stereotactic radiation therapy combined with external whole brain irradiation appears to increase life expectancy {{and quality of life}} in a selected cohort of patients...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} use of {{stereotactic}} radiosurgery delivered through an <b>adapted</b> linear <b>accelerator</b> [stereotactic multiple arc radiation therapy (SMART) ] for pituitary adenomas not cured by conventional therapy. All 21 patients had undergone conventional radiotherapy (45 - 50 Gy); 18 had also undergone prior surgery. This cohort comprised 13 patients with somatotrope adenomas, four with corticotrope adenomas, one with a lactotrope adenoma, and three with nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (median follow-up: 33 months, range: 3 - 72 months). SMART has proven effective, safe, and rapidly acting. We observed an accelerated reduction in GH and IGF-I levels in acromegaly, with normalization of GH and IGF-I levels in 58 %. Mean GH fell from 21. 1 mU/liter to 7. 9 mU/liter (7 ng/ml to 2. 6 ng/ml, P < 0. 01, median 25 months) faster than our predicted fall to 50 % at 2 yr with conventional radiotherapy. Mean IGF-I fell from 624 ng/ml to 384 ng/ml (P < 0. 001). Tumor growth was controlled in two of three nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas, and three of four corticotrope adenomas. There were no adverse effects from SMART. Notably {{there have been no}} visual sequelae or further loss of anterior pituitary function in this heavily pretreated group. Our data indicate that SMART is an effective complementary therapy for pituitary adenomas that have displayed a suboptimal response to conventional therapy including external irradiation...|$|R
40|$|The new Bern {{cyclotron}} laboratory aims at industrial radioisotope {{production for}} PET diagnostics and multidisciplinary research {{by means of}} a specifically conceived beam transfer line, terminated in a separate bunker. In this framework, an innovative beam monitor detector based on doped silica and optical fibres has been designed, constructed, and tested. Scintillation light produced by Ce and Sb doped silica fibres moving across the beam is measured, giving information on beam position, shape, and intensity. The doped fibres are coupled to commercial optical fibres, allowing the read-out of the signal far away from the radiation source. This general-purpose device can be easily <b>adapted</b> for any <b>accelerator</b> used in medical applications and is suitable either for low currents used in hadrontherapy or for currents up to a few μA for radioisotope production, as well as for both pulsed and continuous beams...|$|R
40|$|The {{trajectory}} {{feedback of}} the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) {{is an essential}} mitigation method for ground motion effects at CLIC. In this paper signicant improvements of the design of this feedback are presented. The new controller {{is based on a}} singular value decomposition (SVD) of the orbit response matrix to decouple the in- and outputs of the accelerator. For each decoupled channel one independent controller is designed by utilising ground motion and noise models. This new design allows a relaxation of the required resolution of the beam position monitor from 10 to 50 nm. At the same time the suppression of ground motion effects is improved. As a consequence, the tight tolerances for the allowable luminosity loss due to ground motion effects in CLIC can be met. The presented methods can be easily <b>adapted</b> to other <b>accelerators</b> in order to loosen sensor tolerances and to efciently suppress ground motion effects...|$|R
40|$|Superconducting radio {{frequency}} (SRF) linacs {{have been one}} of the structures of choice in the intense proton accelerator and the heavy ion accelerator for intense neutron sources, nuclear transmutation, energy amplifiers, rare isotopes accelerator, etc. For these applications, there are strong demands of reduced-beta (β< 1) SRF cavity. In this paper two types of cavities are considered. One is the well-known multi-cell elliptical cavity <b>adapted</b> from electron <b>accelerator.</b> It has been shown that the multi-cell elliptical cavity is a very suitable structure for betas above 0. 5. Below this value, the operation would be difficult due to its weak mechanical characteristics. The other is the spoke cavity that is considered as a promising SRF cavity structure that could cover beta ranges from 0. 1 to 0. 5. General considerations and the related optimizations in the design and the corresponding analysis are studied by exploring physical parameter spaces of each cavity type, on the basis of design criteria...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Radiosurgery is an {{effective}} treatment for trigeminal neuralgia (TN) with minimal complications. Most experience is based on gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) {{and to a lesser}} extent on linear accelerators. METHODS: We report our initial experience in 17 patients with TN treated by an <b>adapted</b> linear <b>accelerator</b> using the BrainLab system. The trigeminal root entry zone immediately adjacent to the pons (target volume: 0. 01 - 0. 09 cm 3, mean: 0. 02 cm 3) was targeted by use of a multileaf collimator to deliver 40 - 45 Gy to the 80 % isodose (dose max 50 - 56 Gy). Median follow-up was 12 months (range: 1 - 60). RESULTS: All patients reported some initial improvement in level of pain after treatment (mean time: 1 month). Initial pain responses were as follows: 6 patients (35 %) had complete pain relief and required no medication, 6 (35 %) had occasional pain but were off medication, and 5 (30 %) experienced partial relief of pain but still required medication, usually in lower doses. Five patients (29 %) who experienced initial pain relief had recurrences ranging from 4 - 13 months after procedure. There were no major or minor complications of radiosurgery except one case of mild facial itching. CONCLUSION: Stereotactic radiosurgery using a linear accelerator appears to be effective and can be a favourable alternative to other procedures, including GKRS. The procedure is very safe and side effects are rare and minor. However, a randomised trial with a longer follow-up comparing radiosurgery to other surgical procedures is needed to assess the long term effectiveness of this treatmen...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{stability}} to the nanometre and below {{is required for}} the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) quadrupoles to frequencies as low as 1 Hz. An active stabilization and positioning system based on very stiff piezo electric actuators and inertial reference masses is under study for the Main Beam Quadrupoles (MBQ). The stiff support was selected for robustness against direct forces and for the option of incrementally repositioning the magnet with nanometre resolution. The technical feasibility was demonstrated by a representative test mass being stabilized and repositioned to the required level in the vertical and lateral direction. Technical issues were identified and the development programme of the support, sensors, and controller was continued to increase the performance, integrate the system in the overall controller, <b>adapt</b> to the <b>accelerator</b> environment, and reduce costs. The improvements are implemented in models, test benches, and design of the first stabilized prototype CLIC magnet. The characterization of vibration sources was extended to forces acting directly on the magnet, such as water-cooling induced vibrations. This paper shows the achievements, improvements, and an outlook on further R&D...|$|R
40|$|The ion optical {{properties}} of plasma-based final focusing and transport for a heavy ion ICF reactor are discussed. The advantages of plasma-based final focusing are mainly {{the structure of}} the field, the beam charge and current neutralization and the reduction of beam rigidity due to stripping of electrons in the lasma. Two possible focusing modes are considered; the first one, more traditional, is the so called coherent mode; {{it is based on the}} symmetric strong focusing which can be obtained with a cylindrical, or eventually shape optimized, short lens. The {{optical properties}} are in this case favorable compared to quadrupole lenses. The lens is, in particular, highly insensitive to chromatica aberrations. The disadvantage of this focusing scheme, in an ICF scenario, is the relativelt short focal length, which require a design with the lens integrated in the reactor chamber. A very interesting alternative is the use of a transport plasma channel, which can provide the required standoff distance from the pellet. In this case one can exploit the incoherent focusing of an adiabatic lens. The adiabatic lens has an extremely large acceptance both of the beam emittance and momentum spread. Two examples of final focusin and transport systems <b>adapted</b> to differen <b>accelerator</b> and target design are presented in detail...|$|R
40|$|In our {{research}} we specially <b>adapted</b> the multiplier <b>accelerator</b> approach {{for analysis of}} investment processes on the municipal level. We analyzed the databases of municipalities of the Bashkortostan Republic and found a one-year lag and ratchet effects {{in the development of}} investment processes, which manifested themselves through steady rates of growth in the volumes of shipped goods and services in these areas while the amount of investment was declining. Excessively high values of the investment accelerator in certain municipalities were explained, on the one hand, by the insignificant changes in the economic performance of these municipalities and, on the other hand, by the inflow of capital, which was not related to the incentive function of return from the previous investment. The main causes of the disincentive function include the low investment attractiveness of the territories; the poorly developed environment for investment stimulation; the inefficiency of the investment itself; and its short-term character. Our approach combines the multiplier accelerator theory with the concept of efficient management of investment in socio-economic systems of various levels and thus it has enabled us to develop a matrix for diagnostics of investment processes by calculating investment efficiency (with the help of the investment multiplier) and the focus of the investment process (with the help of the investment accelerator). Upon these results we have mapped municipalities according to their levels of investment development and proposed a differentiated approach to managerial decision-making. These findings can be used to study investment attractiveness on the municipal level and to develop guidelines for assessment of investment attractiveness and for managerial decision-making to enhance investment efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Background: Radiotherapy for {{patients}} suffering from malignant neoplasms has developed greatly {{during the past}} decades. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is one important radiotherapeutic option which is defined by a single and highly focussed application of radiation during a specified time interval. One of its important indications is the treatment of brain metastases. Objectives: The objective of this HTA is to summarise the current literature concerning the treatment of brain metastasis and to compare SRS as a single or additional treatment option to alternative treatment options {{with regard to their}} medical effectiveness/efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness as well as their ethical, social and legal implications. Methods: A structured search and hand search of identified literature are performed from January 2002 through August 2007 to identify relevant publications published in English or German. Studies targeting patients with single or multiple brain metastases are included. The methodological quality of included studies is assessed according to quality criteria, based on the criteria of evidence based medicine. Results: Of 1, 495 publications 15 medical studies meet the inclusion criteria. Overall study quality is limited and with the exception of two randomized controlleed trials (RCT) and two meta-analyses only historical cohort studies are identified. Reported outcome measures are highly variable between studies. Studies with high methodological quality provide evidence, that whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in addition to SRS and SRS in addition to WBRT is associated with improved local tumour control rates and neurological function. However, only in patients with single brain metastasis, RPA-class 1 (RPA = Recursive partitioning analysis) and certain primary tumour entities, this combination of SRS and WBRT is associated with superior survival compared to WBRT alone. Studies report no significant differences in adverse events between treatment groups. Methodologically less rigorous studies provide no conclusive evidence with regard to medical effectiveness and safety, comparing SRS to WBRT, neurosurgery (NS) or hypofractionated radiotherapy (HCSRT). The quality of life is not investigated in any of the studies. Within the searched databases a total of 320 economic publications are identified. Five publications are eligible for this report. The five reports have a quiet variable quality. Concerning the economic efficiency of alternative equipment, while assuming equal effectiveness, the calculations show, that economic efficiency depends to a large extend on the number of patients treated. In case the two alternative equipments are used solely for SRS, the Gamma Knife might be more cost-efficient. Otherwise an <b>adapted</b> linear <b>accelerator</b> is most likely to be beneficial because of its flexibility. One Health Technology Assessment (HTA) states, that the cost for a Gamma Knife and a dedicated linear accelerator are comparable, while an adapted version is cheaper. No reports concerning ethical, legal and social aspects are identified. Discussion: Overall, quantity and quality of identified studies is limited. However, the identified studies indicate that the prognosis of patients with brain metastases is despite highly developed and modern treatment regimes still limited. Conclusive evidence with regard to the effectiveness of identified interventions is only available for the combined treatment of SRS and WBRT compared to SRS or WBRT alone. Furthermore, there is insufficient evidence to compare SRS with WBRT, NS or HCSRT. The efficiency of the different equipments depends to a great extent on the number and the indications of the patients treated. If dedicated systems are used to their full capacity, there is some evidence for superior cost-effectiveness. If more treatment flexibility is required, adapted systems seem to be advantageous. However, equal treatment effectiveness is a necessary assumption for these conclusions. The need for a treatment precision can influence the purchase decision. No reports concerning more recent therapeutic alternatives are currently available. Conclusion: Combination of SRS and WBRT is associated with improved local tumour control and neurological function compared to SRS or WBRT alone. However, only {{for patients}} with single metastasis there is strong evidence that this results in improved survival compared to WBRT alone. Methodologically rigorous studies are warranted to investigate SRS compared to WBRT and NS and to investigate {{the quality of life in}} patients undergoing these treatment regimes. Concerning the type of equipment used, economic efficiency depends to a great extend on the capacity at which the system can be used. Dedicated systems might be favourable for a high number of patients, while lower patient counts probably favour adapted systems with their superior treatment flexibility. Using the equipment at its full capacity may result in a limited number of machines, what in turn may give rise to the question of an equal and easy access to this technology. Studies focusing on the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different treatment options and their combinations, especially for the German setting, are warranted...|$|R
