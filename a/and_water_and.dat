5|$|According to {{the account}} of Onofrio Panvinio, Cardinal John of Toledo {{suggested}} that the roof be removed ("Let us uncover the Room, else the Holy Ghost will never get at us"—the first recorded reference {{to the notion that}} the Holy Spirit should guide cardinal electors), which the two magistrates readily obliged.

5|$|After {{the floods}} receded, Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo ordered the Department of National Defense to utilize all {{resources}} {{to assist the}} people affected by the floods. More than 94,000people stayed at 896shelters after being evacuated due to the floods. The federal government allocated $234million (2.34 billion pesos) in relief, which was smaller than the damage total. Widespread medical teams assisted {{tens of thousands of}} homes, and due to prevention measures, there were no outbreaks of diseases. Roads and electrical systems were gradually restored, and students returned to school after repairs were made. Residents throughout Mexico sent supplies to the Mexican Red Cross, including 500tons of food <b>and</b> <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> international agencies sent money and supplies to the flood victims.|$|E

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{age of the}} {{household}} head shows negative correlation with soil <b>and</b> <b>water</b> conservation <b>and</b> seasonal migration at p <  1 and p <  10  % which means that a one unit increase {{in the age of}} the household decreases the probability of using soil <b>and</b> <b>water</b> conservation <b>and</b> seasonal migration by 0.7 and 0.8 times greater relative to the base category. This implies that older farmers’ are less likely to take soil <b>and</b> <b>water</b> conservation <b>and</b> seasonal migration which require more labor. The probability of adapting soil <b>and</b> <b>water</b> conservation <b>and</b> seasonal migration decreases the older a farmer is. Thus, younger households’ are active and energized than older households’ in the application of soil <b>and</b> <b>water</b> conservation <b>and</b> seasonal migration as a strategy. This finding is in agreement with Madison (2006) who noted that older households’ are less likely to use the two adaptation measures compared with younger ones.|$|R

5|$|Cockroaches {{are social}} insects; {{a large number}} of species are either gregarious or {{inclined}} to aggregate, and a slightly smaller number exhibit parental care. It used to be thought that cockroaches aggregated because they were reacting to environmental cues, but it is now believed that pheromones are involved in these behaviors. Some species secrete these in their feces with gut microbial symbionts being involved, while others use glands located on their mandibles. Pheromones produced by the cuticle may enable cockroaches to distinguish between different populations of cockroach by odor. The behaviors involved have only been studied in a few species, but German cockroaches leave fecal trails with an odor gradient. Other cockroaches follow such trails to discover sources of food <b>and</b> <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> where other cockroaches are hiding. Thus, cockroaches have emergent behavior, in which group or swarm behavior emerges from a simple set of individual interactions.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{classify}} Little Gidding as a poem of {{fire with}} an emphasis on purgation and the Pentecostal fire. The beginning of the poem discusses time and winter, with attention paid to the arrival of summer. The images of snow, which provoke desires for a spiritual life, transition into an analysis of the four classical elements of fire, earth, air <b>and</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> how fire is the primary element of the four. Following this is a discussion on death and destruction, things unaccomplished, and regret for past events.|$|E
5|$|During {{the post-war}} boom, {{the methods used}} to set up {{business}} in South Australia were unique. Playford's government would charge little to no business tax, supply cheap electricity, land <b>and</b> <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> have the Housing Trust build the factories and workers' homes. Consumer goods and automotive factories were created in the northern and western suburbs of Adelaide; mining, steel and shipbuilding industries appeared in the 'Iron Triangle' towns of Whyalla, Port Pirie and Port Augusta. Prices and wages were kept relatively low to enable continued investment, and South Australia was slower than the other states to abolish these wartime measures to increase its industrial competitiveness. The government initiatives managed to overcome the large logistic burden, as Adelaide and South Australia were far from the markets where the goods would be sold.|$|E

5|$|Mloukhiyeh is a stew {{made from}} Corchorus. The Corchorus is picked during harvest time, and is either frozen or dried.

5|$|Pure {{alkali metals}} are dangerously {{reactive}} with air <b>and</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> {{must be kept}} away from heat, fire, oxidising agents, acids, most organic compounds, halocarbons, plastics, and moisture.

Some Class D dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are effective, depriving the fire of oxygen and cooling the alkali metal.|$|E
5|$|Salt {{has long}} held an {{important}} place in religion and culture.

The ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans invoked their gods with offerings of salt <b>and</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> some people think this to be the origin of Holy Water in the Christian faith. In Aztec mythology, Huixtocihuatl was a fertility goddess who presided over salt and salt water.|$|E

5|$|Scientists {{studying}} the horses rate their body condition {{on a scale}} of one (excellent) to five (very poor), based mainly on estimated weight and muscle tone. The horses tend to remain in above average condition, despite the harsh environment in which they live, with stallions generally averaging better condition then mares. During severe droughts, the average body score decreases, but even then horses are found with moderate body scores and the entire population is never in very poor condition. The condition of the horses is directly correlated to rainfall, through a correlation to available forage, though temperature, distance between forage <b>and</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> individual energy expenditures also play a role. Studies during the 1990s found no evidence of equine disease among the population and few external parasites. Investigations of carcasses found four internal nematode parasites present (strongyles, small and large pinworms and Ascarids), as well as the larvae of botflys.|$|E
5|$|Silver metal {{is a good}} {{catalyst}} for oxidation reactions; {{in fact it is}} somewhat too good for most purposes, as finely divided silver tends to result in complete oxidation of organic substances to carbon dioxide <b>and</b> <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> hence coarser-grained silver tends to be used instead. For instance, 15% silver supported on α-Al2O3 or silicates is a {{catalyst for}} the oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide at 230–270°C. Dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde is conducted at 600–720°C over silver gauze or crystals as the catalyst, as is dehydrogenation of isopropanol to acetone. In the gas phase, glycol yields glyoxal and ethanol yields acetaldehyde, while organic amines are dehydrated to nitriles.|$|E
5|$|The Shabbat and festival breads of the Yemenite Jews {{have become}} popular in Israel {{and can be}} bought frozen in supermarkets. Jachnun is very thinly rolled dough, brushed with oil or fat and baked {{overnight}} at a very low heat. It is traditionally served with a crushed or grated tomato dip, hard boiled eggs and skhug. Malawach is a thin circle of dough toasted in a frying pan. Kubaneh is a yeast dough baked overnight and traditionally served on Shabbat morning. Lahoh is a spongy, pancake-like bread made of fermented flour <b>and</b> <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> fried in a pan. Jews from Ethiopia make a similar bread called injera from millet flour.|$|E
