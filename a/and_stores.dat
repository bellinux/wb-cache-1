5|$|During July 1914, Australia {{and other}} {{units of the}} RAN fleet were on a {{training}} cruise in Queensland waters. On 27 July, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board learned through press telegrams that the British Admiralty thought {{that there would be}} imminent and widespread war in Europe following the July Crisis, and had begun to position its fleets as a precaution. Three days later, the Board learned that the official warning telegram had been sent: at 22:30, Australia was recalled to Sydney to take on coal <b>and</b> <b>stores.</b>|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} night of the battle, the {{garrison}} at Malakand North had not seen much action despite being in the more exposed position, and had spent much of the night firing flares and manoeuvring artillery units. In response Meiklejohn ordered a reconnaissance of the vicinity, whereupon Major Gibbs, the commander of the force, encountered large groups of tribesmen in the valley. Subsequently, he was eventually ordered to collect his forces <b>and</b> <b>stores</b> from Malakand North, and transfer them into the southern camp.|$|E
5|$|Game Capture HD, which {{connects to}} gaming {{consoles}} to record gameplay, {{was introduced in}} 2012. It was created in response to gamers that were hacking EyeTV products for gameplay recording. The device connects between a gaming console and the TV and {{is powered by a}} USB connection. It captures video as the console sends it to the television, compresses <b>and</b> <b>stores</b> it. A review in iPhone Life gave it 4 out of 5 stars and noted that it could also be used to record iPad games with the right setup.|$|E
5|$|In 1785 Barbary pirates, {{most notably}} from Algiers, began to seize American {{merchant}} {{vessels in the}} Mediterranean. In 1793 alone, eleven American ships were captured and their crews <b>and</b> <b>stores</b> held for ransom. To combat this problem, proposals were made for warships to protect American shipping, resulting in the Naval Act of 1794. The act provided funds to construct six frigates, but included a clause that if peace terms were agreed to with Algiers, {{the construction of the}} ships would be halted.|$|E

5|$|Llywelyn {{responded by}} {{intervening}} {{with his own}} forces but outright conflict was prevented by the diplomatic efforts of Henry III. De Clare continued building work and in 1270 Llywelyn responded by attacking and burning the site, probably destroying the temporary defences <b>and</b> <b>stores.</b> De Clare began work again the following year, raising tensions and prompting Henry to send two bishops, Roger de Meyland and Godfrey Giffard, {{to take control of}} the site and arbitrate a solution to the dispute.|$|E
5|$|On 19 April {{orders were}} issued for the ANZACs to stop training, {{and for all}} ships and small boats to take on coal <b>and</b> <b>stores,</b> in {{preparation}} for a landing originally scheduled to occur on 23 April. Weather conditions delayed their departure from Lemnos until dawn on 24 April. The Royal Navy battleships Queen, Triumph, Prince of Wales, London, and Majestic, the cruiser Bacchante, seven destroyers and four transport ships led the way carrying the 3rd Brigade.

5|$|Several old {{building}}s, which {{date from}} the 1880s, remain at Underfall Yard and have listed building status. The octagonal brick and terracotta chimney of the hydraulic engine house dates from 1888, and is grade II* listed, as is the hydraulic engine house itself. It is built of red brick with a slate roof and contains pumping machinery, installed in 1907 by Fullerton, Hodgart and Barclay of Paisley, which powers the dock's hydraulic system of cranes, bridges and locks. The former pattern-maker's shop <b>and</b> <b>stores</b> {{date from the}} same period and are grade II listed, as are the Patent slip and quay walls.|$|E
5|$|The Jaguar International had {{the unusual}} {{optional}} provision for overwing pylons, used for short-range air-to-air missiles, {{such as the}} Matra R550 Magic or the AIM-9 Sidewinder. This option frees up the under-wing pylons for other weapons <b>and</b> <b>stores.</b> RAF Jaguars gained overwing pylons in the buildup to Operation Granby in 1990, but French Jaguars were not modified. The RAF's Jaguar 97s were intended to be wired for the carriage of ASRAAMs on the overwing launchers, but clearance of this weapon was never completed because of funding cuts.|$|E

5|$|The Square {{has been}} the home for TKTS (originally known as the Official London Half-Price Theatre Ticket Booth), since 1980. Tickets for theatre {{performances}} taking place around the West End that day and during the week are sold from the booth at a significant discount. The popularity of the booth {{has given rise to}} other booths <b>and</b> <b>stores</b> around the Square that advertise half-price tickets for West End shows. The Official London Theatre Guide recommends avoiding these booths as they are not official and do not contain the Society of Ticket Agents & Retailers (STAR) logo.|$|E
5|$|The {{algorithm}} {{accepts a}} 32-bit floating-point number as the input <b>and</b> <b>stores</b> a halved value for later use. Then, treating the bits representing the floating-point number as a 32-bit integer, a logical shift right by one bit is performed {{and the result}} subtracted from the magic number 0x5F3759DF. This is the first approximation of the inverse square root of the input. Treating the bits again as a floating-point number, it runs one iteration of Newton's method, yielding a more precise approximation.|$|E
