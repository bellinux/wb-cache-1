500|$|During {{the night}} of 4/5 November, the Chinese and North Koreans mounted a {{full-scale}} assault on the US 24th Infantry Division, pushing back an American infantry regiment nearly [...] The Chinese force subsequently turned west, advancing between the Taeryong and Chongchon rivers and threatening {{the rear of the}} 27th British Commonwealth Brigade by cutting the Pakchon–Sinanju road. The following day they attacked an American artillery battery which was guarding a vital concrete bridge near Kujin. The British and Australians then successfully counter-attacked the Chinese forces occupying a number of nearby ridgelines during the day but were in turn counter-attacked before being pushed off the high ground during the night. In their first battle with the Chinese, the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) captured a well defended hill with only limited offensive support, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the face of heavy counter-attacks before confused command decisions resulted in a disorganised night withdrawal while still in contact. The withdrawal threatened to open the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade's left flank and the Australians were ordered to immediately reposition on the ridge, yet ultimately {{it was too late to}} regain the feature in darkness. However, following heavy fighting the pressure on the Australians unexpectedly ceased after midnight, and parties of Chinese were observed beginning to withdraw. By early morning the Chinese attack had been checked and 3 RAR had redeployed to new positions in the paddy fields around the railway crossing north of Maenjung-dong.|$|E
2500|$|Eager {{to control}} the price of wheat, 46,000 farmers joined {{together}} in 1923–4 {{to set up the}} [...] "Saskatchewan Co-operative Wheat Producers"—the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool—that bought nearly everyone's wheat <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> elevators for the best price. The pool collapsed financially in 1931 and the federal government had to cover the losses; the coop continued as a network of elevators owned by the farmers. It advanced the reform agenda for agricultural development, with full-time district representatives, or fieldmen, who promoted education, demonstrations of farm equipment, community picnics and rallies, and cooperative insurance, among other programs.|$|E

2500|$|Twelve police {{officers}} responded to an incident involving a pool party at Craig Ranch, an {{upper middle class}} neighborhood in McKinney. The incident was described by police as a disturbance involving around 100 teens, mostly African American, at a private pool party where various teens jumped the fence after a local radio station promoted the party at this private pool over social media. Later, in the street, Casebolt pushed a teenager dressed in a bikini to the ground after the girl was asked to leave multiple times. When two black teenage bystanders attempted to interfere, the officer drew his handgun <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a [...] "low ready" [...] position as the teens retreated. Casebolt was also heard cursing. The entire event was captured {{on a cell phone}} camera by a teenager who lives in the neighborhood.|$|E
2500|$|After {{being placed}} in storage, the statue {{was moved to the}} 1878 Chicago Interstate Exposition where it {{remained}} unsold. The sculpture was acquired by a gambler by the name of [...] "Blind John" [...] Condon who purchased it from a saloon on Clark street to mark the grave of a Racehorse named [...] "Cleopatra". [...] The grave was in front of the grandstand of his Harlem race track in the Chicago suburb of Forest Park, where the sculpture remained until it was moved to a construction storage yard in Cicero. [...] While at the storage yard, The Death of Cleopatra sustained extensive damage at the hands of well-meaning Boy Scouts who painted and caused other damage to the sculpture. Dr. James Orland, a dentist in Forest Park, and member of the Forest Park Historical Society acquired the sculpture <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> private storage at the Forest Park Mall.|$|E
2500|$|Fort St David, {{situated}} on the River Gadilam near Devanampattinam and acquired in 1653 AD by Elihu Yale, a Christian slave-trader and cruel slave master, {{is one of the}} most visited tourist attraction in Cuddalore. The wealth embezzled and extracted by him was infused into the famed Yale University, an Ivy League university in USA. Only two decades later, in 1677, when Shivaji captured Gingee, the fort fell into the hands of the Marathas. In 1690, the British East India Company purchased the fort and the adjacent villages (within [...] "ye randome shott of a piece of ordnance".) A great gun was fired to different points of the compass and all the country within its range, including the town of Cuddalore, passed into the possession of the English. The villages thus obtained are called [...] "cannon ball villages". The fortifications were strengthened in 1693, 1698, 1702, 1725, 1740 and 1745. In 1746 Fort St. David became the British headquarters for British India. The British ruled a greater part of south India (Tamil Nadu, parts of present-day Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka) from Fort St. David. An attack by Dupleix was successfully repulsed. In 1756, Clive was appointed governor. The French captured the fort in 1758 but in 1760 relinquished it to Sir Eyre Coote of the British East India Company. The French recaptured the fort in 1782 <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 1783 during the Battle of Cuddalore. In 1785 the fort passed into British possession. By this time, however, the centre of British rule was Fort St George.|$|E
