25|$|There {{followed}} {{in quick succession}} two musicals which have secured Kelly's reputation as a major figure in the American musical film, An American in Paris (1951) and – probably {{the most popular and}} admired of all film musicals – Singin' in the Rain (1952). As co-director, lead star and choreographer, Kelly was the central driving force. Johnny Green, head of music at MGM at the time, said of him:Gene is easygoing as long as you know exactly what you are doing when you're working with him. He's a hard taskmaster <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> hard work. If you want to play on his team you'd better like hard work, too. He isn't cruel but he is tough, and if Gene believed in something he didn't care who he was talking to, whether it was Louis B. Mayer or the gatekeeper. He wasn't awed by anybody, and he had a good record of getting what he wanted.|$|E
500|$|After the race, Secretariat {{was brought}} to Aqueduct Racetrack where he was paraded with Turcotte dressed in the Meadow silks before a crowd of 32,990 in his final public appearance. [...] "It's a sad day, and yet it's a great day", said Laurin. [...] "I {{certainly}} wish he could run as a 4-year-old. He's a great horse <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> to run." ...|$|E
500|$|The English tour raised {{little money}} but {{restored}} Wagner's spirits. On his return he {{began work on}} what {{would prove to be}} his final stage work, Parsifal, a project that would occupy him for most of the next five years. Cosima's influence was such that Wagner asserted that he would not have written another note, had she not been there. On a practical level, when the festival's creditors began to press for payment, Cosima's personal plea to Ludwig in 1878 persuaded the king to provide a loan to pay off the outstanding debt and {{open the door to the}} prospect of a second Bayreuth Festival. For Cosima's birthday on 25 December 1878, Wagner hired an orchestra to play the newly composed prelude to Parsifal. The concert also included the Siegfried Idyll; Cosima wrote afterwards: [...] "There stands he who has called forth these wonders, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> me. He loves me!".|$|E

60|$|There {{was still}} another whose face was {{constantly}} before him, and {{the reflection of}} her distressed yet undaunted soul,--Alison Parr. The contemplation of her courage, of her determination to abide by nothing save the truth, had had a power over him {{that he might not}} estimate, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> her as a man loves a woman, for her imperfections. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> her body <b>and</b> her mind.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>loved</b> her <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> Rome! But his god {{called to}} him <b>and</b> <b>he,</b> the proud Roman patrician, the {{accepted}} lord of the Augusta and of Rome, followed as would a slave.|$|R
500|$|On 13 April 1962, Kirchherr met {{the group}} at Hamburg Airport, telling them that Sutcliffe had died a few days before. Sutcliffe's mother flew to Hamburg with the Beatles' manager Brian Epstein, and {{returned}} to Liverpool with her son's body. Sutcliffe's father did not hear of his son's death for three weeks, as he was sailing to South America, although the family arranged for a padre to tell him when he docked in Buenos Aires. After Sutcliffe's death, Kirchherr {{wrote a letter to}} his mother, apologising for being too ill to attend his funeral in Liverpool and saying how much she and Lennon missed him: [...] "Oh, Mum, he (Lennon) is in a terrible mood now, he just can't believe that darling Stuart never comes back. [...] just crying his eyes out... John is marvellous to me, he says that he knows Stuart so much <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> him so much that he can understand me." ...|$|E
500|$|Into Temptation {{marks the}} second film by {{independent}} filmmaker Patrick Coyle, who {{wrote and directed}} the 2003 drama film Detective Fiction. Coyle said Into Temptation was partially inspired by his father, James Patrick Coyle, a kind but belligerent {{man who had been}} encouraged by his mother to become a priest. James entered seminary but dropped out before ordination after he was drafted into serving overseas in World War II and met Margaret Mary Quinlan, who would become his wife and Patrick Coyle's mother. Coyle conceived of the script for Into Temptation while imagining what kind of priest his father would have been. His father strongly approved of the project, and told Coyle, [...] "Go make that movie. And tell the truth." [...] Coyle was also partially inspired by his childhood pastor and friend, the Reverend Damian Zuerlein, who performed the marriage ceremony for Coyle and his wife and baptized their children. Coyle said of him, [...] "He's just a young, energetic, competent, committed, devoted man working with a poor parish. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> his work. I was inspired by that." [...] Coyle said when writing Into Temptation, he did not intend to make a religious film, and said of protagonist Father John Buerlein, [...] "The character could have been a minister or a rabbi or a public defender. He's a good man trying to do a job the best he can." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{creating}} the character, Fazekas said the writers [...] "wanted {{to be really}} specific about who the woman is that Jarvis is just madly in love with" [...] in order to highlight the strong, platonic relationship Jarvis has with Carter. Fazekas added, [...] "It makes sense in that, Jarvis likes Peggy Carter, so of course the woman he's in love with {{would not be a}} quiet, prim and proper lady ... We also wanted to be very clear that Peggy and Ana really like each other, and that there's no jealousy from Ana. Ana and Jarvis are so comfortable in their relationship, they're not going to be jealous of other people coming in and out of their lives." [...] On some of the differences between Ana and Edwin, Verbeek said, [...] "The first scene we had I walk in and I smack him on his ass, which is a sort of sexual, playful, fun thing they have. That's not something he would do, that's something she does, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> it." [...] D'Arcy later revealed that Verbeek had improvised this on their first day on set, after having [...] " [...] flown in", calling it [...] "brilliantly courageous ... to do it to an actor you don’t know" [...] and [...] "so perfectly what they were hoping that Ana would be like." ...|$|E
40|$|Ion Vatamanu was a chemist, writer <b>and</b> public figure. <b>He</b> {{was equally}} passionate about both his chosen fields of activity: {{chemistry}} and poetry. Chemistry, with its perfect equilibrium of logic and precision, provided inspiration for lyrical creativity, whereas poetry writing enlivened his imagination and passion for chemistry. <b>He</b> <b>loved</b> his parents. <b>He</b> adored his wife Elena, whom he often gifted {{a sea of}} flowers. <b>He</b> <b>loved</b> his daughters Mihaela, Mariana, <b>and</b> Leontina. <b>He</b> <b>loved</b> life, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> people...|$|R

500|$|Snyder's [...] "Death of the Family" [...] {{describes}} the Joker as {{in love with}} Batman, although not in a traditionally romantic way. The Joker believes that Batman has not killed him because he makes Batman better, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> the villain for that. Batman comic book writer Peter Tomasi concurred, stating that the Joker's main {{goal is to make}} Batman the best that he can be. The Joker and Batman represent opposites: the extroverted Joker wears colorful clothing and embraces chaos, while the introverted, monochromatic Batman represents order and discipline. The Joker is often depicted as defining his existence through his conflict with Batman. In 1994's [...] "Going Sane", the villain tries to lead a normal life after Batman's (apparent) death, only to become his old self again when Batman reappears; in [...] "Emperor Joker", an apparently omnipotent Joker cannot destroy Batman without undoing himself. Since the Joker is simply [...] "the Joker", he believes that Batman is [...] "Batman" [...] (with or without the costume) and has no interest in what is behind Batman's mask, ignoring opportunities to learn Batman's secret identity. Given the opportunity to kill Batman, the villain demurs; he believes that without their game, winning is pointless. The character has no desire for typical criminal goals like money or power; his criminality is designed only to continue his game with Batman.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, {{a promotional}} video that {{involves}} SpongeBob promoting diversity and tolerance was criticized by two U.S. Christian evangelical groups, most notably Focus on the Family, {{because they saw}} the character was being used as an advocate for homosexuality though the video contained [...] "no reference to sex, sexual lifestyle or sexual identity." [...] The incident led to questions {{as to whether or}} not SpongeBob, his best friend Patrick, and the rest of the series' characters are homosexual characters. After this speculation and comments, Hillenburg repeated his assertion that sexual preference was never considered during the creation of the show. He clarified the issue and said [...] "We never intended them to be gay. I consider them to be almost asexual. We're just trying to be funny and this has got nothing to do with the show." [...] Tom Kenny and other production members were shocked and surprised that such an issue had arisen. Derek Drymon, the show's creative director until 2004, said, [...] "If SpongeBob holds hands with Patrick it's because he's his best friend <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> him. I think the whole thing is a part of a larger agenda to stigmatize gay people." [...] Focus on the Family founder James Dobson later stated that his comments were taken out of context and that his original complaints were not with SpongeBob or any of the characters in the video but with the organization that sponsored the video, the We Are Family Foundation. Dobson noted that the foundation had posted pro-homosexual material on its website, but later removed it.|$|E
2500|$|Prince Oberyn Martell, nicknamed [...] "The Red Viper", {{is played}} by Chilean-American actor Pedro Pascal. [...] "This was a tough one", said showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss about the casting. [...] "The Red Viper is sexy and charming, yet believably dangerous; {{intensely}} likable, yet driven by hate. The boys love him, the girls love him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> them all back. Unless your last name is Lannister. We found a fellow who can handle the job description and make it seem effortless. He wasn't easy to find and he won't be easy to stop". Martin commented on the casting by saying: [...] "I wasn't present for Pedro Pascal's audition, but I understand that he really killed it with his reading. And since his casting was announced, the producer of another TV show on which he appeared recently has written me to say how terrific Pascal is, and to congratulate us on the casting. So I suspect that he {{will turn out to}} be a wonderful Red Viper". Actress Indira Varma was cast as Ellaria Sand, Prince Oberyn's paramour.|$|E

2500|$|Tony and Mandy begin a relationship. Dunn {{said that}} when she was first {{informed}} of the storyline she was surprised. She added that although she felt the pairing was unlikely, [...] "it did actually work". The pair marry and later have a child who they name Grace. Grace dies from suspected SIDS and the pair split. Pickard said [...] "If they hadn't lost a child, they might have stayed together the first time round. They were really happy before that happened". Dunn said that the storyline worked well, saying [...] "as much as it was really difficult. By that stage, Nick and I both knew how we would play things and it worked". Tony leaves Hollyoaks with Mandy and her daughter. Tony returns three months later without Mandy. Dunn explained the reason for Tony leaving Mandy saying: [...] "Mandy told Tony she couldn't have more children and he freaked out and left her in Laos". Dunn revealed Mandy wanted revenge for this. In 2011 Tony leaves the village and returns three months later having reinvented himself. Pickard said despite Tony's changes [...] "Tony is still the same person <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> Mandy". Speaking about the couple's future, Dunn told Taryn Davies of Femalefirst: [...] "they've been on and off for years and they're a great couple and I think that they make a great couple and I think it's such a shame that just as they get happy something horrendous happens again. So there's the possibility that their relationship might be re-kindled".|$|E
2500|$|Lewis {{completed}} her first headline tour The Labyrinth in July 2010 {{and soon after}} began making plans for her then-untitled third album. Recording and production officially began in late 2010 {{with a view to}} releasing the album in November 2011. Originally [...] "Collide," [...] a collaboration with Swedish DJ Avicii, was released in August 2011, with the album to follow in November. However Lewis was inspired to continue making music and used her Facebook account to announce that the album was being pushed back into early 2012. 26 March 2012 was confirmed as the new release date for Glassheart. To bridge the gap between Echo (2009) and Glassheart, Lewis teamed with British producer Fraser T Smith to record , an extended play (EP) of cover songs which was released in December. In January 2012, Lewis announced that the album was being pushed back again, this time to November 2012. During an interview with Digital Spy, Lewis confirmed that she had recorded with Scottish DJ Calvin Harris and that Smith had been brought on board to help with production. In April 2012, in an interview at the Ariella Couture fashion show, Lewis stated, [...] "I'm now planning to have the album out in the summer [...] Simon Cowell has heard some of the tracks <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> it". Cowell would later publicly offer his support, declaring to Lewis that although there's been a lengthy wait of two years for new music, [...] "I think this new album is sensational, you've never sounded better." ...|$|E
