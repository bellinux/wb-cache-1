5|$|The Incredible Hulk joined Toronto's Green-Screen initiative, to help cut carbon {{emissions}} and waste created during filming. Producer Gale Anne Hurd acknowledged the Hulk, being green, {{was a popular}} environmental analogy, and Norton himself was <b>an</b> <b>environmentalist.</b> Hybrid and fuel efficient vehicles were used, with low sulfur diesel as their energy source. The construction department used a sustainably harvested, locally sourced yellow pine instead of lauan for the sets, and also used zero-or low-VOC paint. The wood was generally recycled or given to environmental organizations, and paint cans were handed to waste management. In addition, they used cloth bags, biodegradable food containers, china and silverware food utensils, a stainless steel mug for each production crew member, a contractor who removed bins, recycled paper, biodegradable soap and cleaners in the trailers and production offices, and the sound department used rechargeable batteries. The Incredible Hulk became the first blockbuster film to receive the Environmental Media Association's Green Seal, which is displayed during the end credits.|$|E
