5|$|Most tern {{species are}} declining in numbers {{due to the}} loss or {{disturbance}} of breeding habitat, pollution and increased predation. Gull populations have increased {{over the last century}} because of reduced persecution and the availability of food from human activities, and terns have been forced out of many traditional nesting areas by the larger birds. A few species are defying the trend and showing local increases, including the Arctic tern in Scandinavia, Forster's tern around the Great Lakes, the Sandwich tern in eastern North <b>America</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> yellow-billed subspecies, the Cayenne tern, in the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the Galapagos shark as near threatened, as its low reproductive rate limits {{its capacity to}} withstand population depletion. There is no specific utilization data available, though this species is certainly caught by commercial fisheries operating across many parts of its range. The meat {{is said to be}} of excellent quality. While still common at areas such as Hawaii, the Galapagos shark may have been extirpated from sites around Central <b>America</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> fragmented distribution means other regional populations may also be at risk. The populations at the Kermadec and Galapagos Islands are protected within marine reserves.|$|E
5|$|In October, U.S. District Court Judge James Robart {{ordered that}} Path <b>America</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> assets {{be removed from}} Dargey's control and placed into receivership, {{including}} the Potala Tower project. A recovery plan was filed in January by the court receiver, proposing to sell all of Path America's projects, which Dargey and several investors opposed {{on the grounds of}} possible loss of EB-5 eligibility. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services instead revoked the Potala Tower project of EB-5 eligibility in March 2016, closing the possibility of granting green cards for project investors. The receiver was granted partial approval to sell the project in April; 13 bids were received for the property and/or project, including from local firm Vulcan Real Estate, Las Vegas-based Molasky Group, and Chinese developer and original investor Binjiang Tower Corporation. On May 20, 2016, Judge James Robart approved a plan submitted by the receiver on behalf of Molasky and Binjiang, committing $30 million to the project and allowing for construction to resume pending final approval by foreign investors; Dargey approved the plan after a deal was struck with the new developers to pay $1.8 million of the attorney fees he had accrued during the trial.|$|E

25|$|The Colorado River is a {{major source}} of water in the Southwest and many dams, such as the Hoover Dam, form {{reservoirs}} along it.

25|$|The {{impetus for}} the {{construction}} of New Tavern Fort came from the threat posed by the United Kingdom's adversaries in the American War of Independence - the newly created United States of <b>America</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> European allies, France and Spain. Serious weaknesses in British coastal defences had been revealed in 1778 by the American adventurer John Paul Jones in his raid on Whitehaven, Cumbria. The activities of his squadron on the British east coast the following year, along with the failed Franco-Spanish Armada of 1779, prompted the British government to commission a survey of the country's coastal defences. The state of the defences was found to be unacceptably deficient and plans were made for the building of 30 new batteries, positioned in an arc along the southern and eastern English coast from Norfolk to Cornwall.|$|E
25|$|Bifrenaria has {{traditionally}} been classified in subtribe Bifrenariinae of tribe Maxillarieae (Epidendroideae), however, the relationships among the several genera within this tribe are not well defined and changes are expected in the upcoming years. The genus closest to Bifrenaria is Rudolfiella. Other related genera are Teuscheria, Guanchezia, Hylaeorchis and Horvatia, {{in addition to the}} more distant Scuticaria and Xylobium. The unification of subtribes Lycastinae, Maxillariinae and Bifrenariinae has recently been suggested. However, there is no consensus on the path to be followed. Contrary to what was previously thought, the relationship among Bifrenaria and all these genera from Central America seems to indicate a primitive origin of Bifrenaria in Central <b>America</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> posterior dissemination towards the Southeast of Brazil, where it found fertile grounds to its more recent evolution.|$|E

In November 2001, Kathmandu airport went on high alert after threats that bin Laden planned to hijack a plane from there and crash it into a target in New Delhi. In 2002, US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, on a trip to Delhi, suggested that al-Qaeda was active in Kashmir though he did not have any hard evidence. He proposed hi tech ground sensors along the line of control to prevent militants from infiltrating into Indian administered Kashmir.|$|E
