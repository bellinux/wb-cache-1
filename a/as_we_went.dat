[...] Co-producer and co-screenwriter Roberto Orci addressed the issue of the casting saying, [...] "Basically, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> through the casting process and we began honing in on the themes of the movie, it became uncomfortable for me to support demonizing anyone of color, particularly any one of Middle Eastern descent or anyone evoking that. One of the points of the movie is that we must be careful about the villain within us, not some other race." ...|$|E
500|$|The pieces {{featured}} on Agharta {{were part of}} a typical set list for the group, but their performances of each sometimes changed almost beyond recognition from concert to concert. This, along with the track names, led to the widespread misunderstanding that the music was mostly or entirely improvised and unstructured. Lucas explained that the band started each performance with a [...] "very defined compositional basis" [...] before developing it further in a highly structured yet [...] "very free way"; the [...] "Right Off" [...] segment was improvised from the original recording's E-flat riff. Davis had the band play around a single chord in a piece for several minutes with variations as each member performed in a different time signature; Foster might have been playing in common time and Mtume in compound duple metre or septuple time, while the guitarists would comp in another tempo altogether. [...] "That's a lot of intricate shit we were working off this one chord", Davis remarked. From Lucas' perspective, this kind of [...] "structured improvisation" [...] resulted in significant interplay between the rhythm section and allowed the band to improvise [...] "a lot more than just the notes that were being played in the solos; we were improvising the entire song <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> along." ...|$|E

The only thing really frustrating for me, to be honest with you, is that sometimes people would write this idea that we were making it up <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> along and I wanted to say, 'Really?' But I think now people are writing and saying, 'Oh yeah!' I'm excited for people to see it on DVD, because now that they know how it ended, [...] go back and see all of the little things, like people who have no reflections in mirrors. When you go back, you will see everything was set up." [...] When asked if the House [...] "pulled" [...] the Harmons to it, Murphy responded, [...] "I don't know if they were targeted. I don't think the Internet site had any supernatural pull to it...although that would have been hilarious. I thought it was two things: it was house porn because I think that house really is extraordinary. And also I think there's always that allure in American lives of the fresh start, moving West, starting fresh." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Borderline" [...] {{was filmed}} on {{location}} in Los Angeles, California from January 30 to February 2, 1984 {{and was the first}} video that Madonna made with director Mary Lambert, who later also directed the videos [...] "Like a Virgin", [...] "Material Girl", [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] and [...] "Like a Prayer". Author Allen Metz noted how the video portrayed Madonna's then [...] "burgeoning star quality". It is regarded as one of her career-making moments when the video was started to be shown on MTV. She acted as the girlfriend of a Hispanic street guy who is picked up by a British photographer who publishes her picture on a magazine cover. The portrayal of the street life and high-fashion scene in the video was a reference to Madonna's life in the gritty, multiracial streets and clubs that she used to haunt while her career was beginning, as well as the world of popularity and success she was experiencing at that moment. The storyline involved her being emotionally torn between the photographer and her boyfriend. Madonna's boyfriend in the video is portrayed as Latino, and her struggles with this relationship depicted the struggle Hispanic women faced with their men. Lambert said that there was [...] "no formula" [...] used when making the [...] "Borderline" [...] video and that they were [...] "inventing it <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> along." [...] In the January 1997 issue of Rolling Stone, Lambert described the video and its plot as, [...] "Boy and girl enjoy simple pleasures of barrio love, girl is tempted by fame, boy gets huffy, girl gets famous, but her new beau's out-of-line reaction to a behavioral trifle (all she did was to spray-paint his expensive sports car) drives her back to her true love." ...|$|E

As stated Jordan [...] "DJ Swivel Young, this period is accountable for the [...] "Fela [...] influence" [...] in the song; this influence is further illustrated in its instrumentation that includes horns and percussion instruments. At the beginning, the production team played music with the band as they experimented with horns, percussion, drums, guitars and keys. DJ Swivel explained: [...] "We'd be taking loops, like a section of percussion — congas for example — and then using them on a completely different record; and that record might be a completely different tempo or in a different key, so we'd literally be pitching it <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went.</b> I used Elastic Audio [...] to fit and stretch it.

2500|$|When the {{publication}} of his second novel, Sometimes a Great Notion in 1964, required his presence in New York, Kesey, Neal Cassady, and others in a group of friends they called the Merry Pranksters took a cross-country trip in a school bus nicknamed Further. This trip, described in The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test (and later in Kesey's unproduced screenplay, The Further Inquiry) was the group's attempt to create art out of everyday life, and to experience roadway America while high on LSD. In an interview after arriving in New York, Kesey is quoted as saying, [...] "The sense of communication in this country has damn near atrophied. But we found <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> along it got easier to make contact with people. If people could just understand it is possible to be different without being a threat." [...] A huge amount of footage was filmed on 16mm cameras during the trip which remained largely unseen until the release of Alex Gibney's Magic Trip in 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Three weeks later, on 30 April 1864, {{the measure}} of devotion to the Hauhau {{movement}} displayed itself in the reckless march by 200 warriors on the Sentry Hill redoubt, 9km north-east of New Plymouth, in a one-sided battle that cost the lives of possibly {{a fifth of the}} Māori force. The redoubt had been built in late 1863 by Captain W. B. Messenger and 120 men of the Military Settlers on the crown of a hill that was the site of an ancient pā, and garrisoned by a detachment of 75 men from the 57th Regiment under Captain Shortt, with two Coehorn mortars. The construction of the outpost was regarded by the Atiawa as a challenge, being built close to the Māori position at Manutahi and on their land. In April 1864 a war party was formed of the best fighting men from the west coast iwi that had joined the rapidly spreading Hauhau movement. In a 1920 interview with historian James Cowan, Te Kahu-Pukoro, a fighter {{who took part in the}} attack, explained: [...] "The Pai-marire religion was then new, and we were all completely under its influence and firmly believed in the teaching of Te Ua and his apostles.
