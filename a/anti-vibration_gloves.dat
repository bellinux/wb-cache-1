50|$|Adaptive aids can {{be useful}} in {{enabling}} individuals with CTS to participate in their chosen activities. One such adaptation is increasing the diameter of handles so that less grip strength is needed to grasp an object. Any handle can be built up in this way. For example, someone who has CTS may have difficulty holding their toothbrush or utensils while eating. Therapists can easily adapt these tools or purchase already adapted tools for a client. Specific risk factors that can contribute to CTS such as vibration can be reduced by introducing new tools with lower vibration levels as well as <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>gloves.</b>|$|E
40|$|Wearing <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>gloves</b> {{is one of}} {{preventive}} measures recommended to reduce exposure to hand-arm vibration. But {{what do we know}} about the effectiveness of these <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>gloves</b> and about the workers’ acceptance? One literature review has been carried out in Medline (PubMed) and EBSCOhost, for the period from 1970 to 2014. A field study with questionnaires and interviews was done involving 30 workers that were invited to wear two types of <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>gloves,</b> for a short period of time each. Twenty-three (23) questionnaires about comfort and drawbacks of wearing <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>gloves</b> were completed. Twelve (12) individual interviews were analysed. Both types of suggested gloves were considered uncomfortable and, according to several workers, they hindered the performance of the job. Furthermore, the literature review reveals that the effectiveness of the gloves to reduce vibrations is low. Reducing hand-arm vibration exposure by wearing <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>gloves</b> has not been demonstrated. For the workers, the major problems are related with a decreasing dexterity, a discomfort and a disturbance at performing their jobs...|$|E

"Steel {{bucking bars}} used in sheet metal {{assembly}} tasks lack application of ergonomic principles. Four bucking bar interventions were evaluated and {{compared to a}} steel bucking bar. The interventions included a tungsten bucking bar, Viscolas® rubber wrap adhered to a steel bucking bar, a steel bar paired with an <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>glove,</b> and a steel bar with a detachable handle. All interventions and the steel bar were evaluated for vibration transmitted to the hand and elbow, relative muscle activity of the flexor and extensor muscle groups of the forearms, and usability. Vibration data collected at the hand revealed that the steel bucking bar transmitted the most vibration and the tungsten bucking bar transmitted the least. Transmission of vibration to the hand using the detachable handle was comparable to the tungsten bucking bar. All bucking bar interventions {{failed to meet the}} ANSI S 2. 70 standard for vibration exposure at the hand. Vibration measured at the elbow revealed that the tungsten bucking bar and the handle transmitted the least amount of vibration while the steel bucking bar and the steel bar with the Viscolas® wrap transmitted the most vibration to the elbow. The <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>glove</b> transmitted more vibration than the tungsten bar and the handle, but overall, less vibration was transmitted using the <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>glove</b> than the steel bar at both the hand and elbow. Electromyography (EMG) was used to measure relative muscle activity of the flexor and extensor muscle groups. There {{were no significant differences between}} any of the interventions or the steel bar for the extensor muscle group. However, the handle produced the least amount of relative forearm flexor muscle activity. In terms of usability, participants perceived less exertion using the tungsten bucking bar and were more likely to recommend the tungsten bucking bars to others. Half of the participants ranked the tungsten bucking bar as their first choice of all the interventions tested. The handle and the wrap were also considered usable by most participants. Participants perceived the most exertion using the steel bucking bar and were less likely to recommend it to others. Vibration, EMG, and usability measures were also analyzed for differences between asymptomatic and symptomatic participants. Relative flexor muscle activity was found to be significantly different between the two groups. Symptomatic participants required less flexor muscle activity to grip the handle during the bucking task comparable to muscle activity levels in asymptomatic participants. The <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>glove</b> produced the highest mean flexor muscle activity in symptomatic participants. Conversely, the glove produced the lowest mean flexor muscle activity in asymptomatic participants. In conclusion, the steel bucking bar transmitted more vibration to the hand and elbow and was not considered usable in terms of preference and perceived exertion. The tungsten bucking bar decreased vibration transmission to the hand and elbow without increased relative grip muscle activity. Decreased flexor muscle activity was observed for the handle and was especially pronounced in symptomatic participants. In general, the <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>glove</b> and Viscolas® wrap did transmit less vibration than the steel bucking bar alone. However, these types of interventions may be better suited for damping high frequency, low impact vibration...|$|R
40|$|In International Standard 10819 (1996), the {{requirements}} for a glove to be considered an ‘anti-vibration glove’ {{are determined by the}} transmission of vibration to the palm of the hand. The transmission of vibration to a finger {{is very different from the}} transmission of vibration to the palm, but there are currently no requirements to measure the transmission of vibration through gloves to the fingers. This study investigated the effects of material dynamic properties on the transmission of vibration to the palm of the hand and to the fingers. Two materials (foam material from one <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>glove</b> and gel material from another <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>glove)</b> were investigated. Subjects placed their palms or index fingers on the material and pushed down with a force of 10 N while the transmission of random vibration was measured over the frequency range 5 to 500 Hz. At frequencies greater than 20 Hz, both materials attenuated vibration to the palm of the hand but amplified vibration to the finger. The study shows that the materials in gloves can both attenuate and amplify the transmission of vibration, depending on the material, the frequency of vibration, and the location on the hand (palm or finger...|$|R
40|$|It {{might be}} assumed that {{increasing}} the thickness of a glove would reduce the vibration transmitted to the hand. Three material samples from an <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>glove</b> were stacked to produce three thicknesses: 6. 4, 12. 8 and 19. 2  mm. The dynamic stiffnesses of all three thicknesses, the apparent mass at the palm and the finger and the transmission of vibration to the palm and finger were measured. At frequencies from 20 to 350  Hz, the material reduced vibration at the palm but increased vibration at the finger. Increased thickness reduced vibration at the palm but increased vibration at the finger. The measured transmissibilities could be predicted from the material dynamic stiffness and the apparent mass of the palm and finger. Reducing the dynamic stiffness of glove material may increase or decrease the transmission of vibration, depending on the material, the frequency of vibration {{and the location of}} measurement (palm or finger). Practitioner Summary: Transmission of vibration through gloves depends on the dynamic response of the hand and the dynamic stiffness of glove material, which depends on material thickness. Measuring the transmission of vibration through gloves to the palm of the hand gives a misleading indication of the transmission of vibration to the fingers. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The mean {{vibration}} transmissibility {{values were}} measured for cotton work gloves {{commonly used in}} vibration-generating workplaces to evaluate the vibration isolating performance of cotton work gloves. The mean vibration transmissibility values of work cotton gloves were {{compared with those of}} four types of <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>gloves</b> measured in the same way. All the measurements were performed based on the newly issued JIS T 8114 that is identical to ISO 10819. Also, linear transmissibility values were calculated from the measured data. Cotton work glove samples did not satisfy the requirements specified in JIS T 8114. All the test samples showed mean vibration transmissibility values of more than 1. 0 for spectra M and H. In contrast, all the <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>gloves</b> tested in this study satisfied the JIS T 8114 requirements. The linear transmissibility values of cotton work gloves were consistently higher than those of <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>gloves</b> for spectrum H. The linear transmissibility values of cotton work gloves were steady at about 0. 9 up to 200 Hz, then increased with vibration frequency to about 1. 0 at 400 Hz. In contrast, the linear transmissibility values of <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>gloves</b> increased with frequency to 1. 0 at 30 Hz and then decreased with small peaks at 100 Hz and 300 Hz. Our results suggest that cotton work gloves do not show enough vibration-isolating performance.

40|$|Anyone {{seeking to}} control the risks from {{vibration}} transmitted to the hands and arms may contemplate the use of <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>gloves.</b> To make an informed decision about any type of personal protective equipment, {{it is necessary to}} have performance data that allow the degree of protection to be estimated. The information provided with an anti-vibration glove may not be easy to understand without some background knowledge of how gloves are tested and does not provide any clear route for estimating likely protection. Some of the factors that influence the potential efficacy of an anti-vibration glove include how risks from hand-arm vibration exposure are assessed, how the standard test for a glove is carried out, the frequency range and direction of the vibration for which protection is sought, how much hand contact force or pressure is applied and the physical limitations due to glove material and construction.

40|$|The {{extent to}} which a glove modifies the risks from hand-transmitted {{vibration}} is quantified in ISO 10819 : 1996 by a measure of glove transmissibility determined with one vibration magnitude, one contact force with a handle and only three subjects. This study was designed to investigate systematically the vibration transmissibility of four ‘anti-vibration’ gloves over the frequency range 16 – 1600 Hz with 12 subjects, at six magnitudes of vibration (0. 25 – 8. 0 ms? 2 r. m. s.) and with six push forces (5 N to 80 N). The four gloves showed different transmissibility characteristics that were not greatly affected by vibration magnitude but highly dependent on push force. In all conditions, the variability in transmissibility between subjects was as great as the variability between gloves. It is concluded that a standardised test of glove dynamic performance should include a wide range of hands and a range of forces representative of those occurring in work with vibratory tools. Statement of Relevance: The transmission of vibration through <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>gloves</b> is highly dependent on the push force between the hand and a handle and also highly dependent on the hand that is inside the glove.

This study involves {{the development of a new}} artificial model that approximates both loading and vibration behaviour of the human finger. The layered system uses polypropylene "bones", encased in a cylinder of low modulus, room-temperature curing silicone gel (to replicate subcutaneous tissues), with an outer layer of latex (to replicate the dermis and epidermis). A protocol for manufacture was developed and dynamic mechanical analysis was carried out on a range of gels in order to choose a range close to the mechanical properties of the human finger. The load-deflection behaviour under quasi-static loading was obtained using an indenter. The indentation measurements were then compared with a set of validation data obtained from human participant testing under the same conditions. A 2 -D FE model of the finger was also used to assess vibration responses using existing parameters for a human finger and those obtained from the tested materials. Vibration analysis was conducted under swept sinusoidal excitations ranging from 10 to 400 Hz whilst the FE finger model was pressed 6 mm toward the handle. Results were found to compare well. This synthetic test-bed and protocol can now be used in future experiments for assessing finger-transmitted vibrations.

40|$|Daily working {{activities}} and functions require a high contribution of hand and forearm muscles in executing grip force. To study {{the effects of}} wearing different gloves on grip strength, under a variety of hand skin temperatures, an assessment of the maximum grip strength was performed with 32 healthy male workers with a mean age (standard deviation) of 30. 44 (5. 35) years wearing five industrial gloves at three hand skin temperatures. Their ages and anthropometric characteristics including body mass index (BMI), hand length, hand width, hand depth, hand palm, and wrist circumference were measured. The hand was exposed to different bath temperatures (5 °C, 25 °C, and 45 °C) and hand grip strength was measured using a Jamar hydraulic hand dynamometer with and without wearing the gloves (chemical protection glove, rubber insulating <b>glove,</b> <b>anti-vibration</b> impact <b>glove,</b> cotton yarn knitted glove, and RY-WG 002 working glove). The data were analyzed using the Shapiro–Wilk test, Pearson correlation coefficient, Tukey test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the within-subject design analysis. The results showed that wearing gloves significantly affected the maximum grip strength. Wearing the RY-WG 002 working glove produced a greater reduction on the maximum grip when compared with the bare hand, while low temperatures (5 °C) had a significant influence on grip when compared to medium (25 °C) and high (45 °C) hand skin temperatures.

The primary aim of this work is {{to gain a better understanding}} of the effects of different aspects of exposure to finger transmitted vibration (FTV) related to operators using hand-held vibrating tools. To achieve this, firstly, a new method for measuring finger transmitted vibration was developed and assessed, including a tool vibration test rig and measurement protocol. The effect on FTV measurement of using a small accelerometer attached to the back of the finger was investigated using 2 D finite element modelling. Comparisons were also made using a laser vibrometer. Analysis showed that the new test rig is capable of measuring FTV at frequencies ranging from 10 to 400 Hz, under different grip force levels, and that adding a small accelerometer mass (0. 3 grams) did not significantly affect measurements. A human participant study then carried out using the new rig. Various characteristic measurements were collected in tandem, including anthropometry, skin characterisation and behaviour under loading to investigate the effect of different factors on FTV. The results showed that FTV varied among individuals and the key finding was that exposure to vibration has a significant effect on finger temperature even for a short period of testing. <b>Anti-vibration</b> (AV) <b>glove</b> materials were investigated using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and tested using human participants. The results showed that the mechanical properties of AV materials change under real world industrial conditions such as excitation frequencies and temperature. Finally, a new artificial test-bed was developed to replicate the transmitted vibration of the index finger. Studies were conducted on a range of 5 test-beds, to allow comparison with the human measurements, including indentation, vibration transmissibility and FE modelling. FE modelling showed that the distribution of dynamic strain was found to be highest in the vasculature region of the finger, indicating that this could be one of the contributing factors of VWF. One of the finger test-bed was selected as best replicating the mechanical properties of the real finger. The artificial test-bed provided better consistency than human participants, for testing parameters, such as grip force, and can be used in future for testing AV gloves with no need for human subjects. ii Further investigations are suggested to be made to enhance the limitations of this project, including material analysis, testing protocol and finite element modelling.

Two different vibration tools were used in a simulated work environment: (1) A compact Duty Multi-Cutter Bosch and (2) and a Percussion Drill with a drill bit Ø 20 mm. Standard operations were performed by each subject in the following materials: (1) Performing cross-sectional cuts in 80 x 40 mm pine section and (2) performing 20 mm diameter holes in a concrete slab 2 x 2 m, 70 mm thick. The forearm contraction level were measured by surface electromyography in four different muscles: Flexor Digitorum Superficialis (FDS), Flexor Carpi Ulnaris (FCU), Extensor Carpi Radialis Longus (ECRL) e Extensor Carpi Ulnaris (ECU). For the flexor muscles (FDS, FCU), an increase tendency in muscular contraction was observed when the operations are performed without gloves (2 - 5 % MVE increase in the FDS and 3 - 9 % MVE increase in the FCU). For the extensor muscles ECU a decrease tendency in muscular contraction was observed when the operations are performed without gloves (1 - 10 % MVE decrease). Any tendency was found in the ECRL muscle. ECU was the muscle with the highest contraction level for 79 % and 71 % of the operators, during the operations respectively with the multi-cutter (P 50 = 27 - 30 %MVE) and with the percussion drill (P 50 = 46 - 55 %MVE).

40|$|Exposure to hand-transmitted {{vibration}} (HTV) {{arising from}} operating hand-held power tools {{has been associated}} with various health consequences such as vascular, neurological and musculoskeletal disorders of the hand-arm system, which are collectively termed as hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). In order to decrease the effects of HTV, substantial efforts have been made to protect the operator from the vibrating tools and decrease the vibration exposure. One of the convenient means to isolate the hand from the vibrating tool handle is the <b>anti-vibration</b> (AV) <b>glove.</b> These gloves are constructed from different isolation materials, which are capable of reducing the vibration transmitted to the hands. Vibration isolation performance of AV gloves has been widely evaluated based on measurements of vibration transmitted to the palm of the hand following the method recommended in ISO 10819 (2013). The standard does not require the measurement of transmitted vibration at the fingers side, and consider similar vibration isolation performance of the gloves at the palm and the fingers. The standard also does not address the effect of AV gloves on the hand grip strength, which can be a reason for not wearing these gloves by tool operators. This dissertation seeks to develop a finger adapter capable of measuring the transmitted vibration to fingers and assess the AV gloves based on the integrated performance of vibration isolation at palm and fingers as well as the grip strength preservation. Three different finger adapters (a steel ring, a split ring and a Velcro adapter), each instrumented with a tri-axial accelerometer, were developed and assessed to measure the vibration transmitted to the index and the middle fingers. The assessment of the three adapters showed that the Velcro adapter exhibit relatively lower inter-subject variability and yields resonably good agreements with the data reported in a recent study that measured fingers vibration using laser vibrometer. The effectiveness of the Velcro finger adapters was further explored through their ability of generating repeatable and reproducible vibration measurements. Good repeatability was observed from the vibration transmissibility measured during three trials perfromed with bare hand fingers. In the reproducibility tests, the subjects were asked to remove and reinstall the finger adapters between the trials. The assessment results showed that the obtained vibration transmissibility measurements were reproducible within each subject. In order to enhance the understanding of fingers vibration, an investigation was conducted through measurements of vibration transmissibility of four different vibration reducing (VR) gloves at the middle phalanges of index and middle fingers using two Velcro finger adapters. Four male subjects participated in the measurements, which were conducted under the standardized vibration spectrum and the spectra of three different hand tools. Vibration transmissibility of the gloves were also measured at the palm using the standardized palm adapter. The frequency response functions (FRFs) of gloves at the index and middle fingers were utilized to estimate the vibration transmissibility of the gloves under different tool spectra. Only two gloves would be considered as AV gloves, although these showed fingers vibration amplification. The FRF method of estimating fingers vibration responses resulted in reliable prediction of the perfromance for different tools. Furthermore, 12 male subjects participated for assessment of integrated performance of 12 different VR gloves in terms of vibration transmission performance at the palm and fingers, as well as the effect of gloves on the grip strength preservation. The grip strength magnitude was measured using the cylindrical handle utilized in the vibration transmissibility measurements. The overall vibration transmissibility of the gloves at the fingers were obtained using the frequency weighting recommended in the standard and the reported fingers weighting. All the gloves attenuated fingers vibration in the 10 – 200 Hz frequency range, with exception of only two gloves. At greater frequencies (> 200 Hz), majority of the gloves amplified the middle finger transmitted vibration, while only a few gloves showed vibration amplification at the index finger. The effect of different frequency weightings on the vibration isolation performance of gloves at the fingers was only evident in the high frequency range (200 – 1250 Hz). Only four gloves passed the standardized screening criteria despite their vibration amplification at the fingers. All the gloves resulted in reduced hand grip strength with only one exception...|$|R

40|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to vibration {{transmitted to the}} operators of hand-held power tools has been related to symptoms of vibration white finger (VWF) disease, also known as "Raynaud's Phenomenon of Occupational Origin". Many subjective and objective epidemiological, and clinical studies have established the prevalence rates and vibration related symptoms, such as VWF disease, loss of muscle strength, injuries to bones and joints, and disorders of the central nervous system. The mechanism leading to these disorders, however, remains almost unknown. The biodynamic response characteristics of the hand-arm system, subject to handle vibration are investigated through: (i) measurement and synthesis of driving point mechanical impedance; (ii) study of hand-grip pressure distribution to gain an insight to a probable mechanism leading to VWF disease; (iii) study of electromyography of finger flexor muscles to enhance {{an understanding of the}} vibration induced loss of muscle and grip strength; and (iv) study of vibration transmissibility of the hand-arm system and the protection offered by so-called "anti-vibration" gloves. The biodynamic response of the hand-arm system is investigated for sinusoidal as well as stochastic excitations in the three orthogonal directions of vibration. Linear and nonlinear analytical models with constant and grip force dependent parameters are developed to characterize the dynamic response of the hand-arm system. A comparison of the model response to the measured data revealed that the nonlinear analytical models with grip force dependent parameters can accurately predict the hand-arm vibration response for different hand-grip forces over a wide frequency range of tool vibration. Further, the measured data reported in the literature are synthesized to propose a range of idealized values of driving point impedance in all the three directions of vibration. The hand response to impinged and transmitted vibration is investigated through measurement and analysis of distribution of dynamic forces at the hand-handle interface, and electrical activity of the finger flexor muscles. A sensing grid comprising of flexible pressure sensors was fabricated to measure the interface pressure under static and dynamic conditions. The pressure distribution is related to impaired blood flow, and thus to the probable mechanism leading to the onset of VWF disease. The primary injury mechanisms are further investigated using electromyography (EMG) of the finger flexor muscles, the muscle group responsible for exerting the grip force on the handle. Analysis of the results showed that EMG of muscle group under vibration is as high as 6 times the EMG measured under static grip condition. A methodology is proposed to measure the hand-transmitted vibration and to assess the performance of the <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>gloves.</b> Analytical models are developed to characterize the vibration transmissibility of the hand-arm and the protective gloves.

Exposure has been linked to Raynaud’s phenomenon, or vibration-induced white finger (VWF), and to neurological symptoms that ultimately affect the senses of touch and temperature. Muscular weakness and reduced hand grip strength are concerns not only as symptoms that detrimentally impact on the daily lives of those affected, but also for potentially increasing the risk of injury when performing heavy manual work with powerful hand-held tools or machines. These subjects have been addressed in a series of international conferences, the most recent of which, The Twelfth International Conference on Hand-Arm Vibration, was held in Ottawa in 2011. Short papers from this conference have been published in Canadian Acoustics 1). Workshops addressing key issues have become the hallmark of recent international conferences on hand-arm vibration.

Methods: Eight operators were recruited to operate the motorized forks during this laboratory study. Four fork configurations {{were used in}} the study; two motor speeds and two fork basket options were evaluated. Accelerations were measured near each hand as the operators completed the simulated beach-cleaning task. Results: The dominant vibration frequency for these tools was identified to be around 20 Hz.

These forks exhibited considerable acceleration magnitudes when unloaded. Conclusions: The study results suggest that the motor should not be operated with the fork in the unloaded state. <b>Anti-vibration</b> <b>gloves</b> are not effective at attenuating the vibration frequencies produced by these forks, and they may even amplify the transmitted vibration and increase hand/arm fatigue.

This paper presents a new conceptual model relating factors influencing cause-effect relationships for HTV exposure, a new study strategy, and a comprehensive review of the recent advances in the biodynamics closely associated with HTV exposure. The review covers the following five aspects: theoretical modeling of biodynamic responses, vibration transmissibility, driving-point biodynamic responses, evaluation of <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>gloves,</b> and applied forces. This review finds that some significant advances in each of these aspects have been achieved in the recent years. Several important issues and problems in the biodynamic measurement have been identified and resolved, which has significantly helped improve the reliability and accuracy of the experimental data. The results reported in recent years suggest that, from the point of view of biodynamics, the frequency weighting specified in ISO 5349 - 1 (2001) overestimates the low frequency effect but underestimates the high frequency effect on the fingers and hand. The major problems, issues, and topics for further studies are also outlined in this paper. It is anticipated that the further studies of the biodynamics of the system will eventually lead to establishment of a robust vibration exposure theory. Although this review focuses on the biodynamics of the hand-arm system, the fundamental concepts and some methodologies reviewed in this paper may also be applicable for the study of whole-body vibration exposure...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 While <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>gloves</b> are {{widespread}} {{as a form}} {{of reducing}} employee exposure to hand-arm vibration (HAV) there is concern about how effective they actually are in a real manufacturing environment with specific tools. Currently ISO 10819 is used to certify gloves as "anti-vibration"; however, the standard only tests a static position and force which may not accurately represent a gloves ability to reduce vibration exposure during specific tasks. The aims of this study are to examine 4 different types of gloves and see how effective they are at reducing vibration exposure in employees performing a specific workplace task. The first hypothesis tested {{is whether or not the}} gloves are different from the bare hand measurements. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in vibration exposure when a glove is used. The second hypothesis evaluated is whether a difference can be observed between the gloves themselves. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the gloves. To determine the validity these two hypotheses, vibration exposure during a sanding task will be examined. The third hypothesis tested is whether the subjects' perception of vibration reduction with the gloves matches the actual measured results. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between subject perception and the measured results. This was done with a questionnaire given to the subjects asking them to rate the perceived vibration and rank the gloves in order of most effective to least. A jitterbug-style orbital sander was mounted with a tri-axial accelerometer while the subject had another tri-axial accelerometer attached to the back of their hand and both were connected to the same data logger so that simultaneous measurements of both accelerometers could be taken. In a randomly assigned order the subject used each of the four gloves to take one minute samples from sanding both a vertical and a horizontal surface. The same was done for a barehanded measurement where the subject used no glove, also randomly assigned in the order. A ratio from the tool and hand samples was found for each glove to find the transmissibility factor. The gloved transmissibility factors were then compared to that subject's bare hand sample to find the corrected transmissibility of the glove. The results differed depending on which surface was used. On the horizontal surface there was not a significant difference between the gloves and the bare hand, but if the sample size would have been larger then there likely would have been. There was a significant difference between gloves; one of the gloves was found to amplify vibration exposure. On the vertical surface there was no difference between the gloves and the bare hand or between the gloves themselves. The subject rankings of the gloves did not closely resemble the actual results. According to this study, ISO 10819 may not accurately depict a glove's ability to mitigate vibration for specific tasks. The use of <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>gloves</b> may also be an ineffective way to try to reduce employee exposure to high levels of vibration...|$|E
40|$|<b>Anti-vibration</b> <b>gloves</b> {{have been}} used to block the {{transmission}} of vibration from powered hand tools to the user, and to protect users from the negative health consequences associated with exposure to vibration. However, there are conflicting reports as to the efficacy of gloves in protecting workers. The goal {{of this study was to}} use a characterized animal model of vibration-induced peripheral vascular and nerve injury to determine whether antivibration materials reduced or inhibited the effects of vibration on these physiological symptoms. Rats were exposed to 4 h of tail vibration at 125 Hz with an acceleration 49 m/s(2). The platform was either bare or covered with antivibrating glove material. Rats were tested for tactile sensitivity to applied pressure before and after vibration exposure. One day following the exposure, ventral tail arteries were assessed for sensitivity to vasodilating and vasoconstricting factors and nerves were examined histologically for early indicators of edema and inflammation. Ventral tail artery responses to an 12 C-adrenoreceptor agonist were enhanced in arteries from vibration-exposed rats compared to controls, regardless of whether antivibration materials were used or not. Rats exposed to vibration were also less sensitive to pressure after exposure. These findings are consistent with experimental findings in humans suggesting that antivibration gloves may not provide protection against the adverse health consequences of vibration exposure in all conditions. Additional studies need to be done examining newer antivibration materials. CC 999999 /Intramural CDC HHS/United States 2016 - 01 - 05 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 25965192 PMC 470082...|$|E
40|$|The {{transmission}} of vibration from tools, through work gloves {{and into the}} hands, is affected by many factors such as glove material properties, tool vibration conditions, temperature, and grip force. This study investigated how glove material properties affect tool vibration transmission into the index finger. Three samples of material (two taken from differently designed <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>gloves</b> and another for comparison that was designed for mounting vibration-sensitive equipment) were assessed using stepped sinusoidal vertical vibration excitations covering a range of a one-third octave band (from 20 to 400 Hz). Twelve human subjects {{were used for the}} testing. For all samples and subjects, measurements were obtained for: (I) dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) of the samples; (II) the transmissibility of vibration to the index finger at a grip force of 30 N, across the range of frequencies; and (III) transmissibility of vibration to the index finger at a frequency of 125 Hz for finger grip forces of 15, 30, and 45 N. No significant vibration attenuation was provided at frequencies below 150 Hz. The two materials taken from the gloves that passed the ISO 10819 : 1996 test showed resonance at frequencies of 150 and 160 Hz a, but the material that did not pass the ISO test showed resonance at 250 Hz. The attenuation for all three materials was occurred at 400 Hz. There was no significant change of transmissibility across the range of finger grip forces for any of the material samples. The level of transmissibility was found to vary between samples and subjects...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} are conducted to study the influence of mass unbalance, feed force {{and the presence of}} an autobalancer. The measured data are analyzed to derive the eight-hour energy equivalent vibration and the number of years of exposure that may cause vascular symptoms in 10 % of the worker's population. The results suggest that exposure to hand-transmitted vibration under 510 gm-mm mass unbalance at a speed of 7500 rpm could cause vibration-induced white finger among 10 % of the exposed population in approximately 2. 8 years. The addition of autobalancer, however, could reduce the eight-hour energy equivalent value to nearly 20 %. A preliminary attempt is made to derive a simplified model of coupled hand-grinder system. The model assumes rigid shaft-disc assembly, rigid tool body, linear bearing properties and the handles being attached rigidly to the tool body. A single-degree-of-freedom model of the hand and arm is also integrated along the y and z-axis of the basicentric axis system used in the study. The model results under varying degrees of mass-unbalance suggest that the magnitude of hand-transmitted vibration increases considerably with increasing mass-unbalance and angular speed. The results of the parametric study suggest that bearing damping does not influence the magnitude of transmitted vibration due to considerably higher natural frequency of the shaft-disc assembly. Increasing the damping properties of the hand-handle interface by introducing <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>gloves</b> or handle grips, however, could reduce the magnitude of transmitted vibration. From the results obtained from the analytical and experimental studies, it is concluded that the use of an automatic-balancer is vital to reduce the magnitudes of hand-transmitted vibration...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUNDFingers-transmitted {{vibration}} {{can cause}} vibration-induced white finger. The effectiveness of vibration-reducing (VR) gloves for reducing hand transmitted vibration to the fingers {{has not been}} sufficiently examined. OBJECTIVEThe objective {{of this study is}} to examine tool-specific performance of VR gloves for reducing finger-transmitted vibrations in three orthogonal directions (3 D) from powered hand tools. METHODSA transfer function method was used to estimate the tool-specific effectiveness of four typical VR gloves. The transfer functions of the VR glove fingers in three directions were either measured in this study or during a previous study using a 3 D laser vibrometer. More than seventy vibration spectra of various tools or machines were used in the estimations. RESULTSWhen assessed based on frequency-weighted acceleration, the gloves provided little vibration reduction. In some cases, the gloves amplified the vibration by more than 10 %, especially the neoprene glove. However, the neoprene glove did the best when the assessment was based on unweighted acceleration. The neoprene glove was able to reduce the vibration by 10 % or more of the unweighted vibration for 27 out of the 79 tools. If the dominant vibration of a tool handle or workpiece was in the shear direction relative to the fingers, as observed in the operation of needle scalers, hammer chisels, and bucking bars, the gloves did not reduce the vibration but increased it. CONCLUSIONSThis study confirmed that the effectiveness for reducing vibration varied with the gloves and the vibration reduction of each glove depended on tool, vibration direction to the fingers, and finger location. VR gloves, including certified <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>gloves</b> do not provide much vibration reduction when judged based on frequency-weighted acceleration. However, some of the VR gloves can provide more than 10 % reduction of the unweighted vibration for some tools or workpieces. Tools and gloves can be matched for better effectiveness for protecting the fingers. CC 999999 /Intramural CDC HHS/United States 2016 - 11 - 17 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 27867313 PMC 511302...|$|E
40|$|Exposure to hand-transmitted {{vibration}} (HTV) {{arising from}} hand power tools {{has long been}} associated with several disorders of the hand and arm, which are collectively termed as hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). Owing to high prevalence of HAVS among the operators of the power tools, particularly the percussive tools, the desire to develop low vibration tool designs, has been widely recognized. The design of vibration isolators or assessment of vibration performance of tools necessitates development of dynamic model of the tool coupled {{with that of the}} hand-arm system (HAS) to account for energy absorption within the HAS. This dissertation research is aimed at development of dynamic model of a percussive chipping hammer together with a biomechanical model of the hand-arm system. The model could serve as an essential tool for identifying effective vibration attenuation design features. The dynamic model of the tool is formulated considering identifications of various component contact pairs and the air flows between the primary piston and the striker. A tool tip-workpiece contact model is integrated to the tool model to describe the interactions between the tool and an energy dissipator. A biomechanical model of the hand-arm system is implemented to the tool model to develop a coupled hand-tool system, which could be applied to determine the hand vibration responses {{as a function of the}} push force. The properties of different impact pairs are identified from the theory of visco-elastic collision between rigid bodies. The validity of the hand-tool model is examined on the basis of available measured data under selected levels of the hand push force. A simple model of an anti-vibration glove is further introduced to study its effectiveness in limiting the vibration exposure. The simulation results show that the percussive tool model coupled with the biomechanical hand-arm model can yield reasonably good trends in view of the hand-transmitted vibration. The results suggest that the tool vibration transmitted to the hand is more sensitive to variations in push force and the operating speed. Slight increases in the diameter of the upper chamber orifices and the weight of the tool body, together with lower the striker mass, could yield notable reductions in the magnitudes of vibration transmitted to the hand-arm system. The results further show that the <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>gloves</b> yield very minimal vibration attenuation. ...|$|E
40|$|Are <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>gloves</b> the {{solution}} to the problem of hand-arm vibration?Vibrations from hand-held machinery are a major problem in the Swedish labour force. In 2009, 14 % of men and 3 % of women of employed in Sweden reported exposure to hand-arm vibration at least a quarter of their working time according to the Swedish Work Environment Authority (Arbetsmiljöverket 2010). It is tempting to imagine a protective glove that could reduce or even eliminate this problem. Research can validate the quality of labour protection gear available on the market and then make recommendations and suggestions for improvements. This report from the Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine in Lund and Gothenburg describes how <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>gloves</b> (AVGs) are experienced, and how they work and affect the exposure from hand-held machines. BackgroundToday, gloves labelled “anti-vibration” (AV) are advertised as “reducing vibration by 40 %”. To be marketed as “AVG”, a glove must be CE-certified and thereby comply with the requirements of International Organization for Standardization standard ISO 10819. The requirements apply only to the suppression of vibration in the palm of the hand, while in many work situations, vibration is transmitted to the fingers. However, in the ISO standard it is pointed out that AVGs provide inadequate damping of vibrations of low frequencies. Such vibrations are common in many hand-held tools and machines in industry and crafts, such as different types of grinders. Some regular protective gloves can even provide amplification of low frequencies but cannot be approved in accordance with this standard. Generally, all protective equipment disrupts work to a greater or lesser degree. Working without a helmet, protective mask, hearing protection and protective clothing is preferred in most situations. Furthermore, the availability of gloves which are supposedly AV may give rise to an ethical dilemma: the user may handle the machines more intensely and for a longer time in the belief that the hand is protected from vibration damage. But are those AV claims true and how do these gloves perform in practice? Is the experience regarding the gloves that they dampen the vibrations? To what extent do the gloves disturb the worker and interfere with the work? How much damping can be expected when using low-speed and high-speed grinders, respectively? These issues will be discussed in the following report. ImplementationNine subjects, whose work task was to deburr and grind aircraft engine components, were given the opportunity to test a specific AVG for 3 months. They all worked with a variety of rotating air-powered and vibrating machines. All had extensive experience in this work. Usage times for the individual machines varied between ½ hour and 4 hours/day. The total usage times sometimes exceeded 4 hours/day. The most commonly used rotating machines rotate at high speeds, 100 000 revolutions per minute (rpm), but other machines with low speed, 500 rpm, were also used. Only one model of AVG was tested. The back of the glove was made of porous polyester and the palm of a denser, elastic synthetic material. Approximately 7 mm thick, foam-like materials were built into the palm, thumb and fingers grip side of the glove. The glove was CE-marked and was claimed to comply with standard ISO 10819 : 1996. The test subjects tried the glove for 3 months. After this period they answered a questionnaire containing 14 questions including questions on hand temperature, grip, dexterity and self-reported vibration damping. To assess the usefulness of the AVG, the vibration level and vibration frequency spectrum were measured on the machines used by the subjects. During the measurements a skilled operator performed a typical deburring task. Results and DiscussionThe comfort in terms of hand temperature was rated mediocre. Grip was rated good while finger sensitivity was rated low. At a so-called “pencil grip”, required for handling small machinery, the gloves were uncomfortable; however, they worked well with larger machines. The majority, eight of the nine individuals, responded that the glove offered good vibration damping. As the hand’s ability to perceive vibrations varies with the frequency of vibration the possibility to self-assess whether a glove is vibration-damping or not largely depends on how well the person can perceive the frequency of the machine in question. With a high-revving machine of, say, 50 000 rpm, the vibration tactility is fairly low, and so is therefore the ability to self-assess the glove’s damping properties. In addition, the vibratory sense in the hand does not reflect the hand-arm weighted vibration level which needs to be measured according to the Swedish Work Environment Authority’s regulations (AFS 2005 : 15). With regard to the vibrations, large differences between the various machines were measured; hand-arm weighted levels according to the regulations were between 0. 8 and 8. 3 m/s 2. High-revving, ≥ 55 000 rpm, machines gave the lowest weighted vibration levels. A machine’s rotation speed was found to cause the dominant vibration frequency; however, high frequencies from high-speed machines do not increase the hand-arm weighted exposure levels. ConclusionThe vibrations from many of the machines in this study, which are used over long periods for deburring, will be damped to some extent. But it is not obvious that this damping neither can be experienced, nor give reduced daily vibration exposure in accordance with the regulations, or reduce the risk of vibration injury in the hands. So-called “AVGs” generally give insufficient reduction in vibration exposure. This is demonstrated already by the standard for CE certification of AVGs. For a glove to protect against normal, low-frequency vibrations, it would have to be too heavy and thick to be practical. Despite the limitations of the protection that the CE-marked protective gloves offer against vibrations, we still recommend the use of gloves because: 1) High-frequency vibrations, which are presumed to be harmful, will be damped. 2) The gloves will ensure that vibrations will not be amplified. 3) Gloves keep the hands warm, which is believed to reduce vibration-related disorders...|$|E
