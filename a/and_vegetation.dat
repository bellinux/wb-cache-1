5|$|During the Malayan Emergency (1948–1960), Britain was {{the first}} nation to employ the use of {{herbicides}} and defoliants to destroy bushes, trees, <b>and</b> <b>vegetation</b> to deprive insurgents of concealment and targeting food crops {{as part of a}} starvation campaign in the early 1950s. A detailed account of how the British experimented with the spraying of herbicides was written by two scientists, E.K.

5|$|During {{this period}} Van Gogh {{mastered}} {{the use of}} light by subjugating shadows and painting the trees {{as if they are}} the source of light – almost in a sacred manner. Early the following year he painted another smaller group of orchards, including View of Arles, Flowering Orchards. Van Gogh was enthralled by the landscape <b>and</b> <b>vegetation</b> of the south of France, and often visited the farm gardens near Arles. In the vivid light of the Mediterranean climate his palette significantly brightened.|$|E
5|$|Extant relations, {{such as the}} Bali myna (Leucopsar rothschildi) and the white-headed {{starling}} (Sturnia erythropygia), have similarities in colouration and other features with the extinct Mascarene species. Since the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings seem morphologically closer to each other than to the hoopoe starling—which appears closer to Southeast Asian starlings—there may have been two separate migrations of starlings from Asia to the Mascarenes, with the hoopoe starling the latest arrival. Except for Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the southwestern Indian Ocean with native starlings, probably due to their isolation, varied topography, <b>and</b> <b>vegetation.</b>|$|E
30|$|Global <b>vegetation</b> <b>and</b> climate {{are linked}} in both {{directions:}} when climate changes, so will <b>vegetation,</b> <b>and</b> when <b>vegetation</b> changes, {{so will the}} climate.

5|$|Freshwater {{resident}} {{rainbow trout}} usually inhabit and spawn in small to moderately large, well oxygenated, shallow rivers with gravel bottoms. They are {{native to the}} alluvial or freestone streams that are typical tributaries of the Pacific basin, but introduced rainbow trout have established wild, self-sustaining populations in other river types such as bedrock and spring creeks. Lake resident rainbow trout are usually found in moderately deep, cool lakes with adequate shallows <b>and</b> <b>vegetation</b> to support production of sufficient food sources. Lake populations generally require access to gravelly bottomed streams to be self-sustaining.|$|E
5|$|Gert {{was a large}} {{tropical}} cyclone {{for most of its}} lifespan; it always remained close enough to the coast to restrengthen and redevelop strong thunderstorms. In consequence, the storm produced heavy rainfall over a large area, causing extensive flooding and mudslides from Central America to Mexico. The disaster resulted in at least 116deaths and 16missing persons; damage to roads, property, crops <b>and</b> <b>vegetation</b> surmounted $170million.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds {{of species}} {{of animals and}} plants {{characterize}} the Santa Ana River's diversity of climates <b>and</b> <b>vegetation</b> zones. There are over ten of these vegetation zones in the watershed—including the sparsely vegetated alpine and subalpine zones in the mountains, mid-elevation forests of pine, lodgepole and oak, chaparral, coastal sage scrub, the increasingly rare riparian forest and marshes along the river bed, lined with trees and rushes, and the thinly vegetated coastal areas virtually flush with sea level. The watershed supports up to 200 bird species, fifty mammal species, 13 reptile species, 7 amphibian species, and 15 fish species, including steelhead trout.|$|E

5|$|It interbreeds {{regularly}} and extensively with the mallard, {{to which it}} is closely related. The female lays six to fourteen oval eggs, which have smooth shells and come in varied shades of white and buff green. Hatching takes 30 days on average. Incubation usually takes 25 to 26 days, with both sexes sharing duties, although the male usually defends the territory until the female reaches the middle of her incubation period. It takes about six weeks to fledge. Once the eggs hatch, the hen leads the brood to rearing areas with abundant invertebrates <b>and</b> <b>vegetation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nearly all Khmer Loeu are animist, {{and their}} cosmologies are {{intertwined}} with the natural world. Some forests {{are believed to be}} inhabited by local spirits, and local taboos forbid cutting in those areas. Within spirit forests, certain natural features such as rock formations, waterfalls, pools, <b>and</b> <b>vegetation</b> are sacred. Major sacrificial festivals in Ratanakiri occur during March and April, when fields are selected and prepared for the new planting season. Christian missionaries are present in the province, and some Khmer Loeu have converted to Christianity. The region's ethnic Khmer are Buddhist. There is also a small Muslim community, consisting mainly of ethnic Cham.|$|E
5|$|Terrestrial {{habitat types}} include forests, grasslands, {{wetlands}} and deserts. Within these broad biomes are more specific habitats with varying climate types, temperature regimes, soils, altitudes <b>and</b> <b>vegetation</b> types. Many of these habitats grade {{into each other}} and each one has its own typical communities of plants and animals. A habitat may suit a particular species well, but its presence or absence at any particular location depends to some extent on chance, on its dispersal abilities and its efficiency as a coloniser.|$|E

30|$|The {{results show}} a highly {{significant}} {{positive relationship between}} age <b>and</b> attitude/perception towards <b>vegetation</b> such as tress have rights as human beings which means that as age increases the attitude improves. It also reflects that as age increases, the sense that trees increase property value also improved. The table demonstrated that as age increases, the personal concerns towards vegetation decrease. A positive highly significant relationship was found between education <b>and</b> value of <b>vegetation.</b> It means that as education increases, the value of vegetation, such as trees decrease noise, provide shade, and protect from adverse environmental effects, increases. A highly significant inverse relationship was found among income, attitude towards <b>vegetation,</b> <b>and</b> knowledge of <b>vegetation</b> loss. It means that as income increases, the attitude towards <b>vegetation</b> <b>and</b> knowledge of <b>vegetation</b> decrease. The table also reflects that as income increases, the value of vegetation (it attracts more business and it improves quality of life) also increases. The table also shows a positive highly significant relationship between attitudes towards <b>vegetation</b> <b>and</b> value of <b>vegetation.</b> It means that as positive perception towards vegetation improves, the value of vegetation also enhances. A highly significant positive relationship is found between the role of <b>vegetation</b> <b>and</b> value of <b>vegetation</b> (it provides shade and cool, reduces noise, and improves quality of life). A negative correlation is found between the role of <b>vegetation</b> <b>and</b> the belief that it protects from adverse environmental effects.|$|R
5|$|The Algodones Dunes {{were formed}} from sand {{deposited}} by Lake Cahuilla, which was transported by wind toward the area. During its existence, the lake supported a rich biota with fish, bivalves <b>and</b> <b>vegetation</b> on its shorelines. These resources supported human populations on its shores, {{as evidenced by}} a number of archeological sites and mythological references to the lake in the traditions of the Cahuilla. The lake may have had profound effects on population genetics and language history of the surrounding regions.|$|E
5|$|The Cascade Range is {{dramatically}} different in climate from west to east. The west side is heavily forested and features trees such as Douglas firs, western hemlock, Pacific silver firs, and Alaska yellow cedars. East of the Cascades, where Yamsay lies, the climate becomes much drier, even arid. Precipitation significantly declines <b>and</b> <b>vegetation</b> becomes more sparse, with lodgepole pine, white fir, ponderosa pine, and juniper.

5|$|The {{possibility}} that the Hawaiian islands became older as one moved to the northwest was suspected by ancient Hawaiians long before Europeans arrived. During their voyages, seafaring Hawaiians noticed differences in erosion, soil formation, <b>and</b> <b>vegetation,</b> allowing them to deduce that the islands to the northwest (Niihau and Kauai) were older than those to the southeast (Maui and Hawaii). The idea was handed down the generations through the legend of Pele, the fiery Hawaiian Goddess of Volcanoes.|$|E

5|$|Vehicle {{camouflage}} techniques {{begin with}} paint, which offers at best only limited effectiveness. Other methods for stationary land vehicles include covering with improvised {{materials such as}} blankets <b>and</b> <b>vegetation,</b> and erecting nets, screens and soft covers which may suitably reflect, scatter or absorb near infrared and radar waves. Some military textiles and vehicle camouflage paints also reflect infrared to help provide concealment from night vision devices.|$|E
40|$|Migrant {{bird species}} {{stopping}} over in urban locations {{are threatened by}} a number of anthropogenic causes of mortality, including collisions into reflective glass windows. Annual avian mortality rate, surrounding landscaping, and building characteristics that can potentially predict mortality rate were evaluated on mid-rises on the York University Keele Campus. I predicted that frequency of collisions increases with (1) higher proportional <b>vegetation</b> <b>and</b> proximity of <b>vegetation</b> to buildings, <b>and</b> (2) increased window area. After accounting for surveyor bias and predator removal, the rate of collision was 7. 7 4 SD birds/building/year. A negative binomial GLM determined collision frequency to be significantly predicted by proportional vegetation area, distance to <b>vegetation,</b> window area <b>and</b> wall <b>vegetation.</b> Significant interactions occurred between proportional <b>vegetation</b> area <b>and</b> season, distance to <b>vegetation</b> <b>and</b> window type, <b>and</b> wall <b>vegetation</b> <b>and</b> window area. It is strongly recommended that mitigation measures be implemented on high mortality buildings through visual markers...|$|R
