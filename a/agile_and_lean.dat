50|$|Agile retail is a direct-to-consumer retail {{model that}} uses big data {{to try to}} predict trends, manage {{efficient}} production cycles, and faster turnaround on emerging styles. Agile retail applies concepts from <b>Agile</b> <b>and</b> <b>Lean</b> in the retail business, and aims to respond faster to customer needs. This retail model is used by Amazon.

5000|$|Supply {{chains are}} central to the {{creation}} of fast fashion. Supply chain systems are designed to add value and reduce cost in the process of moving goods from design concept to retail stores and finally through to consumption. Efficient supply chains are critical to delivering the retail customer promise of fast fashion. The selection of a merchandising vendor is a key part in the process. Inefficiency primarily occurs when suppliers can't respond quickly enough, and clothing ends up bottlenecked and in back stock. [...] Two kinds of supply chains exist, <b>agile</b> <b>and</b> <b>lean.</b> In an agile supply chain the principal characteristics include the sharing of information and technology. [...] The collaboration results in the reduction in the amount of stock in the megastores. A lean supply chain is characterized as the correct appropriation of the commodity for the product.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, {{research}} in the area of <b>agile</b> <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> software development has mirrored the strong growth of the use of <b>agile</b> <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> methodologies. However, while these research streams have made a significant contribution in the use of <b>agile</b> <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> methodologies, much of the recent research lacks the rigor and relevance to make an impact in research and practice. For example, many of the studies have not measured the actual use of agile or lean methods nor had a significant theoretical grounding. Furthermore, agile research has not expanded to fully cover emerging opportunities and challenges. A deeper theoretical motivation on <b>agile</b> <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> software development can help demonstrate how the principles of, for example, agile software development, may be transferred to these other areas, and hence, broaden the research’s relevance. This paper provides commentary intended to help push the <b>agile</b> <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> research agenda forward, and outlines three key critieria that future researchers should consider when conducting research on the phenomenon of agile.

40|$|Abstract: The new {{manufacturing}} paradigms, {{starting with}} <b>agile</b> manufacturing <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> production, are leading our society towards {{a new generation}} of concurrent enterprises involving virtual enterprise architecture and concurrent engineering methodology for e-Enterprise. A continuing adaptation to the global market needs can only be achieved efficiently if also the planning and control processes are optimized both horizontally (Automatic Control Systems) and vertically (Management Control System). Consistent improvement in performance and realization of (fast reactive) highly dynamic enterprise objectives requires a tight integration of the units of the enterprise. Taking into consideration that the entities of the eEnterprise are cooperating in order to achieve the global goal, a problem appears: how to cooperate not knowing the internal models of the entities who are cooperating? In order to obtain at some moment a real-time solution, a certain form of negotiation appears to be necessary. Contract agents can implement an automated negotiation mechanism. The mathematical background provided by game theory, then provides a decision support for the contract agents. It also allows to model the behavior of the agents in a negotiation...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} the specific stages of the humanitarian logistics process in which the <b>agile</b> <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> principles are needed. Design/methodology/approach – To achieve this purpose, the authors propose an original conceptual framework and apply it to evidence from a “best practice” case study in the humanitarian sector: the United Nations World Food Programme and its efforts in the Darfur (Sudan) crisis. Findings – Although several previous works introduced the agile principle as suitable for disaster relief, when and how to embrace the <b>agile</b> <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> principles remained unclear. This paper demonstrates the proper combination of the <b>agile</b> <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> principles in disaster relief phases. The correspondence is based on the coincidence of the objectives that arises in every stage and that each principle is capable of achieving. Research limitations/implications – Further empirical research is needed to support the framework and to enrich the results that arise from this first explorative work. Practical implications – The proposed framework is targeted at leading actors involved in the operation and planning of humanitarian logistics when a crisis emerges. This approach, which is based on the combination of the <b>agile</b> <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> principles, is not exclusive to the humanitarian sector. This perspective may be useful to create business logistics that address disruptions to traditional supply chain flows and other forces that disrupt logistics, production and information handling.

40|$|Different {{methods of}} company {{building}} exist, {{both traditional and}} non-traditional. The non-traditional method, the Lean Startup, combines iterative <b>Agile</b> development <b>and</b> <b>Lean</b> manufacturing, to an iterative build, measure and learn cycle, in order to enable building fast growth companies, i. e. startups. To support and guide trough the startup building process, several startup building programs (e. g. incubators, accelerators, and venture builders) evolved since the 2000 Internet bust. Monitoring and managing the risks in the startup building processes within these programs require Performance Measurement. Performance measurement has shifted the last decades from mainly Financial Accounting to a merely broader measurement of startups, referred to as Innovation Accounting. The traditional investing world can be shifted as well, by applying traditional success factors (similar to risk factors), which can be categorized on Team, Product and Market, and Startup, to a more non-traditional (Lean Startup) perspective on the startup lifecycle and its related success factors. Literature research and field research on startup building organizations and startup investors result in a framework providing insights and metrics on startup building and its performance measurement. Metrics can be divided on category into two types, General and Stage dependent. Metrics can be actionable or vanity metrics. The resulting SPIM Framework consisting of the Stakeholders, General and Stage dependent metrics, and a Framework Application Model, enables Startup Performance Information Management (SPIM) for the different stages and stakeholders in the startup lifecycle...|$|R
