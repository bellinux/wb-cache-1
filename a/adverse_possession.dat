25|$|Some jurisdictions merge {{the concept}} of <b>adverse</b> <b>possession</b> with that of prescription, so that <b>adverse</b> <b>possession</b> {{may be used to}} gain various incorporeal rights to land as well as land itself.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{elements}} of an <b>adverse</b> <b>possession</b> action are different in every jurisdiction, a person claiming <b>adverse</b> <b>possession</b> is usually required to prove non-permissive use of the property that is actual, open and notorious, exclusive, adverse, and continuous for the statutory period.|$|E
25|$|Strictly speaking, {{prescription}} {{works in}} a different way to <b>adverse</b> <b>possession.</b> <b>Adverse</b> <b>possession</b> is concerned with the extinction of the title of the original owner by a rule of limitation of actions. Prescription, on the other hand, is concerned with acquiring a right that did not previously exist.|$|E

25|$|The party seeking title by <b>adverse</b> <b>possession</b> may {{be called}} the disseisor, meaning one who dispossesses the true owner of the property. Although the {{elements}} of an <b>adverse</b> <b>possession</b> claim are different in each state, <b>adverse</b> <b>possession</b> requires at a minimum five basic conditions being met to perfect {{the title of the}} disseisor. These are that the disseisor must openly occupy the property exclusively, {{in a manner that is}} open and notorious, keep out others, and use it as if it were his own. Some states impose additional requirements.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adverse</b> <b>possession</b> {{does not}} {{typically}} work against property {{owned by the}} public.|$|E
25|$|The {{statute of}} {{limitations}} applies only to the disseisor's time on the property, not how long the true owner may have been dispossessed of it (by, say, another disseisor who then left the property). However, if <b>adverse</b> <b>possession</b> is continuous between two or more successive disseisors without interruption, {{it may be possible}} for the second disseisor to claim <b>adverse</b> <b>possession</b> for the entire period based upon a legal doctrine known as tacking.|$|E

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2016. Includes bibliographical references. The February 19, 1900, General Order No. 540 of the United States Naval Department {{was enacted}} vis-à-vis Executive Order No. 125 -A, thus placing the ‘Sāmoan 1 Group’ {{under the control}} of the Naval Department. The Naval Department had supreme legislative, executive, and {{judicial}} power over the Sāmoan Group with the intention of expanding the United States Naval Station in the Pago Pago harbor of Tutuila. The Naval Administration instituted American real estate laws alongside traditional Sāmoan land tenure laws in American Sāmoa. 4 One of the significant real estate laws introduced was <b>adverse</b> land <b>possession.</b> This land ownership right was determined to be a milestone of enlightened western jurisprudence for land issues where Sāmoan customary laws were deemed insufficient and without merit. The evolution of <b>adverse</b> land <b>possession</b> principles in American Sāmoa has worked to erode the traditional communal land tenure system and fa’asāmoa culture by laying the groundwork for individually owned land rights. This type of land classification is incongruent with the Sāmoan communal land tenure system. This dissertation will examine the early Naval Court decisions and the incorporation of <b>adverse</b> land <b>possession</b> rights that has evolved into the individually owned land classification in American Sāmoa. The system of classifying land as individually owned takes away precious land holdings from communal tenureship, which is not regulated or monitored by the American Sāmoa Territorial Registrar. Since the Naval Court decisions more and more lands have become individually owned, a trend that has damaged the communal land holding system and the fa’asāmoa culture. Preserving what remains of traditional land tenure cannot be achieved without examining the political and legal relationships between American Sāmoa and the U. S. This dissertation will analyze these relationships to recommend practical alternatives to shelter Sāmoan cultural institutions within the American body-politic...|$|R
25|$|Good faith view – a {{few states}} require that the party {{claiming}} <b>adverse</b> <b>possession</b> must have mistakenly believed that it is his land.|$|E
25|$|Some jurisdictions permit {{accidental}} <b>adverse</b> <b>possession,</b> {{as might}} occur {{as the result}} of a surveying error that places the boundary line between properties in the wrong location.|$|E
25|$|Some non-common law jurisdictions {{have laws}} similar to <b>adverse</b> <b>possession.</b> For example, Louisiana has a legal {{doctrine}} called acquisitive prescription, which {{is derived from}} French law.|$|E
25|$|The {{disseisor}} claiming <b>adverse</b> <b>possession</b> {{must hold}} that property continuously {{for the entire}} statute of limitations period, {{and use it as}} a true owner would for that time.|$|E
25|$|The legal {{principle}} of homesteading, then, is a formalization of the homestead principle {{in the same}} way that the right of <b>adverse</b> <b>possession</b> is a formalization of the pre-existing {{principle of}} squatter's rights.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} <b>adverse</b> <b>possession</b> {{would require a}} {{thorough}} analysis if private property is taken by eminent domain, after which control is given to a private corporation (such as a railroad), and then abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Some legal {{scholars}} have proposed {{the extension of}} the concept of <b>adverse</b> <b>possession</b> to intellectual property law, in particular to reconcile intellectual property and antitrust law or to unify copyright law and property law.|$|E
25|$|Since September 2012, {{squatting}} in {{a residential}} building is a criminal offence, {{but this does not}} prevent title being claimed by reason of <b>adverse</b> <b>possession</b> even if the claimant is committing a criminal offence.|$|E
25|$|In {{the law of}} England and Wales <b>adverse</b> <b>possession</b> and {{prescription}} are treated as being entirely different doctrines. The former being entirely statutory deriving from the Limitation Act 1980, the latter being possible under purely common law principles.|$|E
25|$|Easements by prescription, {{also called}} {{prescriptive}} easements, are implied easements granted after the dominant estate {{has used the}} property in a hostile, continuous and open manner for a statutorily prescribed number of years. Prescriptive easements differ from <b>adverse</b> <b>possession</b> by not requiring exclusivity.|$|E
25|$|Chattel {{property}} {{may also}} be adversely possessed, but owing to {{the differences in the}} nature of real and chattel property, the rules governing such claims are rather more stringent, favoring the legal owner rather than the adverse possessor. Claims for <b>adverse</b> <b>possession</b> of chattel often involve works of art.|$|E
25|$|Dispossession of land {{owned by}} a {{governmental}} entity: Generally, a disseisor cannot dispossess land legally {{owned by a}} government entity even if all other elements of <b>adverse</b> <b>possession</b> are met. One exception is when the government entity is acting like a business rather than a government entity.|$|E
25|$|Where land is {{registered}} under a Torrens {{title registration}} system or similar, special rules apply. It {{may be that}} the land cannot be affected by <b>adverse</b> <b>possession</b> (as was the case in England and Wales from 1875 to 1926, and as is still the case in the state of Minnesota) or that special rules apply.|$|E
25|$|Supporters of the {{greenway}} {{claim that}} use of a greenway will protect the trackbed from <b>adverse</b> <b>possession</b> claims and will not preclude reinstatement of the disused sections of line as a working railway in the future. However, the recent case of the Comber railway in Belfast shows that once a rail line is converted into a walking or cycling path it is practically impossible to get it back.|$|E
25|$|The {{period of}} {{continuous}} {{use for a}} prescriptive easement to become binding is generally between 5 and 30 years depending upon local laws (sometimes based on {{the statute of limitations}} on trespass). Generally, if the true property owner acts appropriately to defend their property rights {{at any time during the}} required time period the hostile use will end, claims on <b>adverse</b> <b>possession</b> rights are voided, and the continuous use time period will be reset to zero.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adverse</b> <b>possession</b> {{may also}} apply to {{territorial}} rights. In the United States, Georgia lost {{an island in the}} Savannah River to South Carolina in 1990, when South Carolina had used fill from dredging to attach the island to its own shore. Since Georgia knew of this yet did nothing about it, the U.S. Supreme Court (which has original jurisdiction in such matters) granted this land to South Carolina, although the Treaty of Beaufort (1787) explicitly specified that the river's islands belonged to Georgia.|$|E
25|$|For {{registered}} land, <b>adverse</b> <b>possession</b> claims completed before 13 October 2003 (the {{date the}} 2002 Act came into force) {{are governed by}} section 75(1) and 75(2) of the Land Registration Act of 1925. The limitation period remains the same (12 years) but instead of the original owner's title to the land being extinguished, the original owner holds the land on trust for the adverse possessor. The adverse possessor can then apply {{to be the new}} registered proprietor of the land.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adverse</b> <b>possession</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{contentious}} methods of acquiring property, albeit one that has played a huge role in the history of English land. Historically, if someone possessed land for long enough, it was thought that this in itself justified acquisition of a good title. This meant that while English land was continually conquered, pillaged, and stolen by various factions, lords or barons throughout the middle ages, those who could show they possessed land long enough would not have their title questioned.|$|E
25|$|A {{disseisor}} will be {{committing a}} civil trespass {{on the property}} he has taken {{and the owner of}} the property could cause him to be evicted by an action in trespass ("ejectment") or by bringing an action for possession. All common law jurisdictions require that an ejectment action be brought within a specified time, after which the true owner is assumed to have acquiesced. The effect of a failure by the true landowner to evict the adverse possessor depends on the jurisdiction, but will eventually result in title by <b>adverse</b> <b>possession.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Roman law, {{usucapio}} laws allowed {{someone who}} was {{in possession of a}} good without title to become the lawful proprietor if the original owner didn't show up after some time (one or two years), unless the good was obtained illegally (by theft or force). Stemming from Roman law and its successor, the Napoleonic Code, adopted as the basis of law in France, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, and also, in part, by the Netherlands and Germany, <b>adverse</b> <b>possession</b> generally recognizes two time periods for the acquisition of property: 30 years and some lesser time period, depending on the bona fides of the possessor and the location of the parties involved.|$|E
25|$|On 6 June 2015, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi {{ratified}} the agreement {{during his visit}} to the Bangladesh capital Dhaka. In the presence of Modi and Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the foreign secretaries of the two countries signed the instruments of the land exchange. The physical exchange of enclaves and land parcels in <b>adverse</b> <b>possession,</b> and the boundary demarcation, will be implemented in phases between 31 July 2015 and 30 June 2016. The enclaves were to be exchanged at midnight on 31 July 2015 and the boundary demarcation is to be completed by 30 June 2016 by Survey Departments of the respective countries. The transfer of enclave residents is expected to be completed by 30 November 2015.|$|E
25|$|Generally, the disseisor's openly hostile {{possession}} must be continual (although not necessarily constant) without challenge or {{permission from the}} lawful owner, but breaks in use {{that are consistent with}} how an owner would use the property will not prevent an <b>adverse</b> <b>possession</b> claim. Occasional activity on the land with long gaps in activity fail the test of continuous possession; courts have ruled that merely cutting timber at intervals, when not accompanied by other actions that demonstrate actual and continuous possession, fails to demonstrate continuous possession. If {{at any time during the}} statute of limitations period, the true owner ejects the disseisor from the land either verbally or through legal action, and the disseisor then returns and dispossesses him again, then the statute of limitations period begins anew.|$|E

500|$|... "Gold Hill" [...] was {{the first}} Indian {{reservation}} in the colony, established in 1659 and confirmed in 1678. [...] Indians were also explicitly permitted to use public lands for hunting. [...] In other instances, the colony resolved land disputes between competing Indians. [...] Other reservations were established for the Mohegans in New London in 1718 and others in 1726 (which were exempted from the application of <b>adverse</b> <b>possession),</b> including the Pequot's before 1731.|$|E
500|$|Again on remand, the District Court denied certification, {{arguing that}} [...] each land-owner's defense of <b>adverse</b> <b>possession</b> would require {{individual}} factual determinations. [...] Because Judge Wilson again refused to certify {{the question for}} appeal, the Catawba again sought mandamus, which the Fourth Circuit (en banc) denied. On the mandamus appeal, the Fourth Circuit declined {{to resolve the issue}} of whether the statute of limitations was tolled against the non-named defendant class members.|$|E
