5|$|A chapel {{dedicated}} to St Catherine of Alexandria {{is known to}} have existed on the site since 1157, when the Prior of Durham agreed to allow Romanus de Hilton to appoint his own chaplain for the chapel, subject to the prior's approval. In return, de Hilton was to provide an <b>annual</b> <b>contribution</b> of 24sheaves of oats for every draught ox he owned, to the nearby monastery at Monkwearmouth, and was required to attend the mother church of St Peters for the feasts of the Nativity, Easter, Whitsuntide and Saints Peter and Paul. In 1322, there was a chantry {{dedicated to}} the Virgin Mary and there were three chantry priests in 1370.|$|E
5|$|In 1172, the new pope, Alexander III, further {{encouraged}} Henry {{to advance}} {{the integration of the}} Irish Church with Rome. Henry was authorised to impose a tithe of one penny per hearth as an <b>annual</b> <b>contribution.</b> This church levy, called Peter's Pence, is extant in Ireland as a voluntary donation. In turn, Henry accepted the title of Lord of Ireland which Henry conferred on his younger son, John Lackland, in 1185. This defined the Irish state as the Lordship of Ireland. When Henry's successor died unexpectedly in 1199, John inherited the crown of England and retained the Lordship of Ireland.|$|E

25|$|The Athenians {{defeated}} them by sea, and, after a siege {{that lasted}} more than two years, took the capital, Thasos, probably in 463 BC, and compelled the Thasians to destroy their walls, surrender their ships, pay an indemnity and an <b>annual</b> <b>contribution</b> (in 449 BC this was 21 talents, from 445 BC about 30 talents), and resign their possessions on the mainland. In 411 BC, {{at the time of}} the oligarchical revolution at Athens, Thasos again revolted from Athens and received a Lacedaemonian governor; but in 407 BC the partisans of Lacedaemon were expelled, and the Athenians under Thrasybulus were admitted.|$|E

25|$|The {{financial}} standing of the Drainage District had steadily improved since the 1807 Act, {{and they were}} repaying the money borrowed in earlier years. A Fifth Burnt Fen Act was obtained in 1823, which recognised {{the damage done to}} river banks by horses and commercial traffic using them, and made provision for such use to be charged. The burden of repair costs to river banks was further lightened by an <b>annual</b> <b>contribution</b> from the Bedford Level Corporation, and also from the Turnpike Commissioners, who had built a road close to the course of the River Great Ouse on the north western edge of the Fen, although this latter sum proved difficult to obtain at times.|$|E
25|$|Until 1831 {{the bridge}} was aligned with Fish Street Hill, so the main {{entrance}} into the City from the south passed the West door of St Magnus on the north bank of the river. The bridge included a chapel dedicated to St Thomas Becket {{for the use of}} pilgrims journeying to Canterbury Cathedral to visit his tomb. The chapel and about two thirds of the bridge were in the parish of St Magnus. After some years of rivalry a dispute arose between the church and the chapel over the offerings given to the chapel by the pilgrims. The matter was resolved by the brethren of the chapel making an <b>annual</b> <b>contribution</b> to St Magnus. At the Reformation the chapel was turned into a house and later a warehouse, the latter being demolished in 1757–58.|$|E
25|$|Even {{after the}} {{approval}} of the property tax, the college's funds remained inadequate to allow it to operate and expand. As president, Patterson gained a reputation as unduly frugal, particularly with regard to faculty salaries and facilities expansion. He personally lobbied the federal congress to pass the Hatch Act of 1887, which allowed land-grant colleges to receive federal land grants to construct agricultural experiment stations, and the Morrill Act of 1890, which provided for further endowment of land-grant colleges by the federal government. In 1900, he secured funding from the General Assembly {{for the construction of a}} gymnasium and a hall for female students, and in 1904, the General Assembly increased its <b>annual</b> <b>contribution</b> to the college's endowment by $15,000. When all other fundraising methods had been exhausted, Patterson resorted to securing a personal loan to cover the college's operating expenses.|$|E

25|$|South Bend's three {{airlines}} have non-stop flights to nine cities. Allegiant operates their Airbus A320 family to Las Vegas, Phoenix-Mesa, Orlando/Sanford, Punta Gorda/Fort Myers, and Tampa/St. Petersburg, United operates CRJ200s and ERJ-145s to Chicago O'Hare and Newark via their regional partners SkyWest and Expressjet, and Delta operates CRJ200 service to Atlanta, Detroit and Minneapolis through regional partner SkyWest. Due to the airports {{close proximity to}} Notre Dame, Delta operates seasonal mainline flights during graduation and home football games to Atlanta, Detroit, Minneapolis, as well as New York LaGuardia with their Airbus A320s, Boeing 717s, or McDonnell Douglas MD80 series aircraft. Additionally, Delta provides charter operations to the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team using Boeing 757, Boeing 767, or Airbus A330 series aircraft. The multi-modal terminal serves over one million air, rail and bus passengers each year. According to the 2007 Economic Impact Report from the Aviation Authority of Indiana, the airport's annual economic impact on South Bend and surrounding communities was in excess of $433.7 million. SBN’s <b>annual</b> <b>contribution</b> to the Indiana economy is estimated at more than $1.4 billion.|$|E
25|$|Despite his age, he was {{actively}} involved in Georgia’s political life. Backed by his tutor and an influential churchman George of Chqondidi, David IV pursued a purposeful policy, taking no unconsidered step. He was determined to bring order to the land, bridle the unsubmissive secular and ecclesiastic feudal lords, centralize the state administration, form {{a new type of}} army that would stand up better to the Seljuk Turkish military organization, and then go over to a methodical offensive with the aim of expelling the Seljuks first from Georgia and then from the whole Caucasus. Between 1089–1100, King David organized small detachments of his loyal troops to restore order and destroy isolated enemy troops. David also supported the establishment and gradual expansion of a well-organized and highly effective spy network, called mstovaris. He began the resettlement of devastated regions and helped to revive major cities. Encouraged by his success, but more importantly the beginning of the Crusades in Palestine, he ceased payment of the <b>annual</b> <b>contribution</b> to the Seljuks {{and put an end to}} their seasonal migration to Georgia. In 1101, King David captured the fortress of Zedazeni, a strategic point in his struggle for Kakheti and Hereti, and within the next three years he liberated most of eastern Georgia.|$|E

500|$|Boyce {{clashed with}} James E. West, the BSA's Chief Scout Executive, over {{a program for}} boys who lived too far from town to join a troop. Boyce offered to publish a {{magazine}} for the BSA, {{as long as it}} was published in Chicago. The National Executive Board of the BSA turned this offer down and shortly thereafter Boyce ceased being active in administrative activities of the BSA, though he remained a staunch supporter of the program. As a result of this and his desire to serve boys who had limited opportunities as he himself did when he was young, Boyce started a new Scouting-related venture: the Lone Scouts of America (LSA) on January 9, 1915. Reliance on Native American themes gave LSA a distinct Native American flavor: Lone Scouts could form small groups known as [...] "tribes", the tribe's treasurer was known as the [...] "wampum-bearer", and LSA taught boys to respect the environment. Boyce's <b>annual</b> <b>contribution</b> to the LSA grew to $100,000. In both the BSA and the LSA, Boyce was a manager and had little direct contact with the Boy Scouts. Upon his return from reporting on World War I, Boyce immediately began expanding the LSA by starting Lone Scout magazine and hiring Frank Allan Morgan, a noted Chicago Scoutmaster, to lead the LSA. By November 1915, the LSA had over 30,000 members. Warren conferred upon Boyce the title Chief Totem. Youths could join the LSA simply by mailing in some coupons and five cents. By 1916, the BSA and the LSA were in direct competition for members. In the summer of 1917, during his annual Dakota hunt, the Gros Ventres Indian tribe made Boyce an honorary chief with the name [...] "Big Cloud" [...] during a three-day ceremony. With America at war, Boyce agreed to the creation of a Lone Scout uniform in late 1917. Though he had a uniform made for himself, he stipulated that no Lone Scout was required to purchase one.|$|E
