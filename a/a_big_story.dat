500|$|As the Patriots {{tried to}} put {{themselves}} in position for a field goal, Arledge informed Frank Gifford and Howard Cosell of the shooting and suggested that they {{be the ones to}} report on the murder. Cosell, who had interviewed Lennon during a Monday Night Football broadcast in 1974, was chosen to do so but was apprehensive of it at first, as he felt the game should take precedence and that it was not their place to break such <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>story.</b> Gifford convinced Cosell otherwise, saying that he should not [...] "hang on to (the news)" [...] as the significance of the event was much greater than the finish of the game.|$|E
500|$|CBS senior {{journalist}} Danna Walker stated, [...] "There is {{criticism that}} it is only a story because she is a pretty blonde—and white—and it is criticism that journalists are taking to heart and looking elsewhere for other stories. But it is <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>story</b> because it is an American girl who went off on an adventure and didn't come back. It is a huge mystery, it is something people can identify with." [...] Good Morning America anchor Chris Cuomo was unapologetic of his program's extensive coverage of the Holloway case. [...] "I don't believe it's my role to judge what people want to watch… If they say, 'I {{want to know what happened}} to this girl'… I want to help them find out." ...|$|E
500|$|Peggy {{was written}} out of EastEnders in 2003, sent {{to live in}} Rio de Janeiro with her son Grant for two years, while Windsor took a sabbatical from the show after being {{diagnosed}} with the Epstein-Barr virus. Windsor had previously never taken {{more than two weeks}} leave annually during her eight years on the show, as Peggy was considered such a central character to the series. Windsor's absence was originally only supposed to be a year long. She stated at the time: [...] "This has been a very hard decision for me to make because I'm so happy here on EastEnders but it's been a long time without a proper break. I just feel some time off would be good for me and for the character too." [...] Louise Berridge, then EastEnders executive producer, commented: [...] "Barbara has been an absolute trouper for more than eight years on this show. We hope she has a great time and look forward to bringing her back with <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>story</b> in 2004." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1951, Douglas starred as a {{newspaper}} reporter anxiously looking for <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>story</b> in Ace in the Hole, director Billy Wilder's first effort as both writer and producer. The subject and story was controversial at the time, and U.S. audiences stayed away. Some reviews saw it as [...] "ruthless and cynical ... a distorted study of corruption, mob psychology and the free press." [...] Possibly it [...] "hit too close to home", says Douglas.|$|E
2500|$|Staines {{has been}} criticised for his {{approach}} to blogging. He often criticises the mainstream media, claiming that they are {{too close to the}} political establishment and that they also keep internal secrets about political scandals from the public. When allegations about John Prescott's private life appeared, Staines wrote that [...] "You can tell it is <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>story</b> because Nick Robinson is ignoring it". Robinson responded via his own blog, accusing Staines of having a political agenda to damage the government.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2006 he {{described}} the media as institutionally racist for its allegedly unbalanced coverage of crimes against white people, {{such as in the}} murder of Tom ap Rhys Pryce as compared to that given to crimes against those from ethnic minorities. As an example, he had referred to the murder of two young girls in Soham in 2002. He said [...] "almost nobody" [...] understood why it became such <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>story.</b> However, he was forced to issue an apology to the parents of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman.|$|E

2500|$|Writer Boal {{has stated}} his {{interest}} in making the original film on the 2001 Tora Bora hunt for bin Laden that he and Bigelow conceived.

2500|$|I {{had written}} long-form before {{but it is}} pure story-telling in script writing and that goes {{back as far as}} I can {{remember}} for me, not just with my father but with myself. I slept in the same bedroom as my sister for many years, until it became indecent to do so and I would tell her stories every night—that is how she would get to sleep. She would say [...] "tell me a story" [...] so I would tell her a story. So that ability, I very much had that from the start and I used to enjoy that at school so actually to write a script—it suddenly felt like I was just making up <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>story.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Days of Our Lives {{had been}} losing viewers in early 2000. The show managed to lure back James E. Reilly, {{who had left}} the show in 1997 to create his own soap opera, Passions.

Viewers were shocked to see long-term veteran Abe Carver (James Reynolds) shot at his front doorstep by a strange cloaked figure. Next, viewers saw Jack Deveraux (Matthew Ashford) attacked, and killed with a brick by the same cloaked figure that killed Abe. Next, viewers saw 34-year veteran recovering alcoholic Maggie Horton (Suzanne Rogers) get bludgeoned to death with a wine bottle. The next murder is when Caroline Brady (Peggy McCay) is poisoned.

She kills him at Tom Horton's grave after he finds out she is the killer. The most shocking murder occurs shortly after.Alice Horton (Frances Reid) finds a bloody note at her husband's grave with Marlena's name on it.
