5|$|According to cricket {{historian}} Bernard Whimpress, {{the early}} signs of a conspiracy against Marsh were raised by a journalist from The Age of Melbourne {{by the name of}} Old Boy. The journalist set a possible agenda by raising a question about Marsh to Crockett on the day before the bowler was called, possibly predisposing the umpire to take action. If Old Boy could be relied on, then observers suspected that Marsh's faster and slower ball were dubious. The reporter did not specify which ball he questioned, except to say that one ball per over was doubtful. The events in Australia occurred against <b>a</b> <b>backdrop</b> <b>of</b> a throwing frenzy in England. A fortnight earlier, the captains of the English county teams had drawn up a list of prohibited bowlers. In Australia, Jim Phillips had set the tone by no-balling Australian Test bowler Ernie Jones. The events in England were seen as a catalyst for a clean-up campaign against dubious bowling actions. Historians regarded Marsh as a prime target due to his Indigenous heritage and his supple wrist action.|$|E
5|$|In the {{intervening}} months, the Ministry of Transport had withdrawn permission for further stunts to be filmed on the M40, forcing the production team {{to resort to}} alternative methods to complete the Tiger Moth sequences. The special effects department constructed a -scale model re-creation, located on the Century 21 outdoor backlot to reduce lighting discrepancies, with radio-controlled miniatures of the Tiger Moth made to replace Hughes' aircraft. Ranging from six feet (1.8m) in width to a smaller -scale for filming with the puppet characters, the replicas were unreliable and frequently crashed, but Anderson asserts that the production team successfully merged the full-sized and miniature shots {{so that it is}} difficult to distinguish which aircraft is piloted by Hughes and which is remote-controlled. The scale reconstruction of the M40 bridge was aligned with <b>a</b> <b>backdrop</b> <b>of</b> real trees and fields to simulate the intended setting as faithfully as possible. Bad weather forced the outdoor filming to run for six weeks.|$|E

5|$|Nanako Kato, a {{spokesperson}} from Sony Computer Entertainment, addressed the matter from Tokyo. She {{pointed out that}} historical buildings are often used in entertainment, such as in iconic movie scenes involving Godzilla and the Tokyo Tower and King Kong in Manhattan. She acknowledged {{the church in the}} game holds a resemblance to Manchester Cathedral, but that the point was to depict <b>a</b> <b>backdrop</b> <b>of</b> an old church, not to illustrate a specific church. She added that Sony understands why the Church of England was offended especially because of its efforts to reduce the serious problem of gun violence in Manchester. She did not answer on whether Sony would donate money to the Cathedral's anti-gun program as the Church has demanded. At the time, over 2million copies of the game had been sold.|$|E
5|$|The Congress soon {{joined the}} new Indian ministry. The League was slower to do so, not {{entering}} until October 1946. In agreeing {{to have the}} League join the government, Jinnah abandoned his demands for parity with the Congress and a veto on matters concerning Muslims. The new ministry met amid <b>a</b> <b>backdrop</b> <b>of</b> rioting, especially in Calcutta. The Congress wanted the Viceroy to immediately summon the constituent assembly and begin the work of writing a constitution and felt that the League ministers should either join in the request or resign from the government. Wavell attempted to save the situation by flying leaders such as Jinnah, Liaquat, and Jawaharlal Nehru to London in December 1946. At {{the end of the}} talks, participants issued a statement that the constitution would not be forced on any unwilling parts of India. On the way back from London, Jinnah and Liaquat stopped in Cairo for several days of pan-Islamic meetings.|$|E

For the song's chorus, Dawn Richard and Kalenna Harper take the lead, ordering drinks in a bar and enjoying the night club. A fourth scene for T.I.'s verse sees the camera focus on T.I. serenading two women in an apartment. Throughout the video the images flicker between the various scenes. In the final part of the video, and during the bridge, all three members of the group appear outside against <b>a</b> <b>backdrop</b> <b>of</b> thick smoke and bright red fireworks. There is a final flash of fireworks before the camera fades completely, to black.|$|E

5|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} by Gaga in a similar choreography at the thirty-fifth season of NBC's late night comedy show Saturday Night Live. It was also present on the set list of Gaga's The Monster Ball Tour. She wore multiple donned braided extensions and was perched atop a railing. From each of her braids, a dancer was attached on the stage. <b>A</b> <b>backdrop</b> <b>of</b> stars were shown during the performance. During the revised shows of The Monster Ball, Gaga changed the concept {{and the performance of}} the song. She wore an emerald green dress by Thierry Mugler, and was attacked by a giant, mechanical Angler fish. Gaga then removed the dress to reveal a leotard of the same color and during the bridge she is lowered beneath the stage to acquire her pyro-technic bra. In the final chorus of the song Gaga returns and kills the monster with the sparks from the bra.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Usher {{sitting on a}} sofa with <b>a</b> <b>backdrop</b> <b>of</b> his girlfriend. When the verse starts, Usher goes to a wide glass window pane, looking at his girlfriend {{swimming}} in the pool. The surface is aflame after she is immersed in the water. In the next scene, Usher and his mistress are having sex. While {{sitting on the edge}} of the bed, Usher reminisces about the moments he and his girlfriend had have in the same bed. The bedsheets burn, the scene then cutting to Usher riding a silver right-hand drive Aston Martin DB5 with a British registration - EGF 158B (the car was featured in the TV series Fastlane). The video cuts with the backdrop also burning. Continuing to the car scene, Usher stops as he sees his imaginary girl again. He and dances, executing various hand routines. Video intercuts follow and the video ends with Usher standing. Right before the last chorus, the screen changes from a small screen to a full one with no framework.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{is almost}} {{six and a}} half minutes long. As the video begins, waves are seen {{crashing}} on a night time beach. Nearly a minute later, Beyoncé appears; she is strolling on a beach at night and she seemingly carries a massive trophy while an eerie music is playing in the background. Sporting a sheer negligee that reveals her bra and panties beneath, she twists her body in the sand. The singer also dances seductively against <b>a</b> <b>backdrop</b> <b>of</b> smoke and mouths the song's lyrics, staring at the camera. Beyoncé is later joined by husband Jay-Z, who is wearing a T-shirt and a backwards baseball cap. He raps with his eyes down holding a glass with alcohol in his hand while Beyoncé mouths the words behind him, smiling. The last seconds of the video show Beyoncé dancing and it concludes with close-up shots of the singer's face.|$|E

5|$|In 1926 Harold Knight {{spent several}} {{months at the}} Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, in America, {{painting}} portrait commissions of surgeons. Laura joined him there and was given permission to paint at the Baltimore Children's Hospital and in the black wards of the racially segregated Johns Hopkins Hospital. Whilst in Baltimore Knight painted a nurse, Pearl Johnson, who took her to meetings and concerts of the early American civil rights movement. Knight also hired a mother and child model to pose for the composition originally known as the Madonna of the Cotton Fields. Knight took these paintings back to London with her and they feature in the Pathé newsreel produced to mark her election as an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1927. Another portrait of Johnson, Irene and Pearl, shows two women against <b>a</b> <b>backdrop</b> <b>of</b> skyscrapers {{and was one of}} a number of portraits Knight painted in the late 1920s that appear strikingly modern. Miss Ealand, shown at the Royal Academy in 1928, depicts a woman with cropped hair wearing a jacket and holding a gun. The same year Knight's portrait of a women saxophone player was displayed at the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC.|$|E
