40|$|The {{association}} between the levels of various fatty acids in <b>adipose</b> <b>breast</b> <b>tissue</b> {{and the emergence of}} visceral metastases was prospectively studied in a cohort of 121 patients with an initially localised breast cancer. <b>Adipose</b> <b>breast</b> <b>tissue</b> was obtained at the time of initial surgery, and its fatty acid content analysed by capillary gas chromatography. A low level of alpha-linolenic acid (18 : 3 n- 3) in <b>adipose</b> <b>breast</b> <b>tissue</b> was associated with positive axillary lymph node status and with the presence of vascular invasion, but not with tumour size or mitotic index. After an average 31 months of follow-up, 21 patients developed metastases. Large tumour size, high mitotic index, presence of vascular invasion and low level of 18 : 3 n- 3 were single factors significantly associated with an increased risk of metastasis. A Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to identify prognostic factors. Low 18 : 3 n- 3 level and large tumour size were the two factors predictive of metastases. These results suggest that host alpha-linolenic acid has a specific role in the metastatic process in vivo. Further understanding of the biology of this essential fatty acid of the n- 3 series is needed in breast carcinoma...|$|E

The reference material for simulation of the breast attenuation proper-ties of glandular and <b>adipose</b> <b>breast</b> <b>tissues</b> is manufactured by a single provider. In order to characterize the attenuation properties of these materials, measurements in Hounsfield Units (HU) have been performed using a CT-scanner. Breast-equivalent plates have been imaged in different configurations (plates in and orthogonal to image planes), providing consistent results (+ 1. 3 HU). Breast density equivalent plates of different nominal breast density equivalences and sizes were measured, demonstrating both a good homogeneity within the plates (+ 1. 8 HU) and a good consistency between plates of the same nominal breast density equivalence (+ 1. 5 HU). In addition, dual energy CT provided mono-energetic HU from which mono-energetic linear attenuation coefficients of water and glandular and adipose equivalent materials were computed. The values for these coefficients were found in good agreement with results from literature, respectively direct mono-energetic measurements of breast samples, and computation by combining published <b>breast</b> <b>tissue</b> atomic compositions and linear attenuation coefficient tables.

To evaluate this hypothesis in breast cancer, we have prospectively studied {{the association between}} levels of fatty acids stored in breast adipose tissue and {{the response of the}} tumour to chemotherapy in 56 patients with an initially localized breast carcinoma. <b>Adipose</b> <b>breast</b> <b>tissue</b> was obtained at the time of biopsy, and individual fatty acids were measured as a percentage of total fatty acids using capillary gas chromatography. Patients then received primary chemotherapy, combining mitoxantrone, vindesine, cyclophosphamide and 5 -fluorouracil every 4 weeks. Tumour size was reassessed after three cycles of chemotherapy. Tumour response was evaluated according to World Health Organization criteria. Complete or partial response to chemotherapy was achieved in 26 patients (47 %). Level of n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in adipose tissue was higher in the group of patients with complete or partial response to chemotherapy than in patients with no response or with tumour progression (P < 0. 004). Among n- 3 polyunsaturated, only docosahexaenoic acid (22 : 6 n- 3) was significantly associated with tumour response (P < 0. 005).

40|$|Digital breast tomosynthesis is {{a recent}} three {{dimensional}} imaging modality that allows visualization of the breast as a stack of parallel slices. When compared to projection mammography, tomosynthesis is preferred for visualizing mass lesions while mammography is preferred for microcalcifications. In clinical evaluations, the diagnostic accuracy of tomosynthesis {{is at least as}} good as that of mammography, and both modalities combined outperform mammography used alone. Technical evaluations show that iterative reconstruction methods perform better than filtered backprojection reconstruction, which was used in most of the clinical evaluations. Therefore, the goal of this work was to design and evaluate a maximum a posteriori reconstruction algorithm for digital breast tomosynthesis with a focus on the visualization of microcalcifications. The first step was to implement a sequence of preprocessing steps to account for the typical assumptions of mono-energetic and scatter-free data acquisition used in iterative reconstruction. With this precorrection, reconstructed attenuation values of <b>adipose</b> <b>breast</b> <b>tissue</b> was found to be close to the expected theoretical value. A further examination of the difference between scatter precorrection and model based scatter correction during reconstruction was performed by evaluating the contrast to noise ratio of simulated masses in patient data. Results showed that the application of either correction method resulted in a similar contrast to noise ratio, which meant precorrection was preferred due to the lower computational cost. The second part of the work concentrates on developing a maximum a posteriori reconstruction algorithm for breast tomosynthesis. To improve visualization of microcalcifications, a resolution model based on the motion of the x-ray source during image acquisition was combined with a grouped coordinate ascent algorithm that sequentially updated planes parallel to the detector, each with their own position dependent parameters for the resolution model. This new method was evaluated in reconstructions of a simulated power law background containing microcalcifications and resulted in higher contrast to noise ratio when compared to iterative reconstruction without resolution model and improved detectability in a free search observer experiment when compared to filtered backprojection. One drawback of the plane-by-plane updates in this method was the need for careful initialization of the reconstruction volume in order to avoid severe limited angle artifacts. To remedy this problem and to further accelerate convergence, multigrid updates were implemented, and an update scheme was selected that combined the least amount of artifacts and the best convergence after a fixed computational cost. A further comparison was made with a popular alternative update method using ordered subsets rather than plane-by-plane updates, and found that when using an optimal multigrid sequence, both update methods resulted in similar performance. The final parts of this work focused on the evaluation of reconstruction methods. A channelized Hotelling observer was designed to detect groups of five microcalcifications in a background of acrylic spheres, and was applied to optimize the detectability of these microcalcifications {{as a function of the}} smoothing prior. The model observer correlated well with human observer evaluations of the same data, and found that detectability only varied slightly over a large range of strengths for the quadratic and combined quadratic and total variation priors. Therefore, it was not possible to pick an optimal smoothness based only on this criterion. On the other hand, with this information, the smoothing in the reconstruction could be set according to radiologist preference without worrying about calcification detectability. This model observer was then applied together with evaluations by a group of expert and non-expert human observers to compare three reconstruction algorithms for breast tomosynthesis. These were the iterative reconstruction developed in this work, the existing filtered backprojection of the Siemens Mammomat Inspiration system, and a new super-resolution filtered backprojection with post-reconstruction denoising. The evaluation consisted of a four-alternative forced-choice experiment to determine microcalcification and mass detectability in phantom data, and a visual grading study on patient data. Both new reconstruction methods showed improved performance on the lesion detection task compared to the system filtered backprojection, but resulted in significantly different overall appreciation of image quality in the visual grading study. From these results and the feedback from the radiologists that participated in the study, we can conclude that the new super-resolution filtered backprojection can replace the original system reconstruction in the clinic. Although the new iterative reconstruction improved the detectability of microcalcifications significantly, the unfamiliar properties of the images were not received as positive by the radiologists. Therefore further development of the iterative reconstruction should focus on artifact reduction and improving image contrast, and should use frequent clinical input in order to obtain a more familiar look and feel (noise pattern, contrast, …) for the radiologists. status: publishe...|$|E

The T- 1 and T- 2 TSE temperature (T) dependence could be fitted well with an exponential function of 1 /T. A linear relationship between T- 2 and temperature was found. The temperature coefficients (mean +/- inter-sample standard deviation) of T- 1 and T- 2 TSE increased from 25 degrees C (dT(1) /dT = 5. 35 +/- 0. 08 ms/degrees C, dT(2 TSE) /dT = 3. 82 +/- 0. 06 ms/degrees C) to 65 degrees C (dT(1) /dT = 9. 50 +/- 0. 16 ms/degrees C, dT(2 TSE) /dT = 7. 99 +/- 0. 38 ms/degrees C). The temperature coefficient of T- 2 was 0. 90 +/- 0. 03 ms/degrees C. The temperature-induced changes in the relaxation times were found to be reversible after heating to 65 degrees C.

40|$|Introduction Breast {{cancer is}} the most {{frequent}} malignant disease in women. Exposure to estrogens throughout a woman's life is {{a risk factor for}} the development of breast cancer. Organochlorine compounds (OCCs), such as pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls, are persistent lipophilic chemicals identified as endocrine disruptors, mainly with estrogenic effects. To test the hypothesis that the amount and quality of organochlorine residues in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> adjacent to <b>breast</b> carcinoma affect the biological behavior of the tumor, we studied biomarker expression in breast carcinoma and the OCC body burden in patients from an urban area adjacent to Paraná fluvial system, Argentina. Methods The studied patients were 55 women who had undergone excision biopsies of a breast lesion diagnosed as invasive breast carcinoma. Analysis of OCC residues in <b>breast</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> was conducted by electron-capture gas–liquid chromatography. Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), progesterone receptor (PR) and proliferative activity (Ki- 67) levels were measured in paraffin-embedded biopsies of breast tumors by immunohistochemistry. Results All patients had high levels of organochlorine pesticides in their <b>breast</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue.</b> The most frequently detected compounds were p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene, hexachlorobenzene and β-hexachlorocyclohexane. When the whole sample was analyzed, no correlation between ERα or PR expression and OCC levels were found. In the subgroup of ERα- positive breast carcinoma patients, however, there was a positive correlation between PR expression (an estrogeninduced protein) in the neoplastic cells and OCC levels in adipose tissue surrounding the tumor. More significantly, all the ERα-positive breast carcinomas from postmenopausal women exhibited high proliferation when organochlorine levels in the surrounding adipose tissue reached levels higher than 2600 ppb. No associations were found between the organochlorine body burden and any other marker of tumor aggressiveness, such as node involvement or tumor size. Conclusion The present results support the hypothesis that organochlorine residues in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> adjacent to <b>breast</b> carcinoma generate an estrogenic microenvironment that may influence the biological behavior of the tumor through ERα activation and ERα-dependent proliferation. These findings may have therapeutic implications, since interference between organochlorine compounds and hormonal therapy could be expected to occur...|$|R

40|$|Estrogen {{biosynthesis}} in {{adipose tissue}} has assumed great significance {{in terms of}} a number of estrogen-related diseases. The biosynthesis of estrogens from C 19 steroids is catalyzed by a specific form of cytochrome P 450, namely aromatase cytochrome P 450 (P 450 arom; the product of the CYP 19 gene). The human CYP 19 gene comprises nine coding exons, II–X, and its transcripts are expressed in the ovary, placenta, testes, adipose tissue, and brain. Tissue-specific expression of the CYP 19 gene is determined at least in part by the use of tissuespecific promoters, which give rise to transcripts with unique 5 �noncoding termini. Thus, the distal promoter I. 1 is responsible for expression uniquely in placenta.

40|$|Estrone is {{the most}} {{abundant}} estrogen after the menopause. We developed a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric method (LC-MS/MS) for determination of estrone in adipose tissue. Subcutaneous <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> from the <b>breast</b> was collected during elective surgery in postmenopausal women undergoing mastectomy for treatment of breast cancer (n = 13) or reduction mammoplasty (controls, n = 11). Homogenized adipose tissue was extracted with organic solvents and the estrone fraction was purified by LH- 20 column chromatography from the excess of lipids. The concentration of estrone was analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The method was accurate with an intra-assay variation of 8 % and an interassay variation of 10 %. The median concentration of estrone in subcutaneous <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> from the <b>breast</b> did not differ between breast cancer and control women, 920 pmol/kg and 890 pmol/kg, respectively. In breast cancer patients {{but not in the}} controls, <b>breast</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> estrone levels correlated positively with the serum estrone concentration. In conclusion, the new method provides a reliable means to measure estrone concentrations in adipose tissue in postmenopausal women. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{established}} role of oestrogen in {{the development}} and progression of breast cancer raises questions concerning a potential contribution from the many chemicals in the environment which can enter the human breast and which have oestrogenic activity. A range of organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated bipheryls possess oestrogen-mimicking properties and have been measured in human <b>breast</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> and in human milk. These enter the breast from varied environmental contamination of food, water and air, and due to their lipophilic properties can accumulate in breast fat. However, it is emerging that the breast is also exposed to a range of oestrogenic chemicals applied as cosmetics to the underarm and breast area. These cosmetics are left on the skin in the appropriate area, allowing a more direct dermal absorption route for breast exposure to oestrogenic chemicals and allowing absorbed chemicals to escape systemic metabolism. This review considers evidence in support of a functional role for the combined interactions of cosmetic chemicals with environmental oestrogens, pharmacological oestrogens, phyto-oestrogens and physiological oestrogens in the rising incidence of breast cancer...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{experimental}} and epidemiological evidence it is hypothesized that estrogen increases {{breast cancer risk}} by increasing mitotic activity in breast epithelial cells. Aromatase {{is crucial to the}} biosynthesis of estrogens and may therefore play a role in breast cancer development. Supporting data for an etiological role of aromatase in breast tumor biology are several-fold. First, the association between weight and postmenopausal breast cancer risk may be mediated by aromatase. Secondly, a pilot study found a higher aromatase expression in normal <b>breast</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> from <b>breast</b> cancer cases as opposed to healthy women. Thirdly, experimental data in animals suggest that aromatase activity predisposes mammary tissue to preneoplastic and neoplastic changes. In a multiethnic cohort study conducted in Los Angeles and on Hawaii we investigated (i) whether the plasma estrone to androstenedione (E 1 /A) ratio in different ethnic groups was associated with ethnic differences in breast cancer incidence, and (ii) whether genetic variation in the CYP 19 gene encoding the P 450 aromatase protein was associated with breast cancer risk. The age- and weight-adjusted ethnic specific E 1 /A ratios × 100 among women without oophorectomy were 7. 92 in African-Americans, 8. 22 in Japanese, 10. 73 in Latinas and 9. 29 in non-Latina Whites (P= 0. 09).

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to improve and apply MR thermometry techniques in fat -containing tissues. These thermometry methods were researched with the aim of applying them for MR-HIFU treatment of breast and liver tumors. The first study demonstrated the sensitivity of proton resonance frequency shift (PRFS) -based thermometry to heat-induced magnetic susceptibility changes and proposed a correction method. HIFU sonications of breast fat resulted in a magnetic field disturbance which completely disappeared after cooling. To evaluate the correction procedure, an interface of tissue-mimicking ethylene glycol gel and fat was sonicated. The PRFS-thermometry errors in the gel were greatly reduced by using the correction procedure. In the second study, the effect of the aqueous and fatty tissue magnetic susceptibility distribution on absolute and relative temperature measurements as obtained directly from the water/fat frequency difference was investigated. Absolute thermometry was investigated using spherical phantoms filled with pork and margarine. To evaluate relative fat referencing, multi-gradient echo scans were acquired before and after heating pork tissue by HIFU. The sphere experiment showed susceptibility-related errors of 8. 4 °C and 0. 2 °C for pork and margarine, respectively. For relative fat referencing, fat showed pronounced phase changes of opposite polarity to aqueous tissue. Variations in the observed frequency difference between water and fat are largely due to variations in the water/fat spatial distribution. This effect may lead to considerable errors in absolute MR thermometry. Additionally, fat referencing may exacerbate rather than correct for PRFS-temperature measurement errors. During MR-HIFU therapy, ultrasound absorption in the near field represents a safety risk and limits efficient energy deposition. The feasibility of using T 2 mapping to monitor the temperature change in subcutaneous adipose tissue was investigated. The T 2 temperature dependence and reversibility was determined for adipose porcine samples. The accuracy was evaluated by comparing T 2 -based temperature measurements with probe readings in an ex vivo HIFU experiment. T 2 changed linearly and reversibly with temperature with a coefficient of 5. 2 ± 0. 1 ms/°C. For the ex vivo experiment, the difference between the T 2 -based temperature change and probe was < 0. 9 °C. The reversibility and linearity of the T 2 -temperature dependence of adipose tissue allows for the monitoring of the temperature in the subcutaneous adipose tissue layers. Lastly, the T 1 and T 2 temperature dependence of female human <b>breast</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> at 1. 5 T was investigated in order to evaluate the applicability of relaxation-based MR thermometry for temperature monitoring in fat during thermal therapies. Relaxation times T 1, T 2, and T 2 TSE were measured in seven <b>adipose</b> <b>breast</b> samples for temperatures from 25 to 65 °C. Additionally, the heating-cooling reversibility was investigated. The T 1 and T 2 TSE temperature (T) dependence could be well fit with an exponential function of 1 /T. A linear relationship between T 2 and temperature was found. The temperature coefficient of T 2 was 0. 90 ± 0. 03 ms/°C. The temperature-induced changes in the relaxation times were found to be reversible after heating to 65 °C. Given the small inter-sample variation of the temperature coefficients, relaxation-based MR thermometry appears feasible in <b>breast</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{developed}} countries, {{the life}} expectancy of women is currently extending more than 30 years beyond the age of menopause. The menopausal transition {{is often associated with}} complaints. The conflicting results on the effectivity of phytoestrogens to alleviate menopausal symptoms. This discrepancy in treatment effect {{may be due to the}} large interindividual variation in isoflavone bioavailability in general and equol production in particular. Equol, a microbial metabolite of daidzein, has been hypothesized as a clue to the effectiveness of soy and its isoflavones, but only about 30 - 50 % of the population harbor an intestinal microbial ecosystem supporting the conversion of daidzein into equol. There is much concern on breast cancer, since this incidence of this disease increases with age. There is indication that soy phytoestrogens may decrease this breast cancer incidence. In order to evaluate the estrogenic potential of these exposure levels, we studied the isoflavone-derived E 2 α- and E 2 β-equivalents (i. e. 17 β-estradiol (E 2) -equivalents towards ERα and ERβ, respectively) in human <b>breast</b> <b>tissue.</b> Total isoflavones showed a <b>breast</b> adipose/glandular <b>tissue</b> distribution of 40 / 60 and their derived E 2 β-equivalents exceeded on average 21 ± 4 and 40 ± 10 times the endogenous E 2 concentrations in corresponding adipose and glandular biopsies, respectively, whereas the E 2 α/E 2 ratios were 0. 4 ± 0. 1 and 0. 8 ± 0. 2 in <b>adipose</b> and glandular <b>breast</b> <b>tissue,</b> respectively. These calculations suggest that, at least in this case, soy consumption could elicit partial ERβ agonistic effects in human <b>breast</b> <b>tissue.</b> We are currently characterizing the differential activation of estrogen-responsive genes between dietary isoflavones, the chemopreventive selective ER modulators tamoxifen and raloxifene and exogenous estrogens in a controlled dietary intervention trial that integrates data on the exposure to estrogenically active compounds, expression of isoflavone and estrogen target genes, and epigenetic events. During the menopause, there is a close relation between the drop in serum estrogen and negative metabolic changes such as the increase in bone resorption and negative change in the serum lipid profile. Randomized controlled trials measuring bone turnover markers in menopausal women revealed that soy isoflavone supplements significantly but moderately decrease the bone resorption marker urinary deoxypyridinoline without significant effects on the bone formation markers serum bone alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin...|$|R
