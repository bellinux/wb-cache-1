5|$|A hybrid eclipse (also called annular/total eclipse) shifts {{between a}} total and <b>annular</b> eclipse. At certain {{points on the}} surface of Earth, it appears as a total eclipse, whereas at other points it appears as <b>annular.</b> Hybrid eclipses are {{comparatively}} rare.|$|E
5|$|Central eclipse {{is often}} used as a generic term for a total, <b>annular,</b> or hybrid eclipse. This is, however, not {{completely}} correct: {{the definition of a}} central eclipse is an eclipse during which the central line of the umbra touches the Earth's surface. It is possible, though extremely rare, that part of the umbra intersects with the Earth (thus creating an <b>annular</b> or total eclipse), but not its central line. This is then called a non-central total or <b>annular</b> eclipse. The last (umbral yet) non-central solar eclipse was on April 29, 2014. This was an <b>annular</b> eclipse. The next non-central total solar eclipse will be on April 9, 2043.|$|E
5|$|During the 21st century, {{there will}} be 224 solar eclipses of which 77 will be partial, 72 will be <b>annular,</b> 68 will be total and 7 will be hybrids between total and <b>annular</b> eclipses. Of these, two <b>annular</b> and one total eclipse will be non-central, {{in the sense that}} the very center (axis) of the moon's shadow will miss the earth (for more {{information}} see gamma). In the 21st century the greatest number of eclipses in one year is four, in 2011, 2029, 2047, 2065, 2076, and 2094. The predictions given here are by Fred Espenak of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.|$|E
5|$|The table {{contains}} {{the date and}} time of the greatest eclipse (in dynamical time, {{which in this case}} is the time when the axis of the Moon's shadow cone passes closest to the centre of Earth; this is in Universal Time). The number of the saros series that the eclipse belongs to is given, followed by the magnitude of the eclipse (the fraction of the Sun's diameter obscured by the Moon) and the type of the eclipse (either total, <b>annular,</b> partial or hybrid). For total and <b>annular</b> eclipses, the duration of the eclipse is given, as well as the location of the greatest eclipse (the point of maximum eclipse) and the path width of the total or <b>annular</b> eclipse. The geographical areas from which the eclipse can be seen are listed.|$|E
5|$|As noted above, the Moon's orbit is also elliptical. The Moon's {{distance}} from the Earth can vary by about 6% from its average value. Therefore, the Moon's apparent size varies with its {{distance from}} the Earth, {{and it is this}} effect that leads to the difference between total and <b>annular</b> eclipses. The distance of the Earth from the Sun also varies during the year, but this is a smaller effect. On average, the Moon appears to be slightly smaller than the Sun as seen from the Earth, so the majority (about 60%) of central eclipses are <b>annular.</b> It is only when the Moon is closer to the Earth than average (near its perigee) that a total eclipse occurs.|$|E
5|$|An <b>annular</b> eclipse {{occurs when}} the Sun and Moon are exactly {{in line with the}} Earth, but the {{apparent}} size of the Moon is smaller than that of the Sun. Hence the Sun appears as a very bright ring, or annulus, surrounding the dark disk of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Jasmine (RSMC Nadi designation: 12F, JTWC designation: 10P) was a {{powerful}} and long-lived <b>annular</b> tropical cyclone that affected several countries, particularly Vanuatu and Tonga, over a 16-day span in February 2012. The system was the second cyclone and the only severe tropical cyclone of the relatively quiet 2011–12 South Pacific cyclone season. Cyclone Jasmine developed from an area of disturbed weather on 1February in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Initially, the storm moved towards the east and across the Cape York Peninsula. As it moved across the South Pacific, earlier existing wind shear conditions lessened, and Jasmine began to strengthen at a faster rate. Steadily intensifying, Jasmine reached peak intensity on 8February as a Category 4 equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, while beginning to show <b>annular</b> characteristics.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56-2 {{series is}} the {{original}} variant of the CFM56. It is most widely used in military applications where it {{is known as the}} F108; specifically in the KC-135, the E-6 Mercury and some E-3 Sentry aircraft. The CFM56-2 comprises a single-stage fan with 44 blades, with a three-stage LP compressor driven by a four-stage LP turbine, and a nine-stage HP compressor driven by a single-stage HP turbine. The combustor is <b>annular.</b>|$|E
5|$|The RAF sought more thrust {{than was}} {{available}} from the Avon 100 series; in response Rolls-Royce developed the Avon 200 series engine. This was an almost wholly new design, equipped with a new compressor {{to put an end}} to surge problems, an <b>annular</b> combustion chamber, and an improved fuel control system. The resulting Avon 203 produced 10,000lbf (44.48kN) of thrust, and was the engine for the Hunter F.6.|$|E
5|$|Viewed from Earth, the Moon is just {{far enough}} away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The angular size (or solid angle) of these two bodies match because, {{although}} the Sun's diameter is about 400 times {{as large as the}} Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant. This allows total and <b>annular</b> solar eclipses to occur on Earth.|$|E
5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as {{seen from the}} planet Earth) {{is a type of}} eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, and when the Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun. This can happen only at new moon when the Sun and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and <b>annular</b> eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.|$|E
5|$|Because the Earth's {{orbit around}} the Sun is also elliptical, the Earth's {{distance}} from the Sun similarly varies throughout the year. This affects the apparent size of the Sun in the same way, {{but not as much}} as does the Moon's varying distance from Earth. When Earth approaches its farthest distance from the Sun in early July, a total eclipse is somewhat more likely, whereas conditions favour an <b>annular</b> eclipse when Earth approaches its closest distance to the Sun in early January.|$|E
5|$|During {{a central}} eclipse, the Moon's umbra (or antumbra, {{in the case}} of an <b>annular</b> eclipse) moves rapidly from west to east across the Earth. The Earth is also {{rotating}} from west to east, at about 28km/min at the Equator, but as the Moon is moving in the same direction as the Earth's spin at about 61km/min, the umbra almost always appears to move in a roughly west-east direction across a map of the Earth at the speed of the Moon's orbital velocity minus the Earth's rotational velocity.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Daniel was {{the second}} strongest {{hurricane}} of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. The fourth named storm of the season, Daniel originated on July16 from a tropical wave {{off the coast of}} Mexico. It tracked westward, intensifying steadily to reach peak winds of 150mph (240km/h) on July22. At the time, the characteristics of the cyclone resembled those of an <b>annular</b> hurricane. Daniel gradually weakened as it entered an area of cooler water temperatures and increased wind shear, and after crossing into the Central Pacific Ocean, it quickly degenerated into a remnant low pressure area on July26.|$|E
5|$|Late on 7February, {{while still}} {{tracking}} to the east-southeast, Jasmine rapidly intensified, with wind speeds increasing to 185km/h (115mph), sustained for one minute. The cyclone developed a ragged eye stretching 40km (25mi) across. Later that day, Jasmine {{reached its peak}} intensity as it passed 280km (175mi) to the north-northeast of New Caledonia, with wind speeds of 215km/h (135mph), equivalent to a Category4 cyclone on both the Australian and Saffir-Simpson hurricane scales (SSHS). Throughout 8February, Jasmine began to show characteristics of an <b>annular</b> hurricane, maintaining a large, asymmetric eye and rather shallow convective features. In addition, multiple eyewall mesovorticies developed within the eye.|$|E
5|$|Launched in 1991, Japan's Yohkoh (Sunbeam) {{satellite}} observed solar flares at X-ray wavelengths. Mission data allowed {{scientists to}} identify several {{different types of}} flares, and demonstrated that the corona away from regions of peak activity was much more dynamic and active than had previously been supposed. Yohkoh observed an entire solar cycle but went into standby mode when an <b>annular</b> eclipse in 2001 caused it to lose its lock on the Sun. It was destroyed by atmospheric re-entry in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Most {{variants}} of the CFM56 feature a single-annular combustor. An <b>annular</b> combustor is a continuous ring where fuel is {{injected into the}} airflow and ignited, raising the pressure and temperature of the flow. Other types of combustors include can combustors, where each combustion chamber is separate, and canannular which is a hybrid of the two. Fuel injection is regulated by a Hydromechanical Unit (HMU), built by Honeywell. The HMU regulates the amount of fuel delivered to the engine {{by means of an}} electrohydraulic servo valve that, in turn, drives a fuel metering valve, that provides information to the full authority digital engine controller (FADEC).|$|E
5|$|On July19, {{the eye of}} Daniel became {{apparent}} on satellite imagery, which organized into a pinhole eye. It underwent an eyewall replacement cycle as it turned to the west-northwest, temporarily halting its intensification trend, before quickly strengthening and attaining major hurricane status on July20. Later that day, Hurricane Daniel organized into a very symmetric cyclone with a distinct eye about 30miles (50km) in diameter. Upon attaining Category4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, the cyclone resembled the appearance of an <b>annular</b> hurricane; an <b>annular</b> hurricane is one with a large and symmetric eye, surrounded by a thick ring of intense convection, and usually is able to maintain its intensity and structure for several days. On July 21 the hurricane underwent another eyewall replacement cycle. After completing the cycle, Daniel attained its peak winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) early on July 22. It maintained peak winds for about 18 hours, and Daniel began a weakening trend as it crossed into an area of progressively cooler water temperatures. The eye became more distinct on July 23, before the cloud tops again warmed as the winds decreased.|$|E
5|$|On a {{westerly}} course toward Taiwan {{and eastern}} China, Longwang underwent {{a period of}} rapid intensification from September27–28. At {{the end of this}} phase, the JMA assessed peak winds at 155km/h (100mph) while the JTWC rated it as a Category4-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. On September29, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assigned the typhoon the local name Maring as it entered their area of responsibility. The following day, Longwang underwent a structural change, transitioning from asymmetrical banding to symmetrical, making it an <b>annular</b> tropical cyclone. During the transition, upper-level divergence and outflow significantly decreased, resulting in temporary weakening of the typhoon. Additionally, an increase in westerly wind shear caused the interior structure to become asymmetric, with a southwest to northeast tilt noted by dropsondes released by the Dropwinsonde Observations for Typhoon Surveillance project. Once the transition into an <b>annular</b> cyclone completed, Longwang re-intensified and attained its peak intensity on October1 while situated 400km (250mi) south of Okinawa. The JMA assessed winds at 175km/h (110mph) along with a barometric pressure of 930mbar (hPa; 27.46inHg). The JTWC estimated Longwang to have been slightly stronger, with one-minute sustained winds of 230km/h (145mph).|$|E
5|$|Several other {{geometrical}} {{solutions to}} Apollonius' problem {{were developed in}} the 19th century. The most notable solutions are those of Jean-Victor Poncelet (1811) and of Joseph Diaz Gergonne (1814). Whereas Poncelet's proof relies on homothetic centers of circles {{and the power of}} a point theorem, Gergonne's method exploits the conjugate relation between lines and their poles in a circle. Methods using circle inversion were pioneered by Julius Petersen in 1879; one example is the <b>annular</b> solution method of HSM Coxeter. Another approach uses Lie sphere geometry, which was developed by Sophus Lie.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagrams}} to {{the right}} show the alignment of the Sun, Moon, and Earth during a solar eclipse. The dark gray region between the Moon and Earth is the umbra, where the Sun is completely obscured by the Moon. The small area where the umbra touches Earth's surface is where a total eclipse can be seen. The larger light gray area is the penumbra, in which a partial eclipse can be seen. An observer in the antumbra, the area of shadow beyond the umbra, will see an <b>annular</b> eclipse.|$|E
5|$|The three {{cylinders}} of each bogie {{were cast}} in mono-block format, each surrounded by two <b>annular</b> inlet steam chests {{and a single}} large outlet steam chest. These had the added function of keeping the cylinder heated by hot steam to maintain the temperature and pressure of steam entering the cylinders. However, these castings were difficult to machine accurately. The steam-sealing arrangements needed for this system were also complex, {{with each of the}} six cylinders and valve sleeves requiring 24 sealing rings.|$|E
5|$|Viewing the Sun during partial and <b>annular</b> eclipses (and during total eclipses {{outside the}} {{brief period of}} totality) {{requires}} special eye protection, or indirect viewing methods if eye damage is to be avoided. The Sun's disk can be viewed using appropriate filtration to block the harmful part of the Sun's radiation. Sunglasses do not make viewing the Sun safe. Only properly designed and certified solar filters {{should be used for}} direct viewing of the Sun's disk. Especially, self-made filters using common objects such as a floppy disk removed from its case, a Compact Disc, a black colour slide film, smoked glass, etc. must be avoided.|$|E
5|$|A {{partial eclipse}} {{occurs when the}} Sun and Moon are not exactly {{in line with the}} Earth and the Moon only {{partially}} obscures the Sun. This phenomenon can usually be seen from {{a large part of the}} Earth outside of the track of an <b>annular</b> or total eclipse. However, some eclipses can only be seen as a partial eclipse, because the umbra passes above the Earth's polar regions and never intersects the Earth's surface. Partial eclipses are virtually unnoticeable in terms of the sun's brightness, as it takes well over 90% coverage to notice any darkening at all. Even at 99%, it would be no darker than civil twilight. Of course, partial eclipses (and partial stages of other eclipses) can be observed if one is viewing the sun through a darkening filter (which should always be used for safety).|$|E
5|$|After development, Dora was steered {{towards the}} {{northwest}} by a ridge over the Southwestern United States. Situated {{in an area}} of favorable atmospheric conditions and warm sea surface temperatures, the tropical cyclone quickly strengthened, developing an intermittent eye before being classified as a hurricane at 1800UTC on July19. At the time, the storm was roughly 245mi (400km) south-southwest of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca. Upon reaching hurricane status, Dora began an episode of rapid intensification as its inner structure became more well-defined and its eye more permanent. At the same time, mesovorticies within the eye—often indicators of intense tropical cyclones—were noted on satellite imagery. By 1800UTC on July20, Dora had attained the threshold for major hurricane status. After acquiring some characteristics of an <b>annular</b> hurricane early on July21, Dora reached its peak intensity at 1200UTC that day with a minimum barometric pressure of 929mbar (hPa; 27.43inHg) and maximum sustained winds of 155mph (250km/h), making it a high-end Category4 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale.|$|E
5|$|After {{slightly}} weakening {{throughout the}} day on August6, Felicia leveled out with winds of 135mph (215km/h) and a 23mi (37km) wide eye as the storm developed characteristics of an <b>annular</b> hurricane, which would allow Felicia to maintain a high intensity over marginally warm waters. Early the next day, {{the structure of the}} hurricane quickly deteriorated as convection became asymmetric and cloud tops warmed significantly. This marked a quick drop in intensity of the storm to a minimal Category 3 hurricane. Several hours later, the mid-level circulation began to separate from the low-level circulation and the overall size of the storm decreased. By this time, the storm began to take a long-anticipated westward turn towards Hawaii. After briefly re-intensifying on August7, Felicia weakened to a Category 1 hurricane early on August8. Around 11:00am HST (2100UTC), the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) took over responsibility of issuing advisories as Felicia crossed longitude 140°W.|$|E
5|$|Although {{favorable}} conditions {{allowed for}} the uninhibited growth of Iselle early in its development, moderate wind shear briefly impacted the hurricane on August2, preventing thunderstorms from intensifying and causing the storm to become slightly malformed vertically. However, these conditions abated shortly afterwards, allowing Iselle to resume strengthening and reach Category2hurricane status late that same day. With wind shear no longer impinging on the organization of Iselle, the tropical cyclone gradually became more symmetric, allowing for the hurricane's once ragged eye to clear itself of cloud cover and the storm to intensify to major hurricane status on August3. Attaining some <b>annular</b> tropical cyclone characteristics, Iselle reaching Category4 strength at 12:00UTC on August4. Consequently, Iselle reached peak intensity at 18:00UTC with maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 947mbar (hPa; 27.96inHg). At the same time, the hurricane exhibited an 30mi (45km) eye across.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{one out of}} one {{thousand}} children suffer some type of congenital deafness related {{to the development of}} the inner ear. Inner ear congenital anomalies are related to sensorineural hearing loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Hearing loss problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development is separate from that of the middle and external ear. Middle ear anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the <b>annular</b> stapedial ligament. Temporal bone and ear canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{the longest}} {{duration}} {{in which the}} moon completely covered the sun, known as totality, was during the solar eclipse of July 22, 2009. This total solar eclipse had a maximum duration of 6 minutes and 39 seconds. The longest possible duration of a total solar eclipse is 7 minutes and 32 seconds. The longest <b>annular</b> solar eclipse of the 21st century took place on January 15, 2010, {{with a duration of}} 11 minutes and 8 seconds. The maximum possible duration is 12 minutes and 29 seconds. The eclipse of May 20, 2050, will be the second hybrid eclipse in the span of less than one year, the first one being on November 25, 2049.|$|E
5|$|Historical eclipses {{are a very}} {{valuable}} resource for historians, in that they allow a few historical events to be dated precisely, from which other dates and ancient calendars may be deduced. A solar eclipse of June 15, 763 BC mentioned in an Assyrian text {{is important for the}} chronology of the ancient Near East. There have been other claims to date earlier eclipses. The Book of Joshua 10:13 could refer to an <b>annular</b> eclipse on 30 October 1207 BC. The King Zhong Kang supposedly beheaded two astronomers, Hsi and Ho, who failed to predict an eclipse 4,000 years ago. Perhaps the earliest still-unproven claim is that of archaeologist Bruce Masse, who putatively links an eclipse that occurred on May 10, 2807 BC with a possible meteor impact in the Indian Ocean on the basis of several ancient flood myths that mention a total solar eclipse.|$|E
5|$|If {{the date}} and time of any solar eclipse are known, it is {{possible}} to predict other eclipses using eclipse cycles. The saros is probably the best known {{and one of the most}} accurate. A saros lasts 6,585.3 days (a little over 18 years), which means that, after this period, a practically identical eclipse will occur. The most notable difference will be a westward shift of about 120° in longitude (due to the 0.3 days) and a little in latitude (north-south for odd-numbered cycles, the reverse for even-numbered ones). A saros series always starts with a partial eclipse near one of Earth's polar regions, then shifts over the globe through a series of <b>annular</b> or total eclipses, and ends with a partial eclipse at the opposite polar region. A saros series lasts 1226 to 1550 years and 69 to 87 eclipses, with about 40 to 60 of them being central.|$|E
5|$|On December1, Epsilon began a {{northeast}} motion due to {{an approaching}} trough, {{and the next day}} it attained hurricane status. After turning to the east, it developed characteristics of an <b>annular</b> hurricane, meaning it had a circular eye, a ring of convection, and had few fluctuations in its intensity. On December5 Epsilon attained peak winds of 85mph (140km/h), and the next day it turned to the south and southwest. Late on December7, the winds dropped below hurricane status {{for the first time in}} five days, making Epsilon the longest-lasting December hurricane on record. Stronger wind shear caused rapid weakening, and the storm could no longer be classified as a tropical cyclone late on December8. The next day the remnant circulation of Epsilon dissipated.|$|E
5|$|Total solar eclipses {{are seen}} on Earth {{because of a}} fortuitous {{combination}} of circumstances. Even on Earth, the diversity of eclipses familiar to people today is a temporary (on a geological time scale) phenomenon. Hundreds {{of millions of years}} in the past, the Moon was closer to the Earth and therefore apparently larger, so every solar eclipse was total and there were no <b>annular</b> eclipses. Due to tidal acceleration, the orbit of the Moon around the Earth becomes approximately 3.8cm more distant each year. Millions of years in the future, the Moon will be too far away to fully occlude the Sun, and no total eclipses will occur. In the same timeframe, the Sun may become brighter, making it appear larger in size. Estimates of the when the moon will be unable to occlude the entire sun when viewed from the Earth range between 1.4 billion and 650 million years in the future.|$|E
5|$|Under normal conditions, the Sun is {{so bright}} {{that it is}} {{difficult}} to stare at it directly. However, during an eclipse, with so much of the Sun covered, it is easier and more tempting to stare at it. Looking at the Sun during an eclipse is as dangerous as looking at it outside an eclipse, except during the brief period of totality, when the Sun's disk is completely covered (totality occurs only during a total eclipse and only very briefly; it does not occur during a partial or <b>annular</b> eclipse). Viewing the Sun's disk through any kind of optical aid (binoculars, a telescope, or even an optical camera viewfinder) is extremely hazardous and can cause irreversible eye damage within a fraction of a second.|$|E
5|$|With these {{modifications}} {{complete and}} apparently working, the first completely free flight occurred on 12 November 1959. This test proved the nozzle control system unacceptable. The spoilers {{were intended to}} direct the air out over the top or bottom of the <b>annular</b> flap, out the bottom only during hover, but {{over the top and}} bottom during forward flight. The idea was that when the flap was positioned in order to provide control, the lift would be lowered on one side and raised on the other. Lift was indeed lowered on one side, but sadly the lift did not improve on the other, so every control input resulted in a loss of altitude. After five flights, testing was temporarily halted on 5 December 1959, by which time the Avrocar had logged 18.5 hours of test time in total.|$|E
5|$|Eclipses {{have been}} {{interpreted}} as omens, or portents. The ancient Greek historian Herodotus wrote that Thales of Miletus predicted an eclipse {{that occurred during}} a battle between the Medes and the Lydians. Both sides put down their weapons and declared peace {{as a result of}} the eclipse. The exact eclipse involved remains uncertain, although the issue has been studied by hundreds of ancient and modern authorities. One likely candidate took place on May 28, 585 BC, probably near the Halys river in Asia Minor. An eclipse recorded by Herodotus before Xerxes departed for his expedition against Greece, which is traditionally dated to 480 BC, was matched by John Russell Hind to an <b>annular</b> eclipse of the Sun at Sardis on February 17, 478 BC. Alternatively, a partial eclipse was visible from Persia on October 2, 480 BC. Herodotus also reports a solar eclipse at Sparta during the Second Persian invasion of Greece. The date of the eclipse (August 1, 477 BC) does not match exactly the conventional dates for the invasion accepted by historians.|$|E
