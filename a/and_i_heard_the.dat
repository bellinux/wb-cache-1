2500|$|You know, {{its engine}} sound was {{different}} from other planes; that is, the president's engine's sound ... We were looking towards where the plane was coming from, and we saw a projectile and we saw a ball of flame or flash and we saw the plane go down; and I saw it. I {{was the leader of}} the bloc so I asked the soldiers to get up and I told them [...] "Get up because Kinani [...] has been shot down.' They told me, [...] "You are lying." [...] I said, [...] "It's true." [...] So I opened my wardrobe, I put on my uniform <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> bugle sound.|$|E
60|$|Then {{they spoke}} inaudible things, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> Satyr laughing.|$|E
60|$|Ray nodded abruptly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> {{door of my}} cottage {{open and}} close behind him.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{momentary}} pause; <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> boy's voice once more.|$|R
60|$|Then {{they were}} gone <b>and</b> {{presently}} <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> sound of horses being driven rapidly along the drive.|$|R
60|$|Once {{more the}} door opened <b>and</b> shut. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> swish of her skirts as she came over towards me.|$|R
60|$|We all trooped {{out into}} the corridor, leaving the two doctors alone, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> key turned in the lock behind us.|$|E
60|$|She left {{me to sit}} {{a little}} longer by the screen, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> sound of her feet die out along the gallery above.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir, she demeaned {{herself with}} distinction; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> French gentlemen {{say she was}} 'pétrie d'esprit et de graces.' Dr. Bretton thought the same." ...|$|E
60|$|Saluting, he too {{passed away}} into <b>the</b> dark, <b>and</b> {{presently}} <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> sounds of spear-blades striking together and of rifles being cocked.|$|R
60|$|Ten minutes {{may have}} passed, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> clatter of many steps, and {{a knot of}} men came {{clustering}} through the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{answers the}} description," [...] said <b>the</b> sergeant, <b>and</b> though <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> words <b>I</b> took no {{thought that it}} was of me they spoke.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Signor, no. It was a fair, healthy bambina {{of a year}} old, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> mother boasting that it {{had never}} had a day's illness.' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{report of}} Jim's musket had been {{followed}} by the discharge of a pistol, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> lad running across the floor at full speed.|$|E
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> gentle pieman in {{the road}} behind me trilling, [...] "'Tira, lira!' stop him, stop him! 'Tra! la! la!' the soup's a shilling!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{they look}} {{whenever}} you meet them [...] Like broken-hearted men, [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> that <b>the</b> sick man would not [...] If he could, be well again; ...|$|R
60|$|The classes formed another building; {{the hall}} parted {{them from the}} dwelling-house: despite {{distance}} <b>and</b> partition, <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> sudden stir of numbers, a whole division rising at once.|$|R
60|$|I {{walked over}} to a table where I had left my cane <b>and</b> gloves. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> whirr of the alarm in the cab below <b>and</b> <b>I</b> turned quickly. Van Sweller was gone.|$|R
6000|$|She sang, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> singing, [...] Far out of {{the wretched}} past, [...] Of meadow-larks in the meadow, [...] In a {{breathing}} of the blast.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did. I {{was looking}} at him. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> crash, too--something awful. Like the {{mainmast}} going overboard. It was as if something had struck him." ...|$|E
60|$|A tapping {{came at the}} door, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> glutinous accents of M'ling speaking. I {{pocketed}} one of the revolvers (keeping {{one hand}} upon it), and opened to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's glad I am to see you, Master Walter, entirely. I {{have been}} {{listening}} ever since you went, <b>and,</b> when <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> tramp of feet, I made sure it was the boys." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{took a step}} forward, {{but before}} I could gain the threshold, the door was slammed in my face, <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> stood there, quivering with anger <b>and</b> disappointment, <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> bolts being shot within.|$|R
60|$|But no; I held {{firmly to}} Paley. There {{was no such}} name among her lodgers. Click! the door closed swiftly in my face; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> through <b>the</b> panels the clanking of chains and bolts.|$|R
60|$|The servant went, and, {{after a while}} {{of waiting}} that seemed long, once more the door was opened, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> sweep of a woman's dress upon the carpet.|$|E
60|$|Coffined {{thoughts}} around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words. Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> {{voice of}} that Egyptian highpriest. In painted chambers loaded with tilebooks.|$|E
6000|$|... "Rats! It wasn't {{anything}} of the kind," [...] protested Carl. [...] "I was there <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> whole thing. He just explained what this Bernard Shaw that writes plays meant by socialism." ...|$|E
5000|$|Yes, I {{a murderer}} was by rage [...] propell'd; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> last harsh decree, {{but if the}} maniac is a murderer held, say cool {{deliberate}} actors, what are ye? ...|$|R
6000|$|They told me then, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>the</b> haunted Red Room {{as one who}} bears a tale. [...] "We {{found you}} at dawn," [...] said he, [...] "and there was blood on your {{forehead}} and lips." ...|$|R
6000|$|He left <b>the</b> room, <b>and</b> {{presently}} <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> {{sound of}} running footsteps. The door was opened, and Mary Phillips entered, closely {{followed by the}} captain. I started back; I shouted as if I had a speaking-trumpet to my mouth:-- ...|$|R
60|$|There was silence, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> Maid's iron tread pass {{down the}} {{creaking}} wooden stairs, and soon I {{heard the sound}} of singing birds, for my window looked out on the garden.|$|E
6000|$|I {{stopped and}} looked back, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> pad, pad of Cavor's feet receding. Then he stopped also. [...] "Bedford," [...] he whispered; [...] "there's a sort of light in front of us." ...|$|E
60|$|Two {{good results}} {{followed}} the ready {{rendering of the}} help I had asked from my host's daughters. I succeeded with my portrait of Mademoiselle Clairfait, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> story which occupies the following pages.|$|E
6000|$|I have past {{by about}} that hour [...] When {{men are not}} most brave, [...] It did not make my heart to fail, [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> {{nightingale}} [...] Sing sweetly on her grave.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don Frederic {{has taken}} it; the Spaniards have butchered them; everyone, old and young, men, women, and children, {{they are all}} butchered. I escaped, but for two leagues <b>and</b> more <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> sound of the death-wail of Mechlin. Give me wine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Mr. Van Weyden!” he cried, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> through <b>the</b> tumult as {{one might}} hear a whisper. “Stand by that jib with Johnson and Oofty! The rest of you tail aft to the mainsheet! Lively now! or I’ll sail you all into Kingdom Come! Understand?” ...|$|R
