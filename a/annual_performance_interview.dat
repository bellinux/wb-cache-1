40|$|The DOE Solar Energy Technologies Program {{includes}} a sub-key activity entitled ''Photovoltaic Module Reliability R&D''. This activity {{has been in}} existence for several years to help ensure that the PV technologies that advance to the commercial module stage have acceptable service lifetimes and <b>annual</b> <b>performance</b> degradation rates. The long-term (2020) goal, {{as stated in the}} Solar Program Multi-Year Technical Plan [1], is to assist industry with the development of PV systems that have 30 -year service lifetimes and 1 % <b>annual</b> <b>performance</b> degradation rates. The corresponding module service lifetimes and <b>annual</b> <b>performance</b> degradation rate would have to be 30 years lifetime and approximately 0. 5 % (or less, {{depending on the type of}} PV system) <b>annual</b> <b>performance</b> degradation. Reaching this goal is critical to achieving the PV technology Levelized Energy Cost Targets, as listed and described in the Solar Program Multi-Year Technical Plan. This paper is an overview of the Module Reliability R&D sub-key activity. More details and the major results and accomplishments are covered in the papers presented in the PV Module Reliability Session of the DOE Solar Energy Technology Review Meeting, October 25 - 28, 2004, in Denver, Colorado...|$|R
