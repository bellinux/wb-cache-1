5|$|Among his {{considerations}} as a curator, Nzewi {{cites the}} importance of art history and his curiosity in how artworks reveal collective social imagination through expression and interpretation. He has expressed interest in learning from the creative process as artists make intellectual decisions <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>work</b> on reflection of {{how it will be}} received by others and the market. He has published essays in multiple academic art journals, contributed to Grove Art Online, and co-edited a volume on independent African art initiatives.|$|E
5|$|In 1976 Josephson {{travelled}} to California to meet {{two leading}} {{members of the}} group, laser physicists Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff, authors of Mind Reach (1977). Targ and Puthoff {{had set up a}} parapsychology ("psi") lab at SRI and had had papers published <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>work</b> – which included testing later-discredited claims by Uri Geller that he could make objects move using psychokinesis – in Nature and other peer-reviewed journals. The San Francisco Chronicle covered Josephson's visit.|$|E

The world premiere took place May 11, 2013 in Wuppertal, Germany {{where it was}} performed twice by the Wuppertal Symphony Orchestra at the venue Historische Stadthalle Wuppertal. A performance by the London Symphony Orchestra took place May 30, 2013 in London at the Barbican Centre. It marked the first live performance of video game music by the London Symphony Orchestra, making a historical moment for the Final Fantasy franchise and video game music in general. At Final Symphony in Wuppertal and London, Nobuo Uematsu and Masashi Hamauzu were in attendance. At the performances by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, both composers talked <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>work</b> on the series on stage of the Tokyo Bunka Kaikan concert venue. Final Symphony Tokyo was the first video game music concert ever to be greeted with standing ovations in Japan.|$|E
5|$|In early 2001, Boisselier {{promised the}} cloning {{of a human}} child within a year, drawing further {{attention}} to her work. A prosecutor in New York began investigating her compliance with local medical laws. Boisselier said that the Food and Drug Administration also surreptitiously investigated her, and Raël claimed that U.S. President George W. Bush was concerned about Clonaid's work. The caretaker of the laboratory that Hunt had rented grew suspicious <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>work</b> and contacted law enforcement. They spoke with the FDA, who searched the site and persuaded Boisselier to suspend her cloning work pending legal clarification. After Hunt {{was asked by the}} laboratory's caretaker to shut down the cloning operation, he broke with Boisselier and criticized her for seeking media attention. The caretaker also spoke publicly, saying that Boisselier was seldom at the laboratory. Boisselier then announced that she was moving her cloning operations overseas. Boisselier never faced any legal charges in connection with the laboratory.|$|E

50|$|His best-known plays are Die Jäger, Dienstpflicht, Die Advokaten, Die Mündel and Die Hagstolzen. Iffland {{was also}} a {{dramatic}} critic, and German actors placed high value on his reasonings and hints <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>works</b> in his Almanach für Theater und Theaterfreunde. During 1798-1802 he issued his Dramatischen Werke in sixteen volumes, to which he added an autobiography (Meine theatralische Laufbahn). During 1807-1809 Iffland put out two volumes of Neue dramatische Werke. Selections from his writings were later published, one in two volumes, the other in ten volumes.|$|R
25|$|The Confederacy, being {{limited in}} skilled {{engravers}} and printers {{as well as}} secure printing facilities, often had {{to make do with}} unrelated designs in early banknote issues. Some such were abstract depictions of mythological gods and goddesses, such as the Goddess of Liberty. Confederate themes did prevail with designs of black slaves, naval ships and historical figures, including George Washington. Images of slaves often had them depicted as smiling or happily carrying <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
25|$|Such {{details are}} corroborated by many other sources. Accounts {{of the actions}} of the iconoclasts from eyewitnesses and the records of the later trials of many of them make it clear that there was often a {{considerable}} element of carnival to the outbreaks, with much mockery of the images and fittings such as fonts recorded as the iconoclasts went <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>work.</b> Alcohol features largely in very many accounts, perhaps in some cases because in Netherlandish law being drunk could be regarded as a mitigating factor in criminal sentencing.|$|E
25|$|Roger Smyth was {{the first}} of Trevor’s two Ph.D. {{students}} and Trevor always spoke enthusiastically <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>work</b> together, which spanned many years. Roger was employed as a civil servant in the Northern Ireland Department of Health and Social Services, and so did his Mathematics outside of his working hours. Apart from the fact that Trevor got on very well with Roger, it suited Trevor to have Roger among his Northern Ireland friends and informants on political matters. In a different way, Alastair Gillespie was well placed in Edinburgh where there were rugby matches to attend every now and again, while the Cork connection with Gerard was a different kind of overlap of interests. By the way, the collaboration with Rien Kaashoek did not seem to have any similar coincidence but they did travel often between Dublin and Amsterdam to collaborate. Rainer Nagel of Tubingen was also a close contact of Trevor’s but not a co-author.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the last}} few years, European {{institutions}} have committed to promoting transparency, openness, {{and the availability of}} information <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>work.</b> In particular, transparency is regarded as pivotal to the action of European institutions and a general principle of EU law, to be applied to the activities of EU institutions in order to strengthen the Union's democratic foundation. The general principles of openness and transparency are reaffirmed in the articles 8 A, point 3 and 10.3 of the Treaty of Lisbon and the Maastricht Treaty respectively, stating that [...] "every citizen shall have the right to participate in the democratic life of the Union. Decisions shall be taken as openly and as closely as possible to the citizen". Furthermore, both treaties acknowledge the value of dialogue between citizens, representative associations, civil society, and European institutions.|$|E
500|$|Music {{journalist}} Paul Lester locates [...] "the {{golden age}} of adroit, intelligent art-pop" [...] to when the bands 10cc, Roxy Music and Sparks [...] "were mixing and matching from different genres and eras, well before the term 'postmodern' existed in the pop realm." [...] The effect of the Velvet Underground gave rock musicians like Iggy Pop of the Stooges a self-consciousness <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>work.</b> Iggy was inspired to transform his personality into an art object, which would in turn influence singer David Bowie, {{and led to the}} Stooges' role as the group linking 1960s hard rock to 1970s punk. In the 1970s, a similarly self-conscious art/pop community (which Frith calls [...] "the most significant" [...] of the period) began to coalesce in the Mercer Arts Center in New York. The school encouraged the continuation of the kinds of collaboration between high and low art once exemplified by the Factory, as drummer Jerry Harrison (later of Talking Heads) explained: [...] "it started with the Velvet Underground and {{all of the things that}} were identified with Andy Warhol." ...|$|E
