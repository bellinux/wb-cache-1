40|$|Customer {{magazines}} are periodically published magazines with instructive and entertaining content, which are published by companies or branches for (potential) customers {{and which are}} usually free of charge. In Germany, there are currently more than 3500 customer magazine titles with a total circulation of 456 million copies, which shows the popularity of this communication medium. The most widely spread branch customer magazine Apotheken Umschau reports a monthly circulation of nearly 10 million copies {{and a range of}} about 20 million readers. However, customer magazines have hardly been analysed linguistically so far. The article presents a corpus-based study, which deals with textual functions of a pharmacy sector’s customer magazine. In this, the linguistic resources for (in) directly signalling the <b>appellative</b> <b>function</b> are analysed. The corpus consists of ten six to ten-page long, multi-module title issues of the Apotheken Umschau that were published between June and November 2008. The analysis of the title issues reveals a very large variety of linguistic resources which (in) directly signal the <b>appellative</b> <b>function.</b> In the article, the most common grammatical and lexical indicators of the <b>appellative</b> <b>function</b> are presented and illustrated by examples. Additionally, an exemplary quantitative analysis of one title issue is presented. It focuses on how frequently the respective linguistic resources occur and how they are distributed in the texts...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{is focused on}} knowing and applying one of the functions of language originally proposed by Roman Jakobson, but then it is {{taken up by the}} German translation scholar Christiane Nord in her famous Cuatrifuncional Model (Expressive, Phatic, Referential and Appellative functions) and the Spanish Francesc Fernández (2004). Our purpose in this research work is to delve into one of the functions of this model (<b>Appellative</b> <b>function)</b> but also identifying subfunctions selecting a particular action: Phatic Persuasive in a parallel corpus English – Spanish in the Book of Proverbs. The main aim {{of this study is to}} describe the variation of the aspects of persuasive phatic action in the base text and target text according to their purpose. Throughout this process of data collection for this research, we make a descriptive analysis of this function. Its language is appropriate and simple so there is understanding by every reader who is interested in the aspect of textual analysis and as such studies has been immersed in Translation Studies...|$|E

In order to adequately achieve its main functions and maximise communication efficiency, soft news must efficiently invite and engage its intended readers. On that account, when a soft news item is transedited into another language, the reader involvement initially {{constructed in the}} original news need to be appropriately adjusted for the target readers. Accordingly, this paper, utilising Nord‘s (1997) model of translation-oriented text functions as a theoretical framework, investigates a case study on English-Chinese soft news transediting conducted at the China Times in Taiwan (1) to compare the source and target text functions, and (2) to explore how the original reader involvement is mediated in the transedited news through various engagement expressions {{under the guidance of}} the target text functions. The results indicate that while the original reader involvement was generally retained in the target headlines, it was changed considerably in the main body part of the target news. The distance between the texts and readers was generally made closer in the transedited versions (1) with the addition of Deny and Counter resources to achieve the <b>appellative</b> <b>function,</b> and (2) with the replacement of Acknowledge expressions by those of Endorse to highlight the expressive function...|$|E

40|$|The {{village of}} Stryhantsi of Tysmenytsya District, Ivano-Frankivsk Region is located 30 km {{northeast}} of regional centre – city of Ivano-Frankivsk. It {{is considered to}} be founded in 1624. The village was mentioned on the map of the French engineer-cartographer Le Vasseur de Beauplan since 1650. Its basic part is located in a wide valley of the right bank of Dniester, 2 – 3 km of the very river. Local oro-objects are actively included into economic activity of people. Peculiarity of geographical location of the village and agricultural areas {{lies in the fact that}} part of them is located in the valley of Dniester, and the other part is located on tops of surrounding mountains which form a single plateau within a certain distance of the village that stretches to the east of the village towards Dniester. Therefore, both generalizing names (Na Hori, Na Dolyni) and specific names as to each separate mountain (na Stintsi, na Serednyomu Horbi, na Hirtsi, nad Zbochem) are used in colloquial speech. Modern oronymy of the village of Stryhantsi and its surroundings (in the language of Stryhantsi residents) is based on folk geographical lexis. Mountains surrounding the village and at the foot of which it is partially located have proper names formed in lexico-semantic way from <b>appellatives</b> which <b>function</b> either in Ukrainian literary language or in dialect speech: Hirka, Zbich, Seredniy Horb, Stinka, Skala. There are no proper names of foreign origin in oronymy of the village of Stryhantsi. Modern oronymy of the village of Stryhantsi and its surroundings is based on folk geographical lexicon. Mountains surrounding the village have their proper names created in lexico-semantic way from <b>appellatives</b> that <b>function</b> either in Ukrainian literary language or in Ukrainian dialect speech: Hirka, Zbich, Seredniy Horb, Skala, Stinka.

Polazeći od teorije kulturema Els Oksaar (1988), definiran je pojam kulturem, a zatim su predstavljene definicije i klasifikacije kulturno specifičnih pojmova onih autora koji se kulturemima bave na leksičkoj razini. Diskutiran je pojam ekvivalencije u lingvističkim prijevodnim znanostima te njegova relativizacija u funkcionalističkim teorijama prevođenja. Definiran je pojam nulte ekvivalencije na leksičkoj razini i izloženi su odgovarajući prijevodni postupci kod nulte ekvivalencije. U radu su nastavno izložene temeljne postavke funkcionalističkih translatoloških teorija: teorije skoposa (1984) i teorije prijevodnog djelovanja (1984). Važnu teorijsku podlogu u odnosu na provedeno empirijsko istraživanje čine i poglavlja u kojima su izložene temeljne značajke jezika struke i tekstne vrste jelovnik. Kako bi se analizirali prijevodni postupci za hrvatske kultureme iz područja gastronomije na njemačkom jeziku, istražen je korpus od 30 jelovnika ugostiteljskih objekata u Zadru te su izložene karakteristike zastupljenog vokabulara (analitički gastronomski nazivi, njihova motiviranost, posuđenice i strani nazivi). U osvrtu na kultureme iz područja gastronomije analizirana je struktura vokabulara u odnosu na zastupljene vrste riječi, motiviranost naziva, kvaliteta tekstova u odnosu na ukupnu jezičnu razinu i očekivanu realizaciju informativne i apelativne funkcije teksta. U ciljanom istraživanju primijenjenih prijevodnih postupaka ekscerpirani su hrvatski kulturemi i njihovi njemački prijevodi te je analizirana njihova usklađenost sa znanstvenim spoznajama funkcionalističkih translatoloških teorija. U popisu naziva jela na kraju rada na konkretnim je primjerima predstavljen prijevodni model koji na temelju izloženih teorijskih spoznaja nudi funkcionalna prijevodna rješenja za hrvatske gastronomske kultureme. Time cjelokupan rad dobiva i praktično primjenjiv doprinos koji može biti od koristi u području struke. Ovaj rad predstavlja prvo istraživanje lingvističkih i translatoloških aspekata kulturema iz područja gastronomije i daje doprinos u poticanju svijesti o važnosti kvalitetnih prijevoda na njemački jezik. Predložena prijevodna rješenja hrvatskih gastronomskih kulturema mogu imati neposrednu primjenu u praksi. This {{doctoral}} dissertation presents the first research ever into {{translation of the}} Croatian culturemes in gastronomy into the German language. In {{the first part of}} the dissertation theoretical issues are presented about all relevant aspects of this subject. The first chapter is focused on defining culture from the point of view of translatology. The definitions by the leading theoreticians in translatology and intercultural communication are considered and put forward in this chapter (Göhring 1978; Vermeer 1990; Ammann 1990; Nord 1993; Maletzke 1996; Witte 2007). These authors, in how they comprehend the notion of culture, emphasize the specific cultural patterns of behavior as well as linguistic and non-linguistic actions. This type of understanding culture in translatology results in stressing the intercultural competence of the translator, who needs to have, apart from linguistic competence, a high level of bicultural competence in his or her „working cultures“. In the excursus on food and diet the most important dates and inventions in history are highlighted. Numerous ingredients and new ways of preparing food have contributed to understanding food and feeding as a form of „cultural action“ and culinary habits that a person obtains in the process of enculturation make an important part of expressing his or her belonging culturally to a specific community. This implies that the translator, along with all other cultural aspects, needs to know very well the traditions and norms relating to dietary habits of the language communities he or she focuses on. These habits result in a series of culturally specific names relating to food and meals, and we call these culturemes. Starting with the theory of culturemes by Els Oksaar (1988), the dissertation continues with definitions and classifications by important scholars who approach culturemes at the lexical level. Barchudarow (1971), Kutz (1981), Newmark (1988), Gerzymisch-Arbogast (1994), Markstein (2006) develop various distributions of culturally specific notions and in doing so they use different names. However, they all emphasize in their work the names of meals as an indispensable part of cultural specificity, which reflect both the culture and the heritage of a nation. Along with emphasizing the cultural specificity of these terms, this dissertation will also emphasize their null equivalence at the lexical level as well as the translation procedures which are used to manage null equivalence. In this sense, Newmark (1988), Hansen (1996), Koller (2004), Markstein (2006), Schreiber (2006) and Lipavic-Oštir (2013; 2014) are underscored as well as the translation procedures that have been derived from their theoretical work. Considering that contemporary translatology completely relativizes the notion of „equivalence“ and underscores the functionality of translation, the main tenets of the functionalist skopos theory by K. Reiß and H. Vermeer (1984) are presented in the following part of the dissertation as well as the theory of translatorial action by J. Holz-Mänttäri (1984), which both emphasize the purpose which the translation, that is the target text needs to complete in the target culture. Having in mind that the translations of the Croatian culturemes into German are analyzed on the examples extracted from the text type 'menu', main theoretical notions about language for specific purposes are presented, with special emphasis on the language of gastronomy. In the part that focuses on the structure of the vocabulary of the language of gastronomy main features of that language are pointed out along with relevant examples from Croatian and German. What is especially highlighted in this part are the nominal style, unusual names of meals, their specific motivation, borrowings and internationalisms, verbs which denote various types of food preparation and sensory names with positive connotation for food and meals with specific adjectives. In relation to syntax, weak text cohesion or complete lack of cohesion is stressed. All the listed features of the language for specific purposes are linked with professional papers about gastronomy which handle, in compliance with the functionalist approach, conventionalized and culturally conditioned patterns of language use, systematized forms, conventional text structures and the lexicon. The empirical part of the dissertation opens with a brief overview of the most important dates in the development of hospitality industry in Zadar. Analysis of data is then presented on the percentages of nights of guests from the EU in Zadar in the last five years, which enables a comparison to be made in relation to the guests from the German speaking countries. The empirical analysis of the translations of culturemes into German was performed on the corpus of 30 menus from restaurants from Zadar’s city centre or Zadar's most frequent tourist neighborhoods. The empirical analysis encompasses the appearance, macrostructure, typographic features and additional information in the menus. What follows then is the analysis of the linguistic features in the menus, with regard to the structure of gastronomic names, the ratio of borrowings, foreign words and names with specific motivation. Verbs and adjectives are analyzed as well their role in carrying out the informative and <b>appellative</b> <b>functions</b> of the menu. The quality of the language in the translated menus is viewed with regard to errors at the semantic, grammatical and stylistic level, which is based on 894 individual items in total. The percentage is presented in a graph. The prominent point in the analysis is the review of the lack of information in the source texts - the fact that Croatian food culturemes appear without any additional information in the source text, which is a mitigating factor in the production of the functional target texts. The analysis of translation procedures of autochthonous Croatian culturemes into German then follows, which analyzes to what extent the translations into German in menus contribute to the realization of functional translations in accordance with the skopos theory framework. The empirical research carried out for this dissertation shows that the quality of language input in Croatian and German is exceptionally poor, which in itself is a clear indicator of the lack of knowledge about the functionalist theories in translatology. Anonymous translators in most cases provide literal translations, without taking into consideration the production of a functional translation. A functional translation should enable good reception and understanding of the text by the target speakers, but also highlight the items of heritage, so as to carry out the informative and <b>appellative</b> <b>functions</b> of the text by using adequate language. At the end of the dissertation an appendix is available with a list of food and meals, made on the basis of the names found in the menus in Zadar, expanded with names of the Dalmatian gastronomy culturemes, which are often found in practice. The list of meals and food presents a translation model which, in compliance with the tenets of the functionalist theories, may serve for concrete use in practice in catering and hospitality industry...|$|R
