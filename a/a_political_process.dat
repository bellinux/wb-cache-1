The federal parliament had notably amended the Constitution in order to create legal possibilities to condemn the party.

5|$|The Platine War {{ended in}} 1852 with the Allied {{victory at the}} Battle of Caseros, for some time {{establishing}} Brazilian hegemony over much of South America. The war ushered a period {{of economic and political}} stability in the Empire of Brazil. With Rosas gone, Argentina began <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>process</b> which would result in a more unified state. However, the end of the Platine war did not completely resolve issues within the Platine region. Turmoil continued in subsequent years, with internal disputes among political factions in Uruguay, a long civil war in Argentina, and an emergent Paraguay asserting its claims. Two more major international wars (see:Paraguayan War) followed during the next two decades, sparked by territorial ambitions and conflicts over influence.|$|E

Within this administrative framework a new provisional constitution was passed in August 2012, which reformed Somalia as a federation. Following the end of the TFG's interim mandate the same month, the Federal Government of Somalia, the first permanent central government in the country {{since the start of the}} civil war, was formed and a period of reconstruction began in Mogadishu.

500|$|The simple {{definition}} that sustainability {{is something that}} improves [...] "the quality of human life while living within the carrying capacity of supporting eco-systems", though vague, conveys the idea of sustainability having quantifiable limits. But sustainability is also a call to action, a task in progress or [...] "journey" [...] and therefore <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>process,</b> so some definitions set out common goals and values. The Earth Charter speaks of [...] "a sustainable global society founded on respect for nature, universal human rights, economic justice, and a culture of peace".

Massoud publicized their cause of [...] "popular consensus, general elections and democracy" [...] worldwide. At the same time he was very wary not to revive the failed Kabul government of the early 1990s.

He explained why he chose to write the book at this particular point, emphasizing it was to provide a guide for the public, and [...] "because impeachment is <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>process</b> that occurs outside of the courts. It is responsive to the people, and if impeachment is going to take place, it will be because the American people demand it."

[...] His speech concluded with reflections {{on the importance of}} political process in overcoming differences: [...] "How are fears born? They are born because of differences in tradition and history; they are born because of differences in emotional, political and national circumstances. Because of such differences, people fear they cannot live together. If we are to overcome such fear, a credible and healthy political process must be carefully and painfully developed. <b>A</b> <b>political</b> <b>process</b> that does not aim to change the other or to overcome differences, but that allows each side to live peacefully in spite of their differences." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{arguments}} {{presented in}} support of the unilateral declaration of independence cover five main aspects. The first is the presumption in international law that civil and human rights, including of minorities, should be protected, with the aim of demonstrating that these rights were abused by the then-governing Milošević administration. The second is the stress given in the appendices of documents such as UNSCR 1244 to <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>process</b> to determine final status, with the aim of demonstrating that such a process had been successfully concluded with the Kosovo Status Process. The third is that the references to the territorial integrity of Serbia are only in the preambular language and not in the operational language. The document is therefore silent as to what form the final status of Kosovo takes. The fourth is that the principle of territorial integrity constrains only other states, not domestic actors. [...] The fifth is that the right of self-determination, which the ICJ found to be jus cogens in the East Timor case, is a right of all peoples, not only of those in a colonial context.|$|E

2500|$|Corbyn {{has been}} vocal on Middle East foreign policy. He {{is a member}} of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, campaigning against {{conflict}} in Gaza and what the organisation considers to be [...] "apartheid in Israel". At a meeting hosted by Stop the War Coalition in 2009, Corbyn said he invited [...] "friends" [...] from Hamas and Hezbollah to an event in parliament, referred to Hamas as [...] "an organisation dedicated towards the good of the Palestinian people," [...] and said that the British government's labelling of Hamas as a terrorist organisation is [...] "a big, big historical mistake." [...] Asked on Channel 4 News in July 2015 why he had called representatives from Hamas and Hezbollah [...] "friends", Corbyn explained, [...] "I use it in a collective way, saying our friends are prepared to talk," [...] and that the specific occasion he used it was to introduce speakers from Hezbollah at a Parliamentary meeting about the Middle East. He said that he does not condone the actions of either organisation: [...] "Does it mean I agree with Hamas and what it does? No. Does it mean I agree with Hezbollah and what they do? No. What it means is that I think to bring about a peace process, you have to talk to people with whom you may profoundly disagree … There is not going to be a peace process unless there is talks involving Israel, Hezbollah and Hamas and I think everyone knows that", he argued. He has called for the lifting of sanctions as part of a negotiated full settlement of issues concerning the Iranian nuclear programme, and the starting of <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>process</b> to decommission Israel's nuclear arsenal.|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting on {{not just}} the {{situation}} in Tunisia and Egypt {{but also on the}} 2011 Yemeni protests, and the 2011 Jordanian protests, Clinton said at a February 5 meeting of the Quartet on the Middle East, [...] "The region is being battered by a perfect storm of powerful trends. ... This is what has driven demonstrators into the streets of ... cities throughout the region. The status quo is simply not sustainable." [...] She said that while transition to democracy could be chaotic – and free elections had to be accompanied by free speech, a free judiciary, {{and the rule of law}} in order to be effective – in the end [...] "free people govern themselves best". The transformations highlighted that traditional U.S. foreign policy in the region had sided with rulers who suppressed internal dissent but provided stability and generally supported U.S. goals in the region. When the monarchy's response to the 2011 Bahraini protests turned violent, Clinton urged a return to the path of reform, saying that violence against the protesters [...] "is absolutely unacceptable ... We very much want to see the human rights of the people protected, including right to assemble, right to express themselves, and we want to see reform." [...] At the same time, she said that the U.S. [...] "cannot tell countries what they are going to do [...] cannot dictate the outcomes." [...] As the situation in Bahrain lingered on and continued to have episodes of violence against protesters, Clinton said in mid-March, [...] "Our goal is a credible political process that can address the legitimate aspirations of all the people of Bahrain ... Violence is not and cannot be the answer. <b>A</b> <b>political</b> <b>process</b> is. We have raised our concerns about the current measures directly with Bahraini officials and will continue to do so." ...|$|E
