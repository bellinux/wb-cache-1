40|$|M Development and Management (Public Management and Governance), North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2014 The {{framework}} {{of this study}} is based on the reforms of human resource leave management in the field of public administration for the South African public sector. The researcher’s interest lies in the increasing complexity of leave management development pertaining to policy-making, administrative processes and efficiency in the South African public sector. This study aimed to assess leave management at the Department of Correctional Services (DCS) and the Department of Home Affairs (DHA). The DCS and DHA form part of the seven departments in the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security Cluster. The study aimed to assess the coping strategies of the two departments especially with the services rendered in a tight schedule and constraints. Furthermore, this study was also influenced by the findings of the investigations led by the Public Service Commission (PSC) which aimed to determine effectiveness of leave management in the South African Public Service. The objectives of this study were realised by means of a literature review and research instruments. The literature review was consulted to understand the context of leave management. This study applied the qualitative technique for reporting data. The interviews were used to ascertain the processes of managing leave whereby two sets of questionnaires were developed. The interviews posed the questions to the management of the DCS and DHA and the employees of the two departments. The management of annual leave entitlements is important to maintain the wellbeing of the employees, an organisation’s productivity and to help minimise associated financial implications incurred. The study found that the <b>accrual</b> <b>of</b> <b>leave</b> by public servants is a practice with significant financial implications for the state as employer. If leave is not managed and controlled effectively it can result in substantial losses in terms of unwarranted expenditure. The financial and other implications of leave prompted an investigation by the P S C aimed at determining how effective leave is managed in the Public Service. The study also found that reasonable measures were put in place for managing leave in the public sector. The office of the Health Risk Manager was developed to manage the process for approving the leave of absence as it relates to temporary incapacity leave, permanent incapacity leave and the occupational diseases. The empirical surveys conducted indicated that the two departments are well equipped for managing leave as they are required by labour law. The practices of planning, communication, control measures were also proven to be utilised in the two departments. The two departments render their services in a constrained manner, however the management has attempted to ensure that service delivery is not compromised when some of the members are on leave. Leave entitlements forms part of the accountability framework for the public sector especially when leave is attached to financial resources which are part of public money. In conclusion this study concludes that the public sector must consider the employee assisted systems for applying for leave. Such practices could also enhance the administrative backlogs encountered when recording leaves. Application of leave through such systems may also improve the productivity of the leave officers and reduce the cost of administrative resources. Master...|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to criticism regarding the financial information of nonprofit proprietary hospitals in Taiwan, the Taiwan Department of Health (February 2006) established {{standards for the}} financial reports of medical-juridical persons. These guidelines stipulate that such reports must be audited by {{a certified public accountant}} to verify that the reported earnings are representative. However, nonprofit proprietary hospitals continue to transfer hospital profits to individuals or corporate groups by using diverse measures, indicating that earnings figures may not reflect operational performance. Therefore, this study investigated nonprofit proprietary hospitals in Taiwan and applied the logistic regression method to examine earnings management (EM) behavior. The empirical results showed that the governance index exhibited a negative correlation with discretionary <b>accruals</b> <b>of</b> bad debt, discretionary <b>accruals</b> <b>of</b> the Jones model, and discretionary <b>accruals</b> <b>of</b> non-operating or non-revenue-generating activity. Nevertheless, discretionary items play an active role in EM.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address an often {{overlooked}} problem in defeasible argumentation: how do we deal with arguments that {{are on their own}} defeated, but together remain undefeated? Pollock (1991) finds this <b>accrual</b> <b>of</b> arguments a natural supposition, but then surprisingly denies its existence. We think that arguments do accrue. To handle the <b>accrual</b> <b>of</b> arguments, we introduce compound defeat of arguments. We call the defeat of arguments compound, if groups of arguments can be defeated by other groups of arguments. The formalism presented in this paper is based on this notion of compound defeat. It adequately handles the <b>accrual</b> <b>of</b> arguments. 1 INTRODUCTION Recently the formal study of defeasible argumentation has got much attention. Formalisms of defeasible argumentation are often distinguished from nonmonotonic logics in general. The principal distinction is that a notion of argument is central. In defeasible argumentation arguments can become defeated by other arguments. The main new e [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{adoption}} <b>of</b> <b>accrual</b> basis <b>of</b> accounting {{by governments}} {{is an important}} element to transform the bureaucratic administrative cash-based system to a more informative financial management system to ensure the supply of comprehensive, reliable, and meaningful financial information for appropriate accountability and decision making. Yemen is engaged in such reform, with advent of the E-Government, Information and Telecommunication Technologies era. This study describes the Yemen Central Government’s accounting and reporting system, its institutional framework, its policy characteristics and the environmental conditions that are in favour and unfavourable of such reform change. It also investigates the relationships between attitudes, innovative and organisational factors, {{as well as the}} adoption <b>of</b> <b>accrual</b> basis <b>of</b> accounting barriers and its implementation. Additionally, it investigates the moderating effects of E-Government between the abovementioned relationships during the face of change. This is to test if E-Government interaction will influence the strength and direction of the mentioned relationships in the model, and if the predictive power of that model would be increased. Finally, it examines the feasibility <b>of</b> <b>accrual</b> basis <b>of</b> accounting in Yemen. This study applied multiple theories, multi-method approaches (mixed-methods), and utilised qualitative and quantitative methodologies for data (analysis), collected from questionnaires and interview surveys. Twenty hypotheses are tested. The findings show that innovative and organisational factors have a positive relationship with an attitude toward change, while barriers have a negative relationship with an attitude toward change, but E-Government has a positive relationship with an attitude toward change. The results show that institutional frameworks such as the current Yemen governmental accounting and reporting framework, have an acceptable level <b>of</b> moving towards <b>accrual</b> basis <b>of</b> accounting, while accounting system objectives and reporting policy specifications reveal acceptable level of objectives and insufficient level of reporting policy. Even though the Yemen government officially announced the adoption <b>of</b> <b>accrual</b> basis <b>of</b> accounting and performed several alterations on the accounting system toward accrual basis, central government accounting officials are still using (modified) cash basis accounting. Computer integration, across governmental departments, is not complete. Environmental factors that contributed to change from cash basis to <b>accrual</b> basis <b>of</b> accounting are reform stimuli, pressures related to other reforms, and forces of globalisation. The contextual variables are in favour <b>of</b> moving toward <b>accrual</b> basis <b>of</b> accounting. Attitudes toward change were found to have a full mediation effect between innovation factors, organisational factors, barriers, and E-Government, emphasising the important role of accountants, financial managers, and others in the feasible adoption and implementation <b>of</b> <b>accrual</b> basis <b>of</b> accounting. E-Government shows a moderating effect on the relationships between all independent variables and the mediating variable of attitude toward change. This study found Government officials' attitude toward change from cash basis accounting to <b>accrual</b> basis <b>of</b> accounting to be very critical for the adoption and implementation of such change. Government financial officials have to be in line with the change process and their support is crucial for a successful adoption. E-Government (capabilities) is an important element in the success of the adoption and implementation <b>of</b> <b>accrual</b> basis <b>of</b> accounting...|$|R
