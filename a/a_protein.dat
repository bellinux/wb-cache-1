40|$|The {{half-life}} of the adenovirus 5 early region 1 A (E 1 <b>A)</b> <b>proteins</b> {{was examined}} in productively infected and transformed cells. In HeLa cells infected with adenovirus 5, the half-life of the E 1 <b>A</b> <b>proteins</b> was approximately 30 min; in the transformed 293 cells, the constitutively expressed E 1 <b>A</b> <b>proteins</b> had <b>a</b> half-life of approximately 120 min.

This {{difference in the}} stability of these two classes of E 1 <b>A</b> <b>proteins</b> helps explain why the steady-state level of the 12 S class is usually {{equal to or greater}} than that of the 13 S class, {{despite the fact that the}} concentration of the 13 S mRNA is about four times greater than the concentration of the 12 S mRNA...|$|R

40|$|A newly {{developed}} rat long-term {{bone marrow culture}} system was used to study the role of Pan/E 2 A basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors during B-cell development. In this system, B-lymphocyte progenitors actively differentiate into mature B cells. Monoclonal (Yae) and polyclonal (anti-Pan) antibodies were employed to characterize the expression of Pan proteins by Western blot assay during hematopoiesis and to examine the components of immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene enhancer element-binding species by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. During B-cell development, the appearance of Pan/E 2 <b>A</b> <b>proteins</b> preceded the expression of immunoglobulin heavy-chain <b>protein.</b> <b>A</b> Pan-containing immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer element (mu E 5) -binding species (BCF 1), composed of immunoreactive Pan- 1 /E 47 but not Pan- 2 /E 12, was observed concomitantly with the detection of Pan/E 2 <b>A</b> <b>proteins.</b> In addition to BCF 1, other mu E 5 -binding species were detected which were not recognized by the Yae antibody. Two of these species were present in primary B-lymphocyte and myeloid cultures and were recognized by an anti-upstream stimulatory factor antiserum. Although Pan/E 2 <b>A</b> <b>proteins</b> have been proposed to be ubiquitous, Pan/E 2 <b>A</b> <b>proteins</b> were not detected in primary myeloid cultures composed mainly of granulocytes and macrophages or in the macrophage cell line J 774.

We observed that many, but not all, functional domains identified in human adenovirus type 5 E 1 A are recognizably present in the other E 1 <b>A</b> <b>proteins.</b> Importantly, we identified highly conserved sequences without known activities or binding partners, suggesting that previously unrecognized determinants of E 1 A function remain to be uncovered.

40|$|E 2 <b>A</b> <b>proteins</b> {{regulate}} multiple {{stages of}} thymocyte development and suppress T-cell lymphoma. The activity of E 2 <b>A</b> <b>proteins</b> throughout thymocyte development is modulated by signals {{emanating from the}} pre-TCR and TCR. Here we demonstrate that E 2 A {{is required for the}} complete arrest in both differentiation and proliferation observed in thymocytes with defects in proteins that mediate pre-TCR signaling, including LAT, Lck and Fyn. We show that E 2 <b>A</b> <b>proteins</b> are required to prevent the accumulation of TCRÎ² negative cells beyond the pre-TCR checkpoint. E 2 A-deficient thymocytes also exhibit abnormal cell-cycle progression prior to pre-TCR expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that E 47 can act in concert with Bcl- 2 to induce cell-cycle arrest in vitro. These observations indicate that E 2 <b>A</b> <b>proteins</b> function during early thymocyte development to block cell-cycle progression prior to the expression of TCRÎ². In addition, these data provide further insight into how deficiencies in E 2 A lead to T lymphoma...|$|R

5|$|A linear {{chain of}} amino acid {{residues}} {{is called a}} polypeptide. <b>A</b> <b>protein</b> contains at least one long polypeptide. Short polypeptides, containing less than 20â€“30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides, or sometimes oligopeptides.

In the present study, the contribution of sequences in the nonconserved N-terminal region of the E 1 <b>A</b> <b>proteins</b> to morphological transformation and to down-regulation {{of a number of}} mitogen-inducible genes was investigated. As described previously, transformation of NRK cells (an established normal rat kidney cell line) results in denser cell growth and a cuboidal cellular morphology. None of the cells expressing N-terminally mutated E 1 <b>A</b> <b>proteins,</b> however, show these transformed properties, which suggests an important role for sequences in that domain. The decrease in cyclin D 1 levels requires exactly the same sequences. The ability to transform NRK cells and to reduce cyclin D 1 levels does not correlate with the presence in the E 1 <b>A</b> <b>proteins</b> of binding domains for p 300, CBP, p 107, pRb, cyclin A, or cdk 2.
