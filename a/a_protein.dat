40|$|The {{half-life}} of the adenovirus 5 early region 1 A (E 1 <b>A)</b> <b>proteins</b> {{was examined}} in productively infected and transformed cells. In HeLa cells infected with adenovirus 5, the half-life of the E 1 <b>A</b> <b>proteins</b> was approximately 30 min; in the transformed 293 cells, the constitutively expressed E 1 <b>A</b> <b>proteins</b> had <b>a</b> half-life of approximately 120 min. In HeLa cells, the E 1 <b>A</b> <b>proteins</b> produced by <b>an</b> adenovirus mutant that expresses only the 13 S mRNA had a half-life of about 35 min; E 1 <b>A</b> <b>proteins</b> produced by <b>a</b> mutant that express only the 12 S mRNA had a half-life of about 80 min. This {{difference in the}} stability of these two classes of E 1 <b>A</b> <b>proteins</b> helps explain why the steady-state level of the 12 S class is usually {{equal to or greater}} than that of the 13 S class, {{despite the fact that the}} concentration of the 13 S mRNA is about four times greater than the concentration of the 12 S mRNA...|$|R

40|$|A newly {{developed}} rat long-term {{bone marrow culture}} system was used to study the role of Pan/E 2 A basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors during B-cell development. In this system, B-lymphocyte progenitors actively differentiate into mature B cells. Monoclonal (Yae) and polyclonal (anti-Pan) antibodies were employed to characterize the expression of Pan proteins by Western blot assay during hematopoiesis and to examine the components of immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene enhancer element-binding species by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. During B-cell development, the appearance of Pan/E 2 <b>A</b> <b>proteins</b> preceded the expression of immunoglobulin heavy-chain <b>protein.</b> <b>A</b> Pan-containing immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer element (mu E 5) -binding species (BCF 1), composed of immunoreactive Pan- 1 /E 47 but not Pan- 2 /E 12, was observed concomitantly with the detection of Pan/E 2 <b>A</b> <b>proteins.</b> In addition to BCF 1, other mu E 5 -binding species were detected which were not recognized by the Yae antibody. Two of these species were present in primary B-lymphocyte and myeloid cultures and were recognized by an anti-upstream stimulatory factor antiserum. Although Pan/E 2 <b>A</b> <b>proteins</b> have been proposed to be ubiquitous, Pan/E 2 <b>A</b> <b>proteins</b> were not detected in primary myeloid cultures composed mainly of granulocytes and macrophages or in the macrophage cell line J 774.

We observed that many, but not all, functional domains identified in human adenovirus type 5 E 1 A are recognizably present in the other E 1 <b>A</b> <b>proteins.</b> Importantly, we identified highly conserved sequences without known activities or binding partners, suggesting that previously unrecognized determinants of E 1 A function remain to be uncovered.

40|$|E 2 <b>A</b> <b>proteins</b> {{regulate}} multiple {{stages of}} thymocyte development and suppress T-cell lymphoma. The activity of E 2 <b>A</b> <b>proteins</b> throughout thymocyte development is modulated by signals {{emanating from the}} pre-TCR and TCR. Here we demonstrate that E 2 A {{is required for the}} complete arrest in both differentiation and proliferation observed in thymocytes with defects in proteins that mediate pre-TCR signaling, including LAT, Lck and Fyn. We show that E 2 <b>A</b> <b>proteins</b> are required to prevent the accumulation of TCRβ negative cells beyond the pre-TCR checkpoint. E 2 A-deficient thymocytes also exhibit abnormal cell-cycle progression prior to pre-TCR expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that E 47 can act in concert with Bcl- 2 to induce cell-cycle arrest in vitro. These observations indicate that E 2 <b>A</b> <b>proteins</b> function during early thymocyte development to block cell-cycle progression prior to the expression of TCRβ. In addition, these data provide further insight into how deficiencies in E 2 A lead to T lymphoma...|$|R

5|$|A linear {{chain of}} amino acid {{residues}} {{is called a}} polypeptide. <b>A</b> <b>protein</b> contains at least one long polypeptide. Short polypeptides, containing less than 20–30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides, or sometimes oligopeptides.

In the present study, the contribution of sequences in the nonconserved N-terminal region of the E 1 <b>A</b> <b>proteins</b> to morphological transformation and to down-regulation {{of a number of}} mitogen-inducible genes was investigated. As described previously, transformation of NRK cells (an established normal rat kidney cell line) results in denser cell growth and a cuboidal cellular morphology. None of the cells expressing N-terminally mutated E 1 <b>A</b> <b>proteins,</b> however, show these transformed properties, which suggests an important role for sequences in that domain. The decrease in cyclin D 1 levels requires exactly the same sequences. The ability to transform NRK cells and to reduce cyclin D 1 levels does not correlate with the presence in the E 1 <b>A</b> <b>proteins</b> of binding domains for p 300, CBP, p 107, pRb, cyclin A, or cdk 2.
