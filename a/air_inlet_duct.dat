50|$|Rocket engines were {{selected}} {{due to their}} inherent compactness and light weight as well as {{eliminating the need for}} a large and destabilizing <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>duct.</b> The drawback to rocket engines is the large mass of fuel and oxidizer they require, and the potential for explosion. The amount of rocket propellant needed for RV-1 is minimized by keeping the size and weight of the vehicle as small as possible, while still storing enough energy on board to achieve the target speed. RV-1 will have a capacity for approximately 4,200 lbs combined weight of liquid oxygen (LOX) and kerosene. This will be sufficient to support a continuous thrust of 35,000 lbs for a minimum of 30 seconds or 50,000 lbs for a minimum of 17 seconds. The thrust will be variable {{so that it can be}} tailored to match the planned trajectory for each run. Trajectories will be plotted based on drag curves calculated through detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. To avoid the mechanical complexity of a pump-fed system, a blowdown system will be used with nitrogen pressurizing the LOX and kerosene tanks. The explosion hazard is minimized by placement of the LOX and kerosene tanks in separate compartments, divided by bulkheads and further separated with the cockpit and the nitrogen tanks.|$|E

40|$|Wet {{compression}} cooling {{has become}} an extremely important gas cooling method for land based power generation installations. The {{reason for this is}} that many power stations are augmenting their standard power generation units with turbines. These turbines are generally used to help supply electricity during peak power occurrences, particularly during the summer months in many geographic areas. One of the main reasons for cooling this air is to increase the density as well to facilitate a cooler combustor inlet temperature. The increase in compressor air inlet density increases the overall compressor efficiency. An increase in combustor efficiency will also occur due to the lower combustor inlet air temperature. The general method for this inlet air-cooling is to use finely atomized drops in the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> leading to the turbine compressor. If the drops are of the appropriate size and atmospheric conditions are favorable (i. e. wet bulb temperature), the water will begin to evaporate prior to reaching the first compressor stage. In some instances the evaporation may be allowed to continue into the compressor itself. This can create some difficulties if the atomizers are not operating correctly. Large drops can impact the rotor blades of the compressor and can wear the compressor blades through erosion over time. It is also optimal to maintain a fairly tight drop size distribution from the atomizer. This facilitates a mor...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe U. S. Navy's concern with steam-induced jet engine stall {{has become more}} pertinent {{with the introduction of}} the F- 35 C. During take offs on aircraft carriers, steam from aging catapult systems can potentially seep onto the flight deck. When ingested into jet engines, this steam may increase the engines' susceptibility to stall. The serpentine <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>ducts</b> and single engine of the F- 35 C could make it especially vulnerable to this steam-induced stall during takeoff. To better understand and predict steam-induced stall, this study created a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of steam-induced stall on a single blade passage of a compressor rotor. A single blade passage of the transonic Sanger rotor was generated using computer modeling software. This model was then used in the ANSYS CFX computational fluid dynamics program to simulate steady-state and steam ingestion operations at 95 % and 100 % rotor design speeds. These CFD simulations generated compressor maps and throttle and steam-induced stall points. The CFD results were then compared to results from throttle-induced stall and steam-induced stall experiments conducted on the Sanger rotor in the transonic compressor rig. This study verified that CFD can estimate steam-induced stall operating margin reduction. Outstanding ThesisUS Navy (USN) author...|$|R

The objectives of the workshop were to discuss and compare the merits of existing Rocket-Based Combined Cycle (RBCC) engine cycle codes being used by government and industry to predict RBCC engine performance and interpret experimental results. These merits included physical and chemical modeling, accuracy and user friendliness. The ultimate purpose of the workshop was to identify the best codes for analyzing RBCC engines and to document any potential shortcomings, not to demonstrate the merits or deficiencies of any particular engine design. Five cases representative of the operating regimes of typical RBCC engines were {{used as the basis}} of these comparisons. These included Mach 0 sea level static and Mach 1. 0 and Mach 2. 5 Air-Augmented-Rocket (AAR), Mach 4 subsonic combustion ramjet or dual-mode scramjet, and Mach 8 scramjet operating modes. Specification of a generic RBCC engine geometry and concomitant component operating efficiencies, bypass ratios, fuel/oxidizer/air equivalence ratios and flight dynamic pressures were provided.
