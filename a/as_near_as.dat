Despite the firepower, the Māori suffered no casualties and abandoned the pā that night. Though it was small—about 650 square yards—the pā had been situated {{so that it was}} difficult to surround completely and had also been built with covered trenches and 10 anti-artillery bunkers, roofed with timber and earth, that protected its garrison.|$|E
25|$|A chimney is a {{structure}} that provides ventilation for hot flue gases or smoke from a boiler, stove, furnace or fireplace to the outside atmosphere. Chimneys are typically vertical, or <b>as</b> <b>near</b> <b>as</b> possible to vertical, {{to ensure that the}} gases flow smoothly, drawing air into the combustion in {{what is known as the}} stack, or chimney effect. The space inside a chimney is called a flue. Chimneys may be found in buildings, steam locomotives and ships. In the United States, the term smokestack (colloquially, stack) is also used when referring to locomotive chimneys or ship chimneys, and the term funnel can also be used.|$|E

25|$|The Hall of Fame... {{owes its}} {{inception}} {{in large part to}} hard facts of physical geography. After the three buildings which were to form {{the west side of the}} quadrangle of the New York University College of Arts and Science at University Heights had been planned, it was decided, in order to enlarge the quadrangle, to push them <b>as</b> <b>near</b> <b>as</b> possible to the avenue above the Harlem River. But since the campus level is 170 feet above high tide, and from 40 to 60 feet above the avenue, it was seen at once that the basement stories would stand out towards the avenue bare and unsightly. In order to conceal their walls, a terrace was suggested by the architect, to be bounded at its outer edge by a parapet or colonnade.|$|E
25|$|In 1885 a {{programme}} {{of annual}} naval manoeuvres had begun, where the British navy would divide into opposing fleets and conduct war exercises <b>as</b> <b>near</b> <b>as</b> possible to real conditions {{which might be}} experienced. By 1888 this had {{become a source of}} great interest to the public and the navy alike. The navy encouraged attention, allowing reporters on board during manoeuvres, believing that the publicity furthered their campaigns for greater funding. That year, the intention was to test the practicality of blockading an enemy fleet in its home ports when the ships concerned were modern iron and steam vessels rather than traditional sailing ships. The idea was that a superior fleet, taking the role of the British, would surprise an inferior enemy force before it could sail from two home ports.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} time in modern Republican Party history, three {{different}} candidates won the first three state contests in January (the Iowa caucuses, the New Hampshire primary, and the South Carolina primary). Although Romney had been expected to win in at least Iowa and New Hampshire, Rick Santorum won the non-binding poll at caucus sites in Iowa by 34 votes, <b>as</b> <b>near</b> <b>as</b> can be determined from the incomplete tally, earning him a declaration as winner by state party leaders, although vote totals were missing from eight precincts. The election of county delegates at the caucuses would eventually lead to Ron Paul earning 22 of the 28 Iowa delegates to the Republican National Convention. Newt Gingrich won South Carolina by a surprisingly large margin, and Romney won only in New Hampshire.|$|E
25|$|Orders for {{the fleet}} at Tynemouth were given on 28 April. All the ships {{were to be}} ready to weigh anchor at a {{favourable}} wind. The Lord Admiral, Viscount Lisle's flagship would fly the St George Cross on the fore-top mast and two top-lights at night. The ships of the 'vaward', the vanguard, would follow and anchor <b>as</b> <b>near</b> <b>as</b> possible. Hertford and the treasure-ship (Ralph Sadler was treasurer) would follow with his ensign on the main-top mast of the Rose Lion with two night lights on the shrouds. The Earl of Shrewsbury, captain of the rear-ward would fly the ensign on his mizzen mast, with a cresset light in the poop deck at night. The other ships were not to show flags or lights. Any ship that was transporting base or double base guns was to mount them on the fore-deck for the landing.|$|E
25|$|On 1 March 1801, some 70 British {{warships}} {{under the}} command of Admiral Lord Keith, Cameleon among them, together with transports carrying 16,000 troops, anchored in Abu Qir Bay near Alexandria. The objective of the operation was the defeat of the French expeditionary force that had remained in Egypt after Napoleon's return to France. Bad weather delayed disembarkation by a week but, on 8 March, Captain Alexander Cochrane of HMS Ajax gave the signal and deployed 320 boats, in double line abreast, to bring the troops ashore. French shore batteries opposed the landing, but the British were able to drive them back. During the landing Cameleon was anchored <b>as</b> <b>near</b> <b>as</b> possible with her broadside to the shore, and suffered one seaman wounded in the operation. By the next day, all of Sir Ralph Abercromby's British army was ashore. The British then defeated the French army at the Battle of Alexandria. The Siege of Alexandria followed, with the city falling on 2 September 1801.|$|E

500|$|In January 2008 Bob Bindschadler (NASA) {{landed on}} the {{floating}} ice shelf of PIG, this is at the downstream end where it floats on the sea. This landing, by a Twin Otter plane fitted with skis, was the first ever landing on this ice shelf. The reason for landing on the ice shelf was for a reconnaissance mission to investigate the feasibility of drilling through around [...] of ice, to lower instruments into the ocean cavity below. It is hoped that this will provide important information on {{the link between the}} ocean and Pine Island Glacier. It was decided that the small crevasse free area was too hard for further landings and so further fieldwork had to be postponed. Therefore, two GPS units and a weather station were positioned <b>as</b> <b>near</b> <b>as</b> possible to PIG.|$|E

500|$|Hobbs' {{technique}} {{was based on}} strong forearms and good foot movement. R. C. Robertson-Glasgow suggested that [...] "his footwork was, <b>as</b> <b>near</b> <b>as</b> is humanly possible, perfect. In every stroke, he moved into line with the ball with so little effort that he could bat for hours without over-taxing energy of mind or body." [...] He played every type of shot—he {{did not have a}} [...] "signature" [...] shot like other batsmen, but selected his strokes effectively; according to Alec Kennedy, who bowled to Hobbs, it seemed that he could predict what the bowler would do. In contrast to many leading batsmen from his time, Hobbs preferred to play off the back foot as he believed it gave him more time to see the ball and adapt his shot. Capable of playing all the strokes, he hit the ball precisely between fielders and sometimes delayed his shot to make the ball travel more slowly and allow more time to run; he also ran well between the wickets. He liked to score his first run quickly when he came into bat, and he often looked to score quickly at the start of an innings, before the bowlers had settled; on occasion, Hobbs targeted the main bowling threats from the opposition in an attempt to neutralise them. Early in his career, mainly before the First World War, Hobbs was an aggressive, fast-scoring batsman who played many shots. After the war, he was more circumspect and adapted his technique to account for both his increased age, and the increased pressure and expectation from the public and teammates. He concentrated to a greater extent on batting for longer periods; many critics, including Hobbs himself, recognised the change and suggested that he was a better batsman before 1914. However, commentators also noted that he displayed greater certainty and control in this later period; Cardus wrote that [...] "he scored his centuries effortlessly now; we hardly noted the making of them." [...] This was the period in which he became known as [...] "The Master", and he was more consistent than before the war. This was the time when the public regarded him with the most respect and affection; [...] 98 of his centuries and 26,411 of his runs (at an average of 58.62) in first-class cricket were scored after he reached the age of 40.|$|E
