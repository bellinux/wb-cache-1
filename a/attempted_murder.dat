5|$|Conversely, {{there are}} no records of a {{large-scale}} Greek slave revolt {{comparable to that of}} Spartacus in Rome. It can probably be explained by the relative dispersion of Greek slaves, which would have prevented any large-scale planning. Slave revolts were rare, even in Rome. Individual acts of rebellion of slaves against their master, though scarce, are not unheard of; a judicial speech mentions the <b>attempted</b> <b>murder</b> of his master by a boy slave, not 12 years old.|$|E

The film ends with the assertion that only Jesus can completely heal people from the horrors of sexual slavery.|$|E
5000|$|Of {{the seven}} <b>murders</b> and three <b>attempted</b> <b>murders</b> finally {{attributed}} to De Berk by the court, the court considered {{two of them}} to be proven by medical evidence. According to the court, De Berk had poisoned these two patients. The court then applied a so-called chaining-evidence argument. This means that if the several <b>attempted</b> or actual <b>murders</b> have already been established beyond reasonable doubt, then much weaker evidence than normal is sufficient to establish that a subsequent eight [...] "suspicious incidents" [...] are <b>murders</b> or <b>attempted</b> <b>murders</b> carried out by the same defendant.|$|R

The case impacted upon British firearms policy, especially the manner in which regional police forces communicate over firearm ownership.|$|E

5|$|Farrell was {{inspired}} to try acting when Henry Thomas' performance in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial moved him to tears.

As an 18-year-old travelling in Sydney, he was at one time suspected for <b>attempted</b> <b>murder.</b> The police sketch looked remarkably like him and he had even described blacking out during the night in question. His only alibi was apparently a journal kept by his friend that explained the two had been across town that night, taking MDMA.|$|E
