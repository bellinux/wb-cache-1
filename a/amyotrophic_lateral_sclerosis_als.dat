5|$|In {{addition}} to immediate health effects, some injuries sustained during a player's career can have effects that extend to their post-career life. A cohort mortality study {{by researchers at}} the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) examined 3,349 NFL players who played at least five full seasons from 1959 to 1988. The findings from this study suggest that, in comparison to the typical American male, NFL players live longer on average but have around three times the risk of death associated with neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, the risk of death from Alzheimer's disease and <b>Amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> (<b>ALS)</b> was roughly four times higher among former players than the average American male. The study also compared mortality risks from speed players (quarterbacks, running backs, fullbacks, wide receivers, tight ends, linebackers, cornerbacks, and safeties) and nonspeed players (offensive and defensive linemen), with findings indicating that a greater number of deaths were attributable to neurodegenerative disorders in speed players than nonspeed players.

30|$|P 62, {{also known}} as sequestosome 1, is a shuttle protein {{transporting}} polyubiquitinated proteins for both the proteasomal and autophagy/lysosomal dependent degradation (Komatsu et al., 2007; Pankiv et al., 2007; Seibenhener et al., 2004; Wooten et al., 2008). P 62 and ubiquitinated proteins are conserved markers of neuronal aging, aggregate formation and progressive autophagic defects (Bartlett et al., 2011). In particular, p 62 was commonly detected in ubiquitinated protein aggregates in neuronal diseases including LBs in PD, neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington aggregates in Huntington’s disease, and skein-like inclusions in <b>amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> (Lowe et <b>al.,</b> 1988; Rue et al., 2013; Seibenhener et al., 2004; Zatloukal et al., 2002). P 62 shuttles misfolded proteins to the aggresome and autophagosome (Bjorkoy et al., 2006; Kirkin et al., 2009; Pankiv et al., 2010). Mutations in p 62 have been linked with the occurrence of familial and sporadic <b>amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> (Fecto et <b>al.,</b> 2011; Rubino et al., 2012). Furthermore, knockout of the p 62 protein alone leads to neuropathological lesions including the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic deficiencies with loss of working memory and neuronal apoptosis (Babu et al., 2005; Wooten et al., 2008). It is thus crucial to maintain a homeostatic level of p 62 for normal cellular functions. Dysregulation of p 62 {{could result in the}} perturbation of cell signaling and accumulation of damaging protein aggregates, leading to neuronal loss and pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. In an effort to understand whether and how parkin deficiency leads to the dysregulated mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial quality, we were interested to find that p 62 is a new substrate of parkin and p 62 is selectively accumulated in dopamingeric neuronal cells in parkin deficient mice. Our results showed that parkin plays a critical role for regulating p 62 stability and implied that dysregulation of parkin/p 62 axis could account for the selective vulnerability during pathogenesis of PD.|$|R
5|$|Several {{experimental}} and clinical {{studies have indicated}} that aberrations and deregulations of the UPS contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative and myodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Pick's disease, <b>Amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> (<b>ALS),</b> Huntington's disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, and motor neuron diseases, polyglutamine (PolyQ) diseases, Muscular dystrophies and several rare forms of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia. As part of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), the proteasome maintains cardiac protein homeostasis and thus plays a significant role in cardiac Ischemic injury, ventricular hypertrophy and Heart failure. Additionally, evidence is accumulating that the UPS plays an essential role in malignant transformation. UPS proteolysis {{plays a major role in}} responses of cancer cells to stimulatory signals that are critical for the development of cancer. Accordingly, gene expression by degradation of transcription factors, such as p53, c-Jun, c-Fos, NF-κB, c-Myc, HIF-1α, MATα2, STAT3, sterol-regulated element-binding proteins and androgen receptors are all controlled by the UPS and thus involved in the development of various malignancies. Moreover, the UPS regulates the degradation of tumor suppressor gene products such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) in colorectal cancer, retinoblastoma (Rb). and von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL), as well as a number of proto-oncogenes (Raf, Myc, Myb, Rel, Src, Mos, Abl). The UPS is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. This activity is usually attributed to the role of proteasomes in the activation of NF-κB which further regulates the expression of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-β, IL-8, adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P selectine) and prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO). Additionally, the UPS also plays a role in inflammatory responses as regulators of leukocyte proliferation, mainly through proteolysis of cyclines and the degradation of CDK inhibitors. Lastly, autoimmune disease patients with SLE, Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) predominantly exhibit circulating proteasomes which can be applied as clinical biomarkers.|$|E

40|$|Ubiquitin (Ub), {{a protein}} {{consisting}} of 76 amino acid residues which {{is present in}} all eukaryotic cells tested (Rechsteiner, 1987), {{plays a role in}} the degradation of abnormal and short-lived proteins by the ATP- and Ub-dependent proteolytic systems (Hershko et al., 1980). Ubiquitination of histone 2 A varies {{during the course of the}} cell cycle (Matsui et al., 1979). Accumulation of Ub has been shown immunohistochemically in intracellular inclusions in several diseases, including neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease, Lewy bodies of Parkinson's disease, Pick bodies of Pick's disease, Rosenthal fibres within astrocytes, Mallory bodies of alcoholic liver disease, and Lewy body-like hyaline inclusions of familial <b>amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> (Mori et <b>al.,</b> 1987; Perry et al., 1987; Lowe et al., 1988; Murayama et al., 1989). Ub has been considered to play a role in pathological processes of these diseases. Recently, Galloway and Likavec (1989) have shown the existence of intense Ub immunoreactivity in perikarya of neoplastic astrocytes but not in normal astrocytes.

40|$|It has {{historically}} been debated whether in-flammation plays {{an active role in}} Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis or is ancillary to other AD pathologies (Wyss-Coray, 2006). How-ever, recent genome-wide association studies linked polymorphisms in inflammation-related genes to increased AD risk, supporting the con-clusion that inflammation can be a causative factor in disease pathology (Karch and Goate, 2015). Notably, variants of the immune cell– specific triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM 2) confer dramatically elevated risk for developing AD (R. Guerreiro et al., 2013; Jonsson et al., 2013). TREM 2 variants are also the genetic basis of Nasu-Hakola disease (Bird et al., 1983) and confer increased risk for fron-totemporal dementia (FTD; R. J. Guerreiro et al., 2013), Parkinson’s disease (Rayaprolu et <b>al.,</b> 2013), and <b>amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> (Cady et <b>al.,</b> 2014). These data suggest that TREM 2 may serve a common function that modifies risk for neurodegenerative disorders. TREM 2 is an important modulator of immune cell function. In the brain, the TREM 2 receptor is expressed exclusively by myeloid cells (Colonna, 2003). TREM 2, along with its obligate intracellular adaptor DAP 12, was identified as a hub gene in systems biology analyses in AD (Forabosco et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013), highlighting the central impor-tance of these myeloid cell signaling element...|$|R
40|$|Transport of {{cellular}} and neuronal vesicles, organelles, and other particles along microtubules requires the molecular motor protein dynein (Mallik and Gross, 2004). Critical to dynein function is dynactin, a multiprotein complex commonly {{thought to be}} required for dynein attachment to membrane compartments (Karki and Holzbaur, 1999). Recent work also has found that mutations in dynactin can cause the human motor neuron disease <b>amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> (Puls et <b>al.,</b> 2003). Thus, {{it is essential to}} understand the in vivo function of dynactin. To test directly and rigorously the hypothesis that dynactin is required to attach dynein to membranes, we used both a Drosophila mutant and RNA interference to generate organisms and cells lacking the critical dynactin subunit, actin-related protein 1. Contrary to expectation, we found that apparently normal amounts of dynein associate with membrane compartments {{in the absence of a}} fully assembled dynactin complex. In addition, anterograde and retrograde organelle movement in dynactin deficient axons was completely disrupted, resulting in substantial changes in vesicle kinematic properties. Although effects on retrograde transport are predicted by the proposed function of dynactin as a regulator of dynein processivity, the additional effects we observed on anterograde transport also suggest potential roles for dynactin in mediating kinesin-driven transport and in coordinating the activity of opposing motors (King and Schroer, 2000) ...|$|R

40|$|Microglia are the {{resident}} myeloid phagocytes {{of the central}} nervous system (CNS), where they fulfill important functions in normal phys-iology and in the response to injury or disease (Saijo and Glass, 2011). Activated microglia, which are a hallmark of neuroinflammation, may contribute to CNS damage and chronic neurodegeneration through the release of harm-ful cytokines, reactive oxygen species, or un-controlled phagocytosis (Lucin and Wyss-Coray, 2009). For example, microglia contribute to neu-rodegeneration in superoxide dismutase 1 trans-genic mouse models for <b>amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> (Boillée et <b>al.,</b> 2006), and microglia lacking fractalkine receptor, CX 3 CR 1, promote protein aggregation and disease in tau trans-genic models of Alzheimer’s disease and related tauopathies (Bhaskar et al., 2010). Interestingly, microglial activation appears indicative of disease activity in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients based on positron emission tomography (PET) imag-ing with a ligand that binds to peripheral ben-zodiazepine receptors on activated microglia (Banati et al., 2000). These observations raise the possibility that selective inhibition of microglia may be beneficial in certain CNS disorders with a neuroinflammatory component, but today no treatments targeting aberrantly activated mi-croglia are available to test this hypothesis.

40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> is {{a rapidly}} progressive, fatal {{neurodegenerative}} disorder {{for which there}} is no effective treatment. The diagnosis is dependent on the clinical presentation and consistent electrodiagnostic studies. Typically, there is a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs as well as electrodiagnostic studies indicative of diffuse motor axonal injury. The presentation of <b>amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis,</b> however, may be variable. At the same time, the diagnosis is essential for patient prognosis and management. It is therefore important to appreciate the range of possible presentations of <b>amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> Case presentation We present the case of a 57 -year-old Caucasian man with pathological findings on postmortem examination consistent with <b>amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> but atypical clinical and electrodiagnostic features. He died after a rapid course of progressive weakness. The patient did not respond to immunosuppressive therapy. Conclusion <b>Amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> should be considered in patients with a rapidly progressive, unexplained neuropathic process. This should be true even if there are atypical clinical and electrodiagnostic findings. Absence of response to therapy and the development of upper motor neuron signs should reinforce the possibility that <b>amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> may be present. Since <b>amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> is a fatal illness, however, the possibility of this disease in patients with atypical clinical features should not diminish the need for a thorough diagnostic evaluation and treatment trials. </p...|$|R

A prevailing theme among these mutants seems to be dysfunction of the neuronal mitochondria and an increasing inability to deal with oxidative stress, which manifests as lipid droplets.|$|E
50|$|In a study {{conducted}} by Kihira et al., eight individuals with <b>amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> were compared to nine control cases. The results indicated that the total number of neurons in Onuf’s nucleus in patients with <b>amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> did not differ from the control patients. However, normal neurons decreased in number while atrophic neurons increased. It was also shown that the {{decrease in the number of}} normal neurons was not due to aging. Patients with <b>amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> also contain less RNA in their motoneurons than normal individuals. The decrease in RNA is correlated with the decrease in size of the nucleolus. Thus, the size of the nucleolus may be an early indicator of <b>amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis.</b>|$|R
40|$|Rapid and {{efficient}} uptake of glutamate via the high-affinity glutamate transporter EAAT 2 {{is important for}} limiting glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity involved in neuronal death. Furthermore, {{there is evidence of}} altered glutamate uptake and catabolism in motor neuron diseases. Such a defect has been reported in <b>amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis,</b> the major motor neuron disease, and was associated with impairment in EAAT 2 processing. We recently reported the presence of enterovirus genome specifically in the anterior horn of <b>amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> cases, suggesting the involvement of a chronic/persistent enterovirus infection in <b>amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> To investigate a putative link between enterovirus infection and the glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity observed in <b>amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis,</b> we developed an in vitro model consisting of a human glial cell line infected with ECHOvirus 6, one of the enteroviruses with sequences closely related to those detected in patients with <b>amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> In these glial cells, an ECHOvirus 6 chronic infection was established, resulting in altered extracellular glutamate uptake. This correlated with an aberrant splicing of the EAAT 2 pre-messenger ribonucleic acid and a significant loss of EAAT 2 protein expression, similar to that observed in patients with <b>amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> These results provide convincing evidence that an enterovirus chronic/persistent infection may alter glial glutamate uptake and catabolism. As enteroviruses are extremely common human pathogens, they may act as a trigger in the development of certain motor neuron diseases, such as <b>amyotrophic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis...</b>|$|R
