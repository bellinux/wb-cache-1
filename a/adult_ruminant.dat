40|$|Abstract: Ruminant {{animals have}} a great {{advantage}} over simple-stomached animals, as their digestive process is able to release the energy contained in cellulosic material through carbohydrate fermentation by microorganisms enzymes from the rumen environment. However, carbohydrate fermentation results not only in short chain fatty acids (SCFA) but also in less desirable products such as heat, as well as methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) gases which represents energy loss for the animal estimated in 2 to 12 % of gross energy from feed (Johnson and Johnson, 1995). As an <b>adult</b> <b>ruminant</b> can produce up to 17 liters of methane per hour and this gas cannot be metabolized even by rumen microorganisms, {{most of it is}} removed from rumen by expiration or eructation (Moss, 1993), and released in the environment. There are different techniques for methane emissions measurements by ruminants in production conditions; among them there is one that uses an inert gas tracer, sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6). This technique results in a precise estimative of methane production by the animal besides enabling the evaluation of animals in normal pasture conditions, it consists in placing a permeation tube, which releases SF 6 at a previously known rate in the rumen, where by the contractions of this organ, CH 4 and SF 6 gases are released by eructation and samples are collected close to mouth and nostrils. This method assumes that the standard of SF 6 emission simulates the standard of CH 4 emission. The flow of CH 4 released by the animal is calculated in relation to SF 6 flow (Westberg et al., 1998). The objective with {{the present study was to}} evaluate energy sources inclusion in cattle diets on methane production determined by sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) tracer gas technique. 201...|$|E
40|$|ATP-citrate lyase (ACL) {{is one of}} {{the major}} lipogenic enzymes. It catalyzes the {{synthesis}} of acetyl-CoA from citrate in the cytosol. This is the first committed step towards the conversion of carbohydrate precursors into fatty acids. Acetyl-CoA serves as the major precursor for lipogenesis and cholestogenesis. Examination of this pathway shows that the rate of fatty acid synthesis from glucose is dependent on the activity of ACL. In rats the activity of this enzyme can be increased by feeding high carbohydrate diet and reduced to low levels by fasting. These changes are regulated at the transcriptional level. The ruminant provides a good model to study the regulation of expression of ACL. The levels of this enzyme are high in young ruminants, but fall to very low levels once a functional rumen is developed. In adult ruminants, acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis is produced directly from acetate formed by microbial fermentation in the rumen and carried to the peripheral tissues. The down-regulation of this enzyme can be reversed by the administration of glucogenic precursors by a route that bypasses their fermentation to volatile fatty acids in the rumen. An understanding of the regulation of expression of ACL in the <b>adult</b> <b>ruminant</b> and a comparison with monogastric animals will provide significant new information about the regulation of the conversion of carbohydrate into fat. A probe containing exon 2 to exon 3 of the rat ACL gene was prepared. Its specificity to bovine genomic DNA was verified and the probe was then used to screen a bovine λ genomic library. A 17 kb clone was isolated. The restriction map of this clone was determined with several enzymes. A part of this clone (9490 base pairs) was sequenced and shown to consist of a 3 kb promoter region and doenstream seqence as far as intron 3 of bovine ACL.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{a study of}} the {{physical}} and functional development of the forestomachs of the lamb is presented. The experimental work can be divided into three main fields as follows:- a) Studies on the physical development of the fore- stomachs. b) Studies on the functional development of the reticule-rumen. a) Field work in which the above studies have some direct bearing. The main findings of these studies have a) PhysicaI development of the forestomachs: In grazing lefts the four stomachs have reached their adult proportions by approximately 8 weeks of age. The type of diet can markedly influence the rate of growth of the forestomachs, and in general, it would appear that plant food is needed for the normal development of the forestomachs, and It plant food is excluded from the diet the development of the forestomachs is retarded at about the level found in the 3 week old grazing lamb. The main changes in the histology of the forestomach walls takes place during the last third of foetal life, and the adult his histological features are all present at birth. The major post-natal histological changes are complete by 56 days of age. It would appear that age is the main factor controlling the histological development of the forestomachs, and that plant material is necessary for the full development It of these organs. It was also shown that different diets can cause differences in the appearance of the rumen mucosal surface, stratum granulosum and stratum corneum. b) Funcational development of the reticulo-rumen: It was postulated that the functional development of the reticulo-rumen of the grazing iamb could be divided into three phases - a non ruminant phase (0 - 3 weeks of age), a transition phase (3 - 8 weeks of age) and an <b>adult</b> <b>ruminant</b> phase (8 weeks of age onwards). If plant food was excluded from the diet, the lamb remained in the non- ruminant phase, however, once plant food was fed to these lambs the reticule-rumen function reached the adult levels within one week. c) Field studies: As the forestomachs of the grazing are qualitatively and quantitatively fully developed by approximately 8 weeks of age, it is possible to ween lambs of this age with no check to their growth rate, provided the pastures are relatively high in protein and are not at the late flowering or seeding stages. The milk yield of the grazing ewe measured by the oxytocin technique gave consistently higher recordings throughout Iactation than the conventional lamb suckling technique. By the tenth week of the lactation the milk yield, as measured by both techniques, had fallen by half. There was a high correlation between the milk yield of the ewe and the lamb live weight growth up to seven weeks of age. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Intensive {{livestock}} production and management systems {{are associated with}} increased faecal-oral pathogen transmission which can contribute to a high prevalence of multiple Salmonella serovars in large dairy farms and feedlots. Outbreaks of salmonellosis in livestock often reflect {{a series of events}} that compromise host immunity and increase pathogen exposure. High risk groups in cattle include neonates and post partum cows (Anderson, et al., 2001; House, et al., 2001 a; Fossler, et al., 2005 a) and variation in susceptibility to salmonella infection has been observed in sheep entering feedlots according to property of origin, body condition, and time of year (Norris, et al., 1989 a; Norris, et al., 1989 b; Richards and Hyder, 1991; Kelly, 1995; Makin, 2011). The associated increase in the incidence of disease and contamination of livestock-derived food products imposes a significant risk to food safety via consumption of contaminated meat, milk, eggs and vegetables. The development and application of effective Salmonella vaccines offers a potential means of reducing industry associated losses and public health risks. Effective Salmonella vaccination therefore requires induction of protection against several Salmonella serovars and stimulation of both innate and acquired immune mechanisms. Vaccine prophylaxis is normally achieved through vaccinating animals several weeks prior to virulent pathogen exposure. This is not possible in neonates where exposure occurs at birth and in feedlots where livestock are sourced from diverse locations and vendors. Additionally, direct physical handling of livestock to administer vaccines contributes to stress and may lead to carcass damage. Conducting stressful procedures at feedlot induction when there is concurrent exposure to a diversity of pathogens contributes to an increased risk of disease. iii Traditional vaccination methods are labour intensive and associated with carcass damage and adverse reactions. Oral delivery of vaccines and medications via drinking water is a common practice in intensively managed poultry. Oral vaccine delivery via drinking water avoids the stress of additional handling and provides a means of rapidly vaccinating large numbers of animals. The efficacy of Salmonella vaccination is largely influenced by the diversity of Salmonella serovars encountered and the interval between immunisation and pathogen exposure, which may be short in field settings, e. g., following birth, during transport and following introduction into feedlots. The timing of virulent pathogen exposure may also {{have an impact on the}} safety of a Salmonella vaccine. It is imperative to develop livestock vaccines that are capable of safely eliciting potent states of cross-protective immunity against a diversity of serovars. This thesis examines the capacity of the dam S. Typhimurium vaccine (serogroup B) to elicit cross-protection against a virulent challenge in models of neonate and <b>adult</b> <b>ruminant</b> models of salmonellosis, as well as investigating in-water vaccine delivery. Cross-protective efficacy of the vaccine was evaluated against an emerging, clinically relevant, and multi-drug resistant strain of serovar Newport (serogroup C 2 -C 3) that had been associated with clinical disease in calves and humans (CDC, 2002; Clark, 2004). Vaccinated calves challenged with S. Newport exhibited a significant attenuation of clinical disease and a concomitant reduction in S. Newport faecal shedding and colonisation of mesenteric lymph nodes and lungs compared to non-vaccinated control animals. The safety and efficacy of a S. Typhimurium dam vaccine in adult sheep was demonstrated via novel oral delivery in drinking water (ad libitum). The capacity of S. Typhimurium dam vaccine to be delivered in drinking water to protect livestock from virulent Salmonella challenge offers an effective, economical, stressor free Salmonella prophylaxis for intensive {{livestock production}} systems...|$|E

40|$|Background: Schmallenberg virus (SBV) is an {{emerging}} Orthobunyavirus of ruminant livestock species currently circulating in Europe. SBV causes a subclinical or mild disease in adult animals but vertical transmission to pregnant dams {{may lead to}} severe malformations in the offspring. Data on the onset of clinical signs, viremia and seroconversion in experimentally infected adult animals are available for cattle and sheep but are still lacking for goats. For {{a better understanding of}} the pathogenesis of SBV infection in <b>adult</b> <b>ruminants,</b> we carried out experimental infections in adult goats. Our specific objectives were: (i) to record clinical signs, viremia and seroconversion; (ii) to monitor viral excretion in the semen of infected bucks; (iii) to determine in which tissues SBV replication took place and virus-induced lesions developed. Results: Four goats and two bucks were inoculated with SBV. Virus inoculation was followed by a short viremic phase lasting 3 to 4 days and a seroconversion occurring between days 7 and 14 pi in all animals. The inoculated goats did not display any clinical signs, gross lesions or histological lesions. Viral genomic RNA was found in one ovary but could not be detected in other organs. SBV RNA was not found in the semen samples collected from two inoculated bucks...|$|R

Schmallenberg virus (SBV), discovered in continental Europe in late 2011, causes mild clinical signs in <b>adult</b> <b>ruminants,</b> including diarrhoea and reduced milk yield. However, fetal infection can lead to severe malformation in newborn offspring. To develop improved reagents for SBV serology, a high-level yeast expression system was employed to produce recombinant SBV nucleocapsid (N) protein. Recombinant SBV N protein was investigated as an antigen in SBV-specific IgG enzyme immunoassay and used for generation of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Yeast-expressed SBV N protein was reactive with anti-SBV IgG-positive cow serum specimens collected from different farms of Lithuania. After immunization of mice with recombinant SBV N protein, four MAbs were generated. TheMAbs raised against recombinant SBVN protein reacted with native viral nucleocapsids in SBV-infected BHK cells by immunofluorescence assay. The reactivity of recombinant N protein with SBV-positive cow serum specimens {{and the ability of}} the MAbs to recognize virus-infected cells confirm the antigenic similarity between yeast-expressed SBV N protein and native viral nucleocapsids. Our study demonstrates that yeast expression system is suitable for high-level production of recombinant SB...|$|R
40|$|Reductive {{acetogenesis}} is not {{competitive with}} methanogenesis in <b>adult</b> <b>ruminants,</b> whereas acetogenic bacteria are the dominant hydrogenotrophs {{in the early}} rumen microbiota. The ecology of hydrogenotrophs in the developing rumen was investigated using young lambs, raised in sterile isolators, and conventional adult sheep. Two lambs were born naturally, left with their dams for 17 h and then placed into a sterile isolator and reared aseptically. They were inoculated with cellulolytic bacteria and later with Methanobrevibacter sp. 87. 7 to investigate the effect of methanogen establishment on the rumen acetogen population since they lacked cultivable representatives of methanogens. Putative acetogens were investigated by acetyl-CoA synthase and formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase gene analysis and methanogens by methyl coenzyme reductase A gene analysis. Unexpectedly, a low abundant but diverse population of methanogens (predominantly Methanobrevibacter spp.) was identified in isolated lambs pre-inoculation with Mbb. sp 87. 7, which {{was similar to the}} community structure in conventional sheep. In contrast, potential acetogen diversity in isolated lambs and conventional sheep was different. Potential acetogens affiliated between the Lachnospiraceae and Clostridiaceae in conventional sheep and with the Blautia genus and the Lachnospiraceae in isolated lambs. The establishment of Mbb. sp. 87. 7 (1, 000 -fold increase in methanogens) did not substantially affect acetogen diversity...|$|R
40|$|Data {{have been}} {{compiled}} to derive animal product transfer coefficients for radionuclides {{to update the}} values given in Technical Reports Series No. 364. Significant new data inputs have been incorporated from an extensive review of Russian language information and inclusion of data published since the early 1990 s. The resultant database {{has been used to}} provide reference transfer coefficient values for a range of radionuclides to (i) cow, sheep and goat milk, (ii) meat (muscle) of cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and poultry and (iii) eggs. The approaches and procedures used to identify and collate data, and assumptions used are given. For most animal products, transfer coefficient values for elements additional to those in Technical Reports Series No. 364 are provided, although some elements were considered in the earlier evaluation which were not included in this review. Differences between the Technical Reports Series No. 364 ‘expected’ values and the reference values from this document, which will be incorporated into the revised transfer parameter handbook, are discussed. An alternative approach to quantifying transfer by using concentration ratios is evaluated and CR values which could be applied across animal species have been provided for milk and meat.

50|$|Haemonchus contortus, {{also known}} as the barber's pole worm, is very common {{parasite}} {{and one of the most}} pathogenic nematodes of <b>ruminants.</b> <b>Adult</b> worms attach to abomasal mucosa and feed on the blood.

In ruminants, parasite causes chronic bronchopneumonia. In case of massive infection or secondary bacterial infection, M. capillaris infection can cause death of the host.|$|R
40|$|Vitamins are organic {{molecules}} with complex molecular structure {{and they are}} essential in minimum quantities for the health, growth and reproduction of rumi-nants (bovine, ovine and caprine) (Table 19. 1). Vitamin deficiency results {{in a number of}} metabolic disorders of varying levels of gravity. Forage has the potential to {{play a significant role in}} the supply of vitamins to ruminants. However, as will be demonstrated, the vitamin content of forages is highly variable and unpredictable and the production of synthetic vitamins was essential to the advent of intensive livestock production. <b>Adult</b> <b>ruminants</b> are different from monogastrics (pigs and poultry) with respect to their dependence on an exogenous supply of vitamins. Synthesis of B-group vita-mins (thiamine, riboflavine, niacin …) and vitamin K occurs during the degrada-tion and fermentation of feed ingredients by ruminal microorganisms. Vitamin D is synthesized by the action of ultraviolet radiation on the sterols present in the skin of ruminants, vitamin C is synthesized from C 6 sugars (glucose and galactose) and niacin from tryptophan (if the amino acid is present in excess). It is therefore mainly with respect to vitamins A and E that ruminants have specific dietary dependence. However, very young ruminants, which do not possess a fully developed rumen and which lack a fully functional rumen microflora, cannot synthesize adequate B-group vitamins. Calves and lambs can therefore suffer from a B-group vitamin defi-ciency. In this instance, as in monogastrics, they are dependent on an exogenous supply of B-group vitamins...|$|R

40|$|Verotoxigenic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli, VTEC and EHEC are strains {{that produce}} a toxin on the Vero cells in vitro, {{therefore}} the toxin called verotoxin. Strain VTEC and EHEC have been isolated from human and various animal species, mainly ruminants and pigs. The prevalence of VTEC in cattle is 35 %, milk 10 %, cheese 1. 5 %. In beef meat, pork, poultry, goat and sheep is 3. 7, 1. 5, 1. 5, 2 and 2. 5 %, respectively. In contrast, the human prevalence in United States, Spain and France 5 – 10, 2. 5 and 3. 4 %, respectively. In Indonesia, nine cases of VTEC {{were reported by}} Ciptomangunkusumo Hospital and four out of nine cases were died. The verotoxin also named Shiga toxins (Stx), is active in vivo as a pathogen on the endothelial cells of the blood vessels of the gastro intestinal mucosa, kidneys, brain and other tissues of human and piglets. Verotoxin in human, ruminants and piglets causes bloody diarrhea so with <b>ruminants.</b> In the <b>adult</b> <b>ruminants,</b> verotoxin results in clinical signs and they act as asymptomatic carriers of VTEC and EHEC strains but in human, it produced haemorrhagic colitis (HC), haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombocytopenia purpura (TPP).
