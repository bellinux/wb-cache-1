40|$|We {{develop a}} North-South model of {{international}} trade and transboundary pollution to analyze the relationship between environmental technology transfer <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>South's</b> incentive to sign a multilateral environmental agreement (MEA).

Second, we show that <b>the</b> <b>South's</b> participation in <b>the</b> MEA would reduce the market incentive of technology transfer. Both results have very clear policy implications for (i) the sequence of technology transfer <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>South's</b> MEA membership <b>and</b> (ii) <b>the</b> legitimacy of <b>South's</b> subsidies for technology transfer...|$|R
