5|$|Along {{with other}} members of the lipocalin protein family, major urinary {{proteins}} can be potent allergens to humans. The reason for this is not known, however molecular mimicry between Mups and structurally similar human lipocalins has been proposed as a possible explanation. The protein product of the mouse Mup17 gene, known as Musm1, Ag1 or MA1, accounts for much of the allergenic properties of mouse urine. The protein is extremely stable in the environment; studies have found 95% of inner city homes, and 82% of all types of homes in the United States have detectable levels in at least one room. Similarly, Ratn1 is a known human allergen. A US study found its presence in 33% of inner city homes, and 21% of occupants were sensitized to the allergen. Exposure and sensitization to rodent Mup proteins is considered a risk factor for childhood asthma, and is a leading cause of laboratory animal allergy (LAA)—an occupational disease of laboratory animal technicians and scientists. One study found that two-thirds of laboratory workers who had developed <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reactions</b> to animals had antibodies to Ratn1.|$|E

The effects of formoterol (Foradil Aerolizer(TM), 24 microg dry powder) on the late <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reaction</b> were assessed by a randomised crossover factorial study in 24 patients with asthma. Four challenge/treatment combinations were tested: (A) saline/placebo, (B) saline/formoterol, (C) allergen/placebo, (D) allergen/formoterol. Formoterol and placebo were administered double blind after the last inhalation of the allergen or saline. FEV(1) was measured up to 32 h. The bronchodilator effect of formoterol was estimated as (B-A) and the overall protective effect as (D-C). The effect not due to bronchodilation was estimated as [(D-C) -(B-A) ]/ 2. The bronchodilator effect of formoterol was statistically significant up to 5 h (all P< or = 0. 015). Formoterol significantly attenuated the late <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reaction</b> between 3 and 32 h after allergen inhalation (all P< or = 0. 0012).

Cyclosporin A (CsA) {{is known to}} inhibit T-cell proliferation, induce apoptosis of CD 4 -positive T-cells and downregulate cytokine gene expression. It was assessed whether CsA-induced inhibition of the late <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reaction</b> was associated with apoptosis of BALF T-lymphocytes and other cell types, as well as expression of the antiapoptotic protein B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma 2 gene product (Bcl- 2). BALF cells were obtained from asthmatics at baseline and 24 h after allergen-inhalation challenge following prior administration of CsA (n= 13) or placebo (n= 11). The number of apoptotic CD 3 -positive T-lymphocytes increased in the CsA but not the placebo group. The numbers of Bcl- 2 -positive cells were significantly reduced in the CsA but not the placebo group. The majority of Bcl- 2 -positive cells were CD 3 -positive T-lymphocytes.

When the subjects developed a late <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reaction</b> after exposure to TDI, they showed an increase in their ECP serum levels. By contrast, there were no significant changes in serum ECP levels after exposure to TDI in the control group or after methacholine challenge in either group. Tryptase levels in serum were not detectable before or during inhalation challenge with TDI or methacholine. There was no significant increase in plasma histamine levels during inhalation challenge with TDI or methacholine. These results suggest that eosinophils are 'activated' in subjects who develop a late <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reaction</b> after exposure to TDI and that the measurement of ECP levels in peripheral blood may be a useful marker to monitor airway inflammation...|$|R

40|$|Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) {{converts}} L-arginine into {{nitric oxide}} (NO) and L-Citrulline. In NO-producing cells, L-citrulline can be recycled to L-arginine in a two-step reaction involving argininosuccinate synthase (ASS) and -lyase (ASL). In guinea pig trachea, L-arginine is a limiting factor in neuronal nNOS-mediated airway smooth muscle relaxation upon inhibitory nonadrenergic noncholinergic (iNANC) nerve stimulation. Moreover, in a guinea pig model of asthma iNANC nerve-induced NO production and airway smooth muscle relaxation are impaired after the allergen-induced early <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reaction,</b> due to limitation Of L-arginine. Using guinea pig tracheal preparations, we now investigated whether (i) the L-citrulline/L-arginine cycle {{is active in}} airway iNANC nerves and (ii) the NO deficiency after the early <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reaction</b> involves impaired L-citrulline recycling. Electrical field stimulation-induced relaxation was measured in tracheal open-rings precontracted with histamine. L-citrulline {{as well as the}} ASL inhibitor succinate did not affect electrical field stimulation-induced relaxation under basal conditions. However, reduced relaxation induced by a submaximal concentration of the NOS inhibitor N-omega-nitro-L-arginine was restored by L-citrulline, which was prevented by the additional presence of succinate or the ASS inhibitor alpha-methyl-D,L-aspartate. Remarkably, the impaired iNANC relaxation after the early <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reaction</b> was restored by L-citrulline. In conclusion, the L-citruiline/L-arginine cycle is operative in guinea pig iNANC nerves in the airways and may be effective under conditions of low L-arginine utilization by nNOS (caused by NOS inhibitors), and during reduced L-arginine availability after allergen challenge. Enzymatic dysfunction in the L-citrulline/L-arginine cycle appears not {{to be involved in the}} L-arginine limitation and reduced iNANC activity after the early <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reaction.</b> (c) 2006 Elsevier B.

ABSTRACT: The effect of hyposensitization (HS) upon the allergen evoked immediate <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reaction</b> (IAR), late <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reaction</b> (LAR) and upon bronchial reactivity towards histamine was examined. Eighteen young asthmatic patients were studied using a double-blind, placebo· controlled design. All were allergic to house dust mite (HDM) and demon-strated an IAR and a LAR after bronchial provocation with HDM. Furthermore, all, except one child, demonstrated bronchial hyperreactivity towards histamine (median provocative dose producing a 20 % fall in forced ex· piratory volume in one second (PD 1 J histamine = 0. 19 mg·ml· 1, range: 0. 02 - 8 mg•ml" 1). The subjects were randomly {{divided into two groups}} to receive HDM or placebo injections during one year. After the one year period, the IAR was less severe in the subjects who received HDM injections (p= 0. 02), while this reduction was not observed in the subjects who received placebo injections. Also, in the HDM group a small but significant increase of the median PD 10 HDM was observed (p= 0. 04). Further· more, the LAR was less severe in tl:ie subjects who received HDM injections (p= 0. 02), while the subjects who received placebo injections showed the same severity of LAR after one year (p= 0. 44).

50|$|Cladosporium cladosporioides rarely causes {{infections in}} humans, {{although}} superficial infections have been reported. It can occasionally cause pulmonary and cutaneous phaeohyphomycosis {{and it has}} been isolated from cerebrospinal fluid in an immunocompromised patient. This species can trigger <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reactions</b> due to the presence of allergens and beta-glucans on its spore surface. In mice, living C. cladosporioides spores have induced hyperresponsiveness of the lungs, as well as an increase in eosinophils, which are white blood cells typically associated with asthmatic and allergic reactions. Cladosporium cladosporioides can also induce respiratory inflammation due to the up-regulation of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 and keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC), which are cytokines involved in the mediation of inflammation. A case of mycotic encephalitis and nephritis due to C. cladosporioides has been described in a dog, resulting in altered behaviour, depression, abnormal reflexes in all 4 limbs and loss of vision. Post-mortem examination indicated posterior brainstem and cerebellar lesions, confirming the causative involvement of the agent.|$|E
5000|$|Asthmatic {{subjects}} in 9 to 11 years old, 80% to 85% of asthma exacerbations that {{were associated with}} reduced peak expiratory flow rates and wheezing were due to viral upper respiratory tract infections (URIs).

[...] It turns out that rhinovirus are capable of inducing epithelial cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines that result in airway hyperresponsiveness, neurogenic inflammatory responses, mucous secretion, inflammatory cell recruitment and activation, and plasma leakage. To support this statement, asthmatic subjects that are infected with rhinovirus have demonstrated an increase in airway hyperresponsiveness, airway obstruction, and inflammation. Similarly, rhinovirus infection has caused subjects with allergic rhinitis but no history of asthma to have a significantly increased airway hyperreactivity {{as well as a}} significantly increased incidence of late <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reactions.</b> This shows that in addition to causing airway hyperreactivity, rhinovirus also promotes the onset of non-atopic asthma.

We observed that the steroidal anti-inflammatory agent prednisone, but not the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent indomethacin, inhibits the late (but not the early) <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reactions</b> induced by TDI. Prednisone also inhibits the increase of bronchial responsiveness and the increase of neutrophils, eosinophils, and albumin in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid that are associated with late <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reactions</b> induced by exposure to TDI. Beclomethasone has a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on TDI-induced late <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reactions,</b> whereas theophylline has a partial inhibitory effect on both early and late <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reactions,</b> and verapamil, ketotifen, cromolyn.

By contrast, neutrophils, eosinophils and airway responsiveness were not increased at 8 h after TDI in subjects with an early asthmatic reaction or at 2 h after TDI in normal control subjects. These results suggest that late <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reactions</b> to TDI, and the associated increase in airway responsiveness, may be caused by airway inflammation...|$|E
40|$|Introduction:? Inhalation {{allergen}} {{challenge in}} humans {{is used to}} investigate lung pathophysiology and responses to novel therapies. However, the single high-dose allergen challenges that are commonly performed do not mimic repeated symptomatic environmental allergen exposure. Objectives:? To develop and evaluate {{the safety of a}} repeated high-dose symptomatic inhalation allergen challenge model. Methods:? Sixteen subjects with atopic asthma were recruited. Each underwent three inhalation allergen challenges using house dust mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) antigen at 48 -h intervals with a target of symptom induction and an early <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reaction</b> fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) of 15 % from baseline. Results:? All of the subjects completed the three-challenge protocol and the target immediate airway bronchoconstrictor response was achieved in all the subjects at all challenges. There were no adverse events recorded. The early <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reaction</b> was similar for the three challenges whether measured as mean maximal fall in FEV 1 or mean area under the curve. The late <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reaction</b> was also similar over the three challenges with no evidence of priming or desensitisation. Symptom scores and reliever medication use significantly increased over the time of the challenges. Baseline lung function and reversibility was unchanged 4 days after the last challenge. Conclusion:? We demonstrate that repeated high-dose inhaled house dust mite allergen challenge in human volunteers with mild asthma is safe, repeatable and acceptable. This allows the use of this model in further studies focused on understanding the pathophysiology of allergen induced asthma and the impact of therapeutic interventions. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Background: False-negative {{responses}} to specific inhalation challenge (SIC) with occupational agents may occur. We explored whether assessing changes in sputum cell counts would help improve {{the identification of}} bronchial reactivity to occupational agents during SICs. Methods: The predictive value {{of the changes in}} sputum cell counts after a negative FEV(1) response to a first challenge exposure to an occupational agent was determined using the changes in airway calibre observed during repeated challenges as the 'gold standard'. The study included 68 subjects investigated for work-related asthma in a tertiary centre. After a control day, the subjects were challenged with the suspected occupational agent(s) for up to 2 h. All subjects who did not show an <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reaction</b> were re-challenged on the following day. Additional challenges were proposed to those who demonstrated a >/= 2 % increase in sputum eosinophils or an increase in nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness to histamine after the second challenge day. Results: Six of the 35 subjects without changes in FEV(1) on the first challenge developed an <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reaction</b> on subsequent challenges. ROC analysis revealed that a > 3 % increase in sputum eosinophils {{at the end of the}} first challenge day was the most accurate parameter for predicting the development of an asthmatic response on subsequent challenges with a sensitivity of 67 % and a specificity of 97 %.

40|$|Abstract: This review first {{describes}} the mechanism and cell types involved in allergic asthma, {{which is a}} complex clinical disease characterized by airway obstruction, airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness {{to a variety of}} stimuli. The development of allergic asthma exists of three phases, namely the induction phase, the early-phase <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reaction</b> (EAR) and the late-phase <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reaction</b> (LAR). In the induction phase, antigen-presenting cells play a major role. Most important cells in the EAR are mast cells, and during the LAR, various cell types, such as eosinophils, neutrophils, T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), and cells that endow structure are involved. In occupational asthma, this immunological mechanism is involved in 90 % of the cases. The second part of this review gives an overview of in vitro models to assess the hazardous potential of high- and low-molecular weight chemicals on the respiratory system. In order to develop a good in vitro model for respiratory allergy, the choice of appropriate cell types is important. Epithelial cells, macrophages and DCs are currently the most used models in this field of research...|$|R

At 6 h after allergen provocation (after the early <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reaction)</b> bronchial hyperreactivity to histamine aerosol was observed, which was still present, but reduced, at 24 h after the challenge (after the late <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reaction).</b> The severity of bronchial hyperreactivity at 6 h and at 24 h after each of four daily allergen provocations was progressively reduced. The contractile properties of tracheal smooth muscle preparations in response to methacholine or histamine were not changed at 6 h and 24 h after a single allergen provocation, as well as at 24 h after the fourth of the repeated provocations. However, the sensitivity to isoprenaline-induced relaxation of a half-maximal contraction obtained with methacholine or histamine was significantly reduced at 24 h after either a single or the fourth of the repeated provocations. The time course of the reduced beta-adrenoceptor sensitivity in vitro did not correlate with that of bronchial hyperreactivity in vivo. However, it was parallelled by a progressive infiltration of inflammatory cells in the airways, suggesting that mediators from these cells may decrease airway smooth muscle beta-adrenoceptor sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} the threshold duration of exposure needed to elicit an <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reaction</b> during specific inhalation challenges (SIC) with various occupational agents and to determine the duration of exposure that should be completed before the test can be considered negative. MethodsThis retrospective study analysed the cumulative duration of challenge exposure that was required to elicit a ≥ 20 % fall in forced expiratory volume in one second in 335 consecutive subjects with a positive SIC. ResultsThe threshold duration of challenge exposure required to induce an <b>asthmatic</b> <b>reaction</b> was ≤ 60  min in 179 (53 %) subjects, between 61 and 120  min in 74 (22 %) subjects, and longer than 120  min in 82 (25 %) subjects. The multivariate linear regression analysis showed that a longer duration of exposure was associated with exposure to low-molecular-weight agents (p <  0. 001), a higher level of baseline non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness to histamine (p =  0. 015), increasing age (p =  0. 011), and a shorter duration of asthma symptoms at work (p =  0. 060). ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that the sensitivity of SICs for diagnosing OA is highly dependent upon the duration of the challenge exposure. These data may provide useful guidance for improving the reliability of SICs performed with realistic methods of exposure...|$|R
