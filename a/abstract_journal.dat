50|$|In 1839, he {{received}} a military fellowship (a scholarship for gifted {{children from poor family}} to become arm surgeon), for studying medicine at Friedrich-Wilhelms Institute in Berlin (now Humboldt University of Berlin). He was most influenced by Johannes Peter Müller. He defended his thesis titled de rheumate praesertim corneae (corneal manifestations of rheumatic disease) for medical degree on 21 October 1843, with Müller as his doctoral advisor. Immediately on graduation he became subordinate physician to Müller. But shortly after, he joined the Charité Hospital in Berlin for internship. In 1844, he was appointed as medical assistant to the prosector (pathologist) Robert Froriep, from whom he learned microscopy for his interest in pathology. Froriep was also the editor of an <b>abstract</b> <b>journal</b> that specialised in foreign work, allowing Virchow to be exposed to the more forward-looking scientific ideas of France and England.|$|E

Using articles first-authored or last-authored by board members of Retrovirology, we show here that the reverse is true when the future success of an article is to be predicted. The H index proved unsuitable for this specific task because, surprisingly, an article's odds of becoming a 'hit' appear independent of the pre-eminence of its author.

40|$|M. Bibl. (Information Studies) Traditionally {{it is part}} of {{the library}} or {{information}} service to provide clients with access to current and relevant information through current awareness services. It is part of the information professional's task to apply new technology and necessary services to the advantage of the clients. The purpose of this study was to establish, by means of empirical research, the effectiveness of CoMIC - an <b>abstracting</b> <b>journal</b> service currently provided to the mining industry. Other institutions providing a similar <b>abstracting</b> <b>journal</b> service should be able to use this methodology as a basis when evaluating their own service. Both a literature survey (to gain basic information about current awareness services in general and more specifically <b>abstracting</b> <b>journals)</b> and a postal questionnaire (to establish clients' opinions about the CoMIC service) were used during the study. From the literature survey it was established that the use of an effective current awareness service holds a variety of advantages. There are however also a few problems associated with the provision of current awareness services. These problems are surpassable providing the necessary precautions are taken in time. The criteria to which <b>abstracting</b> <b>journals</b> are to adhere were established. The purpose of the questionnaire was to give clients the oportunity to express their personal views with regard to the CoMIC service. The most important information extrapolated from the questionnaire was that respondents were satisfied with most aspects of the service. Recommendations with regard to alleviating a few minor problems were provided. After an analysis of the research results, it was concluded that CoMIC should be classified as an effective <b>abstracting</b> <b>journal</b> service...|$|R
