5|$|A {{total of}} sixty-nine poems, sixty short stories, and three serials were {{published}} in Asia Raya, a newspaper in the Dutch East Indies and early Indonesia. First published on 29 April 1942, months after the Empire of Japan invaded the Indies, Asia Raya was established under the occupation government and intended <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> for pro-Japanese propaganda– including literature. Run by both Japanese and native staff, the newspaper remained in publication until 7September 1945, closing {{less than a month}} after Indonesia proclaimed its independence.|$|E
5|$|Although these criticisms still {{form the}} {{prevailing}} {{view on the}} History's literary worth, modern scholars such as Rohrbacher have begun to argue that, while it is poorly written and not a stylistic or polished work, its use of allusion <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> for parodying popular late 4th century biographical and historiographical works means that the very features which were once a cause for intense criticism (such as the inclusion of irrelevant or contradictory inventions alongside traditionally sourced material) are actually an intentional and {{integral part of the}} work, {{making it one of the}} most unique pieces of literature to emerge from the ancient world.|$|E

5|$|Gary {{uses the}} novel <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> to {{denounce}} both racism and the activists supporting African-American rights, {{including his own}} ex-wife and Marlon Brando. He also examines whether human responses to situations, including racism, are learned social behavior and whether they can be unlearned. In 1981, it was adapted into the controversial film of the same name, in which director Samuel Fuller made various changes to the novel's story {{to focus more on}} the dog and present a more pessimistic ending than the original novel. The film's American release after negative press from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) led to concerns of boycotts.|$|E
5|$|He {{developed}} a reputation for honesty, diligence {{and the ability to}} testify effectively before legislative hearings and to speak clearly to the press. In 1936, he cofounded the American Labor Party, a pro-union political party active in New York, along with David Dubinsky and Sidney Hillman, partly <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> to organize support for the re-election that year of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and mayor Fiorello La Guardia among socialists in the union movement.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Led Zeppelin took a {{break from}} touring and {{launched}} their own record label, Swan Song, named after an unreleased song. The record label's logo, based on a drawing called Evening: Fall of Day (1869) by William Rimmer, features a picture of Apollo. The logo {{can be found on}} Led Zeppelin memorabilia, especially T-shirts. In addition to using Swan Song <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> to promote their own albums, the band expanded the label's roster, signing artists such as Bad Company, the Pretty Things and Maggie Bell. The label was successful while Led Zeppelin existed, but folded less than three years after they disbanded.|$|E

5|$|Morehead's term as {{governor}} {{was an active}} one. He approved the appropriation of funding for the first Kentucky State Fair, which was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> for encouraging improvements in agriculture. He also approved {{the formation of the}} Kentucky State Agricultural Society in 1856. The state geological survey begun under Governor Lazarus W. Powell was completed and published. Internal improvements progressed as well; railroad mileage in the state increased from 242 miles to 568 miles during Morehead's term.|$|E
5|$|Once General Tire {{sold the}} network in 1957, Mutual's {{ownership}} was largely {{disconnected from the}} stations it served, leading to a more conventional, top-down model of program production and distribution. Not long after the sale, one of the network's new executive teams was charged with accepting money to use Mutual <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> for foreign propaganda. The network's reputation was severely damaged, but soon rebounded. Mutual changed hands frequently in succeeding years—even leaving aside larger-scale acquisitions and mergers, its final direct corporate parent, Westwood One, which purchased Mutual in 1985, was the seventh {{in a string of}} new owners that followed General Tire.|$|E
5|$|Reduced {{to a minor}} character, the new fictional Napoleon became not a world {{historical}} figure but {{an intimate}} one, fashioned by individuals' needs and consumed as popular entertainment. In their attempts to represent the emperor as a figure of national unity, proponents and detractors of the Third Republic used the legend <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> for exploring anxieties about gender and fears about the processes of democratization that accompanied this new era of mass politics and culture.|$|E

5|$|Sunny Stories {{was renamed}} Enid Blyton's Sunny Stories in January 1937, and served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> for the {{serialisation}} of Blyton's books. Her first Naughty Amelia Jane story, about an anti-heroine {{based on a}} doll owned by her daughter Gillian, {{was published in the}} magazine. Blyton stopped contributing in 1952, and it closed down the following year, shortly before the appearance of the new fortnightly Enid Blyton Magazine written entirely by Blyton. The first edition appeared on 18 March 1953, and the magazine ran until September 1959.|$|E
5|$|The holonovel was {{intended}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> to further explore Janeway's imagination and her social relationships, but critics disagreed {{on whether the}} storyline was appropriate for the character. The plotlines introduced in Janeway Lambda one were never fully resolved {{due to lack of}} interest from fans of the Voyager series and an attempt to target a male audience; Taylor had written a conclusion for the holonovel, but it was never developed into an episode. Janeway Lambda one was received negatively by television critics who believed it was poorly developed and too isolated from the main storylines of the Voyager series. The show's frequent use and expansion of the holodeck technology was also panned by reviewers.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{originally}} developed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> and sitcom debut for Shannen Doherty under the working title Wingwoman. Though {{picked up by}} UPN, Doherty {{was removed from the}} project {{at the request of the}} network due to her poor reception by preview audiences; she was replaced by Philipps. The show was set in New York City, but filming took place at Paramount Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles and other locations in California. It included contemporary hip hop music and was promoted heavily by UPN to attract an urban audience, and to that end it was paired with Everybody Hates Chris as its lead-in on Thursday nights.|$|E

5|$|A {{secondary}} theme which {{drives the}} contest for the champion's portion is the rivalry between the royal provinces of Connacht and Ulster, {{resolved in the}} contest of the two heroes Cet Mac Mágach and Conall Cernach. The presentation of this rivalry is coloured by the author's peculiar Leinster viewpoint. He turns both provinces to ridicule by the cunning of Mac Da Thó, King of Leinster; in particular, the author's political sympathies favour Connacht and remain hostile to Ulster to the end. To the heroes assembled, Mac Da Thó boasts that all the food provided for the feast is a mere trifle for the Leinstermen. It is tempting {{to conclude that the}} inspiration of the story is the claim of Leinster to supersede both Ulster and Connacht. However, it is apparent that {{by the time of the}} tale's composition, even the story-teller does not take the political issues very seriously, using the theme instead <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> for a good story.|$|E
5|$|As the Cold War {{developed}} and the Guatemalan government clashed with U.S. corporations on {{an increasing number}} of issues, the U.S. government grew increasingly suspicious of the Guatemalan Revolution. In addition, the Cold War predisposed the Truman administration to see the Guatemalan government as communist. Arévalo's support for the Caribbean Legion also worried the Truman administration, which saw it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> for communism, rather than as the anti-dictatorial force it was conceived as. Until the end of its term, the Truman administration had relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to try and reduce the perceived communist influence. The U.S. had refused to sell arms to the Guatemalan government after 1944; in 1951 it began to block all weapons purchases by Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|Following on {{from the}} {{previous}} volume in the series, The Calculus Affair, The Red Sea Sharks was created {{with the aid of}} Hergé's team of artists at Studios Hergé. Influenced by Honoré de Balzac's The Human Comedy, Hergé used the story <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> in which to reintroduce a wide range of characters who had first appeared in earlier installments of the series. The story dealt with the ongoing trade in enslaved Africans across the Arab world, however in the 1960s the story would generate controversy as Hergé was repeatedly accused of having portrayed the Africans in a racist manner. He was upset by these claims, and made alterations to the depiction of the Africans in later reprints. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Tintin in Tibet, and the series as a whole became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. The Red Sea Sharks was critically well-received, with various commentators describing it {{as one of the best}} Tintin adventures. The story was adapted for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana.|$|E
