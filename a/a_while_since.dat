The song was rejected, according to Greenwood, for being [...] "too dark". Godrich said: [...] "That fucking James Bond movie threw us a massive curveball. It was a real waste of energy. We stopped doing {{what we were doing}} and had to concentrate on that for <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>since</b> we were told it was something that was going to come to fruition ...

500|$|The {{reception}} of [...] "The D'oh-cial Network" [...] by television critics has been generally mixed. The Guardian reviewer Sam Wollaston called the episode [...] "lovely", arguing that while [...] "The Simpsons perhaps doesn't deliver {{as often as}} it once did," [...] this episode proved [...] "it still can, after all this time." [...] The Evening Heralds Pat Stacey wrote that it has [...] "been <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>since</b> The Simpsons delivered a gold medal-standard performance, yet at least there were satisfying flashes of silver [...]" [...] She added that she [...] "liked the moment when Hans Moleman is hit by Homer's car and frantically hammers the 'Dislike' button as he sails through the air." ...|$|E

500|$|Within {{a week of}} the episode's {{original}} broadcast, three deleted {{scenes from}} [...] "Sister City" [...] were made available on the official Parks and Recreation website. In the first 100-second clip, Ron talks about his hatred for socialism, and Raul says he fears Ron because of his mustache, which he said makes him [...] "cower in fear" [...] (repeatedly saying the word 'mustache'). In the second minute-long clip, Raul discusses the medals he received for his parks-related accomplishments, including [...] "doing away with people making speeches in the parks", [...] "organizing the garbage so it's not all over the place" [...] and [...] "looking at the leaves". In the third 100-second clip, Raul and the Venezuelans question why Leslie {{does not have a}} giant oil painting of herself in her office. After his final argument with Leslie, Tom refuses to follow Raul's orders to open the door for him, and Raul has trouble opening it because [...] "it's been <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>since</b> I've done this".|$|E
500|$|The album {{version of}} [...] "Hello Sunshine" [...] is 3 minutes 35 seconds long {{and is in}} the key of D major. The track begins with 43 seconds of the track [...] "By the Sea" [...] from Wendy & Bonnie's 1969 album Genesis {{featuring}} sparse fingerstyle guitar and female harmony vocals. The last syllable of the line [...] "...so hard to say goodbye" [...] is held and pans from left to right until [...] "Hello Sunshine" [...] itself begins with Gruff Rhys singing the title phrase, joined by the band on the second word. The first verse follows with simple piano and bass guitar backing Rhys's acoustic guitar to a basic 4/4 beat provided by drummer Dafydd Ieuan. The first chorus enters at 1 minute 13 seconds with Rhys being joined by falsetto harmony backing vocals on the lines [...] "In honesty it's been <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>since</b> we had reason left to smile". The song breaks down for the bridge with just arpeggio guitar, simple bass and occasional drum rolls playing as the lines [...] "Hello sunshine, come into my life" [...] are sung.|$|E
500|$|... "Antes de las Seis" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic highlighted {{it as an}} example of Shakira's versatility and commented that the album [...] "catches its breath on the ballad." [...] Mikael Wood from Entertainment Weekly termed the song a [...] "gorgeous ballad" [...] and encouraged readers to download it. Jesus Yanez-Reyes from Northern Arizona News gave [...] "Antes de las Seis" [...] a very positive review and praised its lyrics and Shakira's [...] "heartfelt" [...] vocal delivery as having the ability [...] "to overcome whatever language barriers may exist between the artist and the listener, truly making it a song of note within the release." [...] Jennifer Schaffer from the Stanford Daily complimented the sensitivity of the song and commented that [...] "Shakira offers her listeners a far more vulnerable persona" [...] through it. Carlos Macias from Terra Music picked [...] "Antes de las Seis" [...] as his favourite track from the album and commended its lyrics, calling them [...] "classic Shakira" [...] and concluding that [...] "It'd been <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>since</b> the Colombian superstar offered us an insight into her heart." [...] At the Premios Nuestra Tierra awards ceremony in 2012, [...] "Antes de las Seis" [...] was nominated for [...] "Mejor Interpretación Pop Del Año" [...] ("Best Pop Performance of the Year").|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, [...] "... {{the movie}} is filled with life and energy, and the music is honest." [...] On the {{syndicated}} television program Siskel & Ebert At the Movies, Ebert gave the film a [...] "Thumbs Up" [...] rating, while his colleague, Gene Siskel, gave the film a [...] "Thumbs Down". Siskel, writing for the Chicago Tribune, stated that the film was [...] "a joyful but empty mixture of Irish kids and black American soul music". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly criticized the overall premise as being [...] "downright insulting", explaining, [...] "In Parker's hands, soul music becomes {{little more than a}} self-serving metaphor – an easy symbol for 'commitment' and integrity." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "... the predictable way in which the band's nine men and three women argue about music, sex and fame robs the story of urgency." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times stated, [...] "The Commitments becomes repetitive after <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>since</b> so much of it is about the group's stage show, and since the effort to create an off-stage story never really works." [...] David Denby of New York Magazine wrote the film has [...] "a raspy surface authenticity {{and a great deal of}} affection for its characters and milieu but not much dramatic interest." ...|$|E
500|$|Erik Adams of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a {{moderately}} positive review and awarded it a [...] "B". Adams highlighted the serious discussion between Darryl and Jim in the warehouse, noting that [...] "Jim's extrication {{is something to}} root for", and that it honored [...] "Craig Robinson's dedication to the show". While feeling {{that some of the}} episode's subplots were [...] "forced", he did, however, compliment the Pam and Nellie pairing due to [...] "Pam's past ability to break through [...] Angela and Dwight's defenses". Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste magazine noted that, despite Andy's regression to [...] "his old ways", it was beneficial for the episode and allowed for many jokes to be played out. Furthermore, Stiernberg applauded the subtle drama that ran throughout the entry, writing Darryl, Erin, and Pete's interactions with Andy were important to the overall storyline. Mark Trammell of TV Equals named it [...] "the best episode of the final season of The Office to date" [...] because it [...] "played to the show's strengths". Furthermore, he complimented the character development of Nellie, writing that she [...] "really started to grow on me this week" [...] and that his favorite line was Darryl's [...] "words of wisdom" [...] to Jim: [...] "It's not real until your wife is on board." [...] Michael Tedder of New York magazine gave the episode a positive review and noted that [...] "It's been <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>since</b> The Office was this surprising and moving." [...] He wrote that the main plot allowed for [...] "overdue development" [...] in regards to other characters and applauded the continued drama involving Pam and Jim; he called the last shot [...] "quietly heartbreaking". He did, however, call it a [...] "particularly overstuffed episode", and felt that Erin's subplot could have been saved for a different episode.|$|E

2500|$|GameSpot's Greg Kasavin {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about the combat system, arguing, [...] "The combat gets to be repetitive after <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> <b>Since</b> you only have direct control over one character, who'll mostly depend on the same basic attacks regardless of which weapons you've equipped, the battles don't feel particularly varied {{from one to the}} next." [...] He concluded, [...] "the PlayStation 2 has delivered an almost countless number of high-quality Japanese role-playing games, so all the past competition is really the main reason why Rogue Galaxy doesn't come off as a stunning accomplishment. On the other hand, though, this is a game that does enough differently or better than most of its PS2 predecessors that it's still well deserving of your consideration." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before making The Shining, Stanley Kubrick had {{directed}} the 1975 movie Barry Lyndon, a highly visual period film about an Irish man who {{attempts to make}} his way into the British aristocracy. Despite its technical achievements, the film was not a box office success in the United States and was derided by critics for being too long and too slow. Kubrick, disappointed with Barry Lyndons lack of success, realized he needed to make a film that would be commercially viable as well as artistically fulfilling. Stephen King was told [...] that Kubrick had his staff bring him stacks of horror books as he planted [...] himself in his office to read them all: [...] "Kubrick's secretary heard the sound of each book hitting the wall as the director flung it into a reject pile after reading the first few pages. Finally one day the secretary noticed it had been <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>since</b> she had heard the thud of another writer's work biting the dust. She walked in to check on her boss and found Kubrick deeply engrossed in reading The Shining." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gordon Smart, the show-business editor from The Sun, {{said that}} Dyer was a [...] "brilliant signing for EastEnders—they are a match in soap heaven", {{saying it was}} [...] "about time" [...] that the show brought in some [...] "fresh blood". He said, [...] "It has been <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>since</b> the {{struggling}} Albert Square show had a character with presence beyond The Queen Vic and Danny is just the man for the job." [...] He added that Dyer's good acting skills and [...] "bags of character" [...] would give EastEnders [...] "the geezer it's been crying out for." [...] However, the newspaper's television critic, Ally Ross, said that EastEnders had reached a [...] "dead end" [...] recently and their solution was to bring in Dyer: [...] "one of those slap-the-forehead appointments that instantly has you wondering, 'which {{one of them is}} slumming it?' General consensus seemed to believe it was EastEnders—though given the show's ratings and endless comings and goings, I'd actually argue it's [...] Dyer who could do a lot better here." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 6 December 2013, it was {{announced}} that Turner would return to the soap to reprise her role as Stacey, and would begin filming in January 2014. Turner was quoted as saying: [...] "I may have left EastEnders over three years ago but the show has always been in my heart, as has Stacey, and she has never really left my side. I am so excited about returning and seeing what the future holds for her. [...] It's been <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>since</b> I set foot in Albert Square and I am looking forward to coming home." [...] Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins added: [...] "Stacey is one of EastEnders best-loved characters, played by one of television's finest actors, and I am tremendously excited that Lacey has decided to return home to Walford. Stacey's last time on the Square was iconic. But that was just the first act. There is so much more to come for Stacey—and her return will send ripples of drama through the Square." [...] Stacey confesses to the murder of Archie Mitchell. Lacey Turner took a break to film the new series of Our Girl. It was confirmed that Stacey will return to EastEnders once filming has finished.|$|E

2500|$|Jeta Amata, {{who grew}} up in the Niger Delta stated in an {{interview}} that it has been <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>since</b> he has wanted to make a film on the Niger Delta. He had written three scripts on it for about eight years; but as the issues kept escalating, it seemed more difficult to make [...] "but I got to the point where I knew it just has to be now". [...] Black November is fiction based on an actual event, the title being derived from the month in which activist Ken Saro-Wiwa was executed in 1995. Amata had once met Saro-Wiwa through his father and was affected by his death. The recent Niger Delta militancy further triggered Amata's interest to make the film; Jeta Amata had to meet with most of the Niger Delta ex-militants such as Asari Dokubo and Boyloaf to listen to their sides of the story. He stated in an interview: [...] "What I'm doing is what they did, but without weapons." [...] Amata explained that even though the film touched some political points, he is more concerned about the human parts of the story, about the feelings of the people and what they passed through: [...] "We are not trying to fight the government, trying to fight the oil companies, no -- we are trying to repair what has been damaged". [...] The film was majorly funded by a Nigerian business magnate, Captain Hosa Wells Okunbo, who says he does not want to go down in history as [...] "just another rich merchant", he wants to give something back to the region that made him wealthy.|$|E
