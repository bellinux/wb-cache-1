40|$|Chromosomal rearrangements {{are a major}} {{driver of}} {{eukaryotic}} genome evolution, affecting speciation, pathogenicity and cancer progression. Changes in chromosome structure are often initiated by mis-repair of double-strand breaks in the DNA. Mis-repair is particularly likely when telomeres are lost or when dispersed repeats misalign during crossing-over. Fungi carry highly polymorphic chromosomal complements showing substantial variation in chromosome length and number. The mechanisms driving chromosome polymorphism in fungi are poorly understood. We aimed to identify mechanisms of chromosomal rearrangements in the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. We combined population genomic resequencing and chromosomal segment PCR assays with electrophoretic karyotyping and resequencing of parents and offspring from experimental crosses to show that this pathogen harbors a highly diverse complement of accessory chromosomes that exhibits strong global geographic differentiation in numbers and lengths of chromosomes. Homologous chromosomes carried highly differentiated gene contents due to numerous insertions and deletions. The largest <b>accessory</b> <b>chromosome</b> recently doubled in length through insertions totaling 380 kb. Based on comparative genomics, we identified the precise breakpoint locations of these insertions. Nondisjunction during meiosis led to chromosome losses in progeny of three different crosses.

In the reference strain of the wheat pathogen, Zymoseptoria tritici, eight discrete <b>accessory</b> <b>chromosomes</b> {{have been found}}. So far, no functional role has been assigned to these chromosomes; however, they have existed as separate entities in the karyotypes of Zymoseptoria species over evolutionary time. In this study, we addressed what - if anything - distinguishes the chromatin of <b>accessory</b> <b>chromosomes</b> from core chromosomes. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing ("ChIP-seq") of DNA associated with the centromere-specific histone H 3, CENP-A (CenH 3), to identify centromeric DNA, and ChIP-seq with antibodies against dimethylated H 3 K 4, trimethylated H 3 K 9 and trimethylated H 3 K 27 to determine the relative distribution and proportion of euchromatin, obligate and facultative heterochromatin, respectively. Results: Centromeres of the eight <b>accessory</b> <b>chromosomes</b> have the same sequence composition and structure as centromeres of the 13 core chromosomes and they are of similar length. Unlike those of most other fungi, Z. tritici centromeres are not composed entirely of repetitive DNA; some centromeres contain only unique DNA sequences, and bona fide expressed genes are located in regions enriched with CenH 3. By fluorescence microscopy, we showed that centromeres of Z. tritici do not cluster into a single chromocenter during interphase. We found dramatically higher enrichment of H 3 K 9 me 3 and H 3 K 27 me 3 on the <b>accessory</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> consistent with the twofold higher proportion of repetitive DNA and poorly transcribed genes.

This HCV is stably maintained in the hamster cell line. It consists mainly of alphoid sequences of human chromosome 20 and a fragment of human chromosome region 1 p 22, containing the tissue factor gene F 3. The vector has an active centromere, and telomere sequences are lacking. By transfecting a plasmid containing the 5 ′ end of HPRT and a Cre-encoding plasmid into the HCV+ hamster cell line, the HPRT minigene was reconstituted by Cre-mediated recombination and expressed by the cells. The HCV was then transferred to male mouse R 1 -ES cells and it did segregate properly. Chimeras were generated containing the HCV as an independent chromosome in a proportion of the cells. Part of the male and female offspring of the chimeras did contain the HCV. The HCV+ F 1 animals harbored the extra chromosome in > 80 % of the cells. The HCV was present as an independent chromosome with an active centromere and the human F 3 gene was expressed from the HCV in a human-tissue-specific manner.

40|$|Proteins {{secreted}} by pathogens during host colonization largely {{determine the}} outcome of pathogen-host interactions and are commonly called 'effectors'. In fungal plant pathogens, coordinated transcriptional up-regulation of effector genes is a key feature of pathogenesis and effectors are often encoded in genomic regions with distinct repeat content, histone code and rate of evolution. In the tomato pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Fol), effector genes reside on one of four <b>accessory</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> known as the 'pathogenicity' chromosome, which can be exchanged between strains through horizontal transfer. The three other <b>accessory</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in the Fol reference strain may also be important for virulence towards tomato. Expression of effector genes in Fol is highly up-regulated upon infection and requires Sge 1, a transcription factor encoded on the core genome. Interestingly, the pathogenicity chromosome itself contains 13 predicted transcription factor genes and for all except one, there is a homolog on the core genome. We determined DNA binding specificity for nine transcription factors using oligonucleotide arrays. The binding sites for homologous transcription factors were highly similar, suggesting that extensive neofunctionalization of DNA binding specificity has not occurred. Several DNA binding sites are enriched on <b>accessory</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> and expression of FTF 1, its core homolog FTF 2 and SGE 1 from a constitutive promoter can induce expression of effector genes. The DNA binding sites of only these three transcription factors are enriched among genes up-regulated during infection. We further show that Ftf 1, Ftf 2 and Sge 1 can activate transcription from their binding sites in yeast. RNAseq analysis revealed that in strains with constitutive expression of FTF 1, FTF 2 or SGE 1, expression of a similar set of plant-responsive genes on the pathogenicity chromosome is induced, including most effector genes. We conclude that the Fol pathogenicity chromosome may be partially transcriptionally autonomous, {{but there are also}} extensive transcriptional connections between core and <b>accessory</b> <b>chromosomes...</b>|$|R

There was no evidence of multivalent formation, suggesting that the process of diploidization has gone to completion in the males of this ancient polyploid species.

40|$|The {{association}} of small <b>accessory</b> marker <b>chromosomes</b> in man with specific abnormalities {{has been difficult}} to define owing to variations in the chromosome origin {{and the size of the}} markers. In a patient with typical Turner phenotype and a 45,X/ 46,X, + mar karyotype the marker was shown to be a small portion of the long arm of the X chromosome which included the centromere and XIST, a candidate gene for the X inactivation centre. Therefore the lack of any additional abnormalities was attributed to inactivation of the portion of the X chromosome in the marker. In a patient with a 47,XY, + mar karyotype the mar was a small ring X chromosome which did not contain the XIST gene. For both markers the short arm breakpoints were localised between UBE 1 and DXS 423 E. The congenital abnormalities of the male patient were attributed to the lack of X inactivation of the small ring and therefore disomic expression of normal genes possessed by the marker...|$|R
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to determine if <b>accessory</b> (B) <b>chromosomes,</b> the abnormal tenth (K 10) chromosome or the aberrant ratio (AR) phenomenon of maize (Zea mays L.) affect {{the resistance of the}} plants to viral infection. Genetically similar stocks of maize with and without these elements were compared to determine what effect they would have on the plants response to Brome Mosaic Virus (BMV), Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus (MDMV), Wheat Streak Mosaic Virus (WSMV) and Barley Stripe Mosaic Virus (BSMV). —The test results with BSMV were not found to be conclusive. With BMV and MDMV, neither the B orK 10 chromosomes were found to alter infections; however, these chromosomes were found to affect the resistance of the plants to WSMV infection. The B chromosomes were found to delay the onset of leaf necrosis by 15 %, while the K 10 chromosome was found to increase the susceptibility to necrosis by 100 %. The AR phenomenon was not found to alter the resistance of maize to BMV infection. However, it was found to increase the susceptibility of maize to MDMV infection by 36 % and to decrease the susceptibility of maize to WSMV infection by 92 %...|$|R

Even though purifying selection is acting on the whole genome, the accessory component is evolving more rapidly. This component is constituted largely for proteins for transport of diverse metabolites and elements of external origin. The present analysis allows us t...|$|R

40|$|Mutations are the {{ultimate}} source of the biological diversity on which natural selection acts, {{but the vast majority}} of these mutations are harmful. As such, mutations lead to disease states like cancer, extinction of small populations, and can drive pathogen evolution. Unfortunately, because mutations are rare and past studies have been subject to detection biases, very little is known about the distribution of fitness effects from naturally occurring mutations. In this study, we used mutation accumulation and full genome sequencing to capture naturally occurring mutations before they were exposed to the sieve of natural selection in Vibrio fischeri. We then measured the effects of these mutations on the fitness of the individuals harboring these mutations. We hypothesized that most mutations would be deleterious, and that deletions and insertions would be more detrimental to fitness than base substitutions, particularly in coding regions. Additionally, we expected to show that mutations on primary chromosomes, which are more highly expressed and evolutionarily conserved, would have more harmful effects than mutations on <b>accessory</b> secondary <b>chromosomes.</b> Using a subset of eleven mutation accumulation isolates, each harboring between two and nine mutations, we show that the majority of mutations have minor deleterious effects, with a subset of those errors resulting in more drastic fitness declines. However, extending this study to more genotypes will be required to examine the relationship between particular mutation types and fitness. Ultimately, an enhanced understanding of the relationship between genotype and fitness will broaden our understanding of the distribution of mutational effects and elucidate the susceptibility of different genome regions to deleterious variation...|$|R
50|$|Although X {{chromosomes}} {{have been}} considered as hot spots for accumulating sexually antagonistic alleles, other autosomal locations have also been reported to harbor sexually antagonistic alleles. The XY, XX and ZW, ZZ system of sex determination allows accelerated fixation of alleles that are sex-linked recessive, male-beneficial and female-detrimental due to constant exposure to positive selection acting on heterogametic sex (XY, ZW) as compared to purifying selection removing the alleles only in homozygous state. In case of partial or completely dominant sex linked traits which are detrimental to male, the probability of selecting for the allele would be 2/3 as compared to selecting against probability of 1/3. Considering the above scenario its likely that X and W chromosomes would harbor many sexually antagonistic alleles. However, recently Innocenti et al. identified sexually antagonistic candidate genes in Drosophila melanogaster that contributed about 8% of the total genes. These were distributed on X, second and third <b>chromosomes.</b> <b>Accessory</b> gland proteins which are male biased and shows positive selection reside entirely on autosomes. They are partially sexually antagonistic as they are not expressed in females and dominant in nature and hence under represented on X.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The plant-pathogenic fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Fol) has <b>accessory,</b> lineage-specific (LS) <b>chromosomes</b> {{that can}} be {{transferred}} horizontally between strains. A single LS chromosome in the Fol 4287 reference strain harbors all known Fol effector genes. Transfer of this pathogenicity chromosome confers virulence to a previously non-pathogenic recipient strain. We hypothesize that expression and evolution of effector genes is influenced by their genomic context. RESULTS: To {{gain a better understanding}} of the genomic context of the effector genes, we manually curated the annotated genes on the pathogenicity chromosome and identified and classified transposable elements. Both retro- and DNA transposons are present with no particular overrepresented class. Retrotransposons appear evenly distributed over the chromosome, while DNA transposons tend to concentrate in large chromosomal subregions. In general, genes on the pathogenicity chromosome are dispersed within the repeat landscape. Effector genes are present within subregions enriched for DNA transposons. A miniature Impala (mimp) is always present in their promoters. Although promoter deletion studies of two effector gene loci did not reveal a direct function of the mimp for gene expression, we were able to use proximity to a mimp as a criterion to identify new effector gene candidates. Through xylem sap proteomics we confirmed that several of these candidates encode proteins secreted during plant infection. CONCLUSIONS: Effector genes in Fol reside in characteristic subregions on a pathogenicity chromosome. Their genomic context allowed us to develop a method for the successful identification of novel effector genes. Since our approach is not based on effector gene similarity, but on unique genomic features, it can easily be extended to identify effector genes in Fo strains with different host specificities...|$|R
40|$|Variations in {{chromosome}} number occur between and within individuals of many {{plant and animal}} species. In many cases differences are due to varying numbers of supernumerary, <b>accessory,</b> or B-type <b>chromosomes.</b> Supernumerary chromosomes are usually smaller than chromosomes of the basic set. They do not pair with chromosomes of the basic set and in many species they are reported to be heterochromatic. Some species have supernumeraries in somatic and reproductive tissues while others exhibit them only in reproductive tissues. The mode of transmission of supernumerary chromosomes varies in different species. Usually there is directed non-disjunction of the supernumeraries towards the gamete in pollen mitosis. In rye, however, there is directed non-disjunction of supernumeraries in both embryos and pollen grains. In some species directed non-disjunction is not observed. The origin of supernumerary chromosomes {{as well as their}} function remain to be elucidated in most species. It is believed that supernumeraries are genetically modified fragments of normal chromosomes. Some indications of a detrimental effect from supernumeraries have been obtained. Generally, however, they appear genetically inert. An examination of meiosis in crested wheatgrass (42) indicated a fairly high frequency of supernumeraries in plants of the tetraploid type. Summit and Nordan, varieties of the tetraploid type, and Fairway, a variety of diploid form, are used extensively as forage and seed crops in the drier parts of Western Canada. Extensive breeding programs, designed to improve both diploid and tetraploid forms of crested wheatgrass, are being conducted at the Forage Crops Section, Canada Department of Agriculture, Research Station, Saskatoon. Since supernumerary chromosomes occur with a high frequency in the Summit variety, and because this variety is characterized by low fertility, this study was initiated to determine the significance of supernumeraries in breeding of improved strains of crested wheatgrass. Investigations of the effect of supernumeraries on fertility were emphasized in particular. Combining ability of selected parents as shown by forage and seed yields of their progenies, was studied in relation to supernumeraries. In addition the present study was designed to investigate more fully the occurrence of supernumerary chromosomes in diploid and tetraploid species of crested wheatgrass and to determine their cytological behavior.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this project}} was to {{understand}} the mode of sex determination mechanism operates in chondrostean species. The following hypotheses were tested: i) white sturgeon has a genetic sex determination system, ii) one of the sexes in sturgeon is heterogametic, and iii) sex-specific DNA polymorphisms exist between the sexes. Several experimental approaches derived from the fields of transmission, molecular, and cytogenetics were used to examine the nature of the sex determination process. In the first series of experiments (Chapter 2) ploidy manipulation techniques were used  to produce gynogenetic and polyploid white sturgeon. A novel random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) -based technique was developed to rapidly assess the overall success of treatments designed to induce gynogenesis, and measuring erythrocyte nuclei size with a Coulter Counter was found to be a rapid and accurate technique for ploidy analysis in sturgeon. Both sexes were observed in 23 - 24 month old gynogenetic progeny groups derived from four different females supporting the hypothesis that white sturgeon has a female heterogametic (ZW:ZZ) genetic sex determination system. The proportion of males in diploid (48 %), gynogenetic (18 %), and triploid (14 %) progeny groups derived from the same female suggested that the sex-determining element on the W chromosome segregates independently of the centromere. In the second series of experiments (Chapter 3) various molecular techniques were used in an attempt to isolate genetic markers for the identification of sex in white sturgeon. Subtractive hybridization, representational difference analysis and bulked segregant analysis were used, in conjunction with genetically unique groups of sturgeon, which were specifically developed  to increase the probability of isolating sex-specific DNA sequences. DNA sequences associated with sex in white sturgeon were not identified. These results suggest that either 1) there are no sex-specific sequences in sturgeon, or 2) the sex-specific DNA is comprised of unusual sequences which were not complementary to the 1200 random decamer primers or the recognition sequence of the restriction endonucleases used in this set of experiments, or 3) the sex-specific sequences comprise a very small portion of the genome. Chapter 4  details a synaptonemal complex (SC) analysis of white sturgeon spermatocytes. Synaptonemal complex analyses have not been previously reported for any sturgeon species and this study was initiated to determine if it was possible to directly identify heteromorphic sex chromosomes in meiotic prophase SC spreads. No bivalent consistently exhibited asynaptic behavior or had axes of unequal length suggesting that heteromorphic sex chromosomes are not present in white sturgeon spermatocytes which concurs with the findings of Chapter 2. Pachytene nuclei had varying numbers of univalents, self-paired foldback elements with no obvious centromeric region (1 - 7), and other SC peculiarities. No consistent evidence of alignment or pairing involving more than two lateral elements was found indicating that the process of diploidization is now complete in this ancient polyploid. The SC number was 139 (± 3. 4) with both between and within animal variation. The final series of experiments (Chapter 5) involved mitotic analyses of metaphase chromosome spreads from four white sturgeon individuals of each sex. Conventional mitotic analyses provided no evidence for a heteromorphic sex chromosome pair or any sex-related chromosomal polymorphism. Likewise fluorescence in situ hybridization of labeled male and female sturgeon genomic DNA to metaphase chromosome spreads of each sex did not reveal a chromosome that was seen to be specifically hybridizing only to the genomic DNA of one sex. The average chromosome number was 271 (range 265 - 276) which concurred with the meiotic count found in Chapter 4. An  improved C-banding technique using propidium iodide and epifluorescence microscopy revealed between animal variation (2 - 7) in the number of entirely heterochromatic metacentric chromosomes. These heterochromatic chromosomes and the self-pairing elements observed in  Chapter 4 were approximately equal in number and relative size and they may represent <b>accessory</b> B <b>chromosomes.</b>  In combination these results suggest that white sturgeon has a female heterogametic ZW:ZZ genetic sex determination system, and that the sex-determining element segregates independently ofthe centromere. No evidence of a heteromorphic sex chromosome pair was found in meiotic analyses of white sturgeon spermatocytes supporting the hypothesis of male homogamety in this species.  The inability to identify sex-specific DNA sequences despite evidence of a genetic sex determination system suggests that sex-specific DNA is rare, making up a very small portion of the genome. Mitotic analyses provided no evidence for a heteromorphic sex chromosome pair suggesting that the accumulation of sex chromosomal rearrangements is insufficient to be visible at the cytogenetic level. All of these results support the contention that white sturgeon sex chromosomes are at an early stage of differentiation...|$|R
