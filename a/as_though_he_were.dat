5|$|According to Hossein Nasr, the {{earliest}} European literature often refers to Muhammad unfavorably. A few learned circles of Middle Ages Europeprimarily Latin-literate scholarshad access to fairly extensive biographical material about Muhammad. They interpreted the biography through a Christian religious filter; one that viewed Muhammad {{as a person}} who seduced the Saracens into his submission under religious guise. Popular European literature of the time portrayed Muhammad <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> worshipped by Muslims, similar to an idol or a heathen god.|$|E
5|$|By late 1943, Miller {{has been}} based at RAF South Cerny in Gloucestershire. One night, he was pulled over by his {{commanding}} officer, whom he detested, for not wearing his uniform cap. An altercation resulted, and Miller posed <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> about to punch his officer. The result was that Miller was charged with insubordination and sentenced to a three-week disciplinary course with hard labour, from 18 October to 9 November. In mid-November he was posted to Ouston near Newcastle upon Tyne where he was trained {{in the use of}} radar using Anson and Oxford aircraft. During his stay there, Miller was thrown on his back during a wrestling match, sustaining an injury that caused him recurring problems in later years, diminishing his ability to bowl.|$|E

25|$|Nicholson {{was born}} in {{suburban}} East London and lived on Hackney Road as a child. He was orphaned at a young age, and moved to Islington to be raised by his two sisters, who ran a school there. They raised him <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> a child of their own. The income from the school allowed them to live a comfortable lifestyle. He was taught by Henry Butter, a well-respected author who had written a much-read treatise on teaching spelling. As a child, Nicholson was fascinated by clowns, and often spent time watching them. Nicholson moved to Shadwell as a young man, and began working as an apprentice to a pawnbroker.|$|E
25|$|A clown is seen {{walking with}} Graziosa, the gypsy chief's daughter. A gypsy tells {{the chief of}} the {{approach}} of Don Quixote. The chief plans a trick for his benefit and, putting on a mantle crown, sits down <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> a king on a throne. Don Quixote is deceived and kneels to the chief in homage. The chief bids that he sit beside him and orders a festival to be given in his honor. This begins with Gypsy dances and is followed by a performance of the marionette theatre. Don Quixote is delighted with the entertainment but, mistaking the heroine for his Dulcinea and the marionettes for soldiers attacking her, he rises to assault them. The gypsies are terrified. At this moment the clown and Graziosa run away.|$|E

25|$|Although Thomas Le Fanu {{tried to}} live <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> well-off, {{the family was}} in {{constant}} financial difficulty. Thomas took the rectorships {{in the south of}} Ireland for the money, as they provided a decent living through tithes. However, from 1830, as the result of agitation against the tithes, this income began to fall and it ceased entirely two years later. In 1838 the government instituted a scheme of paying rectors a fixed sum, but in the interim the Dean had little besides rent on some small properties he had inherited. In 1833 Thomas had to borrow £100 from his cousin Captain Dobbins (who himself ended up in the debtors' prison a few years later) to visit his dying sister in Bath, who was also deeply in debt over her medical bills. At his death Thomas had almost nothing to leave to his sons and the family had to sell his library to pay off some of his debts. His widow went to stay with the younger son William.|$|E
25|$|Sir Eglamour's {{young son}} {{is not the}} only baby to be carried off by this mythical bird in medieval romance. The baby son of the Roman Emperor Octavian is seized, first of all by a lioness and then by a griffin, in the medieval romance Octavian. Lioness and baby are both carried to a distant isle by this flying creature, where the lioness is safely deposited, kills and eats the griffin and suckles the young boy <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> her cub. Lioness and baby are accidentally found by the boy's mother, who travels on with them both into exile in the Middle East. Her other son, who was seized by an ape {{at the same time that}} his brother was seized by the lioness and then the griffin, {{journeys}} to a new life as Florent, the son of a Paris merchant. As in the tale Sir Eglamour of Artois, mother and son in Octavian are finally reunited after many years apart, and a giant is defeated during the unfolding of the tale.|$|E

500|$|The expedition's hut, a {{prefabricated}} structure measuring 33 x 19feet (10m x 5.8m), {{was ready}} for occupation {{by the end of}} February. It was divided into a series of mainly two-person cubicles, with a kitchen area, a darkroom, storage and laboratory space. The ponies were housed in stalls built on the most sheltered side of the hut, while the dog kennels were placed close to the porch. Shackleton's inclusive leadership style, in contrast to that of Scott, meant no demarcation between upper and lower decks—all lived, worked and ate together. Morale was high; as assistant geologist Philip Brocklehurst recorded, Shackleton [...] "had a faculty for treating each member of the expedition <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> valuable to it".|$|E
500|$|During {{the days}} that followed, Sackville Street and {{particularly}} {{the area around the}} Pillar became a battleground. According to some histories, insurgents attempted to blow up the Pillar. The accounts are unconfirmed and were disputed by many that fought in the Rising, {{on the grounds that the}} Pillar's large base provided them with useful cover as they moved to and from other rebel positions. [...] By Thursday night, British artillery fire had set much of Sackville Street ablaze, but according to the writer Peter De Rosa's account: [...] "On his pillar, Nelson surveyed it all serenely, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> lit up by a thousand lamps". The statue was visible against the fiery backdrop from as far as Killiney, [...] away.|$|E
500|$|Rubinstein was {{impressed}} by Tchaikovsky's musical talent on the whole and cited him as [...] "a composer of genius" [...] in his autobiography. He was less pleased with the more progressive tendencies of some of Tchaikovsky's student work. Nor did he change his opinion as Tchaikovsky's reputation grew. He and Zaremba clashed with Tchaikovsky when he submitted his First Symphony for performance by the RMS in Saint Petersburg. Rubinstein and Zaremba refused to consider the work unless substantial changes were made. Tchaikovsky complied but they still refused to perform the symphony. Tchaikovsky, distressed {{that he had been}} treated <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> still their student, withdrew the symphony. It was given its first complete performance, minus the changes Rubinstein and Zaremba had requested, in Moscow in February 1868.|$|E

500|$|As Madonna {{considered}} her alternatives, producers Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray were experimenting with instrumental tracks and musical ideas for her consideration. Both {{of them wanted}} to bring their unique style to the project, and composed music for the title track. Eventually, Madonna felt that the music presented to her by Leonard was more interesting, and she started to work with him. Once Madonna had conceptualized the way she would interpose her ideas with the music, she wrote [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] in about three hours. Writing and producing it with Leonard, it became the first song developed for the album. The singer has described [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] as the song of a passionate young girl [...] "so in love with God that it is almost <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>He</b> <b>were</b> the male figure in her life." ...|$|E
500|$|McCann {{notes that}} one of the reasons that Grant was so {{successful}} with his film career is that he was not conscious of how handsome he was on screen, acting in a fashion which was most unexpected and unusual from a Hollywood star of that period. George Cukor once stated: [...] "You see, he didn't depend on his looks. He wasn't a narcissist, he acted <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> just an ordinary young man. And that made it all the more appealing, that a handsome young man was funny; that was especially unexpected and good because we think, 'Well, if he's a Beau Brummel, he can't be either funny or intelligent', but he proved otherwise". Jennifer Grant acknowledged that her father neither relied on his looks nor was a character actor, and said that he was just the opposite of that, playing the [...] "basic man".|$|E
500|$|Colbert {{spoke in}} the persona of the {{character}} he played on Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, a parody of a conservative pundit in the fashion of Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity. He began by satirizing mass surveillance, joking [...] "If anybody needs anything else at their tables, just speak slowly and clearly into your table numbers. Someone from the NSA will be right over with a cocktail." [...] While many of his jokes were directed at President Bush, he also lampooned the journalists and other figures present at the dinner. Most of the speech was prepared specifically for the event, but several segments were lifted—largely unchanged—from The Colbert Report, including parts of the [...] "truthiness" [...] monologue from the first episode of the show, where Colbert advocated speaking from [...] "the gut" [...] rather than the brain and denounced books as [...] "all fact, no heart". Colbert framed {{this part of the}} speech <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> agreeing with Bush's philosophies, saying that he and Bush are [...] "not brainiacs on the nerd patrol", implicitly criticizing the way Bush positioned himself as an anti-intellectual.|$|E

500|$|Shooting Schindler's List {{was deeply}} {{emotional}} for Spielberg, {{the subject matter}} forcing him to confront elements of his childhood, such as the antisemitism he faced. He was surprised {{that he did not}} cry while visiting Auschwitz; instead he found himself filled with outrage. He was one of many crew members who could not force themselves to watch during shooting of the scene where aging Jews are forced to run naked while being selected by Nazi doctors to go to Auschwitz. Spielberg commented that he felt more like a reporter than a film maker – he would set up scenes and then watch events unfold, almost <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> witnessing them rather than creating a movie. Several actresses broke down when filming the shower scene, including one who was born in a concentration camp. Spielberg, his wife Kate Capshaw, and their five children rented a house in suburban Kraków for the duration of filming. He later thanked his wife [...] "for rescuing me ninety-two days in a row... when things just got too unbearable". Robin Williams called Spielberg to cheer him up, given the profound lack of humor on the set. Spielberg spent several hours each evening editing Jurassic Park, which was scheduled to premiere in June 1993.|$|E
500|$|Feeling <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> [...] "constantly {{trying to}} prove myself", Beck {{suffered}} a backlash, with skeptics denouncing him as a self-indulgent fake and the latest marketing opportunity. In the summer of 1994, Beck was struggling {{and many of his}} fellow musicians thought he had lost his way. Combined with the song's wildly popular music video and the world tour, Beck reacted believing the attention could not last, resulting in a status as a [...] "one-hit wonder". At other concerts, crowds were treated to twenty minutes of reggae or Miles Davis or jazz-punk iterations of [...] "Loser". At one-day festivals in California, he surrounded himself with an artnoise combo. The drummer set fire to his cymbals; the lead guitarist [...] "played" [...] his char with the strings faced towards his body; and Beck changed the words to [...] "Loser" [...] so that nobody could sing along. [...] "I can't tell you how many times I was looking at faces that were looking back at me with complete bewilderment—or just pointing and shaking their heads and laughing—while performing during that period," [...] he later recalled. Despite this, Beck gained the respect of his peers, such as Tom Petty and Johnny Cash, and created an entire wave of bands determined to recapture the Mellow Gold sound. Feeling his previous releases were just collections of demos recorded {{over the course of several}} years, Beck desired to enter the studio and record an album in a continuous linear fashion, which became Odelay.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} {{match was}} against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were almost a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. Bradman chose Barnes and Morris as his preferred opening pair, while Brown continued out of position in the middle order. Barring one change in the bowling department, the same team lined up in the First Test, with the top six batsmen in the same position. For players on both sides, {{it was a chance}} to gain a psychological advantage ahead of the Tests. Australia won the toss and batted and Morris fell with the score at 1/11. Barnes added 160 for the next wicket with Bradman before falling for 81 with the score at 2/171. Bradman's men went on to amass 552 and bowled out the hosts for 189 and 205 to win by an innings; Barnes caught John Deighton and Jack Robertson and took 0/15 from four overs. [...] During the match, Barnes again gained attention for placing himself extremely close to the batsman when fielding at short leg, with one foot {{on the edge of the}} cut strip. [...] According to retired Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton, himself a former fielder in the leg trap, [...] " [...] was the closest I have ever seen any fieldsman on the leg side". Bradman had suggested Barnes do so when leading English batsman Len Hutton was playing, in an attempt to distract or intimidate him. Barnes later claimed he was at little risk as Hutton was reluctant to hook Australia's pace bowlers towards him and preferred to duck bowling aimed at his upper body. He said Hutton often talked pessimistically to teammates and that the Australians would benefit if they dampened Hutton's confidence. Although Hutton top-scored in both innings, scoring 52 and 64, Barnes said the batsman's eyes betrayed discomfort. The theatrical Barnes also decided to test the umpire's patience by hovering his foot over the pitch, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> about to place it down on the batting surface, which {{was against the}} laws of cricket. Umpire Frank Chester, who was also known for his flamboyance and penchant for making himself visible, at one point held up proceedings momentarily when Barnes feigned to put his foot on the surface as the bowler was preparing to deliver the ball.|$|E
