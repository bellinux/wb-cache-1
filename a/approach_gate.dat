500|$|The temple, {{the largest}} in the region is built in Vijayanagara style of architecture, in the [...] "Sandhara" [...] order within a {{rectangular}} yard enclosed by walls. The temple, located [...] from Siddhout via Bakarapeta, is architecturally elegant and impressive. It has three ornate Gopurams (towers) of which the central tower, which faces east, is the entrance gateway to the temple; the other two towers face north and south. This central tower is built in five tiers, and a number of steps are provided to access the <b>approach</b> <b>gate</b> of the tower.|$|E
5000|$|An {{additional}} {{contributing factor}} {{to the crash}} was an error {{on the part of}} the radar controller. Procedure for runway 25 was to direct flights to intercept the final approach at 8 nmi, with the <b>approach</b> <b>gate</b> at 6 nmi. The controller misjudged the aircraft's distance and turned it to final inside the recommended distance, resulting in the aircraft being on final approach vector at about 4.5 nmi, close to half the distance of a normal approach. The NTSB report concludes the controller [...] "created a situation that would make it impossible for the captain to configure his aircraft in the manner specified in the flight manual".|$|E
40|$|Metering and spacing (M & S) system's {{algorithms}} described assume {{an aircraft}} two dimensional are navigation capability. The three navigation systems compared were: {{very high frequency}} omnidirectional range/distance measuring equipment (VOR/DME) and ILS, VOR/DME and + or - 40 MLS, and VOR/DME and + or - 60 MLS. Other factors studied were M & S tentative schedule point location, route geometry effects, and <b>approach</b> <b>gate</b> location effects. Summarized results are: the MLS offers some improvement over VOR/DME and ILS if all approach routes contain computer assisted turns; pilot reaction to moving the gate closer to the runway threshold may adversely affect M & S performance; and coupling en route metering to terminal scheduling transfers most of the terminal holding to more full efficient, higher altitude en route delay...|$|E

40|$|Operation of {{flood barrier}} gates is {{sometimes}} hampered by flow-induced vibrations. Although the physics is understood for specific gate types, it remains challenging to judge dynamic gate behaviour for unanticipated conditions. This paper presents a hybrid modelling system for predicting vibrations by combining machine learning with physics-based modelling so that critical situations can be avoided. In the outlined data-driven <b>approach</b> <b>gate</b> response data is acquired by sensors {{and stored in}} a database. For an underflow gate under submerged flow conditions, gate opening and "reduced velocity" are the attributes for classification into safe and unsafe situations. Results from physical scale model tests are used to illustrate the proposed technique. A finite-element model for computational fluid-structure interaction simulations, presently under development, is applied to provide complementary input to the system’s database. The system described in this paper contributes to safer gate control and can become a useful aid in flood barrier management...|$|E
40|$|A 4 D area {{navigation}} system {{was designed to}} guide aircraft along a prespecified flight path (reference path) such that the aircraft would arrive at the <b>approach</b> <b>gate</b> at a time specified by the ATC controller. Key components to achieve this requirement were: (1) stored reference trajectories; (2) a continuously recomputed capture trajectory to a selected waypoint on the reference trajectory so as to achieve the desired time of arrival; (3) electronic situation displays; and (4) a control system to follow the overall trajectory in space and time. The system was implemented in a digital integrated avionics system (STOLAND) installed on a CV- 340 airplane. Although the 4 D system was designed primarily for automatic operation, it was flight tested in a flight director mode (the pilot follows the flight director commands), because the CV- 340 autopilot servos were not tied to the avionics system. The flight test showed that, even in the flight director mode, the pilot did achieve the objectives of path tracking and time of arrival control with only moderate workload. The system also permitted controlled delay {{of the time of}} arrival by path stretching, which takes advantage of the continuously changing capture trajectory to predict the time of arrival. Simulations in the automatic and manual modes were used to complement the flight data...|$|E

50|$|This led to Detroit's Unemployed Council {{organizing}} the Ford Hunger March. On March 7, 1932 some 3,000 - 5,000 unemployed workers assembled in West Detroit to march on Ford's River Rouge plant {{to deliver a}} petition demanding more support. As the march moved up Miller Road and <b>approached</b> <b>Gate</b> 3 the protest turned ugly. The police fired tear gas into the crowd and fire trucks were used to soak the protesters with icy water. When the protesters responded by throwing rocks, the violence escalated rapidly and culminated in the police and plant security guards firing live rounds through {{the gates of the}} plant at the unarmed protesters. Four men were killed outright and a fifth died later in the hospital. Up to 60 more were seriously injured.|$|R
