40|$|This paper {{provides}} results {{related to}} the optimal design of unpaced production lines. It has been shown previously that unbalancing an unpaced production line in an appropriate way will increase its production rate. Results are presented here which show how the optimal allocation of work between stations changes with respect to [...] the number of work stations in the line, [...] the limit {{on the amount of}} work-in-progress, and [...] the variance of station operation times. [...] An analysis of results given here demonstrate the following system characteristics. When the number of stations in the production line increases, the average <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>unbalance</b> in the optimal allocation remains about the same, but the increase in mean production rate obtained by using the optimal allocation rather than the balanced line becomes substantially larger. If the operation times are highly variable (exponential distribution), the effect of increasing in-process storage space is to substantially decrease the average <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>unbalance</b> in the optimal allocation but to only slightly decrease the resulting improvement over the balanced line. If the amount of in-process storage space is very small, the effect of decreasing the variability of operation times is to decrease these same quantities but at a surprisingly slow rate. On the other hand, the effect of simultaneously increasing in-process storage space and decreasing the variability of operation times is to very rapidly decrease both the optimal unbalance and the resulting improvement. The model used to characterize an unpaced production line system is the classical queueing system with finite queues in series. inventory/production: stochastic systems, production/scheduling: line balancing, queues...|$|E
40|$|A {{new type}} of {{balancing}} machine is proposed which uses a dynamic vibration absorber as a device measuring unbalance. When an unbalanced rotor rotates, centrifugal forces are generated which result in sinusoidal forces being transmitted to the supporting structure.

When it is tuned to resonate at the test rotational speed, the structure does not move at all; the auxiliary system vibrates {{in such a way that}} the phase angle between the displacement of auxiliary mass and the sinusoidal force is exactly 180 degrees and that the product of the auxiliary mass and the amplitude of its vibration is equal to the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>unbalance.</b> Therefore, the motion of the auxiliary mass provides sufficient information for balancing the rotor.

40|$|Abstract. This {{study was}} focused on the {{theoretical}} modeling and numerical simulation about the unbalanced response for coupled double-rotor spindle system of high speed grinder. Based on the rotor dynamics, a theoretical model was established using the transfer matrix method. The moment balance equations, and the transition matrix, the state vector, field matrix of coupled double-rotor spindle system of high speed grinder were analyzed and calculated. The numerical results showed that the amplitude of unbalance response increased by the same multiple as that of the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>unbalance</b> at different locations and at different speeds. Furthermore, the position most sensitive to the unbalance was the front end of rotor 2, followed by the middle and back end of rotor 2. Rotor 2 was especially sensitive to unbalance. Moreover, the vibration amplitudes of the front end, front and back bearings of rotor 1 increased in response to unbalanced increase of rotate speed. The vibration amplitude abruptly increased at 17500 r/min corresponding to first-order critical speed...|$|E

Tests were performed on a machinery fault simulator under various conditions <b>of</b> <b>unbalance.</b> Vibration data was simul-taneously acquired using a multi-channel data acquisition system. Since unbalance produces a change in the ODS at the rotor running speed and its harmonics, this data was extracted from frequency domain functions which were cal-culated from acquired acceleration data. An ODS comparison was then performed at the running speed and its harmonics. The emphasis is on correlating changes in the ODS at the machine harmonics with various <b>amounts</b> and locations <b>of</b> <b>unbalance</b> weight.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model of a}} symmetric rotor supported by one rigid and one fluid lubricated bearing is proposed. The rotor model is represented by generalized (modal) parameters of its first bending mode. The rotational character of the bearing fluid force is taken into account. The model yields synchronous vibrations due to rotor unbalance as a particular solution of the equations of motion, rotor/bearing system natural frequencies and corresponding self-excited vibrations known as oil whirl and oil whip. The stability analysis yields rotative speed threshold of stability. The model also gives the evaluation of stability of the rotor synchronous vibrations. In the first balance resonance speed region two more thresholds of stability are yielded.

40|$|Some {{unbalance}} either inherent or induced {{is always}} to be expected in automobile wheels. It may be inherent due to imperfect balancing of the wheel {{or it may be}} induced by the uneven wear of the tires. While in motion this unbalance simultaneously sets up two vibrations in the wheel, one a linear vibration normal to the road and the other an angular vibration about the king pin. The frequency of these vibrations depends on the forward speed of the vehicle and when it coincides with the natural frequency of vibration of the wheels the well known phenomenon of resonance occurs. The research reported in this thesis is a systematic investigation of this phenomenon in one front wheel of an automobile with the other three wheels in true balance. Known amounts of unbalance (both static and dynamic) were introduced into the left front wheel and road tests were conducted over a range of speeds covering resonance. Vibration pickups on the wheels recorded both vertical and angular displacement as a function of speed. Response curves have been plotted with the amount and type of unbalance as parameters. Also an attempt has been made to establish some bounds for the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>unbalance</b> that are noticeable to the passengers while traveling through the range of resonance...|$|E
40|$|Loosening of a {{rotating}} part from its fixed {{position on the}} shaft or {{a part of the}} stator which comes loose and begins to turn with the rotor very frequently represents machinery malfunction. The loose part becomes involved in rotative motion mostly due to dry or fluid friction, and thus its motion is very erratic. The loose part can also move axially along the shaft. Detachment of the rotating part causes changes in the rotor balance state. Most often this results in higher unbalance. During steady-state operation the effect of a loose rotating part can manifest itself through heat vibration. It can be diagnosed by observing periodic changes of amplitude and phase of the synchronous response. During start-up (or shutdown) a loose rotating part carrying some <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>unbalance</b> may manifest its dynamic action in the form of subsynchronous vibrations, very similar to those of other instabilities. The objective of this demonstration is to observe the effect of a loose rotating part (fixed, however, in the axial direction) under both steady-state (rotor constant speed) and transient (rotor start-up or shutdown) operation. The dynamic response depends very much on the amount of damping in the system: lubrication of the loose part/shaft surfaces and addition/elimination of aerodynamic drag blades, mounted on the loose disk, significantly change the rotor response...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 81 Excessive rotor {{vibrations}} {{are one of}} {{the leading}} causes of damage to pump components, particularly to bearings, shaft seals, and premature wear of labyrinth surfaces. Under an EPRI contract which was awarded to Sulzer in 1983, a full scale three-stage test pump was built which has been extensively tested for rotordynamic behavior. Design conditions selected for this pump are typical for fossil plants with subcritical steam generation. The pump was installed in a closed loop. To investigate rotordynamic behavior experimentally, the pump had to be equipped with sophisticated instrumentation including shaft vibration measurements within the pump. The influence of different parameters such as labyrinth clearances, <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>unbalance,</b> swirl brakes, and flowrate is described. Experimental results (i. e., unbalance response) are compared with analytical results using a rotordynamic code based on finite element approach. In boiler feed pump systems, for a number of reasons, sudden loss of suction pressure can occur. In such cases, vaporization in the pump occurs accompanied by two phase flow conditions, large hydraulic forces, loss of damping, high rotor amplitudes, with possible contact between rotor and stator. This condition was simulated with the test loop. The influence of such a loss of suction incident on pump behavior, especially shaft vibrations, is described. The conclusions highlight the importance of the labyrinths on rotordynamic behavior, in particular the influence of swirl brakes to reduce shaft vibration amplitudes. If the analytical results have to compare well with measured vibrations, excellent quantitative knowledge of bearing, labyrinth and impeller interaction dynamic coefficients is essential...|$|E
40|$|To run both {{smoothly}} and efficiently, high-speed machines need stable, low friction bearings {{to support their}} rotor. Being oil-free, self-acting gas film bearings are often the choice in high speed rotating machinery. Although plain aerostatic journal bearings carry more load and have superior lift characteristics, they suffer from instability problems, and one can add grooves to 'increase that stability. The research describe a mathematical model developed for small eccentricities, to predict the steady state and stability of enhanced capacity air bearings which combine external pressurisation and aerodynamic effects by adding grooves. This theory was than tested in a practical bearing design application. With {{the aid of a}} computer program geometry and thus load capacity, stiffness and stability were optimised. A prototype bearing based on a standard aerostatic bearing spindle, was designed, produced and tested. Stiffness, load capacity, pressure distribution and stability were monitored experimentally. The effects of the attitude angle on stability are discussed and it is concluded that the attitude angle is an unreliable predictor of bearing stability. Experimental dynamic stability studies have been carried out and the initial bearing spindle was operated with known <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>unbalance</b> at speeds up to 105000 rpm, with a gas supply pressure of 6 bar. The spindle vibration amplitude was measured and coherence data and dynamic compliance functions of the bearing were determined. The critical speeds were determined by monitoring the natural frequency amplitudes of the bearing spindle. Having observed some positive dynamic benefits of a prototype hybrid spindle, the work was followed up with a further test on a hybrid spindle with improved bearing geometry. The natural frequencies were observed, and the critical speeds determined. The bearing successfully reached the maximum 120000 rpm speed predicted by the theoretical model for the bearing design, and at all speed the spindle remained stable. The main contribution is in improved stability and increased speed capacity of a hybrid externally pressurised bearing by adding optimised geometry grooves which further enhanced the control of pressure distribution for bearings used in high speed spindle applications...|$|R
50|$|Dynamic balance {{describes}} the forces generated by asymmetric mass distribution when the tire is rotated, usually {{at a high}} speed. In the tire factory, the tire and wheel are mounted on a balancing machine test wheel, the assembly is accelerated up to a speed of 100 RPM (10 to 15 mph with recent high sensitivity sensors) or higher, 300 RPM (55 to 60 mph with typical low sensitivity sensors), and forces <b>of</b> <b>unbalance</b> are measured by sensors as the tire rotates. These forces are resolved into static and couple values for {{the inner and outer}} planes of the wheel, and compared to the unbalance tolerance (the maximum allowable manufacturing limits). If the tire is not checked, {{it has the potential to}} wobble and perform poorly. In tire retail shops, tire/wheel assemblies are checked on a spin-balancer, which determines the <b>amount</b> and angle <b>of</b> <b>unbalance.</b> Balance weights are then fitted to the outer and inner flanges of the wheel.

40|$|In {{practical}} power systems, it {{is normally}} impossible to maintain perfect balance or symmetry in phase voltages and currents. The {{diversity of the}} load, such as single phase, arc furnaces and railway, enhances the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>unbalance</b> or negative sequence components. Alongside asymmetrical load, further increase in negative sequence components is introduced due to the network inherent asymmetry i. e. untransposed transmission. Thus, they are usually excessive and exceeds standards at weak nodes in the network. Utilities and customers have to comply certain code agreements to limit the degree of negative sequence components in the network. This is because that negative sequence components cause deterioration to the network equipments. For instance, higher loss, torque oscillation, speed reduction and excessive rotor heat are undesirable obstacles to rotating machines. Asymmetrical load compensator can be based on passive elements, i. e. inductors and capacitors such as a Static Var Compensator (SVC), or a Voltage Source Converter (VSC) such as a Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM). The utilization of the negative sequence controller, an SVC or a STATCOM provides, gains a significant interest to most utilities around the globe. The compensators basically inject a different capacitive or inductive negative sequence current that has an opposite phase of the load negative sequence current. As a result, the network see symmetrical load and phase voltages and currents are balanced without exchanging active power between the network and the compensator. The thesis investigates {{the benefits of the}} SVC negative sequence controller to a network with a detailed description about the SVC characteristics and control components. The thesis also presents unbalance assessment methods implemented in practical networks during the planning stage. Moreover, drawbacks of negative sequence components to network apparatus i. e. rotating machines and transmission lines are summarized. The analysis is carried out using PSCAD for a simple network representation and IEEE 14 bus system. The result illustrates that the SVC allows utilities to balance asymmetrical loads to mitigate negative sequence components. The SVC response to balance asymmetrical load depends on load type, network strength and sources of unbalance. The SVC exhibits a very fast response to reduce the negative sequence components in extreme cases of unbalance such as asymmetrical short circuit. The SVC in general can mitigate negative sequence components caused by a sources connected in the same bus which means that the SVC provides local balancing only. Besides the negative sequence controller, the SVC enable a power factor correction by compensating for the reactive components of the load positive sequence current...|$|E
30|$|The actual {{rotor system}} {{can have a}} varying degree of {{nonlinearity}} and could often be a multi-fault system; the assumption of single fault rotor system may be an idealistic situation. For example, a rotor system can always have some <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>unbalance,</b> misalignment in the driveline, temporary bow, etc. However, these can be within the permissible limits. Furthermore, these initial drawbacks or faults may excite one or more faults in the system under such circumstances. For example, rotor might develop contact with the stationary parts under tighter clearances or rotor could develop fatigue crack under severe thermal and mechanical stresses [2]. These two important rotor faults, i.e., fatigue crack and rotor-stator rub, could lead to catastrophic failure, if undetected. Many researches have been made on fault diagnosis of crack and rotor-stator rub. Zhou et al. [3] studied the nonlinear dynamical behavior of a horizontal Jeffcott rotor system with a transverse crack. They used a new acceleration scheme to reduce shocks to the rotor and diagnose the existence of cracks. Sabnavis et al. [4] made extensive reviews {{of the literature on}} vibration characteristics of cracked rotor shaft. Muszynska [5, 6] made excellent researches and reviews on rotor-stator contacting phenomenon and rub-related diagnostics. She found contacting interaction between rotor and stator is manifested by {{one or more of the}} physical phenomena, i.e., friction, impacting, and stiffening, depending upon system parameters and operating conditions, different types of rubbing conditions prevail. Feng and Zhang [7] studied vibration response of a rotor rubbing caused by an initial perturbation. They discussed influence of various parameters on the vibration phenomena of the rotor system. Chu and Lu [8] observed very rich form of periodic and chaotic vibrations in their experimental study. They found that besides harmonic components 2 × and 3 ×, the 1 / 2 fractional harmonic components such as 1 / 2 ×, 3 / 2 ×, etc., and the 1 / 3 fractional harmonic components such as 1 / 3 ×, 2 / 3 ×, etc., are also present in some of the cases. Patel and Darpe [2] pointed out that higher levels of vibration due to crack in a rotor may develop rotor-stator rubbing in tight clearance situation. Therefore, this study is aimed to examine one multi-faults case in which three faults, i.e., unbalance, transverse fatigue crack, and rotor-stator rub, are simulated together, and the effect of presence of multiple faults is studied. In recent past, only a few research studies have addressed this issue. Based on the model-based diagnostic approaches, Bachschmid and Pennacchi [9] and Platz et al. [10] studied multiple faults identification of rotor system. Darpe [11] applied the signal-based approach for analysis on the vibration response of the rotor system with crack and asymmetry faults together. Recently, Patel and Darpe [2, 12] have numerically and experimentally investigated the rotor vibration characteristics of the unbalance, crack, and rotor-stator rub faults, using both classical Jeffcott rotor model and Timoshenko beam element, considering both lateral and torsional degrees of freedom.|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Dönel hareket yapan sistemler, dengesiz yük olması durumunda dönmenin etkisi altında merkezkaç kuvvetine maruz kalırlar. Dengesizlik hali merkezkaç kuvvetlerinin etkisi ile çoğu zaman istenmeyen titreşimlere neden olur. Bu titreşimler ve merkezkaç kuvveti, gürültü ve enerji kaybı olarak kendini gösterirken, dönen sistemlerin yataklarının aşınmasına neden olmakta, sistemin çalışma ömrünü ve performansını azaltmaktadır. Tüm bunları kontrol etmek, düşük enerji tüketimi sağlayıp ürün kalitesini arttırmak ve dengesizliğin kabul edilebilir sınırları aşmamasını sağlamak için titreşim seviyelerinin kontrol altında tutulması için şarttır. Titreşimleri oluşturan en önemli parametrelerden biri olan dönel sistemlerdeki dengesizlik etkisi, turbo makinalarda, çamaşır makinalarında, makina tezgâhlarında ve elektrik motorlarında büyük önem taşır. Bu tez çalışmasında, makinalarda dengesizlik problemi ele alınmış, genel olarak dengeleme yöntemleri hakkında bilgi toplanmış ve tez konusu olan sıvı halkalı sistemlerle pasif dengeleme hakkında kapsamlı bir literatür araştırması yapılmış, sıvı dengeleme halkaları ile dengeleme yapan sistemlerin çalışma prensibi incelenmiştir. Ardından, klasik dengeleme yöntemleri ve sıvı halkalı sistemlerle pasif dengeleme konularında teorik bilgiler derlenmiş ve sunulmuştur. Söz konusu sıvı halkalı sistemlerin bir modelinin ortaya konması, analiz yönteminin geliştirilmesi ve sistemin {{optimize}} edilebilmesi için gerekli araçların geliştirilmesi amaçlanmıştır. Sıvılı dengeleme sistemleri, dönel bir sistemin üzerine yerleştirilen, ona bağlı olarak hareket eden, içi belli bir hacimsel oranda sıvı ile doldurulmuş olan halkanın içerisindeki sıvının, merkezkaç kuvveti etkisiyle dengesizliğin aksi yönünde konumlanması prensibi ile çalışan sistemlerdir. Halka içerisinde yer alan sıvı, sistemin dönme merkezini referans alarak konumlanır ve dengesizliğin karşı tarafında konumlanan sıvının meydana getirdiği merkezkaç kuvveti, dengesizliğin sebep olduğu merkezkaç kuvvetinin bir kısmını kompanse eder. Sıvı halkalı sistemlerle pasif dengeleme, genellikle ilgilenilen frekans aralığında rijid olarak davranan, ancak izolasyon veya askı sistemleri nedeni ile makinanın çalışma hızının sistemin ilk doğal frekansının üzerinde olduğu durumlarda etkin olmaktadır. Bir başka deyişle, dengesizlikten kaynaklanan kuvvet ile deplasman cinsinden oluşan titreşimler arasında 180 o’lik bir faz farkı oluştuğu durumlarda sıvı halkalı dengeleme sistemleri kullanılabilmektedir. Belirtilen bu kısıta bağlı kalınmak üzere bu tez kapsamında sıvı dengeleme halkalarının tek ve çok katmanlı modelleri MATLAB ortamında oluşturulmuş ve bu modeller doğrultusunda bir analiz yöntemi geliştirilmiştir. Bu modellerde kullanılan temel yaklaşım, verilen bir dengesizlik ortamında halka veya halkalar içerisinde bulunan sıvının halka veya halkalar içinde nasıl konumlanacağının ve sıvının ters yönde yaratacağı dengeleme kuvvetlerinin belirlenmesidir. Bu prensibe dayanarak sistemin dengeleme kapasitesini belirlemek xiv mümkündür ve verilen bir dengesizlik durumu için sistemi optimize edecek araçlar bu tez kapsamında geliştirilmiştir. Dengeleme halkası tasarımında etkin olan parametreler ortaya konmuş, oluşturulan modeller kullanılarak sayısal simülasyonlar gerçekleştirilmiş, yapılan analizler ve optimizasyonlar çerçevesinde sonuçlar karşılaştırılmıştır. Sıvı halkalı dengeleme sistemi dengesizliği azaltmak için kullanılabilir ve bu sistemin görevini yapabilmesi için makinada net olarak bir miktar dengesizlik veya eksentrisite olması şarttır. Verilen bir titreşim seviyesi (eksantrisite) durumunda sıvının halka veya halkalar içindeki konumu iteratif bir yöntemle belirlenmiştir. Ancak, gerçek uygulamalarda titreşim seviyesi değil, sistemdeki olası dengesizlik miktarı bilinmekte ve pasif dengeleme sisteminin de bu koşulda analiz edilmesi gerekmektedir. Bu durum, analizler sırasında iterasyon döngüsü içinde başka bir iterasyon döngüsünü gerektirmektedir. Geliştirilen analiz yöntemi bu koşulda da sıvının konumunu ve pasif dengeleme sonucu titreşim seviyesinin ne kadar azaltılabileceğini belirleyebilmektedir. Rotating {{systems are}} exposed to centrifugal forces {{in the presence of}} an unbalance mass. This unbalanced state of machines often results in undesirable due to unbalanced centrifugal forces. Vibrations and unbalanced centrifugal forces usually lead to noise and energy loss, also causing bearings to wear down, and reducing the operating life and performance of the system. In order to ensure low energy consumption and high product quality, it is necessary to control the vibration levels and this in turn requires keeping the level of unbalance within an acceptable range. Unbalance in rotating systems, which appears to be the root cause of vibration, is of vital importance in turbomachinery, washing machines, machining tools, and electric motors. This thesis addresses the problem of vibration in rotating machinery and the use of liquid ring balancing systems to reduce vibrations by passive means, aiming to provide a model for liquid ring balancing systems, and to develop analysis methods in addition to tools for optimization of the liquid ring systems. General information has been gathered on balancing methods and an extensive literature survey has been conducted on passive balancing with emphasis on the use of liquid ring systems, which {{is the subject of this}} thesis. These are followed by theoretical information about conventional balancing methods and passive balancing systems using liquid rings. The operation of the liquid ring balancing systems is based on the fact that liquid in a partially-filled tube mounted on a rotating system, is self-aligned in a direction opposite to the unbalance under the effect of centrifugal forces. As such, the system behaves like a counter mass and in order for the system to function properly, it is required that the ratio of the volume of the liquid to that of the tube must be smaller than one. Furthermore, the liquid ring balancing systems are effective at frequencies higher than the natural frequency of the system. The liquid inside the balancing tube is positioned relative to the centre of rotation of the system. Thus, the centrifugal force caused by the liquid positioned on the opposite side of the unbalance compensates some of the centrifugal force caused by the unbalance itself. Otherwise, it would be impossible for the inner surface of the liquid to be vertically aligned and for the liquid to self-position itself. As its name implies, a liquid ring balancing system has a hollow ring partially filled with fluid which can be fresh water, salty water, oil, glycerine and liquid mercury etc. Although, liquid mercury may appear to be the best candidate due to its high density, liquid mercury is known to be extremely hazardous and should not be used if there is a risk of leakage. Another candidate, oil, is not preferred either in some applications as it may cause contamination. Salty water is usually the preferred option because of the relatively higher density. The liquid ring balancing system acts as a counter mass, positions the centre of mass of the liquid to the opposite side of the unbalance, thus reducing the net unbalance in the rotating system. The amount and distribution of the liquid is determined by rotating speed and the internal structure of the balancer. Passive balancing using liquid ring systems are efficient when the rotational speed of the machine is greater than the first natural frequency of the system. In other words, liquid ring balancers can be used in cases where there is a phase difference of 180 o between the forces caused by the unbalance and vibrations expressed in terms of displacement. Adhering to this constraint a model has been created for liquid ring balancers and an analysis method has been developed in accordance with this model. The basic approach adopted in this model is to determine the orientation of the liquid within the layer(s) and the balancing forces created by the liquid on the opposite side of the unbalance. It is then possible to estimate the balancing capacity of the system based on this principle and tools that will make it possible to optimize the system for a specific unbalance condition have been developed within the context of this thesis. The orientation(s) of the liquid within the layer(s) for a given vibration level (eccentricity) is/are determined using an iterative approach. However, in practice, it is the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>unbalance</b> in the system that is known, and not the vibration level, hence the passive balancing system should be analysed accordingly. This requires that another iteration to be used within the main iteration loop. The analysis method developed in this thesis is capable of estimating the orientation of the liquid and the amount of possible reduction in vibration levels when a passive balancing system is used. This allows estimating the balancing capacity of a given liquid balancing system. The tools developed in this thesis can also be used to optimize the balancing system for a specific unbalance condition. A computer code is developed in MATLAB to analyse the performance of singlelayer and multi-layer liquid/hydraulic balancers. The method and the tools developed in this thesis are then used to investigate the performance of a liquid balancing system installed on a sample machine, i. e. a washing machine. The effects of various parameters on the balancing capability of the liquid ring balancing systems are investigated. From optimisation point of view, the parameters considered in this investigation are the number of layers, the volumetric ratio, density of the liquid, geometric properties of the ring section and the mass of the liquid inside the balancer. The results obtained from the analyses presented in this thesis suggest that (i) the volumetric ratio of a balancing ring is one of the most important parameter in passive balancing. Neither a very low nor a very high value of volumetric ratio can yield efficient balancing. Volumetric ratio being about 50 % appears to be optimum (ii) A liquid ring balancer with a single layer cannot yield high balancing efficiency, (iii) Multi-layered balancing rings provide better balancing capacity when the same amount of balancing liquid is used, (iv) Using more number of layers in liquid balancing increases the balancing efficiency, (v) Using more liquid mass can yield better balancing, but doing so brings its own disadvantages. Results also confirm that it is not possible to remove unbalance completely by using liquid balancing rings. In other words, for the liquid balancing system to function, it is necessary that there must be some unbalance or eccentricity in the machine. This means that the unbalance can be reduced, but it cannot be eliminated by using liquid balancing rings. It should also be stated here that the analysis method developed within the scope of this thesis can be used for preliminary design of single-layer or multi-layer passive balancing rings for rotating mechanical systems. Although the liquid ring balancing systems are very effective in reducing the centrifugal force of the unbalance mass in steady state, it may increase the unbalance in transient state. Provisions such as orifices and obstructions can be made inside the tube for preventing unfavourable motions that may be caused by the liquid ring balancing systems. There are balancing systems comprising liquid balancing rings and spherical balls inside the liquid. It is recommended that the method developed within this thesis can be extended for such systems. Similarly, as a future work, a model can be developed for a system which consists of liquid balancing ring and a rotating mass inside the balancing liquid. In this thesis, it is assumed that during the steady state operation of a machine, the rotational speed of the system is high enough so that the acceleration experienced by the liquid is large compared to the gravitational acceleration. As a result, gravitation acceleration is ignored in the analyses here. However, it recommended that gravitational acceleration should be included in the analyses if the rotational speed is low or if the transient behaviour of the balancer is of interest during run-up. Finally, as another future work, it is recommended that to test a test rig should be developed for experimental investigation of liquid balancers as well as for validation of theoretical/numerical predictions.

40|$|Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) are {{the most}} modern {{measurement}} devices for electric power networks. Their performance, in terms of synchrophasor, frequency and rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) measurement accuracy are crucial for the overall performance of the network management and control applications {{that are expected to}} rely on PMU-based distributed measurement systems. In this regard, PMU performance should be assessed under different conditions.
