There is {{a number}} of {{mathematical}} models applied to simulate the migration of oil-derived pollution, with the LNAPL (Light non-aqueous phase liquid) volumes in the saturation and <b>aeration</b> <b>zones</b> being analysed in two-phase modeling. A number of hydrogeological parameters and the parameters describing the second phase consisting of oil derivatives are assumed {{for the sake of}} the simulation. A part of the data predetermined for the mathematical model is applied on the basis of direct investigations in the field or laboratory, whereas some data are based on a literature analysis or are used by analogy to similar areas. The model data should be additionally verified and validated in the mathematical model. In the case of the LNAPL remediation system being simulated, it is the parameters related to the ground-water environment and the parameters defining the free product of oil that are very important in determining the volume of the recovered LNAPL. With a good deal of data applied for the remediation process simulation one may expect model solutions of different levels of reliability. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

A common case of the infiltration of the oil derivative products to the ground water system is mainly connected with accidental oil spills in various types of environmental conditions. In this case we encounter numerous types of problems connected especially with the pollution in: 1) <b>aeration</b> <b>zones,</b> 2) saturation zones. The first step is a conceptual model for the proper recognition of the type and scale of the problem. After making a conceptual model it is possible to take a preliminary decision to recognize what sort of pollution is the source of the environmental problem. A study example describes modeling of free products of oil (LNAPL) floating on the groundwater table using MARS (Multiple Areal Remediation Simulator). The multiphase model was made on the basis of theoretical model concepts. In the modeling the recovery and migration of LNAPL are simulated, and the recoverable and residual spill volumes of derivate products of oil are estimated. Modeling indicates the best location of the remediation system and the pumping wells. Additionally, modelling can be applied to manage the remediation system for improving the efficiency and for decreasing the catchment area of piezometers and wells.

40|$|Control of Solids Retention Time (SRT) in the {{activated}} sludge process {{is critical for}} ensuring effective wastewater treatment. SRT sets {{the growth rate of}} microorganisms in the {{activated sludge}} process, thereby selecting the microbial composition of the mixed liquor and its settling and treatment properties. The industry has developed various methods to control activated sludge. This study evaluated seven (7) methods to calculate SRT and implemented a simple, straightforward hydraulic control of SRT method. The study was conducted at the 34 mgd Seneca WWTP in Eagan, MN, which operates a plug-flow nitrifying activated sludge process with reduced air-flows in initial zones to enhance phosphorus removal. Hydraulic control of SRT is based on a solids mass balance over the aeration tanks and clarifiers. Specifically, it depends on the influent wastewater forward flow rate into the aeration tanks, the clarifier underflow rate, the waste sludge flow rate and aeration tank volume in service. It eliminates the need for costly TSS sampling at various points in the process, along with its associated measurement variation and time lags. During this study, hydraulic control produced an SRT that agreed with conventional estimation methods, i. e. mass under aeration divided by mass flow rate wasted, when the conventional methods were corrected for solids inventory in the clarifiers. Hydraulic control of SRT provides a simple, real-time calculation to adjust wasting flow rates of return sludge to maintain a target SRT and a stable microbial population. At the Seneca WWTP, hydraulic control of SRT, combined with gently air-mixed inlet <b>aeration</b> <b>zones,</b> simplified process control, reduced O&M costs, and produced an excellent effluent quality that averaged 4. 6 mg/l TSS, 3. 6 mg/l BOD, 0. 58 mg / l total phosphorus and 0. 14 mg/l ammonia...|$|R

Soil hydraulic resistance {{was found to be}} negligible in the upper soil layers but concentrated where there was maximum root length density along the profile. Lower soil hydraulic resistance and higher rate permeability was exhibited by ICPL 87 (short duration) than in the medium duration pigeonpea, ICP 1 - 6.

Pers.) (cv. Tifway 419) and Zoysiagrass (ZG) (Zoysia spp.) grown in four contrasting soils. Four stresses—drought (D), waterlogging (WL), high compaction (HC) and low compaction (LC) —were applied either with or without a surface sand layer. Root zone properties, including root weight (RW), bulk density (BD), surface hardness (SH), redox potential (Eh) and non-capillary pore space (NCPS), were monitored over a four-month growth period. Surface hardness values were greater for the high compaction effort in treatments without sand, but were highest under drought. Sand addition resulted in lower SH for all grass × soil combinations. The soil texture influenced root zone BD for all turfgrasses, with the clay soils recording significantly lower bulk densities (< 1. 00 g/cm 3) than those with coarser fractions. Compaction had a minimal influence on BD, the effect being further modified by grass type. Low BD was associated with high RW. RW was also significantly higher in the sand-amended treatments. Waterlogging reduced Eh for all soils, with higher values recorded in the sand treatments. The redox potential was lowest in River Estate soil and in pots planted with ZG. Across turfgrasses, Princes Town and Talparo soils had significantly lower NCPS for the sand treatment. NCPS was highest for ZG across stress treatments, but values were similar to SG under compaction treatments.

Similar correlation of removal efficiencies with floc loading was evidenced under anaerobic and anoxic conditions (50 % LCFA removal for floc loadings lower than 100 mgCOD/gSS). Based on these findings it can be stated that under the conditions prevailing in anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic selector tanks, only a portion of LCFA is removed, and therefore the remaining LCFA under the completely mixed conditions prevailing at the <b>aeration</b> <b>zone</b> of a bioreactor would establish low enough floc loadings, thus stimulating M. parvicella growth. © 2010 Desalination Publications.

In the rubber dam’s impact area, the groundwater total hardness (TH) has declined since 2000, ultimately dropping to 100 – 300 mg/L in 2012. pH levels have shown no obvious changes. NH 4 -N concentration in the groundwater remained stable from 2000 to 2006, but it increased from 2007 to 2012, with the largest increase up to 0. 2 mg/L. NO 3 -N concentration in the groundwater generally declined in 2000 – 2006 and then increased from 2007; the largest increase was to 10 mg/L in 2012. Total dissolved solids (TDS) of the groundwater showed a general trend of decline from 2000 to 2009, but levels increased after 2010, especially along the south bank of the Luohe River where the largest increase recorded was approximately 100 mg/L. This study {{has shown that the}} increases in the concentrations of NH 4 -N and NO 3 -N were probably caused by changes in groundwater levels. Nitrates adsorbed by the silt clay of <b>aeration</b> <b>zone</b> appear to have entered the groundwater through physical and chemical reactions. TDS increased because of groundwater evaporation and some soluble ions entered the groundwater in the unsaturated zone. The distance of the contaminant {{to the surface of the}} aquifer became shorter due to the shallow depth of groundwater, resulting in the observed rise in pollutant concentrations more pronounced. 1...|$|E
40|$|The Snake River Aquifer System {{in eastern}} Idaho {{is one of}} the largest and most {{important}} regional water supplies within the United States. Safeguarding the Snake River Aquifer System from pollution underlying the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) is of critical importance to the U. S. Department of Energy. The present paper contains the results of the investigations. Its tasks were: analyze the impact of natural factors on groundwater vulnerability; develop the map of groundwater vulnerability to contamination; indicate contaminated sites for risk of groundwater contamination using the map. Main attention was paid to vadose zone (<b>aeration</b> <b>zone),</b> that determines potential danger of contaminant penetration from the land surface to groundwater table. Assessment of vadose zone protection role was based on the following controlling factors: passive factors – depth to water and conduct properties of unsaturated medium; active factors – recharge, including its main parts: precipitation and irrigation. Vulnerability assessment was done step by step by compiling a series of maps. Combining vadose zone map and the map of groundwater recharge at Eastern Snake River Plain, the resulting map reflecting all above mentioned factors were received. The Point Count System was a main concept of vulnerability assessment. Influence of each factor was specified by different numbers (Rank), which were determined by expert assessment. The lesser the Rank, the more favorable situation is with relation to groundwater vulnerability. Groundwater vulnerability is characterized by Rank’s sum that could vary from 8 to 40 in region under investigation. Total Rank sum characterizes groundwater vulnerability to contamination...|$|E
40|$|The {{countries}} of the world and of the European Union are developing hydrogeological models (HM) where, by means of computer modelling, the information necessary for the groundwater management is obtained. In 1996, Riga Technical University (RTU), upon assignment of the former State Geological Survey, established regional HM REMO for the central part of Latvia. REMO does not match demands of a modern water management for the whole country, the HM plane approximation step of 4000 meters is too crude. In 2010, RTU started the project of HM that includes the whole territory of Latvia and border areas of neighbouring countries. The project is co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund. HM accounts for 25 geological layers and its plane approximation step is 500 meters. HM have to be established, during 2010 - 2012, as the element of the Latvian Shared Environmental Information System. It is supported by the Latvian Environment, Geology and Meteorology Centre. HM will comprise geological and hydrogeological information provided by the centre. To ensure compatibility with models of other countries, the commercial program Groundwater Vistas is used for running HM. It contains software tools applied for groundwater modelling worldwide. For the establishment and calibration of HM, innovative methods are used: the map of the ground surface elevations (digital relief) serves as a boundary condition; the <b>aeration</b> <b>zone</b> is a formal aquitard; the actual geometry of HM may not be used in the initial phase of the model establishment. The model data will be used for regional evaluation of the groundwater flow distributions, especially, in areas bordering the neighbouring countries and the Baltic Sea. HM will provide data for establishment of local HM that are used for determination of the permissible productivity of well fields, for modelling contaminant migration and for evaluation of effectiveness of measures used for restoration of groundwater resources...|$|E
40|$|In 2012, {{scientists}} of Riga Technical University {{have developed the}} regional hydrogeological model (HM) of Latvia (LAMO). LAMO covers 475 km× 300 km area. It includes the territory of Latvia, the Gulf of Riga (active area of the HM) and border areas of the neighboring countries (presently, passive area of the HM). Both areas are separated by the border zone where outer boundary conditions for the active area must be fixed. LAMO simulates the steady state regime of the active groundwater zone that contains potable groundwater resources for Latvia. LAMO includes 25 geological layers and HM plane approximation step is 500 metres. The active LAMO volume is enveloped by its {{top and bottom surfaces}}, but the outer vertical surface of the border zone constitutes the shell of the HM. For the HM top and bottom surfaces and for the border zone, piezometric boundary conditions are arranged. Presence of the HM passive part makes the shell surface impermeable for the transboundary groundwater flow. This distortion of the natural groundwater regime must be compensated by a proper choice of boundary conditions that are fixed within the border zone. On the LAMO top surface, the digital relief (terrain) map is used as the boundary condition. The map includes elements of the hydrographical network (rivers, lakes, sea). The rivers are attached to various geological layers within the HM body. Special software has been developed to find the right attachment of over 200 rivers of Latvia to the HM. Lakes and the sea are joined with the HM through the <b>aeration</b> <b>zone.</b> The zone represents a formal aquitard that is considered in computing of infiltration flow for the HM. Because the digital relief is used as the boundary condition, the HM itself provides feasible infiltration flow distribution that can be adjusted by its calibration. Due to original methods of establishing the boundary conditions, LAMO has been created during {{a short period of time}} (2 years) ...|$|E
