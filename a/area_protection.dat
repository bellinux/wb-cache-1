Reference [13] divides the power system into several parts with the center of one important substation. It establishes all the IED correlation matrix and fault matrix, and detects the faulty area according to the features of the matrices. Reference [14] proposes several faulty detection methods on the basis of faulty voltage distribution, wide area impedance and the genetic information fusion techniques.|$|R
