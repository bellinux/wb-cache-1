500|$|The JAMs offered {{what they}} claimed were [...] "the last five" [...] copies of 1987 {{for sale at}} £1000 each in a full-page {{advertisement}} in the April 1988 edition of The Face. Drummond argued that the offer exploited a loophole in The JAMs' agreement with the MCPS: [...] "We were browsing around this record shop and came across these five copies of 1987.... We made it perfectly clear to the MCPS that we couldn't actually force the shops to send our LPs back.... ecause we bought them in a shop, these LPs don't come into the agreement <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> what we like with them and not break any laws." ...|$|E

"Devil Pray" [...] brings Madonna [...] "as {{a devoted}} disciple, {{drawn to a}} darker kind of prayer", as noted by The Quietus Amy Pettifer, and its story deals with sin, temptation and deliverance. The song starts with hand claps and guitar, [...] "whose country edge is [...] {{characteristic}} of Swedish producer Avicii's own output", claimed Pettifer. The chorus contains [...] "an intoned, warning list of narcotic distractions" [...] that [...] "offer brief relief", as she sings, [...] "And we can do drugs, and we can smoke weed, and we can drink whiskey  /  Yeah, we can get high, {{and we can get}} stoned  /  And we can sniff glue, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> E, and we can drop acid." ...|$|E
500|$|Disagreements {{about the}} {{ownership}} of the story ultimately led Moore to sever ties with DC Comics. Not wanting to work under a work for hire arrangement, Moore and Gibbons had a reversion clause in their contract for Watchmen. Speaking at the 1985 San Diego Comic-Con, Moore said: [...] "The way it works, if I understand it, is that DC owns it for the time they're publishing it, and then it reverts to Dave and me, so we {{can make all the}} money from the Slurpee cups." [...] For Watchmen, Moore and Gibbons received eight percent of the series' earnings. Moore explained in 1986 that his understanding was that when [...] "DC have not used the characters for a year, they're ours." [...] Both Moore and Gibbons said DC paid them [...] "a substantial amount of money" [...] to retain the rights. Moore added, [...] "So basically they're not ours, but if DC is working with the characters in our interests then they might as well be. On the other hand, if the characters have outlived their natural life span and DC doesn't want to do anything with them, then after a year we've got them <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> what we want with them, which I'm perfectly happy with." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{films were}} more potent with propagandistic {{symbolism}} than others. [...] Fifth Column Mouse is a cartoon that through childlike humor and political undertones depicted a possible outcome of World War II. [...] The film {{begins with a}} bunch of mice playing and singing a song about how they never worry. [...] One mouse notices a cat looking in through a window, but is calmed when another mouse tells him that the cat cannot get inside. [...] The cat however, bursts in through the front door alerting a mouse that wears a World War II style air raid warden helmet and screams, “Lights out,” promptly turning off the main light. [...] The phrase, 'lights out,' was a popular saying during the war, especially in major cities to encourage people to turn off their lights to hinder targeting by potential enemy bombers. [...] The same mouse who said the cat could not get inside, ends up getting caught by the cat. [...] The cat tells him that he will not kill him, but will give him cheese if the mouse follows the cat's instructions. [...] During the dialogue between the two, the cat's smile resembles the Tojo bucktooth grin and it speaks with a Japanese accent. [...] Near the end, the cat screams “Now get going!” and the mouse jumps to attention and gives the infamous Nazi salute. [...] The scene cuts to the biddable mouse, now an agent of influence, telling the other mice that the cat is here to “save us and not to enslave us,” “don’t be naughty mice, but appease him” so “hurry and sign a truce.” [...] This message of appeasement and signing a truce would have been all too familiar to the adults in the theaters who were probably with their children. [...] The next clip is of the cat lounging on pillows with multiple mice tending to its every need. [...] However, when the cat reveals that he wants to eat a mouse they all scatter. [...] Inside their hole, a new mouse is encouraging the others to be strong and fight the cat. [...] The mice are then shown marching in step with hardy, confident grins on their faces with “We Did it Before <b>and</b> <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Do</b> it Again” by Robert Merrill playing in the background. [...] Amidst the construction of a secret weapon, a poster of a mouse with a rifle is shown with the bold words “For Victory: Buy Bonds and Stamps.” [...] The mice have built a mechanical dog that chases the cat out of the house. [...] Before he leaves though a mouse skins the cat with an electric razor, but leaves three short dots and a long streak of fur on his back. [...] In Morse code, the letter [...] "V" [...] is produced through dot-dot-dot-dash. [...] As depicted in many pictures but made popular by Winston Churchill, the “V” for victory sign was a popular symbol of encouragement for the Allies. [...] The cartoon ends with the mice singing, “We did it before, we did it AGAIN!” ...|$|E
