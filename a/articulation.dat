5|$|As sensor coils {{are placed}} on the tongue of the subject, <b>articulation</b> may be {{affected}} depending on {{the placement of the}} coils, but no comparative analysis has shown whether <b>articulation</b> is altered because of the coils. The coils are about 3mm in size and are not considered to be a particularly large source of error for measurements. Some researchers have found that subjects are irritated by sensor coils placed on the tip of the tongue which can lead to disturbed <b>articulation.</b> Similarly, the wires attached to the sensor coils can inhibit <b>articulation</b> if not run out the side of the mouth.|$|E

40|$|Taxonomically {{organized}} data pervade science, {{business and}} everyday life. Unfortunately, taxonomies are often under-specified, limiting their utility in contexts such as data inte-gration, information navigation and autonomous agent com-munication. This work formalizes taxonomies and relation-ships between them as formulas in logic. This formalization concretizes notions such as consistency and inconsistency of taxonomies and <b>articulations</b> (inter-taxonomic relations) between them, enables the derivation of new <b>articulations</b> {{based on a}} given set of taxonomies and <b>articulations</b> and provides a framework for testing assumptions about under-specified taxonomies. Given the typical intractability of reasoning with tax-onomies and <b>articulations,</b> this research investigates many optimizations: from those that reduce the search space, to those that leverage parallel processing, to those investigat-ing logics more tractable than first-order logic (e. g., monadic first-order logic, propositional logic, description logics, and subsets of the RCC- 5 spatial algebra). Finally, in addition to reasoning with taxonomies and <b>articulations,</b> this research investigates how to repair inconsistent taxonomies and ar-ticulations, how to explain inconsistencies and discovered relations, and how to merge taxonomies given <b>articulations.</b> Critical to this research {{is the development of}} a framework for testing logics and support for the development of tax-onomies and <b>articulations.</b> This framework, CleanTax is already well under way and has been used to study articu-lations between two large-scale biological taxonomies. 1...|$|R

5|$|From the 11th century, {{architectural}} <b>articulation</b> included icons between pilasters, miniature towers {{supported by}} pilasters in {{the recesses of}} walls, and, on occasion, the use of wall pillars to support these towers. These miniature towers were of the southern dravida and northern bhumija and sekhari types and were mostly used to elaborate dravida types of <b>articulation.</b> The miniatures on single pilasters were decorated with a protective floral lintel on top, a form of decoration normally provided for depiction of gods. These elaborations are observed in the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri. These miniatures became common in the 12th century, {{and the influence of}} this northern <b>articulation</b> is seen in the Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi and in the nearby Nannesvara Temple.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the basic}} {{plan of the}} Western Chalukya style {{originated}} from the older dravida style, many of its features were unique and peculiar to it.

40|$|Relations between {{non-governmental}} organizations (NGOs) and {{companies have been}} the subject of a sharply increasing amount of publications in recent years within academic business journals. In this article, we critically assess this fast-developing body of literature, which we treat as forming a ‘business and society discourse’ on NGO-business relations. Drawing on discourse theory, we examine 199 academic articles in 11 business and society, international business, and management journals. Focusing on the dominant <b>articulations</b> on the NGO-business relationship and key signifiers they rely on, we analyze the problem-settings of articles in order to reveal the statements that are acceptable and appropriate within this field. Our threefold aim is to (1) identify dominant <b>articulations</b> of NGO-business relations in business and society discourse, (2) expose those <b>articulations</b> that are silenced or suppressed by these dominant <b>articulations,</b> and (3) critically assess possible power effects of these discursive dynamics in the field of discursivity. While business and society discourse on NGO-business relations overall remains open to many different <b>articulations,</b> we also find that those <b>articulations</b> that focus on NGO-business partnerships and governance initiatives tend to privilege collaborative and deliberative ways of engaging and marginalize more adversarial subject positions. We call for more recognition of the potentially constructive role that can be played by conflict...|$|R

5|$|In 2015, Cau et al. reconsidered {{the ecology}} of Balaur again in their reevaluation of its phylogenetic position, arguing that if Balaur was an avialan, it would be phylogenetically {{bracketed}} by taxa {{known to have been}} herbivorous, such as Sapeornis and Jeholornis. This suggests a non-hypercarnivorous lifestyle to be a more parsimonious conclusion and supports Cau's initial interpretations of its specializations. This is also indicated by the reduced third finger, the lack of a gynglymoid lower <b>articulation</b> of the second metatarsal and the rather small and moderately recurved second toe claw. Balaur had a broad pelvis, a broad foot, a large first toe, and broad lower ends of the metatarsals relative to the <b>articulation</b> surfaces; such a combination can in the remainder of the Theropoda only be found with the herbivorous Therizinosauridae.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 13th century, 12th century {{characteristics}} remained prominent; however, many parts that were formerly plain became decorated. This change is {{observed in the}} Muktesvara Temple at Chaudayyadanapura (Chavudayyadanapura) and the Santesvara Temple at Tilavalli, both in the Haveri district. The Muktesvara Temple with its elegant vimana was renovated {{in the middle of}} the 13th century. In the Tilavalli Temple, all the architectural components are elongated, giving it an intended crowded look. Both temples are built with a dravida <b>articulation.</b> Apart from exotic dravida articulations, some temples of this period have nagara <b>articulation,</b> built in the stepped-diamond and the square plan natural to a nagara superstructure. Notable among temples with a stepped-diamond style are the Ganesha Temple at Hangal, the Banashankari temple at Amargol (which has one dravida shrine and one nagara shrine), and a small shrine that is a part of the ensemble at the Mahadeva Temple. At Hangal, the architects were able to provide a sekhari superstructure to the shrine, while the lower half received a nagara <b>articulation</b> and depictions of miniature sekhari towers. The style of workmanship with a square plan is found at Muttagi and the Kamala Narayana Temple at Degoan.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Given a set {{of points}} {{corresponding}} to a 2 D projection of a non-planar shape, {{we would like to}} obtain a representation invariant to <b>articulations</b> (under no self-occlusions). It is a challenging problem since we need to account for the changes in 2 D shape due to 3 D <b>articulations,</b> viewpoint variations, as well as the varying effects of imaging process on different regions of the shape due to its non-planarity. By modeling an articulating shape as a combination of approximate convex parts connected by non-convex junctions, we propose to preserve distances between a pair of points by (i) estimating the parts of the shape through approximate convex decomposition, by introducing a robust measure of convexity and (ii) performing part-wise affine normalization by assuming a weak perspective camera model, and then relating the points using the inner distance which is insensitive to planar <b>articulations.</b> We demonstrate the effectiveness of our representation on a dataset with non-planar <b>articulations,</b> and on standard shape retrieval datasets like MPEG- 7. Key words: Shape representation, <b>articulations,</b> convex decomposition. ...|$|R
