40|$|These include: {{differences}} in the paths followed by the airplane and the balloon and therefore possibly even different air masses encountered; the limited experience of persomiel in the technique of calibrating and of mnking regularly scheduled observations of this kind; {{differences in}} time, in some cases, between the airplane and radiometeorograph observations; diiferences in rate of ascent and lag of radiometeorograph and aerometeorograph; possible changes in the <b>aerometeorograph</b> since last calibration; and possible differences between the initial temperatures of the instruments. It is planned {{in the near future}} to obtain comparisons by sending aloft the vnrious types of radiometeorographs simultaneously from the smie place, ulth recording, i. e., nonradio, meteorographs attached to the same balloon. This method of comparison is considered to be more relidble than the airplane observations used so far. In view of the promising results being obtained with radiometeorographs and because of the great value of the observationnl data, it is planned {{to increase the number of}} stations to six next fiscal year. To do this, it will be necessary to re,place airplane with radiometeorogrnph observations at some place,s, since additional funds were not made avnilable for this work. An important factor in this connection, which should reduce the cost materially at favorably located stations, is the large percentage of instruments which will be found and returned. The percentages of recovery for some of the past sounding balloon series made in tâ€™his country wit,h recording meteorographs, i. e., the nonradio types, are given in table 3...|$|E
