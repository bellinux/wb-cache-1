5|$|Hispanic {{women are}} now more highly {{represented}} among enlisted women in the Marine Corps than the other services. Hispanic women are reaching the top echelons of the Marine Corps both in the enlistment and officer ranks. On August 13, 2004, MGySgt. Abigail D. Olmos became the first female Master Gunnery Sergeant {{in the history of}} the Marine Corps. and on August 2, 2006, Brigadier General Angela Salinas, made history when she became the first Hispanic female to obtain a general rank in the Marines. To date servicewomen are still restricted from serving in the following positions: Infantry regiments, artillery battalions, all armored units, combat engineer battalions, reconnaissance units, riverine <b>assault</b> <b>craft</b> units, low altitude air defense units, and fleet anti-terrorism security teams. In Operation Iraqi Freedom female Marines have played a prominent role guarding checkpoints and searching Iraqi women and children. This in turn has exposed many of them to dangerous situations which in some cases could cost them their lives. Two Hispanic female Marines died in said conflict: Lance Corporal Juana Navarro, assigned to 9th Engineer Support Battalion, 3rd Marine Logistics Group, III Marine Expeditionary Force, and Corporal Ramona M. Valdez.|$|E
5|$|The 116th RCT of the 29th Infantry Division was to land two battalions in {{the western}} four beaches, to be {{followed}} 30 minutes later by the third battalion. Their landings were to be supported by the tanks of the 743rd Tank Battalion; two companies swimming ashore in amphibious DD tanks and the remaining company landing directly onto the beach from <b>assault</b> <b>craft.</b> To {{the left of the}} 116th RCT the 16th RCT of the 1st Infantry Division was also to land two battalions with the third following 30 minutes after, on Easy Red and Fox Green at the eastern end of Omaha. Their tank support was to be provided by the 741st Tank Battalion, again two companies swimming ashore and the third landed conventionally. Three companies of the 2nd Ranger Battalion were to take a fortified battery at Pointe du Hoc, five kilometers (3mi) to the west of Omaha. Meanwhile, C Company 2nd Rangers was to land on the right of the 116th RCT and take the positions at Pointe de la Percée. The remaining companies of 2nd Rangers and the 5th Ranger Battalion were to follow up at Pointe du Hoc if that action proved to be successful, otherwise they were to follow the 116th into Dog Green and proceed to Pointe du Hoc overland.|$|E
5|$|During the Song dynasty {{there was}} also great amount of {{attention}} given to the building of efficient automotive vessels known as paddle wheel craft. The latter had been known in China perhaps since the 5th century, and certainly by the Tang dynasty in 784 with the successful paddle wheel warship design of Li Gao. In 1134 the Deputy Transport Commissioner of Zhejiang, Wu Ge, had paddle wheel warships constructed {{with a total of}} nine wheels and others with thirteen wheels. However, there were paddle wheel ships in the Song that were so large that 12 wheels were featured {{on each side of the}} vessel. In 1135 the famous general Yue Fei (1103–1142) ambushed a force of rebels under Yang Yao, entangling their paddle wheel craft by filling a lake with floating weeds and rotting logs, thus allowing them to board their ships and gain a strategic victory. In 1161, gunpowder bombs and paddle wheel crafts were used effectively by the Song Chinese at the Battle of Tangdao and the Battle of Caishi along the Yangtze River against the Jurchen Jin dynasty during the Jin–Song Wars. The Jurchen invasion, led by Wanyan Liang (the Prince of Hailing), failed to conquer the Southern Song. In 1183 the Nanjing naval commander Chen Tang was given a reward for constructing ninety paddle wheel craft and other warships. In 1176, Emperor Xiaozong of Song (r. 1162–1189) issued an imperial order to the Nanjing official Guo Gang (who desired to convert damaged paddle wheel craft into junk ships and galleys) not to limit the number of paddle wheel craft in the navy's dockyards, since he had high esteem for the fast <b>assault</b> <b>craft</b> that won the Chinese victory at Caishi. However, paddle wheel craft found other uses besides effective assaults in warfare. The Arab or Persian Commissioner of Merchant Shipping for Quanzhou, the Muslim Pu Shougeng (who served from 1250 to 1275) noted that paddle wheel ships were also used by the Chinese as tugboats for towing.|$|E
50|$|The Mexican Navy {{includes}} 60 smaller patrol {{boats and}} 32 auxiliary ships. It acquired 40 fast military <b>assault</b> <b>crafts,</b> designated CB 90 HMN, between 1999 and 2001 and obtained a production license in 2002, enabling further units to be manufactured in Mexico.|$|R
25|$|In general, the PAIGC in Guinea was {{the best}} armed, trained and led of all the guerrilla movements. By 1970, it even had {{candidates}} training in the Soviet Union, learning to fly Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 jets and to operate Soviet-supplied amphibious <b>assault</b> <b>crafts</b> and APCs.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, Golding {{joined the}} Royal Navy in 1940. He fought (on board a destroyer) and was briefly {{involved}} in the pursuit and sinking of the German battleship Bismarck. He also participated in the invasion of Normandy on D-Day, commanding a landing ship that fired salvoes of rockets onto the beaches, and was in action at Walcheren in which 23 out of 24 <b>assault</b> <b>crafts</b> were sunk.|$|R
25|$|Cần Giuộc District was a Vietcong stronghold in the Mekong Delta. The {{operation}} {{plan called for}} the deployment of five Companies of the 3rd and 4th Battalions, 47th Infantry Regiment into the operations area by <b>assault</b> <b>craft</b> and sweep south towards the ARVN 2nd Battalion, 46th Infantry blocking positions {{near the town of}} Ap Bac. Company C, 3/47th Infantry would act as reserve.|$|E
25|$|Their {{mission was}} to provide {{supporting}} small-arms fire and to clear mines and obstacles {{in advance of the}} <b>assault</b> <b>craft.</b> The Canadian landing craft then followed to form up with craft from other Canadian Flotillas. H-hour was set for 7.25, and after a delay of twenty minutes for a more favourable tide in the Juno sector, Prince Davids landing craft started their hour-long trip to the beaches.|$|E
25|$|The raid {{was carried}} out {{on the night of}} 19/20 April 1941. As a result of a number of mishaps, things went awry from the beginning. The {{submarine}} missed its rendezvous with the landing ship, having been strafed by an Allied aircraft shortly before. Problems with the release gear for the <b>assault</b> <b>craft,</b> meant that some of the commando parties were late getting ashore and another landed at the wrong beach.|$|E
50|$|There was {{no single}} design of LCM used, unlike the landing craft, vehicle, {{personnel}} (LCVP) or landing <b>craft</b> <b>assault</b> (LCA) landing <b>craft</b> {{made by the}} US and UK respectively. There were several different designs built by the UK and US and by different manufacturers.|$|R
5000|$|In general, the PAIGC in Guinea was {{the best}} armed, trained, and led of all the guerrilla movements. After 1968 PAIGC forces were {{increasingly}} supplied with modern Soviet weapons and equipment, most notably SA-7 rocket launchers, radar-controlled AA cannon, and even jet aircraft {{in the form of}} several Ilyushin Il-14 bombers. [...] These weapons effectively undermined Portuguese air superiority, preventing the destruction by air of PAIGC encampments in territory it controlled. [...] By 1970 the PAIGC even had candidates training in the Soviet Union, learning to fly MIGs and to operate Soviet-supplied amphibious <b>assault</b> <b>crafts</b> and APCs.|$|R

25|$|On 12 December 1942, Empire Centaur {{was damaged}} {{in an attack}} by Italian <b>assault</b> <b>craft</b> at Algiers. The attack {{was carried out by}} the Decima Flottiglia MAS of the Regia Marina, using manned torpedoes {{despatched}} from the submarine Ambra. Empire Centaur returned to the United Kingdom in Convoy MKS 7, which departed from Algiers on 5 February 1943 and arrived at Liverpool on 17 March. She was bound for Cardiff.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 1/2 April 1982, Santísima Trinidad halted 500 metres off Mullet Creek and lowered 21 Gemini <b>assault</b> <b>craft</b> into the water. They {{contained}} 84 special forces troopers of Lieutenant-Commander Guillermo Sánchez-Sabarots's 1st Amphibious Commandos Group and a small party under Lieutenant-Commander Pedro Giachino, who was normally second-in-command of the 1st Marine Infantry Battalion, that was to capture Government House. The Argentine Rear Admiral Jorge Allara, through a message radioed from Santisima Trinidad, had requested to Rex Hunt a peaceful surrender, but the proposal was rejected.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of the day, all but one of her craft had been crippled, sunk or beached high and dry. As the one {{remaining}} <b>assault</b> <b>craft</b> made its way back to Prince David, a charging tank carrier forced her over an obstacle, which tore out her bottom and she sank at once. An outbound lighter ferried her crew back to Prince David. With wounded on board and unable to retrieve any of her landing craft, Prince David sailed to Southampton, ending her D-Day involvement. Both ships made four more reinforcement trips to Normandy, one on 18 June and three in July.|$|E

25|$|The MTs had {{a length}} of 5.62m and a beam of 1.62m. They were {{propelled}} by a 95horsepower Alfa Romeo AR 6cc outboard motor and developed a maximum speed of 33knots at full load. The boats were specially equipped to be launched from a surface mother ship and then make their way through obstacles such as torpedo nets. The pilot would steer the <b>assault</b> <b>craft</b> {{on a collision course}} at his target ship, and then would jump from his boat before impact and warhead detonation. The pilot's cockpit was at the rear, in order to ensure an even distribution of weight with the 330kg explosive charge inside the bow.|$|E
25|$|Task Force 117 {{meanwhile}} {{had established}} patrols on the Can Tho River {{along the southern}} boundary of the operations area to prevent the communists from escaping. About 2030 an armored troop carrier (ATC) {{was hit in the}} port bow causing an explosion. An assault support patrol boat went to the aid of the ATC and hit by communist automatic weapons fire. They returned fire was shut down the communists. Ten minutes later a second ATC was fired upon and missed by a recoilless rifle. The ATC immediately returned and suppressed the fire. There were no American casualties in either attack. The American units continued their patrols without incident until 0215 when a major action occurred as a large communist force attempted to escape. An assault support patrol boat came under heavy fire from both banks and sustained several 1340 rocket hits, causing heavy flooding and wounding two crewmen. Other river <b>assault</b> <b>craft</b> moved into the area and suppressed the communist fire, but one assault support patrol boat sank as it was being towed by a monitor. All crew members were rescued, but the monitor received several hits while moving to assist the disabled assault support patrol boat. During the same period, another assault support patrol boat, operating four kilometers east of the first attack, was hit by heavy communist rocket and automatic weapons fire. The boat captain and radio men were killed and the three other crewmen were wounded but were able to beach the boat. The communist attack lasted 90 minutes, with four US <b>assault</b> <b>craft</b> involved in the battle. A light helicopter fire team was called in to help to cut down the enemy fire.|$|E
25|$|The {{landings}} {{went ahead}} unopposed and the commandos {{moved to the}} various objectives, that had been identified by intelligence. Little damage was done {{as a number of}} the targets proved not to exist or were not where they were thought to be. One party was able to damage a bridge, while another set a tyre dump on fire and blew up the breeches of a number of naval guns. Due to the delays during the landings and the need to depart while it was still dark, time ran out and the commandos were forced to withdraw. On the way back, an officer was shot when he failed to respond correctly when challenged by a sentry, while 67 men, not knowing that there were no <b>assault</b> <b>craft</b> at their beach due to the earlier error, were left behind and later captured.|$|E

25|$|The <b>assault</b> <b>craft</b> {{departed}} from Olterra {{during the early}} hours of 8 December. At 2:15 AM, the first human torpedo reached the area of the boom defences. The motor launches and sentries inside the British base were quietly active and alert, conscious of the danger of a potential attack on the fleet at anchor. One of the security measures taken by the Royal Navy after the summer incursions of combat swimmers was the deployment at Gibraltar of an underwater bomb disposal unit, under the command of Lieutenant Lionel Crabb. A pattern of depth charges was dropped by the motor barges at an interval of three minutes. The craft of Visintini and Magro was apparently hit by one of the charges and destroyed when they were trying to find a breach in the steel net protecting the harbour. Their bodies were recovered by the British some days later and buried at sea with full honors. The second “pig” also endured the strong response of British defences after being uncovered by a searchlight. After a long chase by anti-submarine boats, the Italian crew decided to scuttle their craft and took shelter on board an American freighter. They discarded their swimsuits before submitting themselves to Gibraltar authorities. The last manned torpedo was {{caught in the middle of}} the general alarm across the stronghold, but managed to slip beneath the waters and fool the submarine chasers. The copilot, Leone, became missing during the pursuit and was never found; Cella, meanwhile, abandoned the craft elsewhere, thinking that he was still near Gibraltar or, in the best case, stranded close to the Spanish coast. With the idea of becoming a prisoner of war or being arrested and interned by Spanish authorities in mind, Cella surfaced, only to find that he was just a few meters away from Olterra. His torpedo was recovered by the Italians the following day. The two divers captured by the British told their interrogators that the attack was launched by submarine, successfully deceiving Allied intelligence. Nevertheless, the first human torpedoes mission ended in failure.|$|E
500|$|The {{focus of}} the main naval {{bombardment}} was then switched to the beach defenses, and at 06:00 36 M7 Priest howitzers and 34 tanks that were approaching the beach on LCTs began to supplement the naval guns. They were joined by fire from ten landing craft-mounted 4.7-inch guns and the rockets of nine Landing Craft Tank (Rocket), the latter planned to hit as the <b>assault</b> <b>craft</b> were just [...] from the beach.|$|E
500|$|The Normandy {{landings}} {{were the}} largest seaborne invasion in history, with nearly 5,000 landing and <b>assault</b> <b>craft,</b> 289 escort vessels, and 277 minesweepers. They hastened {{the end of}} the war in Europe, drawing large forces away from the Eastern Front that might otherwise have slowed the Soviet advance. The opening of another front in western Europe was a tremendous psychological blow for Germany's military, who feared a repetition of the two-front war of World War I. The Normandy landings also heralded the start of the [...] "race for Europe" [...] between the Soviet forces and the Western powers, which some historians consider to be the start of the Cold War.|$|E

25|$|For centuries the Royal Navy {{had been}} landing {{soldiers}} on hostile shores, prominent examples being Quebec 1759, Peking 1900, Zeebrugge Raid of 1918, {{and during the}} Dardanelles campaign 1915-16. During the inter-war period, however, a combination of recent experience and economic stringency contributed to the delay in producing a modern infantry <b>assault</b> landing <b>craft.</b>|$|R
500|$|The initial assault did {{not proceed}} entirely to plan. [...] The {{crossing}} {{was set to}} begin at 10:40pm but was delayed by the late arrival of several <b>assault</b> <b>craft.</b> Additionally several explosive charges on the eastern {{bank of the river}} designed to clear a path through landmines and the 'bund' failed to detonate. [...] The 2nd Battalion The Gloucestershire Regiment then discovered several Buffaloes were inoperative and so the companies were forced to cross separately and not in one assault as planned. Despite this the four companies of 2nd Battalion began crossing separately, their way illuminated by Monty's moonlight (searchlights reflecting their light off the clouds overhead) and Bofors guns firing coloured tracer in the direction of attack. [...] Under the cover of heavy machine guns and mortars the first company reached {{the west bank of the}} IJssel at 11.15pm. [...] They began to take their objectives in the face of light opposition along the riverbank, sustaining 32 casualties. [...] After a slight delay they secured the landing area for the prefabricated Bailey bridge and at 12.50am The Royal Canadian Engineers began floating the components of the bridge into position. [...] The second wave; the 2nd Battalion The South Wales Borderers crossed the river under heavy artillery fire. [...] Their <b>assault</b> <b>craft</b> drifted downstream in the crossing, but once ashore they advanced rapidly into the city. However their advance stalled and the 1/7th Battalion, Duke of Wellington's Regiment, originally due to cross in Phase 3, was sent over the river to support them. [...] By 7:00am the 2nd Battalion The Essex Regiment were across the river and by 8:45am the RCE had set up a pontoon ferry to begin moving tanks of the Ontario Regiment across as well.|$|E
500|$|The Normandy {{landings}} {{were the}} largest seaborne invasion in history, with nearly 5,000 landing and <b>assault</b> <b>craft,</b> 289 escort vessels, and 277 minesweepers participating. Nearly 160,000 troops crossed the English Channel on D-Day, with 875,000 men disembarking {{by the end}} of June. Allied casualties on the first day were at least 10,000, with 4,414 confirmed dead. The Germans lost 1,000 men. The Allied invasion plans had called for the capture of Carentan, St. Lô, Caen, and Bayeux on the first day, with all the beaches (other than Utah) linked with a front line [...] from the beaches; none of these objectives were achieved. The five bridgeheads were not connected until 12 June, by which time the Allies held a front around [...] long and [...] deep. Caen, a major objective, was still in German hands at the end of D-Day and would not be completely captured until 21 July. [...] The Germans had ordered French civilians, other than those deemed essential to the war effort, to leave potential combat zones in Normandy. Civilian casualties on D-Day and D+1 are estimated at 3,000 people.|$|E
500|$|To {{the left}} of Dog Green sat Dog White, between the Vierville and Les Moulins strongpoints (defending draws D-1 and D-3); and here was a {{different}} story. As a result of earlier mis-landings, and now because of their own mis-landing, the troops of C/116 found themselves alone at Dog White, {{with a handful of}} tanks from the first wave in sight. The smoke from the grass fires covering their advance up the beach, they gained the seawall with few casualties, and were in better shape than any unit on the 116th RCT front so far. Although the 1st Battalion was effectively disarmed of its heavy weapons when D/116 suffered a disastrous landing, the buildup at Dog White continued. C/116 was joined by the 5th Ranger Battalion almost in its entirety. The Ranger commander, recognizing the situation at Dog Green on the run-in, ordered the <b>assault</b> <b>craft</b> to divert into Dog White. Like the C/116, the smoke covered their advance, although the 2nd Rangers were caught out on the right flank of the Ranger's landing. This was where the 116th RCT regimental command group, including the 29th Division assistant commander Brigadier General Norman [...] "Dutch" [...] Cota, was able to land relatively unscathed.|$|E
50|$|The Commandos {{trained in}} the New Forest and Lepe, near Southampton, based aboard the landing ship, HMS Prince Albert on which they were transported to Dover on 18 April.
