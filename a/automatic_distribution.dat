50|$|Once silage {{has entered}} the {{conveyor}} system, it can be handled by either manual or <b>automatic</b> <b>distribution</b> systems. The simplest manual distribution system uses a sliding metal platform under the pickup channel. When slid open, the forage drops through the open hole and down a chute into a wagon, wheelbarrow, or open pile. When closed, the forage continues past the opening and onward {{to other parts of}} the conveyor. Computer automation and a conveyor running the length of a feeding stall can permit the silage to be automatically dropped from above by each animal, with the amount dispensed customized for each location.|$|E

5000|$|Centrex obviates {{the need}} for {{separate}} exchange lines delivered to a site for use with a 1A2 Key System or similar, or PBX. Instead, telephone extensions, called Centrex lines, are delivered directly from the local exchange to the user. Some customers, however, still like to use a key telephone system for a small office within the large corporate Centrex, in an arrangement called [...] "key behind Centrex". Unlike with a conventional PBX, {{it is a simple}} matter to have extensions at different locations while allowing them to function as if they were within the same building. Newer IP PBX systems also allow phones at any location with a WAN or Internet connection to act as a local extension. Facilities such as Direct Inward Dialing (DID), where individual extensions are offered a direct and unique telephone number for incoming calls, are standard features in a Centrex environment. Stations may also be part of a hunt group, allowing for <b>automatic</b> <b>distribution</b> of incoming calls to two or more extensions.|$|E
40|$|With the {{continuous}} revolution of multicore architecture, several parallel programming platforms {{have been introduced}} in order {{to pave the way}} for fast and efficient development of parallel algorithms. Back into its categories, parallel computing can be done through two forms: Data-Level Parallelism (DLP) or Task-Level Parallelism (TLP). The former can be done by the distribution of data among the available processing elements while the latter is based on executing independent tasks concurrently. Most of the parallel programming platforms have built-in techniques to distribute the data among processors, these techniques are technically known as <b>automatic</b> <b>distribution</b> (scheduling). However, due to their wide range of purposes, variation of data types, amount of distributed data, possibility of extra computational overhead and other hardware-dependent factors, manual distribution could achieve better outcomes in terms of performance when compared to the <b>automatic</b> <b>distribution.</b> In this paper, this assumption is investigated by conducting a comparison between automatic and our newly proposed manual distribution of data among threads in parallel. Empirical results of matrix addition and matrix multiplication show a considerable performance gain when manual distribution is applied against <b>automatic</b> <b>distribution...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an <b>automatic</b> data <b>distribution</b> method which deal {{with both the}} alignment and the distribution problems in a single optimization phase, as opposed to sequentially solving these two inter-dependent approaches as done by previous work. The core of this work is called the Communication-Parallelism Graph, which describes the relationships among array dimensions of the same and different array references regarding communication and parallelism. The overall data distribution problem is then formulated as a linear 0 - 1 integer programming problem, where the objective function to be minimized is the total execution time. The solution is static {{in the sense that}} the layout of the arrays does not change during the execution of the program. We also show the feasibility of using this approach to solve the problem in terms of compilation time and quality of the solutions generated.

40|$|While {{traditional}} {{parallel computing}} systems {{are still struggling}} to gain a wider acceptance, the largest parallel computer that has ever been available is currently growing with the communication resource Internet. Unfortunately it is also rarely used in the parallel computation eld. The reason for the rejection of parallel computers is mainly the diculty of parallel programming. In this paper we propose the Self Distributing Associative ARChitecture (SDAARC). It has been derived from the Cache Only Memory Architecture (COMA). COMAs provide a distributed shared memory (DSM) with <b>automatic</b> <b>distribution</b> of data. We show how this paradigm of data distribution can be extended to the <b>automatic</b> <b>distribution</b> of instruction sequences (microthreads).

Discrete controller synthesis is a formal method used to ensure properties on a flexible system which does not a priori verify them. However, this method is efficient only on Boolean programs. More complex embedded systems, comprising complex data types and structures, cannot be addressed without abstraction means. We show how such abstractions can be obtained automatically using a type-directed projection operation. This operation allows then the safe recombination of the result of the synthesis with the original abstracted system, preserving the ensured properties...|$|E
