In 1978 there were 105 such firms, employing nearly 20,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Each of the {{proposed}} mechanisms for Sedna's extreme orbit would leave a distinct mark on the structure and dynamics of any wider population. If a trans-Neptunian planet was responsible, all such objects would share roughly the same perihelion (about 80AU). If Sedna were captured from another planetary system that rotated {{in the same direction}} as the Solar System, then all of its population would have orbits on relatively low inclinations and have semi-major axes ranging from 100–500AU. If it rotated in the opposite direction, then two populations would form, one with low <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> high inclinations. The perturbations from passing stars would produce a wide variety of perihelia and inclinations, each dependent on the number and angle of such encounters.|$|E
5|$|El Salvador {{returned}} {{to participate in}} the 1961 CCCF Championship, hosted in Costa Rica, alongside nine other national teams.

5|$|Insoluble ionic {{compounds}} can be {{precipitated by}} mixing two solutions, {{one with the}} cation <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> the anion in it. Because all solutions are electrically neutral, the two solutions mixed must also contain counterions of the opposite charges. To ensure that these do not contaminate the precipitated ionic compound, {{it is important to}} ensure they do not also precipitate. If the two solutions have hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions as the counterions, they will react with one another in what is called an acid–base reaction or a neutralization reaction to form water. Alternately the counterions can be chosen to ensure that even when combined into a single solution they will remain soluble as spectator ions.|$|E
