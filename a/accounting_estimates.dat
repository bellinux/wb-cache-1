50|$|International Accounting Standard 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in <b>Accounting</b> <b>Estimates</b> and Errors or IAS 8 is an {{international}} financial reporting standard (IFRS) adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).

Changes in accounting policies and corrections of errors are generally accounted for retrospectively, unless this is impracticable; whereas changes in <b>accounting</b> <b>estimates</b> are generally accounted for prospectively.|$|E

50|$|Fraudulent {{financial}} reporting, {{also known}} as earnings management fraud. In this context, management intentionally manipulates accounting policies or <b>accounting</b> <b>estimates</b> to improve financial statements. Public and private corporations commit fraudulent financial reporting to secure investor interest or obtain bank approvals for financing, as justifications for bonuses or increased salaries or to meet expectations of shareholders. The Securities and Exchange Commission has brought enforcement actions against corporations for many types of fraudulent financial reporting, including improper revenue recognition, period-end stuffing, fraudulent post-closing entries, improper asset valuations, and misleading non-GAAP financial measures.|$|E

50|$|Audit {{committees}} typically review {{financial statements}} quarterly and annually in public companies. In addition, members will often discuss complex <b>accounting</b> <b>estimates</b> and judgments made by {{management and the}} implementation of new accounting principles or regulations. Audit committees interact regularly with senior financial management such as the CFO and Controller and {{are in a position}} to comment on the capabilities of these managers. Should significant problems with accounting practices or personnel be identified or alleged, a special investigation may be directed by the audit committee, using outside consulting resources as deemed necessary.|$|E
50|$|Changes in <b>accounting</b> <b>estimates</b> are {{reflected}} prospectively (that is, {{from the date}} of change) by including it in the income statement {{for the period of}} the change (if the change affects that period only), or the period of the change and future periods (if the change affects both). However, to the extent that a change in an accounting estimate gives rise to changes in assets and liabilities, or relates to an item of equity, it is recognised by adjusting the carrying amount of the related asset, liability, or equity item in the period of the change.|$|E
50|$|Opportunities: Although the {{financial}} statements of all companies are potentially subject to manipulation, the risk is greater for companies in industries where significant judgments and <b>accounting</b> <b>estimates</b> are involved. Turnover in accounting personnel or other deficiencies in accounting and information processes can create an opportunity for misstatement. As for misappropriation of assets, opportunities are greater in companies with accessible cash or with inventory or other valuable assets, especially if the assets are small or easily removed. A lack of controls over payments to vendors or payroll systems, can allow employees to create fictitious vendors or employees and bill the company for services or time.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{dissertation}} is to investigate the effect of analytical review results on auditors' effort of auditing <b>accounting</b> <b>estimates.</b> Other objectives involve examining the moderating effect of personality traits (optimism), patterns-for-coping (vigilance), and level of experience on auditors' effort of auditing <b>accounting</b> <b>estimates.</b> In examining the effects of optimism and vigilance on auditing <b>accounting</b> <b>estimates,</b> the study makes a significant original contribution to the extant literature in audit judgement. The subjects were public accountants at different levels from both Big Six as well as non-Big Six firms. The findings of the study indicate that auditors' perceptions to extend tests of details related to the balances of the <b>accounting</b> <b>estimates,</b> according to the audit hours allocated to the budgeted time plan, did vary significantly across treatment groups. The analytical review results and the two dimensions of the individual psychological differences influenced their confidence in their assignment of the audit effort. Analytical review results were found to affect the audit plan for <b>accounting</b> <b>estimates</b> when these results signaled fluctuations. However, the conservatism tendency found by previous studies {{was found to be}} valid in this study. Optimism dimension was significant in moderating auditors' judgement yet vigilance and experience level were inconclusive in their influence...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAccounting {{estimates}} {{occur because}} {{a large number}} of items in financial statements cannot be measured precisely but can only be estimated. Significant <b>accounting</b> <b>estimates</b> are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. The aim of the paper was to identify whether Croatian quoted companies disclose all information about <b>accounting</b> <b>estimates</b> related to the Investment property, as required by IAS 40. The research included 132 quoted companies in Croatia that apply IFRSs. The research results showed that investment property has a relatively small share in the structure of total assets of quoted companies in Croatia, which {{is probably one of the}} reasons why related <b>accounting</b> <b>estimates</b> published in the notes are brief and incomplete. The general conclusion is that the notes regarding <b>accounting</b> <b>estimates</b> on investment property are composed of definitions set in the standard, instead of providing more transparent information for investors and other interested users of financial statements. As expected, the companies with the higher share of investment property have shown greater level of transparency, providing additional information which is not required by the standards...|$|E
