She had not died intestate, like her brother. The first clause of her will contained the testator's grateful recognition of Adela Restall's Christian act of forgiveness. The second clause (after stating that there were neither relatives nor children to be benefited by the will) left Adela Restall mistress of Mrs. Cosway Benshaw's fortune--on the one merciless condition that she did not marry Edwin Cosway.

2500|$|Schopenhauer's moral theory {{proposed}} that only compassion can drive moral acts. According to Schopenhauer, compassion alone {{is the good}} of the object <b>of</b> the <b>acts,</b> that is, they cannot be inspired by either the prospect of personal utility or the feeling of duty. Mankind can also be guided by egoism and [...] Egotistic acts are those guided by self-interest, desire for pleasure or happiness. Schopenhauer believed most of our deeds belong to this class. <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>malice</b> are different from egotistic acts. As in the case <b>of</b> <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> compassion, these do not target personal utility. Their aim is to cause damage to others, independently of personal gains. He believed, like Swami Vivekananda in the unity of all with one-self and also believed that ego is the origin of pain and conflicts, that reduction of ego frames the moral principles.|$|R

The Bosnian Serb suspension of talks and shelling of the town 'seemed a deliberate <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>malice</b> and political intent'.

5000|$|Acts {{linked with}} the hero {{syndrome}} {{should not be confused}} with <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>malice,</b> for example, a punished firefighter exacting revenge or an insatiable level of excitement, as was found in a federal study of more than 75 firefighter arsonists. [...] However, <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> the hero syndrome have been linked to previously failed heroism. The hero syndrome may also be a more general yearning for self-worth. People with hero syndrome will usually cause an accident and pretend to help. In corporate environments, the Hero syndrome manifests itself when the protagonist suffering the syndrome creates supposed, implied or ostensible crises only to eventually resolve them thereby becoming the saviour of the day, the hero of the moment.The ulterior motive for these actions can sometimes be to show that the sufferer is a valuable asset to the company, when there is an abundance of factual evidence to the contrary.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{simulation}} model for a multifaceted online e-Voting system. The proposed model is capable of handling electronic ballots with multiple scopes at the same time, e. g., presidential, municipal, and parliamentary, amongst others. The model caters for integrity of an election process {{in terms of the}} functional and non-functional requirements. The functional requirements embedded {{in the design of the}} proposed system warrant well-secured identification and authentication processes for the voter through the use of combined simple biometrics. Of utmost importance are the requirements for correctness, robustness, coherence, consistency, and security. To verify the robustness and reliability of the proposed system, intensive computer simulations were run under varying voting environments, viz. voter density, voter inter-arrival times, introduced <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>malice,</b> etc. Results <b>of</b> the simulations show the impact of several parameters on the performance of the system. These results provide the proper grounds that would guide the decision maker in customizing an e-voting system. Key-Words: e-voting, modeling and simulation, performance evaluation 1...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{emergency}} backup and storage facilities to supplement existing facilities {{in response to}} the potential effects of various natural and anthropogenic hazards (e. g., floods, fires, outages, and <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>malice)</b> can be an effective way of reducing vulnerability and enhancing the resilience of supply chain and other logistics functions. Although there can be additional costs associated with utilizing emergency backup and storage facilities, they can be a particularly attractive and cost-effective alternative in those cases where long-term disruptions can, or should, be expected. In this paper we use set cover location modeling as a decision to determine the number of backup facilities to locate under varying cover, anticover, and complementary anticover distances. We then add the flexibility of allowing existing facilities to serve as backup facilities and explore the interrelationships among hazards, vulnerability, and location. Finally, these model formulations are applied to an example data set over 900 cities and towns in New England and New York. Copyright (c) 2008 Copyright the Authors.

A frightened Gongsun Yuan sent his high ministers Wang Jian (王建) and Liu Fu (柳甫) to negotiate the terms of surrender, where he promised to present himself bound to Sima Yi once the siege was lifted. Sima Yi, wary of Gongsun Yuan's double-crossing past, executed the two, explaining his actions in a message to Gongsun Yuan that he desired nothing less than an unconditional surrender and [...] "these two men were dotards who must have failed to convey your intentions; I have already put them to death on your behalf. If you still have anything to say, then send a younger man of intelligence and precision." [...] When Gongsun Yuan sent Wei Yan (衛演) for another round of talks, this time requesting he be allowed to send a hostage to the Wei court, Sima Yi dismissed the final messenger as a waste of time: [...] "Now that you are not willing to come bound, you are determined to have death; there is no need of sending any hostage." [...] Apparently, Sima Yi's previous suggestion of further negotiations was nothing more than an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>malice</b> that gave false hope to Gongsun Yuan while prolonging the siege and placing further strain on the supplies within the city.|$|E

60|$|The party I {{speak of}} (like some amongst us who would disparage {{the best friends}} of their country) {{resolved}} to make the king either violate his principles of toleration or incur the odium of protecting Papists. They therefore brought in this bill, and made it purposely wicked and absurd {{that it might be}} rejected. The then court party, discovering their game, turned the tables on them, and returned their bill to them stuffed with still greater absurdities, that its loss might lie upon its original authors. They, finding their own ball thrown back to them, kicked it back again to their adversaries. And thus this act, loaded with the double injustice of two parties, neither of whom intended to pass what they hoped the other would be persuaded to reject, went through the legislature, contrary to the real wish of all parts of it, and of all the parties that composed it. In this manner these insolent and profligate factions, as if they were playing with balls and counters, made a sport of the fortunes and the liberties of their fellow-creatures. Other <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> persecution have been <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>malice.</b> This was a subversion of justice from wantonness and petulance. Look into the history of Bishop Burnet.

5000|$|In Morse v. Frederick (1987) Justice Clarence Thomas, concurring {{with the}} majority, argued that Tinker's ruling contradicted [...] "the {{traditional}} {{understanding of the}} judiciary's role in relation to public schooling," [...] and ignored the history of public education (127 S.Ct. 2634). He believed the judiciary's role to determine whether students have freedom of expression was limited by in loco parentis. He cited Lander v. Seaver (1859), which held that in loco parentis allowed schools to punish student expression that the school or teacher believed contradicted the school's interests and educational goals. This ruling declared that the only restriction the doctrine imposed were <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>malice</b> or <b>acts</b> that caused permanent injury.

There was no information given as to whether ASIO or Zygier initiated the contact. Israel and Australia have both denied the allegation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office stated that [...] "Mr Zygier had no contact with the Australian security services and organisations", whilst a spokeswoman for the Australian Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus has described the Israeli statement as consistent with the full briefing ASIO gave the Attorney-General. Sources close to Mossad expressed doubts that talking to Australian security services would 'earn' Zygier such a harsh treatment. However, Israeli journalist Alon Ben-David, who is familiar with the case but is still bound by the gag order, suggested that [...] "it's fair to assume that Zygier was charged with divulging state secrets to a foreign element", but who did not <b>act</b> out <b>of</b> <b>malice,</b> but out <b>of</b> distress.
