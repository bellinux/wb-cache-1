50|$|She created Untitled (Corpus Delicti) in 1993 with a {{combination}} of <b>air-sickness</b> <b>bags,</b> cardboard, and polyurethane cord. The bags come from airlines of different nations. One of her well known areas of work is her sculptures with cruzeiros, the devalued Brazilian currency. She created a collage of 100 and 100,000 bills painted over and put together into a square titled All the One-Hundreds.|$|E
5000|$|In 2013, Airlines for America {{assembled}} {{a coalition of}} labor, business, and consumer advocacy groups in order to oppose increasing the tax on airline tickets that funds the Transportation Security Administration. A4A called this campaign [...] "Stop Air Tax Now." [...] A4A's efforts were {{in response to a}} proposal in late 2013 to increase the tax to $5.00 from $2.50 per ticket. In 2012 this tax generated about $2.3 billion in revenue, double the amount for 2002. A4A staffers handed out <b>air-sickness</b> <b>bags</b> and leaflets at Washington Reagan National Airport asking [...] "Are higher taxes on air travel making you sick?" [...] Nicholas Calio said, [...] "Raising taxes is lose-lose for airlines, passengers, jobs and our overall economy - it’s inappropriate for Congress to use airline passengers as an ATM when it needs more money. Doubling the TSA passenger security tax would cost passengers more than $730 million annually, placing a huge additional tax on the traveling public, with no direct benefit to those who pay it.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Magnotta {{booked a}} ticket for a flight from Montreal to Paris on May 25, using a {{passport}} with his own name. After his arrival in France, his cell phone signal was traced to a hotel in Bagnolet, but he had left by the time police arrived. Pornographic magazines and an <b>air-sickness</b> <b>bag</b> {{were found in the}} hotel room. Magnotta used a false passport with the name [...] "Kirk Trammel" [...] at the hotel. He had contacts in Paris from a previous visit in 2010, and police were following a large-framed man who had been in contact with Magnotta. Another man he stayed with for two nights did not realize who he was until he had left. Magnotta then boarded a Eurolines bus at the Bagnolet coach station bound for Berlin, Germany.|$|R
2500|$|An {{even more}} extreme example was his notorious [...] "sick bag" [...] prank. This {{involved}} carrying {{on to an}} aircraft a tin of Heinz Russian Salad, which he would then surreptitiously empty into an <b>air-sickness</b> <b>bag.</b> At the appropriate point in the flight, he would pretend to vomit loudly and violently into the bag. Then, to the horror of passengers and crew, he would proceed to eat the contents. One April Fools' Day Humphries placed a roast dinner and glass of champagne in an inner-city rubbish bin. Later in the morning, when there were many businesspeople queuing at a nearby building, Humphries approached {{the group as a}} dirty, dishevelled man. He walked to the bin, opened the lid and proceeded to lift the roast and glass of champagne and drink from the glass. Much to the amazement of watchers-by, he found a suitable seating area and began to eat the meal. Such stunts were the early manifestations of a lifelong interest in the bizarre, discomforting, and subversive.|$|R
