50|$|According to the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA), the IIHS {{report was}} an attempt to either ban entire {{categories}} of motorcycles, or a covert attempt to support legislative requirements for speed governors in all vehicles. The IIHS report was not a new study, being an analysis of existing data from the national Fatal <b>Accident</b> <b>Reporting</b> System. The methodology consisted of a comparison of fatalities for different styles of motorcycles based on a rate per 10,000 registrations. The report did not incorporate key factors, such as the number of miles the bike was ridden, the traffic environment in which it was used, along with the age and experience of the rider, among others.|$|E
40|$|This {{study has}} {{investigated}} {{factors that contribute}} to the rise of accidents in the Swedish Armed Forces. Through investigation of six <b>accident</b> <b>reports</b> human factors have been identified, classi-fied and compiled. The aim has been to seek answers to the question: Which human factors cause accidents in the Swedish Armed Forces' activities at sea? In the context of a case study the content of six <b>accident</b> <b>reports,</b> which were linked to the Swedish Armed Forces, was analysed. Documentary research was used to collect data. The analysis of collected <b>accident</b> <b>reports</b> was carried out with content analysis. A total of 134 human factors were identified in this study, compiled from 31 unique human factors. The results drawn from studying the survey concluded that human factors which appear most frequently in the <b>accident</b> <b>reports</b> are routine deviation, judgment, knowledge, sudden event development and communica-tion/information. The results also show that of all the 31 units of human factors identified, no single factor is represented in all <b>accident</b> <b>reports.</b> However, the human factors routine deviation, judgment, communication/information, education, job description and safeguard were repre-sented in five of six reports...|$|R

50|$|The first National Contingency Plan was {{developed}} and published in 1968 {{in response to a}} massive oil spill from the oil tanker Torrey Canyon off the coast of England that occurred a year earlier. More than 37 million gallons of crude oil spilled into the water and caused massive environmental damage. To avoid the problems faced by response officials involved in the incident, U.S. officials developed a coordinated approach to cope with potential spills in U.S. waters. The 1968 plan provided the first comprehensive system of <b>accident</b> <b>reporting,</b> spill containment, and cleanup. It also established a response headquarters, a national reaction team, and regional reaction teams (precursors to the current National Response Team and Regional Response Teams).|$|E
5000|$|Milestones are {{constructed}} to provide reference {{points along the}} road. This {{can be used to}} reassure travellers that the proper path is being followed, and to indicate either distance travelled or the remaining distance to a destination. Such references are also used by maintenance engineers and emergency services to direct them to specific points where their presence is required. This term is sometimes used to denote a location on a road even if no physical sign is present. This is useful for <b>accident</b> <b>reporting</b> and other record keeping (e.g., [...] "an accident occurred at the 13 mile mark" [...] even if the road is only marked with a stone once every 10 miles).|$|E

During her tenure, she led a number of accident investigations including the crash of American Airlines Flight 587 in November 2001, dealing with both the highly technical aspects of the investigation as well as the highly charged public interest in the accident. Blakey worked to improve the Board's <b>accident</b> <b>reporting</b> process and increased industry and regulatory responsiveness to NTSB safety recommendations. Additionally, Blakey strengthened the Board's advocacy and outreach programs to promote safer travel throughout all modes of transportation. She also furthered development of the NTSB Academy as an international resource to enhance aviation safety and accident investigations.|$|E

5000|$|According to Metro Manila <b>Accident</b> <b>Reporting</b> and Analysis System (MMARAS) {{data from}} 2008 to 2011 and {{a study of}} the {{severity}} of road crashes in Metro Manila, accidents that involved heavy and multiple vehicles, and an elderly pedestrian (60 years old and above), as well as those that occurred during the evening (7 pm to midnight) and late at night (1 am to 5 am) had significantly higher odds of resulting in a fatal outcome. But when the crash involves a female pedestrian and when the road surface is wet the odds of a fatal outcome are lower. The study found that most accidents involving pedestrians happen on high-speed, high-traffic-volume, multilane roadways, that are surrounded by land uses that generate a mix of heavy vehicular and pedestrian traffic. It was also found that fatal crashes involving pedestrian happen close to different types of transit stations.|$|E
