The Somerset Levels <b>are</b> <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> flooding and the only significant towns are Glastonbury and Street which occupy slightly elevated locations on the Polden Hills.|$|E
5|$|The {{legality}} of the bat'leth in the United States differs between states. In 2009, a replica bat'leth was used in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in two armed robberies. The Colorado Springs Police Department {{said that it was}} a deadly weapon. In New Jersey, bat'leths are considered weapons and <b>are</b> <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> be seized. The Federal Bureau of Investigation discovered and seized a bat'leth as part of a cache of weapons in connection with a $4 million Medicare fraud investigation in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species may}} be {{affected}} by poor weather. Breeding colonies of Brazza's martins in river sandbars <b>are</b> <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> flooding, {{but this does not}} appear to be having a serious impact, and this species appears to be under no immediate threat. Its ability to use degraded habitats also aids its survival. Tropical cyclones present a threat to the Mascarene martin, particularly on the small islands inhabited by the nominate subspecies. The populations on Mauritius and Réunion were badly affected by a six-day cyclone in February 1861, taking many years to recover, but by about 1900 it was reported to be common but local, and in 1973–74 there were 200–400 pairs on Réunion and 70–75 pairs in Mauritius. More recent cyclones, like one in 1980, seem to have had less damaging effects than the 1861 storm. Several species have been lost from the Mascarene islands since human colonisation in the seventeenth century, but the martin and the Mascarene swiftlet occur on all the main islands, and are less vulnerable to the effects of human activities, especially since they can utilise houses for nest sites.|$|E

25|$|Murders {{are almost}} always carried out by members. It is very rare for the Mafia to recruit an {{outsider}} for a single job, and such people <b>are</b> <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> be eliminated soon afterwards because they become expendable liabilities. Mafia violence is most commonly directed at other Mafia families competing for territory and business. Violence {{is more common in}} the Sicilian Mafia than the American Mafia because Mafia families in Sicily are smaller and more numerous, creating a more volatile atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Secret sharing schemes are {{important}} in cloud computing environments. Thus a key can be distributed over many servers by a threshold secret sharing mechanism. The key is then reconstructed when needed. Secret sharing has also been suggested for sensor networks where the links <b>are</b> <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> be tapped by sending the data in shares which makes {{the task of the}} eavesdropper harder. The security in such environments can be made greater by continuous changing of the way the shares are constructed.|$|E
25|$|In an {{emissions}} trading system, permits may be traded by emitters who <b>are</b> <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> hold {{a sufficient number}} of permits in system. Some analysts argue that allowing others to participate in trading, e.g., private brokerage firms, can allow for better management of risk in the system, e.g., to variations in permit prices (Bashmakov et al.., 2001). It may also improve the efficiency of system. According to Bashmakov et al.. (2001), regulation of these other entities may be necessary, as is done in other financial markets, e.g., to prevent abuses of the system, such as insider trading.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a system}} of {{compulsory}} registration under the Trade Union Ordinance (Cap. 332). Under section 5(5) of the Ordinance, the officers of any trade union which fails to register <b>are</b> <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> a fine of $1,000 and imprisonment for six months. The Registrar {{has the power to}} monitor trade union activities through the supervision of union rule books, accounts and related documents. Trade unions are obliged by law to report to the Registrar where there are changes to the rule book, or the offices and branches operated by the trade unions. Such legal limits on the right to form trade unions were criticised by the Hong Kong Human Rights Commission.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{one does}} not work or conduct {{business}} during shiva, although an exception may be made for those whose duties involve pikuach nefesh (doctors, nurses and emergency medical technicians). The {{same is true for}} mourners who <b>are</b> <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> suffer serious economic loss. A mourner may do the minimal amount of work necessary in order to assure the survival of a business, or if his position is important in meeting the needs of the public and no substitute can be found. This includes elected officials whose work is necessary for the citizens. During the shiva period, the mourner is permitted to give instructions on how to handle business in his absence.|$|E
25|$|Individuals of Iranian {{nationality}} {{resident in}} Iran are subject to tax on all their income whether earned in Iran or abroad. Foreign nationals working in Iran are also {{subject to the same}} income tax based on their salary. Non-resident individuals <b>are</b> <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> pay tax only on their Iranian-sourced income. Foreign employees cannot obtain an exit visa from Iran unless they provide proof that they have paid their due taxes, and since they need to obtain an exit permit when their presence in Iran is based on a work permit, the government can easily enforce this rule. The government assumes a certain salary for employees depending on their position and country of origin. The assumed minimum monthly salaries in 2004 range from US$2,500 for unskilled European workers to US$7,000 for European managing directors.|$|E

25|$|Today, all {{funding for}} state {{highways}} and around 50% {{of funding for}} local roads comes directly from road users through the National Land Transport Fund. Road user revenue directed to the fund includes all fuel excise duty on LPG and CNG, around 55% of revenue from fuel excise duty on petrol, all revenue from road user charges (a prepaid distance/weight licence that all vehicles over 3.5 tonnes, and all non petrol/LPG/CNG vehicles <b>are</b> <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> pay) and most non-ACC revenue from motor vehicle registration and licensing fees. In addition, {{in the last three}} years the government has increasingly allocated additional funds to land transport, to the extent that today the total expenditure by the NZ Transport Agency on land transport projects exceeds road tax revenue collected. The remainder of funding for local city and district roads primarily comes from local authority property rates.|$|E
25|$|The school {{continues}} to maintain strong discipline with a strict {{set of rules}} and regulations. Disciplinary measures {{are based on the}} Raffles Online Discipline system, introduced in 2011 and adapted from the Year 5 - 6 Section. Prior to the present system, student records were maintained based on a demerit point system, with Reformative Work Order and detention sessions for repeat offenders. These systems are primarily targeted at petty offences. Current school rules include prohibitions on eating and possessing sweetened drinks outside the canteen, physical activity in school uniform (as opposed to PE attire), and changing in class. The discipline framework is administered by the Discipline Master, in collaboration with the RIPB, for Year 1-4 students, and the Assistant Department Head (ADH) for Discipline for Year 5-6 students. For more serious offences, all male students <b>are</b> <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> receive corporal punishment in the form of caning if necessary.|$|E
25|$|Under the Lebanese {{employment}} system, recruitment agencies <b>are</b> <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> {{provide a}} replacement {{within the first}} three months after a migrant domestic worker decides to discontinue work. These first three months are a preliminary “trial period”. In order to minimize having to do this, agencies advice employers to take measures to limit the freedom of the migrant domestic workers through the confiscation of their passport and restrict their communication with the outside world. Recruitment agencies have been known to encourage employers to place restrictions on migrant domestic workers which include the confiscation of their passport and confinement to the residence. Recruitment agencies in Lebanon receive very little state supervision. A Human Rights Watch report found that workers are often made false promises about the country they are moving to, as well as the work they will do, and the conditions expected in the workplace. They are also misled about the salaries they can expect to receive.|$|E
