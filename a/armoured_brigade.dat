5|$|By mid-1944 the 4th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> {{was located}} in Southport, Queensland. As of 1 June, the brigade had a {{strength}} of 4,719 men and {{was scheduled to be}} ready for offensive operations by October that year. During June it also established a training area at Nerang in Queensland, where armoured units could practice operating in tropical conditions. In September 1944 the brigade gained the 2/1st <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> Reconnaissance Squadron when the 1st <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> Group was disbanded; this unit was reorganised to become the Armoured Squadron (Special Equipment) in January 1945. The 2/6th Armoured Regiment was also reassigned to the 4th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade,</b> but was stationed in the Sydney area. Following the disbandment of the 1st <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> Group the 4th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> was the last remaining <b>armoured</b> <b>brigade</b> in the Australian Army.|$|E

5|$|The {{units of}} the 4th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> were {{concentrated}} at Singleton, New South Wales, on 10 March 1943. As of April that year, the brigade formed part of the Land Headquarters Reserve. The 1st Army Tank Battalion was subsequently transferred to Caboolture in southern Queensland and reorganised as a self-supporting battalion group while remaining part of the 4th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade.</b> The unit was redesignated the 1st Tank Battalion on 10 June 1943, and in August that year was shipped to Milne Bay in New Guinea. It subsequently supported the 9th Division during the Landing at Lae and Huon Peninsula campaign. The 1st Tank Battalion returned to Australia in June 1944 and was redesignated again to become the 1st Armoured Regiment. In the meantime the 2/4th Armoured Regiment {{was added to the}} 4th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> in October 1943; this unit had previously formed part of the 3rd Armoured Division and was re-equipped with Matilda II tanks. Also in October 1943, a party from the 4th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> armed with pistols was sent to Grovely Camp near Brisbane to put down a riot by soldiers being held under detention there, but did not need to use force. During March 1944 the 2/6th Armoured Regiment was transferred to the 1st <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> Group, and the 2/5th Armoured Regiment was transferred from that formation to the 4th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade.</b>|$|E

5|$|The 4th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> was {{established}} in February 1943 {{as part of a}} reorganisation of the Australian Army's armoured units. As there was no longer any threat of Japanese forces invading Australia, the 2nd Armoured Division was disbanded to free up manpower for other purposes. However, it was decided to retain the headquarters of that division's 6th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> to command armoured units that were intended to take part in offensive operations in New Guinea and other locations in the South West Pacific. This specialised formation was designated the 4th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade.</b> The need for armoured support of infantry forces had been demonstrated by the Army's experiences in the New Guinea Campaign during 1942 and early 1943.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rest}} of the morning, an {{infantry}} battalion from the 22nd <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> group, took up defensive positions in the town; the troops at Point 213 had been cut off and a force was assembled to extricate them. The relief force was unable to advance on the ridge, and when more German forces arrived between 11:00 and 13:00 the trapped squadron surrendered. More German troops had arrived, and engaged the 22nd <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> group along the road back to Livry.|$|E
5|$|Most of the 4th Armoured Brigade's {{units were}} rapidly disbanded {{following}} the war. The 2/1st Armoured Amphibious Squadron was dissolved in August 1945, and the Armoured Squadron (Special Equipment) followed in October that year. The 4th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> headquarters and 2/5th and 2/6th Armoured Regiments were disbanded in February 1946, and the 2/9th Armoured Regiment {{during the early}} part of the year. Only the 1st Armoured Regiment remained an active unit, and returned to its pre-war designation of the 1st Royal New South Wales Lancers in 1949. Volunteers from the 4th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> manned the 1st Armoured Car Squadron, which was established in 1946 for service with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan; in 1949 this squadron was expanded to form the 1st Armoured Regiment, which remains an active part of the Australian Army. A memorial to the 4th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> was dedicated at Caboolture in 1993.|$|E

5|$|The brigade's main role {{throughout}} its existence {{was to provide}} a pool of armoured units and sub-units that could be deployed to augment infantry forces. It was also responsible for developing specialised variants of armoured vehicles. Elements of the 4th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> were detached to support most of the Australian Army's major operations from 1943 {{until the end of the}} war, and from September 1944 it was the Army's only <b>armoured</b> <b>brigade.</b> The formation was disbanded, after the war, in February 1946.|$|E
5|$|General General Bernard Montgomery (commanding {{the ground}} forces in Normandy), wanted {{an attack on}} the eastern flank of the front to capture Falaise, {{intending}} that such a move would precipitate a general German collapse. The First Canadian Army (Lieutenant General Harry Crerar), held this part of the Allied front. It consisted of the British I Corps, responsible for the extreme eastern flank of the Allied lines and II Canadian Corps (Lieutenant General Guy Simonds) south of Caen. The II Canadian Corps, which was to launch Operation Totalize consisted of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division, 1st Polish Armoured Division, 2nd Canadian <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> and the British 33rd <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Canadian II Corps—commanded by Lieutenant-General Guy Simonds—initially {{assigned}} two infantry {{divisions and}} one <b>armoured</b> <b>brigade</b> to {{the assault on}} the German positions around Verrières. The Canadian 3rd Infantry Division—having taken heavy casualties during the first six weeks of the Normandy campaign—was given a supporting role. The onus of the task therefore fell on the fresh, though relatively inexperienced, Canadian 2nd Infantry Division, along with the tanks of the Canadian 2nd <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade.</b> Additional forces were later made available in the shape of three divisions from the British I Corps: the 51st (Highland) Division, the Guards Armoured Division, and the British 7th Armoured Division. Despite having significantly more combat experience than their Canadian counterparts, the British units played a minor part in the battle.|$|E

5|$|The main {{role of the}} 4th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> was {{to provide}} {{detachments}} of tanks to support infantry units. As it was not practical or necessary to deploy large armoured units in the jungle terrain common across the South West Pacific, the brigade was organised into several self-supporting regimental groups. These regimental groups could in turn provide sub-units with the necessary logistics support to form the armoured component of other units during combat operations. This held in practice; during combat deployments regiments from the 4th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> were attached to infantry divisions or brigades, and their squadrons and troops generally operated independently as part of combined arms forces.|$|E
5|$|Believing the German {{attacks on}} 29 June {{indicated}} more counter-attacks {{for the following}} day, Dempsey reinforced the Odon bridgehead with a brigade of the 43rd division and pulled in its perimeter. The 159th Infantry Brigade of the 11th Armoured Division was placed {{under the command of}} the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division and acceding to O’Connor’s wishes for additional infantry, Dempsey attached the newly arrived 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division to VIII Corps; the lead brigade arrived near the Epsom start line during the night. To hold Hill 112, it was necessary hold Évrecy and Hill 113 for which there were insufficient troops and Dempsey ordered the 29th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> to abandon the hill. To hold the area between Rauray and the Odon, Dempsey withdrew the 29th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> north across the river after dark, ready for the expected German offensive.|$|E
5|$|By July 1945 {{the only}} {{elements}} of the 4th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> in Australia were the unit's headquarters, the 2/5th and 2/6th Armoured Regiments and the 2/1st Armoured Amphibious Squadron. The two regiments were preparing for offensive operations, including a planned but later cancelled invasion of Java, but did not leave Australia.|$|E

50|$|The 31st Indian Armoured Division was an {{armoured}} {{division of the}} Indian Army during World War II, formed in 1940, originally as the 1st Indian Armoured Division; it consisted of units of the British Army and the British Indian Army. When it was raised, it consisted of two <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigades</b> (the 1st and 2nd Indian <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigades)</b> and one Motor Brigade (the 3rd Indian Motor Brigade).|$|R
5|$|During 1944 the 4th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> {{provided}} crews for comparative {{trials of}} the American M4 Sherman and British Churchill tank in New Guinea conditions that were conducted by the Australian Army {{in response to a}} request from the British War Office. Macarthur-Onslow proposed including other tanks in these trials, including a British Cromwell that had been shipped to Australia in 1943, but this did not occur. Before the tanks were sent to New Guinea, the 4th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> trialled two Sherman tanks alongside Grants and Matilda IIs in Queensland during mid-1944. The Churchills and Shermans were subsequently trialled in the Madang region of New Guinea; the Churchill proved better suited to jungle conditions. The Australian Army later ordered 510 Churchills, but none were delivered {{before the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|In early March 1941, the 2nd New Zealand Division (including Div Cav) was {{earmarked}} for W Force, the British Commonwealth force sent to Greece to bolster its defence against imminent German invasion. The regiment embarked for Greece on 18 March 1941 on the Greek ship Ionia, with its vehicles aboard the cargo ship Anglo-Canadian. The ships arrived at Piraeus on 21 March and the troops {{stayed at the}} transit camp at Kifisia. The regiment advanced northward, reaching its position on the Aliakmon Line near Katerini on 26 March. Its mission was to destroy the Aliakmon River bridges, delaying the German advance. E Troop of the 5th Field Regiment and O Troop of the 7th Anti-Tank Regiment were attached to the regiment. On 4 April, the regiment sent two troops of Marmon-Harrington armoured cars to reinforce the British 1st <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> on the Macedonian plain; in exchange, the regiment received seven cruiser tanks. The two troops withdrew with the 1st <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> when it retreated on 8 April and reached Perdikkas by the following day. The regiment and E Troop, 5th Field Regiment, were the only units left on the plain between Mount Olympus and the Aliakmon on 8 April. The next day, A Squadron demolished the main bridge across the Aliakmon, after the 1st <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> had withdrawn southward.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April, the JNA {{established}} a buffer zone {{to separate the}} belligerents at Plitvice Lakes, deploying elements of the 1st and the 5th Military Districts. Those were an armoured battalion of the 329th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> based in Banja Luka, a battalion of the 6th Mountain Brigade based in Delnice, a reconnaissance company and a mechanised battalion of the 4th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> based in Jastrebarsko and Karlovac, a battalion of the 306th Light Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment based in Zagreb, a signals company of the 367th Signals Regiment based in Samobor, a company of the 13th Military Police Battalion based in Rijeka and an anti-aircraft artillery battery drawn from the 13th Proletarian Motorised Brigade based in Rijeka. Finally, the 5th Military District set up a forward command post at the Plitvice Lakes. The JNA force at the Plitvice Lakes was commanded by Colonel Ivan Štimac.|$|E
50|$|The forces {{involved}} in the battle were the American 1st Infantry Division, the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Armored Division (Fwd) ('Hell on Wheels') and the Iraqi 18th Mechanized and 9th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigades</b> of the Republican Guard Tawakalna Mechanized Infantry Division along with elements from eleven other Iraqi divisions including the Iraqi 26th, 48th, 31st, and 25th Infantry Divisions. The Iraqi 52nd Armoured Division was also a participant. The Iraqi 10th and 12th Armoured Divisions were also present. The Iraqis also had elements of two other independent <b>armoured</b> <b>brigades</b> in theatre, those being the 50th and 29th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigades.</b> The British fielded their 1st Armoured Division. The U.S. 3rd Armored Division handled responsibilities at Objective Dorset.|$|R
25|$|By 1939, the {{intention}} was for an Armoured Division {{to consist of}} two <b>armoured</b> <b>brigades,</b> a support group and divisional troops. The <b>armoured</b> <b>brigades</b> would each be composed of three armoured regiments {{with a mixture of}} light and medium tanks, with a total complement of 220 tanks, while the support group would be composed of two motorised infantry battalions, two field artillery regiments, one anti–tank regiment and one light anti–aircraft regiment.|$|R

5|$|On {{the night}} of 1/2 November 1942, the Eighth Army {{attacked}} again in the north, with 2nd New Zealand Division in the lead. Freyberg placed 151 Brigade {{on the right and}} 152 Brigade on the left. The aim was to attack directly westwards across the Rahman track, with the infantry leading the night assault and 9th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> (now commanded by Brigadier John C. Currie) again passing through to break the enemy gun line and allow X Corps to break out. The assault went to plan except that opposition on the left was heavier than expected which slowed the advance. As a result, the advancing tanks were highlighted against the dawn sky in the east and began to be picked off by Axis anti-tank fire. The Regiment was in the centre of the 9th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade,</b> and the CO lost touch with both his artillery support and close anti-tank support. In the growing light, the B squadron commander (Major M.StJ.V.Gibbs) realised that he was in a ring of enemy anti-tank guns, ahead and to both flanks. He gave the order to 'Charge' and B Squadron overran the anti-tank positions, losing some vehicles but destroying the enemy gun line. Meanwhile, the 21st Panzer Division was counter-attacking A and C Squadrons and at 4pm the Regiment (now down to four tanks) was withdrawn. The 1st Armoured Division from X Corps were just behind the 9th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> but there were no liaison officers between the units and 1st Armoured did not take the opportunity to push on through the broken Axis gun-line.|$|E
5|$|The 4th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade</b> was an {{armoured}} {{formation of}} the Australian Army established during the Second World War. It was formed in February 1943 to provide armoured support for infantry units operating in the South West Pacific Area. Its composition varied over time, but usually comprised several armoured regiments equipped with Matilda II or M3 Grant tanks {{as well as some}} support units.|$|E
5|$|As the war progressed, the New Zealand {{government}} decided {{to form an}} <b>armoured</b> <b>brigade</b> to provide tank support to the 2nd New Zealand Division. As a result, the 1st New Zealand Army Tank Brigade was formed in New Zealand. This brigade was still undergoing training in September when {{it was decided to}} convert the 4th Brigade to armour instead, thus creating the 4th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigade.</b> Personnel were transferred from the tank brigade in New Zealand to bring the 4th Brigade back up to strength. As one of the constituent units of the brigade, the 18th Battalion was officially re-designated the 18th Armoured Regiment, with three squadrons of tanks, on 5 October 1942. One squadron was to be equipped with Crusaders with the other two squadrons would operate Shermans. The regiment spent much of the next year in training under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Clive Pleasants, who had taken over command after the death of Lynch. By May 1943, many of the regiment's personnel had been on active duty for well over three years, and the majority of these men were returned to New Zealand on furlough.|$|E
50|$|Several exits {{were open}} {{within an hour}} of the first landings, {{allowing}} the <b>Armoured</b> <b>Brigades</b> to start moving inland.|$|R
50|$|Sweden fielded four Type 63 <b>armoured</b> <b>brigades.</b> Each brigade had around 5,600 men {{and they}} were {{concentrated}} in the country's South.|$|R
50|$|From 1943, Stuart tanks (both M3 and M5) {{had their}} turrets removed and seating fitted to carry {{infantry}} troops attached to British <b>armoured</b> <b>brigades.</b>|$|R
