5|$|Ideal tank mates for convict {{cichlids}} {{consists of}} robust similar sized fish. Such fish include T-Bar cichlids, Honduran red points, Green Terrors, Jewel cichlids, Salvini, Jack Dempsey, (Keep {{in mind as}} Dempseys outgrow the convicts territorial issues will become a problem.) Pictus catfish, plecostomus, {{as well as other}} convicts. Other fast moving fish such as Giant Danios can be used as dither fish. <b>Also</b> <b>remember,</b> if you have a breeding pair Convicts in a 40-gallon or smaller you will be most likely be unable to keep the convicts with any tank mates. But if your tank mates have established any type of dominance they will however breed and live together.|$|E
25|$|The center-lock {{wire wheel}} is {{traditionally}} associated with vintage sports cars and racing cars, {{and for those}} of us of advancing years the blood is still stirred by memories of split-seconds saved by the deft application of copper-headed hammers to eared hubcaps.

25|$|Sometimes, as in {{the triumphant}} Song of Deborah found in the Biblical Book of Judges, these songs {{celebrate}} victory. Laments for lost battles and wars, and the lives lost in them, are equally prominent in many traditions; these laments keep alive the cause for which the battle was fought. The narratives of traditional songs often <b>also</b> <b>remember</b> folk heroes such as John Henry or Robin Hood. Some traditional song narratives recall supernatural events or mysterious deaths.|$|E

25|$|Joule was {{proposing a}} kinetic theory of heat (he {{believed}} {{it to be}} a form of rotational, rather than translational, kinetic energy), and this required a conceptual leap: if heat was a form of molecular motion, why didn't the motion of the molecules gradually die out? Joule's ideas required one to believe that the collisions of molecules were perfectly elastic. We should <b>also</b> <b>remember</b> that the very existence of atoms and molecules was not widely accepted for another 50 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{events in}} a life script are often positive, celebrated, and normative. It {{represents}} and idealized life story. An average life would also include negative events and people would learn from experience. But the life script is handed down from older generations, through stories, and observations {{of the behavior of}} others, typically older, people within the same culture. Individuals should <b>also</b> <b>remember</b> more during their young adulthood because that era is the time of biological maturation, new experiences, adult identity formation, and major events in life scripts.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 {{expectations}} were high that Waterford would retain their Munster title and {{challenge for the}} All-Ireland once again. After a disappointing National League campaign and a nine-point loss to Clare {{in the first round}} of the championship a players meeting was held where it was indicated that some of the team no longer wanted McCarthy in charge. From that another meeting with the County Board was held where McCarthy resigned as manager. McCarthy had a successful reign over Waterford and most will remember all the great games that he was involved in but will <b>also</b> <b>remember</b> the fact that Waterford never reached an All-Ireland final under him.|$|E

25|$|In 2000, the Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania in Sibiu {{decided to}} back {{him as a}} {{candidate}} for mayor. Despite the fact that Sibiu's German minority had shrunken to a mere 1.6%, Iohannis was elected with 69.18% of the votes and has won three re-elections in a row, getting some of the largest electoral scores in the country: 88.7% of the vote in 2004, and 87.4% in 2008. He is the first ethnic German mayor of a Romanian city since Albert Dörr, who served from 1940 to 1945. The small German minority is popular in Romania, where they are often viewed as hard-working, precise and uncompromising. Many Romanians <b>also</b> <b>remember</b> that the country experienced some of its best moments under German kings over a century ago.|$|E
25|$|Finding {{historical}} {{sources for}} The Mercenary War {{suffers from the}} same problem as any history of Carthage: Few primary sources of Carthaginian history exist, except as fragments in translation quoted by Roman and Greek historians. The main extant account of the Mercenary War is that of Polybius, a Greek historian writing many years after the events portrayed here. While {{it is likely that}} he based much of his account on now-lost works of prior Greek and Roman historians, it is unlikely that they had an unbiased view of Carthage and its history. When reading such history it is wise to take this into account. We have the best historical reconstruction that we can derive, but we must <b>also</b> <b>remember</b> that its balance and objectivity is in question.|$|E
25|$|Nigamananda {{said that}} one should {{remember}} that death is coming. Before working on good or evil deeds one should <b>also</b> <b>remember</b> that death is not far off. Contemplating death drives away the desire for sensual pleasure and evil thoughts and stops acts of injustice. Attachment to wealth and relations will then diminish. Earthly matters remain even after departure from this world. Only spiritual wealth remains as an asset to the individual. Those who have puffed with pride on account of their accomplishments will submit to the God of death meekly when that hour comes. Drunk with pride, some persons ill-treat their brethren. They will {{be left in the}} deserted crematory ground with the beasts and birds joyously waiting to feast upon their flesh. Thinking of this will drive evil thoughts from the mind.|$|E

25|$|For {{a simple}} example, take the {{presentation}} {a | a3}. Writing A for the inverse of a, we have possible strings combining {{any number of}} the symbols a and A. Whenever we see aaa, or aA or Aa we may strike these out. We should <b>also</b> <b>remember</b> to strike out AAA; this says that since the cube of a is the identity element of G, so is the cube of the inverse of a. Under these conditions the word problem becomes easy. First reduce strings to the empty string, a, aa, A or AA. Then note that we may also multiply by aaa, so we can convert A to aa and convert AA to a. The {{result is that the}} word problem, here for the cyclic group of order three, is solvable.|$|E
25|$|The Reims Campaign, {{following}} which {{peace was}} finally achieved with the Treaty of Brétigny. But, {{on the same}} terms, England was left with {{about a third of}} France rather than a little under half which they would have received through the Treaty of London. This is due to the failure to take Reims which led to the need for a safe passage out of France. As a result, a lesser treaty was agreed to and Edward III was obliged to drop his claims to the French throne. France was still forced to pay a huge ransom of around four times France's gross annual domestic product for John the Good. The ransom paid was, however, a little short of that demanded by the English, and John the Good was not returned to the French. Thus, this campaign yielded mixed results, but was mostly positive for Edward. One must <b>also</b> <b>remember</b> Edward III never actually dropped his claim to the throne, and that about half of France was controlled by the English anyway through many vassals.|$|E

500|$|Milk {{became more}} {{interested}} in political and civic matters when he was faced with civic problems and policies he disliked. One day in 1973, a state bureaucrat entered Milk's shop Castro Camera and informed him that he owed $100 as a deposit against state sales tax. Milk was incredulous and traded shouts with the man about the rights of business owners; after he complained for weeks at state offices, the deposit was reduced to $30. Milk fumed about government priorities when a teacher came into his store to borrow a projector because the equipment in the schools did not function. Friends <b>also</b> <b>remember</b> {{around the same time}} having to restrain him from kicking the television while Attorney General John N. Mitchell gave consistent [...] "I don't recall" [...] replies during the Watergate hearings. Milk decided that {{the time had come to}} run for city supervisor. He said later, [...] "I finally reached the point where I knew I had to become involved or shut up".|$|E

500|$|Two filmed {{scenes from}} [...] "The One with the Cast of Night Court" [...] were cut {{out from the}} airing. Instead, the scenes were {{featured}} on 30 Rocks season 3 DVD {{as part of the}} deleted scenes in the Bonus feature. In the first scene, Liz and Jenna recall their wild nights with Claire, including when Jenna and Claire danced around an opened fire hydrant, while Liz tells them that she does not feel safe. They <b>also</b> <b>remember</b> when they crashed a Polish wedding, in which Claire is seen dancing around a group of men. In the second scene, Harry Anderson is in Tracy's dressing room, after leaving rehearsal. Tracy enters to convince him to make up with Markie Post. In another room, Kenneth is seen with Markie Post. Anderson complains to Tracy about Post, as does Post about Anderson to Kenneth. Tracy tells him to forget about the past and fulfill Kenneth's dreams of a Night Court wedding to make Kenneth happy, as he is displeased with the new page uniforms he is forced to wear.|$|E
500|$|The Russian {{characters}} {{from the start}} of the episode came from a [...] "great" [...] Russian acting community in Vancouver, British Columbia who had defected from the Soviet Union. Both Lea and Laurie Holden were required to learn Russian for the first scene following the opening credits. Alex Shostak Jr., who portrayed Dmitri, worked 12–14 hours a day; make-up was applied to give the appearance that his eyes and mouth had been sewed up, and a small straw was pushed between his lips to give him water. During the filming of the episode, he was [...] "literally" [...] blind and guided by the crew members throughout the filming of his scenes. Shostak provided the translation for his own lines from English to Russian. Holden and Lea worked diligently together to perfect their lines in Russian. Holden explained, [...] "we'd come up with these fun ways to test ourselves to know if we had really nailed it. Show tunes come to mind, but I <b>also</b> <b>remember</b> this one time my dialect coach had me call a Russian friend of his on his cell phone to see if he could understand me. I passed the test." ...|$|E
