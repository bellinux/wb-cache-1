5|$|Despite {{the declining}} {{prevalence}} of marriage, {{more than three-quarters}} of Americans will marry at least once in their lifetime. The average age for marriage for a male was 26.8 and 25.1 for a female. Americans <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> remarry after their first divorce. In 1990, 40% of all marriages were remarriages. All together one can conclude that while there is no prevalent average household arrangement, most Americans (the average Joe) will get married and divorced once with a considerable number of Americans remarrying at least once.|$|E
5|$|Despite Malawi's limited {{health and}} {{educational}} infrastructure, knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS is high among many {{people living in}} both urban and rural Malawi. According to a 2004 study by Barden-O'Fallon et al. involving 100 households, women in Malawi {{are most likely to}} learn about HIV/AIDS through radio and television, health workers at local clinics, and female members of their social networks. Men <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> access information about HIV/AIDS through radio and television; however, unlike women, they are not likely to gain information about HIV/AIDS from their male friends. When 57 Malawian men were interviewed in 2003, 100% of them said they had heard about the HIV/AIDS epidemic on the radio, and 84.2% of them said they had learned about HIV/AIDS during their visits to local health facilities; this supports the fact that many people in Malawi have access to information about the epidemic, both through the radio and other sources.|$|E

5|$|Ifs covers {{during the}} 1960s were {{typically}} action-oriented, showing monsters and aliens; {{and several of}} the stories Pohl published were directed at a younger audience. For example, Blish's Welcome to Mars, serialized under the title The Hour Before Earthrise in July to September 1966, was about a teenage genius whose antigravity device stranded him and his girlfriend on Mars. Ashley has suggested that If was attempting to acquire readership from the many new fans of science fiction who had been introduced to the genre through television, in particular via the popular 1960s shows Doctor Who and Star Trek. If also ran a friendly letter column, with more fan-oriented discussions than the other magazines, and between 1966 and 1968 a column by Lin Carter introduced readers to various aspects of science fiction fandom. These features <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have appealed to a younger audience.|$|E
5|$|Of {{near miss}} events, {{obstetrical}} fistulae (OF), including vesicovaginal and rectovaginal fistulae, remain {{one of the}} most serious and tragic. Although corrective surgery is possible it is often not available and OF is considered completely preventable. If repaired, subsequent pregnancies will require cesarian section. While unusual in developed countries, it is estimated that up to 100,000 cases occur every year in the world, and that about 2 million women are currently living with this condition, with the highest incidence occurring in Africa and parts of Asia. OF results from prolonged obstructed labor without intervention, when continued pressure from the fetus in the birth canal restricts blood supply to the surrounding tissues, with eventual fetal death, necrosis and expulsion. The damaged pelvic organs then develop a connection (fistula) allowing urine or feces, or both, to be discharged through the vagina with associated urinary and fecal incontinence, vaginal stenosis, nerve damage and infertility. Severe social and mental consequences <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> follow, with shunning of the women. Aprt from lack of access to care, causes include young age, and malnourishment. The UNFPA has made prevention of OF a priority and is the lead agency in the Campaign to End Fistula, which issues annual reports and the United Nations observes May 23 as the International Day to End Obstetric Fistula every year. Prevention includes discouraging teenage pregnancy and child marriage, adeaquate nutrition, and access to skilled care, including caesarian section.|$|E

25|$|For example: Dizygotic (DZ) twin births are {{affected}} by many factors. Some women frequently produce more than one egg at each menstrual period and, therefore, {{are more likely to}} have twins. This tendency may run in the family either in the mother's or father's side of the family, and often runs through both. Women over the age of 35 are more likely to produce two eggs. Women who have three or more children <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have dizygotic twins. Artificial induction of ovulation and in vitro fertilization-embryo replacement can also give rise to fraternal and identical twins.|$|E
25|$|While {{nuclear power}} {{does not produce}} {{significant}} carbon dioxide in generation (though the construction, mining, waste handling and disposal, and decommissioning do generate some carbon emissions), it raises other environmental and security concerns. Despite this, it has enormous potential for generating electricity, when it is taken into consideration that uranium could last up to a hundred years. However, even with changes to the planning system to speed applications, there are doubts over whether the necessary timescale could be met, and over the financial viability of nuclear power with present oil and gas prices. With no nuclear plants having been constructed since Sizewell B in 1995, there <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be capacity issues within the native nuclear industry. The existing privatised nuclear supplier, British Energy, had been in financial trouble in 2004.|$|E

25|$|The {{selection}} {{of individuals to}} be assigned to specific teams bears on the resulting effectiveness of those teams. Aspects of team composition {{that should be considered}} during the team selection process include team members' knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) as well their personalities and attitudes. To achieve high-quality results, teams built with members having higher skill levels {{are more likely to be}} effective than teams built around members having lesser skills; teams that include a members with a diversity of skills <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> show improved team performance. Additionally, higher levels of cognitive ability of team members has been shown to consistently correlate to increased work group effectiveness. Team members' personalities and attitudes have also been studied. For example, the personality factors agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and emotional stability are related to better team performance.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} main phases of biofilm {{development}} and rhamnolipids are implicated in each phase. Rhamnolipids {{are reported to}} promote motility, thereby inhibiting attachment by preventing cells from adhering tightly to the substratum. During biofilm development, rhamnolipids are reported to create and maintain fluid channels for water and oxygen flow {{around the base of}} the biofilm. Furthermore, they are important for forming structure in biofilms; a rhlA mutant forms a flat biofilm. Biofilm dispersal is dependent on Rhammnolipids, however other factors such as degradation of the matrix and activation of motility <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be necessary. It has been shown using fluorescence microscopy that the rhlAB operon is induced in the centre of the mushroom cap, followed by dispersal of cells from the polysaccharide matrix from the centre of these caps causing a cavity to form. A mutation in rhlA causes a failure in formation of mushroom caps at all.|$|E
25|$|Just as higher-income {{groups are}} more likely to enjoy {{financial}} gains when economic times are good, they <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> suffer more significant income losses during economic downturns and recessions when they are compared to lower income groups. Higher-income groups tend to derive relatively more of their income from more volatile sources related to capital income (business income, capital gains, and dividends), as opposed to labor income (wages and salaries). For example, in 2011 the top 1% of income earners derived 37% of their income from labor income, versus 62% for the middle quintile. On the other hand, the top 1% derived 58% of their income from capital as opposed to 4% for the middle quintile. Government transfers represented only 1% of the income of the top 1% but 25% for the middle quintile; the dollar amounts of these transfers tend to rise in recessions.|$|E

25|$|Recent bear {{attacks on}} humans have been {{reported}} from Junbesi and Langtang National Park in Nepal, and occurred in villages {{as well as in}} the surrounding forest. Li Guoxing, the second person in history to have received a facial transplant, was a victim of a black bear attack. Nine people were killed by black bears in Japan between 1979–1989, and more recently, in September 2009 it was reported that a black bear attacked a group of tourists, seriously injuring four, while they were waiting at a bus station in the built-up area of Takayama, Gifu in central Japan. The majority of attacks tend to occur when black bears are encountered suddenly, and in close quarters. Because of this, black bears are generally considered more dangerous than sympatric brown bears, which live in more open spaces and are thus less likely to be surprised by approaching humans. They <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> attack when protecting food.|$|E

2500|$|Research {{shows that}} {{behavioral}} immune system, the psychological processes that infer infection risk from perceptual cues {{and respond to}} these perceptual cues through the activation of aversive emotions, [...] may influence gregariousness.
