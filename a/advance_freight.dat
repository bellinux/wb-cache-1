40|$|Abstract. Within the North American freight {{railroad}} industry, {{there is}} currently an effort to enable more intelligent telemetry for freight trains. By enabling greater visibility of their rolling stock, including locomotives and rail-road cars, railroad companies hope to improve their asset utilization, opera-tional safety, and business profitability. Different communication and sensing technologies are being explored and one candidate technology is wireless sensor networks (WSN). In this article, we present Sensor-Enabled Ambient-Intelligent Telemetry for Trains (SEAIT), which is a WSN-based approach to supporting sensing and communications for <b>advanced</b> <b>freight</b> transportation scenarios. As part of a proof-of-technology exploration, SEAIT was designed to address key requirements of industry proposed applications. We introduce several of these applications and highlight the challenges, which include high end-to-end reliability over many hops, low-latency delivery of emergency alerts, and accurate identification of train composition. We present the architec-ture of SEAIT and evaluate it against these requirements using an experimental deployment...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{relationship}} between the amount of transported goods and economic activities by industries is investigated. Using historical EUROSTAT supply-use tables for Germany, we developed an economic indicator with which the interdependency between 59 industries (NACE classified) their 59 products (CPA classified) and the amount of 24 types of transported goods (NST/R classified) can be shown. In the results, we can observe a strong interdependency between the majority of the transported goods and the developed economic indicator. This enables us to explain statistically about 91 % of the amount of the transported goods by economic activity in Germany. Therefore we can state that the developed indicator is suited to translate economic activity into freight transportation. On the one hand, the findings might contribute to the coupling/decoupling discussion. Using the developed indicator we see how coupled the transport volume to economic development really is. On the other hand, the outcome and the developed economic indicator are highly relevant for the freight modelling community because the proper translation of economic activity into freight transportation is still a challenge. Models without an explicit freight generation module can use the economic indicator to derive the transport demand from economic development. Models with an <b>advanced</b> <b>freight</b> generation approach such as SCGE or MRIO can use the method to obtain a control variable for their model outcomes...|$|R

Are you aware that the master of a ship has charge of all the cash in hand, pays the men <b>advances,</b> receives <b>freight</b> and passage-money, and runs up bills in every port? All this he does as the owner's confidential agent, and his integrity is proved by his receipted bills. I tell you, the captain of a ship {{is more likely to}} forget his pants than these bills which guarantee his character. I've known men drown to save them--bad men, too; but this is the shipmaster's honour. And here this Captain Trent--not hurried, not threatened with anything but a free passage in a British man-of-war--has left them all behind.

The new association decreed (for this was before all the outsiders had been taken into the pilots' association) that if any captain employed a non-association pilot, he {{should be forced to}} discharge him, and also pay a fine of five hundred dollars. Several of these heavy fines were paid before the captains' organization grew strong enough to exercise full authority over its membership; but that all ceased, presently. The captains tried to get the pilots to decree that no member of their corporation should serve under a non-association captain; but this proposition was declined. The pilots saw that they would be backed up by the captains and the underwriters anyhow, and so they wisely refrained from entering into entangling alliances.|$|R

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{sustainable}} logistic and supply chain processes poses enormous challenges {{in terms of}} technology integration, {{the development of new}} business models, cultural change and job qualification, and as such requires a real paradigm shift. In this paper, we start with a brief sketch of how modern logistics and supply chains emerged as a result of diversification and specialization of industrial production, globally scattered availability of resources and more demanding consumer markets. Jointly with <b>advances</b> in <b>freight</b> transport and communication technologies, these developments have led to the global economy we face today. The strong growth of trade and consumption however also revealed some essential weaknesses of the system that renders current practices in the long run unsustainable—in social, environmental and economic terms (people, planet, profit). Future supply chains should no longer deplete scarce natural resources or contribute to climate change, should avoid environmental pollution and withstand safety and security threats, {{while at the same time}} remaining competitive and satisfying high labor quality standards. This requires not only the application of advanced technologies to mitigate or even neutralize these negative effects, but also the development of smart business models, new job qualification standards and corresponding (lifelong) training and education programs at all levels, including artificial intelligence based learning...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe role of {{information}} and communication technologies (ICTs) in freight transport as key enabler is well recognised. However the uptake of recent ICT <b>advances</b> for multimodal <b>freight</b> transport provisions in the UK and Europe has been slow. The aim of our paper is to explore the potential reasons for such a slow adoption and assess how recent technological advances such as cloud computing and Internet of Things might have changed the landscape and thus help to overcome these barriers. Via an extensive review of 33 EU framework programme projects, we are able to consolidate and present current major efforts in ICT developments in the freight multimodal transport setting at European level. We further discuss barriers inhibiting quick take-up of ICT applications in multimodal transport. Resolutions were then explored by reviewing four key ICT development trends recently emerging and evaluating their potential impact in reducing such barriers for deployment. Our contribution is two-fold: it advances current knowledge by presenting an up-to-date overview of existing and emerging ICT applications in the field of multimodal transport and barriers to e-enabled multimodal transport. It also captures some of the best practices in industry and aims to provoke a debate among practitioners and academics via the analysis of how innovative use of recent technological developments could potentially lower the barriers to multimodal ICT adoption and lead to a more integrated freight transport network. Therefore it lays the foundation for further research...|$|R
40|$|Master of Landscape ArchitectureDepartment of Landscape Architecture/Regional and Community PlanningMary C. Kingery-PageOur water {{bodies have}} {{functioned as a}} {{critical}} transportation network, moving people, raw materials, products and goods across countries and continents. Starting as hubs of shipping, trade, and commerce, water bodies were the center {{of social and economic}} life of early cities. Technological <b>advances</b> in <b>freight</b> transport spelled the eventual demise of urban ports. This transformation has left vast swathes of vacant, urban waterfront property under-used, neglected, and disconnected from cities that once thrived along the water. This under-utilized land is now seen as a resource for revitalizing urban cores. Cities are looking to reclaim their once prosperous waterfronts (Fisher et al. 2004). Detroit’s riverfront has long been plagued by industry and pollution. For the past 25 years, Detroit has been striving to turn its dilapidated shoreline into a thriving public asset. Today, three and a half miles of the Detroit RiverWalk stretching from Joe Louis Arena east to Gabriel Richard Park have been completed and {{is open to the public}} (Brown 2007). Designs are currently being developed to extend the RiverWalk west to Ambassador Bridge, but no studies are planned for the east end toward Water Works Park and beyond(Brown 2007). The existing eastern terminus of Detroit’s RiverWalk does not allow access to the riverfront from neighborhoods that lie to the north and east. Residents have expressed growing interest in extending the RiverWalk and greenway connections to promote use (The Villages Community Development Corporation 2010). How can the Detroit RiverWalk be configured to extend eastward in order to connect neighborhoods and communities to the waterfront, provide amenities in waterfront parks, and create pedestrian greenway linkages? The Detroit riverfront will be accessible to surrounding neighborhoods with the east extension of the RiverWalk, redesign of waterfront parks, and greenway linkages which connect communities with the waterfront and amenities. Humans have a natural attraction to water; therefore “the public increasingly desires and expects access to the water’s edge” (Brown 2007). Pedestrian access is fundamental, particularly linking outlying areas to the water’s edge (Marshall 2001). The RiverWalk extension consists of research of waterfront theory, greenway practices, and the existing riverfront. Critical theory principles and contextual information will be extruded and organized into key components: Extend, Connect, and Provide. These components will outline the analysis, programming, and design phases in order to create a coherent master plan. Detroit can be a precedent for greenway and waterfront development in residential neighborhoods. The Detroit riverfront can be transformed into a public amenity for residents and visitors to benefit, enjoy, and appreciate the power of our fundamental resource: water...|$|R

30|$|Over {{the last}} few decades there has been a {{significant}} growth in freight transport, most of which is served by road freight transport in Europe. In contrast, the share of rail freight transport has either declined or remained stagnant with an exception in a few countries where there is a slight growth in rail freight transport. Apart from the dynamic nature of the road service offering, an important reason of the dominance of road hauliers in the freight transport sector is linked to their ability to deliver certain types of cargo. Types of cargo which have significantly changed from manufacturing inputs, to finished and semi-finished products. These types of cargo require faster, more reliable, door-to-door services and where rail traditionally has an unfavourable position. Road freight transport is the major source of greenhouse gas (ghg) emission, in contrast rail freight transport is seen as an environment friendly transport mode option. The European Commission (EC) at the central level and many member states (e.g. France, Germany, and the UK) at the national level have been trying to encourage the higher usage of rail freight transport (i.e. modal shift in favour of rail) to reduce the environmental effects from the transport sector and reduce road congestion, in particular peak hours [11]. This is demonstrated through the funding of various projects such as; RETRACK -“RETRACK: REorganisation of Transport networks by <b>advanced</b> RAil <b>freight</b> Concepts.” [22]; CREAM – “Technical and operational innovations implemented on a European rail freight corridor) [14], under the sixth Framework Programme [7], and SPECTRUM - “Solutions and Processes to Enhance the Competitiveness of freight Transport by Rail in Unexploited Markets” under seventh Framework Programme [24]. The scope of the research and demonstration under the RETRACK and CREAM projects concerned all cargo types. In contrast the scope of the research and demonstration in the SPECTRUM project focused specifically on the market of low-density high value (LDHV) goods. The research in SPECTRUM project realised at the outset that to achieve modal shift from road it is important to offer a comparable service to road in terms of cost and transhipment time. This is crucial {{in the sense that the}} European rail freight market is ostensibly a free market where, since 1 January 2007 and competition in a competitive environment is an indisputable need for the building of an efficient freight transport sector [5]. With this context in mind, the research in the SPECTRUM project explored four service areas in Europe. It is a fact that to meet the continuous growth, the volume of freight transport and its external costs are rising [4]. The external costs vary significantly between modes. It is important that the full-socio-environmental costs of competing transport mode options are accounted for [25].|$|R
