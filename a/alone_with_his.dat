5|$|Cupid conceals himself, as Theseus and Ariadne {{arrive on}} the island a short {{distance}} away. Ariadne muses over her disloyalty to her father, but declares her love for Theseus. She departs to find shelter for the night, after which a fishermen's chorus compares her eyes with the stars of heaven. Theseus, <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> counsellor, discusses his abandonment of Ariadne, and is advised that this decision is justified, as {{she will not be}} acceptable to the people of Athens as their ruler's consort.|$|E

5|$|As a {{marriage}} gift, the Tsar gave George {{a group of}} islands in the Petalioi Gulf, which the family visited on the royal yacht Amphitrite. George later purchased a country estate, Tatoi, north of Athens, and on Corfu he built a summer villa called Mon Repos. George developed Tatoi, building roads and planting grapes for making his own wine, Chateau Décélie. Intent on not letting his subjects know that he missed Denmark, he discreetly maintained a dairy at his palace at Tatoi, which was managed by native Danes {{and served as a}} bucolic reminder of his homeland. Queen Olga was far less careful in hiding her nostalgia for her native Russia, often visiting Russian ships at Piraeus two or three times before they weighed anchor. When <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> wife, George usually conversed in German. Their children were taught English by their nannies, and when talking with his children he therefore spoke mainly English.|$|E
5|$|Skyler (Anna Gunn) calls Walter {{to inquire}} about buying the car wash where Walter once worked, which they plan {{to use as a}} front {{business}} for Walter's drug money. When Walter fails to act on the purchase, Skyler starts doing her own detailed research about the business's expenses and revenues. She later approaches the car wash owner, Bogdan (Marius Stan), about the proposed purchase, but he angrily rejects her, making sexist remarks and condemning Walter for having insulted Bogdan when he quit the car wash. Meanwhile, Marie (Betsy Brandt) continues struggling to deal with her husband Hank's (Dean Norris) deepening depression as he copes with physical therapy from having been shot. The bed-ridden and bitter Hank constantly ignores or insults Marie and, even after celebrating a successful session with his physical therapist, he refuses to share any of that excitement with Marie. Meanwhile, after three straight days of partying, Jesse tries to keep hanging out with Badger and Skinny Pete, but they are exhausted and go home, along with all of the other guests in Jesse's house. <b>Alone</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> thoughts, a depressed Jesse breaks down and cries, sitting less than an inch away from his speakers at an extremely high volume.|$|E
5|$|The {{compound}} Mahandrihono ("knows how to wait") is {{the most}} expansive and well-preserved of the rova structures at Ambohimanga. It lies {{to the east of}} the central courtyard and sits at a higher elevation than Bevato, symbolically representing its greater political significance. It was first established by Andriambelomasina in the early 18th century during the reign of his father, Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana. Andriambelomasina surrounded the compound with a stone wall and within it built three houses as residences for his children—two twin houses (tranokambana) set side by side named Mahandry ("knows how to wait") and Tsararay ("has a good father"), and a third named Manandraimanjaka ("has a father who rules")—taking pains to illustrate through the names of these houses that {{he had no intention of}} usurping his father. When Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana eventually died, Andriambelomasina entombed him behind the twin houses. In Andrianampoinimerina's time this compound corresponded with the Mahandrihono compound at the rova in Antananarivo, being reserved for the king <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> residence positioned beside the tombs of the ancestors.|$|E

St. Jimmy appears and makes one last attempt to get Johnny's attention, but that part of Johnny has died, {{resulting}} in the metaphorical suicide of St. Jimmy ("The Death of St. Jimmy"). Johnny cleans up and gets a desk job but soon realizes {{there is no place}} for him in the city ("East 12th Street"). Will, all <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> television, bemoans his outcast state ("Nobody Likes You"). As he finally gets up off the couch, Heather appears with her new show-off rockstar boyfriend ("Rock and Roll Girlfriend"). Will heads to the 7-Eleven to get away from them and, surprisingly, finds Johnny there. Johnny had sold his guitar for a bus ticket home. Tunny returns from the war zone (as an amputee) with the Extraordinary Girl. As Tunny introduces his friends to the Extraordinary Girl, Johnny becomes furious with him for leaving the group, but quickly forgives him and the three friends embrace. Heather and her boyfriend arrive. In an uneasy truce, she gives the baby to Will. Other friends show up to greet the three men they haven't seen in a year ("We're Coming Home Again"). One year later, Johnny laments that he lost the love of his life, but he accepts that he can live inside the struggle between rage and love that has defined his life. With this acceptance comes the possibility of hope ("Whatsername").|$|E

These included Britches, a five-week-old macaque, who had been separated from his mother at birth and left <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> eyes sewn shut and a sonar device on his head {{as part of a}} study into blindness. The raid, which was taped by the ALF, eight of the laboratory's seventeen active research projects were shut down, and the university said years of medical research were lost. The raid prompted National Institutes of Health director James Wyngaarden to argue that the raids should be regarded as acts of terrorism.|$|E

25|$|Set in {{a fictional}} {{version of the}} {{industrial}} age, the story begins with William Blackmore, a professional chimney sweep, leaving his family {{to take a job}} under a powerful industrialist, the Baron. A few months later, with William having failed to return and the family deep in debt, the four Blackmore children (Albert, Agatha, Abigail, and Archibald) are forced into apprenticeships by the Baron's agents, leaving the youngest, Charlie, <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> mother Agnes. A few weeks later, a pigeon arrives with a letter from Albert, who reveals that the Baron has split up him and his siblings, forcing them to work as slaves.

25|$|Phil Jaques and Anthony McGrath lifted Yorkshire with a third-wicket {{partnership}} of 310, 13 off the county record set in 1928, and although Jaques only added two to his overnight score of 217 {{before he was}} out caught, Yorkshire still amassed 570 thanks mainly to Ian Harvey and Craig White. Derbyshire spinners Ant Botha and Andy Gray got cheap wickets towards the end, as White was left stranded on 67 not out with the lower-order making insignificant contributions. However, Chris Silverwood and Richard Dawson chipped away at the Derbyshire batting line-up, taking two wickets each as Michael Di Venuto was fairly <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> 79 and Derbyshire {{made their way to}} 247 for 7 at stumps on day 2. That {{turned out to be the}} score at the end of day 3 as well, rain preventing any play as the match moved closer to a draw. Derbyshire's late-order battled for another thirty overs before they were bundled out for 350, and despite Deon Kruis snaring two early wickets in the follow on, Derbyshire survived 60 overs to make 173 for 5 at the end of day four and save the draw.|$|E
