2500|$|Abruzzo {{is known}} as [...] "the greenest region in Europe" [...] as one third of its territory, the largest in Europe, is set aside as {{national}} parks and protected nature reserves: there are three national parks, one regional park, and 38 protected nature reserves. These ensure the survival of 75% of Europe's living species including rare species, such as the small wading dotterel, golden eagle, the <b>Abruzzo</b> (or Abruzzese) <b>chamois,</b> Apennine wolf, and Marsican brown bear.

50|$|Campo Imperatore is {{also the}} habitat for the Apennine wolf, Apennine wildcat and the <b>Abruzzo</b> <b>chamois.</b> Nearly extinct, the latter is making a {{comeback}} through a joint effort by WWF Italia and {{the administration of the}} Gran Sasso National Park. Other species of wildlife include wild boar, foxes, grass snakes, and a wide variety of bird life including golden eagles and peregrine falcons.|$|E
50|$|The oldest in the Apennines, and the Italy's second {{declared}} park, with {{an important}} role in the preservation of species such as the Italian wolf, <b>Abruzzo</b> <b>chamois</b> and Marsican brown bear, the protected area is around two thirds beech forest though many other trees grow in the area including the silver birch and black and mountain pines. Other characteristic fauna of the park are roe deer, wild boar and the white-backed woodpecker.|$|E
50|$|The park {{contains}} one of {{the most}} biologically diverse areas of Europe. The climate is between that of the Mediterranean and that of the rest of continental Europe. The park contains more than two thousand plant species, some of which are found exclusively in this area, such as the Abruzzo Edelweiss. Many species of wildlife inhabit the park, including rare animals such as the <b>Abruzzo</b> <b>chamois,</b> as well as wolves, Marsican brown bear, roe deer, wildcats, wild boars, foxes and squirrels. Notable birds include the golden eagle, the white-backed woodpecker, the goshawk, the common buzzard and the peregrine falcon. There are also a wide variety of insects, such as the apollo butterfly.|$|E
5000|$|In 1913, when Sipari {{was first}} elected in the Italian Parliament, he took the {{opportunity}} {{to draw attention to the}} real threat of extinction of important species, such as the <b>Abruzzo</b> <b>chamois</b> and the Marsican brown bear, and proposed the creation of a national park in the area of Marsica. In 1921 he was appointed as Undersecretary of State to the Italian Navy. In the same year, he founded the [...] "Ente Autonomo of the Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo", who leased 5 square kilometres of land to be protected in the district of Opi. In September 1922 Sipari opened the Park in Pescasseroli. After, the park was recognized by Italian law (January 1923).|$|E
50|$|The Apennines {{stretch from}} modern day Liguria to Reggio Calabria, and {{mountain}} towns and communities {{can be found}} throughout {{the whole of the}} Apennine mountain range. However, certain regions, especially Abruzzo, Molise, eastern Lazio, Umbria, and Marche, are home to larger, more prototypical mountain cultures, and these cultures often remained largely isolated from the wider Italian peninsular culture until modern times. The region of Abruzzo in particular is well known for its mountain shepherd culture, with Teramo, Chieti, and L'Aquila being the most mountainous of Abruzzo's provinces. Abruzzo holds many of Italy's best-preserved and most beautiful medieval and Renaissance hill towns. The region is also the location of Gran Sasso and Abruzzo National Park, a haven for mountain-dwelling fauna such as the <b>Abruzzo</b> <b>chamois,</b> Italian wolf, and the Apennine brown bear.|$|E
50|$|The mid- {{to lower}} {{slopes of the}} Gran Sasso are grazed in spring, summer and autumn by large flocks of sheep guarded by Maremmano-Abruzzese sheepdogs as well as herds of cattle and semi-wild horses. The {{pastures}} are covered with field grasses and meadowland wildflowers. The park is also the habitat for diverse wildlife from rare species such as the Apennine wolf, the Marsican bear, wildcat and the <b>Abruzzo</b> <b>chamois</b> (Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata), a variety of chamois at {{the very edge of}} extinction but now making a comeback in the park through a joint effort by WWF Italia and the park administration. Other species of wildlife include wild boar, foxes, grass snakes such as Orsini's viper, and a wide variety of bird life including golden eagles, peregrine falcons, goshawks, ortolan buntings, rock sparrows, crested larks, red-backed shrikes and downy pipits.|$|E

Gastro-intestinal and lung strongiles, whipworms and tapeworms were also observed.

40|$|Abstract As {{part of the}} Abruzzo National Park {{wildlife}} {{health management}} program, serum samples from 62 free-living and captive <b>Abruzzo</b> <b>chamois,</b> Rupicapra (pyrenaica) ornata, were tested to estimate antibody presence to some pathogenous agents. The serum, drawn during chemical immobilisations for introductions or population study programs, were tested for: bovine herpes virus 1 (BHV- 1), parainfluenza virus (PI 3), pesti virus, {{foot and mouth disease}} virus (FMD) type O-A-C, bovine leukemia virus (BLV), ovicaprini lentivirus, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), S-phase brucellae, leptospira interrogans, mycobacterium paratuberculosis, chlamydia psittaci, coxiella burnetii, rickettsia mooseri and conori and toxoplasrna gondii. Twenty-three subjects were found positive to BHV- 1 (7 / 62), pestivirus (6 / 62), EMCV (8 / 62), leptospira (5 / 62) and toxoplasma (4 / 62). Results did not indicate any active infection but only contact with some pathogenic agents...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT- We {{have studied}} genetic {{divergence}} and phylogenetic relationships of Alpine, Spanish and <b>Abruzzo</b> <b>chamois</b> (genus Rupicapra) by sequencing {{a region of}} 330 nucleotides within the mito-chondrial DNA cytochrome b gene (mtDNA cyt 6). These sequences were aligned with additional ho-mologous sequences of Caprinae: Japanese serow, Chinese goral, Canadian mountain goat, Mishmi takin, muskox, Sardinian mouflon and domestic goat. Results suggest that, using representatives of the Bovini as outgroups, the Caprinae constitute a monophyletic clade. However, inferred phyloge-netic relationships among and within tribes of Caprinae were poorly defined and did not reflect cur-rent evolutionary and taxonomical views. In fact, the Asian Rupicaprini goral and serow constituted a strongly supported clade, which included the muskox, while the takin grouped with Uvis. Therefore, the monophyly of Ovibovini was not supported by cyt b sequences. Species of Rupicapra joined a strongly supported monophyletic clade, which was distantly related to the Asian rupicaprins and Ore-amnos. Therefore, the monophyly of the Rupicaprini was not supported by these cyt h sequences. There were sister species relationships within Rupicapra, Spanish and Alpine chamois and the Abruz-zo chamois (Rupicupru pyrenaica ornata) was strictly related to the Spanish chamois (Rupicapra pyre-naica parva), as previously suggested by allozyme data and hiogeographic reconstructions...|$|E
