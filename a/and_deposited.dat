40|$|We set a task of {{constructing}} a conceptual flow model of bank pricing under {{the condition of}} random lag on loans <b>and</b> <b>deposits</b> returning in this paper. By pricing we are mean the optimal loan rate <b>and</b> <b>deposit</b> rate selecting, {{which will be the}} basis for pricing on other loan <b>and</b> <b>deposit</b> bank products. From the controlling theory point of view, bank was presented as an object, that can be controlled by pricing and which is affected by random lags in loans returning. Pricing influences money flows from bank?s loan <b>and</b> <b>deposit</b> activity via function of demand on loans and function of supply of <b>deposits,</b> <b>and</b> these flows influence bank profit and capital. Volumes of loan <b>and</b> <b>deposit</b> activities depend on bank capital, therefore there is a dynamics in the model. By synthesizing these approaches, the conceptual pricing model under the conditions of random lag in loans <b>and</b> <b>deposits</b> returning was proposed for the first time. ? ?????? ?????????? ?????? ?????????? ?????????????? ????????? ?????? ??????????????? ????? ??? ??????? ??????? ?????????? ???????????? ??? ???????? ???????? ? ?????????. ??? ???????????????? ??????????????? ??????????? ??????????? ????????? ? ?????????? ??????, ??????? ????? ???????? ??? ??????????? ??? ?? ?????? ????????? ? ?????????? ???????? ?????. ? ????? ?????? ?????? ??????????, ???? ???? ??????????? ??? ??????, ??????? ????? ????????? ????? ??????????????? ? ?? ??????? ?????? ?????????? ? ???? ????????? ???????????? ??? ???????? ????????. ??????????????? ????? ??????? ?????? ?? ??????? ? ??????? ??????????? ????????? ?????? ?? ???????? ?????? ????????? ? ?????????? ???????????? ?????, ? ???, ? ???? ???????, ?? ??????? ? ??????? ?????. ?????? ????????-?????????? ???????? ??????? ?? ???????? ?????, ??????? ? ?????? ???????????? ????????. ? ??????? ??????? ???? ???????? ??????? ???? ?????????? ?????????????? ?????? ??????????????? ????? ??? ??????? ??????? ?????????? ???????????? ??? ???????? ???????? ? ?????????...|$|R

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  5, {{at the end}} of June 2017, the largest {{fraction}} of loans <b>and</b> <b>deposits</b> granted by Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem were loans to Households, followed by bank-to-bank loans <b>and</b> <b>deposits</b> <b>and</b> loans to Non-Financial Corporations, amounting to around 5.49, 4.48, and 4.32 trillion euros, respectively. More specifically, from the macro-network analysis of the financial exposures via loans <b>and</b> <b>deposits,</b> we can notice that, despite the fact that a large fraction of loans <b>and</b> <b>deposits</b> granted by Monetary and Financial Institutions is intra-financial (7.53 trillion euros), the most relevant portion is granted by the private banking sector to the real sector (9.81 trillion euros), followed by loans <b>and</b> <b>deposits</b> to the Rest of the World and public sector (amounting to 2.65 and 1.05 trillion euros, respectively). Unfortunately, available data on the institutional sector Rest of the World do not allow us to discriminate between real sector and financial sector of non-euro area countries receiving the aforementioned amount of loans <b>and</b> <b>deposits</b> by the euro area private banking system. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that, the disaggregation of Monetary Financial Institutions in Eurosystem and Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem, not only {{from the point of view}} of the sector granting the loans <b>and</b> <b>deposits,</b> such as in Perillo and Battiston (2017), but also from the perspective of the institutional sector receiving them, allows us to discriminate among bank-to-bank loans <b>and</b> <b>deposits</b> (4.48 trillion euros), loans <b>and</b> <b>deposits</b> granted by the private banking system to the Eurosystem (1.72 trillion euros), <b>and</b> loans <b>and</b> <b>deposits</b> granted <b>and</b> received within the Eurosystem (2.27 trillion euros). The latter category belongs to the so-called TARGET balances, i.e., intra-Eurosystem assets and liabilities of central banks’ balance sheet resulting from net cross-border payments in the form of central bank reserves, via the Eurosystem real-time payment system, which settles continuously euro-denominated payments on an individual transaction-by-transaction basis without netting (called TARGET 2)(Eisenschmidt et al. 2017).|$|R

5|$|Continued ingress {{of water}} from the roof and from unroofed {{exterior}} walkways above the ceiling level had caused seepage which carried down salts from the building mortar <b>and</b> <b>deposited</b> them on the ceiling through evaporation. In places this caused the surface of the frescoes to bubble and lift. Although discolouration was a serious problem, bubbling was not, because the thinness and transparency of the paint which Michelangelo employed on the greater part of the ceiling permitted the salts to pass through rather than accumulating beneath the surface.|$|E
5|$|Four {{hundred million}} years ago, California lay {{at the bottom of}} a large sea; {{underwater}} volcanoes deposited lava and minerals (including gold) onto the sea floor. By tectonic forces these minerals and rocks came to the surface of the Sierra Nevada, and eroded.

Another team in 2008 determined the structure of linezolid bound to a 50S subunit of Deinococcus radiodurans. The authors proposed a refined model for the mechanism of action of oxazolidinones, finding that linezolid occupies the A site of the 50S ribosomal subunit, inducing a conformational change that prevents tRNA from entering the site and ultimately forcing tRNA to separate from the ribosome.|$|E

5|$|Many {{substances}} {{enter the}} sea {{as a result}} of human activities. Combustion products are transported in the air <b>and</b> <b>deposited</b> through precipitation. Agricultural, industrial, and sewage outflows contribute heavy metals, pesticides, PCBs, disinfectants, cleaning products, and other synthetic chemicals. These become concentrated in the surface film and in marine sediment, especially estuarine mud. The result of all this contamination is largely unknown because of the large number of substances involved and the lack of information on their biological effects. The heavy metals of greatest concern are copper, lead, mercury, cadmium, and zinc which may be accumulated by marine invertebrates. They are then passed up the food chain.|$|E

On March 31, 302, in a rescript from Alexandria, Diocletian, after consultation with the proconsul for Egypt, ordered that the leading Manicheans be burnt alive along with their scriptures. This was the first time an Imperial persecution ever called for the destruction of sacred literature. Low-status Manicheans were to be executed; high-status Manicheans were to be sent to work in the quarries of Proconnesus (Marmara Island) or the mines of Phaeno.

40|$|Pricing {{in banking}} is actual and {{sophisticated}} problem. It {{is hard to}} find a solution to this problem, because of existence of great number of credit <b>and</b> <b>deposit</b> bank?s products with differentmaturity and terms. One of approaches to solve this problem is to use mathematical models of bank. We consider using flow model of bank that was developed by authors. On basis of bank flow model, multiproduct bank model in matrix form was presented. Problem of control by credit rates <b>and</b> <b>deposit</b> rates with goal to maximize bank?s equity capital on the end of controlling period was presented and solved. Optimal loan rates <b>and</b> <b>deposit</b> rates for custom number of bank products were achieved under the situation, when demand of one product doesn?t depend on rate of other one. According to found optimal credit rates <b>and</b> <b>deposit</b> rates, optimal volumes of output credits <b>and</b> accumulated <b>deposits</b> with different maturities were received.

5|$|Antioch was Diocletian's primary {{residence}} from 299 to 302, while Galerius swapped {{places with}} his Augustus on the Middle and Lower Danube. Diocletian visited Egypt once, {{over the winter}} of 301–2, and issued a grain dole in Alexandria. Following some public disputes with Manicheans, Diocletian ordered that the leading followers of Mani be burnt alive along with their scriptures. In a 31 March 302 rescript from Alexandria, he declared that low-status Manicheans must be executed by the blade, and high-status Manicheans must be sent {{to work in the}} quarries of Proconnesus (Marmara Island, Turkey) or the mines of Phaeno in southern Palestine. All Manichean property was to be seized <b>and</b> <b>deposited</b> in the imperial treasury. Diocletian found much to be offended by in Manichean religion: its novelty, its alien origins, the way it corrupted the morals of the Roman race, and its inherent opposition to long-standing religious traditions. Manichaeanism was also supported by Persia at the time, compounding religious dissent with international politics. Excepting Persian support, the reasons he disliked Manichaenism were equally applicable, if not more so, to Christianity, his next target.|$|E
5|$|As {{recently}} as the Cretaceous period 100million years ago, much of western North America was still part of the Pacific Ocean. Tectonic forces from the collision of the Farallon Plate with the North American Plate pushed up the Rocky Mountains between 75 and 50million {{years ago in a}} mountain-building episode known as the Laramide orogeny. The Colorado first formed as a west-flowing stream draining the southwestern portion of the range, and the uplift also diverted the Green River from its original course to the Mississippi River west towards the Colorado. About 30 to 20million years ago, volcanic activity related to the orogeny led to the Mid-Tertiary ignimbrite flare-up, which created smaller formations such as the Chiricahua Mountains in Arizona <b>and</b> <b>deposited</b> massive amounts of volcanic ash and debris over the watershed. The Colorado Plateau first began to rise during the Eocene, between about 55 and 34million years ago, but did not attain its present height until about 5million years ago, about when the Colorado River established its present course into the Gulf of California.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, in 1980, {{geologist}} Walter Alvarez and his father, Nobel Prize-winning scientist Luis Walter Alvarez, put forth his hypothesis {{that a large}} extraterrestrial body had struck Earth. In 1981, unaware of Penfield's discovery, University of Arizona graduate student Alan R. Hildebrand and faculty adviser William V. Boynton published a draft Earth-impact theory and sought a candidate crater. Their evidence included greenish-brown clay with surplus iridium containing shocked quartz grains and small weathered glass beads that looked to be tektites. Thick, jumbled deposits of coarse rock fragments were also present, {{thought to have been}} scoured from one place <b>and</b> <b>deposited</b> elsewhere by a megatsunami resulting from an Earth impact. Such deposits occur in many locations but seem concentrated in the Caribbean basin at the K–Pg boundary. So when Haitian professor Florentine Morás discovered what he thought to be evidence of an ancient volcano on Haiti, Hildebrand suggested it could be a telltale feature of a nearby impact. Tests on samples retrieved from the K–Pg boundary revealed more tektite glass, formed only in the heat of asteroid impacts and high-yield nuclear detonations.|$|E
