50|$|A judge-advisor system (JAS) {{is a type}} {{of advice}} {{structure}} often studied in <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> research, a subset of decision-making in the social sciences. The two roles in a JAS are the judge and advisor roles. The judge is the decision maker who evaluates information concerning a particular decision and makes the final judgment on the decision outcome. The advisor is an individual who provides advice, information, or suggestions to the judge. A key component of the dynamics in a JAS is the differentiation between the two roles in that while the advisor provides input to the decision, actual decision-making power resides solely with the judge. This one person decision power differentiates the JAS and related models such as Hollenbeck's Hierarchical Decision-Making Team model from more widely studied models where the final decision is mutually decided upon by the team as a whole.|$|E

This is largely a result of Citizens <b>Advice</b> <b>taking</b> over roles that were previously performed by the quangos the Office of Fair Trading and Consumer Futures. [...] During 2012 and 2013 Citizens Advice adopted an Equality Strategy known as 'Stand Up For Equality' which aims to embed an equality agenda in all work Citizens Advice does. In 2014 Citizens Advice took over the role that Victim Support played in supporting court witnesses. This contract is worth £24m. This service was renamed the Witness Service. Also in 2014 Citizens Advice took {{over the role of}} Consumer Focus which represents consumers of regulated industries (energy and the postal service). This service was renamed Consumer Futures. In 2015 Citizens Advice began to deliver Pension Wise guidance. In 2015 Citizens Advice adopted a rebrand dropping the 'Bureau' from its name. The rebrand will cost £1 million which includes £215,000 for research and development, £450,000 in financial support to implement the changes and £300,000 to cover local costs such as posters and materials. The rebrand was criticised by Steve Johnson the Chief Executive Officer of Advice UK who described it as [...] "facile". However, evidence from Citizens Advice focus groups found that while the charity was well known the brand was considered somewhat “tired” or “old fashioned”.|$|E
40|$|<b>Advice</b> <b>taking</b> {{constitutes}} {{a strategy to}} increase judgment accuracy that builds on existing ecological structures. Specifically, averaging the own judgment with that of others yields an increase in expected accuracy. Moreover, many decision situations are inherently interactive, thereby offering the opportunity to acquire advice before producing a final judgment. Theoretically, <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> is thus highly adaptive. However, research on <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> hinges on three core problems: the uncertain adaptivity of <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> behavior; {{the lack of a}} unifying theoretical framework; and the conceptual constraints of existing research. First, whereas averaging the own judgment and the advice yields highest expected accuracy, individuals often place a relatively low weight on the advice during judgment revision. Second, there is no theoretical framework to integrate the many determinants of <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> already identified. Third, <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> research almost exclusively focused on the weighting of advice once it is received, thereby neglecting information search. The current thesis addresses these three problems from an ecological perspective. This perspective assumes that the interactive nature of <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> affords the individual with the opportunity to seek additional information. Specifically, <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> is conceptualized as a sequential process that can be truncated at different points in time, for example after consulting different amounts of advice. To this end, the current thesis introduces an expanded <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> paradigm that allows individuals to sample any number of other people’s judgments before revising their own. The current thesis proposes an information integration account of <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> that expands existing theoretical ideas, incorporates information search and integrates the most important determinants of <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> as identified by existing research. The adaptivity of <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> is re-evaluated from this ecological perspective. A simulation assesses which integration strategy fares best in an environment that accords to the ecological perspective advocated in this thesis. Experiments investigate whether individuals explore and adapt to the information ecology when given the opportunity. The results suggest that <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> is much more adaptive than previously documented. Placing a low weight on the advice yields higher accuracy than weighting the own judgment and the advice equally when <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> is a sequential process with several steps of updating. Moreover, individuals explore and adapt to the information ecology when given the opportunity. The experimental data also support the proposed theoretical framework of <b>advice</b> <b>taking.</b> This thesis provides strong evidence that the ecological nature of <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> can no longer be neglected by <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> research. Further discrepancies between <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> in the laboratory and <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> in the wild, necessary steps to further validate the proposed theoretical account, and future directions to investigating the adaptivity of <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> are discussed.

40|$|Recently, <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> has {{received}} attention in decision-making research, and {{some studies suggest}} that emotions {{may play a role}} in this process. Yet a clear account of how emotions influence <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> is lacking. The current research introduces a parsimonious explanation by suggesting that such effects can be predicted on the basis of two emotion dimensions: valence (positivity or negativity) and agency (self-focused versus other-focused). In five experiments with different emotion inductions and different measures for <b>advice</b> <b>taking,</b> the effects of positive emotions such as gratitude and pride and of negative emotions such as anger and shame on <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> were studied. The findings reveal that emotion valence and agency exert an influence on <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> and that this interaction effect is mediated by the perceived ability of the advisor. Together, these findings provide a unique theoretical and empirical contribution to our understanding of emotions in <b>advice</b> <b>taking...</b>|$|E
40|$|Across 8 experiments, the {{influence}} of anxiety on advice seeking and <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> is described.

The relationships between anxiety and advice seeking and anxiety and <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> are mediated by self-confidence; anxiety lowers self-confidence, which increases advice seeking and reliance upon advice (Experiment 3). Although anxiety also impairs information processing, impaired information processing does not mediate the relationship between anxiety and <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> (Experiment 4). Finally, anxious individuals are found to fail to discriminate between good and bad advice (Experiments 5 a– 5 c), and between advice from advisors with and without a conflict of interest (Experiment 6) ...|$|E
40|$|Using {{advice in}} {{decision}} making is widespread {{for all sorts of}} important personal and professional decisions. Yet, traditional research on individual decision making has failed to systematically study the impact that social interactions about a decision problem can have on the decision outcome. A separate literature stream about advice giving and taking emerged in the 1980 s in order to model a decision making structure where one person is responsible for the final decision, but seeks advice from one or more other persons as input in the decision making process. To date, a breadth of research questions have been addressed in order to gradually develop a theory of <b>advice</b> <b>taking.</b> This dissertation is a bundle of three empirical papers on <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> in marketing that each studies a specific topic within the <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> domain. Using similar experimental methodologies, the papers bundled in this thesis all find and discuss variable utilization of advice based on the manipulation of one element in the advice situation: advisor wealth, advice justification, and emotions experienced by the decision maker. As such, each of the papers offers some interesting managerial implications and contributes {{to the development of a}} more comprehensive theory of <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> in its own right...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two largely stand-alone chapters. The first chapter presents a goal-activation theory of the antecedents of <b>advice</b> <b>taking.</b> I propose that three separate categories of goals - decision quality, social standing, and emotional well-being - influence receptivity to advice. Decision quality goals increase striving toward a good outcome in the decision for which the advice was given. Social standing goals {{focus attention on the}} social effects of the act of taking or rejecting the advice. Emotional well-being goals are related to establishing or maintaining a desired affective state. Each of these goals can be activated by attributes of the situation, advice, advisee, and advisor. Because they increase striving toward different ends, the goals direct attention to disparate advice-related cues and affect the evaluation of those cues. This results in different responses to advice. At the current time, nearly all research on <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> has addressed decision quality goals and related cues. By presenting this theory, I hope to increase interest in a wider set of antecedents of <b>advice</b> <b>taking.</b> The second chapter reports a series of studies testing hypotheses derived from the theory presented in the first chapter. Specifically, I contrast the effects of an advisor's relative expertise to effects of the advisor's relative hierarchical position on <b>advice</b> <b>taking.</b> I hypothesize that the effects of expertise are driven by decision quality goals, while the effects of relative hierarchical position relate to social standing goals. I further hypothesize that advisees' conceptions of appropriate leader-follower relations (specifically, follower co-production role orientation; Carsten & Uhl-Bien, 2012) activate social standing goals, but not decision quality goals. Lastly, I propose that outcome accountability increases attention to decision quality goals and reduces attention to social standing goals...|$|E

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIAdvice taking {{is central}} to making better decisions, but some {{individuals}} seem unwilling to use advice. The present research {{examined the relationship between}} narcissism and <b>advice</b> <b>taking.</b> In particular, we studied the mechanisms that explain why narcissists are dismissive of advice. In three studies, we found that narcissism and <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> were negatively related, but only when measuring narcissism at the state level or when controlling for extraversion at the trait level. We also tested two mechanisms and found that confidence did not mediate the relationship; disregard for others did. In Study 4, participants were placed under different accountability pressures to affect self-enhancement. Results showed that the narcissism-advice taking relationship was strongly negative under process accountability. Taken together, these results suggest that narcissists eschew advice not because of greater confidence, but because they think others are incompetent and because they fail to reduce their self-enhancement when expecting to be assessed.

40|$|The present {{research}} addresses <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> from a holistic perspective covering both advice seeking and weighting. We build on previous theorizing that assumes that underweighting of advice results from biased samples of information. That is, decision makers have more knowledge supporting their own judgment {{than that of}} another person and thus weight the former stronger than the latter. In the present approach, we assume that participants reduce this informational asymmetry by the sampling of advice and that sampling frequency depends on the information ecology. Advice that is distant from the decision maker's initial estimate should lead to a higher frequency of advice sampling than close advice. Moreover, we assume that advice distant from the decision maker's initial estimate and advice that is supported by larger samples of advisory estimates are weighted more strongly in the final judgment. We expand the classical research paradigm with a sampling phase that allows participants to sample any number of advisory estimates before revising their judgments. Three experiments strongly support these hypotheses, thereby advancing our understanding of <b>advice</b> <b>taking</b> as an adaptive process...|$|E
