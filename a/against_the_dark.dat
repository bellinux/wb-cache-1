5|$|Later on, Lupin's Defence <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> Arts {{sessions}} prove {{far better}} than those of Gilderoy Lockhart's (Harry's uselessly vain ex-teacher). They have a fun lesson on Boggarts (see Magical Creatures in Harry Potter) and then learn about more Dark Creatures. When Lupin supposedly falls ill, the much hated Potions Master Professor Snape temporarily takes over teaching Defence <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> Arts and torments the class, much to their dismay.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 15 mm. The forewings are white, thickly suffused with fuscous, obliterating the white ground-color {{except on the}} apical third of the wing, which is pure white. Near base is an ill-defined oblique costal streak {{with only a few}} dark scales therefore appearing whitish <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>darker</b> surrounding parts. <b>The</b> hindwings are light fuscous.|$|R

5|$|Ian Hart as Quirinus Quirrell, the {{slightly}} nervous Defence <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> Arts teacher at Hogwarts, and also Lord Voldemort's voice. David Thewlis auditioned for the part; {{he would later}} be cast as Remus Lupin in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.|$|E
5|$|Professor Quirrell is a twitching, {{stammering}} man {{who teaches}} Defence <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> Arts. Reputedly {{he was a}} brilliant scholar, but his nerve was shattered by an encounter with vampires. Quirrell wears a turban to conceal {{the fact that he}} is voluntarily possessed by Voldemort, whose face appears on the back of Quirrell's head.|$|E
5|$|Professor Severus Snape, {{who has a}} hooked nose, sallow {{complexion}} and greasy black hair, teaches Potions, {{but would}} prefer to teach Defence <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> Arts. Snape praises pupils in Slytherin, his own House but seizes every opportunity to humiliate others, especially Harry. Several incidents, beginning with the shooting pain in Harry's scar during the start-of-term feast, lead Harry and his friends to think Snape is a follower of Voldemort.|$|E
50|$|Lehmannia marginata is {{species of}} {{air-breathing}} land slug, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk {{in the family}} Limacidae. Sometimes classified in the genus Limax, the species is distinct in its ecology, and its nearly transparent body. It is a medium-sized species, rarely exceeding 12 cm in body length. The body is fairly long and narrow, with a marked keel. The keel looks lighter than <b>the</b> remaining body <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>darker</b> innards.|$|R

40|$|The {{perceptions}} of food shoppers, produce managers in supermarkets, and wholesale produce buyers were examined {{with respect to}} acceptance of a fresh green bean that is slightly darker in color than the current leading cultivar.

5|$|The third novel, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, follows Harry in {{his third}} year of magical education. It is the only book in the series which does not feature Lord Voldemort in any form. Instead, Harry must deal with the {{knowledge}} that he has been targeted by Sirius Black, his father's best friend, and, according to the Wizarding World, an escaped mass murderer who assisted in the murder of Harry's parents. As Harry struggles with his reaction to the dementors – dark creatures with the power to devour a human soul and feed on despair – which are ostensibly protecting the school, he reaches out to Remus Lupin, a Defence <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> Arts teacher who is eventually revealed to be a werewolf. Lupin teaches Harry defensive measures which are well above the level of magic generally executed by people his age. Harry comes to know that both Lupin and Black were best friends of his father and that Black was framed by their fourth friend, Peter Pettigrew, who had been hiding as Ron's pet rat, Scabbers. In this book, a recurring theme throughout the series is emphasised – in every book there is a new Defence <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> Arts teacher, none of whom lasts more than one school year.|$|E
5|$|To {{enter the}} ride, guests {{walk through the}} gates of Hogwarts and begin their journey in the dungeons where they see items {{featured}} in the movies and books. Passengers enter through the castle doors, go to the lockers, queue outside in the green house and then enter the back castle doors. Objects recognizable from the series include the Mirror of Erised, the Hogwarts House Jewels, and talking portraits. As guests proceed throughout the hallways, they encounter replicas of the rooms of Hogwarts castle, including the Headmaster's office, the Defence <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> Arts classroom and the Gryffindor common room. In the Headmaster's office, Professor Dumbledore extends a warm welcome to all Muggles, informing them that Professor Binns is hosting a lecture {{on the history of}} the school. In the Defence <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> Arts classroom, Harry, Ron, and Hermione appear from under the Invisibility Cloak, urging guests to meet them in the Room of Requirement in order to sneak everyone down to a Quidditch match. Ron tries to cast a spell, which goes wrong, and one of several special effects, such as falling snow, is triggered. Before continuing on, visitors receive a safety reminder from the Sorting Hat and several paintings in the next two rooms.|$|E
5|$|The {{night before}} he is {{expected}} to leave for Hogwarts, Harry learns from Arthur Weasley that Sirius Black is a convicted murderer in the wizarding world, and he warns Harry that it is believed Black will attempt to murder Harry next. On the way to Hogwarts a Dementor boards the train, causing Harry to faint. Following the incident, Harry is helped by the new Defence <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> Arts teacher Remus Lupin. Harry, Ron, and Hermione learn that the Dementors will be patrolling the school in an attempt to catch Black.|$|E

60|$|He hastened {{past the}} lads {{and young women}} with clinking buckets who were drawing water from the fountains by the wayside, and took the {{direction}} of the church. With the disappearance of the sun the lighthouse had again set up its flame <b>against</b> <b>the</b> sky, <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> church rising in the foreground. Here he allowed her to overtake him.|$|R
5|$|Atlantic puffins lead solitary existences when {{out at sea}} {{and this}} part of their life has been little studied as the task of finding even one bird on the vast ocean is formidable. When at sea, the Atlantic puffin bobs about like a cork, {{propelling}} itself through the water with powerful thrusts of its feet and keeping itself turned into the wind, even when resting and apparently asleep. It spends much time each day preening to keep its plumage in order and spread oil from the preen gland. Its downy under-plumage remains dry and provides thermal insulation. In common with other seabirds, its upper surface is black and underside white. This provides camouflage, with aerial predators unable to observe the bird <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> watery background and underwater attackers failing to notice it as it blends in with the bright sky above the waves.|$|E
5|$|How the ostensibly weak-swimming {{frilled shark}} captures active, {{fast-moving}} squid {{is a matter}} of speculation. One possibility is that it takes advantage of injured squid, or those that are exhausted and dying after spawning. Alternatively, it may surprise its prey by curving its body and, bracing itself with its posteriorly positioned fins, launching a quick strike forward {{in the manner of a}} snake. It may also be able to close its gill slits and create negative pressure to suck prey into its mouth. The many small, sharp, recurved teeth of the frilled shark are functionally similar to squid jigs and could easily snag the body or tentacles of a squid, particularly as they are rotated outwards when the jaws are protruded. Observations of captive frilled sharks swimming with their mouths open suggest that the small teeth, light <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> mouth, may even fool squid into attacking and entangling themselves.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry must confront the newly resurfaced Voldemort. In {{response}} to Voldemort's reappearance, Dumbledore re-activates the Order of the Phoenix, a secret society which works from Sirius Black's dark family home to defeat Voldemort's minions and protect Voldemort's targets, especially Harry. Despite Harry's description of Voldemort's recent activities, the Ministry of Magic {{and many others}} in the magical world refuse to believe that Voldemort has returned. In an attempt to counter and eventually discredit Dumbledore, who along with Harry is the most prominent voice in the Wizarding World attempting to warn of Voldemort's return, the Ministry appoints Dolores Umbridge as the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts and the new Defence <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> Arts teacher. She transforms the school into a dictatorial regime and refuses to allow the students to learn ways to defend themselves against dark magic.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} Selectric had to {{be ordered}} to use either cloth reusable ribbon or one-time carbon film ribbon; the same machine could not use both. [...] This [...] was also true of the original, non-correcting Selectric II. [...] IBM had used a similar carbon film ribbon on their earlier Executive series of typewriters. As with these older machines, the carbon film ribbon presented a security issue in some environments: It was possible to read the text that had been typed from the ribbon, seen as light characters <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>darker</b> ribbon background.|$|R

5|$|In the meantime, Uncle Vernon punishes Harry, fitting locks to {{his bedroom}} door and bars to the windows. However, Ron Weasley arrives with his twin {{brothers}} Fred and George in their father Arthur’s enchanted Ford Anglia and they rescue Harry, who stays at their family home, the Burrow, {{for the remainder of}} his holidays. Harry and the other Weasleys—mother Molly, third eldest son Percy, and daughter Ginny (who has a crush on Harry)—travel to Diagon Alley. There, they are reunited with Hermione Granger and introduced to Lucius Malfoy, father of Harry’s school nemesis Draco, and Gilderoy Lockhart, a conceited autobiographer who has been appointed Defence <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> Arts professor after the death of Professor Quirrel. When Harry and Ron approach Platform 9 3/4 in King's Cross station it refuses to allow them pass; instead, they fly Arthur’s car to Hogwarts, where they crash into a sentient willow tree on the grounds.|$|E
5|$|Metro: Last Light {{takes place}} in 2034, {{one year after the}} events of Metro 2033, {{following}} the ending of the original novel in which Artyom's missile strike <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> Ones — mysterious beings that seemingly threatened the survivors of a nuclear war living in the Moscow Metro — occurred. The Rangers, a neutral peacekeeping force that operates throughout the system, have since occupied the D6 military facility Artyom visited during the first game. This is a huge, and not fully explored pre-war bunker, and Artyom, now a Ranger himself, remains unsure whether killing the Dark Ones was the correct decision. Rumors of D6's discovery, and its great riches, have spread around the Metro; rival factions, such as the Communist Red Line and Nazi Fourth Reich, hope to seize the bunker and its contents.|$|E
5|$|StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty {{introduces}} the fanatical Tal'Darim, {{who are at}} odds with Jim Raynor while he attempts to find Xel'Naga artifacts for the Moebius Foundation. More significantly, Zeratul discovers that some force has successfully combined Protoss and Zerg genetic material, creating a race of incredibly powerful hybrids. Zeratul travels to Aiur to probe the corpse of the Zerg Overmind for information on an apocalyptic prophecy, and unexpectedly finds Tassadar in an ethereal form. Memories found in the Overmind's cortex depict a vision of a future in which Kerrigan is killed, whereupon the hybrids (led by an entity known only as the Dark Voice) take control of the Swarm, destroy all other forms of life, then obliterate the Zerg as well. The Protoss are the last society left standing <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> Voice's armies. Zeratul finds Raynor, knowing his intent to track down and defeat the Queen of Blades, and tells him to spare her life.|$|E
50|$|Roberta and Tormund {{meet each}} other and then proceed to warn the king of Brightvale about the Faerie. It is {{revealed}} that both were given amulets to protect <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Darkest</b> Faerie's power, and upon research discover that <b>the</b> <b>Darkest</b> Faerie was once sealed away {{by the power of}} Fyora's magical rod, now lying deep underneath the city of Meridell. After freeing the neighboring regions from control of dark magic, they are able to infiltrate the castle of Meridell and find a way deep underground, recovering Fyora's ancient rod. With its power they are able to drive the darkness out of the city, and then return to Faerieland to stop <b>the</b> <b>Darkest</b> Faerie. It is a trap, however, as <b>the</b> <b>Darkest</b> Faerie seizes <b>the</b> rod and a fight between the two Faeries ensues. Fyora is able to teleport Tormund and Roberta to safety before being captured and imprisoned again.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a sort}} {{of grave}} fascination in the {{exceeding}} sternness of the scene-—the grey heaps of stone, the mountains raising their shining white summits <b>against</b> <b>the</b> blue, <b>the</b> <b>dark,</b> fathomless, lifeless lake, and the utter absence of all forms of life. Armine's spirit fell under the spell, and he moved dreamily on, hardly attending to Jock, who was running on with Chico, and alarming him by feints of catching him and throwing him into the water.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{he looked}} out with her towards the sea, and they watched the long, {{rippling}} waves break upon the brown sands, the faint and unexpected gleam of wintry sunshine lying upon the bosom of the sea, and the screaming seagulls, whose white wings shone like alabaster <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>darker</b> clouds. For him these things were no longer beautiful, nor did he see the sunlight, which with a sudden fitfulness had warmed the air. It was all very cold and grey. It was not {{possible for him to}} read the riddle yet--she had not said that she could not care for him. There was that hope! ...|$|R
