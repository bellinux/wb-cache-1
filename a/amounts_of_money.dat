5|$|ATV Music Publishing {{remained}} a successful {{organization in the}} music industry throughout the 1970s. Len Beadle, the company's chief executive, signed up many songwriters and bought numerous song catalogues. The catalog acquisitions, along with the continuing royalties from Lennon and McCartney, ensured that large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> were frequently coming in for ATV Music Publishing. Despite the success of the music publishing organization, other ventures formed by Grade were not performing as well. Pye Records, which continued to distribute music from artists such as Carl Douglas and Barry White, was failing to bring in large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> The main television arm of ATV lost its government-granted license in its then-current form and was restructured into Central Independent Television.|$|E
5|$|According to Hepburn (2006, pp.238–239), “it {{should be}} {{expected}} that industry will lobby furiously against any auctioning.” Hepburn et al. (2006) state {{that it is an}} empirical fact that while businesses tend to oppose auctioning of emissions permits, economists almost uniformly recommend auctioning permits. Garnaut notes that the complexity of free allocation, and the large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> involved, encourage non-productive rent-seeking behaviour and lobbying of governments, activities that dissipate economic value.|$|E
5|$|Bingo America is an American {{game show}} {{broadcast}} by Game Show Network. The series follows two contestants {{as they try}} to compete to win up to $100,000. Additionally, the series lets at-home viewers print bingo cards online that allow them to play along with the show to win small <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> for themselves.|$|E
25|$|Some {{zero coupon}} bonds are {{inflation}} indexed, so the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> {{that will be}} paid to the bond holder is calculated to have a set <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> purchasing power rather than a set <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> but the majority of zero coupon bonds pay a set <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> known as the face value of the bond.|$|R

5|$|Gates {{is one of}} {{the best-known}} {{entrepreneurs}} of the personal computer revolution. He has been criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings. Later in his career, Gates pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors. He donated large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was established in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, the French society {{restricted}} registration to horses {{with both}} parents already {{registered with the}} society. In the early 20th century, the Percheron {{was one of the}} four major draft horse breeds, along with the Belgian, the Clydesdale and the Shire. Breeders could sell their horses for significant <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> especially in the United States and Canada, where breeding stock brought a premium price.|$|E
5|$|To a large extent, {{the public}} {{were aware of}} the vast {{financial}} resources that Augustus commanded. He failed to encourage enough senators to finance the building and maintenance of networks of roads in Italy in 20 BC, but he undertook direct responsibility for them. This was publicized on the Roman currency issued in 16 BC, after he donated vast <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> to the aerarium Saturni, the public treasury.|$|E

50|$|Minton {{offered a}} reward of $360,000 {{to anyone who}} would leave Scientology with enough {{information}} to cause the organization to lose its federal tax exemption.

50|$|Once all spins {{had been}} played, {{a second round}} of trivia {{questions}} followed with the same rules as before. A second Big Board round followed, with much higher stakes in play. This time, contestants played in order from least <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> to highest <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> unless there was a tie between two or more contestants, in which case the contestant with the least <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> spins started the round. Any passed spins, as before, went to the opponent with the higher <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b>|$|R
5|$|Ambrose Channel is {{the main}} {{shipping}} channel {{in and out of}} the Port of New York and New Jersey, making it the only means of accessing an important commercial port. Delays posed a major problem for shipping en route to New York City, and bad weather could close the Channel for days. Ships were forced to wait at the Harbor's entrance for conditions to clear. These delays cost shipping companies substantial <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> with each ship costing between $500 and $4000 per hour it was stopped (roughly $5,700 to $46,000 in 2013 dollars).|$|E
5|$|Before long, Nerva's {{expenses}} strained {{the economy}} of Rome and, although perhaps not ruinous to the extent once suggested by Syme, necessitated {{the formation of a}} special commission of economy to drastically reduce expenditures. The most superfluous religious sacrifices, games and horse races were abolished, while new income was generated from Domitian's former possessions, including the auctioning of ships, estates, and even furniture. Large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> were obtained from Domitian's silver and gold statues, and Nerva forbade that similar images be made in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad Darwis (Ihsan Tarore) is a {{youth in}} 19th-century Kauman, Yogyakarta, {{and the son}} of Kyai Abubakar, the imam of the area's mosque. Displeased with the mixture of Islam and animistic Javanese mysticism, which leads to poor Javanese {{spending}} exorbitant <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> on religious ceremonies, Darwis decides to go on the hajj to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. While there, he studies what he considers the true form of Islam over a period of five years.|$|E

5|$|With O'Sullivan, Hadley has {{conducted}} research on utilitarianism {{and the relationship}} between obligations to animals and obligations to needy humans. The scholars argue that there is a conflict in Singer's philosophy between the obligation to aid needy humans and to protect animals, and that Westerners who own pets should, rather than spending large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> extending the lives of their companions, euthanise severely ill animals and instead donate money to aiding those in the developing world.|$|E
5|$|With the {{establishment}} of the Transitional National Government in 2000, a group of businessmen imported about 30 billion shillings of Canadian-printed notes, sparking a collapse of the currency and wide-scale demonstrations and protests in Mogadishu. The value declined by 30 percent (to 13,000 per $1) in three months, {{and by the end of}} the 2001 the currency had fallen to about SoSh 22,000 per US dollar. Further imports of money caused additional disruption and the TNG was forced to buy up large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alan Pegler, {{who first}} saw the {{locomotive}} at the British Empire Exhibition in 1924, in 1961 received £70,000 for his share holding when Northern Rubber was sold to Pegler's Valves, a company started by his grandfather. When Flying Scotsman was due to be scrapped, Pegler stepped in and bought it outright, with the political support of Prime Minister Harold Wilson. He spent large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> {{over the next few}} years having the locomotive restored at Doncaster Works as closely as possible to its LNER condition: the smoke deflectors were removed; the double chimney was replaced by a single chimney; and the tender was replaced by one of the corridor type with which the locomotive had run between 1928 and 1936. It was also repainted in LNER livery.|$|E

In the last episode of every season and in special self-contained episodes with no regular contestants, as Christmas specials with children or charity specials with celebrities, the two couples with the highest <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> went on to the second part of the show and the couple with the smallest <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> left the show.|$|R
50|$|Discount {{policy is}} policy {{taken by the}} central bank to {{increase}} and decrease the money circulation by raising or lowering bank rates. If the Central Bank raised bank rates, its aim to reduce the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> With the high rates, {{people are expected to}} save their money in bank. Therefore, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> will be reduced. Policy to raise bank rates is used to press inflation. Meanwhile, if the central bank lowers bank rates, its aim to increase the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> With the low rates, people are expected to save their money in bank. Thus, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> circulating in the society will increase. The decline in bank rates made by the Central Bank if the economy goes into a recession or if the economy is run into deflation.|$|R

5|$|Brown's {{government}} introduced {{monetary and}} fiscal policies {{to help keep}} the banks afloat during the financial crisis in 2008, and as a result the United Kingdom's national debt increased dramatically. The Government took majority shareholdings in Northern Rock and Royal Bank of Scotland, both of which experienced financial difficulties. Large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> were injected into several other banks, including newly merged HBOS-Lloyds TSB, which received £17billion. Domestic policies focusing on education, employment and health were introduced by the administration. The Labour Party was persuaded to give Gurkhas settlement rights in Britain by the campaign of actress Joanna Lumley and attracted criticism for its handling of the Scottish Government's release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahithe only person to have been convicted over the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. Brown was also dogged by allegations of bullying.|$|E
5|$|Demand {{for tickets}} by Alabama fans {{was so great}} that the Alabama ticket office accidentally {{oversold}} its allotment of tickets. The office neglected to limit purchases on the forms sent to season-ticket holders, and the office received more than 25,000 orders for its 12,500-ticket allotment. An additional 2,000 tickets were given to Alabama, but the school still had to send out more than 10,000 refunds. Alabama's athletics director was heavily criticized for overselling the ticket allotment and for limiting ticket distribution to fans who had contributed large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> to the athletics department. A group of fans disgruntled at the ticket distribution process eventually levied a class-action lawsuit against the athletic director, claiming contract violations.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, workers' pay {{averaged}} between $11 and $18 per hour, {{depending on}} the position. With workweeks averaging between 70 and 84 hours per week, the problem for many workers became {{what to do with}} so much extra money. Teamster Jerry Thornhill, a typical worker, wrote to Money magazine, asking for advice. Thornhill detailed a pay rate of $57,000 per year at a time when members of Congress earned $42,500 annually, professional football players averaged $40,000, and U.S. vice president Nelson Rockefeller earned $62,500. The large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> in the pipeline camps and a lack of entertainment caused frequent gambling games that sometimes involved tens of thousands of dollars. Instead of gambling, other workers saved their money for monthlong vacations to Hawaii or other warm climates, then returned to work with no money remaining.|$|E

5|$|London was {{historically}} a centre {{for trade}} and arbitration, which Peter S. Smedresman, {{writing in the}} Journal of Maritime Law and Commerce divides into three categories of transaction. English commodities trading, through bodies such as the Baltic Exchange, specify that any conflicts are to be settled through arbitration in London, even when the goods being traded have {{no relation to the}} United Kingdom. London has also been a centre for arbitration on maritime issues, and insurance. However, it failed to significantly attract more modern forms of trade, such as major communications developments or high-technology projects, {{due to the nature of}} its arbitration law. These contracts normally involve large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> and are administered by the International Chamber of Commerce, which rarely sent arbitration cases to London due to the individual nature of English law on the subject.|$|E
5|$|Spain had a {{comparatively}} low debt level among advanced economies {{prior to the}} crisis. Its public debt relative to GDP in 2010 was only 60%, more than 20 points less than Germany, France or the US, and more than 60 points less than Italy, Ireland or Greece. Debt was largely avoided by the ballooning tax revenue from the housing bubble, which helped accommodate a decade of increased government spending without debt accumulation. When the bubble burst, Spain spent large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> on bank bailouts. In May 2012, Bankia received a 19 billion euro bailout, {{on top of the}} previous 4.5 billion euros to prop up Bankia. Questionable accounting methods disguised bank losses. During September 2012, regulators indicated that Spanish banks required €59 billion (US$77 billion) in additional capital to offset losses from real estate investments.|$|E
5|$|The CIP was {{a scheme}} whereby US dollars {{were given to}} the South Vietnamese {{government}} treasury. Selected businesspeople were given import licenses that allowed them to purchase US dollars with South Vietnamese currency at a rate far below the market value. The importers then used their American currency to buy US goods, while the Saigon government kept the South Vietnamese currency paid by the businessmen to fund the military and public service. The objective of the mechanism was to inject large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> into the economy in an indirect way, through material goods, so that inflation would be avoided. However, the initiative failed to generate much economic development, as licenseholders spent most of their funds on consumer goods.|$|E
