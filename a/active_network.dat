This capability stems from the exploitation of network devices whose behavior can be changed dynamically by applications, possibly using technologies and architectures originally conceived for mobile code systems.

40|$|Several recent {{proposals}} for an "active networks" architecture advocate {{the placement of}} user-defined computation within the network as a key mechanism to enable {{a wide range of}} new applications and protocols, including reliable multicast transports, mechanisms to foil denial of service attacks, intra-network real-time signal transcoding, and so forth. This laudable goal, however, creates a number of very difficult research problems, and although a number of pioneering research efforts in <b>active</b> <b>networks</b> have solved some of the preliminary small-scale problems, a large number of wide open problems remain. In this paper, we propose an alternative to <b>active</b> <b>networks</b> that addresses a restricted and more tractable subset of the active-networks design space.

This thesis surveys these challenges and applications, and presents how programmable and <b>active</b> <b>networks</b> could well address problems of the mobile Internet such as handoff latency.
