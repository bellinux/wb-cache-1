25|$|In {{addition}} to the Texas Derby, the team also competes in two other MLS rivalry cups. The Brimstone Cup against the Chicago Fire, so named for the allusions to fire in both teams' names when FC Dallas was the Dallas Burn, was inaugurated by the fans in 2001. The Lamar Hunt Pioneer Cup has been contested against Columbus Crew SC since 2007. It is named after Lamar Hunt, who was an investor in both teams. Due to league expansion and realignment, FC Dallas only plays Chicago and Columbus once <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>now</b> in the regular season, {{which has led to}} decreased importance of these two rivalry cups, especially when compared to the Texas Derby.|$|E
25|$|WildTeam {{is working}} with local {{communities}} and the Bangladesh Forest Department to reduce human-tiger conflict in the Bangladesh Sundarbans. For over 100 years people, tigers, and livestock have been injured and killed in the conflict; in recent decades up to 50 people, 80 livestock, and 3 tigers {{have been killed in}} <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> <b>Now,</b> through WildTeam's work, there is a boat-based Tiger Response team that provides first aid, transport, and body retrieval support for people being killed in the forest by tigers. WildTeam has also set up 49 volunteer Village Response Teams that are trained to save tigers that have strayed into the village areas and would be otherwise killed. These village teams are made up of over 350 volunteers, who are also now supporting anti-poaching work and conservation education/awareness activities. WildTeam also works to empower local communities to access the government funds for compensating the loss/injury of livestock and people from the conflict. To monitor the conflict and assess the effectiveness of actions, WildTeam have also set up a human-tiger conflict data collection and reporting system.|$|E

[...] Bob McCann, author of Encyclopedia of African American actresses in film and television (2010), considered it [...] "simply {{one of the most}} haunting R records ever made", while Robert Christgau named it [...] "miraculous" [...] and explained [...] "the miracle being that it's by Diane Warren and you want to hear it again." [...] About.com reviewer Mark Edward Nero named it one of the best R break-up songs and considered it Braxton's [...] "finest moment". He further commented, [...] "damn, this song is so sad it can make people cry for hours at a time." [...] In 1997, [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] won a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.|$|E

500|$|The album sold well {{despite being}} {{initially}} {{pulled from the}} shelves in some stores due to concerns over some of its lyrical content. [...] The band and its record label later added a Parental Advisory sticker to the album, and some stores ordered amended copies of the album. Erna commented in Rolling Stone magazine stating, [...] "Our record {{has been in the}} marketplace for more than <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>now</b> without a parental advisory sticker and this is the one and only complaint... Stickers and lyrics are by nature subjective... We have decided to put a sticker on the record". This controversy did not appear to adversely affect album sales but, according to Erna, helped, [...] "It's almost taunting kids {{to go out and get}} the record to see what we're saying on it". The album also had four successful singles which were [...] "Whatever", [...] "Keep Away", [...] "Voodoo" [...] and [...] "Bad Religion".|$|E

2500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} {{supposed to be}} released on Good Friday, but was released a day early on Thursday, following {{the release of the}} West and DJ Khaled collaboration track [...] "Cold". The track was premiered by Funkmaster Flex's Hot 97 radio show and was released onto the Internet the following day onto West's official website. The song serves as the first official single from Cruel Summer, an album by West's record label GOOD Music. The release of the track continued West's GOOD Fridays, a music giveaway that provided free MP3 downloads every week, which had been on hiatus since December 2010. The song features Big Sean and Pusha T, rappers both signed to West's GOOD Music, along with 2 Chainz, all delivering a verse each along with West. Speaking about his feature, 2 Chainz stated that [...] "I've done a lot of work with 'Ye for, like, <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>now,</b> {{and it was one of}} those songs where I called him and I told him, 'Man, play my verse over the phone because I don't remember.' That's a good look to add to the résumé, for real." [...] According to 2 Chainz, he had no idea that the song was going to be a single.|$|E

2500|$|The Knights {{currently}} have games scheduled through 2023. Among the games scheduled are finishing a home-and-away series with Stanford (at home). They {{also have an}} away game against Texas (2023). Of note is that the game against the Longhorns will be {{the final game of}} a three-game contract between UCF and Texas. The contract was organized as such: for the first game, the Knights would host the Longhorns to open up their new stadium, Spectrum Stadium; the remaining games (one was played in 2009) would be played at Darrell K Royal–Texas Memorial Stadium, the home stadium of the Longhorns, as a [...] "repayment" [...] for opening UCF's new stadium. The Knights are near the end of a 6-game series with FIU from 2011–2016, which started with a 2011 away game at FIU Stadium in Miami. Because the 2014 game was canceled, the remaining FIU games were delayed <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> <b>now</b> ending the series in 2017. One of the recently announced home-and-away series is a future home-and-away series with in-state opponent FAU in 2018 and 2019, the first one being in Spectrum Stadium on September 22, 2018 and the second one being in FAU Stadium on September 7, 2019. UCF also announced a home-and-away series with Georgia Tech with the first game in Spectrum Stadium on September 16, 2017 and the second being an away game on September 19, 2020, as well as a home and away series with the Pittsburgh, with the Knights hosting on September 29, 2018 and visiting Pittsburgh on September 21, 2019.|$|E
