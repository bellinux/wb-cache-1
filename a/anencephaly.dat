5|$|The National Academy of Sciences {{questioned}} Neel's procedure {{which did}} not filter the Kure population for possible radiation exposure. Overall, while a statistically insignificant increase in birth defects occurred directly after the bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Neel and others noted that in approximately 50 humans who were of an early gestational age {{at the time of}} the bombing and who were all within about 1km from the hypocenter, an increase in microencephaly and <b>anencephaly</b> was observed upon birth, with the incidence of these two particular malformations being nearly 3 times what was to be expected when compared to the control group in Kure.|$|E
5|$|While {{some of the}} {{description}} may have been accurate, many puritanical embellishments were added to better fit the moral story being portrayed by the authorities. The modern medical condition that best fits {{the description}} of the infant is <b>anencephaly,</b> meaning partial or complete absence of a brain. This episode was just the beginning of the attention emanating from Dyer's personal tragedy. The religion of the Puritans demanded a close look at all aspects of one's life for signs of God's approval or disapproval. Even becoming a member of the Puritan church in New England required a public confession of faith, and any behavior that was viewed by the clergy as being unorthodox required a theological examination by the church, followed by a public confession and repentance by the offender. Such microscopic inspection caused even private matters to become looked at publicly for the purpose of instruction, and Dyer's tragedy was widely examined for signs of God's judgment. This led to a highly subjective form of justice, an example of which was the 1656 hanging of Ann Hibbins whose offense was simply being resented by her neighbor. In Winthrop's eyes Dyer's case was unequivocal, and he was convinced that her monstrous birth was a clear signal of God's displeasure with the antinomian heretics. Winthrop felt that it was quite providential that the discovery of the monstrous birth occurred exactly when Anne Hutchinson was excommunicated from the local body of believers, and exactly one week before Dyer's husband was questioned in the Boston church for his heretic opinions.|$|E

25|$|The {{youngest}} {{organ donor}} {{was a baby}} with <b>anencephaly,</b> born in 2015, who lived for only 100 minutes and donated his kidneys to an adult with renal failure. The oldest known organ donor was a 107-year-old Scottish woman, whose corneas were donated after her death in 2016. The oldest known organ donor for an internal organ was a 92-year-old Texas man, whose family chose to donate his liver after {{he died of a}} brain hemorrhage.|$|E
25|$|A study {{examining}} 806 {{women who}} had babies with birth defects between 1997 and 2006, and 849 {{women who had}} healthy babies, found that smog in the San Joaquin Valley area of California was linked to two types of neural tube defects: spina bifida (a condition involving, among other manifestations, certain malformations of the spinal column), and <b>anencephaly</b> (the underdevelopment or absence of part {{or all of the}} brain, which if not fatal usually results in profound impairment).|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish between brain death and states that {{may be difficult to}} differentiate from brain death, (such as barbiturate overdose, alcohol intoxication, sedative overdose, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, coma, and chronic vegetative states). Some comatose patients can recover to pre-coma or near pre-coma level of functioning, and some patients with severe irreversible neurological dysfunction will nonetheless retain some lower brain functions, such as spontaneous respiration, despite the losses of both cortex and brain stem functionality. Such is the case with <b>anencephaly.</b>|$|E
25|$|The role of {{folic acid}} during {{pregnancy}} {{is vital to}} normal development {{of the nervous system}} in the fetus. A deficiency in folate levels of a pregnant woman could potentially result in neural tube disorder, a debilitating condition in which the tubes of the central nervous system do not fuse entirely. NTDs are {{not to be confused with}} spina bifida, which does not involve neural elements. Neural tube defects can present in a number of ways as a result of the improper closure at various points of the neural tube. The clinical spectrum of the disorder includes encephalocele, craniorachischisis, and <b>anencephaly.</b> In addition, these defects can also be classified as open, if neural tissue is exposed or covered only by membrane, or can be classified as closed, if the tissue is covered by normal skin.|$|E
25|$|Spina bifida is {{believed}} to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. After having one child with the condition or if one of the parents has the condition, there is a 4% chance that the next child will also be affected. Not having enough folate in the diet before and during pregnancy also plays a significant role. Other risk factors include certain antiseizure medications, obesity, and poorly controlled diabetes. Diagnosis may occur either before or after a child is born. Before birth if a blood test or amniocentesis finds a high level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), there is a higher risk of spina bifida. Ultrasound examination may also detect the problem. Medical imaging can confirm the diagnosis after birth. It is a type of neural tube defect with other types including <b>anencephaly</b> and encephalocele.|$|E
25|$|Many {{studies have}} found that the {{frequency}} of occurrence of certain congenital malformations depends on the sex of the child (table). For example, pyloric stenosis occurs more often in males while congenital hip dislocation is four to five times more likely to occur in females. Among children with one kidney, there are approximately twice as many males, whereas among children with three kidneys there are approximately 2.5 times more females. The same pattern is observed among infants with excessive number of ribs, vertebrae, teeth and other organs which in a process of evolution have undergone reduction—among them there are more females. Contrarily, among the infants with their scarcity, there are more males. <b>Anencephaly</b> is shown to occur approximately twice as frequently in females. The number of boys born with 6 fingers is two times higher than the number of girls. Now various techniques are available to detect congenital anomalies in fetus before birth.|$|E
2500|$|If {{the failure}} is instead in the cranial neuropore, <b>anencephaly</b> occurs. [...] In this condition, the brain tissue is {{directly}} {{exposed to the}} amniotic fluid, and is subsequently degraded.|$|E
2500|$|The {{herpes simplex}} virus can cause microcephaly, microphthalmus (abnormally small eyeballs), retinal {{dysplasia}}, hepatosplenomegaly, and mental retardation. [...] Both microphthalmus and retinal dysplasia can cause blindness. [...] However, the most common symptom in infants is an inflammatory response that develops {{during the first three}} weeks of life. [...] Hyperthermia causes <b>anencephaly,</b> which is when part of the brain and skull are absent in the infant. [...] Mother exposure to toxoplasmosis can cause cerebral calcification, hydrocephalus (causes mental disabilities), and mental retardation in infants. [...] Other birth abnormalities have been reported as well, such as chorioretinitis, microphthalmus, and ocular defects. [...] Syphilis causes congenital deafness, mental retardation, and diffuse fibrosis in organs, such as the liver and lungs, if the embryo is exposed.|$|E
2500|$|Nutrition {{disorders}} and nutritional deficits may cause neurodevelopmental disorders, such as spina bifida, and the rarely occurring <b>anencephaly,</b> {{both of which}} are neural tube defects with malformation and dysfunction of the nervous system and its supporting structures, leading to serious physical disability and emotional sequelae. The most common nutritional cause of neural tube defects is folic acid deficiency in the mother, a B vitamin usually found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and milk products. (Neural tube defects are also caused by medications and other environmental causes, many of which interfere with folate metabolism, thus they are considered to have multifactorial causes.) Another deficiency, iodine deficiency, produces a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders ranging from mild emotional disturbance to severe mental retardation. (see also cretinism) ...|$|E
2500|$|A 1978 study {{examined}} the effect of sunlight on folate – a vitamin B complex – levels. The study found that even short periods of intense sunlight are able to halve folate levels if someone has light skin. Low folate levels are correlated with neural tube defects, such as <b>anencephaly</b> and spina bifida. UV rays can strip away folate, which {{is important to the}} development of healthy foetuses. In these abnormalities children are born with incomplete brain or spinal cord. Nina Jablonski, a professor of anthropology and expert on evolution of human skin coloration, [...] found several cases in which mother’s visits to tanning studios were connected to neural tube defects in early pregnancy. She also found that folate was crucial to sperm development; some male contraception drugs are based on folate inhibition. It has been found that folate may have been {{the driving force behind the}} evolution of dark skin.|$|E
2500|$|There are few well-controlled {{studies of}} {{venlafaxine}} in pregnant women. A study released in May 2010 by the Canadian Medical Association Journal suggests use of venlafaxine doubles {{the risk of}} miscarriage. Consequently, venlafaxine should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. A large case-control study done {{as part of the}} National Birth Defects Prevention Study and published in 2012 found a significant association of venlafaxine use during pregnancy and several birth defects including <b>anencephaly,</b> cleft palate, septal heart defects and coarctation of the aorta.Polen Kara ND, Rasmussen SA et al. Birth Defects Res Clin Mol Teratol. 2013:97;28-35[...] Prospective studies have not shown any statistically significant congenital malformations. There have, however, been some reports of self-limiting effects on newborn infants. As with other serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), these effects are generally short-lived, lasting only 3 to 5 days, and rarely resulting in severe complications.|$|E

Craniorachischisis occurs in about 1 of every 1000 live births, but various physical and chemical tests can detect neural tube closure during early pregnancy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anencephaly</b> can be {{diagnosed}} before delivery {{with a high}} degree of accuracy. Although <b>anencephaly</b> is a fatal condition, the option of abortion is dependent on the abortion laws in the state. According to a 2013 Report, 26% of the World's population reside in a country where abortion is generally prohibited. In 2012, Brazil extended the right of abortion to mothers with anencephalic fetuses. This decision is, however, receiving much disapproval by several religious groups.|$|E

50|$|There {{are four}} main signs of acalvaria: {{absence of the}} flat bones of the cranial vault, absence of the dura mater and muscles {{associated}} with it, skull abnormalities, {{and the absence of}} a skull cap. This condition can be diagnosed prior to birth using ultrasonography. Physicians often use magnetic resonance imaging to confirm the diagnosis because in utero, acalvaria is sometimes confused with <b>anencephaly</b> or encephalocele. A distinguishable difference is that with <b>anencephaly,</b> the cerebral hemispheres are missing, but with acalvaria, all parts of the cerebrum are usually present and developed, whereas parts of the calvarium are missing.|$|E
