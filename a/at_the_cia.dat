5|$|Scholars today remain {{divided on}} the merits of the {{electronic}} barrier system and the efficacy of the bombing campaigns that it directed. The claims of destruction made by the U.S. Air Force, both during and after the war, were originally taken as given. The only exception to this rule was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> which discounted Air Force claims at the time by as much as 75 percent. This was understandable {{due to the fact that}} the Vietnamese were basically silent during the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, 2009, CIA Director Leon Panetta {{told the}} Senate and House {{intelligence}} committees that the CIA withheld {{information about a}} secret counter-terrorism program from Congress for eight years on direct orders from Cheney. Intelligence and Congressional officials have said the unidentified program did not involve the CIA interrogation program and did not involve domestic intelligence activities. They have said the program was started by the counter-terrorism center <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> shortly after the attacks of September 11, 2001, but never became fully operational, involving planning and some training that took place off and on from 2001 until this year. The Wall Street Journal reported, citing former intelligence officials familiar with the matter, that the program {{was an attempt to}} carry out a 2001 presidential authorization to capture or kill al Qaeda operatives.|$|E

5|$|Robin Raphel {{began her}} career in the U.S. {{government}} as an analyst <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> after graduating with her master's degree. After leaving Iran she joined the diplomatic corps and assisted USAID in Islamabad as an economics analyst. In 1978, Raphel returned to the United States and joined the State Department.

In 1991, she took the assignment of Political Counselor at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, India.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) {{documents}} declassified in 2006 {{show that}} the capture of Eichmann caused alarm <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> and West German Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND). Both organizations had known {{for at least two}} years that Eichmann was hiding in Argentina, but did not act, because it did not serve their interests in the Cold War to do so. Both were concerned about what Eichmann might say in his testimony about West German national security advisor Hans Globke, who had coauthored several antisemitic Nazi laws (including the Nuremberg Laws). The documents also revealed that both agencies had used some of Eichmann's former Nazi colleagues to spy on European communist countries.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} season, Parrish, {{who appears to}} have been fired from the FBI, is working a desk job as an analyst <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> while living with Shelby and {{continuing}} her relationship with Ryan, who later becomes her fiancé. Flashbacks reveal that she is working undercover for the FBI as a CIA recruit. She is tasked with uncovering a rogue faction of the CIA called the AIC. At The Farm, she is joined with other recruits, including Harry Doyle (Russell Tovey), Dayana Mampasi (Pearl Thusi), Sebastian Chen (David Lim), León Velez (Aarón Díaz), Leigh Davis (Heléne Yorke), and Jeremy Miller (David Call). Ryan later joins the other recruits at the site, much to Alex's surprise. Some time after her recruitment, Alex has a meeting with Matthew Keyes and Miranda Shaw. It is revealed that she was recruited by the CIA as part of a covert mission to establish any potential threats within the agency. Ryan is also recruited by the agency for the same mission. Owen Hall (Blair Underwood) is confirmed to be the primary CIA instructor for the training site at TheFarm. In addition, Lydia Hall (Tracy Ifeachor) is later revealed to be another trainer on-site. Alex and the other recruits undergo a series of training assessments in order to become future case officers. After being kicked out of TheFarm by Lydia, Alex goes back to working as an analyst. In addition, she breaks off her engagement with Ryan some time before the 2018 G-20 hostage crisis in New York.|$|E

50|$|In September 1984, ABC News {{broadcast}} a two-part investigation supporting his claims. <b>The</b> <b>CIA</b> denied any connection and filed a formal {{complaint with the}} Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>CIA</b> also {{experimented with}} a small {{remote-controlled}} reconnaissance aircraft, the Predator, to try to spot Bin Laden in Afghanistan. A series of flights in autumn 2000, overseen by CTC officials and flown by USAF drone pilots from a control room <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA's</b> Langley headquarters, produced probable sightings of the al-Qaeda leader.|$|R
25|$|In his {{testimony}} to the grand jury, Libby testified that both he and Vice President Cheney believed that Joseph Wilson was qualified for the mission, though they wondered {{if he would have}} been selected had his wife not worked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA.</b>|$|E
25|$|Two {{days later}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> headquarters, Palmer Smith, Osbourne's former superior, and his {{director}} learn that information from Osbourne {{has been given}} to the Russian Embassy.

25|$|After being {{consulted}} by her superiors <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> {{about whom}} {{to send on}} the mission, Valerie E.

25|$|BLITZER: So, {{when you}} told Robert Novak that Joe Wilson, the former U.S. ambassador's wife, worked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> and she was {{involved}} somehow in getting him this trip to Africa {{to look for the}} enriched uranium, if there were enriched uranium going to Iraq, you simply assumed that she was not a clandestine officer of the CIA.|$|E
25|$|Then an OSS friend {{offered him}} a job <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> and Colby accepted. Colby spent the next 12 years in the field, first in Stockholm, Sweden.

5000|$|The {{criticism}} continued {{after president}} Barack Obama {{took office in}} 2008. Prince said he believes that much of this criticism stems from politics.

[...] "But when it became politically expedient to do so, someone threw me under the bus." ...|$|R
5000|$|Chamorro was miffed when <b>the</b> FDN directorate, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA's</b> prompting, {{appointed}} Adolfo Calero as {{its president}} in October 1983. His not-so-private grumblings that his Chamorro lineage was more illustrious than Calero's {{did not help}} their deteriorating relations. Chamorro was forced out in November 1984, in {{the fallout from the}} furor over <b>the</b> <b>CIA's</b> Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare, labeled by the press a [...] "murder manual." [...] He turned against the rebel movement, even submitting an affidavit for the Sandinista government before the International Court of Justice in Nicaragua v. United States.|$|R

25|$|The first {{dining hall}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> {{was built in}} 1906 as a chapel; the Jesuits had {{constructed}} it as their main chapel to replace smaller chapels in the building.

Upon the CIA's purchase, the chapel was converted into a dining hall, known as Alumni Hall. In 2002, the dining hall was renovated and renamed Farquharson Hall.|$|E
