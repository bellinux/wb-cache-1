50|$|Infringing {{the health}} and safety {{regulations}} in force at that time, the employees of Dynamit Nobel were exposed for years, with little protection, to this harmful substance which later turned out to be carcinogenic. Therefore, they were heavily contaminated by vinyl chloride gas or by cleaning up the autoclaves. At this time, most of the other manufacturers of PVC had already put into place systems of production, which were less dangerous for the health. The same had not been done at Dynamit Nobel because of financial considerations. Moreover, regular controls were not made, others were partially manipulated or the results were kept secret. Also, the company made an important contribution to the region, regularly obtained extensions of time to apply the regulations. Contamination due to vinyl chloride was so severe that for years in the company, the employees complained of damages relating to their liver, anemia, finger circulation disorder resulting in <b>acro-osteolysis</b> (necrosis of the first phalanxes), as well as headaches and dizziness. Cancers also resulted from the exposure.|$|E

40|$|Background: Primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (PHOA 1) {{is a rare}} genetic {{condition}} {{caused by}} mutation of the hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HDPG) gene leading to prostaglandin excess, with digital clubbing, <b>acro-osteolysis,</b> periostitis, arthropathy and skin changes including pachyderma, hyperhydrosis and excessive facial furrowing [1]. Radiological findings previously described include plain radiographic changes with irregular periosteal proliferation, cortical thickening of long bones and <b>acro-osteolysis.</b> Bone scintigraphy identifies characteristic changes of symmetrically increased pericor-tical linear uptake of the tracer along the distal ends of long bones [2]. Joint US examination {{has been reported in}} one case only revealing synovitis and inflammation. Management options described in case reports include long-term NSAIDs, bisphosphonates, DMARDS, infliximab and arthroscopic synovectomy with variable symptomatic relief, and no improvement in established plain radiographic changes...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{examine the}} {{outcomes}} of hand radiographic x-rays in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and to identify risk factors for the progression of hand radiographic lesions in a prospective cohort. Methods Dual time-point x-rays were systematically performed after a median interval of 5 years (range 4 - 7 years) in 103 consecutively recruited patients with SSc. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models evaluated predictors of progression of hand radiographic lesions. Results Radiographic progression of erosive arthritis, <b>acro-osteolysis,</b> calcinosis and flexion contracture occurred in 24, 22, 27 and 18 patients, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis did not identify any predictor of the progression of erosive arthritis. Digital ulcers were shown independently to predict the progression of <b>acro-osteolysis</b> and calcinosis (HR 12. 43, 95 % CI 1. 97 to 88. 40 and 3. 16, 95 % CI 1. 22 % to 9. 43 %, respectively). The diffuse cutaneous subset was shown to be an independent predictor of the progression of flexion contracture (HR 7. 52, 95 % CI 1. 21 to 43. 93). Conclusion The results highlight the striking level of hand radiographic lesions in SSc and suggest close monitoring of patients with the diffuse cutaneous subset for the occurrence or worsening of this complication. The results also show that severe peripheral vascular involvement predicts both <b>acro-osteolysis</b> and calcinosis, highlighting their vascular background...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Bone {{turnover}} {{is regulated}} locally by osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator of NFkappaB ligand (RANK-L); {{it is not}} known how the circulating concentrations of these cytokines reflect renal osteodystrophy. METHODS: We measured serum OPG, RANK-L, parathyroid hormone (iPTH), collagen C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide (betaCrossLaps), and bone densitometry (BMD) in 79 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRF) undergoing dialysis. A hand X-ray of these patients was also analyzed. Controls were 65 healthy subjects. RESULTS: ESRF patients had high OPG and RANK-L levels; RANK-L was higher in hemodialysis than in peritoneal dialysis. OPG and RANK-L did not depend on iPTH. The bone markers were significantly increased and correlated with serum iPTH, but not with OPG or RANK-L; neither OPG nor RANK-L correlated significantly with BMD. OPG was significantly higher in patients with <b>acro-osteolysis.</b> CONCLUSIONS: OPG and RANK-L serum concentrations do not strongly reflect bone status in ESRF.

40|$|OBJECTIVE:: To {{define the}} burden of hand {{radiological}} damage in systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients, compared with a control group. METHODS:: Both hands of 167 SSc patients and 168 hands (82 right and 86 left) of age- and gender-matched controls were imaged by conventional radiograph. Two musculoskeletal radiologists semiquantitatively scored the following lesions: tuft <b>acro-osteolysis,</b> tuft calcinosis, joint space narrowings, marginal erosions, surface erosions, collapse arthropathies, periarticular calcifications, and juxta-articular osteoporosis, at the following areas: tufts, distal interphalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, metacarpophalangeal, carpal, and first carpometacarpal joints. Clinical and functional characteristics of the 167 SSc patients {{were obtained from the}} Belgian Systemic Sclerosis Cohort database. RESULTS:: Tuft <b>acro-osteolysis</b> and calcinosis were the most common findings observed in SSc patients and were almost absent in controls. SSc patients displaying tuft acro-osteolysis/calcinosis suffered from more severe disease. Arthropathies were infrequently detected and mainly consisted of a mixture of osteoarthritis-related changes (joint space narrowing and surface erosions) -also observed in controls-and of 2 types of rare SSc-associated arthropathies: a rheumatoid arthritis-like pattern, characterized by marginal erosions (n = 7 patients), and a collapse arthropathy (n = 6 patients), characterized by pressure erosions and joint subluxation.

40|$|Mandibuloacral {{dysplasia}} (MAD) is an {{autosomal recessive}} disorder characterized by hypoplasia of the mandible and clavicles, <b>acro-osteolysis</b> and lipodystrophy due to mutations in LMNA or ZMPSTE 24. Only six MAD patients are reported so far with ZMPSTE 24 mutations and limited phenotypic {{data are available}} for them. Here, we report on two brothers (4 years and 9 months old) with early onset MAD due to ZMPSTE 24 mutations in whom thin skin was noted as early as 5 months of age. Both had micrognathia, mottled hyperpigmentation, and enlarged fontanelles but little evidence of lipodystrophy. There was no delay of mental development. The older brother showed small pinched nose, short clavicles, <b>acro-osteolysis,</b> stunted growth, joint stiffness, and repeated fractures. There {{was no evidence of}} renal disease. Both patients were compound heterozygotes harboring a previously reported missense ZMPSTE 24 mutation, p. Pro 248 Leu and a novel null mutation, p. Trp 450 stop. These patients and the review of literature reveals that compared to MAD patients with LMNA mutations, those with ZMPSTE 24 mutations develop manifestations earlier in life. Other distinguishing features in MAD due to ZMPSTE 24 mutations may include premature birth, renal disease, calcified skin nodules, and lack of acanthosis nigricans. We conclude that in patients with MAD due to ZMPSTE 24 mutations, the onset of disease manifestations such as thin skin and micrognathia occurs as early as 5 months of age.
