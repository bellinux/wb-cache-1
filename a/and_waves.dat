40|$|The {{electric}} power generation of co-located offshore wind turbines <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> energy converters along the California coast is investigated. Meteorological wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> data from the National Buoy Data Center were used to estimate the hourly power output from offshore wind turbines <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> energy converters at the sites of the buoys. The data set from 12 buoys consists of over 1, 000, 000 h of simultaneous hourly mean wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> measurements. At the buoys, offshore wind farms would have capacity factors ranging from 30 % to 50 %, <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> farms would have capacity factors ranging from 22 % to 29 %. An analysis of the power output indicates that co-located offshore wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> energy farms generate less variable power output than a wind or wave farm operating alone. The reduction in variability results from the low temporal correlation of the resources and occurs on all time scales. Aggregate power from a co-located wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> farm achieves reductions in variability equivalent to aggregating power from two offshore wind farms approximately 500 km apart or two wave farms approximately 800 km apart. Combined wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> farms in California would have less than 100 h of no power output per year, compared to over 1000 h for offshore wind or over 200 h for wave farms alone. Ten offshore farms of wind, wave, or both modeled in the California power system would have capacity factors during the summer ranging from 21 % (all wave) to 36 % (all wind) with combined wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> farms between 21 % and 36 %. The capacity credits for these farms range from 16 % to 24 % with some combined wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> farms achieving capacity credits {{equal to or greater}} than a 100 % wind farm because of their reduction in power output variability...|$|R

Since the 1980 s, X-band marine radar has evolved {{as one of the}} remote sensing instruments for such purposes since its sea surface images contain considerable wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> information. The maturity and accuracy of X-band marine radar wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> measurements have already enabled relevant commercial products to be used in real-world applications. The goal {{of this paper is to}} provide a comprehensive review of the state of the art algorithms for ocean wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> information extraction from X-band marine radar data. Wind measurements are mainly based on the dependence of radar image intensities on wind direction <b>and</b> speed. <b>Wave</b> parameters can be obtained from radar-derived wave spectra or radar image textures for non-coherent radar and from surface radial velocity for coherent radar. In this review, the principles of the methodologies are described, the performances are compared, and the pros and cons are discussed. Specifically, recent developments for wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> measurements are highlighted. These include the mitigation of rain effects on wind measurements <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> height estimation without external calibrations.

We determine the effects of the latitudinal distributions of density <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> power on the electron precipitation loss timescale due to combined scattering by VLF chorus, ELF hiss <b>and</b> EMIC <b>waves.</b> Accurate modeling of radiation belt electron dynamics requires observational data on the global distributions of particle number density <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> power.|$|R

40|$|AbstractCell {{migration}} {{is driven by}} actin polymerization {{at the leading edge}} of lamellipodia, where WASP family verprolin-homologous proteins (WAVEs) activate Arp 2 / 3 complex. When fibroblasts are stimulated with PDGF, formation of peripheral ruffles precedes that of dorsal ruffles in lamellipodia.

During directed cell migration in the absence of extracellular matrix (ECM), cells migrate with peripheral ruffles at the leading edge <b>and</b> <b>WAVE</b> 2, but not WAVE 1, is essential. In contrast, both <b>WAVE</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>WAVE</b> 2 are essential for invading migration into ECM, suggesting that the leading edge in ECM has characteristics of both ruffles. WAVE 1 is colocalized with ECM-degrading enzyme MMP- 2 in dorsal ruffles, <b>and</b> <b>WAVE</b> 1 -, but not WAVE 2 -, dependent migration requires MMP activity.

Heavy rainfall from intense thunderstorms caused minor flooding as they crossed the coastline during the subsequent days; precipitation in the state peaked at 14.13inches (358.9mm) at East Bay Bayou, the highest recorded rainfall total {{in association with the}} hurricane. Sustained winds peaked at 69mph (112km/h) with gusts to 85mph (137km/h) at Sea Rim State Park; the National Weather Service estimates gusts exceeded 90mph (145km/h) in southwestern Jefferson County and extreme southeastern Chambers County. In the Golden Pass Ship Channel, an unofficial report of a 115mph (185km/h) wind gust was relayed to the National Hurricane Center.

40|$|Background: Electroencephalogram based {{studies done}} {{elsewhere}} suggest that epileptiform activity originates predominantly {{from the left}} cortical hemisphere. There is evidence that partial epilepsies (focal spike <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> epileptiform discharges on tracings) connotes focal;secondary structural cortical dysfunction. Studies seeking similar findings have not been done locally. Objective: To review electroencephalograms (BEGs) done at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH); looking for various types of epileptiform discharges and their cerebral cortex of origin. Design: Retrospective observational study. Setting: Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya- from January 1986 to June 2004 Results: A total 10431 EEG records were reviewed. Ninety Eight percent of referrals for EEG evaluation was for clinical differential diagnosis of epilepsy. AbnormalBEGs comprised 32. 2 % of the study population. Epileptiform abnormalities (i. e. focal spike and wave,generalized spike <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> <b>and</b> 3 Hz spike <b>and</b> <b>wave)</b> discharges accounted for 75. 2 % of all abnormal EEG waveform discharges. Of the epileptiform abnormalities, focal spike <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> discharges comprised 71 %. Focal spike <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> discharge implies a possible secondary aetiology of epilepsy. The left cerebral hemisphere was the origin of 49. 8 % of focal spike <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> epileptiform EEG discharges. Multifocal loci in cerebral cortices (i. e. frontal, temporal and parietal) were the foci of origin of abnormal EEG waveforms in 69. 9 % of recordings. Conclusion: Focal spike <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> epileptiform discharges, with attendant likely secondary aetiology of epilepsy is predominantly evident in this study. It contrasts findings from western literature. The left cerebral hemisphere is more epileptogenic as is noted in other studies...|$|R

Beach erosion and light rainfall was reported along much of the coastline, although the precipitation was beneficial in ending droughts in South Carolina and New England. High waves destroyed one house in North Carolina. Damage was heaviest in New England, where several buildings were damaged and thousands were left without power. The passage of Ginny resulted in a snow storm across eastern New England, particularly in northern Maine, where it killed two people.
