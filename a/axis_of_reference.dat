40|$|The {{role of the}} extraretinal {{factors in}} the {{programmation}} of goal-directed arm movements and in the elaboration of an internal representation of the visual space was investigated. The experimental method used for understanding these mechanisms is {{the analysis of the}} final precision of visually guided arm movements. The results of the author's study suggest that (1) the target location is internally represented in a body-centred reference system, (2) this information is used to control the final arm position and (3) orienting the eyes towards the target changes the egocentric <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> used for building the internal representation of the body midline (eyes axis replaced by head-trunk axis). This hierarchical organization could be explained by the necessity of a stable body-related reference point in order to ensure a stable visual perception of the surrounding space, despite moving one of the egocentric axes with respect to the others...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of {{this thesis}} {{is to explore}} space {{representations}} in preschool children 4 to 6 {{years of age and}} their development through instructional intervention. Based on empirical research data, the importance of space abilities and space representations of cognitive development is presented as well as their development model in children. The survey involved 45 children and was conducted using experimental material consisting of 20 original items made with children's building material LEGO. One can conclude that children show a continuous improvement in the experiment's task performance as a result of continuous improvement and understanding of involved spatial concepts as well as strategies used to solve tasks. Four year old children start with a topological approach only resulting in partial processing of spatial information, 5 year olds successfully manage information to an <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> and 6 year olds are able to successfully coordinate data on two axes of reference. Also, children are capable from the fourth year of age to process information such as number of items, collinearity, right-left, and later on details such as relative position of objects and their position in a reference system. The possibility of accelerating preschoolers learning of spatial concepts -improvement of space representations- is also investigated through appropriate instructional intervention. The second experiment involved 52 children aged 5 to 6 years of age, divided into three kindergarden groups/classrooms, two experimental groups and one control group. It is noted with the help of tasks based on results of the first experiment and measurements before and after instructional intervention, a statistically significant improvement in both experimental groups compared with the control group. This improvement is of 14 months compared to cognitive development of children without Didactic Intervention. It is thus concluded that in preschool age it is feasible to approach and improve children's space representations with appropriate instructional interventions based on teaching to cooperative groups with appropriately structured mathematical activities...|$|E

50|$|The DHD method {{seeks to}} measure the {{distribution}} of stresses along the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>reference</b> hole. The relationship between the original residual stresses acting on the reference hole and the measured changes in the hole diameter creates {{the basis of the}} analysis. The DHD technique uses an elastic analysis to convert the measured distortions <b>of</b> the <b>reference</b> hole into a residual stress profile. The accuracy of the results is dependent on sources of error in the measurement, but is also dependent on the elastic modulus of the material. A lower elastic modulus will result in larger distortions for a given stress release, meaning a higher measurement resolution and thus a greater achievable accuracy. The DHD technique has a nominal accuracy of ±10MPa for Aluminium, ±30MPa for Steel and ±15MPa for Titanium.|$|R

30|$|A third step {{consists}} of the determination of all direct neighborhood relations between the final list of patch candidates (cf. Figure 3 d). This is accomplished via a Delaunay triangulation [28] using as seed points the centers of the patch candidates. Next, the obtained triangulation is pruned of the edges diverging significantly from the horizontal or vertical, as regarded from a coordinate system given by the main axes of the color target. Discarding edges which deviate more than 20 % from the median edge length represents an efficient pruning method. Finding one of the axes of the color target can at this point be readily accomplished by determining the median skew angle from the remaining edges. The other <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>reference</b> target is always considered to be perpendicular to the determined axis.|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is the design and station keeping of repeat-groundtrack orbits for Sun-synchronous satellite. A method to compute the semimajor <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the orbit is {{presented}} together with a station-keeping strategy to compensate for the perturbation due to the atmospheric drag. The results show that the nodal period converges gradually with the increase of the order used in the zonal perturbations up to J 15. A differential correction algorithm is performed to obtain the nominal semimajor <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>reference</b> orbit from the inputs of the desired nodal period, eccentricity, inclination and argument of perigee. To keep the satellite in the proximity of the repeat-groundtrack condition, a practical orbit maintenance strategy is proposed in the presence of errors in the orbital measurements and control, {{as well as in the}} estimation <b>of</b> the semimajor <b>axis</b> decay rate. The performance of the maintenance strategy is assessed via the Monte Carlo simulation and the validation in a high fidelity model.

Rods are rotated first round the origin <b>of</b> global <b>reference</b> frame simultaneously, the attached point and further ones round {{the end of the}} previous one.

The identification of cell types from structure, a classic method, relies on the time-consuming step of arbor tracing.
