5|$|Although the {{navigation}} ceased to operate from January 1869, Woodmill Lock remained in use, to enable barges to reach Gaters Mill at West End, {{which was on}} the main river channel just above {{the start of the}} first cut. Most of the bridges over {{the navigation}} were owned by the navigation, and their condition deteriorated. The manager, Mr Bulpett, was notified that he had 21 days to repair Shawford Bridge in 1879. He replied to the Winchester Highway Board that the navigation was insolvent, and he would help them to transfer responsibility for it to the county council. The Board carried out temporary repairs, when Bulpett <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> navigation would meet the full cost of repairing it properly if it ever reopened. The following year, Bulpett was threatened with legal action over the state of Bishopstoke Bridge, but at this point it was <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> navigation had no income, and could not be sold, and so the county would have to maintain the bridges.|$|E

Nevertheless, Army Secretary Caldera said early in the investigation that he couldn't rule out prosecutions, a statement that survivors later complained may have deterred some 7th Cavalry veterans from testifying.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} remaster was mostly positive. Several critics {{noted that some}} features like the inventory system and the insistence on having to revisit previously explored areas have not aged very well, but generally <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> remaster was a solid revival of a classic. The new control scheme was also considered more intuitive and satisfying, especially for new players.|$|E
5|$|In Gideon v. Wainwright, Justice Harlan <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Constitution {{required}} {{states to}} provide attorneys for defendants {{who could not}} afford their own counsel.

5|$|It is {{generally}} <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Chelicerata contain the classes Arachnida (spiders, scorpions, mites, etc.), Xiphosura (horseshoe crabs) and Eurypterida (sea scorpions, extinct).

The Pycnogonida (sea spiders) were traditionally classified as chelicerates, but some features suggest they may be representatives of the earliest arthropods from which the well-known groups such as chelicerates evolved.|$|E
