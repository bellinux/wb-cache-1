5|$|On July 11, 2014, Allen re-signed {{with the}} Pacers. He was most {{effective}} {{earlier in the}} season due to injuries of other players. He missed a January 31, 2015 game against the Sacramento Kings due to <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> knee. Allen mainly played as a backup power forward and averaged 5.0 points and 5.1 rebounds in his first full season with the Pacers.|$|E

5000|$|A lesion {{caused by}} {{recurrence}} of a latent herpes simplex infection {{can occur in}} the corner of the mouth. Really this is herpes labialis (<b>a</b> cold <b>sore),</b> and is sometimes termed [...] "angular herpes simplex". <b>A</b> cold <b>sore</b> at the corner of the mouth behaves similarly to elsewhere on the lips, and follows a pattern of vesicle (blister) formation followed by rupture leaving <b>a</b> crusted <b>sore</b> which resolves in about 7-10 days, and recurs in the same spot periodically, especially during periods of stress. Rather than utilizing antifungal creams, angular herpes simplex is treated in the same way as <b>a</b> cold <b>sore,</b> with topical antiviral drugs such as aciclovir.|$|R

5|$|The typical {{symptoms}} of a cold include a cough, a runny nose, nasal congestion and <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> throat, sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite. <b>A</b> <b>sore</b> throat is present in about 40% of cases and a cough in about 50%, while muscle ache occurs in about half. In adults, a fever is generally not present but it is common in infants and young children. The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, {{a great deal of}} similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections.|$|E
5|$|After his service, Wensloff {{returned}} to the New York Yankees for the 1947 season. He made his first appearance {{at the start of}} June and pitched despite having <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> arm throughout the season, pitching infrequently. In 11 games with the Yankees, Wensloff compiled a record of 3–1 with a 2.61 ERA and 18 strikeouts in 51⅔ innings pitched, and pitched two innings of one game in the 1947 World Series.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} five games, the absence of Adrian Peterson did not keep the Sooners from running {{the ball on the}} ground. Allen Patrick returned from missing the last two games with <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> ankle and put up 163yards on 23carries, including a 65-yard touchdown scamper to start the second half. Chris Brown had an additional 19carries for 74yards and two touchdowns as Patrick's backup. At the end of the day, Paul Thompson only threw 11passes, 7completions for 77yards with one touchdown and no interceptions, and Oklahoma had 238yards of rushing.|$|E

The Pirates won the NL East {{that year and}} faced the Reds in the 1972 NLCS. The Pirates pitched Ellis with <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> arm, but the Reds won the series.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclusion}} of significant LGBT characters in modern speculative fiction television series {{has not been}} universal. For example, the Star Trek franchise's lack of same-sex relationships has long been <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> spot with LGBT fandom, {{some of whom have}} organised boycotts against the franchise to protest its failure to include LGBT characters. They also point out that Gene Roddenberry had made statements in later life favourable to acceptance of homosexuality and the portrayal of same-sex relationships in Star Trek, but that the franchise's coverage has remained meagre.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of Kameo release, lead {{designer}} George Andreas felt that the original Kameo concept of finding and using monsters had evolved and carried through to the final product. He {{said that there were}} enough ideas for a sequel within the new intellectual property if players were interested. Years later, Andreas reappraised and said that the game should never have been released and remains <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> subject for him to discuss. Since the project was nearly finished, they had opted for launch title release instead of starting over. Andreas felt that the effort to conceal the fairy Kameo as an elf was unsuccessful and that the character did not match the Xbox's first-person shooter demographic.|$|E

5|$|As he neared his {{eleventh}} birthday, Gloucester {{was assigned}} the rooms in Kensington Palace {{that had been}} used by his aunt, Queen Mary, who died in 1694. At his birthday party at Windsor, on 24 July 1700, he complained of a sudden fatigue, but was initially thought to have overheated himself while dancing. By nightfall, he was suffering from <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> throat and chills, followed by a severe headache and a high fever the next day. A physician, Hannes, did not arrive until 27 July. Gloucester was immediately bled, but his condition continued to deteriorate. Over the next day, he developed a rash and suffered a bout of diarrhoea. A second physician, Gibbons, arrived early on 28 July, followed by Radcliffe that evening.|$|E
5|$|He {{wore the}} #3 jersey for the New York Yankees in 1947, {{and was one}} of the last players to wear it before it was retired in honor of Babe Ruth the {{following}} year. On December 11, 1947, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians for pitcher Red Embree. To begin the 1948 Cleveland Indians season, Clark was in a crowded outfield position battle, with Larry Doby, Thurman Tucker, and Wally Judnich fighting for playing time, but Clark was noted as the most interesting to watch by The Sporting News due to owner Bill Veeck's high regard for him. The only weakness noted in his game was <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> arm from the previous season, to which Clark responded that reading the newspaper was the first time he noticed anything about a bad arm.|$|E
5|$|Holloman {{finished}} the 1953 season with Toronto, {{and had a}} 4–3 record in 13 games. In 1954, Holloman's last professional season, he spent time on five different minor league squads, including former stops Toronto and Augusta, before retiring. The retirement was partially due to <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> arm, the result of pitching too frequently while playing winter ball. After retiring, Holloman became a truck driver and ran an advertising agency, {{and served as a}} scout for the Baltimore Orioles. He also turned to drinking for many years, but was able to overcome the addiction. He died on May 1, 1987 at the age of 64 in Athens, Georgia of a heart attack.|$|E

5|$|Internationally, George {{maintained}} {{a strong relationship}} with his brother-in-law, the Prince of Wales (eventually King Edward VII of the United Kingdom), and sought his help in defusing the recurring and contentious issue of Crete, an overwhelmingly Greek island that remained under Ottoman Turk control. Since the reign of Otto, the Greek desire to unite Greek lands in one nation had been <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> spot with the United Kingdom and France, which had embarrassed Otto by occupying the main Greek port Piraeus to dissuade Greek irredentism during the Crimean War. During the Cretan Revolt (1866–1869), the Prince of Wales sought the support of British Foreign Secretary Lord Derby to intervene in Crete on behalf of Greece. Ultimately, the Great Powers did not intervene and the Ottomans put down the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Overmars {{suffered}} a minor setback prior to Euro 2000 with <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> thigh muscle. However, he resumed training and was declared {{fit for the}} Netherlands opening match against Czech Republic, where he started on the bench. His introduction brought about the only goal of the match – a penalty scored the 89th minute. Ronald de Boer was adjudged to have had his shirt pulled whilst jumping to meet Overmars' cross. In the quarter-finals, he scored twice in the team's 6–1 win against Yugoslavia. The Netherlands went on to lose their semi-final to Italy on penalties. Overmars played in eight of the national team's ten 2002 World Cup qualifiers, {{but it was an}} unsuccessful campaign as they failed to qualify for the finals.|$|E
5|$|The Amstel Gold Race {{is part of}} the UCI World Tour, {{which meant}} that the 17 UCI WorldTeams were {{automatically}} invited and obliged to send a team. The race organisers also made eight wildcard invitations to UCI Professional Continental teams. The peloton was therefore made up of 25 teams. With eight riders on each team, a total of 200 riders were entered. Two of these, 's Dries Devenyns and Thomas Degand, were forced to pull out before the start (Degand with a stomach upset and Devenyns with <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> back), so 198 riders started the race.|$|E

5|$|At mid-season, Zürich {{newspaper}} Sport {{ranked the}} top 15 European players, and listed Cochet first (Borotra second, Brugnon ninth). At that time Cochet {{was struggling with}} a shoulder injury. For the 50th anniversary of the Wiener Park Club of Vienna a tournament was organized with an international line-up. The two biggest contenders Cochet and Roderich Menzel met in the final, Cochet made a comeback from one set down to lift the trophy. He then toured Europe to give exhibitions in Cluj-Napoca, Budapest and Prague. Because of fever and <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> throat Cochet missed the French Championships. He did not recover from his illness before the second Italian International Championships but this did not prevent Cochet from signing up for the competition. With titleholder Tilden having turned professional and Cochet's condition, the championships went easily to George Patrick Hughes. Cochet entered the finals of the doubles too, but his partner André Merlin couldn't make up for Cochet's bad shape and they lost to Alberto Del Bono and singles victor Hughes.|$|E
5|$|Busch stopped {{painting}} in 1896 and signed-over all publication rights to Bassermann Verlag for 50,000 gold marks. Busch, now aged 64, felt old. He needed spectacles for writing and painting, {{and his hands}} trembled slightly. In 1898, together with his aging sister Fanny Nöldeke, he accepted Bassermann's suggestion {{to move into a}} large parsonage in Mechtshausen. Busch read biographies, novels and stories in German, English and French. He organized his works and wrote letters and poems. Most of the poems from the collections Schein und Sein and Zu guter Letzt were written in 1899. The following years were eventless for Busch. He developed <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> throat in early January 1908, and his doctor detected a weak heart. During the night of 8–9 January 1908 Busch slept uneasily, taking camphor, and a few drops of morphine as a tranquilizer. Busch died the following morning before his physician, called by Otto Nöldeke, came to assist.|$|E
5|$|Early {{into his}} fourth {{season with the}} Canucks, Kesler was {{cross-checked}} in the face by Flyers forward Jesse Boulerice. The cross-check was an immediate response to Kesler hitting Flyers defenseman Randy Jones and resulted in Kesler leaving the game with <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> jaw. Boulerice was subsequently suspended for 25 games, matching the then largest suspension in NHL history. Later in the season, Kesler was involved in another violent on-ice incident when Anaheim Ducks defenseman Chris Pronger used his skate blade to stomp on Kesler's calf. Kesler was not injured on the play. Although the NHL originally announced that Pronger would not receive a suspension on the play, he later received an eight-game suspension when new video emerged of the incident. Over {{the course of the}} season, Kesler established himself as a solid two-way center, scoring what was then a career high 21 goals and 37 points and playing a regular shutdown role against opposing teams' top players and on the penalty kill with linemate Alexandre Burrows.|$|E
