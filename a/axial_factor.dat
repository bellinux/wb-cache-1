40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} project is to analyze the behavior of columns made with plain concrete and synthetic polypropylene/polyethylene fiber addition. In order to supplement the current data base, an experimental study was carried out on six columns of real size and ordinary concrete resistance confined by circular stirrups and subjected to constant axial loads and cyclic flexure. Three columns were built with concrete of normal resistance with 0 % of synthetic fibers and three columns were built of concrete with 1 % by volume of synthetic fibers. The used concrete strength varied from 25 to 42 MPa, the resistance of longitudinal steel was 510 MPa, that of the stirrups of 468 and 510 MPa and the <b>axial</b> <b>factor</b> load around 25 % Ag f'c. Today, {{it is possible to}} explore the behavior in the plastic range of the structural elements under seismic loading. Predictions of behaviour of moment vs curvature as well as predictions of force vs displacement relationship were accomplished. Indeed, the comparison between the experimental results and the prediction made for the specimens with and without fibers shows a very good agreement. In the case of the prediction of the moment vs curvature relationship, the MNPHi software developed by [PAULTRE, 1996] was used {{and in the case of}} the prediction of force vs displacement relationship, software DISP 96 developed by [LÉGERON, 1998] was used. Finally, the influence of tie spacement as well as addition of fibers were clearly observed. The results show that the presence of polypropylene/polyethylene fibers in the concrete matrix improves ductility, tenacity, and the capacity to dissipate energy.

50|$|The Betz {{limit is}} defined by the maximum value that can be given by the above formula. This is found by taking the {{derivative}} with respect to the <b>axial</b> induction <b>factor,</b> setting it to zero and solving for the <b>axial</b> induction <b>factor.</b> Betz was able to show that the optimum <b>axial</b> induction <b>factor</b> is one third. The optimum <b>axial</b> induction <b>factor</b> was then used to find the maximum coefficient of power. This maximum coefficient is the Betz limit. Betz was able to show that the maximum coefficient of power of a wind turbine is 16/27. Airflow operating at higher thrust will cause the <b>axial</b> induction <b>factor</b> to rise above the optimum value. Higher thrust cause more air to be deflected away from the turbine. When the <b>axial</b> induction <b>factor</b> falls below the optimum value the wind turbine is not extracting all the energy it can. This reduces pressure around the turbine and allows more air to pass through the turbine, but not enough to account for the lack of energy being extracted.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} weak {{interaction}} <b>axial</b> form <b>factors</b> of the octet baryons, within the covariant spectator quark model, {{focusing on the}} dependence of four-momentum transfer squared, Q^ 2. In our model the <b>axial</b> form <b>factors</b> G_A(Q^ 2) (axial-vector form factor) and G_P(Q^ 2) (induced pseudoscalar form factor), are calculated based on the constituent quark <b>axial</b> form <b>factors</b> and the octet baryon wave functions. The quark axial current is parametrized by the two constituent quark form factors, the axial-vector form factor g_A^q(Q^ 2), and the induced pseudoscalar form factor g_P^q(Q^ 2). The baryon wave functions are composed of a dominant S-state and a P-state mixture for the relative angular momentum of the quarks. First, we study in detail the nucleon case. We assume that the quark axial-vector form factor g_A^q(Q^ 2) has the same function form {{as that of the}} quark electromagnetic isovector form factor. The remaining parameters of the model, the P-state mixture and the Q^ 2 -dependence of g_P^q(Q^ 2), are determined by a fit to the nucleon <b>axial</b> form <b>factor</b> data obtained by lattice QCD simulations with large pion masses. In this lattice QCD regime the meson cloud effects are small, and the physics associated with the valence quarks can be better calibrated. Once the valence quark model is calibrated, we extend the model to the physical regime, and use the low Q^ 2 experimental data to estimate the meson cloud contributions for G_A(Q^ 2) and G_P(Q^ 2). Using the calibrated quark <b>axial</b> form <b>factors,</b> and the generalization of the nucleon wave function for the other octet baryon members, we make predictions for all the possible weak interaction <b>axial</b> form <b>factors</b> G_A(Q^ 2) and G_P(Q^ 2) of the octet baryons. The results are compared with the corresponding experimental data for G_A(0), and with the estimates of baryon-meson models based on SU(6) symmetry.
