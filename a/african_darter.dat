5|$|The {{wide variety}} of birds in Basse Casamance was noted by early explorers. While Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have not been open for years due to the Casamance Conflict, Carabane {{has been found to}} be very conducive to ornithological observation. A study in 1998 {{discovered}} the following species on the island: <b>African</b> <b>darter</b> (Anhinga rufa), Goliath heron (Ardea goliath), palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), blue-spotted wood-dove (Turtur afer), red-eyed dove (Streptopelia semitorquata), white-rumped swift (Apus caffer), woodland kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis), grey-backed camaroptera (Camaroptera brachyura), red-bellied paradise-flycatcher (Terpsiphone rufiventer), pied crow (Corvus albus), black-rumped waxbill (Estrilda troglodytres) and yellow-fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus).|$|E

5000|$|The [...] <b>African</b> <b>darter</b> (Anhinga rufa), {{sometimes}} called the snakebird, is a water bird of sub-Saharan Africa and Iraq.|$|E
50|$|Numerous birds including, storks, small wading birds, waterfowl, eagles {{and even}} small swift-flying birds may be snatched. As a whole, birds are quite {{secondary}} prey, rarely comprising more than 10-15% of crocodile’s diets although are taken fairly evenly across all crocodile size ranges excluding juveniles {{of less than}} 1 m. Birds most often taken are <b>African</b> <b>darters</b> (Anhinga rufa) and reed (Microcarbo africanus) and white-breasted cormorants (Phalacrocorax lucidus), followed by various waterfowl, including most breeding geese and ducks in Africa. Slow-swimming pelicans are also frequently vulnerable to crocodiles. Nile crocodile apparently frequently station themselves underneath breeding colonies of darter and cormorants and presumably snatch up fledgling birds as they drop to the water before they can competently escape the saurian, as has been recorded with several other crocodilians.|$|R
50|$|John Gould {{described}} the Australasian darter as Plotus novaehollandiae in 1847. Closely related to American (Anhinga anhinga), African (Anhinga rufa), and Oriental (Anhinga melanogaster) darters, the Australasian darter has been classed as a subspecies of the African or <b>African</b> plus Oriental <b>darters.</b> All four {{have also been}} classed as a single species. Examination of the leg bones indicates the three Old World species are {{more closely related to}} each other with the American species more divergent. Genetic analysis showed it differed from A. rufa to a degree equivalent to that between other separate species, and shifted consensus to treating the Australasian darter as a separate species.|$|R
50|$|The bird {{sanctuary}} has about 165 species of birds; the lesser and greater flamingos, great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus) and pink-backed pelican (Pelecanus rufescens) {{are the most}} dominant species, they arrive annually in large numbers {{as part of their}} migration during the winter season. Some of the other notable bird species recorded are: avocet, blackwinged stilt (Himantopus himantopus), blacksmith lapwing (Vanellus armatus), black-necked grebe (Podiceps nigricollis), bustards, carmine, <b>darters,</b> <b>African</b> fish eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer), geese, korhaans, pied kingfisher (Ceryle rudis), black-chested snake-eagle (Circaetus pectoralis), blue-cheeked bee-eater (Merops persicus), Cape teal (Anas capensis), kori bustard (Ardeotis kori), Hottentot teal (Anas hottentota), martial eagle (Polemaetus bellicosus), red-knobbed coot, (Fulica cristata), secretarybird (Sagittarius serpentarius), spoonbills, and white-faced whistling duck (Dendrocygna viduata).|$|R
5000|$|Anhinga africana, {{a synonym}} for Anhinga rufa, the <b>African</b> <b>darter</b> or snakebird, a water bird species of {{tropical}} sub-Saharan Africa ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>darter</b> {{is found}} {{throughout}} sub-Saharan Africa wherever large {{bodies of water}} occur; overall the species remains widespread and common.|$|E
50|$|Inevitably {{linked to}} water are also {{pelicans}} and darters. The pink-backed pelican (Pelecanus rufescens) and the <b>African</b> <b>darter</b> (Anhinga rufa) {{live within the}} BBWR.|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>darter</b> is {{a member}} of the darter family, Anhingidae, and is closely related to American (Anhinga anhinga), Oriental (Anhinga melanogaster), and Australasian (Anhinga novaehollandiae) darters.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{many other}} waterbirds the {{feathers}} of the <b>African</b> <b>darter</b> {{do not contain}} any oil and are therefore not waterproof. Because of this, the bird is less positively buoyant and its diving capabilities are enhanced. After diving for fish, the feathers can become waterlogged. In {{order to be able}} to fly and maintain heat insulation, it needs to dry its feathers. Thus the <b>African</b> <b>darter</b> is often seen sitting along the waterside spreading its wings and drying its feathers in the wind and the sun along with cormorants which may share its habitat.|$|E
50|$|The male {{is mainly}} glossy black with white streaking, but females and {{immature}} birds are browner. The <b>African</b> <b>darter</b> differs in appearance from the American darter most recognisably by its thin white lateral neck stripe against a rufous background colour. The pointed bill should prevent confusion with cormorants.|$|E
50|$|He was a {{founding}} member of the Société de géographie de Lyon (1873) and the Société préhistorique française (1904). He was also a member of the Société géologique de France (from 1867) and the Société linnéenne de Lyon (from 1885). In 1882 the <b>African</b> <b>darter</b> subspecies, Anhinga rufa chantrei was named in his honour by ornithologist Émile Oustalet.|$|E
50|$|It was {{feared that}} the Levant darter (Anhinga rufa chantrei), a {{subspecies}} of the <b>African</b> <b>darter,</b> and the maxwelli subspecies of the smooth-coated otter had disappeared entirely, but small and threatened populations remain of both. It is {{feared that the}} Bunn's short-tailed bandicoot rat (Nesokia bunnii, syn. Erythronesokia bunnii), which had only been described from specimens obtained in the Central Marshes, is extinct.|$|E
50|$|Among other fauna, {{the lake}} {{supports}} relatively few invertebrates: There are fifteen species of molluscs, including one endemic, and also an endemic freshwater sponge. Numerous wetland birds, {{such as the}} great white pelican and <b>African</b> <b>darter,</b> reside at Lake Tana. It is an important resting and feeding ground for many Palearctic migrant waterbirds. There are no crocodiles, but the African softshell turtle has been recorded near the Blue Nile outflow from the lake.|$|E
50|$|Lake Amik was an {{extremely}} valuable habitat on the migratory routes of waterfowl and other birds, especially white storks and pelicans, and was noted for an isolated breeding population of the <b>African</b> <b>darter.</b> It also supported populations of endemic birds; a possible distinct subspecies of the black francolin (Francolinus francolinus billypayni) and the similarly distinct southern Turkish bearded reedling (Panurus biarmicus kosswigi). A ray-finned fish species Hemigrammocapoeta caudomaculata was only known from Lake Amik, while the cyprinid Jordan himri was found nowhere else in Turkey.|$|E
50|$|Bird life is {{plentiful}} in Shaba, {{and similar}} to that of the Samburu and Buffalo Springs National Reserves.The near-threatened and poorly known Williams's lark is found in the reserve in regions of rocky lava semi-desert with low Barleria shrubs. It has not been observed in any other protected area.The reserve lies on the migration route from the Palearctic for the globally threatened lesser kestrel, a few of whom pass through each year.Shaba is also home to regionally threatened birds that include the sporadically visiting <b>African</b> <b>darter</b> and great egret and the resident white-headed vulture, martial eagle and yellow-billed oxpecker, the last of which is fairly common.|$|E
50|$|The {{probability}} of long-time isolation from other wetlands {{is suggested by}} a fish endemic to the lake, the Jipe tilapia. Jipe's waters are teeming with big fish, principally siluriforms and cyprinoids. Jipe forms a biodiversity rich ecosystem also known for the water birds that frequent its reedy shores; these include storks, egrets, pelicans, spur-winged plovers, ducks, and Egyptian geese. Lesser jacana and the purple gallinule are common on the lake despite being rare {{in other parts of}} Africa and Madagascar squacco heron, black heron, <b>African</b> <b>darter</b> and African skimmers are often seen. The vicinity of the lake is frequented by herds of game. Hippopotami and crocodiles are plentiful.|$|E

5000|$|The Central Marshes {{stretched}} between Nasiriyah, Al-'Uzair (Ezra's Tomb) and Al-Qurnah {{and were}} mainly {{fed by the}} Tigris and its distributaries (the Shatt al-Muminah and Majar al-Kabir). They were drained by the (partially artificial) Prosperity Canal, and by the Glory River. The Central Marshes were characterised by tall qasab reeds but included a number of freshwater lakes, of which the largest were the Haur az-Zikri and Umm al-Binni (literally [...] "mother of binni", the latter being a species of barbel.) The marshes support breeding populations of the Basra reed-warbler and marbled teal, along with several other species of non-breeding birds. [...] It was feared that the Levant darter (Anhinga rufa chantrei), a subspecies of the <b>African</b> <b>darter,</b> and the maxwelli subspecies of the smooth-coated otter had disappeared entirely, but small and threatened populations remain of both. It is feared that the Bunn's short-tailed bandicoot rat (Nesokia bunnii, syn. Erythronesokia bunnii), which had only been described from specimens obtained in the Central Marshes, is extinct.|$|E
50|$|The marshes {{are home}} to 40 species of bird and several species of fish plus demarcating a range limit {{for a number of}} {{avifauna}} species. The marshes were once home to millions of birds and the stopover for millions of other migratory birds, including flamingos, pelicans and herons as they traveled from Siberia to Africa. At risk are 40% to 60% of the world's marbled teal population that live in the marshes, along with 90% of the world's population of Basra reed-warbler. Also at risk are the sacred ibis and <b>African</b> <b>darter.</b> A subspecies of the hooded crow known as the Mesopotamian crow is found in this part of southern Iraq. Seven species are now extinct from the marshes, including the Indian crested porcupine, the Bunn's short-tailed bandicoot rat and the marsh gray wolf. The draining of the marshes caused a significant decline in bioproductivity; following the Multi-National Force overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime, water flow to the marshes was restored and the ecosystem has begun to recover.|$|E
5000|$|The white-breasted {{cormorant}} is {{the only}} form of great cormorant found in Sub-Saharan Africa, the only form that has strictly freshwater populations and the only form with a white breast and throat; it does however interbreed freely with dark-breasted forms in central Africa. [...] It has a wide distribution; {{on the west coast}} from the Cape Verde Islands to Guinea-Bissau and from Angola to the Cape of Good Hope and northwards on the east coast to Mozambique. It occurs around the entire Southern African coastline, {{but it is not clear}} whether the coastal populations are separate from the inland populations. On the African mainland it occurs more frequently in eastern and southern parts, rather than in the drier western regions, where it usually is found only on perennial rivers and dams. On inland waters it commonly occurs together with the reed cormorant and the <b>African</b> <b>darter,</b> but it is ecologically separated from these species by its fishing habits and the size and nature of its prey. [...] There are also inland populations in Nigeria and around Lake Chad, and in eastern and southern Africa from Sudan southwards. It can be found around the Red Sea, where it is sometimes referred to as the Red Sea white-breasted cormorant.|$|E

40|$|This study {{deals with}} {{disorders}} of sexual development in humans, wildlife and animals {{in an urban}} nature reserve (RNR) and a currently DDT-sprayed malarial area. High levels of oestrogenic chemical residues in water, sediment and tissue; skewed sex ratios; reduced biodiversity; gonadal malformations in sharptooth catfish and freshwater snails; intersex in catfish; and impaired spermatogenesis in catfish and striped mouse are of serious concern in the RNR. Persistent eggshell thinning in <b>African</b> <b>darter</b> eggs, intersex in male Mozambican tilapia, follicular atresia in females and impaired spermatogenesis in males following laboratory exposure of parent fish and impaired spermatogenesis in males following laboratory exposure of parent fish to environmentally relevant DDT and DDE concentrations, and abnormalities in freshwater snails {{were found in the}} DDT-sprayed area. Human studies related to DDT exposure indicated impaired semen quality, a weak association with sperm chromatin defects and higher risks for external urogenital birth defects in those who were born to mothers whose houses were sprayed and those who were homemakers (Stay at home mother) instead of being employed. These findings indicate that disease of sexual development occurred in both human and wildlife populations exposed to environmental endocrine disruptor chemicals in South Africa. The chemical mixtures, possibly related to disorders of sexual differentiation (DSD), were very different between the two. However, DSD occurred concurrently in the malarial area, possibly indicating that humans and wildlife shared exposures. Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of suspecting disease in the other when disease is found in either human or wildlife populations.

40|$|Per- and polyfluoroalkyl {{substances}} (PFASs) are a {{group of}} toxic and persistent organic compounds. Their properties make them extremely resistant {{and they have been}} shown to have bioaccumulation and toxic properties in the environment and also to biomagnify in both aquatic and terrestrial food webs. This study has analysed different PFASs in <b>African</b> <b>Darter</b> (Anhinga rufa) eggs from five sites along Vaal River; Orange River, South Africa. Sixteen of 23 analysed PFASs were detected and quantified, and the homologue profiles were studied from all five sites. Total perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) (all structural isomers) was the predominated compound of all PFASs, accounting for 88 - 98 % for all sites, with a median concentration range of 58 ng/g ww to 2473 ng/g ww. The second highest concentration was found for perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) (1. 9 - 42 ng/g ww), followed by perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) (1. 1 - 14 ng/g ww) and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) (0. 68 - 6. 0 ng/g ww). The results showed significantly that the three up-stream sites (Welverdiend, Schoemansdrift and Orkney East) had similar patterns and that eggs from Schoemansdrift had the highest levels of PFASs. This may indicate the same source of origin for these three sites and that Schoemansdrift are closest to the contamination source. The three sites (Welverdiend, Schoemansdrift and Orkney East) with similar pattern is closest to Gauteng, which can be where the emission source is located, because it is an industrial area. Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and PFOS might originate from different sources and the source for PFCAs could be degradation of fluorotelomer-based precursors. Structural isomer profiles of PFOS showed similar results as the PFAS homologue patterns, which give further indication of the source of origin. The contribution of linear PFOS (L-PFOS) to the total amount of PFOS was between the range of 94 and 97 %. Bloemhof had the highest concentration of branched isomers among all sites. The L-PFOS concentrations in Bloemhof were also significantly differ from Schoemansdrift. This indicate two different sources between Bloemhof and the three up-steam sites, or an effect of environmental fractionation...|$|E
