40|$|There {{are many}} {{opportunities}} to conserve energy within an Industrial Plant without adversely impacting the operation or production. Many of these represent only relatively small savings, {{when compared to the}} overall utility bill; however, one major benefit of energy conservation is that the resultant savings in dollars goes directly to ?the bottom line? as increased profits. To generate the same amount of profit dollars as an effective energy conservation project can generate, in cost avoidance, the plant would have to substantially increase the product shipments. This is not always possible; however, conserving energy is nearly always possible. How should one begin an energy conservation program within a major Industrial Plant?

Introduction: The air {{compressor}} plant tested {{is a part}} of the equipment of the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory at the Kansas State Agricultural College. It consists of a vertical steam engine, an air compressor, an air receiver, and a Westinghouse steam engine used as an air motor. The arrangement of the plant is shown in the accompanying scheme. The vertical steam engine is supposed to develop about ten horse power when running at two hundred fifty recolutions per minute. The diameter of its piston is six inches, and its stroke is eight inches. The diameter of the piston rod is one and one-eighth inches. The engine receives steam from a two and one-half inch pipe, which is connected to the steam main. The steam before reaching the engine passes through a steam separator. The condition of the steam was about. 995. The engine exhausted into the air. The air compressor is of the Ingersoll –Sergeant make. The diameter of its piston is eight inches, and its stroke is eight inches. The diameter of its piston rod is one and three-eighths inches. The compressor is driven by the steam engine with a two ply leather belt. The Westinghouse steam engine which was used as an air motor consists of two vertical, single acting cylinders. The diameter of the pistons are five inches, and their stroke six inches. The cranks are one hundred and eighty degrees apart...|$|E
40|$|The {{quantities}} of positron emitting radionuclides used in medical diagnostics {{and the number}} of radiopharmaceutical production facilities have been estimated to be growing worldwide. In this field, an amount of these radionuclides might become airborne and escape into the environment during the process of production and/or during administration by hospital personnel. Therefore, the analysis of dose to the operating staff {{as well as to the}} public, due to releases through the stack, is a very important issue. To this end, sampling and measurement of radionuclide concentration in air released through the stack of a Nuclear Medicine Center (NMC), provided with a cyclotron for radiopharmaceuticals production, must be routinely carried out with an automatic measurement system. In this work is presented the analysis of the air concentration data recorded in “San Gaetano” NMC at Bagheria (Italy). The contaminated air at stack comes from cyclotron vault during irradiation, from Radiochemistry Laboratories during radiopharmaceuticals synthesis, from diagnostics room during medical scanning and other areas. Sampling of air was carried out continuously and gamma-ray spectrometric measurement are made on-line and for a short time by using a shielded Marinelli beaker filled with sampled air and a gamma detector. The use of this system allows to have 720 values per day from 2002, year of the start of operation with the cyclotron, until 2013. Therefore, the concentration values are very many and an analysis software is needed. The analysis allows either to determine the dose to the population and to evaluate possible improvements in the plant devices to reduce the air concentration at stack. Among engineered safety feature actuation systems, the provision of <b>Air</b> <b>Compressing</b> Stations (ACS), used for both hot cells and cyclotron vault releases, and a change in the position and height of the stack allow to ensure low level discharges from the stack and to reduce the dose to reference group of population.

40|$|A new cooling {{approach}} with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> {{has been developed}} in order to cool the cutting tool edge during turning of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy. The cutting forces, chip morphology and chip temperature were measured and compared with those measured during machining with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling and dry cutting conditions. The chip temperature is lower with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling than those with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling and dry machining. The combined effects of reduced friction and chip bending away from the cutting zone {{as a result of}} the high-speed air produce a thinner chip with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling and a thicker chip with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling compared to dry machining alone. The marginally higher cutting force associated with the application of cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> compared with dry machining is the result of lower chip temperatures and a higher shear plane angle. The tendency to form a segmented chip is higher when machining with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> than that with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> and dry machining only within the ranges of cutting speed and feed when chip transitions from continuous to the segmented. The effect of cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> on the cutting force and chip formation diminishes with increase in cutting speed and feed rate. The application of both <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> and cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> reduced flank wear and the tendency to form the chip built-up edge.

40|$|Air {{compressors}} are {{a significant}} industrial energy user. Based on a survey (conducted by Oregon State University and the Bonneville Power Administration) of energy audit reports from 125 plants, air compressors account for roughly 10 % of total plant energy use. Furthermore, air compression is inefficient with up to 95 % of compressor power dissipated as heat. Thus even minor improvements in system operation, control strategies, and efficiency can yield large energy savings and significant non-energy or productivity benefits from reliable <b>compressed</b> <b>air.</b> <b>Compressed</b> <b>air</b> is often called the ""fourth utility"" in industrial facilities after electricity, natural gas, and water. It provides motive power for machinery, cooling, materials handling, and hand tools. It is a safe, flexible, and powerful resource, but one that is seldom run for low operating costs or best productivity. Learning the basics of <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> systems represents the beginning of both reducing energy costs and enjoying the productive benefits of reliable <b>compressed</b> <b>air.</b> <b>Compressed</b> <b>air</b> management systems, including a system approach to managing demand, stabilizing pressure, reducing leaks and compressor controls, can allow the industrial end user to save 20 % - 50 % of their air compressor electricity usage. The monitoring capabilities of <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> management systems provide a useful tool through power, pressure and flow trending to maintain both the energy savings and increased system reliability. More efficiently managed <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> systems are less costly to maintain and have less impact on the environment.
