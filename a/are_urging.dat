25|$|Supporters of {{the film}} tax credit in Rhode Island <b>are</b> <b>urging</b> state {{officials}} to maintain the program, pointing to a study showing the program created more than 4,000 jobs in the state between 2006–2009. Critics of the program say the ubiquity of incentives in most states have diminished Rhode Island's competitive advantage and that the funds would be better spent elsewhere.|$|E

Small improvements in technology applied to such a huge resource could mean enormous additions to Canada's recoverable crude oil reserves.|$|E

2500|$|The general {{population}} of healthy adults {{is not at}} risk for potential adverse effects from caffeine if they limit their consumption to 400mg per day, which {{is the equivalent of}} 5 standard cans, with one can being 250ml in volume. Consumption of a single energy drink will not lead to excessive caffeine intake. Adverse effects associated with caffeine consumption in amounts greater than 400mg include nervousness, irritability, sleeplessness, increased urination, abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmia), and dyspepsia. Consumption also has been known to cause pupil dilation when taken with certain antidepressants or SSRIs. [...] Caffeine dosage is not required to be on the product label for food in the United States, unlike drugs, but some advocates <b>are</b> <b>urging</b> the FDA to change this practice.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2011, {{the locks}} were again closed, this time {{owing to the}} {{excessive}} corrosion of the locks' gate anchors. The further deterioration of the locks resulted in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reclassifying the locks as being in a [...] "non-operational status," [...] out of concern that any further operation of the locks {{could lead to a}} failure of the locks, posing a safety risk. The locks are expected to remain permanently closed, as the lack of traffic through the locks makes funding for any repairs a low priority. [...] However, some interest groups <b>are</b> <b>urging</b> the Army Corps of Engineers to reopen the locks, at least seasonally, and the Clackamas County Board of Commissioners added its support to that effort in December 2014.|$|E
2500|$|For example, when Edward and Richard <b>are</b> <b>urging</b> York {{to break}} his oath to Henry, Edward says, [...] "But for a kingdom, any oath may be broken;/I would break a {{thousand}} oaths to reign one year" [...] (1.2.16–17), thus showing the attraction that power has for the characters, and what {{they would be willing}} to do to attain it. Later, echoing Warwick's statement about his reasons for joining the Lancastrians, Richard outlines why he has remained loyal to the Yorkists; [...] "I stay not for the love of Edward but the crown" [...] (4.1.125), again showing the attraction of power and the subversion of all other concerns, including familial relations. Another example is when Prince Edward is killed in Act 5, Scene 5. His death is brought about because he taunts the Plantagenet brothers, and they lose their temper with him, not because they are exacting revenge for an ongoing feud with his family. Similarly, when Richard kills Henry, his motives have nothing to do with the conflict between his family and Henry's. He murders him simply because Henry stands in the way of his attempts to gain the throne. As Michael Hattaway writes, [...] "family loyalties may have been the initial cause of the feuds, but an audience watching 3 Henry VI is likely to feel that individual ambition rather than family honour is what fuels the vendettas that inform the play. Both [...] seem to have forgotten that the quarrel between [...] originally was a dynastic one: their claims to legitimacy and authority in this play are now validated only by the forces they can muster" [...] As Jane Howell, director of the BBC Shakespeare adaptation argues, [...] "anarchy is loosed and you're left with a very different set of values – every man for himself. You're into a time of change in which there is no code except survival of the fittest – who happens to be Richard." ...|$|E

Why, just before I came away from Manila I saw a dozen or more Igorottes brought in--tall, strapping fellows, but as ignorant as so many children. They seemed to be dazed when their wounds were cared for and they were offered food. The interpreter said they thought they would be massacred on the spot by the bloodthirsty Americanos, and they had a lurking suspicion that they were being cared for just so they could be sold into slavery." ...|$|E
6000|$|Of old, the Seymour {{family had}} always been a bulwark {{on the side of a}} {{temperate}} self-restraint and reticence in worldly indulgence; of a kind that parents find most useful to strengthen their hands when children <b>are</b> <b>urging</b> them on to expenses beyond their means: for they could say, [...] "The Seymours are richer than we are, and you see they don't change their carpets, nor get new sofas, nor give extravagant parties; and they give simple, reasonable, quiet entertainments, and do not go into any modern follies." [...] So the Seymours kept up the Fergusons, and the Fergusons the Seymours; and the Wilcoxes and the Lennoxes encouraged each other in a style of quiet, reasonable living, saving money for charity, and time for reading and self-cultivation, and by moderation and simplicity keeping up the courage of less wealthy neighbors to hold their own with them.|$|E
60|$|If {{there is}} {{divergence}} between us {{in regard to}} the methods by which we are to raise our revenue, there is also divergence {{in regard to the}} objects on which we are to spend them. We are, on both sides, inclined to agree that we are approaching, if we have not actually entered on, one of the climacterics of our national life. We see new forces at work in the world, and they are not all friendly forces. We see new conditions abroad and around us, and they are not all favourable conditions; and I think {{there is a great deal}} to be said for those who on both sides of politics <b>are</b> <b>urging</b> that we should strive for a more earnest, more strenuous, more consciously national life. But there we part, because the Conservative Party are inclined too much to repose their faith for the future security and pre-eminence of this country upon naval and military preparations, and would sometimes have us believe that you can make this country secure and respected by the mere multiplication of ironclad ships. We shall not exclude that provision, and now indeed ask the Committee to enable us to take the steps to secure us that expansion of revenue which will place our financial resources beyond the capacity of any Power that we need to take into consideration. But we take a broader view. We are not going to measure the strength of great countries only by their material resources. We think that the supremacy and predominance of our country depend upon the maintenance of the vigour and health of its population, just as its true glory must always be found in the happiness of its cottage homes. We believe that if Great Britain is to remain great and famous in the world, we cannot allow the present social and industrial disorders, with their profound physical and moral reactions, to continue unchecked. We propose to you a financial scheme, but we also advance a policy of social organisation. It will demand sacrifices from all classes; it will give security to all classes. By its means we shall be able definitely to control some of the most wasteful processes in our social life, and without it our country will remain exposed to vital dangers, against which fleets and armies are of no avail.|$|E
