5|$|The communists' {{principal}} rivals {{were the}} veterans of the Armia Krajowa movement, Mikołajczyk's Polish People's (Peasant) Party (Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe; PSL), and {{the veterans of}} the Polish armies which had fought in the West. Of particular practical importance was Mikołajczyk's People's Party, because it was legally recognized by the communists and thus able to function within the political arena. The People's Party wanted to prevent the communists from monopolizing power and eventually establish a parliamentary polity with <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> by winning the promised elections. Mikołajczyk hoped that an independent Polish state, friendly with the Soviet Union, {{would be allowed to}} act as a bridge between the east and the west.|$|E
5|$|In December 2000, the IMF stopped aid {{disbursements}} due {{to corruption}} concerns, and many individual donors followed suit, {{resulting in an}} almost 80% drop in Malawi's development budget. However, in 2005, Malawi was the recipient of over US$575million in aid. The Malawian government faces challenges in developing <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy,</b> improving environmental protection, dealing with the rapidly growing HIV/AIDS problem, improving the education system, and satisfying its foreign donors that it is working to become financially independent. Improved financial discipline had been seen since 2005 {{under the leadership of}} President Mutharika and Financial Minister Gondwe. This discipline has since evaporated as shown by the purchase in 2009 of a private presidential jet followed almost immediately by a nationwide fuel shortage which was officially blamed on logistical problems, but was more likely due to the hard currency shortage caused by the jet purchase. The overall cost to the economy (and healthcare system) is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Ryzhkov's Plan and The 500 Days Programme were broadly similar, {{with both}} {{supporting}} price liberalisation, decentralisation and privatisation. The main {{difference between the}} two was Ryzhkov's desire to retain much of the social security system, free education for all and the continuance of a strong central government apparatus. The 500 Days Programme did not mention political union with the other Soviet republics, but instead weakened the authority of the central government by establishing <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy.</b> In other words, they left the question of continuing or dissolving the Soviet Union open. On 17 September in a meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev openly supported the 500 Days Programme, claiming it would not lead to the reestablishment of capitalism, but instead to a mixed economy where private enterprise played an important role.|$|E

5|$|The English {{economy was}} {{fundamentally}} agricultural, depending on growing {{crops such as}} wheat, barley and oats on an open field system, and husbanding sheep, cattle and pigs. In the late Anglo-Saxon period many peasants moved away from living in isolated hamlets and instead came together to form larger villages engaged in arable cultivation. Agricultural land became typically organised around manors, and was divided between some fields that the landowner would manage directly, called demesne land, {{and the majority of}} the fields that would be cultivated by local peasants. These peasants would pay rent to the landowner either through agricultural labour on the lord's demesne fields or through rent in the form of cash and produce. By the 11th century, <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> was flourishing across much of England, while the eastern and southern towns were heavily involved in international trade. Around 6,000 watermills were built to grind flour, freeing up labour for other more productive agricultural tasks.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand is a {{developed}} country and ranks highly in international comparisons of national performance, such as health, education, economic freedom {{and quality of}} life. Since the 1980s, New Zealand has transformed from an agrarian, regulated economy to <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy.</b> Nationally, legislative authority is vested in an elected, unicameral Parliament, while executive political power is exercised by the Cabinet, led by the Prime Minister, who is currently Jacinda Ardern. Queen Elizabeth II is the country's head of state and is represented by a governor-general, currently Dame Patsy Reddy. In addition, New Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes. The Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau (a dependent territory); the Cook Islands and Niue (self-governing states in free association with New Zealand); and the Ross Dependency, which is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica. New Zealand {{is a member of}} the United Nations, Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Pacific Islands Forum, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the Russian car market {{expanded}} dramatically, {{largely due to}} a drastic cut on import duties, so that by 1993 foreign-made imported cars made up 49% of all sales.

25|$|State run {{enterprises}} in socialist countries {{had little or}} no interest in producing what customers wanted which resulted in shortages of goods and services.

25|$|Officially, the Soviet Union had {{replaced}} the irrationality and wastefulness of <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> with a planned economy organised along a long-term, precise, and scientific framework; in reality, Soviet economics were based on ad hoc commandments issued from the centre, often to make short-term targets.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{whether the}} financial crisis has affected citizens’ confidence in the free <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> and whether it has triggered citizens’ demand for <b>a</b> free <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> with stronger state regulations. Using panel data, the paper confirms that citizens’ confidence levels in the free <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> have decreased {{in most of the}} largest economies and demand for <b>a</b> free <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> with stronger state regulation has increased {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic. After analysing the determinants for citizens’ confidence in the free <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> and demand for <b>a</b> free <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> with stronger state regulation before and after {{the financial crisis}}, the author concludes that citizens’ net confidence loss in the free <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> seems to have been driven by rising unemployment rates, and citizens’ demand for stronger state regulation seems to have been driven by the real economic downturn in GDP growth...|$|R
25|$|Prices and {{quantities}} {{have been}} described as the most directly observable attributes of goods produced and exchanged in <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy.</b> The theory of supply and demand is an organizing principle for explaining how prices coordinate the amounts produced and consumed.
