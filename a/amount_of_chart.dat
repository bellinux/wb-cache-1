The album was recorded in various recording studios within London, New York and Los Angeles. It was mastered at Greenwood Studios. The model who appears on the front cover is Claudia Vass.

Reducing the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>charting</b> through the reduction in frequency of head-to-toe assessments allows more time for direct care. Additional time for hands on patient care can increase nurse satisfaction. Purpose: The purpose of this pilot {{study was to examine}} care provider satisfaction pre- and post-protocol change. Methods: Student designed surveys were developed for this study and sent to care providers on the pediatric unit 2 weeks prior to the protocol change and again 6 weeks following implementation. Results: Nurses reported that the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> time spent <b>charting</b> took away from hands on patient care prior to the change. In an analysis of post-test results, nurses reported that the protocol change allowed them {{to spend more time with}} patients delivering direct, hands-on care.

Discussion: Overall, the protocol change yielded positive results for nurses; however, this research needs to be repeated in a hospital with a larger sample size. While data analysis of research indicates an increase satisfaction amongst nurses post-implementation, provider data was insufficient to analyze...|$|R

We systematically study the hierarchical structures of chart images, and define 4 levels of ground truth to be recorded. To make synthetic images more helpful in training and testing, we design our own parameterized image degradation model which simulates some commonly seen realworld image defect types. By applying such degradation model, synthesized noise-free images can be further degraded with precise controls.

The following chapter is devoted to a detailed background research of actual renewable energy utilization in all twenty seven member states of the European Union. The countries are ranked by their dates of accession to the Union in ascending order, in each chapter alphabetically.

The chapter named Potential of renewable energy utilization in the EU offers an insight into the assumed future utilization of renewable resources up to the year 2020. This chapter draws from so-called National renewable energy action plans (NREAP) in which each member state presents its plan leading to higher renewable sources utilization in the near future. The reader is therefore able to familiarize with plans concerning renewable sources in each member state.

40|$|Objectives Hospital {{board members}} {{are asked to}} {{consider}} large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> quality and safety data with a duty to act on signals of poor performance. However, {{in order to do}} so it is necessary to distinguish signals from noise (chance). This article investigates whether data in English National Health Service (NHS) acute care hospital board papers are presented in a way that helps board members consider the role of chance in their decisions. Methods Thirty English NHS trusts were selected at random and their board papers retrieved. Charts depicting quality and safety were identified. Categorical discriminations were then performed to document the methods used to present quality and safety data in board papers, with particular attention given to whether and how the charts depicted the role of chance, that is, by including control lines or error bars. Results Thirty board papers, containing a total <b>of</b> 1488 <b>charts,</b> were sampled. Only 88 (6 %) <b>of</b> these <b>charts</b> depicted the role of chance, and only 17 of the 30 board papers included any charts depicting the role of chance. <b>Of</b> the 88 <b>charts</b> that attempted to represent the role of chance, 16 included error bars and 72 included control lines. Only 6 (8 %) of the 72 control charts indicated where the control lines had been set (eg, 2 vs 3 SDs).
