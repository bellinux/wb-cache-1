40|$|The Camino de Santiago is a Christian pilgrimage in {{the north}} of Spain leading to the city of Santiago de Compostela. For almost 1000 years pilgrims have walked {{hundreds}} of kilometers in the attempt to reach Santiago. Since the 19802 ̆ 7 s, there has been a resurgence of interest in the Camino, causing it to enjoy popularity unequaled since the Middle Ages. It has captured worldwide attention mainly due to the government 2 ̆ 7 s efforts to establish the north of Spain as a tourist attraction. Now, in addition to the thousands of pilgrims on foot or bike, there are millions of tourists who <b>arrive</b> <b>in</b> <b>Santiago</b> by charter bus or car. Surrounded by tourists, many pilgrims become obsessed with defining the authenticity of their journey and its difference from the tourist experiences. Using ethnographic methods of research, I walked 750 km of the Camino, followed by four weeks in Santiago de Compostela. I talked to locals and pilgrims about the convergence and divergence of tourism and pilgrimage and the need to define travel as authentic or inauthentic. I found that the investment in defining authenticity is directly correlated to a growth of government promotion of the Camino. As government promotion has increased, so has the number of people along the Camino and its integration into the mainstream of tourist destinations in Spain and Europe in general. As a result, its appeal is threatened because it relies on its status as markedly non-mainstream. I assert that the anthropological issue at stake is not what makes a pilgrim authentic or inauthentic, but why the authenticity of each pilgrim is so highly debatable...|$|E

50|$|The Way {{can take}} {{one of dozens of}} pilgrimage routes to Santiago de Compostela. Traditionally, as with most pilgrimages, the Way of Saint James began at one's home and ended at the pilgrimage site. However, a few of the routes are {{considered}} main ones.

By the 1980s, only a few pilgrims per year <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>Santiago.</b> Later, the route attracted a growing number of modern-day pilgrims from around the globe.

5000|$|The compostela is a {{certificate}} of accomplishment given to pilgrims on completing the Way. To earn the compostela one needs to walk a minimum of 100 km or cycle at least 200 km.

25|$|The {{feeling that}} the early 20th century was an era of {{economic}} growth due to technological advances contrasted dramatically with {{the standard of living}} of lower social classes. The growth of the previous decades led to an unprecedented population explosion starting in 1929. The Great Depression caused the collapse of the nitrate industry in the north, leaving 60,000 unemployed, which added to the decline in agricultural exports, resulting in a total number for the unemployed to be about 300,000 nationwide. These unemployed workers saw Santiago and its booming industry as the only chance to survive. Many migrants <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>Santiago</b> with nothing and thousands had to survive on the streets due to the great difficulty in finding a place they could rent. Widespread disease, including tuberculosis, claimed the lives of hundreds of the homeless.

5|$|Montejo {{travelled}} overland from Mexico {{with his}} considerable expedition, which included soldiers, Mexican auxiliaries, provisions and livestock; {{he sent a}} smaller detachment by sea, with additional supplies {{as well as his}} family and household. He <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>Santiago</b> de Guatemala early in 1537, where he purchased more provisions, arms, and livestock, and recruited more soldiers. The new provisions included cattle, sheep and pigs, crossbows, arquebuses, and gunpowder. He now had between 80 and 100 Spanish soldiers, including veterans of Yucatán. He <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> Gracias a Dios towards the end of March 1537, while Cáceres was still in the Comayagua valley. The seaborne detachment fared less well; after resupplying in Cuba, it was plundered by pirates with little loss of life, but most of the provisions were taken. With what could be salvaged, they put into Puerto de Caballos in the spring of 1537, where there were met by Montejo. The strong combined Spanish force now in Honduras-Higueras placed Montejo in a solid position, both militarily and politically. Montejo was installed as governor without opposition on 24 March at Gracias a Dios. He released the imprisoned members of the former town council, and sought their support for continued conquest.|$|R

But what was most important was that the colony developed as an urbanized society that primarily supported the Spanish colonial empire. By the mid-18th century, its colonists held 50,000 slaves, compared to 60,000 in Barbados; 300,000 in Virginia, both British colonies; and 450,000 in French Saint-Domingue, which had large-scale sugar cane plantations.|$|R

5|$|In Higueras, Cerezeda became ill, and {{lacked the}} ability to provide strong leadership. He was unable to expand the conquered area, and the Spanish treated the {{indigenous}} population with customary harshness, resulting in population decline as the natives either succumbed to their ruthless treatment, or fled into the hills. The natives that remained were increasingly hostile, and refuse to work for their encomendero overlords. This resistance crystallised around Sicumba; ever more indigenous warriors rallied to his cause, and areas that had been superficially conquered rose up in arms against the Spanish. Areas that had previously fallen to the Spanish were lost, and they were encircled in a small region centred on Buena Esperanza. The colonists were demoralised, fearing a massive Indian attack at any moment, and were desperately short of provisions since the encomienda towns refused to supply them. The colonists openly questioned Cerezeda's leadership, and new factions formed, with treasurer Diego García de Solís leading the opposition. Rumours of the riches of Peru lured Spaniards away from the faltering colony in Honduras-Higueras, and forty or fifty men deserted in search of better fortune elsewhere. Although precious metals had been discovered close to Buena Esperanza, {{it was impossible to}} mine them due to the hostility of the Indians. In spite of Cerezeda's opposition, García de Solís appealed directly to the governor of Guatemala, Pedro de Alvarado, who had recently returned from Ecuador. Such was the desperate situation that García de Solís travelled personally to Guatemala with ten soldiers, leaving Buena Esperanza in October 1535, and <b>arriving</b> <b>in</b> <b>Santiago</b> de Guatemala <b>in</b> late November.|$|R

After a few years she {{returned}} to the US briefly before moving south again -this time to Brazil where she met Leonora Armstrong and reviewed the translation Armstrong had contracted. Starting in 1946, following World War II, Shoghi Effendi drew up plans for the American (US and Canada) Bahá'í community to send pioneers to Europe including Spain; the Bahá'ís set up a European Teaching Committee chaired by Edna True. Orbison was the first pioneer under the European Committee to reach Spain in January 1947. The second pioneer to Spain was Eduardo Gonzales in June 1947 and stayed until March 1948. Orbison describes conditions early on - [...] "You had to know someone well before you'd dare mention the Faith." [...] Nevertheless, a young bank employee had carried on correspondence about Esperanto with a friend of Orbison's in the United States {{and they were able to}} meet and discuss the religion. Orbison mentioned that a universal auxiliary language was a Bahá'í teaching. He and a friend returned the next day and both soon joined the religion. Other early contacts were afraid to be associated with the religion. By June 1947 there is mention of the first two converts. In 1948 the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly of Madrid was formed. Dorothy Beecher Baker, a prominent Bahá'í and member of the Committee, visited the Bahá'ís in Spain among other European countries in 1948 and again in 1951 when she was appointed as a Hand of the Cause. By June 1949 there were two assemblies in Spain when Orbison, Marion Little, and a Spaniard Bahá'í traveled to Barcelona to meet Bahá'ís there.
