5|$|A large temple also owned sizable {{tracts of}} land and {{employed}} thousands of laymen to supply its needs. Temples were therefore key economic as well as religious centers. The priests who managed these powerful institutions wielded considerable influence, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> their ostensible subordination to the king they may have posed significant challenges to his authority.|$|E
5|$|After 1147, {{however, the}} {{relations}} between the two leaders became friendlier. By 1148 Manuel had seen the wisdom of securing an alliance with Conrad, whose sister-in-law Bertha of Sulzbach he had earlier married; he actually persuaded the German king to renew their alliance against Roger II of Sicily. Unfortunately for the Byzantine emperor, Conrad died in 1152, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> repeated attempts, Manuel could not reach an agreement with his successor, Frederick I Barbarossa.|$|E

5|$|After initial assessments, the HUSAR team {{felt they}} had the proper {{equipment}} for the mission.

5|$|After {{operating}} {{for more}} than twenty years, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> having advertised future events at the club, the business closed abruptly on February 20, 2014. Its website and social media pages were shut down immediately, and a sign was posted at the club noting that Concept Entertainment had decided to sell. The space that Gypsy had occupied was immediately available for long-term lease, with furniture included.|$|E
5|$|Although Arsenal {{had been}} {{fighting}} relegation in both the two previous seasons, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> the chairman's restriction on spending, Chapman nevertheless moved to Arsenal soon afterwards, attracted both by the London club's larger crowds and a salary of £2,000, double what he earned at Huddersfield Town. At Arsenal, Chapman immediately made an impact by signing 34-year-old Charlie Buchan, an England international and Sunderland's all-time record goalscorer, whom he made Arsenal captain.|$|E

5|$|Among the escapees was Henri Giraud, a French General who had {{commanded}} a division in 1940, who escaped from Königstein prison <b>and,</b> <b>despite</b> his pro-Vichy sympathies, joined the Free French in 1943.

5|$|During closing arguments, {{defense counsel}} John Pope {{attempted}} to discredit Darby; the latter reacted by assaulting one of Pope's co-counselors with a cane. The trial lasted thirteen days, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> {{the absence of}} any physical evidence, including a murder weapon, the jury returned a guilty verdict after only an hour of deliberation on May 19. Beauchamp was sentenced to be executed by hanging on June 16, 1826.|$|E

Following the game Jim Boeheim unleashed a passionate profanity laced defense of his star player to the attending media.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, the French dangerously underestimated Austrian {{tenacity}} {{and military}} skill. The white coats, as the French called the Austrians, were far better soldiers than the French assumed, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> such demonstrations as that at Ostrach, Stockach and Winterthur, the French {{continued to hold}} this prejudice. This did not change until 1809 when the Battle of Aspern-Essling and the Battle of Wagram {{a few weeks later}} caused Napoleon to revise his opinion of the Austrian military.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to Rome and was consul {{for a second}} time in 7BC, and in 6BC was granted tribunician power (tribunicia potestas) and control in the East, all of which mirrored positions that Agrippa had previously held.

5|$|He signed seven {{players in}} {{preparation}} for the 2013–14 season, and further strengthened by signing striker François Zoko in September. However Stevenage never recovered from a poor start to the season, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> a late run of six undefeated games ended the campaign in last-place and were therefore relegated into League Two, finishing eight points shy of safety. Westley responded by releasing nine players, whilst a further four were sold on.|$|E
