5|$|The forearms {{are dark}} gray. The forefeet are unpigmented and ungual tufts of white hairs {{surround}} the equally unpigmented claws. The animal has long, narrow hindfeet, longer than in T.talamancae, with usually smooth soles (lacking squamae, which <b>are</b> <b>present</b> in T.talamancae). The three middle digits are {{much longer than}} the outer two. Six pads <b>are</b> <b>present</b> on the sole. The upper surface and {{the sides of the}} hindfeet are white and appear naked, although short, white hairs are present; these hairs are longer in T.talamancae. Ungual tufts of long, white or gray hairs <b>are</b> <b>present</b> around the claws, which are short and lack pigment.|$|E

5|$|Agaricus hondensis {{mushrooms}} are toxic, and consuming the fruit bodies causes gastroenteritis. Some fruit bodies smell of creosote, an odor that {{becomes even more}} prevalent if the {{mushrooms are}} cooked. Cooking also introduces an unpleasant soapy-metallic flavor. The fruit bodies are used as food by the vagrant shrew (Sorex vagrans) and the American shrew mole (Neurotrichus gibbsii). Relatively high levels of the chemical hydroquinone <b>are</b> <b>present</b> in fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} stable isotopes, {{which make up}} almost all lead that exists naturally, there are trace {{quantities}} of a few radioactive isotopes. One of them is lead-210; although it has a half-life of only 22.3 years, small quantities occur in nature because lead-210 is produced by a long decay series that starts with uranium-238 (which has been present for billions of years on Earth). Lead-211, -212, and -214 <b>are</b> <b>present</b> in the decay chains of uranium-235, thorium-232, and uranium-238, respectively, so traces of {{all three of these}} lead isotopes are found naturally. Minute traces of lead-209 arise from the very rare cluster decay of radium-223, one of the daughter products of natural uranium-235. Lead-210 is particularly useful for helping to identify the ages of samples by measuring its ratio to lead-206 (both isotopes <b>are</b> <b>present</b> in a single decay chain).|$|E
