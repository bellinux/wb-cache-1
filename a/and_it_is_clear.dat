5|$|The {{evidence}} of toponymy and language is unequivocal. Placenames in Orkney with a Celtic derivation are {{few in number}} <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> that Norn, a local version of Old Norse, was widely spoken by the inhabitants into historic times. Norn was also spoken in Shetland and evidence for Pictish elements in placenames is virtually non-existent, the three island names of Fetlar, Unst and Yell excepted.|$|E
5|$|These powers {{included}} {{the ability to}} both restrict tribal powers or to relax such restrictions. Congress has done both, {{such as in the}} withdrawal of federal recognition of the Menominee tribe with the Menominee Termination Act in 1954, and the Menominee Restoration Act to restore tribal recognition and powers. The earlier decisions in Duro, Wheeler, and Oliphant dealt with cases where Congress had restricted a tribe's inherent powers but pointed at nothing in the Constitution or established precedent that prohibits Congress from relaxing such restrictions. The decision in Duro was one of federal common law, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> that Congress has the power to change that law. Since the power exercised by the Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe was that of inherent tribal sovereignty, double jeopardy did not attach.|$|E

5|$|By 1924, {{there was}} {{distinct}} pressure on {{space in the}} halls of residence, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> that more rooms were needed. The existing halls were full and so South Stoneham and South Hill were extended by covering their outbuildings.|$|R
50|$|Construction went slowly. By the {{tentative}} 1968 opening date, very little had <b>been</b> started, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> that Interama {{needed to be}} replanned.

25|$|Rognvald's life occurs {{within the}} first eight short {{chapters}} within the Orkneyinga saga <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> that in this early period it contains generally less detail and historical accuracy than in the later events it describes. Recorded in the 13th century, the sagas are informed by Norwegian politics of the day.|$|E
50|$|What {{would become}} Craig Air Force Base was {{established}} before World War II {{to accommodate the}} growing number of pilot trainees.

50|$|Four years later, {{at the age}} of 18, Lodeiro {{made his}} debut for the Nacional first team against Fénix on 19 August 2007. Later on in the year he also scored his first senior goal <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> to see that in Lodeiro, there was a new star in the making.|$|R
50|$|He looked serene. I {{raised his}} eyelids <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> from his pupils {{that he had}} a massive brain injury.

25|$|Over {{the entire}} period, support {{averaged}} about 39%. Opposition to Court packing {{ranged from a}} low of 41% on 24 March to a high of 49% on 3 March. On average, about 46% of each sample indicated opposition to President Roosevelt's proposed legislation. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> that, after a surge from an early push by FDR, the public support for restructuring the Court rapidly melted.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the early}} 18th century, {{virtually}} all European small craft and many larger vessels were built without formal plans being drawn. Shipwrights would construct models to show prospective customers how the full size ship would appear and to illustrate advanced building techniques. These were also useful for marine artists, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> that from Dutch Golden Age Painting onwards {{extensive use of}} models was made by artists.|$|E

There are some further shorthands usually used. The last example is usually written 8*3:2 0, where the ones are omitted and kept the number of dots excepting the dots at the end. For an algebraic knot such as in the first example, 1* is often omitted.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} {{construction}} {{started on the}} main line of the Arth-Rigi Railway, construction had also started on the Gotthard railway, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> that this main line railway would include a station in Arth, now known as Arth-Goldau station. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> clearly important that the Arth-Rigi line should connect with this station.|$|R

25|$|Congenital {{genetic disease}} is well {{understood}} <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> that epigenetics {{can play a}} role, for example, {{in the case of}} Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome. These are normal genetic diseases caused by gene deletions or inactivation of the genes, but are unusually common because individuals are essentially hemizygous because of genomic imprinting, and therefore a single gene knock out is sufficient to cause the disease, where most cases would require both copies to be knocked out.|$|E
25|$|The Hebrew name 'Raphael' means 'God has healed'. The {{archangel}} Raphael {{has traditionally}} been linked with healing and restoration, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> that Franckenberg, in subtitling his manuscript Arzt-Engel ('doctor-angel', a play on Erzengel, 'archangel'), is aware of this fact and wishes {{to make it clear}} to his readers. The work, ostensibly a medical tract, draws on both Paracelsian alchemy and Böhmian mysticism. There is also evidence pointing to Franckenberg's interest in the Kabbalah and of links with Rosicrucianism and the ideas of Joachim of Fiore.|$|E
25|$|Much of Magnétophone's {{music from}} the early singles to the first LP is notable for its 'challenging' nature (the pounding, broken, {{distorted}} beats and unrecognisable bass textures of 'I Hear Blonde Falcons' being a case-in-point), <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> that the band at this stage were often concerned with creating original audio 'objects' that have questionable worth outside of pure abstract appreciation; other tracks from this time more clearly reference rock'n'roll's more simple appeal, and the balancing of these two ethics across a record creates a unique and unsettling audio and emotional experience.|$|E

50|$|Oxipurinol (INN, or oxypurinol USAN) is an {{inhibitor}} of xanthine oxidase. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> {{an active}} metabolite of allopurinol <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>cleared</b> renally. In cases of renal disease, this metabolite will accumulate to toxic levels. By inhibiting xanthine oxidase, it reduces uric acid production.

His first attempt at a literary career came in 1867, when a didactic historical verse drama was rejected. His next venture into the theatre {{did not take place}} until 1892.|$|R
25|$|Amram Gaon in his {{edition of}} the Siddur calls the custom of reciting the Kol Nidre a foolish one ("minhag shetut"). According to others however, it was {{customary}} to recite the formula in various lands of the Jewish dispersion, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> likewise from Amram's Siddur that the usage was widespread as early as his time (9th century) in Spain. But the geonic practice of not reciting the Kol Nidre was long prevalent; {{it has never been}} adopted in the Catalan or in the Algerian ritual, nor in the French regions of Carpentras or Avignon.|$|E
25|$|Unintentional small jumps are {{ubiquitous}} to billiards. In most billiards shots, a player's cue {{is slightly}} elevated. Whenever a ball is struck with an elevated cue, a jump, {{no matter how}} slight, occurs. An oft-used way to illustrate this principle is to lay a coin on the table approximately an inch {{in front of the}} cue ball. When shot very softly, the player will audibly hear the coin being struck and see the cue ball's reaction to that collision. When the same shot is performed with any degree of speed no sound or collision is evident, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> that the coin is being jumped.|$|E
25|$|Amos Jacob is a Jewish physician, intelligence-agent and naturalist {{who appears}} first in The Hundred Days. He is close friends with Maturin, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> {{that they knew}} each other long before Dr. Jacob was {{introduced}} in the series. As Maturin's assistant surgeon and fellow naturalist, he plays a similar role to Martin, though as a physician he is much more medically competent and he often assists Maturin in his covert activities, using his previous profession as a jewel merchant as a cover. He is well liked by the hands of the Surprise both for his medical talent and for bringing Maturin a preserved hand, a specimen of Dupuytren's contracture, which the crew suppose is a Hand of Glory which will bring them luck.|$|E
50|$|In 1949 a {{rear-end}} collision {{took place at}} Glasgow Cross; a passenger train driven by an experienced driver ran through several stop signals standing at danger; low standards of attention to signalling equipment maintenance <b>were</b> exposed, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> that drivers <b>were</b> used to running through the line {{without being able to}} see many of the signals.|$|R

25|$|After the {{admission}} of Missouri as a slave state, the owning and sale of slaves continued in St. Louis, although as the town grew, {{the percentage of the}} population held as slaves declined. The treatment of slaves in St. Louis as compared with other areas is unclear; some evidence suggests mild to harsh treatment, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> that many slaves attempted to escape. Slave sales occurred usually through advertising in newspapers, with transactions conducted in hotels or private homes. Slaves often were held in the St. Louis jail prior to their movement to a particular farm or to a dealer. Many slaves worked on steamboats as crew or as laborers on the riverfront, and some escaped across the river to the free state of Illinois, continuing via the Underground Railroad to Canada. Some slaves also were hired out by their owners for farm or commercial work for periods of up to a year.|$|E
25|$|The {{moment of}} epiphany comes {{late in the}} play. At the {{beginning}} of Scene III, Oedipus is {{still waiting for the}} servant to be brought into the city, when a messenger arrives from Corinth to declare that King Polybus of Corinth is dead. Oedipus, when he hears this news, feels much relieved, because he believed that Polybus was the father whom the oracle had destined him to murder, and he momentarily believes himself to have escaped fate. He tells this all to the present company, including the messenger, but the messenger knows that it is not true. He is the man who found Oedipus as a baby in the pass of Cithaeron and gave him to King Polybus to raise. He reveals, furthermore that the servant who is being brought to the city as they speak is the very same man who took Oedipus up into the mountains as a baby. Jocasta realizes now all that has happened. She begs Oedipus not to pursue the matter further. He refuses, and she withdraws into the palace as the servant is arriving. The old man arrives, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> at once that he knows everything. At the behest of Oedipus, he tells it all.|$|E
25|$|No {{fighting}} is reported for 342. Instead the sources {{focus on a}} mutiny by part of the soldiery. According to the most common variant, following the Roman victories of 343 the Campani asked Rome for winter garrisons to protect them against the Samnites. Subverted by the luxurious lifestyle of the Campani, the garrison soldiers started plotting to seize control and set themselves up as masters of Campania. However the conspiracy was discovered by the consuls of 342 before the coup could be carried out. Afraid of being punished, the plotters mutinied, formed a rebel army and marched against Rome. Marcus Valerius Corvus was nominated dictator {{to deal with the}} crisis; he managed to convince the mutineers to lay down their arms without bloodshed and a series of economic, military and political reforms were passed to deal with their grievances. The history of this mutiny is however disputed among modern historians and {{it is possible that the}} whole narrative has been invented to provide a background for the important reforms passed this year. These reforms included the Leges Genuciae which stated that no one could be reelected to the same office within less than ten years, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> from the list of consuls that except in years of great crisis this law was enforced. It also became a firm rule that one of the consuls had to be a plebeian.|$|E
