60|$|Dare {{uncovered}} the drawings, and young Somerset's brain-work {{for the last}} six weeks lay under their eyes. To Dare, who was too cursory to trouble himself by entering into such details, it had very little meaning; but the design shone into Havill's head like a light into a dark place. It was original; and it was fascinating. Its originality lay partly in the circumstance that Somerset had not attempted to adapt an old building to the wants of the new civilization. He had placed his new erection beside it as a slightly <b>attached</b> <b>structure,</b> harmonizing with the old; heightening and beautifying, rather than subduing it. His work formed a palace, with a ruinous castle annexed as a curiosity. To Havill the conception had more charm than it could have to the most appreciative outsider; for when a mediocre and jealous mind that has been cudgelling itself over a problem capable of many solutions, lights on the solution of a rival, all possibilities in that kind seem to merge in the one beheld.|$|E

40|$|It appears {{practical}} {{to challenge the}} Orbiter DAP with a large, <b>attached</b> <b>structure.</b> The definition of this capability is a fundamental step {{in the development of}} nearly all large space systems currently under consideration. Experiment features may be incorporated that apply to control systems for large space systems such as modal damping devices. In a relatively simple deployable structure, the correlation of flight test results with ground test and analysis should provide a basis for extrapolation to more complex structures. Initial experiment concepts will provide a starting point for the examination of antenna feed mast requirements with the objective changing the design to produce a representative test article. Correlation of construction operations with ground simulations will provide for better task and time-line definition. EVA needs to be a direct benefit to the conduct of the experiment. Early consideration of safety issues is a precaution against defining an unacceptable experiment concept. Integration of many objectives seems feasible and is generally perceived as the only way to justify a relatively expensive experiment...|$|E
40|$|Group A Streptococcus (GAS) {{is a human}} {{specific}} pathogen {{capable of}} causing both mild infections and severe invasive disease. We and others have shown that GAS is able to form biofilms during infection. That is to say, they form a threedimensional, surface <b>attached</b> <b>structure</b> consisting of bacteria and a multi-component extracellular matrix. The mechanisms involved in regulation and dispersal of these GAS structures are still unclear. Recently we have reported that {{in the absence of}} the transcriptional regulator Srv in the MGAS 5005 background, the cysteine protease SpeB is constitutively produced, leading to increased tissue damage and decreased biofilm formation during a subcutaneous infection in a mouse model. This was interesting because MGAS 5005 has a naturally occurring mutation that inactivates the sensor kinase domain of the two component regulatory system CovRS. Others have previously shown that strains lacking covS are associated with decreased SpeB production due to CovR repression of speB expression. Thus, our results suggest the inactivation of srv can bypass CovR repression and lead to constitutive SpeB production. We hypothesized that Srv control of SpeB production may be a mechanism to regulate biofilm dispersal and provide a mechanism by which mild infection can transition to severe disease through biofilm dispersal. The question remained however, is this mechanism conserved among GAS strains or restricted to the unique genetic makeup of MGAS 5005. Here we show that Srv mediated control of SpeB and biofilm dispersal is conserved in the invasive clinical isolates RGAS 053 (serotype M 1) and MGAS 315 (serotype M 3), both of whic...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} Hypoelliptic Diffusion Maps (HDM), a framework generalizing Diffusion Maps {{in the context of}} manifold learning and dimensionality reduction. Standard non-linear dimensionality reduction methods (e. g., LLE, ISOMAP, Laplacian Eigenmaps, Diffusion Maps) focus on mining massive data sets using weighted affinity graphs; Orientable Diffusion Maps and Vector Diffusion Maps enrich these graphs by attaching to each node also some local geometry. HDM likewise considers a scenario where each node possesses additional structure, which is now itself of interest to investigate. Virtually, HDM augments the original data set with <b>attached</b> <b>structures,</b> and provides tools for studying and organizing the augmented ensemble. The goal is to obtain information on individual <b>structures</b> <b>attached</b> to the nodes and on the relationship between <b>structures</b> <b>attached</b> to nearby nodes, so as to study the underlying manifold from which the nodes are sampled. In this paper, we analyze HDM on tangent bundles, revealing its intimate connection with sub-Riemannian geometry and a family of hypoelliptic differential operators. In a later paper, we shall consider more general fibre bundles. Comment: 80 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{assess the}} {{frequency}} of valvar complications caused by left sided radiofrequency catheter ablation using the retrograde aortic technique.  METHODS— 179 patients (118  male) with a mean (SD) age of 43  (17) years underwent 216  procedures at one centre. The target of the ablation was an accessory atrioventricular pathway in 144  patients, the atrioventricular junction in 29  patients, and a ventricular tachycardia in six patients. In 25  patients structural heart disease was identified before the procedure (ischaemic heart disease 10, cardiomyopathy nine, valvar three, other three). Echo/Doppler examinations were performed {{the day before the}} procedure and within 24  hours postablation; the investigations were all reviewed by the same investigator. Patients with identified valvar injury caused by the procedure were followed for 42  (7) months.  RESULTS—Valvar injury caused by the ablation procedure was identified in four young (age 30  (8) years), otherwise healthy patients with left lateral atrioventricular accessory pathways. Mild mitral insufficiency with a central regurgitation jet was detected in two patients and remained unchanged at follow up. Mild aortic insufficiency was detected in another two patients. In one of these the regurgitation jet was central and remained unchanged at follow up. In one patient the regurgitation jet was located between the non-coronary and left cusps in relation to a loosely <b>attached</b> <b>structure.</b> Both the structure and the valvar regurgitation disappeared during follow up. No clinical complications occurred in any of the patients during follow up.  CONCLUSION—In this study, {{the frequency of}} valvar complications after left sided radiofrequency catheter ablation using the retrograde aortic technique was 1. 9 %.    Keywords: radiofrequency catheter ablation; valvar disorders; retrograde aorti...|$|E
