Due to its wide band gap, NTCDA does not absorb in the visible range and is furthermore exciton blocking. By doping with AOB (<b>acridine</b> orange <b>base),</b> its conductivity was raised to about 1 · 10 − 4 S/cm.

The stability of the (^ 71) Ga- NOTA complex was verified by in vivo NMR spectroscopy. The novel phosphinic acid NOTA analogue, bearing an isopropyl substituent on phosphorus was prepared and its lipophilicity and (^III) In biodistribution in mice determined. The crystal structure of the yttrium complex of N,N"-bis(benzylcarbamoylmethyl) diethylenetriamine-N,N',N"-triacetic acid revealed amide carbonyl ligation in a distorted mono-capped square antiprismatic structure, with one metal-bound water. The biodistribution of the analogous Gd complex was examined. A novel series of 9 N 3 based ligands incorporating three further N donor atoms, carboxymethyl groups and a potentially larger cavity size were synthesised. The analogous series containing phosphinic acid groups and the 12 N 3 counterparts were also prepared. The former series formed complexes with Gd and the biodistribution in mice was studied. The 12 N 3 analogues failed to form Gd complexes. 2 -Nitroimidazoles are known to selectively target hypoxic tumour tissue. Two conjugates of 2 -nitroimidazole for tumour imaging were prepared, the Gd complex of a DTPA-bis(2 -nitroimidazole) amide and the (^III) In complex of a C-functionalised NOTA- nitroimidazole conjugate. The biodistribution in mice of each was studied and luminescence experiments on the Tb complex of the former revealed one metal bound water molecule. Novel conjugates of the tetrapeptide tuftsin and a complexing agent based on the 12 N 4 skeleton and an N-linked NOTA derivative were synthesised. Biodistributions of the Gd and In complexes respectively are being carried out. Acridine intercalators reversibly bind DNA, possibly enhancing the effectiveness of tumour targeting conjugates.

Interface dipoles are observed at both hybrid interfaces, and the work function of Fe is increased by 0. 7 eV for the tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) case, while it is decreased by 1. 2 eV for the <b>acridine</b> orange <b>base</b> (AOB) case. According to XMCD results, TCNQ molecule has little influence on the spin polarization of Fe surface. In contrast, AOB molecule reduces the interfacial spin polarization of Fe significantly.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the results of}} experiments into the intra and inter-molecular binding of various ligands with dsDNA via the mechanism of intercalation, principally using the technique of atomic force microscopy (AFM). Since {{the description of the}} first AFM in the mid 1980 ’s, AFM has emerged as a sensitive and versatile analytical tool, capable both of detecting and manipulating artefacts at picometer resolutions. In these studies, AFM imaging, supported by circular dichroism, reveals unusual conformational changes in DNA that occur {{as a result of the}} binding of ligands that incorporate the acridine chromophore. These changes are distinct from those observed following the binding of other intercalators such as doxorubicin and echinomycin. Direct measurement of the length of linear DNA strands bound to <b>acridine</b> <b>based</b> ligands reveals a shortening of the DNA at very low ligand concentrations. This observation suggests that the structural changes that occur in DNA following the intercalation of the acridine chromophore are more wide ranging than previously thought and support molecular modeling studies that have proposed that the intercalated DNA duplex exhibits characteristics of both B and A form DNA. Variations in the conformational changes that occur in DNA as a result of intercalation may have implications for the application of new intercalating ligands as chemotherapeutic agents. In addition, single molecule force spectroscopy has been used to examine the capacity of bisintercalators to bind to DNA in an inter-molecular fashion. By stretching individual strands of dsDNA, acridine dimers are shown to bind to separate strands of DNA. Intermolecular binding of this kind remains an unexplored cytotoxic mechanism that may yet find an application in vivo. This observation is supported by a novel assay that utilises the controlled aggregation of gold nanoparticles. These nanoparticles, functionalised with DNA, are shown to aggregate on addition of a bisintercalator. The aggregation is fully reversible with the addition of sodium dodecylsulphate. These force spectroscopy experiments have also uncovered a previously unobserved, intermolecular binding mode of the peptide antibiotics echinomycin and TANDEM. In certain circumstances, these ligands are revealed to bind exclusively to the termini of separate DNA strands in a sequence dependent fashion. This finding may have implications for the employment of these ligands in the nanosciences, as a tool for joining short pieces of DNA or improving the efficiency of the enzymatic, blunt-end ligation of DNA...|$|R

We present herein the syntheses of trifunctional compounds, combining an <b>acridine</b> orange (AO) <b>based</b> intercalator with a GRP receptor specific bombesin like peptide (BBN). Metal-mediated conjugation of these two functions via the 2 + 1] approach to the third function, the M(CO) (3) ](+) (M = (99 m) Tc, Re) moiety, yielded the final trifunctional molecules. The strongly fluorescent acridine orange, a nuclear targeting agent, has been derivatised with 4 -imidazolecarboxylate as a bidentate ligand and bombesin with an isonitrile group as a monodentate ligand. For cell and nuclear uptake studies, Re(L(1) -BBN) (L(2) -Ical) (CO) (3) ] type complexes were synthesized and characterized. For radiopharmaceutical purposes, the (99 m) Tc analogues have been prepared in a stepwise synthesis.

Apoptosis was {{induced by}} α-TOS in a time- and concentration-dependent mode, {{and signs of}} apoptosis were visible at concentrations of α-TOS as low as 30 μM, and within 3 – 5 h after addition of the ester. Employing a specific fluorogenic substrate, caspase- 3 {{was found to be}} activated rapidly in response to α-TOS at 50 μM. We also found that Jurkat T cells challenged with α-TOS, when exposed to the lysosomotropic weak <b>base</b> <b>acridine</b> orange, showed decreased lysosomal uptake of the dye. This is suggestive of the involvement of lysosomal destabilisation in apoptosis of the cells. Apoptosis of Jurkat T cells induced with α-TOS also involved a drop in the mitochondrial membrane potential, although this phenomenon occurred after the initiation of lysosomal rupture. All apoptotic features observed with α-TOS were very similar to those found when cross-linking of the Fas receptor triggered apoptosis. These findings are consistent with the recent idea that vitamin E can contribute to elimination of malignant cells by the induction of apoptosis, and can be of (patho) physiological significance...|$|R
40|$|Oligothymidylates {{involving}} alternating alkyl phosphotriester-phosphodiester or methylphosphonate-phosphodiester backbones and covalently {{linked to}} an acridine derivative have been studied using circular dichroism. Two isomers with the same diastereoisomeric configuration for all the phosphotriesters (ethyl triester and neopentyl triester) or the methylphosphonate linkages were studied. These six compounds were compared to the parent oligonucleotide with unmodified phosphodiester bonds. Intramolecular interactions between the <b>acridine</b> and the <b>bases</b> of the oligonucleotides were revealed by the induced circular dichroism of the acridine dye. Binding to poly(rA) and poly(dA) induced large changes in the circular dichroism signal. All oligothymidylates formed double-stranded complexes with poly(rA). Substitution of phosphotriesters and methylphosphonates to phosphates allowed both double- and triple-stranded structures to be formed with with poly(dA). The double-stranded structures formed with poly(rA) and poly(dA) were characterized by different environments of the acridine dye. The circular dichroism spectra of the complexes with poly(dA) and the thermal stabilities of the complexes formed with both poly(rA) and poly(dA) were drastically dependent of the diastereoisomeric configuration of the phosphate modification. For the complexes formed with the pseudoequatorial stereoisomer the modification of the phosphate groups increased {{the stability of the}} complexes as compared with the oligothymidylate containing only phosphodiester linkages whereas it decreased it for pseudoaxial modifications...|$|R

Upon removal of ammonium chloride, the cells are able to rapidly reacidify this compartment. The highly convoluted plasma membrane of the osteoclast facing this acidic compartment (ruffled border) is shown to contain a 100 -kD integral membrane protein otherwise present in limiting membranes of lysosomes and other related acidified organelles (Reggio, H., D.

Within 2 h, gentamicin induced a partial relocalization [from lysosomes to cytosol] of the weak organic <b>base</b> <b>acridine</b> orange. We thereafter observed (a) a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (as from 10 h, based on spectrophotometric and confocal microscopy using JC 1 probe) and (b) the release of cytochrome c from granules to cytosol, and the activation of caspase- 9 (as from 12 h; evidenced by Western blot analysis). Increase in caspase- 3 activity (assayed with Ac-DEVD-AFC {{in the presence of}} z-VAD-fmk]) and appearance of fragmented nuclei (DAPI staining) was then detected as from 16 to 24 h together with nuclear fragmentation. Gentamicin produces a fast (within 4 h) release of calcein from negatively-charged liposomes at pH 5. 4, which was slowed down by raising the pH to 7. 4, or when phosphatidylinositol was replaced by cardiolipin (to mimic the inner mitochondrial membrane).

After {{the discovery of}} acridine in the late 1800 's, the acridine class of molecules attracted much synthetic interest due to their usefulness as dyestuffs and the discovery that certain acridine derivatives possessed anti-bacterial properties. It was this discovery that lead aminoacridines to be used heavily as anti-bacterial agents until they were supplanted {{by the use of}} sulfonamides and the discovery of the penicillin's. Despite falling out of favor as anti-bacterial agents, acridine derivatives were still used in the treatment of other diseases such as malaria and cancer. Despite falling out of use as anti-bacterial agents, one area where the acridine class of compounds may find a new use is in the treatment of drug-resistant bacterial infections, namely MRSA. Infections caused by numerous drug-resistant bacteria have become a major health issue in the world today which has led to a pressing need for the development of novel agents to treat these infections. We report within this thesis the synthesis and evaluation of numerous <b>acridine</b> and acridone <b>based</b> compounds that possess activity against a number of strains of MRSA.

40|$|Secretion {{granules}} {{have been}} {{isolated from the}} parotid glands of rats that have been chronically stimulated with the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol. These granules are of interest because they package a quantitatively different set of secretory proteins in comparison with granules from the normal gland. Polypeptides enriched in proline, glycine, and glutamine, which {{are known to have}} pI's greater than 10, replace alpha-amylase (pI's = 6. 8) as the principal content species. The internal pH of granules from the treated rats ranges from 7. 8 in a potassium sulfate medium to 6. 9 in a choline chloride medium. The increased pH over that of normal parotid granules (approximately 6. 8) appears to reflect the change in composition of the secretory content. Whereas normal mature parotid granules have practically negligible levels of H+ pumping ATPase activity (Arvan, P., G. Rudnick, and J. D. Castle, 1985, J. Biol. Chem., 260, 14945 - 14952) the isolated granules from isoproterenol-treated rats undergo a time-dependent internal acidification (approximately 0. 2 pH unit) that requires the presence of ATP and is abolished by an H+ ionophore. Additionally, an inside- positive granule transmembrane potential develops after ATP addition that depends upon ATP hydrolysis. Two independent methods have been used that exclude the possibility that contaminating organelles are the source of the H+-ATPase activity. Together these data provide clear evidence for the presence of an H+ pump in the membranes of parotid granules from chronically stimulated rats. However, despite the presence of H+-pump activity, fluorescence microscopy with the weak <b>base,</b> <b>acridine</b> orange, reveals that the intragranular pH in live cells is greater than that of the cytoplasm...|$|R

We studied {{the effect of these}} secretogogues on the pH difference (delta pH) across the membranes of the secretory granules of isolated parafollicular cells. The trapping of the weak <b>bases,</b> <b>acridine</b> orange or 3 -(2, 4 dinitro anilino) - 3 '-amino- N-methyl dipropylamine (DAMP), within the granules was used to evaluate delta pH. In contrast to lysosomes, which served as an internal control, the secretory granules of resting parafollicular cells displayed a limited and variable ability to trap either acridine orange or 3 -(2, 4 dinitro anilino) - 3 '-amino-N-methyl dipropylamine; however, when parafollicular cells were stimulated with TSH or elevated [Ca 2 +]e, the granules acidified. Weak base trapping was also used to evaluate the ATP-driven H+ translocation into isolated parafollicular granules. The isolated parafollicular granules did not acidify in response to addition of ATP unless their transmembrane potential was collapsed by the K+ ionophore, valinomycin. Secretory granules isolated from TSH- treated parafollicular cells had a high chloride conductance than did granules isolated similarly from untreated cells. Furthermore, ATP- driven H+ translocation into parafollicular granules isolated from TSH- stimulated parafollicular cells occurred {{even in the absence of}} valinomycin. These results demonstrate that secretogogues can regulate the internal pH of the serotonin-storing secretory granules of parafollicular cells by opening a chloride channel associated with the granule membrane.

40|$|Coxiella burnetii and Chlamydia trachomatis are {{bacterial}} obligate intracellular parasites that occupy distinct vacuolar niches within eucaryotic host cells. We {{have employed}} immunofluorescence, cytochemistry, fluorescent vital stains, and fluid-phase markers {{in conjunction with}} electron, confocal, and conventional microscopy to characterize the vacuolar environments of these pathogens. The acidic nature of the C. burnetii-containing vacuole was confirmed by its acquisition of the acidotropic <b>base</b> <b>acridine</b> orange (AO). The presence of the vacuolar-type (H+) ATPase (V-ATPase) within the Coxiella vacuolar membrane was demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence, and growth of C. burnetii was inhibited by bafilomycin A 1 (Baf A), a specific inhibitor of the V-ATPase. In contrast, AO did not accumulate in C. trachomatis inclusions nor was the V-ATPase found in the inclusion membrane. Moreover, chlamydial growth was not inhibited by Baf A or the lysosomotropic amines methylamine, ammonium chloride, and chloroquine. Vacuoles harboring C. burnetii incorporated the fluorescent fluid- phase markers, fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-dex) and Lucifer yellow (LY), indicating trafficking between that vacuole and the endocytic pathway. Neither FITC-dex nor LY was sequestered by chlamydial inclusions. The late endosomal-prelysosomal marker cation-independent mannose 6 -phosphate receptor was not detectable in the vacuolar membranes encompassing either parasite. However, the lysosomal enzymes acid phosphatase and cathepsin D and the lysosomal glycoproteins LAMP- 1 and LAMP- 2 localized to the C. burnetii vacuole but not the chlamydial vacuole. Interaction of C. trachomatis inclusions with the Golgi-derived vesicles was demonstrated by the transport of sphingomyelin, endogenously synthesized from C 6 -NBD-ceramide, to the chlamydial inclusion and incorporation into the bacterial cell wall. Similar trafficking of C-NBD-ceramide was not evident in C. burnetii-infected cells. Collectively, the data indicate that C. trachomatis replicates within a nonacidified vacuole that is disconnected from endosome-lysosome trafficking but may receive lipid from exocytic vesicles derived from the trans-Golgi network.

40|$|Produced {{water is}} an {{environmental}} toxic and complex mixture, which is co-produced during {{gas and oil}} production. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the surface tension of the produced water with a bubble pressure tensiometer, BP 100. The influence of the pH of the brine and the brine composition were studied together with the effect of the crude oil composition. The results were supposed to be related to flotation, which is a common separation technique regarding produced water treatment. To achieve a high separation efficiency the spreading coefficient must be positive and this is obtainable if the surface tension between the produced water and the gas bubbles is high. UV/VIS spectrometer was utilized toinvestigate other chemical properties of the produced water. Three oils (H, E and C) and four brines with various pH were investigated by BP 100 and UV/VIS. An extraction of the organic compounds in two produced water samples and further investigation with IR was done. The purpose was to see if the extraction solvent and IR was an appropriate method for characterization of produced water. On the basis of the results of this research, it can be concluded that the pH of the brine have a larger influence on the surface tension of the produced water than the composition of the brine. For crude oil H, which contain very high TAN, the greatest changes in surface tension was observed at high pH. For crude oil E, which has a very low amount of resins and asphaltenes, there were no significant changes, both in terms of pH and brine composition. Crude oil C contains a great amount of resins and asphaltenes. The influence on the surface tension were large for all pH values, and there were also observed salting-out effect. The crude oil composition regarding surface pressure did not give major trends. The UV measurements indicated that organic molecules were present in all the samples. Four peaks were observed for the samples made of brine with pH 2, contrary to only two peaks for the other samples. The maximums given for the samples of pH 2 might correspond to pyridines, quinolines and <b>acridines</b> (basic compounds) <b>based</b> on their UV spectra. Infrared spectroscopy was conducted for two samples. Absorption peaks were found, and they were related to different organic functional groups that are common for produced water.
