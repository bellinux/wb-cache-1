40|$|The {{susceptibility}} to several oligopeptide and amino acid <b>antifungals</b> of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain carrying multiple deletions in yeast multidrug resistance genes {{was compared to}} transformants containing the CDR 1, CDR 2, or MDR 1 genes that encode the major Candida albicans drug efflux pumps. Recombinant yeast strains overexpressing Cdr 1 p and Cdr 2 p showed enhanced susceptibilities to all tested oligopeptide <b>antifungals.</b> The enhanced susceptibilities of multidrug-resistant yeast strains to oligopeptide <b>antifungals</b> corresponded to higher rates of oligopeptide uptake. Yeast cells overexpressing Cdr 1 p or Cdr 2 p effluxed protons at higher rates than the reference cells lacking these ABC transporters.

5|$|Extracts of Narcissus have {{demonstrated}} {{a number of}} potentially useful biological properties including antiviral, prophage induction, antibacterial, <b>antifungal,</b> antimalarial, insecticidal, cytotoxic, antitumor, antimitotic, antiplatelet, hypotensive, emetic, acetylcholine esterase inhibitory, antifertility, antinociceptive, chronotropic, pheromone, plant growth inhibitor, and allelopathic. An ethanol extract of Narcissus bulbs was found effective in one mouse model of nociception, para-benzoquinone induced abdominal constriction, but not in another, the hot plate test. Most of these properties are due to alkaloids, but some are also due to mannosa-binding lectins. The most-studied alkaloids in this group are galantamine (galanthamine), lycorine, narciclasine, and pretazettine.|$|E

40|$|A {{disorder}} {{first described}} by Zoon in 1952, Zoon`s balanitis or Plasma cell balanitis (PCB), is an uncommon clinical disorder seen in middle-aged uncircumcised men.

This balanitis does not respond to routine topical <b>antifungals,</b> steroid creams and systemic <b>antifungals.</b> Diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy. Herein we report 8 cases of PCB, presenting with a characteristic clinical picture of the disease. In all cases circumcision was done and histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of PCB. All patients were followed up for a period of 6 months and no recurrences were observed. Development of malignancy is not seen. In conclusion.

5|$|Polytolypa is a {{monotypic}} genus of fungus {{containing the}} single species Polytolypa hystricis.

Polytolypa hystricis contains bioactive compounds that have <b>antifungal</b> activity.|$|E

40|$|Azole <b>antifungals</b> are {{reported}} to interfere with fungal growth by selective impairment of the P- 450 dependent 14 α-demethylase system key to biosynthesis of ergosterol (ERG), thus leading to the depletion of this sterol in fungal membranes and to the accumulation of methylated precursors. We have investigated whether azole <b>antifungals</b> ketoconazole, miconazole, econazole, or itraconazole were able to modify the sterol and fatty acid patterns of a toxigenic strain of Aspergillus parasiticus, inducing the growth of mycelium depleted of ergosterol (ERG) and rich in less oxidisable sterols. It had been demonstrated that oxidation of ERG is correlated to aflatoxin biosynthesis. However, in this study no alteration of sterol or fatty acid patterns was observed after 7, 14, and 21 days of incubation of A. parasiticus {{in the presence of}} sublethal doses of azole <b>antifungals.</b> Specific production of aflatoxin was unaffected. Among the four <b>antifungals</b> tested, itraconazole was the strongest inhibitor of fungal growth and aflatoxin production while ketoconazole was the least effective...|$|R

5|$|While {{classified}} as generally recognized as {{safe in the}} US, juniper berries may have various side effects that have not been tested extensively in clinical trials. Mainly due to an increased risk of miscarriage, even in small doses, consuming juniper berries may affect pregnant or breastfeeding women and people with diabetes, bleeding disorders or after surgery. In traditional medicine, juniper berries were used for female birth control. In an in vitro study, juniper essential oil was studied for its possible antimicrobial and <b>antifungal</b> properties.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{tests have}} shown P.semilanceata to {{suppress}} {{the growth of the}} soil-borne water mold Phytophthora cinnamomi, a virulent plant pathogen that causes the disease root rot. When grown in dual culture with other saprobic fungi isolated from the rhizosphere of grasses from its habitat, P.semilanceata significantly suppresses their growth. This <b>antifungal</b> activity, which can be traced at least partly to two phenolic compounds it secretes, helps it compete successfully with other fungal species in the intense competition for nutrients provided by decaying plant matter. Using standard antimicrobial susceptibility tests, Psilocybe semilanceata was shown to strongly inhibit the growth of the human pathogen methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The source of the antimicrobial activity is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Many drugs, {{including}} oral contraceptives, some antibiotics, antidepressants, and <b>antifungal</b> agents, inhibit cytochrome enzymes in the liver. They {{reduce the}} rate of elimination of the benzodiazepines that are metabolized by CYP450, leading to possibly excessive drug accumulation and increased side-effects. In contrast, drugs that induce cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as St John's wort, the antibiotic rifampicin, and the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and phenytoin, accelerate elimination of many benzodiazepines and decrease their action. Taking benzodiazepines with alcohol, opioids and other central nervous system depressants potentiates their action. This often results in increased sedation, impaired motor coordination, suppressed breathing, and other adverse effects that have potential to be lethal. Antacids can slow down absorption of some benzodiazepines; however, this effect is marginal and inconsistent.|$|E
