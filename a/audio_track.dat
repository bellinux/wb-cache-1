5|$|Also on November 28, 2006, a 14-disc DVD box set titled Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition was released, {{containing}} Superman, Superman II, , Superman III, Superman IV, Superman Returns, and , {{among other}} releases. All {{contents of the}} set were housed within a tin case. The set was valued at US$99.92, and received extremely positive reviews when first released. However, after only {{a day on the}} market, Warner Bros. announced that there were two errors discovered within the set. The first was that the 2.0 <b>audio</b> <b>track</b> on Superman, was instead the 5.1 <b>audio</b> <b>track</b> already on the disc. The second was that the Superman III disc was not the 2006 deluxe edition as advertised, but the 2001 release instead. The set was soon recalled, and Warner Bros. offered a toll-free number to replace the faulty discs for people who had already purchased the set. Due to popular demand, a corrected set was released and Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition returned to store shelves on May 29, 2007.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{reliability}} and the scalability of content-based retrieval of variant <b>audio</b> <b>tracks</b> from large music databases, we suggest a new multi-stage LSH scheme that consists in (i) extracting compact but accurate repre-sentations from <b>audio</b> <b>tracks</b> by exploiting the LSH idea to summarize <b>audio</b> <b>tracks,</b> and (ii) adequately organizing the resulting representations in LSH tables, retaining almost the same accuracy as an exact kNN retrieval. In the first stage, we use major bins of successive chroma features to calcu-late a multi-probe histogram (MPH) that is concise but re-tains the information about local temporal correlations. In the second stage, based on the order statistics (OS) of the MPH, we propose a new LSH scheme, OS-LSH, to organize and probe the histograms. The representation and organi-zation of the <b>audio</b> <b>tracks</b> are storage efficient and support robust and scalable retrieval. Extensive experiments over a large dataset with 30, 000 real <b>audio</b> <b>tracks</b> confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme...|$|R
