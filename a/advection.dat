5|$|Constant {{pressure}} charts normally contain plotted {{values of}} temperature, humidity, wind, and the vertical height {{above sea level}} of the pressure surface. They {{have a variety of}} uses. In the mountainous terrain of the western United States and Mexican Plateau, the 850 hPa pressure surface can be a more realistic depiction of the weather pattern than a standard surface analysis. Using the 850 and 700 hPa pressure surfaces, one can determine when and where warm <b>advection</b> (coincident with upward vertical motion) and cold <b>advection</b> (coincident with downward vertical motion) is occurring within the lower portions of the troposphere. Areas with small dewpoint depressions and are below freezing indicate the presence of icing conditions for aircraft. The 500 hPa pressure surface {{can be used as a}} rough guide for the motion of many tropical cyclones. Shallower tropical cyclones, which have experienced vertical wind shear, tend to be steered by winds at the 700 hPa level.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the rapid}} motion of Nanmadol, the typhoon crossed Luzon in under six hours, {{emerging}} into the South China Sea before 1800UTC on December2. Though land interaction with the Philippines did not significantly affect the cyclone, a shortwave trough forced Nanmadol to sharply curve northward, bringing it into hostile atmospheric conditions within the Luzon Strait. At 0000UTC on December3, the JMA downgraded Nanmadol to severe tropical storm status. Increased wind shear and the <b>advection</b> of dry air further weakened the tropical cyclone, and by midday on December3, the storm's center of circulation became decoupled {{from the rest of}} the convection. At 2340UTC that day, Nanmadol made landfall near Fangliao, Pingtung in Taiwan, becoming the first December tropical cyclone to strike the island in 108years of record-keeping. Roughly six hours later on December4, the JMA determined that Nanmadol had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. These remnants soon merged with another low-pressure area, creating a more powerful system that later tracked over Japan.|$|E
5|$|Increased {{precipitation}} {{during the}} Tauca phase was probably {{triggered by the}} southern movement of the ITCZ and the strengthening of the South America monsoon, possibly caused by chilling in the northern hemisphere. Combined with a southern shift of high pressure zones, increased moisture during late glacial times would have flowed from the Amazon. This change, which occurred from 17,400–12,400 years or 18,000–11,000 BP, is recorded in Bolivian Chaco and Brazilian cave records. The Tauca phase may have been triggered by the southern shift of tropical atmospheric circulation. Although another theory posits that vegetation changes and lake development would have decreased the albedo of the Altiplano, resulting in warming and moisture <b>advection</b> of moisture towards the Altiplano, but such positive feedback mechanisms were considered questionable in a 1998 study. Persistent La Niña climatic conditions {{may have contributed to}} the lake's filling. Conversely, a global climatic warming and a northward shift of the monsoon occurred around 14,500 years ago. The ideal conditions for the development of paleolakes in the Altiplano do not appear to exist during maximum glaciation or warm interglacial periods.|$|E
5|$|The main ways {{water vapor}} {{is added to}} the air are: wind {{convergence}} into areas of upward motion, precipitation or virga falling from above, daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies or wet land, transpiration from plants, cool or dry air moving over warmer water, and lifting air over mountains. Water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds. Elevated portions of weather fronts (which are three-dimensional in nature) force broad areas of upward motion within the Earth's atmosphere which form clouds decks such as altostratus or cirrostratus. Stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass. It can also form due to the lifting of <b>advection</b> fog during breezy conditions.|$|E
5|$|Vera only {{maintained}} {{peak intensity}} for roughly twelve hours, but still remained a powerful tropical cyclone. With very {{little change in}} strength, the typhoon tracked northwestward throughout September24. Due {{to the influence of}} a nearby high-pressure area, Vera began to gradually curve and rapidly accelerate northward towards Japan. At 0900UTC on September26, Vera made its first landfall on Honshu, just west of Shionomisaki. At the time, the typhoon had maximum sustained winds of 260km/h (160mph) and a barometric pressure of 920mbar (hPa; 27.17inHg). Vera traversed the Japanese island rather quickly at a speed 61km/h (38mph), and emerged into the Sea of Japan at 1530UTC that day. Despite its short stint over land, the terrain greatly weakened the tropical cyclone. Tracking into a westerly wind flow, Vera was forced eastward, resulting in a second landfall near Sakata, Honshu, with an intensity equivalent to that of a Category1 hurricane. Vera re-emerged into the North Pacific Ocean late on September26, having weakened due to <b>advection</b> of cold air in addition to continued land interaction. At 0600UTC on September27, the JTWC analyzed the typhoon to have weakened to tropical storm intensity. The warning center discontinued its periodic monitoring of the system, as Vera had begun to transition into an extratropical cyclone. Consequently, the JMA officially reclassified the system as an extratropical storm at 1200UTC that day. Vera's extratropical remnants continued to persist and track eastward for the next two days before the JMA last noted the storm at 1200UTC on September29.|$|E
25|$|M≥MEdd, rather disk-like shapes, {{and almost}} thermal spectra. They are cooled by <b>advection,</b> and are radiatively ineffective. They were {{introduced}} by Abramowicz, Lasota, Czerny and Szuszkiewicz in 1988.|$|E
25|$|As in {{the case}} of <b>advection</b> turning, when there is a cross-isothermal {{component}} of the geostrophic wind, a sharpening of the temperature gradient results. Thermal wind causes a deformation field and frontogenesis may occur.|$|E
25|$|Biotic {{factors include}} {{nutrient}} uptake and primary production, secondary production of zooplankton, food web and trophic dynamics, energetic transfer, <b>advection</b> and dispersal {{in and out}} of the system, survival and mortality, predation, and competition from introduced species.|$|E
25|$|When each {{data point}} {{is itself a}} function, it can be useful to see the {{interpolation}} problem as a partial <b>advection</b> problem between each data point. This idea leads to the displacement interpolation problem used in transportation theory.|$|E
25|$|All {{calculations}} show large heating (up to 80°C) {{at the top}} of {{the smoke}} layer at about 10km; this implies a substantial modification of the circulation there and the possibility of <b>advection</b> of the cloud into low latitudes and the southern hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|Detritivores {{capitalize}} {{upon this}} energy source, creating an alternate and parallel food web of potentially large importance. This is because carbon fixation into the detrital food web {{is not limited}} by stratification, turbidity or day length, all of which limit photosynthesis. Detrital production occurs continuously, limited only by inputs and <b>advection</b> out of the Delta system.|$|E
25|$|The annual {{rainfall}} regime {{is generated by}} two factors: general atmospheric circulation, physical and geographical conditions, respectively. <b>Advection</b> of temperate oceanic air from west and north-west direction, especially during the summer, as well as frequent ingress of cold air masses from the north or those temperate continental from north-east and east, during the winter, plus <b>advection</b> of maritime tropical air from the south-west and south, explain all influences of atmospheric action centres which are felt in this area. Taking into account these elements, plus relief influences, atmospheric rainfall are unevenly spread across the county. The average amount of precipitation is 600–700mm, in Zalău being 634.2mm (calculated for the period 1961–1990). The most abundant precipitation falls in summer, when besides frontal processes occurs the intense thermal convection, causing showers, rich in terms of quantity. During the winter, rainfall is less quantitatively, {{although the number of}} days with precipitation is not smaller. By and large, the pluviometric maximum overlaps the months of May–June, and the pluviometric minimum is registered in January–February.|$|E
25|$|By 6 pm, the shortwave axis {{was over}} eastern Missouri and was lifting northeast. At 7 pm, the low was placed near Indianapolis, Indiana with {{numerous}} thunderstorms {{east and south}} of the low and a squall line was moving into the southeastern US. Cold air <b>advection</b> behind the strong cold front fed into the cyclone as snow and sleet fell from eastern Iowa to central Michigan. At 7 am on March 19 the low was deepening and lifting rapidly northeastward into Canada.|$|E
25|$|The air {{entrainment}} {{occurs in the}} form of air bubbles and air packets entrapped at the impingement of the upstream jet flow with the roller. The air packets are broken up in very small air bubbles as they are entrained in the shear region, characterised by large air contents and maximum bubble count rates. Once the entrained bubbles are advected into regions of lesser shear, bubble collisions and coalescence lead to larger air entities that are driven towards the free-surface by a combination of buoyancy and turbulent <b>advection.</b>|$|E
25|$|Weightlessness {{can cause}} serious {{problems}} on technical instruments, especially those consisting of many mobile parts. Physical processes {{that depend on}} {{the weight of a}} body (like convection, cooking water or burning candles) act differently in free-fall. Cohesion and <b>advection</b> play a bigger role in space. Everyday work like washing or going to the bathroom are not possible without adaptation. To use toilets in space, like the one on the International Space Station, astronauts have to fasten themselves to the seat. A fan creates suction so that the waste is pushed away. Drinking is aided with a straw or from tubes.|$|E
25|$|The {{severity}} of the Blizzard of 2003 {{can be attributed to}} the unusually favorable atmospheric conditions surrounding the storm (synoptic conditions). Most notably, the storm allowed for cyclogenesis off of the coastal Carolinas, a feature that is common to most major winter storms in the eastern parts of North America. This secondary system fed off the moisture of the Atlantic Ocean and enhanced precipitation totals from North Carolina to Massachusetts. Secondly, a high pressure system was in place over eastern portions of Canada, allowing for cold air to be brought down into the coastal areas in a process known as cold air <b>advection.</b> This cold air ensured that many areas where storms typically produce mixed precipitation received most or all precipitation in the form of snow.|$|E
25|$|The depth {{penetration}} of bomb tritium can be separated into 3 distinct layers. Layer 1 is the shallowest layer and includes the deepest, ventilated layer in winter; {{it has received}} tritium via radioactive fallout and lost some due to <b>advection</b> and/or vertical diffusion and contains approximately 28% of {{the total amount of}} tritium. Layer 2 is below the first layer but above the 26.81 isopycnal and is no longer part of the mixed layer. Its 2 sources are diffusion downward from the mixed layer and lateral expansions outcropping strata (poleward); it contains about 58% of the total tritium. Layer 3 is representative of waters that are deeper than the outcrop isopycnal and can only receive tritium via vertical diffusion; it contains the remaining 14% of the total tritium.|$|E
25|$|There {{exists a}} class of 'radiatively inefficient' {{solutions}} to the equations that govern accretion. The most widely known {{of these is the}} <b>Advection</b> Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF), but other theories exist. In this type of accretion, which is important for accretion rates well below the Eddington limit, the accreting matter does not form a thin disc and consequently does not efficiently radiate away the energy that it acquired as it moved close to the black hole. Radiatively inefficient accretion has been used to explain the lack of strong AGN-type radiation from massive black holes at the centres of elliptical galaxies in clusters, where otherwise we might expect high accretion rates and correspondingly high luminosities. Radiatively inefficient AGN would be expected to lack many of the characteristic features of standard AGN with an accretion disc.|$|E
25|$|This {{decline in}} {{productivity}} is essentially {{due to the}} redirection of the pelagic network to a benthic chain by this one species. Because the Amur River clam feeds on primary producers, consumers and predators, it impacts multiple trophic levels. Consequently, nearly all plankton exhibit signs of apparent competition, in that production at one trophic level impacts all others by increasing clam abundance. This results in a negative feedback loop: C. amurensis limits plankton biomass, which in turn limits C. amurensis. However, inputs from outside the system due to tidal <b>advection</b> or upstream sources may increase C. amurensis biomass, further driving plankton limitation. This feedback loop is further amplified because the clam may persist {{for more than one}} or two years, which puts added pressure on plankton populations during cycles of low productivity.|$|E
25|$|The {{horizontal}} {{structure of}} each lens {{is influenced by}} variations in the type and porosity of the subsurface deposits, which on Diego Garcia are minor. At depth, the lens is globular; near the surface, it generally conforms {{to the shape of}} the island. When a Ghyben-Herzberg lens is fully formed, its floating nature will push a freshwater head above mean sea level, and if the island is wide enough, the depth of the lens below mean sea level will be 40 times the height of the water table above sea level. On Diego Garcia, this equates to a maximum depth of 20 m. However, the actual size and depth of each lens is dependent on the width and shape of the island at that point, the permeability of the aquifer, and the equilibrium between recharging rainfall and losses to evaporation to the atmosphere, transpiration by plants, tidal <b>advection,</b> and human use.|$|E
25|$|In the North Pacific Ocean, the tritium (introduced as bomb tritium in the Northern Hemisphere) {{spread in}} three dimensions. There were {{subsurface}} maxima {{in the middle}} and low latitude regions, which is indicative of lateral mixing (<b>advection)</b> and diffusion processes along lines of constant potential density (isopycnals) in the upper ocean. Some of these maxima even correlate well with salinity extrema. In order to obtain the structure for ocean circulation, the tritium concentrations were mapped on 3 surfaces of constant potential density (23.90, 26.02, and 26.81). Results indicated that the tritium was well-mixed (at 6 to 7nbsp&TU) on the 26.81 isopycnal in the subarctic cyclonic gyre and there appeared to be a slow exchange of tritium (relative to shallower isopycnals) between this gyre and the anticyclonic gyre to the south; also, the tritium on the 23.90 and 26.02 surfaces appeared to be exchanged at a slower rate between the central gyre of the North Pacific and the equatorial regions.|$|E
25|$|Following peak intensity, further {{strengthening}} was inhibited due to {{the emergence}} of a high pressure area over the United States Gulf Coast. The presence of this system injected dry air into Hilda, gradually weakening the hurricane. The once prominent eye of the storm clouded over {{as a result of this}} <b>advection.</b> During the evening hours of Octobernbsp&3, Hilda made landfall on the central Louisiana coast with a minimum pressure of 950nbsp&mbar (hPa; 28.06nbsp&inHg) and maximum sustained winds of , making it equivalent to a Categorynbsp&3 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Rapid weakening followed landfall as a result of the surrounding cold air; by 0600UTC on October4, Hilda had been downgraded to tropical storm intensity. The same area of high pressure which had weakened the tropical cyclone later forced Hilda eastward, resulting in the storm's merging with a cold front and thus transitioning into an extratropical cyclone later that day. These extratropical remnants continued to track eastward before they were last noted near Jacksonville, Florida on October5.|$|E
25|$|By 1630 UTC, {{the large}} MCS began to {{splinter}} into two sections: {{the southern part}} slowed, lagging into southeast Tennessee, while the northern part accelerated, reaching Pennsylvania by 1930 UTC. The split was related to several factors, including a band of subsidence over eastern Kentucky and western West Virginia; local downslope winds over the Appalachians; and an inversion over the same area. These factors allowed {{the northern part of}} the MCS to accelerate due to efficient ducting, while the southern part slowed as the boundary layer warmed and moistened. Numerous surface-based supercells began to develop in the southern area, beginning with one that produced an F3 tornado at about 1630 UTC near Cleveland, Tennessee. Meanwhile, a new band of scattered thunderstorms developed at 1500 UTC over eastern Arkansas and Missouri; over the next four hours, this band became the focus for several intense supercells, starting in eastern Illinois and southern Indiana. In the wake of the MCS, backing low-level winds, rapid diurnal destabilization, and perhaps cool, mid-level <b>advection</b> had occurred over the warm sector, weakening the convective inhibition (CINH) layer, and favorable wind profiles bolstered helicity to over 230 m²/s²—a combination of factors conducive to tornadogenesis. Consequently, the storms increased in intensity and coverage as they moved into Illinois, Indiana, and northern Kentucky, producing several tornadoes, including the first F5 tornado of the day, at 1920 UTC, near Depauw, Indiana. Several of the storms to form between 1920 and 2020 UTC became significant, long-lived supercells, producing many strong or violent tornadoes, including three F5s at Depauw; Xenia, Ohio; and Brandenburg, Kentucky. These storms formed the second of three convective bands to generate tornadoes.|$|E
500|$|The final {{storm of}} the season {{developed}} in the Bay of Campeche on October18 {{at the tail end}} of a frontal boundary. Although cool-air <b>advection</b> was occurring off the United States coast, warm air around the system allowed the tropical storm to intensify. Moving to the northeast, the system reached peak intensity as a high-end tropical storm with winds of [...] Ultimately, the cool-air <b>advection</b> eventually took a toll on the storm, causing it to quickly weaken. By 06:00UTC on October21, the storm dissipated.|$|E
500|$|Environmental {{steering}} is {{the dominant}} term. Conceptually, it represents {{the movement of the}} storm due to prevailing winds and other wider environmental conditions, similar to [...] "leaves carried along by a stream". Physically, the winds, or flow field, in the vicinity of a tropical cyclone may be treated as having two parts: the flow associated with the storm itself, and the large-scale background flow of the environment in which the storm takes place. In this way, tropical cyclone motion may be represented to first-order simply as <b>advection</b> of the storm by the local environmental flow. This environmental flow is termed the [...] "steering flow".|$|E
500|$|With strong upper-level support—including {{extensive}} positive vorticity <b>advection</b> and dual divergent jet streak regions—the storm explosively intensified into {{a powerful}} nor'easter. From 00:00to 12:00 UTC on December12, the system deepened by 27mbar while {{moving to a}} point south of Nantucket. By contrast, the widely accepted criterion for [...] "bombogenesis" [...] is a 24-mbar central pressure drop in 24hours. Its core pressure ultimately fell to 966 mbar by 00:00 UTC the next day, while located {{off the coast of}} southwestern Nova Scotia. A rapidly tightening pressure gradient north of the cyclone generated strong winds throughout coastal New England. The storm started to slowly weaken as it moved over the Canadian Maritimes on December 13 and 14.|$|E
500|$|Like the {{remainder}} of the Southeastern United States, Florida has a winter maximum in dense fog conditions. Unlike {{the remainder}} of the region, the maximum in Florida contains roughly half of the annual occurrences per year, on average. Its summer minimum is less than {{the remainder of}} the Southeast. The annual number of heavy fog days (with visibility of [...] or less) has ranged from 50 in Tallahassee, to 1 in Key West, the least foggy region in the state. The two types of fog that are most common in Florida are <b>advection</b> and radiational. Fog can be hazardous to early morning commuters. On January 9, 2008, when fog on Interstate 4 combined with smoke from a nearby fire, visibility was reduced to nearly zero. As a result, five individuals died in a 70-car pileup.|$|E
500|$|On a {{molecular}} scale, {{there are two}} main competing reaction processes involved in the degradation of cellulose, or wood fuels, in wildfires. [...] When there is a low amount of moisture in a cellulose fiber, volatilization of the fuel occurs; this process will generate intermediate gaseous products that will ultimately be the source of combustion. [...] When moisture is present—or when enough heat is being carried away from the fiber, charring occurs. The chemical kinetics of both reactions indicate that there is a point at which the level of moisture is low enough—and/or heating rates high enough—for combustion processes become self-sufficient. Consequently, changes in wind speed, direction, moisture, temperature, or lapse rate at different levels of the atmosphere can {{have a significant impact on}} the behavior and growth of a wildfire. Since the wildfire acts as a heat source to the atmospheric flow, the wildfire can modify local <b>advection</b> patterns, introducing a feedback loop between the fire and the atmosphere.|$|E
500|$|The {{two major}} ways {{thunderstorms}} move are via <b>advection</b> {{of the wind}} and propagation along outflow boundaries towards sources of greater heat and moisture. Many thunderstorms move with the mean wind speed through the Earth's troposphere, the lowest [...] of the Earth's atmosphere. Weaker thunderstorms are steered by winds closer to the Earth's surface than stronger thunderstorms, as the weaker thunderstorms are not as tall. Organized, long-lived thunderstorm cells and complexes move at a right angle to the direction of the vertical wind shear vector. If the gust front, or leading edge of the outflow boundary, races ahead of the thunderstorm, its motion will accelerate in tandem. This is more of a factor with thunderstorms with heavy precipitation (HP) than with thunderstorms with low precipitation (LP). When thunderstorms merge, which is most likely when numerous thunderstorms exist in proximity to each other, the motion of the stronger thunderstorm normally dictates the future motion of the merged cell. The stronger the mean wind, the less likely other processes will be involved in storm motion. On weather radar, storms are tracked by using a prominent feature and tracking it from scan to scan.|$|E
500|$|The Beta <b>Advection</b> Model (BAM) {{has been}} used operationally since 1987 using {{steering}} winds averaged through the 850 hPa to 200 hPa layer and the Beta effect which causes a storm to drift northwest {{due to differences in}} the coriolis effect across the tropical cyclone. [...] The larger the cyclone, the larger the impact of the beta effect is likely to be. [...] Starting in 1990, three versions of the BAM were run operationally: [...] the BAM shallow (BAMS) average winds in an 850 hPa to 700 hPa layer, the BAM Medium (BAMM) which uses average winds in an 850 hPa to 400 hPa layer, and the BAM Deep (BAMD) which {{is the same as the}} pre-1990 BAM. [...] For a weak hurricane without well-developed central thunderstorm activity, BAMS works well, because weak storms tend to be steered by low-level winds. [...] As the storm grows stronger and associated thunderstorm activity near its center gets deeper, BAMM and BAMD become more accurate, as these types of storms are steered more by the winds in the upper-level. [...] If the forecast from the three versions is similar, then the forecaster can conclude that there is minimal uncertainty, but if the versions vary by a great deal, then the forecaster has less confidence in the track predicted due to the greater uncertainty. Large differences between model predictions can also indicate wind shear in the atmosphere, which could affect the intensity forecast as well.|$|E
