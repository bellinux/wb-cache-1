Hydrogen spillover has emerged as a possible technique for achieving high-density hydrogen storage at near-ambient conditions in lightweight, solid-state materials as adsorbents. Hydrogen storage in carbon materials can be significantly enhanced by spillover techniques. Current trends include the use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and other porous materials with high surface area for such storage, including but not exclusive to nanocarbons (e.g. graphene, carbon nanotubes), zeolites, and nanostructured materials. Hydrogen <b>atom</b> <b>diffusion</b> on nanostructured graphitic carbon materials is primarily governed by physisorption of hydrogen atoms.

50|$|Precipitation {{hardening}} (also called age hardening) is {{a process}} where a second phase that begins in solid solution with the matrix metal is precipitated out of solution with the metal as it is quenched, leaving particles of that phase distributed throughout to cause resistance to slip dislocations. This is achieved by first heating the metal to a temperature where the elements forming the particles are soluble then quenching it, trapping them in a solid solution. Had it been a liquid solution, the elements would form precipitates, just as supersaturated saltwater would precipitate small salt crystals, but <b>atom</b> <b>diffusion</b> in a solid is very slow at room temperature. A second heat treatment at a suitable temperature is then required to age the material. The elevated temperature allows the dissolved elements to diffuse much faster, and form the desired precipitated particles. The quenching is required since the material otherwise would start the precipitation already during the slow cooling. This type of precipitation results in few large particles rather than the, generally desired, profusion of small precipitates. Precipitation hardening {{is one of the}} most commonly used techniques for the hardening of metal alloys.|$|E

There are three kinds of island structures on Si(111) - 7 x 7 surface. They are single island on terrace, island with hole structure on terrace and the island along at steps.

Compared to diffusion bonding which also relies on <b>atom</b> <b>diffusion</b> effect, the bonding time of rigid restraint TSCB is relatively short.
