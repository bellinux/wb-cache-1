25|$|The Socialist Party, however, {{refused to}} condemn the McNamara brothers, arguing that their actions were {{justified}} {{in view of the}} supposed employer- and state-sponsored terror their union had faced for the last 25 years. Haywood and Debs echoed that sentiment. Wrote Debs:It is easy enough for a gentleman of education and refinement to sit at his typewriter and point out the crimes of the workers. But let him be one of them himself, reared in hard poverty, denied education, thrown into the brute struggle for existence from childhood, oppressed, exploited, forced to strike, clubbed by the police, jailed while his family is evicted, and his wife and children are hungry, and he will hesitate {{to condemn the}}se as criminals who fight against the crimes of which they <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> such savage methods as have been forced upon them by their masters.|$|E
500|$|The Wrongs of Woman is what in {{the late}} eighteenth century was called a Jacobin novel, [...] a {{philosophical}} novel that advocated the ideals of the French Revolution. Wollstonecraft's novel argues along with others, such as Mary Hays's Memoirs of Emma Courtney (1796), that women <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> constant and systematic injustice. Wollstonecraft uses the philosophical dialogues in her novel to demonstrate women's powerlessness.|$|E

500|$|There are however {{instances}} where people <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> civil-rights violations {{that occur in}} circumstances involving both government officials and private actors. In the 1960s, the United States Supreme Court adopted an expansive view of state action {{opening the door to}} wide-ranging civil-rights litigation against private actors when they act as state actors (i.e., acts done or otherwise [...] "sanctioned in some way" [...] by the state). The Court found that the state action doctrine is equally applicable to denials of privileges or immunities, due process, and equal protection of the laws.|$|E
500|$|Makeba {{has also}} been {{associated}} with the movement against colonialism, with the civil rights and black power movements in the US, and with the Pan-African movement. She called for unity between black people of African descent across the world: [...] "Africans who live everywhere should fight everywhere. The struggle is no different in South Africa, the streets of Chicago, Trinidad or Canada. The Black people <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> capitalism, racism and oppression, period". After marrying Carmichael she often appeared with him during his speeches; Carmichael later described her presence at these events as an asset, and Feldstein wrote that Makeba enhanced Carmichael's message that [...] "black is beautiful". Along with performers such as Simone, Lena Horne, and Abbey Lincoln, she used her position as a prominent musician to advocate for civil rights. Their activism has been described as simultaneously calling attention to racial and gender disparities, and highlighting [...] "that the liberation they desired could not separate race from sex". Makeba's critique of second-wave feminism as being the product of luxury led to observers being unwilling to call her a feminist. Scholar Ruth Feldstein stated that Makeba and others influenced both black feminism and second-wave feminism through their advocacy, and the historian Jacqueline Castledine referred to her as one of the [...] "most steadfast voices for social justice".|$|E

Men both caused prostitution and enforced the system that shamed and punished the women who were its victims.|$|E

2500|$|Speaking to the Aldershot and North Hants Conservative Association on 4 February 1983, Powell {{blamed the}} United Nations for the Falklands War by the General Assembly {{resolution}} of December 1967 that stated [...] "its {{gratitude for the}} continuous efforts made by the Government of Argentina to facilitate the process of decolonisation" [...] and further called on Britain and Argentina to negotiate. Powell said that [...] "it {{would be difficult to}} imagine a more cynically wicked or criminally absurd or insultingly provocative action". As 102 had voted for this resolution, with only Britain voting against it (with 32 abstentions), he claimed it was not surprising that Argentina had continually threatened Britain until this threatening turned into aggression: [...] "It is with the United Nations that the guilt lies for the breach of the peace and the bloodshed". The UN knew that no international forum had ruled against British possession of the Falklands but had voted its gratitude to Argentina who wanted to annexe the Islands from their rightful owners. It was therefore [...] "disgraceful" [...] for Britain to belong to such a body that engaged in [...] "pure spite for spite's sake against the United Kingdom": [...] "We were, and <b>are,</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> our own insincerity. For over thirty years we have sanctimoniously and dishonestly pretended respect, if not awe, for an organisation which all the time we knew was a monstrous and farcical humbug....

60|$|The most {{convenient}} arrangement of these plays {{appears in the}} First Folio (1623) [Footnote: This was {{the first edition of}} Shakespeare's plays. It was prepared seven years after the poet's death by two of his fellow actors, Heminge and Condell. It contained all the plays now attributed to Shakespeare with the exception of Pericles.] where they are grouped in three classes called tragedies, comedies and historical plays. The tragedy is a drama in which the characters <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> unhappy passions, or are involved in desperate circumstances. The style is grave and dignified, the movement stately; the ending is disastrous to individuals, but illustrates the triumph of a moral principle. These rules of true tragedy are repeatedly set aside by Shakespeare, who introduces elements of buffoonery, and who contrives an ending that may stand for the triumph of a principle but that is quite likely {{to be the result of}} accident or madness. His best tragedies are Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, King Lear and Othello.|$|E
