He authorized me to put together an updated inspection plan to take place following his August visit to Baghdad.|$|E
500|$|Pope Pius IX's {{determination}} to keep Edgardo {{developed into a}} strong paternal attachment. According to Edgardo's memoirs, the pontiff regularly spent time with him and played with him; the Pope would amuse the child by hiding him under his cassock and calling out: [...] "Where's the boy?" [...] At one of their meetings, Pope Pius told Edgardo: [...] "My son, you have cost me dearly, and I have suffered a great deal because of you." [...] He then said to others present: [...] "Both the powerful and the powerless tried to steal this boy from me, and <b>accused</b> <b>me</b> of being barbarous and pitiless. They cried for his parents, but they failed to recognise that I, too, am his father." ...|$|E
500|$|So far, {{changes to}} the {{original}} had been of a minor nature, but when the opera reappeared in June 1869 it had been entirely restructured. Although the musical numbers were still linked by dialogue, the first act had been divided in two, to create a three-act opera. Various numbers, including the drinking song and the new polka, were repositioned, and the polka was now followed by a furiant. A [...] "March of the Comedians" [...] was added, to introduce the strolling players in what was now Act III. A short duet for Esmeralda and the Principal Comedian was dropped. In September 1870 The Bartered Bride reached its final form, when all the dialogue was replaced by recitative. Smetana's own opinion of the finished work, given much later, was largely dismissive: he described it as [...] "a toy ... composing it was mere child's play". It was written, he said [...] "to spite those who <b>accused</b> <b>me</b> of being Wagnerian and incapable of doing anything in a lighter vein." ...|$|E

Because they cannot attack our record, they accuse us falsely of calling for election violence - when we have only insisted on peace. Even as Head of State, we never imposed Sha'riah." ...|$|R

2500|$|Karam's 2002 album, Tahamouni, was {{far removed}} from the [...] "easy going" [...] {{contemporary}} feel of Oyoun Qalbi and Nedmaneh, and audiences noticed. The album was intended to get back in touch with a more youthful audience from other Arab nations, with whom had taken slight dis-interest in Karam's music from the late 90s. This was shown though songs like Tahamouni (They <b>accused</b> <b>me)</b> which included attempts at rapping, and Ew'a Tekoun Ze'alt (I hope you're not mad at me) which seemed to have a complete Western influence. The songs had a youthful sound.|$|E

2500|$|Olbermann has {{addressed}} the assertions of liberal bias {{by stating that}} he would be equally critical of a Democratic president who had invited criticism by his actions: [...] "I mean, no one in 1998, no one <b>accused</b> <b>me</b> of being a liberal in 1998 because I was covering the Lewinsky scandal. And whatever I had to do about it, I tried to be fair and honest and as accurate and as informed as possible, and allow my viewer to be the same way. And nowadays it's the same thing.

2500|$|Vang further {{testified that}} Joseph Crotteau {{deserved}} to die [...] "because he <b>accused</b> <b>me</b> of {{giving him the}} finger and tried to cut {{in front of me}} to stop me from leaving." [...] And Laski deserved to die because he had a gun, he said. Vang re-enacted his deeds while on the stand, using his hands and arms to imitate the motions of firing a rifle. Vang's lawyers commented that some of his abnormal remarks were due to the language barrier. Therefore, when Vang responded affirmatively to the question that Mr. Crotteau and Mr. Laski [...] "deserved to die," [...] his meaning implied that the men contributed to the circumstances that led to their deaths.|$|E
2500|$|On April 28, 1932, Bow {{signed a}} two-picture deal with Fox Film Corporation, for Call Her Savage (1932) and Hoop-La (1933). Both were successful; Variety favored the latter. The October 1934, Family Circle Film Guide rated {{the film as}} [...] "pretty good entertainment", and of Miss Bow said: [...] "This is the most {{acceptable}} bit of talkie acting Miss Bow has done." [...] However, they noted, [...] "Miss Bow is presented in her dancing duds as often as possible, and her dancing duds wouldn't weigh two pounds soaking wet."

[...] According to a village elder interviewed by the Toronto Globe and Mail: [...] "Perhaps because {{of the history of}} feuding with the Arabs around us we allied ourselves with the Jews...against the British. We did not join the Arabs from the other villages bombarding Jewish vehicles in 1947. The Palmach fought many villages around us. But there was an order to leave us alone. The other Arabs never thought there would be a Jewish government here...During the first truce of the War of Independence, I {{was on my way to}} Ramallah to see my father and uncles, and I was captured by Jordanian soldiers.

2500|$|In 1967, she {{performed}} as Carmen in the Carmen Suite, choreographed specifically for her by Cuban choreographer Alberto Alonso. The music was re-scored from Bizet’s original by her husband, Rodion Shchedrin, and its themes were re-worked into a [...] "modernist and almost abstract narrative." [...] Dancer Olympia Dowd, who performed alongside her, writes that Plisetskaya’s dramatic portrayal of Carmen, her favorite role, {{made her a}} legend, and soon became a [...] "landmark" [...] in the Bolshoi's repertoire. Her Carmen, however, at first [...] "rattled the Soviet establishment," [...] which was [...] "shaken with her Latin sensuality." [...] She was aware that her dance style was radical and new, saying that [...] "every gesture, every look, every movement had meaning, was different from all other ballets... The Soviet Union was not ready {{for this sort of}} choreography. It was war, they <b>accused</b> <b>me</b> of betraying classical dance." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{financial}} crisis that originated in Thailand in 1997 was particularly unnerving {{because of its}} scope and severity.... By the beginning of 1997, {{it was clear to}} Soros Fund Management that the discrepancy between the trade account and the capital account was becoming untenable. We sold short the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit early in 1997 with maturities ranging from six months to a year. (That is, we entered into contracts to deliver at future dates Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit that we did not currently hold.) Subsequently Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia <b>accused</b> <b>me</b> of causing the crisis, a wholly unfounded accusation. We were not sellers of the currency during or several months before the crisis; on the contrary, we were buyers when the currencies began to decline—we were purchasing ringgits to realize the profits on our earlier speculation. (Much too soon, as it turned out. We left most of the potential gain on the table because we were afraid that Mahathir would impose capital controls. He did so, but much later.) ...|$|E

She also claims {{that she was}} only used for two-thirds of her contracted appearances. She said: [...] "In the 18 months I was in EastEnders, I had no impact. There was nothing that made people sit up and take notice of what Josie was doing. It was like they remembered I was around and threw me a line where I would slide into the bar and say, 'Hello, how are you' and then sit on a stool and say nothing {{for the rest of the}} episode. I came to feel that I was letting the black community down because my character was so empty. People of my own colour often accosted me in public and <b>accused</b> <b>me</b> of playing a token black. I was so little-used that they even wrote me cheques for episodes I never appeared in. So why did they not use me? Why are they wasting the taxpayers' money? It was very dispiriting." ...|$|E

[...] While promising to adopt a constitution opposed by the governors Morales said Bolivia's [...] "democratic revolution" [...] had to be seen through saying [...] "We have always cried 'fatherland or death'. If we don't emerge victorious, we have to die for the country and the Bolivian people." [...] Morales also said he would not hesitate to extend the state of emergency to other opposition-controlled departments. Rubén Costas, the governor of Santa Cruz, belittled the chances of a breakthrough in talks adding that [...] "if there is just one more death or person wounded, any possibility of dialogue will be broken." ...|$|E
