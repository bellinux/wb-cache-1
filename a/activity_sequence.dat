40|$|Abstract—The running logs of {{a process}} hold {{valuable}} information about its executed activity behavior and generated activity logic structure. Theses informative logs can be extracted, analyzed and utilized to improve the efficiencies of the process's execution and conduction. One of the techniques used to accomplish the process improvement is called as process mining. To mine similar processes is such an improvement mission in process mining. Rather than directly mining similar processes using a single comparing coefficient or a complicate fitness function, this paper presents a simplified heuristic process mining algorithm with two similarity comparisons {{that are able to}} relatively conform the <b>activity</b> logic <b>sequences</b> (traces) of mining processes with those of a normalized (regularized) one. The relative process conformance is to find which of the mining processes match the required <b>activity</b> <b>sequences</b> and relationships, further for necessary and sufficient applications of the mined processes to process improvements. One similarity presented is defined by the relationships {{in terms of the number}} of similar <b>activity</b> <b>sequences</b> existing in different processes; another similarity expresses the degree of the similar (identical) <b>activity</b> <b>sequences</b> among the conforming processes. Since these two similarities are with respect to certain typical behavior (<b>activity</b> <b>sequences)</b> occurred in an entire process, the common problems, such as the inappropriateness of an absolute comparison and the incapability of an intrinsic information elicitation, which are often appeared in other process conforming techniques, can be solved by the relative process comparison presented in this paper. To demonstrate the potentiality of the proposed algorithm, a numerical example is illustrated. Keywords—process mining, process similarity, artificial intelligence, process conformance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Scheduling {{problems}} typically {{deal with}} <b>activity</b> <b>sequencing</b> and resource allocation while {{the problem of}} activity selection {{is assumed to be}} resolved before scheduling. To increase flexibility of scheduling systems in complex environments, it is possible to include activity selection, for example decisions about alternative process routes, in the scheduling problem. This could be realized by assuming optional activities in the problem specification. Constraint-based scheduling seems to be a good underlying technology to model problems both with traditional scheduling decisions such as <b>activity</b> <b>sequencing</b> and resource allocation, and with planning-like decisions such as selection among alternative activities. The paper studies search strategies for solving scheduling problems with optional activities – the search procedure assumes both sequencing decisions and selection among alternative activities...|$|R

40|$|Distributed systems {{consist of}} many dierent objects, {{participating}} in distributed <b>activity</b> <b>sequences.</b> We present {{a system for}} state-dependent security decisions (SDSD), {{which can be used}} to specify and to enforce sets of allowed <b>activity</b> <b>sequences.</b> A specication is expressed as a protocol, which denes such a set as a regular language. The protocol is transformed into a nite automaton. Instantiated copies of the automaton are deployed by the actually participating objects, each of which has been wrapped by the SDSD-system with a security object. Knowing the automaton and based on additional control messages, the security objects can locally decide, whether a requested action is allowed or not. A running prototype implementing the SDSD-system is described, and its full integration into CORBA is outlined...|$|R

50|$|Based on all {{of these}} findings, {{researchers}} have developed a possible model for the funeral <b>activity</b> <b>sequence</b> that took place at Wanar. The sequence has three distinct phases: Phase one includes cutting the graves in the subsoil with funerary rites, such as covering the graves with mounds; phase two is when the standing stones were raised around the mounds; and phase three consisted of erecting frontal stones. Phase three may also have been when these monuments became sites of ritual activities and ceramics started getting deposited around them. The creators of this model recognize that other sequences are possible, and the order for the sequence of events at the double circle may have been different as well.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Within organizations, {{workflow}} {{systems can}} automate business processes by centrally coordinating <b>activity</b> <b>sequences.</b> But outside their borders, organizations are autonomous entities that cannot {{be subject to}} centralized process control. Their internal processes are autonomously defined and controlled, and what they need is to synchronize those concurrent processes. Just like Petri nets are a valuable tool to model <b>activity</b> <b>sequencing</b> in local business processes, π-calculus becomes a useful tool to model concurrency in inter-organizational processes. After {{a review of the}} main developments in cross-organizational workflow management, this paper illustrates the use of π-calculus to model the interactions between business processes running concurrently in different organizations. These interactions range from invoking external services to more complex patterns such as contract negotiation and partner search and selection. The paper concludes with a case study that illustrates the application of the proposed approach in a more realistic business scenario. ...|$|R
40|$|Multi-Agent Plan Recognition (MAPR) {{seeks to}} {{identify}} the dynamic team structures and team behaviors from the observed <b>activity</b> <b>sequences</b> (team traces) {{of a set of}} intelligent agents, based on a library of known team <b>activity</b> <b>sequences</b> (team plans). Previous MAPR systems require that team traces and team plans are fully observed. In this paper we relax this constraint, i. e., team traces and team plans are allowed to be partial. This is an important task in applying MAPR to real-world domains, since in many applications {{it is often difficult to}} collect full team traces or team plans due to environment limitations, e. g., military operation. This is also a hard problem since the information available is limited. We propose a novel approach to recognizing team plans from partial team traces and team plans. We encode the MAPR problem as a satisfaction problem and solve the problem using a state-of-the-art weighted MAX-SAT solver. We empirically show that our algorithm is both effective and efficient...|$|R

Men have lower intrapersonal variability than women in daily trips, time use and <b>activity</b> <b>sequence.</b> Students have lower intrapersonal variability but only when under age of 25. Older adults (housewife, worker or pensioner), single people and those without children also have lower variability. We note incidentally that “Worker” is not significant.|$|E
30|$|In this section, {{we apply}} the {{variability}} measurements to the indicators of travel/activity behaviour {{based on the}} survey. These indicators are the number of trips and home-based tours per day, individuals’ daily activity time use and daily <b>activity</b> <b>sequence.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{share of}} intrapersonal {{variability}} in trips or tours generation is maximal during the overall week (Monday to Sunday) {{while this is}} the opposite when restricted to the two weekend days. In the case of trip generation in the weekend the difference between people becomes more important. As regards <b>activity</b> <b>sequence,</b> the variability is minimal during the weekend period, at a significantly lower level than on other days. This confirms the peculiarity of the two weekend days as {{to the nature of}} activities when compared with working days. With respect to travel behaviour (trip generation and cutting out of activities through <b>activity</b> <b>sequence)</b> Sunday definitely stands out as a different day from the other days of the week, i.e. whether the traditional working days or Saturday.|$|E

50|$|The {{density of}} {{functional}} proteins in sequence space, and {{the proximity of}} different functions to one another is a key determinant in understanding evolvability. The degree of interpenetration of two neutral networks of different <b>activities</b> in <b>sequence</b> space will determine {{how easy it is}} to evolve from one activity to another. The more overlap between different <b>activities</b> in <b>sequence</b> space, the more cryptic variation for promiscuous activity will be.|$|R
30|$|Moreover, the {{previous}} analysis {{suggests that the}} intrapersonal variability of individuals’ daily travel, time use and <b>activity</b> <b>sequence</b> is likely to depend on individuals’ demographic and employment status. Hence, we distinguish four categories: 1. student, schoolboy (−girl); 2. housewife (or husband) unemployed, disabled person; 3. pensioner; 4 worker.|$|E
30|$|The {{overall picture}} of a large {{intrinsic}} variability in travel behaviour (i.e. trip or home-based tour generation) is confirmed. There is more difference {{in the number of}} trips per day for a given individual depending on the various days of week than there is between individuals per se, not including the weekend period, and this aspect is reinforced when considering home-based tours. Unlike the case of trip generation, there is greater difference between persons in their daily time allocation to various activities than between days for a given person in general, either during working days or during the weekend. This is also the case for daily <b>activity</b> <b>sequence.</b> Finally, the influence of socio-demographic characteristics on intrapersonal variability is weak, whether for daily trips, tours, time use or <b>activity</b> <b>sequence.</b>|$|E
40|$|Collaborative {{activity}} performed over specific platforms, {{designed for}} such purpose, {{can provide a}} deep knowledge about the roles, intentions and effects regarding participants and their interaction among themselves and with the knowledge objects available. This study aims at proposing a structured process for gathering the semantics of the activity hidden behind the raw data collected in log files from CSCL platforms. The proposal is based on exploring the semantic elements (activity awareness) through a social networks analysis (SNA). The main focus of our work is to match different behavioral profiles detected in the collaborative activity from CSCL with the formal profiles identified inside a complex concept-network. This network defines an ontology that describes the behavior expected when collaborating in different scenarios and types of activity. When a certain <b>activity</b> <b>sequence</b> matches with a predefined pattern, the concepts related to the pattern are then bound to the real <b>activity</b> <b>sequence...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{amount of}} social events has {{increased}} significantly and location-based services {{have become an}} integral part of our life. This makes the recommendation of <b>activity</b> <b>sequences</b> an important emerging application. Recently, the notion of a distributed event (e. g. festival or cruise) that gathers multiple competitive activities has appeared in the literature. An attendee of such events is overwhelmed with numerous possible activities and faces the problem of activity selection with the goal to maximise satisfaction of experience. This selection is subject to various uncertainties. In this paper, we formulate the problem of recommendation of <b>activity</b> <b>sequences</b> as a combination of personalised event recommendation and scheduling problem. We present a new integrated framework to solve it and two computation strategies to analyse the categorical, temporal and textual users' interests. We mine the users' historical traces to extract their behavioural patterns and use them in the construction of the itinerary. The evaluation of our approach on a dataset built over a cruise program shows an average improvement of 9. 7 % over the state-of-the-art...|$|R
