5|$|As a new recruit in the Brotherhood of Nod, {{the player}} {{initially}} performs tasks for the Brotherhood's second-in-command, a man known as Seth. After Seth attempts to deploy the player in an operation against the United States military without Kane's approval, Kane kills him and thereafter issues commands to the player directly. The player's {{goal is to}} drive GDI forces out of North Africa {{through the use of}} both conventional and unconventional warfare. In a ploy to secure victory for Nod, the player is assigned to gain control of GDI's space-based ion cannon, and to establish Nod's Temple in South Africa. The campaign ends with the entire <b>African</b> <b>continent</b> under Nod's control, and with the Brotherhood planning to achieve the same in Europe. The conclusion of the campaign allows the player to choose a historical landmark to destroy with GDI's hijacked ion cannon, in order to shatter GDI's public image. Potential targets include the White House, the British Houses of Parliament, the Eiffel Tower and the Brandenburg Gate.|$|E

5|$|Bonita {{emerged into}} the Mozambique Channel as a {{significantly}} diminished storm, though it quickly regained {{some of its}} previous intensity. Three days after its initial landfall, the cyclone moved ashore over the Zambezia Province of Mozambique. Throughout northern parts of the country, Bonita triggered extensive flooding that damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings and reportedly killed 17 individuals. Swollen rivers submerged roads and bridges, isolating some locations. A meteorological rarity, Bonita continued inland for several days, persisting as a distinct tropical low; the system traversed southern Africa and ultimately entered the South Atlantic Ocean. In the process, it dropped unseasonably heavy rainfall over Zimbabwe and Zamibia. A paper published by the Zambia Meteorological Department asserted that Bonita was the first storm confirmed to have tracked across the <b>African</b> <b>continent</b> from the South-West Indian Ocean to the Southern Atlantic Ocean.|$|E

He said that his experiences in previous Olympic Games would aid him in progressing up the world rankings.

5|$|The {{origins of}} Manuel {{can be traced}} back to a {{tropical}} wave that left the <b>African</b> <b>continent</b> in late August. The wave entered the Caribbean Sea on September 5, although the northern portion of the wave axis later developed into Hurricane Ingrid. On September10, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked the potential for a low-pressure area to develop off the southwest coast of Mexico during the subsequent few days, provided the system remained offshore. The next day, a low formed while it was nearly stationary, accompanied by scattered convection. Strong wind shear and proximity to land were expected to limit development, although conditions became more favorable on September12. On that day, the convection became better organized. At 1200UTC on September13, the NHC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Thirteen-E, noting that the system had enough of a well-defined circulation and convection. By that time, wind shear had diminished and warm waters were expected to allow intensification, and the main inhibiting factors for development were proximity to Mexico and association with the intertropical convergence zone.|$|E
