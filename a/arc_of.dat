40|$|The <b>arc</b> graph δ(G) <b>of</b> a digraph G is the digraph {{with the}} set <b>of</b> <b>arcs</b> <b>of</b> G as vertex-set, where the <b>arcs</b> <b>of</b> δ(G) join {{consecutive}} <b>arcs</b> <b>of</b> G. In 1981, Poljak and Rödl characterised the chromatic number of δ(G) {{in terms of}} the chromatic number of G when G is symmetric (i. e., undirected). In contrast, directed graphs with equal chromatic numbers can have arc graphs with distinct chromatic numbers. Even though the <b>arc</b> graph <b>of</b> a symmetric graph is not symmetric, we show that the chromatic number <b>of</b> the iterated <b>arc</b> graph δ^k(G) still only depends on the chromatic number of G when G is symmetric.

5|$|By {{combining}} {{the distance between}} the aircraft and satellite, speed, and heading with aircraft performance constraints (e.g. fuel consumption, possible speeds and altitudes), investigators generated candidate paths that were analysed separately by two methods. The first assumed the aircraft was flying on one of the three autopilot modes (two are further affected by whether the navigation system used magnetic north or true north as a reference), calculated the BTO and BFO values along these routes, and compared them with the values recorded from Flight 370. The second method generated paths which had the aircraft's speed and heading adjusted at the time of each handshake to minimise the difference between the calculated BFO of the path and the values recorded from Flight 370. A probability distribution for each method at the BTO <b>arc</b> <b>of</b> the sixth handshake of the two methods was created and then compared; 80 percent of the highest probability paths for both analyses combined intersect the BTO <b>arc</b> <b>of</b> the sixth handshake between 32.5°S and 38.1°S, which can be extrapolated to 33.5°S and 38.3°S along the BTO <b>arc</b> <b>of</b> the seventh handshake.|$|E

25|$|Because <b>arcs</b> <b>of</b> {{circles and}} ellipses cannot be exactly {{represented}} by Bézier curves, they are first approximated by Bézier curves, {{which are in}} turn approximated by <b>arcs</b> <b>of</b> circles. This is inefficient as there exists also approximations of all Bézier curves using <b>arcs</b> <b>of</b> circles or ellipses, which can be rendered incrementally with arbitrary precision. Another approach, used by modern hardware graphics adapters with accelerated geometry, can convert exactly all Bézier and conic curves (or surfaces) into NURBS, that can be rendered incrementally without first splitting the curve recursively to reach the necessary flatness condition. This approach also allows preserving the curve definition under all linear or perspective 2D and 3D transforms and projections.|$|R
