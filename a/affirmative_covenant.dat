5000|$|In {{property}} law, land-related covenants {{are called}} [...] "real covenants" [...] {{and are a}} major form of covenant, typically imposing restrictions on how the land may be used (negative covenants) or requiring a certain continuing action (<b>affirmative</b> <b>covenant).</b> These may also [...] "run with the land" [...] (called a covenant appurtenant), meaning that any future owners of the land must abide by the terms, or may apply to a particular person (called a covenant in gross).

5000|$|A {{covenant}} {{is a type}} {{of contract}} in which the covenantor makes a promise to a covenantee to do (<b>affirmative</b> <b>covenant)</b> or not do some action (negative covenant). In real property law, the term real covenants is used for conditions tied to the use of land. A [...] "covenant running with the land", also imposes duties or restrictions upon the use of that land regardless of the owner. Restrictive covenants are somewhat similar to easements and equitable servitudes, leading to some discussion about whether these concepts should be unified; the Restatement (Third) of Property takes steps to merge these concepts as servitudes. Real covenant law in the United States has been referred to as an [...] "unspeakable quagmire" [...] by one court.|$|E

40|$|The North Carolina Court of Appeals in Figure Eight Beach Homeowners 2 ̆ 7 Association v. Parker, {{rejected}} the defendant property owner 2 ̆ 7 s interpretation of several earlier decisions. The property owner claimed the earlier decisions required <b>affirmative</b> <b>covenants</b> to contain some ascertainable standards {{by which the}} court could objectively determine the amount and purposes of the assessments. The Court of Appeals claimed, however, it was applying the same standards {{set forth in the}} earlier decisions regarding the enforceability of similar covenants. In essence, the court 2 ̆ 7 s adoption of a broader interpretation of the earlier case law validates stricter enforcement of assessment covenants by property owners 2 ̆ 7 assocations which seek revenues to provide services to the residential development. Why the court took this position in light of the language of its earlier decisions, as well as the impact of the decision on residential development in North Carolina, will be the subjects of this note.
