5|$|Like all Phallaceae species, C.columnatus is saprobic, {{and uses}} {{extracellular}} digestion to acquire nutrients from dead and decaying organic matter, like wood.

It can often be found growing in and around gardens and residences where areas of cultivation or landscaping have resulted in accumulations of mulch, wood chips or other cellulose-rich materials. The mycelial cords can be traced to buried roots, stumps, and other woody material. The species grows in sandy soil, near woody debris, in lawns, gardens, and cultivated soil. Fruit bodies appear singly, or scattered, and can <b>arise</b> <b>in</b> the summer, autumn, and early winter, especially after wet weather.|$|E

40|$|Aims: To {{report the}} {{exceedingly}} rare occurrence of oligodendroglioma in the glial component of ovarian teratomas. Methods: Six cases of oligodendrogliomas <b>arising</b> <b>in</b> the glial component of ovarian teratomas were studied and the literature was reviewed. Immunohistochemistry {{was performed by}} the Flex technique. Results: The ages of the Patients ranged from 12 to 28 years (mean 21 years). Four tumours were located in the right {{and one in the}} left ovary. The size of the ovarian cysts ranged from 7 cm to 29 cm (mean 19. 6 cm). Four cases <b>arose</b> <b>in</b> immature and two cases in mature teratomas. In all cases, oligodendroglioma was WHO grade II. On immunohistochemistry, glial fibrillary acidic protein stain was positive in all cases. The Mib 1 (Ki 67) proliferative index was low and the tumour cells were negative for synaptophysin. Follow-up was available in five Patients and ranged from 1 to 42 months. Two Patients died of disease after 1 and 36 months of diagnosis, respectively. In both these cases oligodendroglioma <b>arose</b> <b>in</b> an immature teratoma. The remaining three Patients are alive with a follow-up of 4 - 42 months. Conclusion: Oligodendroglioma <b>arising</b> <b>in</b> the glial component of ovarian teratomas is exceedingly rare. Ovarian teratomas should be extensively sampled and carefully evaluated to rule out the possibility of a glial tumour. This is the single and largest series of oligodendrogliomas <b>arising</b> <b>in</b> ovarian teratomas.
