5|$|The {{forecasting}} of the precipitation {{within the}} next six hours {{is often referred to}} as nowcasting. In this time range it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy, as well as other features too small to be resolved by <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>model.</b> A human given the latest radar, satellite and observational data will be able to make a better analysis of the small scale features present and so will be able to make a more accurate forecast for the following few hours. However, there is now expert systems using those data and mesoscale numerical model to make better extrapolation, including evolution of those features in time.|$|E
25|$|While the UV Index can be {{calculated}} from a direct measurement of the UV spectral power at a given location, as some inexpensive portable devices are able to approximate, the value given in weather reports is usually a prediction based on <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>model.</b> Although this may be in error (especially when cloud conditions are unexpectedly heavy or light), it is usually within ±1 UV Index unit as that which would be measured.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> was {{developed}} to simulate the physical oceanographic effects of one or several 100 megawatt OTEC plant(s). The model suggests that OTEC plants can be configured such that the plant can conduct continuous operations, with resulting temperature and nutrient variations that are within naturally occurring levels. Studies to date suggest that by discharging the OTEC flows downwards at a depth below 70 meters, the dilution is adequate and nutrient enrichment is small enough so that 100 megawatt OTEC plants could be operated in a sustainable manner on a continuous basis.|$|E
25|$|By the 1970s, new {{problems}} such as overpopulation, limited natural resources and pollution {{that could not be}} solved by normal hierarchical systems had arrived.

This was turned into <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>model,</b> which predicted population collapse. This became the basis of the model that was used by the Club of Rome, and the findings from this were published in The Limits to Growth.

25|$|Passive marker systems, using {{reflective}} markers (typically reflective balls), {{allows for}} accurate measurement of movements using multiple cameras (typically five to twelve cameras), simultaneously. The cameras utilize high-powered strobes (typically red, near infrared or infrared) with matching filters {{to record the}} reflection from the markers placed on the body. Markers are located at palpable anatomical landmarks. Based on the angle and time delay between the original and reflected signal, triangulation of the marker in space is possible. Software is used to create three dimensional trajectories from these markers that are subsequently given identification labels. <b>A</b> <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> is then used to compute joint angles from the relative marker positions of the labeled trajectories. These are also used for motion capture in the motion picture industry.|$|E
25|$|When the UV Index is {{presented}} {{on a daily}} basis, it represents UV intensity around the sun's highest point in the day, called solar noon, halfway between sunrise and sunset. This typically occurs between 11:30 and 12:30, or between 12:30 and 13:30 in areas where daylight saving time is being observed. Predictions are made by <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> that accounts {{for the effects of}} sun elevation and distance, stratospheric ozone, cloud conditions, air pollutants, surface albedo, and ground altitude, all of which influence the amount of UV radiation at the surface. The calculations are weighted in favor of the UV wavelengths to which human skin is most sensitive, according to the CIE-standard McKinlay-Diffey erythemal action spectrum. The resulting UV Index cannot be expressed in pure physical units, but is a good indicator of likely sunburn damage.|$|E
25|$|For example, it {{was useful}} {{to examine the}} {{functional}} relationship between TAP peptide transport and HLA class I antigen presentation. TAP is a transmembrane protein responsible for the transport of antigenic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum, where MHC them class I molecules can bind them and presented to T cells. As TAP does not bind all peptides equally, TAP-binding affinity could influence {{the ability of a}} particular peptide {{to gain access to the}} MHC class I pathway. Artificial neural network (ANN), <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> was used to study peptide binding to human TAP and its relationship with MHC class I binding. The affinity of HLA-binding peptides for TAP was found to differ according to the HLA supertype concerned using this method. This research could have important implications for the design of peptide based immuno-therapeutic drugs and vaccines. It shows the power of the modeling approach to understand complex immune interactions.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{idea for the}} [...] "Furnace Trap" [...] came from the house having been a crematorium at some point, but this would have involved turning the house into a funeral parlor, so it was instead decided that the furnace {{would be part of}} the house's boiler system. The furnace was visualized in the form of <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> so that Bousman could better understand how shots could be filmed. Using the computer model as a guide, the furnace was constructed in three days using cement board and tin with removable sides and top so Timothy Burd (Obi) could be filmed crawling inside. The furnace produced real flames and, in place of Burd, a stunt man using a fire-retardant gel crawled into the fire.|$|E
500|$|In 1940, Alfred Romer and Llewellyn Ivor Price {{proposed}} that the sail served a thermoregulatory function, allowing individuals to warm their bodies with the sun's heat. In the following years, many models were created to estimate the effectiveness of thermoregulation in Dimetrodon. For example, in a 1973 article in the journal Nature, paleontologists C.D.Bramwell and P.B.Fellgett estimated that it took a [...] individual about {{one and a half}} hours for its body temperature to rise from [...] In 1986, Steven C. Haack concluded that the warming was slower than previously thought and that the process probably took four hours. Using a model based on a variety of environmental factors and hypothesized physiological aspects of Dimetrodon, Haack found that the sail allowed Dimetrodon to warm faster in the morning and reach a slightly higher body temperature during the day, but that it was ineffective in releasing excess heat and did not allow Dimetrodon to retain a higher body temperature at night. In 1999, a group of mechanical engineers created <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> to analyze the ability of the sail to regulate body temperature during different seasons, and concluded that the sail was beneficial for capturing and releasing heat at all times in the year.|$|E
500|$|He {{opted to}} give the film's animators {{portions}} to animate entirely, rather than the standard process of animating one character, in {{a throwback to the}} way Disney's first features were created. The exception were those responsible for creating the Giant himself, who was created using computer-generated imagery due to the difficulty of creating a metal object [...] "in a fluid-like manner." [...] They had additional trouble with using the computer model to express emotion. The Giant was designed by filmmaker Joe Johnston (best known for designing the Star Wars trilogy), which was refined by production designer Mark Whiting and Steve Markowski, head animator for the Giant. Using software, the team would animate the Giant [...] "on twos" [...] (every other frame, or twelve frames per second) when interacting with other characters, to make it less obvious it was <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>model.</b> Bird brought in students from CalArts to assist in minor animation work due to the film's busy schedule.

500|$|Jack Horner and Don Lessem {{argued in}} 1993 that Tyrannosaurus {{was slow and}} {{probably}} could not run (no airborne phase in mid-stride). However, Holtz (1998) concluded that tyrannosaurids and their close relatives were the fastest large theropods. Christiansen (1998) estimated that the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus were not significantly stronger than those of elephants, which are relatively limited in their top speed and never actually run (there is no airborne phase), and hence proposed that the dinosaur's maximum speed would have been about , {{which is about the}} speed of a human sprinter. Farlow and colleagues (1995) have argued that a 6-8ton Tyrannosaurus would have been critically or even fatally injured if it had fallen while moving quickly, since its torso would have slammed into the ground at a deceleration of 6g (six times the acceleration due to gravity, or about 60meters/s²) and its tiny arms could not have reduced the impact. However, giraffes have been known to gallop at 50km/h (31mph), despite the risk that they might break a leg or worse, which can be fatal even in a [...] "safe" [...] environment such as a zoo. Thus {{it is quite possible that}} Tyrannosaurus also moved fast when necessary and had to accept such risks; this scenario has been studied for Allosaurus too. Most recent research on Tyrannosaurus locomotion does not narrow down speeds further than a range from , i.e. from walking or slow running to moderate-speed running. <b>A</b> <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> study in 2007 estimated running speeds, based on data taken directly from fossils, and claimed that T. rex had a top running speed of [...] (probably a juvenile individual).|$|E
500|$|The animators {{were told}} to make a {{detailed}} replica of the city. David Silverman was sent to Manhattan to take hundreds of pictures {{of the city and}} areas around the World Trade Center. When he returned, Lance Wilder and his team spent time creating new scenes and backgrounds, incorporating small details such as signs and hundreds of extras that would correctly illustrate the city. Oakley and Weinstein were pleased with the final results, and both noted that the buildings, streets, and even elevator cabins were detailed closely to their real life counterparts. In the final scene, as the family is seen driving away from New York on the George Washington Bridge, the credits roll with the [...] "camera" [...] gradually pulling back from a view of the car, to a view of the side, and then on to a panorama view of the city; as if the whole sequence was being shot from a helicopter. To achieve this effect, <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> of the bridge pulling out was made and then printed out. With the print outs, photocopies were made traced onto the animation cels. The process took a long time and was expensive, as the use of computer animation was not widespread when the episode was produced. Director Jim Reardon wanted to replicate films that ended in a similar way, and commented, [...] "I remembered that every movie located in New York would pull back if you were leaving town on a bridge." [...] Shortly before the episode aired, the production staff contacted Fox to make sure they would not run commercials during the credits.|$|E
