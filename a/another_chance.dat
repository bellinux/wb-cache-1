5|$|Arsenal {{scored the}} game's only {{goal in the}} 24th minute; set-up by Walcott, Oxlade-Chamberlain managed to cut inside César Azpilicueta {{on the right and}} shoot the ball into the top-left corner of Courtois's net. It was the first goal Chelsea had conceded against Arsenal in 506 minutes. Most of the action in the first half was {{conducted}} in a congested midfield, with Fàbregas attempting to sedate the rhythm and the Arsenal midfielders forcing their opponents to play narrow. This favoured Arsenal, who had space to counter-attack had Chelsea lost the ball. Ramires nearly levelled the scoreline in the 33rd minute, but his curling effort failed to creep into the bottom right-hand corner. Ramires then missed <b>another</b> <b>chance,</b> heading the ball high and over the Arsenal goal after good work by Rémy. Arsenal created <b>another</b> <b>chance</b> to score four minutes before the break, when Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross found Monreal, who under pressure from Ivanovic headed over. Rémy, often a lone figure upfront, was ruled offside late on.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of extra time Cardiff made their first {{substitution}} of the match, goalscorer Mason was replaced by Filip Kiss. Liverpool had the first chance to score in extra time, but Suárez's header was cleared off the line by Andrew Taylor. Cardiff appeared to be playing for a penalty shoot-out, as they were positioning {{the majority of their}} team behind the ball and in front of their goal. Cardiff captain Hudson was replaced in the 98th minute by Anthony Gerrard after suffering from cramp. Liverpool had <b>another</b> <b>chance</b> in the 101st minute, when a pass by Gerrard was cleared for a corner kick by Taylor. The resulting corner was met by Carroll, but his header was wide of the Cardiff goal. Immediately after the attack Carroll was replaced by Dirk Kuyt. Just {{before the end of the}} first half of extra time Liverpool had <b>another</b> <b>chance.</b> Bellamy went past two men down the left hand side of the pitch before exchanging passes with Kuyt, however his subsequent shot went wide.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff City were rumoured to be {{interested}} in signing Roberts, a fee of £150,000 was mentioned, but a transfer never materialised.

5|$|Liverpool had <b>another</b> <b>chance</b> {{to score}} in the 73rd minute, but Geoff Strong's shot {{following}} a corner went over the crossbar. Ajax extended their lead {{towards the end of}} the half when they counter-attacked and scored courtesy of Groot. Liverpool managed to {{score in the}} last minute through Lawler, but they were unable to score any further goals and lost the match 5–1.|$|E
5|$|São Paulo's {{pressure}} {{resulted in}} them {{taking the lead}} in the 27th minute. A chipped pass from Aloísio to Mineiro found the midfielder in space who put the ball beyond Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina to give the Brazilians a 1–0 lead. It was the first goal Liverpool had conceded in over 1,041 minutes of play. Immediately afterwards, Liverpool had a corner, which almost resulted in a goal. Xabi Alonso took the corner which found García, but his shot hit the woodwork. Liverpool had <b>another</b> <b>chance</b> 30 minutes into the match, but again he failed to score with a header. Gerrard had a chance to equalise five minutes later, but he put his shot wide after Harry Kewell had passed him the ball. Liverpool continued to create chances and in the 39th minute García saw his header into the far corner saved by São Paulo goalkeeper Rogério Ceni. From the resulting corner Liverpool defender Sami Hyypiä shot straight at Ceni. He had <b>another</b> <b>chance</b> late in the first half, but his header was saved by Ceni.|$|E

50|$|Where trains {{encounter}} a different gauge, {{such as at}} the Spanish-French border or the Russian-Chinese one, the traditional solution has always been transloading (often called transshipment in discussions of break of gauge), that is, the transfer of passengers and freight to cars on the other system. When transloading from one gauge to <b>another,</b> <b>chances</b> are that the quantity of rolling stock on each gauge is unbalanced, leading to more idle rolling stock on one gauge than the other. This is obviously far from optimal, {{and a number of}} more efficient schemes have been devised.|$|R

5|$|After 61 {{minutes with}} Bareclona still losing 1-0, Henrik Larsson joined the fray as a Barcelona {{substitute}} for Mark van Bommel. Minutes later, Alexander Hleb received a pass from Henry but shot wide of the goal. Arsenal began to press forward and both Henry and Fredrik Ljungberg saw shots saved; Henry then had <b>another</b> <b>chance</b> to score after being put through by Hleb, but he shot straight at Valdés. Following this attack Oleguer {{was replaced by}} Juliano Belletti, and Arsenal responded by replacing Cesc Fàbregas with Mathieu Flamini.|$|E

5|$|Having {{played the}} final year of his {{existing}} contract, Bieksa addressed his pending unrestricted free agency by telling the media he was ready to re-sign for less than market value in order to remain with the Canucks. Shortly thereafter, on June 27, 2011, Bieksa signed a five-year, $23 million contract extension. The deal came with a no-trade clause and was reported to be front-loaded, with Bieksa making $7 million in his first year, followed by $4.5 million, $5 million, $4 million and $2.5 million annual salaries. The deal kept the popular defenceman amongst the core for <b>another</b> <b>chance</b> at winning a Stanley Cup.|$|E
