50|$|This {{model is}} {{different}} from the other models discovered because it relies only on knowledge of the battery discharge <b>voltage</b> curve and <b>access</b> <b>to</b> battery <b>voltage</b> sensor which is available in all modern Smartphones. The basic idea for this model technique is to use battery state of discharge with running training software programs to control phone component power and activity states. Each individual Smartphone component is held in a specific state for a significant period of time and the change in battery state of discharge is captured using built-in battery voltage sensors. The first challenging idea is <b>to</b> convert battery <b>voltage</b> readings into power consumption. This is determined by state of discharge (which is total consumed energy by battery) variation within a testing interval captured by voltage sensors that will eventually drive the following equation.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{projects}} in the UK have investigated different connection arrangements for managing distributed wind generators to maintain thermal limits {{and a number of}} principle of <b>access</b> for generators <b>to</b> the limited distribution network capacity have been investigated. However, principle of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> manage <b>voltage</b> limits have not received as much attention. This study aims to evaluate the current practice for connecting ‘non-firm’ distributed wind generators under both voltage and thermal constraint conditions. It addresses the issue by developing a representative model of a UK 11 kV radial distribution feeder comprising a mix of urban and rural sections using time-step optimal power flow simulations. The results indicated that when the principle is applied under both network constraint conditions, it can lead to inefficient use of network capacities and reduced renewable energy yields...|$|R
30|$|Data {{assimilation}} is {{a framework}} by {{which one can}} optimally combine measurements and {{a model of a}} system. In neuroscience, depending on the neural system of interest, the data we have may unveil only a small subset of the overall activity of the system. For the results presented here, we used simulated data from the Morris–Lecar model with distinct activity based upon different choices for model parameters.

30|$|Essentially, {{this example}} shows how our {{framework}} transparently virtualizes <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the same <b>voltage</b> sensor. This demonstrates two important {{features of the}} data and control points. First, since the SDG-Pro provides (virtually) exclusive <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the sensors (i.e., buffers act as multiplexers), developers can define custom configurations for the data streams, effectively creating an application-specific view of the sensors. An important consequence is that multiple applications can easily share the infrastructure, retaining a custom view of it. Second, since Data and Control points support developers to interact with underlying devices in a unified manner, i.e., independent of the communication protocols or the input channel types, applications can define their (arbitrarily complex) data models by only specifying the required data points. These {{can be seen as}} volatile fields in traditional data model entities.|$|R

The repetitive power flow and continuation power flow are used <b>to</b> <b>access</b> PV curves through tracing the power flow solutions for the change of loads.

Individual efforts are not only required on the provider’s side, who has to engineer the systems based on the customer’s particular requirements, {{but also on the}} customer’s side, who has to invest into application-specific infrastructure, and who has to prepare the installation location to fulfill technical, legal, and regulatory requirements concerning the system’s operation and safety (e.g., secured sites with <b>access</b> <b>to</b> medium <b>voltage</b> and possibly high voltage grid). In addition, a second life customer needs qualified personnel to monitor and maintain the repurposed battery system and monetize the battery system’s services. Finally, with the complexity of the repurposed battery systems and the number of integrated battery packs also the periodic demand for compatible replacement battery components increases, which is challenging, as the OEMs’ battery technologies might change over time. Consequently, if the used EVBs shall be repurposed for large-scale applications, the presented attributes render a market setting for transaction T 2 unfeasible, since the high relationship-specific investments will not be thoroughly protected.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} circuit-level {{modeling}} approach for the threshold voltage shift in PMOS devices {{due to the}} negative-bias temperature instability (NBTI). The model is suitable forapplication in analog circuit design and reproduces the results of existing digital-stress NBTI models {{in the limit of}} two-level stress signals. It accounts for recovery effects during intervals of low stress, and it predicts a stress-pattern dependent saturation of the degradation at large operation times. Since the model can be solved numerically in an efficient way, we have direct <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the threshold <b>voltage</b> shift at arbitrary times, in particular to the exact solution at large operation times, without any approximation. We implement the model via the Cadence Spectre URI. Finally, we make use of the model to compare the aging properties of several analog stress patterns.

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} is of significant concern in battery operated embedded systems. In the processors of such systems, the instruction cache consumes a significant {{fraction of the}} total energy. One of the most popular methods to reduce the energy {{consumption is}} to shut down idle cache banks. However, we observe that operating idle cache banks at a reduced voltage/frequency level along with the active banks in a pipelined manner can potentially achieve even better energy savings. In this paper, we propose a novel DVS-based pipelined reconfigurable instruction memory hierarchy called PRIM. A canonical example of our proposed PRIM consists of four cache banks. Two of these cache banks can be configured at runtime to operate at lower voltage and frequency levels than that of the normal cache. Instruction fetch throughput is maintained by pipelining the <b>accesses</b> <b>to</b> the low <b>voltage</b> banks. We developed a profiledriven compilation framework that analyzes applications and inserts the appropriate cache reconfiguration points. Our experimental results show that PRIM can significant reduce the energy consumption for popular embedded benchmarks with minimal performance overhead. We obtained 56. 6 % and 45. 1 % energy savings for aggressive and conservative VDD settings, respectively, at the expense of a 1. 66 % performance overhead...|$|R
40|$|This Dzero Engineering note {{describes}} the method {{for which the}} 2 Tesla Superconducting Solenoid Fast Dump and Slow Dump data are accumulated, tracked and stored. The 2 Tesla Solenoid has eleven data points {{that need to be}} tracked and then stored when a fast dump or a slow dump occur. The TI 555 (Texas Instruments) PLC(Programmable Logic Controller) which controls the DC power circuit that powers the Solenoid, also has <b>access</b> <b>to</b> all the <b>voltage</b> taps and other equipment in the circuit. The TI 555 constantly logs these eleven points in a rotating memory buffer. When either a fast dump(dump switch opens) or a slow dump (power supply turns off) occurs, the TI 555 organizes the respective data and will down load the data to a file on DO-CCRS 2. This data in this file is moved over ethernet and is stored in a CSV (comma separated format) file which can easily be examined by Microsoft Excel or any other spreadsheet. The 2 Tesla solenoid control system also locks in first fault information. The TI 555 decodes the first fault and passes it along to the program collecting the data and storing it on DO-CCRS 2.

40|$|A {{high gain}} {{operating}} regime for a frequency <b>to</b> <b>voltage</b> converter is analyzed. Such kind of regime {{is useful to}} detect very low variations of a signal frequency. Another possible application is as a marker generator for the sweep low frequency oscillators. The converter gain is theoretically calculated and compared with experimental results. Key words: frequency <b>to</b> <b>voltage</b> converter, frequency comparator, frequency demodulation. In order to observe certain physical effects {{it is necessary to}} demodulate a frequency-modulated signal (e. g. NQR effect [1], RFSE effect [2], various biophysical applications [3], etc). In this purpose, there are many possible methods. Due to its simplicity, the frequency <b>to</b> <b>voltage</b> converter {{is one of the most}} widespread. Frequency <b>to</b> <b>voltage</b> converter provides <b>to</b> its output a voltage U 0 proportional to the input signal frequency ν. Although frequency <b>to</b> <b>voltage</b> converters are not as accurate as the frequency counter circuits, they remain useful in many applications. This is the case where it is required to record only the variations of a signal frequency but it is not necessary to know very precisely the signal frequency. In this paper, we propose a new operating regime for frequency <b>to</b> <b>voltage</b> converter used as a frequency comparator. Such a regime can be useful in order to detect very low variations of a signal frequency. Generally, a frequency <b>to</b> <b>voltage</b> converter must accomplish two main requirements: – Output voltage versus input signal frequency to be linear – Converter gain K=∆U 0 /∆ν to be as high as possible...|$|R
