40|$|ABSTRACT: In the {{reliability}} analysis of safety critical complex engineering structures {{a very large}} number of the system parameters can be considered to be random variables. The difficulty in computing the failure prob-ability using the classical First and Second-Order Reliability Methods (FORM and SORM) increases rapidly with the number of variables or ‘dimension’. There are mainly two reasons behind this. The first is the increase in computational time with the increase in the number of random variables. In principle this problem can be handled with superior computational tools. The second, which is perhaps more fundamental, is that there are some conceptual difficulties associated typically with high dimensions. This means that even one manages to carry out the necessary computations, the application of existing FORM and SORM may still lead to incorrect results in high dimensions. This paper is aimed at addressing this issue. Based on the asymptotic distribution of quadratic form in Gaussian random variables, two formulations for the case when the number of random variables n → ∞ is provided. The first is called strict <b>asymptotic</b> <b>formulation</b> and the second is called weak <b>asymptotic</b> <b>formulation.</b> Both approximations results in simple closed-form expressions for the probability of failure of an engineering structure. The proposed asymptotic approximations are compared with existing approximations and Monte Carlo simulations using numerical examples. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} rate of {{convergence}} of the Lasso estimator of lower dimensional components of the high-dimensional parameter. Under bounds on the $\ell_ 1 $-norm on the worst possible sub-direction these rates are of order $\sqrt {|J| \log p / n }$ where $p$ is {{the total number of}} parameters, $J \subset \{ 1, \ldots, p \}$ represents a subset of the parameters and $n$ is the number of observations. We also derive rates in sup-norm in terms of {{the rate of}} convergence in $\ell_ 1 $-norm. The irrepresentable condition on a set $J$ requires that the $\ell_ 1 $-norm of the worst possible sub-direction is sufficiently smaller than one. In that case sharp oracle results can be obtained. Moreover, if the coefficients in $J$ are small enough the Lasso will put these coefficients to zero. This extends known results which say that the irrepresentable condition on the inactive set (the set where coefficients are exactly zero) implies no false positives. We further show that by de-sparsifying one obtains fast rates in supremum norm without conditions on the worst possible sub-direction. The main assumption here is that approximate sparsity is of order $o (\sqrt n / \log p) $. The results are extended to M-estimation with $\ell_ 1 $-penalty for generalized linear models and exponential families for example. For the graphical Lasso this leads to an extension of known results to the case where the precision matrix is only approximately sparse.

40|$|Flame {{instability}} is both {{important and}} difficult to understand. Mechanisms of instability are complex, because instability often involves an interaction between several different physical phenomena, such as an unsteady chemical reaction, unsteady flame propagation generating an unsteady flow, acoustic waves or shock waves. So, {{it is difficult to}} control these instabilities in combustion systems. Research on combustion instability will promote understanding and provide some rational approaches to the anticipation, prevention, remedy and utilization of unstable combustion. The investigations in this thesis focus on some nonlinear effects of fundamental importance to combustion theory, flame propagation and stretch effects, shock-induced flame-front instability and tulip flame instability by using experimental and theoretical tools. The main goals of this thesis are to study the intrinsic characteristics of flame instability, to describe the mechanisms of instability, and to derive some <b>asymptotic</b> <b>formulations</b> to quantitatively predict the processes of unstable flame development and it final stage. In order to study this process, a level set technique accounting for heat release effects and flame propagation is adopted together with N. S and Euler equations to track the evolution of the flame front in nonlinear hydrodynamic and shock-induced flame instability for 2 D and 3 D cases. The Schlieren technique is used for experimental visualization of the processes of tulip flame formation. It was found that tulip flame formation and shock-induced flame-front instability are due to the vorticity generated by the misalignment of density and pressure gradients in the systems. The initial inversion of the flame-front is due to the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability. Results also show that the flame propagation speed of a perturbed flame is asymptotically equal to Up=(1 + 0. 293 *sqrt(d- 1)) *sl, where d is the density ratio and sl is the laminar burning speed and the asymptotic amplitude of the flame is approximately A= 0. 37 *L*sqrt(d- 1), where L is the flame wave-length. The burning velocity has a minor effect on the asymptotic shape of the flames. When the turbulence scale is much smaller than the size of the combustion apparatus the results can be directly applied to turbulent flames by replacing sl with the turbulent burning velocity...|$|R
