5|$|The Cold War {{split the}} {{temporary}} wartime alliance against Nazi Germany, leaving the Soviet Union and the United States as two superpowers with profound {{economic and political}} differences. The USSR was a Marxist–Leninist state led by its Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which in turn was dominated by a leader with different titles over time, and a small committee called the Politburo. The Party controlled the press, the military, the economy and many organizations. It also controlled the other states in the Eastern Bloc, and funded Communist parties around the world, sometimes in competition with Communist China, particularly following the Sino-Soviet split of the 1960s. In opposition stood the capitalist West, led by the United States, a federal republic with a two-party presidential system. The First World nations of the Western Bloc were generally democratic with <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>press</b> and independent organizations, but were economically and politically entwined with a network of banana republics and other authoritarian regimes throughout the Third World, {{most of which were}} the Western Bloc's former colonies. Some major Cold War frontlines such as Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Congo were still Western colonies in 1947.|$|E

Others wished to prove their independence from the government, which had controlled the press under Fujimori. Ironically, it was Toledo's commitment to maintaining <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>press</b> that allowed these attacks to occur.|$|E

25|$|By {{reporting}} {{ongoing and}} often unfinished scientific work that may otherwise {{have not been}} reported, the journal had a central function of being a scientific news service.

25|$|Dato Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi freed Anwar, {{which was}} seen as a portent of a mild liberalisation. At the 2004 election, the National Front led by Abdullah had a massive victory, {{virtually}} wiping out the PAS and Keadilan, although the DAP recovered the seats it had lost in 1999. This victory {{was seen as}} the result mainly of Abdullah's personal popularity and the strong recovery of Malaysia’s economy, which has lifted the living standards of most Malaysians to almost first world standards, coupled with an ineffective opposition. The government's objective is for Malaysia to become a fully developed country by 2020 as expressed in Wawasan 2020. It leaves unanswered, however, the question of when and how Malaysia will acquire a first world political system (a multi-party democracy, <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>press,</b> an independent judiciary and the restoration of civil and political liberties) to go with its new economic maturity.|$|E
25|$|Salomon {{realised}} {{that his}} nephew had no talent for trade {{and it was}} decided that Heine should enter the law. So, in 1819, Heine went to the University of Bonn (then in Prussia). Political life in Germany was divided between conservatives and liberals. The conservatives, who were in power, wanted to restore things to the way they were before the French Revolution. They were against German unification because they felt a united Germany might fall victim to revolutionary ideas. Most German states were absolutist monarchies with a censored press. The opponents of the conservatives, the liberals, wanted to replace absolutism with representative, constitutional government, equality before the law and <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>press.</b> At the University of Bonn, liberal students were at war with the conservative authorities. Heine was a radical liberal {{and one of the first}} things he did after his arrival was to take part in a parade which violated the Carlsbad Decrees, a series of measures introduced by Metternich to suppress liberal political activity.|$|E

500|$|Wollstonecraft spends {{several large}} {{sections}} of Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark speculating about the possibilities {{of social and political}} revolution and outlining a trajectory for the progress of civilization. In comparing Norway with Britain and France, for example, she argues that the Norwegians are more progressive because they have <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>press,</b> embrace religious toleration, distribute their land fairly, and have a politically active populace. However, her description of Norway's [...] "golden age" [...] becomes less rhapsodic after she discovers that the country has no universities or scientists.|$|E
500|$|Concerns that {{defamation}} under {{common law}} might be {{incompatible with the}} new republican form of government caused early American courts to struggle between William Blackstone's argument that the punishment of [...] "dangerous or offensive writings [...] [...] [...] [...] necessary {{for the preservation of}} peace and good order, of government and religion, the only solid foundations of civil liberty" [...] and the argument that the need for <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>press</b> guaranteed by the Constitution outweighed the fear of what might be written.

500|$|In March 1980, FSLN signed several accords {{with the}} Soviet Union causing the US President, Jimmy Carter, who had {{initially}} authorized {{aid to the}} Sandinista government, to approve CIA support for the opposition forces. On 19 April 1980, Chamorro resigned from the Junta {{in opposition to the}} Sandinista's push for control, implementation of a Cuban interpretation of Marx, and failure to keep the commitments made in Puntarenas, Costa Rica for establishment of a democracy. Her exit prompted other members of the Junta to resign and join opposition groups that were beginning to form. She returned to her role as editor of La Prensa, driving it to become both an advocate of free speech and opposition thought. Her support of the Contras caused divisions in her own family and resulted in La Prensas offices being temporarily shut down on several occasions. In 1986, President Ortega even threatened her personally with a thirty-year prison sentence for treason. That same year, she won the Louis Lyons Award from the Nieman Foundation at Harvard University; the award citation said that she had [...] "resisted repression and censorship" [...] and remained dedicated to <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>press</b> despite threats, redactions and suppression by the government.|$|E
500|$|The Brazilian Empire was admired internationally for its {{democratic}} system {{and for its}} respect for freedom of speech. In politics there were [...] "solid and competitive parties, an active parliament, <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>press,</b> open debate". The Argentine President Bartolomé Mitre called the country a [...] "crowned democracy" [...] and Venezuelan President Rojas Paúl after learning of the Emperor's fall said, [...] "It has ended the only republic that existed in [...] America: the Empire of Brazil." [...] The Brazil {{of the last year}} of Pedro II's reign was a [...] "prosperous and [...] respected" [...] nation which held unchallenged leadership in Latin America. Its navy was the fifth or sixth most powerful in the world in 1889 with the most powerful battleships in the western hemisphere. The Emperor was beloved by the Brazilian people and was regarded with [...] "respect, almost veneration" [...] in North America and Europe due to his democratic, liberal and progressive ideals and actions.

500|$|Members of Ferraro's {{family were}} indeed facing legal issues.

Then in , he was indicted on unrelated felony charges regarding an alleged 1981 bribery of Queens Borough President Donald Manes concerning a cable television contract. A full year later, he was acquitted at trial. The case against him was circumstantial, a key prosecution witness proved unreliable, and the defense {{did not have to}} present its own testimony. Ferraro said her husband never would have been charged had she not run for vice president. Meanwhile, in , the couple's son John had been arrested for possession and sale of cocaine. He was convicted, and in , sentenced to four months imprisonment; Ferraro broke down in tears in court relating the stress the episode had placed on her family. Ferraro worked on an unpublished book about the conflicting rights between <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>press</b> and being able to have fair trials. Asked in , whether she would have accepted the vice-presidential nomination had she known of all the family problems that would follow, she said, [...] "More than once I have sat down and said to myself, oh, God, I wish I had never gone through with it...
