40|$|Online {{publishers}} rely on real-time bidding (RTB) {{markets to}} sell their remnant inventory and increasingly to command higher prices for “premium ” content. However, content providers have lagged advertisers historically in the sophistication of their pricing models, {{as evidenced by the}} large increase in demand-side platforms without corresponding investment on the sell-side. Informed advertisers collect user-intent and demographic information in addition to the publisher context in order to score the relevance of impressions. The resulting differential impression pricing is only visible to publishers as a positive externality to revenue unless they collect the same audience targeting information. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian hierarchical model of <b>auction</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>price</b> that can naturally account for the presence of publisher-advertiser information asymmetry and quantify its impact on price. Although the current model is simply exploratory, it suggests that richer models of dynamic floor pricing may improve publisher revenue. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the literature on market power in emissions permits markets, modeling an emissions trading scheme in which polluters differ with respect to their marginal abatement costs at the business-as-usual emissions. The polluters play a two-stage static complete information game in which their market power arises endogenously from their characteristics. In the first stage all polluters bid in an auction for the distribution of the fixed supply of permits issued by the regulator, and in the second stage they trade these permits in a secondary market. For compliance, they can also engage in abatement activity at a quadratic cost. Under the assumptions of the model, in equilibrium all polluters are successful in the auction. In the secondary market the low-cost emitters are net sellers and the high-cost emitters are net buyers. Moreover, the high-cost emitters are worse off {{as a result of the}} strategic behavior. In addition, the secondary market price is unambiguously above the <b>auction</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>price.</b> I find that the aggregate compliance cost when polluters act strategically increases in the heterogeneity of their marginal abatement costs at the business-as-usual emissions, but there exists a threshold of the fixed supply of permits above which strategic behavior is compliance cost-saving for the polluters. Finally, for a low enough variance of the marginal abatement cost at the business-as-usual emissions, strategic behavior is compliance cost-saving for the polluters, regardless of the level of the available supply of permits...|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} from the New York ISO shows that the <b>clearing</b> <b>prices</b> for point-to-point congestion revenue rights, also known as financial transmission rights (FTRs), resulting from centralized auctions conducted by Independent System Operators differ significantly and systematically from the realized congestion revenues that determine the accrued payoffs of these rights. The question addressed by this paper is whether such deviations are due to price discovery errors which will eventually vanish or due to inherent inefficiencies in the auction structure. We show that even with perfect foresight of average congestion rents the <b>clearing</b> <b>prices</b> for the FTRs depend on the bid quantity and therefore may not be priced correctly in the financial transmission right (FTR) auction. In particular, we prove that quantity limits on the FTR bids may cause the <b>auction</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>prices</b> to differ from the bid prices. This phenomenon which {{is inherent in the}} theoretical properties of the optimization algorithm used to <b>clear</b> the <b>auction,</b> is further illustrated through numerical simulations with test systems. We conclude that price discovery alone would not remedy the discrepancy between the auction prices and the realized values of the FTRs. Secondary markets or frequent reconfiguration auctions are necessary in order to achieve such convergence.

In the reverse auction, broadcasters compete to repurpose television broadcast spectrum for mobile broadband use.

Prices are announced (perhaps by an [...] "auctioneer"), and agents state how much of each good they would like to offer (supply) or purchase (demand). No transactions and no production take place at disequilibrium prices. Instead, prices are lowered for goods with above-equilibrium prices and excess supply. Prices are raised for goods with excess demand. The question for the mathematician is under what conditions such a process will terminate in an equilibrium in which demand equals supply for goods with positive prices and demand does not exceed supply for goods with a price of zero. Walras was not able to provide a definitive answer to this question.|$|R

40|$|The single clearing-price auction {{is perhaps}} the most basic {{building}} block of markets. Buyers submit demand bids and sellers submit supply offers. The auctioneer then forms the aggregate supply and demand curves, and finds the <b>clearing</b> <b>price</b> at which supply and demand balance; that is, where the supply and demand curves cross. All demand bids above the <b>clearing</b> <b>price</b> and all supply offers below the <b>clearing</b> <b>price</b> are accepted. The winning buyers pay the <b>clearing</b> <b>price</b> and the winning sellers are paid the <b>clearing</b> <b>price</b> for their accepted quantities. The single clearing-price auction is important because of its simplicity and effectiveness at answering the most basic questions: who should get the goods, who should produce the goods, and at what prices. Based on each market participant’s expressed preference, the single clearing-price auction awards the goods to all consumers who value the goods more than the cost (the <b>clearing</b> <b>price)</b> and the goods are produced by all suppliers who have a cost less than their payment (the <b>clearing</b> <b>price).</b> In this way, the clearing-price auction maximizes gains from trade: consumption comes from demand with the highest values and production comes from supply with the lowest cost. This {{is perhaps the}} most celebrated result in economics. It should be no surprise that the single clearing-price auction is the centerpiece of restructured electricity markets. Most electricity systems use the single clearing-price auction in many places. The most important application is the spot energy market, which is a real-time market to determine the price of electricity at a particular time and location...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a dynamic market model where {{buyers and sellers}} submit limit orders. If at a given moment in time, the buyer is unable to complete his entire order due to the shortage of sell orders at the required limit price, the unmatched part of the order is recorded in the order book. Subsequently these buy unmatched orders may be matched with new incoming sell orders. The resulting demand curve constitutes the sole input to our model. The <b>clearing</b> <b>price</b> is then mechanically calculated using the market clearing condition. We model liquidity by considering {{the impact of a}} large trader on the market and on the <b>clearing</b> <b>price.</b> We assume a continuous model for the demand curve. We show that generically there exists an equivalent martingale measure for the <b>clearing</b> <b>price,</b> for all possible strategies of the large trader, if the driving noise is a Brownian sheet, while there may not be if the driving noise is multidimensional Brownian motion. Another contribution {{of this paper is to}} prove that, if there exists such an equivalent martingale measure, then, under mild conditions, there is no arbitrage. We use the Ito-Wentzell formula to obtain both results. We also characterize the dynamics of the demand curve and of the <b>clearing</b> <b>price</b> in the equivalent martingale measure. We find that the volatility of the <b>clearing</b> <b>price</b> is inversely proportional to the sum of buy and sell order flow density (evaluated at the <b>clearing</b> <b>price),</b> which confirms the intuition that volatility is inversely proportional to volume. We also demonstrate that our approach is implementable. We use real order book data and simulate option prices under a particularly simple parameterization of our model. The no-arbitrage conditions we obtain are applicable to a wide class of models, in the same way that the Heath-Jarrow-Morton conditions apply to a wide class of interest rate models.
