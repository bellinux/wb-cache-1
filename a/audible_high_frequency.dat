40|$|This thesis {{claims a}} {{relationship}} between the film splitting sound emission from the printing press nip and the dynamic interaction occurring there between ink, fountain solution and substrate in offset lithography. The film splitting sound derives from the cavitation formed by the pressure drop {{in the second half of}} the print nip flow passage. As the ink film is strained, the cavities expand and eventually implode into breaking filaments at the nip exit, while emitting a partly <b>audible,</b> broadband, <b>high</b> <b>frequency,</b> noisy sound. A free-field microphone, A/D-converter and laptop computer were used to record pressure signals in the frequency range of 10 Hz to 50 kHz emitted by a variety of printing instruments and presses for a range of offset ink and paper types. After signal acquisition and filtering two signal averages of power and frequency were estimated. This average power increased with increasing loads of sheet-fed offset ink on an ink distributor, in accordance with a mass-conservation model developed. The behaviour of average frequency and power over different ink load ranges indicated transitions between different flow regimes. A glossy fine-coated paper gave higher average power than a corresponding matte paper during printing with such inks on a laboratory device, possibly due to an air sealing effect. The sound from tack measurements with the Deltack instrument during setting of heat-set offset inks printed on MWC papers showed a relation between the measured tack rise and average power, reflecting changes in splitting mechanism during the course of setting. With the Hydroscope instrument the interaction between these heat-set inks and fountain solution was studied, with the measured tack and sound emission displaying a clear, but non-linear, correlation. A heat-set offset pilot trial showed that the acoustic response from the printing nip sensitively and systematically detected changes in (LWC) paper type, optical density, ink-fount balance, and press stability. Pilot trials of cold-set offset inks on newsprint by sheet-fed presses indicated a strong correlation between evolution in average power, optical density and fountain solution consumption during the first thousand sheets normally needed for stabilisation. Acoustic measurements of ink film splitting have, aside from the laboratory studies performed by one Japanese group, previously received little attention, with the current study showing that a great deal of information useful to the printer can be accessed from this sound emission. Although the detailed mechanisms for ink film splitting have to be further studied and supported by mathematical simulation, the sensitivity of the acoustic method recommends its implementation for monitoring and control of offset printing.

40|$|Listeners can {{perceive}} interleaved {{sequences of}} sounds from {{two or more}} sources as segregated streams. In humans, physical separation of sound sources {{is a major factor}} enabling such stream segregation. Here, we examine spatial stream segregation with a psychophysical measure in domestic cats. Cats depressed a pedal to initiate a target sequence of brief sound bursts in a particular rhythm and then released the pedal when the rhythm changed. The target bursts were interleaved with a competing sequence of bursts that could differ in source location but otherwise were identical to the target bursts. This task was possible only when the sources were heard as segregated streams. When the sound bursts had broad spectra, cats could detect the rhythm change when target and competing sources were separated by as little as 9. 4 °. Essentially equal levels of performance were observed when frequencies were restricted to a high, 4 -to- 25 -kHz, band in which the principal spatial cues presumably were related to sound levels. When the stimulus band was restricted from 0. 4 to 1. 6  kHz, leaving interaural time differences as the principal spatial cue, performance was severely degraded. The frequency sensitivity of cats in this task contrasts with that of humans, who show better spatial stream segregation with low- than with high-frequency sounds. Possible explanations for the species difference includes the smaller interaural delays available to cats due to smaller sizes of their heads and the potentially greater sound-level cues available due to the cat's frontally directed pinnae and <b>higher</b> <b>audible</b> <b>frequency</b> range...|$|R

Analysis of the vector magnitude in the temporal domain (25 to 250 Hz bandpass filters) measured <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> QRS duration, the duration of terminal signals 25 Hz that were < 40 μV. Analysis in the frequency domain used a 120 ms window that encompassed (had onset with) all of the late potential, but the mean value was first subtracted to eliminate a direct current component. <b>High</b> <b>frequency</b> spectral areas (60 to 120 Hz) and the percent <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> (100 × [60 to 120 Hz/ 0 to 120 Hz]) were calculated. Results in both temporal and frequency domains were similar in control patients with coronary artery disease and normal subjects. Patients with ventricular tachycardia had a longer <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> QRS complex (p < 0. 0001) and longer <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> terminal signals < 40 μV (p < 0. 0004), but not significantly lower voltage in the last 40 ms. The most useful temporal domain measurement was <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> QRS duration (if ≥ 120 ms, odds ratio = 8. 2). Patients with ventricular tachycardia had increased <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> spectral areas (p < 0. 0002) in the late potential, and the percent <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> was especially increased (p = 0. 0000; if percent <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> ≥ 3. 1 %, odds ratio = 18. 4).

40|$|International audienceThe {{prediction}} of acoustical properties of multilayered systems including poroelastic layers using the full Biot theory is in principle possible {{but in practice}} limited {{by the absence of}} material data. One of the parameters that is difficult to measure is the dynamic rigidity of the porous frame. Current experimental methods are limited to {{the lower part of the}} audible frequency range 1 (typically below 400 Hz) and require special shapes of the sample (cube, cylindrical rod or very thin samples). Since most sound absorbing plastic foams are viscoelastic, the elastic moduli may vary strongly with frequency, a measuring technique in the full audible frequency range is needed. Recently 2 a new method for the measurement of the dynamic shear modulus of the frame of poroelastic foams in the medium and <b>high</b> <b>audible</b> <b>frequency</b> range (1 to 4 kHz) has been presented This method is based on the measurement of the velocity and the damping of a Rayleigh-type surface wave on sample with thickness larger than the Rayleigh wave penetration depth. The Rayleigh wave was excited through direct mechanical excitation of the frame or the porous material and detected using a laser-doppler vibrometer. The velocity of this wave is closely related to the shear velocity, which is directly linked to the shear modulus. The damping of the Rayleigh wave can be used to determine the imaginary part of the shear modulus. In this work a first attempt is made to measure the dynamic shear modulus on a layer of finite thickness. In this way there is no requirement whatsoever concerning the shape of the sample under investigation...|$|R
