5000|$|By linearly perturbing the {{equations}} defining the mechanical equilibrium {{of a star}} (i.e. mass conservation and hydrostatic equilibrium) and assuming that the perturbations are adiabatic, one can derive a system of four differential equations whose solutions give the frequency and structure of a star's modes of oscillation. The stellar structure is usually assumed to be spherically symmetric, so the horizontal (i.e. non-radial) component of the oscillations is described by spherical harmonics, indexed by an <b>angular</b> <b>degree</b> [...] and azimuthal order [...] In non-rotating stars, modes with the same <b>angular</b> <b>degree</b> must {{all have the same}} frequency because there is no preferred axis. The <b>angular</b> <b>degree</b> indicates the number of nodal lines on the stellar surface, so for large values of , the opposing sectors roughly cancel out, making it difficult to detect light variations. As a consequence, modes can only be detected up to an <b>angular</b> <b>degree</b> of about 3 in intensity and about 4 if observed in radial velocity.|$|E

5000|$|The {{peak of the}} {{oscillation}} power roughly {{corresponds to}} lower frequencies and radial orders for larger stars. For the Sun, the highest amplitude modes occur around a frequency of 3 mHz with order , and no mixed modes are observed. For more massive and more evolved stars, the modes are of lower radial order and overall lower frequencies. Mixed modes {{can be seen in}} the evolved stars. In principle, such mixed modes may also be present in main-sequence stars but they are at too low frequency to be excited to observable amplitudes. High-order pressure modes of a given <b>angular</b> <b>degree</b> [...] are expected to be roughly evenly-spaced in frequency, with a characteristic spacing known as the large separation [...] [...] This motivates the echelle diagram, in which the mode frequencies are plotted as a function of the frequency modulo the large separation, and modes of a particular <b>angular</b> <b>degree</b> form roughly vertical ridges.|$|E
30|$|Therefore, in {{the present}} work, the {{efficiency}} of blocking the nonspecific adsorption sites by gelatin was investigated. The first injection of gelatin into the measuring flow cell caused a very big (~ 0.3 <b>angular</b> <b>degrees)</b> sensor response. Washing the measuring cell with PBS led to a small signal reduction (reflecting a relatively small portion of weakly adsorbed molecules compared with strongly immobilized ones). Each following injections gave a gradually decreasing increment of the sensor response, and four consecutive injections of gelatin were necessary to get the saturation of the sensor response (~ 0.33 <b>angular</b> <b>degrees)</b> (Fig.  2, green).

40|$|We {{study the}} {{restoration}} of spontaneously broken symmetry at nonzero temperature {{in the framework of}} the O(2) model using polar coordinates. We apply the CJT formalism to calculate the masses and the condensate in the double-bubble approximation, both with and without a term that explicitly breaks the O(2) symmetry. We find that, in the case with explicitly broken symmetry, the mass of the <b>angular</b> <b>degree</b> of freedom becomes tachyonic above a temperature of about 300 MeV. Taking the term that explicitly breaks the symmetry to be infinitesimally small, we find that the Goldstone theorem is respected below the critical temperature. However, this limit cannot be performed for temperatures above the phase transition. We find that, no matter whether we break the symmetry explicitly or not, there is no region of temperature in which the radial and the <b>angular</b> <b>degree</b> of freedom become degenerate in mass. These results hold also when the mass of the radial mode is sent to infinity. Comment: 23 pages, 10 figure...|$|E
40|$|Asteroseismology, which {{consists}} in measuring properties of p-mode oscillations, provides a unique tool for studying stellar interiors. Recently p modes {{have been detected}} on the bright solar-like star α Cen A thanks to high- precision radial- velocity measurements. However a better characterization of p modes is clearly needed to constrain theoretical models. We observed α Cen A during five nights using the high precision spectrograph HARPS {{in order to improve}} our knowledge of the seismic properties of this star and to investigate its mode lifetimes and rotational splitting. We obtained high- precision radial- velocity sequences and computed the acoustic spectrum of α Cen A. We estimate the scatter in the frequencies for each <b>angular</b> <b>degree</b> (ℓ) and analyse it to constrain the rotational splitting and mode lifetimes. We identify 34 p modes with <b>angular</b> <b>degree</b> ℓ = 0 - 3 in the frequency range 1. 8 - 2. 9 mHz and amplitude range 13 - 4 8 cms, in agreement with the previous seismic studies. We find a clear enhancement of the frequency scatter with the <b>angular</b> <b>degree</b> (ℓ), which indicates rotational splitting and explains the low value of mode lifetimes previously suggested by Kjeldsen et al. (2005). Combining all of the existing seismic measurements, we determine a mode lifetime of days and a rotational rate. We also derive new values for the small separations that take into account the effect of rotational splitting. Our seismic study of α Cen A leads to a list of now well- identified p-mode frequencies and shows the importance of taking into account the rotation in order to properly characterize the p modes even for quite short campaigns...|$|E
