40|$|A {{multilayered}} dielectric structure, namely a {{one dimensional}} photonic crystal (1 DPC), is proposed as a suitable platform for photon management, {{due to the}} low absorption of the dielectric materials. When properly designed, a 1 DPC can sustain surface electromagnetic modes called Bloch Surface Waves (BSWs). In this PhD Thesis it is shown how light coupled to BSW can be focused or guided by means of ultrathin polymeric refractive structures directly patterned on the surface. Moreover, by patterning the surface with surface relief gratings, far-field radiation can be efficiently coupled to the surface modes, thus providing an enhanced electromagnetic field at the truncation interface of the 1 DPC. By shaping the grating in a circular symmetry, light can be in-plane focused into a sub-wavelength spot. The same structure {{can be used to}} re-shape the radiation pattern of dipolar emitters. It is shown that an emitter lying {{on the surface of the}} 1 DPC couples to the photonic structure and the fluorescence radiated couple with the surface modes.

The amino-acid substitution model, Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) (Jones et al., 1992), was choosen using ModelGenerator (Keane et al., 2006). Maximum likelihood (ML) analyses were performed with PHYML using the JTT model, the frequencies of amino acids being estimated from the data set, and rate heterogeneity across sites being modelled by two rate categories (one constant and eight gamma-rates). Statistical support for the different internal branches was assessed by bootstrap resampling (100 bootstrap replicates), as implemented in PHYML. Baysian inference was performed using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method as implemented in the MRBAYES package (version 3) (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001; Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003), using the JTT model, with among-sites rate variation modelled by means of a discrete gamma distribution with four equally probable categories.

40|$|Das Ziel der Arbeit war die Suche nach neuen Epoxidhydrolasen (EC 3. 3. 2. 3), die in rekombinanter Form als Biokatalysatoren {{verwendet}} werden können. Die Suche nach neuen Epoxidhydrolaseaktivitäten kann auf zwei Wegen erfolgen. Datenbanken, wie z. B. "GenBank", können auf DNA oder Protein Ebene durch Sequenzvergleiche mit Programmen, wie z. B. BLAST nach Sequenzen durchsucht werden, die bekannten Epoxidhydrolasen ähnlich sind. Im umgekehrten Fall kann eine unbekannte, aus einem Organismus isolierte Sequenz mit anderen verglichen werden und so die putative Funktion bestimmt werden. Im ersten Teil der Arbeit wurden drei putative Epoxidhydrolasen aus B. subtilis, C. glutamicum und M. charantia, die durch Sequenzvergleiche identifiziert wurden, untersucht. Durch die Analyse der Proteinsequenz kann nicht auf die Substratspezifität rückgeschlossen werden, deshalb musste die Funktionalität mit mehreren Epoxiden getestet werden. Dafür wurden zwei Produktnachweise in Mikrotiterplatten für vicinale Diole entwickelt. Der PSS (Periodatspaltung und Färbung mit Schiffschem Reagenz) und PSC (Periodatspaltung und Detektion mit Carboxyfluorescein) Assay. Mit dem PSS-Assay wurden die Produkte einer Periodatspaltung mit Pararosanilin in einer Farbreaktion nachgewiesen. Der PSS-Assay erlaubt den direkten Nachweis der 1, 2 -Diole in wässriger Lösung in Gegenwart von Zelllysaten. Der PSS-Test wurde mit vier Substrat/Produkt Kombinationen validiert. In allen Fällen konnte ein Diolgehalt von mindestens 5 µmol/ml sicher detektiert werden. Die Standardfehler lagen unter 8 %. Mit dem PSC-Assay wurde das nach der Spaltung verbliebene Periodat mit Carboxyfluorescein nachgewiesen. Der PSC-Assay wurde mit sieben verschiedenen Epoxiden und ihren korrespondierenden 1, 2 -Diolen validiert und es konnten Standardfehler von unter 4 % und ein Detektionslimit von < 1 µmol/ml bestimmt werden. Somit ist der PSC Test zum Variantenscreening geeignet. Mit diesen beiden Assaysystemen wurden die drei obengenannten, rekombinant in E. coli produzierten, Epoxidhydrolasen untersucht. Dabei konnte keine Epoxidhydrolaseaktivität gegen alle getesteten Epoxide nachgewiesen werden. L(+) -Weinsäure wird in einem Maßstab von 30000 t/a bei Preisen von 5 €/kg vorwiegend aus Rückständen der Weinerzeugung hergestellt. Die sich daraus ergebenden starken jahreszeitlichen Schwankungen machen eine von Naturstoff unabhängigen Zugang zu L(+) -Weinsäure attraktiv. R. ruber DSM 44319 ist in der Lage cis- 2, 3 -Oxirandicarbonsäure zu L(+) -Weinsäure zu hydrolysieren. Das für die Hydrolyse von cis- 2, 3 -Oxirandicarbonsäure verantwortliche Enzym wurde aus R. ruber DSM 44319 durch eine mehrstufige Aufreinigung mit einem Reinigungsfaktor von rund 450 isoliert. Das aufgereinigte Protein wurde charakterisiert und die Teile der Proteinsequenz bestimmt. Mit diesen Fragmenten konnte bei einer Datenbanksuche in den US Patenten eine Hydrolase aus R. rhodochrous LMPG- 18079 gefunden werden, die dieselbe Reaktion katalysiert. Es konnte nachgewiesen werden, dass die patentierte Protein- und DNA-Sequenz aus R. rhodochrous LMPG- 18079 und R. ruber DSM 44319 identisch sind. Proteinsequenzvergleiche zwischen der R. ruber Sequenz mit bekannten Epoxidhydrolasen zeigten keine Ähnlichkeit. Jedoch zeigt diese Sequenz eine hohe Ähnlichkeit mit vielen Halogencarbonsäure Dehalogenasen. Damit konnte gezeigt werden, dass die Hydrolase aufgrund ihrer Proteinsequenz als Halogencarbonsäure Dehalogenase (EC 3. 8. 1. 5) einzustufen ist, obwohl sie in ihrer Funktionalität einer Epoxidhydrolase entspricht. The aim of {{this work}} was the screening for new epoxide hydrolases {{which can be used}} for biocatalytic purposes. In {{the first part of this}} work three putative epoxide hydrolases from Bacillus subtilis 168, Corynebacterium glutamicum and Momordica charantia should be examined, particularly for the capability to synthesise chiral epoxides and 1, 2 -diols of industrial interest. Therefore an assay system had to be set up which allows to screen a large number of enzymes for their hydrolytic activity against a wide variety of epoxides. With this assay the characterisation the three putative epoxide hydrolases from Bacillus subtilis 168, Corynebacterium glutamicum and Momordica charantia should be done. The genes encoding for the putative epoxide hydrolases were obtained by the BASF cooperation which was the industrial partner in this project. In order to characterise the three putative epoxide hydrolases from Bacillus subtilis 168, Corynebacterium glutamicum and Momordica charantia two methods for the detection of vicinal diols were developed, both based on the oxidative cleavage of 1, 2 -diols with periodate. After the cleavage the detection of the amount of vicinal diol was done in two different ways. The products of the oxidative cleavage are aldehydes and/or ketones. Aldehydes can be detected by a colouring reaction with pararosaniline (PSS-Assay: Periodate cleavage and Schiff reagent). The 1, 2 -diols in the substrate/product combinations could be detected with a standard error of 12 % and a detection limit of < 5 µmol. The method targets the product of the enzymatic reaction rather than the substrates and thus results in a low number of false negatives. Furthermore, any epoxide which can be metabolized to a vicinal diol with at least one hydrogen substituent at the hydroxyl group can be tested. The second method is based on the detection of excessive periodate after the cleavage by 5 (6) -carboxyfluorescein. The fluorescence dye is destroyed by periodate and not destroyed by the substrate, product or other substances. Therefore the fluorescence is an indicator for the amount of vicinal diol in the test solution. A high amount of 1, 2 -diol leads to a low concentration of periodate, thus causing a high fluorescence and vice versa. The PSC-Assay was validated with 7 substrate/product combinations in the same manner as the PSS-Assay. The 1, 2 -diols in the substrate/product combinations could be detected with a standard error of 4 % and a detection limit of < 1 µmol. Although not all cosolvents can be used with the PSC-Assay and the product of the enzymatic reaction is not directly targeted, the lower detection limit, better standard error and less hands on time are big advantages of this assay. Three putative epoxide hydrolases from B. subtilis, C. glutamicum und M. charantia were investigated. In the protein sequence of the putative epoxide hydrolase from C. glutamicum two of three amino acids from the catalytic triade, as well as the proton donor are missing. This leads to the conclusion that the gene from C. glutamicum is not a common epoxide hydrolase. All proteins were successfully recombinant expressed in E. coli. The resulting protein fractions were tested for epoxide hydrolase activity towards seven epoxides by the PSS and PSC-Assay. Thereby no epoxide hydrolase activity with all tested substrates could be detected. In the second part of this work the aim was the determine the gene encoding for the hydrolase from Rhodococcus ruber DSM 44319 which is capable of hydrolyzing cis- 2, 3 -oxirane dicarboxylic acid to L(+) -tartaric acid. L(+) -tartaric acid is produced in a scale of 30000 t/a mainly in Spain, France und Italy from residues of wine production. Prices fluctuate around 5 €/kg depending on the season and the wine harvest. Therefore a production method which is independent from natural raw material is desirable. R. ruber DSM 44319 cells or cell extract hydrolyses cis- 2, 3 -oxirane dicarboxylic acid with a high stereoselectivity to L(+) -tartaric. The gene encoding for this hydrolase was not known at the beginning of this work. The enzyme catalyzing this reaction was isolated from R. ruber DSM 44319 in multistep purification with a purification factor of approximately 450. The purified protein was characterised and parts of the protein sequence were determined. With these fragments a hydrolase from R. rhodochrous LMPG- 18079 could be identified which catalyzes the same reaction. It could be shown, that both genes encoding for these hydrolases are identical. Protein <b>alignements</b> between the Hydrolase sequence of R. ruber with known epoxide hydrolases showed no similarity. However, the enzyme class of haloacid dehalogenases showed a significant similarity to the hydrolase of R. ruber. Therefore the hydrolase from R. ruber could be identified as a haloacid dehalogenase with epoxide hydrolase activity...|$|R
