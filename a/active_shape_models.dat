As a starting point, two customized <b>active</b> <b>shape</b> <b>models</b> are trained on data sets of cervical and lumbar images, respectively. Here, a methodology to include edge {{information in the}} gray-level modeling part of the <b>active</b> <b>shape</b> <b>models</b> is developed to increase the representativeness of the model and to improve the chances of finding vertebral boundaries. <b>Active</b> <b>shape</b> <b>models</b> ’ initialization shortcoming is then addressed by a customized implementation of the Generalized Hough Transform, which provides {{an estimate of the}} pose of the vertebrae within target images. <b>Active</b> <b>shape</b> <b>models</b> ’ shortcoming of lack of local deformation is addressed by a customized implementation of the technique of Deformable Models. In this implementation, an energy minimization approach is employed in which the external energy term is extracted from the training set of images and the internal energy terms control the shape of the template.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to improve the accuracy and reliability of the spinal midline reconstructions in scoliosis from back shape data. Design. An <b>active</b> <b>shape</b> <b>model</b> which covers the variety of scoliotic curves with a minimum of adjustable parameters is designed for the reconstruction of the spinal midline based on rasterstereographic back surface measurements. BACKGROUND. To reduce the number of X-rays needed for patients with a scoliosis, an automatic method was developed for the reconstruction of spinal deformities from back shape data. METHODS. 264 digital X-rays of 264 patients with scoliosis were used as a training set. By examining the statistics of the vertebral body centres a point distribution model was derived. The model is used as a basis to reconstruct the spinal midline from back <b>shape</b> data (<b>active</b> <b>shape</b> <b>model).</b> RESULTS. 478 rasterstereographs of 114 scoliotic patients have been evaluated with this new procedure and with an existing procedure. Both procedures deliver a three-dimensional curve of the spinal midline. The frontal projections of these spinal midlines are compared with the vertebral centres of the corresponding 478 X-rays. The <b>active</b> <b>shape</b> <b>model</b> improved the results as compared to the existing procedure from sigma(x) = 3. 4 mm to sigma(x) = 3. 0 mm. CONCLUSION. The use of the <b>active</b> <b>shape</b> <b>model</b> improves the overall accuracy of the spinal midline reconstructions in scoliosis from back shape data. RELEVANCE. Improvements to the accuracy and the reliability of the three-dimensional spinal reconstruction based on back shape data, can lead to an additional reduction of X-rays for patients with a scoliosis. status: publishe...|$|R
