The basketball then begins to bounce out of the bag, {{jumps out of the}} city streets and gets into a Lada taxi. After that, it continues to bounce and causes troubles in an office. Its owner struggles to chase the ball but then manages to catch it for a second. Unfortunately, the ball escapes and is run over by a truck driven by The Chemical Brothers. The basketball re-inflates after the accident, jumps into and eventually gets trapped inside an old phone booth near Baross Street, swells to an enormous size, and explodes.|$|E

It changed its name after being bought by The Mall Company and was, {{by the end of}} 2008 rebranded 'The Mall, Sutton Coldfield'. The Mall complex also includes a multi-storey car park. As a result of investment, the appearance of the {{shopping centre}} was improved in 2006 which included the installation of a glass roof above one of the walkways and the removal of a public square to form a cafe and extra retail units. There are now plans to construct a food court above Bishop's Court in the shopping centre. The shopping centre was formerly home to three bronze sculptures that depict, respectively, {{a boy and a girl}} on rollerskates, <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dog, and a boy and a girl playing leapfrog, which have been moved to Rectory Park.|$|E

Garfield later said of his childhood, [...] "I lament that I was born to poverty, and in this chaos of childhood, seventeen years passed before I caught any inspiration... a precious 17 years when <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> father and some wealth might have become fixed in manly ways." ...|$|E

Moon attended Alperton Secondary Modern School after failing his eleven plus exam, which precluded his attending a grammar school. His art teacher said in a report: [...] "Retarded artistically.

He was the son of a farmer and dry goods merchant who emigrated to the United States of America with his family in 1887.

2500|$|Little {{is known}} of Richardson's early years beyond the few things that Richardson was willing to share. Although he was not {{forthcoming}} with specific events and incidents, he did talk {{about the origins of}} his writing ability; Richardson would tell stories to his friends and spent his youth constantly writing letters. One such letter, written when Richardson was almost 11, was directed to a woman in her 50s who was in the habit of constantly criticizing others. [...] "Assuming the style and address of a person in years", Richardson cautioned her about her actions. However, his handwriting was used to determine that it was his work, and the woman complained to his mother. The result was, as he explains, that [...] "my mother chid me for the freedom taken by such <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> woman of her years" [...] but also [...] "commended my principles, though she censured the liberty taken".|$|E
2500|$|While Dillon and Miss Kitty {{clearly had}} a close {{personal}} relationship, the two never married. In a July 2, 2002, Associated Press interview with Bob Thomas, Arness explained, [...] "If they were man and wife, {{it would make a}} lot of difference. The people upstairs decided it was better to leave the show as it was, which I totally agreed with." [...] In the episode [...] "Waste", featuring Johnny Whitaker as <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> prostitute mother, her madam questions Dillon as to why the law overlooks Miss Kitty's enterprise. It appears that bordellos could exist [...] "at the law's discretion" [...] (meaning the marshal's). As an historical matter, prior to the First World War, few laws criminalized prostitution in the United States. Miss Kitty was written out in 1974. The actress sought more free time and reportedly missed her late co-star, Glenn Strange, who played her Long Branch barkeep, Sam. When Blake decided not to return for the show's 20th (and final) season, the character was said to have returned to New Orleans. She was replaced by the hoarse-voiced, matronly actress Fran Ryan (known to many as the second Doris Ziffel on CBS' Green Acres).|$|E

2500|$|In a 2014 {{review for}} Uncut, Richard Williams said {{that just as}} the Beatles' fan-club Christmas records were {{inspired}} by the Goons, Harrison's inspiration for Electronic Sound {{appears to have been}} [...] "another BBC institution of their formative years: the Radiophonic Workshop". According to Williams, the album conveys [...] "the joy of <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new toy" [...] and [...] "sounds like what you might get if you taped a contact microphone to the stomach of a digestively challenged robot". He concluded by saying that the self-deprecating sleeve note from Arthur Wax [...] "still sums it up". Scott Elingburg of PopMatters welcomed its Apple Years reissue and described the album as the artist's [...] "most 'experimental' work" [...] and, like the remastered Wonderwall Music, [...] "raw and gorgeous, alive and capable of sparking ingenuity". He said that while Harrison was [...] "no Brian Eno or Jeff Lynne" [...] in terms of synthesizer innovation, [...] "the intention behind Electronic Sound is one of exploration and discovery, an artist limbering up his musical mind to discover how far the boundaries of modern instrumentation could take him. Out of context, Electronic Sound would sound maudlin, even dull. Here, as a key step in the progression of Harrison the solo artist, it sounds audacious in its primitiveness ..." ...|$|E
2500|$|An unrepentant lifelong doodler and sketcher, Saint-Exupéry had {{for many}} years sketched little people on his napkins, tablecloths, letters to paramours and friends, lined {{notebooks}} and other scraps of paper. Early figures took on a multitude of appearances, engaged {{in a variety of}} tasks. Some appeared as doll-like figures, baby puffins, angels with wings, and even a figure similar to that in Robert Crumb's later famous Keep On Truckin' of 1968. In a 1940 letter to a friend he sketched a character with his own thinning hair, sporting a bow tie, viewed as a boyish alter-ego, and he later gave a similar doodle to Elizabeth Reynal at his New York publisher's office. Most often the diminutive figure was expressed as [...] "...a slip of <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> turned up nose, lots of hair, long baggy pants that were too short for him and with a long scarf that whipped in the wind. Usually the boy had a puzzled expression... his boy Saint-Exupéry came to think of as [...] "the little prince," [...] and he was usually found standing on top of a tiny planet. Most of the time he was alone, sometimes walking up a path. Sometimes there was a single flower on the planet." [...] His characters were frequently seen chasing butterflies; when asked why they did so, Saint-Exupéry, who thought of the figures as his alter-egos, replied that they were actually pursuing a [...] "realistic ideal". Saint-Exupéry eventually settled on the image of the young, precocious child with curly blond hair, an image which would become the subject of speculations as to its source. [...] One [...] "most striking" [...] illustration depicted the pilot-narrator asleep beside his stranded plane prior to the prince's arrival. Although images of the narrator were created for the story, none survived Saint-Exupéry's editing process.|$|E
