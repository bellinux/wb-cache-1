40|$|AbstractThe main aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} gas–oil relative permeability curves as the main flow function in different gas injection scenarios, immiscible and near miscible in case of highly fractured reservoirs. In this research, some experiments have been done on the reservoir core sample selected from sandstone formation {{in one of the}} Iranian naturally fractured oil reservoirs. The core is saturated with oil sample and CO 2 is injected into oil saturated core sample. Experiments have been performed on both of the <b>sandstone</b> and <b>artificial</b> fractured <b>sandstone,</b> represented as no fractured and highly fractured reservoirs, based on incremental pressure algorithm approaching into near miscible condition. Inverse modeling method has been used to calculate relative permeability curves. By comparing the relative permeability curves in immiscible and near-miscible conditions, the results show that in sandstone core type this change is considerable, but in highly <b>artificial</b> fractured <b>sandstone</b> with a high ratio of <b>artificial</b> fractured to <b>sandstone</b> absolute permeability (Kef /Ks) is not substantial. Moreover the results show that in the described case of artificial fractured core type so simple conventional relative permeability methods have the same results compared to a sophisticated inverse modeling method. The other main result is the lack of miscibility activation in near miscible injection through the highly fractured reservoirs leading to viscose dominant flow rather than capillary. Finally by considering this changing behavior, a better knowledge of gas front movement through highly fractured reservoirs in low IFT regions can be obtained...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFractured {{reservoirs}} form a {{large percentage}} of the world's hydrocarbon reserves. However, in spite of their wide occurrence and huge reserves, the oil recovery from most of these reservoirs is extremely low. CO 2 flooding has proven to be an efficient Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) method. This article addresses the use of MRI technique to follow the removal process of oil, water, supercritical CO 2 multiphase flow in fractured <b>artificial</b> consolidated <b>sandstone</b> core with permeability heterogeneity at a typical reservoir temperature and pressure condition. Fluid saturation development was monitored both in the matrix and in the fractures. 2 D images at various times and quantitative saturation curves were obtained during all stages of the flooding process. The fronts and interfaces between displaced and displacing fluids were also dynamics monitored in situ during water and subsequent supercritical CO 2 flooding process. The results showed that the oil recovery rate can be determined by porosity, permeability and structure of the core, supercritical CO 2 flooding can enhance oil recovery evidently after the water flooding...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMicrobubble CO 2 can be {{generated}} by injecting CO 2 through special porous filters attached to borehole casing or gas tubing. When injecting microbubble CO 2 into saline aquifers, dissolution of injected CO 2 into formation water can be accelerated up more than 20 %, compared to conventional CO 2 injection. As a result, microbubble CO 2 injection will minimize the free CO 2 fraction in the subsurface and consequently contribute to the long term safety of large-scale CO 2 storage. Microbubble CO 2 injection will also lead to effective use of pore space within the reservoirs. P-wave velocity and resistivity changes obtained when injecting CO 2 in microbubble and normal bubble sizes into <b>artificial</b> brine-saturated porous <b>sandstones</b> indicate more pore water displaced by the injected microbubble CO 2 in terms of sweep efficiency. Combined effects of enhanced dissolution and sweep efficiency in microbubble CO 2 injection can reduce the potential risk of CO 2 leakage from the subsurface and enable us to store more CO 2 in same reservoirs compared to normal CO 2 injection {{as well as economic}} benefit of achieving higher oil recovery...|$|R

40|$|In {{petroleum}} engineering, {{to investigate}} {{the effect of a}} certain factors on rock permeability, it is more convenient to use homogenous rock samples with nearly constant initial permeability. Obtaining as sandstone rock samples with a constant initial permeability is very difficult. Also the difficulties in getting (or lack) the natural field cores let many researchers to look for a permanent source of rock samples. Adding to these circumstances, the permanent need for continuous supply of rock cores for teaching purposes encourages to look for an alternative source of rock samples. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to simulate natural sandstone rock and come-up with a homogeneous compacted rock with known properties. Many scholars investigated the effect of some sedimentation and compaction factors on rock properties, but few attempts to manufacture an <b>artificial</b> <b>sandstone</b> matrix with wide ranges of rock properties were made. In this study the main rock lithification factors were defined and their effect on rock properties were evaluated. These factors are grain size, cementing material concentration, compaction (confining) pressure, and dehydration temperature. Five groups of a grain size ranged between 45 and 300 micron were used. The cementing material was added 4 to 8 % by weight of sand grains, and a 11350 to 23500 psi compaction pressure was applied to shape the sandstone cores. By varying these factors, a wide range of rock samples with different properties were produced. The stability of these samples and their properties were evaluated. A homogeneous <b>artificial</b> <b>sandstone</b> cores samples with a permeability of 15 to 5000 md and a porosity of 20 to 33 % were obtained. The mean pore size of these core samples was between 1 micron and. 50 micron. The results of this study were presented as graphs of simulated lithification factors versus rock properties. With the help of these graphs, a sandstone core with a certain initial permeability and mean pore size can be produced...|$|E
30|$|A {{modified}} {{model of}} porosity variation under vibration is developed in this paper, {{based on the}} function mechanisms in low-frequency vibration production technology and factors impacting the porosity variation in seepage media. The factors include the amount of mobile pores, actual percolating space per pore/throats, {{as well as the}} additional change in pore volume by packing mode and fracture distribution. In contrast to the experimental data in <b>artificial</b> <b>sandstone</b> cores, the modified model of porosity variation reduces the error from that between the experiment data and the formula of Biot’s model, which considers only the compaction of matrix and fluid. It is useful to illustrate the concrete change in the seepage under vibration, as a foundation of wave propagation in seepage media. Certainly, there is a necessity to further improve the model because of the error, which is mainly caused by the serious heterogeneity in natural rock and the double-sided roles, promoting and inhibiting, on the staggered solid–fluid motion.|$|E
30|$|As an {{unconventional}} method, low-frequency vibration production technology is applied for oil recovery enhancement in amounts of oil fields. Petro-physic properties in seepage fluid-saturated porous media with are {{revealed to be}} influenced seriously by elastic wave in substantial researches. With an assumption of static fluid-saturated, porosity variation equation in Biot’s model is not appropriate to interpret the percolating in low-frequency vibration production technology, there exists an obvious error from the actual experimental data. Based on the function mechanisms and factors controlling the porosity in seepage fluid-saturated porous media, a modified model of porosity variation under vibration is developed to improve the accuracy. Different coefficients for porosity increase are derived. The factors include the compaction of matrix and fluid, proportion of seepage interconnected pores, change of adhesive layer in capillary tube as well as transport of particle under vibration. Furthermore, a comparison with experimental result in <b>artificial</b> <b>sandstone</b> cores is carried out to verify the validity. An error of about 4 – 21  % is reduced by the modified porosity variation compared with that in Biot’s model. As a critical basis of wave equation, the modified porosity is helpful to illustrate the concrete change of percolation in low-frequency vibration production technology.|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the mechanism(s) of water flood with horizontal injection wells. The experiment was performed using a three-dimensional (3 D) physical model made by <b>artificial</b> <b>sandstone</b> of the dimension of 60 [*]cm × 30 [*]cm × 5 [*]cm. The saturation profile of oil and water phases was monitored by measuring the electrical resistivity using microelectrodes. It is difficult to model a field-scale gravity-assisted water flood process in the laboratory as the gravity force is very small in the physical model. In this paper, similarity criteria, dimensional analysis, and π principle were used to design the model parameters. We found that the ratios of gravity force to production pressure differential, capillary force, and viscous force are {{the three most important}} similarity criteria. Based on dimensional analysis, both capillary and viscous forces were designed in the physical model to represent the capillary and bond number in the reservoir conditions. Hence, in physical model, rock permeability of 6 darcies was selected to reduce the capillary force and the fluid viscosity of 583 [*]cp was selected to reduce the viscous force based on calculation. The use of horizontal injection well can improve the sweep efficiency by 17. 2 %, compared with the case of vertical injection well. To determine the optimal driving force, the ratio of gravity force and production pressure differential was varied from 1 [*]:[*] 1 to 1 [*]:[*] 16. The experiment has shown that the ratio of 1 [*]:[*] 8 yields the highest heavy oil recovery (44. 04 %) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the PhD research on electrokinetics in porous media. Electrokinetic phenomena are {{induced by the}} relative motion between a fluid and a solid surface and {{are directly related to}} the existence of an electric double layer between the fluid and the solid grain surface. Electrokinetic phenomena consist of several different effects such as streaming potential, electroosmosis, electrophoresis. The thesis only focuses on streaming potential and electroosmosis effects in porous media. Below is the abstract of the research. Chapter 1 introduces the applications of electrokinetic phenomena in geophysical applications and environmental applications, physical chemistry of the interface between solid grains and fluids, and the theoretical backgrounds of streaming potential and electroosmosis effects happening in porous media. Chapter 2 presents an approach to characterize porous media using dc measurements of streaming potential and electroosmosis effects. In chapter 3, we study permeability dependence of streaming potential including the effects of the variation of the zeta potential and surface conductance due to the difference in mineral compositions between samples. In chapter 4 we have carried out streaming potential measurement as a function of electrolyte concentration and temperature for a set of well-defined consolidated samples. in chapter 5 we study the dependence of the zeta potential on types of electrolytes systematically using streaming potential measurements. In chapter 6, we carry out the streaming potential measurements for an <b>artificial</b> <b>sandstone</b> sample saturated with a binary mixture of triethylamine-water with three different mass fractions. In Appendix A, we present the approaches and setups to determine parameters of porous media. In Appendix B, we derive an expression to calculate the zeta potential for divalent electrolytes that is applied in chapter 5 to explain the experimental data...|$|E
40|$|Since ripper tynes were {{attached}} to bulldozers, over thirty years ago, there have been problems determining whether the rock on a particular excavation site could be ripped or would require blasting. Several methods {{have been developed for}} determining the rippability of rock but, in general, they have been based on very limited data and experience has shown them to be inaccurate. An extensive database of ripping and geological data has been obtained from observing excavation of 19 rock types on 15 sites by a range of bulldozers. This database has been statistically analysed to determine which factors have the greatest influence on the rippability of an area. Analysis has produced a new method for estimating the likely productivity of a site when certain geological parameters are known. Detailed seismic refraction arrays were performed on excavation sites in an attempt to determine whether seismic investigation techniques could be improved. Numerical modelling of the ripping process was attempted but had limited success although it was useful in assessing the influence of different defect orientations and boot angles on the ripping. Laboratory scale modelling of a ripper tyne penetrating and ripping <b>artificial</b> <b>sandstone</b> was performed. The results were compared to full scale bulldozer trials where the ripping forces were monitored by strain gauges attached to the tyne. The laboratory modelling showed that there was a parabolic relationship between ripping force and depth, and also between ripping force and unconfined compressive strength. The relationship between force and depth was confirmed by the bulldozer trials. It is shown that existing methods of prediction are inaccurate and that the new method is superior, but that there are still uncertainties possibly due to local variability of geological conditions and the influence of the operator...|$|E
