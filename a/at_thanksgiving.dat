500|$|Despite the {{differences}} between the two men, Roosevelt in November 1903 asked Hanna to run his re-election campaign.

Morgan, who disliked Roosevelt's policies, offered to finance the Hanna presidential campaign when he hosted the Hannas <b>at</b> <b>Thanksgiving,</b> though the senator remained silent at the offer. [...] In December, Hanna and Roosevelt had a lengthy meeting and resolved many of their differences.

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of September 23, 1957, the nine Black high school {{students}} faced an angry mob of over 1,000 Whites in front of Central High School who were protesting the integration project.
