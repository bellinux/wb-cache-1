5|$|Juha Vainio became {{interested}} in music and started socializing with musicians in the mid-1950s. The centre of jazz music in Kotka was the restaurant Fennia where performers including Keijo Laitinen and the cousin of Vainio's mother, Olli Miettinen played. Although Vainio was under-21 and classed as a minor, he managed to slip into the restaurant where he presented his lyrics to the musicians and was occasionally allowed to play the piano. Vainio recalled that his friends remembered him as being always penniless. He started drinking more <b>and</b> <b>more,</b> <b>often</b> asking his friends for a drink.|$|E
5|$|Ti Noel, an {{illiterate}} slave, is a {{protagonist of}} African origin. He {{begins as a}} young slave who, during the unravelling of the novel, travels to Cuba before returning to Haiti. He is twice branded as a slave but now is a free man. Although he grows old, he remains a witness rather than actor <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> reacts to, as opposed to causes, events throughout the novel. He is in admiration of Macandal's qualities prior {{to the loss of}} Macandal's arm; he accompanies Macandal into the mountains and is saddened by his departure.|$|E

5|$|Women who {{identify}} as lesbian report feeling significantly different and isolated during adolescence. These emotions {{have been cited}} as appearing on average at 15 years old in lesbians and 18 years old in women {{who identify}} as bisexual. On the whole, women tend to work through developing a self-concept internally, or with other women with whom they are intimate. Women also limit who they divulge their sexual identities to, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> see being lesbian as a choice, as opposed to gay men, who work more externally and see being gay as outside their control.|$|E
5|$|Birds forage singly or {{in pairs}} in summer, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> in larger flocks in autumn and winter, {{during which time}} {{they are more likely}} to loiter around people and urban areas. They {{occasionally}} associate with Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen) or common starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) when foraging. Birds have also been encountered with grey currawongs (S.versicolor) and satin bowerbirds (Ptilinorhynchus violaceus). The species has been reported stealing food from other birds such as the Australian hobby (Falco longipennis), collared sparrowhawk (Accipiter cirrocephalus), and sulphur-crested cockatoo (Cacatua galerita). Pied currawongs will also harass each other. A 2007 study conducted by researchers from the Australian National University showed that white-browed scrubwren (Sericornis frontalis) nestlings became silent when they heard the recorded sound of a pied currawong walking through leaf litter.|$|E
5|$|By the 14th century, castles were {{combining}} defences with luxurious, sophisticated {{living arrangements}} and landscaped gardens and parks. Early gunpowder weapons {{were used to}} defend castles {{by the end of}} the 14th century and gunports became an essential feature for a fashionable castle. The economics of maintaining castles meant that many were left to decline or abandoned; in contrast, a small number of castles were developed by the very wealthy into palaces that hosted lavish feasts and celebrations amid elaborate architecture. Smaller defensible structures called tower houses emerged in the north of England to protect against the Scottish threat. By the late medieval period, town walls were increasingly less military in character <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> expressions of civic pride or part of urban governance: many grand gatehouses were built in the 14th and 15th centuries for these purposes.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{evidence}} of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are social behaviors that are inherited and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage {{in some form of}} social interaction before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed {{over a period of time}} using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.|$|E
5|$|Natives of {{the region}} {{encountered}} foreigners at several times and places during the 18thand 19thcenturies. European and American vessels explored the coastal area around {{the mouth of the}} river in the late 18thcentury, trading with local natives. The contact would prove devastating to the Indian tribes; a large portion of their population was wiped out by a smallpox epidemic. Canadian explorer Alexander Mackenzie crossed what is now interior British Columbia in 1793. From 1805 to 1807, the Lewis and Clark Expedition entered the Oregon Country along the Clearwater and Snake rivers, and encountered numerous small settlements of natives. Their records recount tales of hospitable traders who were not above stealing small items from the visitors. They also noted brass teakettles, a British musket, and other artifacts that had been obtained in trade with coastal tribes. From the earliest contact with westerners, the natives of the mid- and lower Columbia were not tribal, but instead congregated in social units no larger than a village, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> at a family level; these units would shift with the season as people moved about, following the salmon catch up and down the river's tributaries.|$|E

25|$|Novelty Race – In these races, {{one of the}} presenters took to racing a car in a {{head-to-head}} {{race against}} an unusual opponent. Such races were arranged mainly to demonstrate the various strengths <b>and,</b> <b>more</b> <b>often,</b> weaknesses of cars, with opponents ranging from a marathon runner, to a pigeon and the postal service.|$|E
25|$|Shipboard {{discipline}} aboard merchant {{and naval}} vessels was notoriously harsh, <b>and,</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> than not, violent. Pirates, having suffered under these measures, used {{a more democratic}} process when determining how aberrant sailors would be punished, and there were fewer transgressions that were considered punishable. These punishments were still often violent, which was the norm in the early 18th century.|$|E
25|$|By the 1970s, {{feminine}} traces in some {{versions of}} the name <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> in the epithets led to various theories. Among them, that Nefertiti was masquerading as Smenkhkare before changing her name again to Neferneferuaten. When considered with various stela depicting Akhenaten with another king in familiar, if not intimate poses, the theory that Akhenaten and Smenkhkare were homosexual arose.|$|E

25|$|According to the 1990 U.S. Census 168,659 of {{the total}} 202,658 {{documented}} Nicaraguans in the U.S. were born in Nicaragua. In 1992 approximately 10–12% of the Nicaraguan population had emigrated. These emigrants tended to be disproportionately of working age, better educated, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> white-collar workers than nonmigrants. In addition, emigrants {{were more likely to}} come from larger premigration households and higher income households.|$|E

25|$|High densities {{mean that}} birds are {{close contact with}} {{neighbouring}} breeders. Common murres perform appeasement displays more often at high densities <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> than razorbills. Allopreening is common both between mates and between neighbours. Allopreening helps to reduce parasites, and it may also have important social functions. Frequency of allopreening a neighbour correlates well with current breeding success. Allopreening may function as a stress-reducer; ledges {{with low levels of}} allopreening show increased levels of fighting and reduced breeding success.|$|E
25|$|Mullally {{was a poor}} batsman, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> {{than not}} {{occupied}} the No. 11 position in the England batting line-up. However, he struck an aggressive 16 off 15 balls, including 3 cross-batted fours off Glenn McGrath, to help England to a 12-run win against Australia at Melbourne in 1998/99. His highest Test score of 24 against Pakistan featured several airborne boundaries off Wasim Akram. Allegedly the then England coach David Lloyd had offered Mullally 30 pints of Guinness to score 30 in that match.|$|E

Missions were consent-based, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> than not observers were unarmed—such was the case with UNTSO in the Middle East and UNCIP in India and Pakistan. Others were armed—such as UNEF-I, established during the Suez Crisis. They were largely successful in this role.|$|E
