5|$|Faced {{with the}} {{prospect}} of a takeover by the pro-communists, UMNO changed their minds <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>merger.</b> On 27 May, Malaya's Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, mooted the idea of a Federation of Malaysia, comprising existing Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Brunei and the British Borneo territories of North Borneo and Sarawak. The UMNO leaders believed that the additional Malay population in the Borneo territories would offset Singapore's Chinese population. The British government, for its part, believed that the merger would prevent Singapore from becoming a haven for communism.|$|E

The AMWU lost this challenge and, as a result, was unable to access its funds. Despite the efforts of its National Organiser, Manny Shinwell, the AMWU was wound up in early 1927.|$|E

The takeover was a friendly one, and Melbourne had approached Tetley <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>merger.</b> The brewery and its 245 tied houses were acquired for £3.5 million. Production of Melbourne beer immediately ceased, although Tetley Mild was brewed at the Melbourne brewery until 1962.

500|$|During this period, some Straits Chinese {{began taking}} {{interest}} in local politics, especially in Penang, {{where there was}} an active Chinese secessionist movement. Identifying more with the British than the Malays, they were especially angered by references to them as pendatang asing (foreigners). Avoiding both UMNO and the MCA, they believed that while UMNO and Malay extremists were intent on extending Malay privileges and restricting Chinese rights, the MCA was too [...] "selfish", {{and could not be}} relied on. Uncomfortable <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>merger</b> of the Straits Settlements with Malaya, they did not feel a sense of belonging in a [...] "Malaya for the Malays" [...] where they were not considered bumiputra ("sons of the soil"). One Straits Chinese leader indignantly declared, [...] "I can claim to be more anak Pulau Pinang [...] than 99 per cent of the Malays living here today." [...] With the government's stout rejection of secession, the movement eventually petered out.|$|E

500|$|What {{followed}} {{was a period}} of uncertainty regarding exactly who would and would not {{be a part of the}} merged team. Leopard Trek had 27 riders under contract for 2012 and Team RadioShack had 13 [...] UCI rules impose a hard limit of 30 riders on top-level teams, meaning at least ten riders with valid contracts would be released from them. Leopard Trek riders were not told <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>merger</b> ahead of time and were unsure of their status at a time when riders everywhere looked to conclusively determine their places of employment for the upcoming season. The situation was further complicated by two rider transfers made in August, when Ben Hermans and Grégory Rast signed with Leopard Trek away from Team RadioShack, meaning they had effectively re-joined the team they had only just left. The new team also signed four riders who had not been a member of either side in 2011. This resulted in 12 riders departing for other teams, with 13 incoming from Team RadioShack's 2011 formation (that number including Hermans and Rast) and 12 riders being retained from Leopard Trek's 2011 formation. The fused team announced its new name as RadioShack-Nissan-Trek, though UCI rules limit registry to two title sponsors, meaning their name in the official UCI record is RadioShack-Nissan.|$|E
2500|$|The Rainbow chapter at Southwestern University {{initially}} expressed optimism <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>merger</b> with Delta Tau Delta.

Rainbows at the University of Texas contacted their Southwestern fraters and suggested both houses surrender their charters and defect to Phi Delta Theta, which had indicated it would be receptive to absorbing the displaced Rainbow members. In doing so, the Southwestern chapter became a new chapter of Phi Delta Theta, while the members of the Texas chapter were simply initiated into the existing Phi Delta Theta chapter on that campus.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{shareholders}} {{expressed concerns}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>merger,</b> notably Square's original founder and largest shareholder Miyamoto, who would find himself holding a significantly smaller {{percentage of the}} combined companies. Other criticism came from Takashi Oya of Deutsche Securities who expressed doubts {{about the benefits of}} such a merger: [...] "Enix outsources game development and has few in-house creators, while Square does everything by itself. The combination of the two provides no negative factors but would bring {{little in the way of}} operational synergies." [...] Miyamoto's concerns were eventually resolved by altering the exchange ratio of the merger so that each Square share would be exchanged for 0.85 Enix shares rather than 0.81 shares, and the merger was greenlit. The merger was set for April 1, 2003, on which date the newly merged entity Square Enix came into being. At the time of the merger, 80% of Square Enix staff were made up of former Square employees. As part of the merger, former Square president Yoichi Wada was appointed president of the new corporation, while former Enix president Keiji Honda became its vice president. The founder of Enix and the largest shareholder of the newly combined corporation, Yasuhiro Fukushima, was made its honorary chairman.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{their successes}} in {{governing}} Singapore, the PAP leaders believed that Singapore's future lay with Malaya due to strong {{ties between the}} two nations. It was thought that the merger would benefit the economy by creating a common market which will support new industries, thus solving the ongoing unemployment woes in Singapore. However, a sizable pro-communist wing of the PAP were strongly opposed to the merger, fearing a loss of influence. This is because the ruling party of Malaya, United Malays National Organisation, was staunchly anti-communist and would support the non-communist faction of PAP against them. UMNO, who were initially skeptical of the [...] idea of a merger as they distrust the PAP government and were concerned that the large Chinese population in Singapore would alter the racial balance on which their political power base depended, changed their minds <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>merger</b> after being afraid of being taken over by pro-communists.
