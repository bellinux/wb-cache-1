25|$|An <b>adiabatic</b> <b>process</b> is {{one where}} there is no heat {{transfer}} between the fluid and the surroundings: the system is insulated against heat transfer.

25|$|Sir Isaac Newton {{computed}} {{the speed}} of sound in air as , which is too low by about 15%,. Newton's analysis was good save for neglecting the (then unknown) effect of rapidly-fluctuating temperature in a sound wave (in modern terms, sound wave compression and expansion of air is an <b>adiabatic</b> <b>process,</b> not an isothermal process). This error was later rectified by Laplace.|$|E
25|$|Polytropic - This model {{takes into}} account both a rise in {{temperature}} in the gas {{as well as some}} loss of energy (heat) to the compressor's components. This assumes that heat may enter or leave the system, and that input shaft work can appear as both increased pressure (usually useful work) and increased temperature above adiabatic (usually losses due to cycle efficiency). Compression efficiency is then the ratio of temperature rise at theoretical 100 percent (adiabatic) vs. actual (polytropic). Polytropic compression will use a value of n between 0 (a constant-pressure process) and infinity (a constant volume process). For the typical case where an effort is made to cool the gas compressed by an approximately <b>adiabatic</b> <b>process,</b> the value of n will be between 1 and k.|$|E

25|$|The solidus {{temperatures}} of most rocks (the temperatures below {{which they are}} completely solid) increase with increasing pressure {{in the absence of}} water. Peridotite at depth in the Earth's mantle may be hotter than its solidus temperature at some shallower level. If such rock rises during the convection of solid mantle, it will cool slightly as it expands in an <b>adiabatic</b> <b>process,</b> but the cooling is only about 0.3°C per kilometer. Experimental studies of appropriate peridotite samples document that the solidus temperatures increase by 3°C to 4°C per kilometer. If the rock rises far enough, it will begin to melt. Melt droplets can coalesce into larger volumes and be intruded upwards. This process of melting from the upward movement of solid mantle is critical {{in the evolution of the}} Earth.|$|E
25|$|Malaita's {{climate is}} {{extremely}} wet. It {{is located in}} the Intertropical Convergence Zone ("Doldrums"), with its fickle weather patterns. The sun is at zenith over Malaita, and thus the effect is most pronounced, in November and February. Trade winds come during the southern hemisphere's winter, and from about April to August they blow from the southeast fairly steadily. During the summer, fringes of monsoon blow over the island. Because of the surrounding sea, air temperatures are fairly consistent, with a difference between daily highs and lows averaging to 13.6°F However, across the year, the difference is much less; the mean daily temperature in the warmest month is only 3.4°F warmer than that of the coolest. Rainfall is heavy and there is constant high humidity. The most common daily pattern follows an <b>adiabatic</b> <b>process,</b> with a calm, clear morning, followed by a breeze blowing in from higher pressures over the sea, culminating in a cloudy and drizzly afternoon. At night, the weather pattern reverses, and drizzle and heavy dew dissipate the cloud cover for the morning. Tropical cyclones are the only violent weather, but they can be destructive.|$|E

40|$|<b>Adiabatic</b> <b>processes</b> {{in quantum}} {{mechanics}} are very useful {{to prepare and}} manipulate quantum states but have the drawback of requiring long operation times. Hence {{there is a long}} time for the system to interact with its environment which can lead to a loss of coherence of the final state. This decoherence is problematic for implementing future quantum technologies which require the state 2 ̆ 7 s quantum mechanical features. “Shortcuts to Adiabaticity"(STA) provides a toolbox of methods to improve on <b>adiabatic</b> <b>processes.</b> Using these methods one can derive alternative processes which work for much shorter times with perfect fidelity. Since <b>adiabatic</b> <b>processes</b> are ubiquitous in atomic, molecular and optical physics, there is a broad scope of application for STA. In this thesis, STA (especially those using Lewis-Riesenfeld invariants) are applied to a variety of quantum systems for the purpose of quantum state transfer. In particular I show that STA control schemes in two- and three-level systems can be optimised to be more stable against unwanted uncontrollable transitions than adiabatic methods with the same operation time. I also show that STA methods can be applied in a triple well ring system with complex tunnelling, in optical lattices for the purposes of generating a higher orbital state of neutral atoms and in Penning traps to quickly compress or expand the trapped ion wavefunction. Finally I also investigate the effect of classical Poisson white noise on <b>adiabatic</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Because of the {{intrinsic}} robustness, adiabatic evolutions find {{a broad range}} of applications in quantum state engineering, quantum computing, and quantum simulation. According to the original form of the quantum adiabatic theorem, for a <b>process</b> to remain <b>adiabatic,</b> its rate of change at all times must be much smaller than the energy gap of the Hamiltonian. On the other hand, in order to avoid perturbations from the environment high rates of change are desirable. This tension imposes severe limitations on the practical use of adiabatic methods. Current approaches to obtain adiabatic evolution within system coherence times are shortcuts to adiabaticity by using intricate schemes of additional counterdiabatic driving fields which however can be exceedingly challenging to implement experimentally. Here, we investigate the roles of energy gaps in quantum <b>adiabatic</b> <b>processes</b> by using a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond. We demonstrate experimentally that energy gaps may vanish while maintaining adiabatic evolution, a result that challenges traditional views. This shows that dynamic phases are more fundamental than energy gaps in quantum adiabatic evolution, the key insight that allows us to overcome the limits on evolution times imposed by the traditional form of the adiabatic theorem and to achieve, within experimental uncertainties, unit fidelity quantum <b>adiabatic</b> <b>processes</b> in finite time. The results provide a deeper understanding on quantum <b>adiabatic</b> <b>processes,</b> as well as promising strategies and directions in the control of quantum systems...|$|R
