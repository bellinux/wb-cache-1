5|$|Tyler {{cuts from}} Charlotte's buttocks, frying {{a strip of}} her flesh on <b>a</b> <b>stove.</b> Squires tells of how he began an affair with Monica, Tyler's wife and mother of his twin children, {{destroying}} Tyler's career. Tyler hands Squires the flesh, and he eats, fearing Charlotte will die. Tyler reveals how he hates cryptic crosswords, and how his son entered the Cambridge Crossword Competition, attempting to beat his mother's new husband: Squires. Squires realises that Charlotte is Tyler's daughter. Charlotte and Tyler sought revenge on Squires, but Tyler changed plans so Squires would include clues in the crossword. However, Simon's autopsy—Tyler explains—revealed that Simon and Charlotte were actually Squires's children, meaning Monica and Squires's relationship began earlier than he previously thought. Charlotte is past saving, and Tyler places a bullet on Squires's desk, quoting Chekhov's gun. Squires confirms that his middle name is Hector as he weeps over Charlotte, and Tyler circles something on the crossword. Charlotte is dead, and Squires loads the gun, placing it in his mouth. Blood splatters over the crossword and a second nina: RIP NHS.|$|E

25|$|Cookware and {{bakeware}} are {{types of}} food preparation containers, {{commonly found in}} a kitchen. Cookware comprises cooking vessels, such as saucepans and frying pans, intended for use on <b>a</b> <b>stove</b> or range cooktop. Bakeware comprises cooking vessels intended for use inside an oven. Some utensils are considered both cookware and bakeware.|$|E
5000|$|Similarly, gairaigo, {{while making}} Japanese easier to learn for foreign {{students}} in some cases, {{can also cause}} problems due to independent semantic progression. For example, English [...] "stove", from which sutōbu (...) is derived, has multiple meanings. Americans often use the word to mean a cooking appliance, and are thus surprised when Japanese take it to mean a space heater (such as <b>a</b> wood-burning <b>stove).</b> The Japanese term for <b>a</b> cooking <b>stove</b> is another gairaigo term, renji (...) , from the English [...] "range"; <b>a</b> gas <b>stove</b> is <b>a</b> gasurenji (...)

25|$|When coal, oil, natural gas, wood, or {{any other}} fuel is combusted in <b>a</b> <b>stove,</b> oven, fireplace, hot water boiler, or {{industrial}} furnace, the hot combustion product gases that are formed are called flue gases. Those gases are generally exhausted to the ambient outside air through chimneys or industrial flue gas stacks (sometimes referred to as smokestacks).|$|E

Carter is affectionately known locally as 'The Histon Giant'.|$|E
25|$|Enclosing a fire also {{prevents}} {{air from}} being sucked {{from the room}} into the chimney. This can represent a significant loss of heat as an open fireplace can pull away many cubic metres of heated air per hour. Efficiency is generally regarded as the maximum heat output of <b>a</b> <b>stove</b> or fire, and is usually referred to by manufacturers as the difference between heat to the room and heat lost up the chimney.|$|E

The hexamine stove is designed to fold into a compact size for storage.|$|R
25|$|Until 1950 {{the line}} was a freight-only service. The first {{passenger}} service launched in 1950 and connected Esquel with Buenos Aires (arriving at Constitución station), changing trains at Jacobacci. Passengers would occupy loose wooden benches around <b>a</b> <b>stove</b> {{which could be used}} for light cooking and above all to prepare mate and keep warm. The bends of the line in the Andean foothills and the slow speed of the network allowed passengers to walk alongside the train on certain sections along the 14-hour journey.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} of 1954-55, Caresse's son Billy Peabody {{was in charge of}} the Paris office for American Overseas Airlines.

50|$|<b>A</b> {{portable}} <b>stove</b> is <b>a</b> cooking <b>stove</b> {{specially designed}} to be portable and lightweight, used in camping, picnicking, backpacking, or other use in remote locations where an easily transportable means of cooking or heating is needed.

25|$|In its {{earliest}} attestation, cooking {{was done by}} roasting meat and tubers in an open fire. Pottery and other cooking vessels may be placed directly on an open fire, but setting the vessel on a support, {{as simple as a}} base of three stones, resulted in <b>a</b> <b>stove.</b> The three-stone stove is still widely used around the world. In some areas it developed into a U-shaped dried mud or brick enclosure with the opening in the front for fuel and air, sometimes with a second smaller hole at the rear.|$|E
25|$|In warm climates where air {{conditioning}} is used, any household device that gives off heat {{will result in}} a larger load on the cooling system. Items such as <b>a</b> <b>stove,</b> dish washer, clothes dryer, hot water and incandescent lighting all add heat to the home. Low power or insulated versions of these devices give off less heat for the {{air conditioning}} to remove. The air conditioning system can also improve in efficiency by using a heat sink that is cooler than the standard air heat exchanger such as geothermal or water.|$|E
25|$|Samuel Walker McCall {{was born}} in East Providence Township, Pennsylvania on February 28, 1851, to Henry and Mary Ann (Elliott) McCall, the sixth of eleven children.

McCall's father speculated in real estate and owned <b>a</b> <b>stove</b> factory, which was closed by financial reverses of the Panic of 1857. His education began at the Mount Carroll Seminary (now Shimer College) in Mount Carroll from 1864 to 1866, when that school closed to male students.|$|E
