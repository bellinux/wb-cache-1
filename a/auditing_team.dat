40|$|Some audit {{researchers}} {{suggest that}} {{high levels of}} <b>audit</b> <b>team</b> structure may encumber communication within <b>audit</b> <b>teams</b> by impeding information-gathering activities. Others suggest that structure benefits communication by coordinating controlling information flows. This study evaluated these arguments by examining {{the relationship between the}} structure of <b>audit</b> <b>teams</b> and selected communication variables (information overload, boundary spanning, satisfaction with supervision, and accuracy of information). Questionnaire data were gathered from auditors from local and national public accounting firms with 49 auditors responding processed. Only accuracy of information have significant relationship with organization struc¬ture and the others only have negative relationship. The implication is that the level of structure adopted by teams has both posi¬tive and negative effects on communica¬tion, with structured teams providing greater control over information overload but impairing satisfaction with supervision and the accuracy of information. This research support Rudolph and Walker (1998) research that find the negative rela¬tionship of <b>audit</b> <b>team</b> structure variable and communication within <b>audit</b> <b>team</b> variables (informa¬tion overload, boundary spanning, satisfaction with supervision, and accuracy of information) although the results are not all significant like their research...|$|R

Authors: Petter Johansson and David Rubin Supervisor: Andreas Jansson Course: Dissertation Accounting, 4 FE 03 E, 30 ECTS, Spring 2011. Key Words: <b>Audit</b> <b>team,</b> Efficiency, Team Work Background and problem: Theory and {{literature}} {{in the field of}} audit teams’ efficiency are limited. The theory and literature that existed was not conducted in Swedish context. It was identified that no one had examined the factors that influence the efficiency of the Swedish <b>audit</b> <b>team's.</b> Efficiency affects how resource-and cost-effective an auditing firm can be while the audit is performed with quality and therefore it is of interest to be examined. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to explore and explain what may affect Swedish audit teams’ efficiency during the work process Method: The thesis has been based on existing theory and literature to explain what affects audit teams’ effectiveness. The study was quantitative and the sample consisted of 15 unique audit teams*.   Results and conclusions: The survey indicated that autocratic leadership and judgment intervention affects the efficiency of audit teams’. The empirical results indicated that these two factors had a positive significant relationship to the <b>audit</b> <b>team's</b> effectiveness. Proposals for future research: Future research could conduct a qualitative study in which <b>audit</b> <b>teams</b> are followed during {{a longer period of time}} with a purpose to identify the underlying factors that may explain the effectiveness of an <b>audit</b> <b>team.</b> Future research may also conduct studies that compare different CPA firms to be able to capture the cultural and organizational differences between them...|$|R

5000|$|Changes and {{regulatory}} policies became {{the order of}} the day for the government following the oil spill. Transforming the way government performed its regulatory measures were address. One of the main changes that occurred was the enhanced precision by which the governing and the oil industries handle the environmental requirements for incidents such as this oil spill. The government changed their regulations and demanded Risk Management and an Emergency Plan to be put in place. Every oil institution must execute “oil Pollution Risk Assessment”. [...] This law demanded an inclusive policy manual on the avoidance of oil pollution accident. The “Emergency plan” had to take effect during an oil spill and must have the official endorsement of the environmental bureau (Greenpeace). In order to drive home the seriousness of the situation the Government established a task force (in addition to Greenpeace) to regulate and enforce the plans that were laid out by the environmental bureau. This was done in the form of an <b>auditing</b> <b>team.</b> This team must be independent and not be affiliated with any of the immediate parties (government or oil company). Oil industries were given strict guidelines to observe these regulations, by creating higher standards within their institution. This was a very challenging experience for the oil companies, who had suffered enormous financial loss during this period. Complying with the regulation was a must, but the effect it had on the oil companies was tremendous.|$|E
40|$|To {{conduct an}} {{effective}} and efficient audit, auditors rely on their professional judgement to recognise and respond to each client’s unique risks. Knowledge is a key factor behind good judgements. It is acquired through experience and directly impacts performance. Due {{to the difficulty of}} measuring knowledge, experience is used as its proxy. Auditors gain experience on-the-job, working in a series of hierarchical structured <b>teams.</b> <b>Audit</b> judgements are based on the information gathered, evaluated, documented and reviewed by <b>audit</b> <b>team</b> members, making <b>audit</b> <b>team</b> experience relevant to audit outcomes. This thesis investigates the association between <b>audit</b> <b>team</b> industry experience and client-specific experience on production effort, audit fees and audit quality. Auditors gain Industry experience working on different clients within an industry sector; client-specific experience from repeat audits on a client. Prior research has investigated how firm-level and individual-level experience (generally absent versus present within the Big 4) impacts audit outcomes. The thesis extends the literature. First, it constructs a direct measure of team-level experience available on each audit engagement. Second, the thesis investigates experience along a continuum from novice to expert. Third, it compares and contrasts industry and client-specific experience on three inter-related outcomes of the audit: production effort, audit fees and audit quality. Data were collected from two internationally networked non-Big 4 Australian firms. Audits conducted by non-Big 4 firms were selected, as auditors in these firms work on a diverse range of clients and industry sectors, allowing for a more nuanced level of analysis. Consistent with learning curve theory and assumptions in the literature, <b>audit</b> <b>team</b> industry experience results in a more efficient, although a marginally lower quality, audit. Audit fees are also lower but the realisation rate on individual engagements is unchanged. In contrast, <b>audit</b> <b>team</b> client-specific experience is associated with higher levels of production effort, higher audit fees and a higher realisation rate. <b>Audit</b> <b>team</b> client-specific experience is not associated with audit quality. Sensitivity analysis reveals that partner client-specific experience is the key driver of the <b>audit</b> <b>team</b> client-specific experience results. The thesis provides evidence that auditors benefit from their cumulative experience prior to obtaining expertise, and that <b>audit</b> <b>team</b> industry experience and client-specific experience do not substitute or complement each other; each has an independent impact on <b>audit</b> outcomes. <b>Audit</b> <b>team</b> industry and client-specific experience have an incremental effect to audit firm tenure, on production effort. By finding that variations in the extent and nature of <b>audit</b> <b>team</b> experience impact <b>audit</b> outcomes, the thesis provides an explanation for the inconsistent results reported in partner tenure studies. In addition to its contributions to the literature, this thesis also has practical implications. Audit firms maintain their competitive edge through the selection, development and use of their auditors. The findings are relevant to audit firms as they have some latitude to manage their auditors’ experience and purposefully construct <b>audit</b> <b>teams</b> in order to gain experience-based performance benefits. It also provides evidence {{of the importance of the}} partner-client relationship...|$|R

30|$|Auditors {{have high}} {{knowledge}} and accountability levels. As task complexity increases, high-accountability audits are likely required {{to put in}} the ever more effort to apply the requisite knowledge (which they possess) to successfully perform the task in hand. Tan et al. (2002) suggested that when assigning auditors to highly complex tasks, CPA firms should ensure that the auditors have the requisite knowledge as well as the appropriate motivational level. Auditors assigned to “significant audit responsibilities should possess the knowledge, skill, and ability” to effectively complete those tasks. Specialization has become more important in the current auditing environment, and the <b>auditing</b> <b>team</b> characteristic has evolved into one of the crucial factors for audit quality. Rhee et al. (2013) found that the ability to work effectively on a team is highly valued by employers, and collaboration among employees can lead to intrinsic motivation, increased persistence, and greater transferability of skills. Vera-Muñoz et al. (2006) emphasized the importance of sharing knowledge and expertise among <b>auditing</b> <b>team</b> members to affect a favorable auditing outcome. Nelson and Tan (2005) stated that auditor knowledge and expertise are also associated with superior performance in an auditing, and experience affords opportunities to gain additional knowledge—which when combined with ability—positively affects performance. Consequently, assigning personnel with the appropriate levels of technical training and proficiency to audit engagements is required.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Obstetric {{near-miss}} case reviews {{are being}} promoted as a quality assurance intervention suitable for hospitals in low income countries. We introduced such reviews in five district, {{regional and national}} hospitals in Benin, West Africa. In a cross-sectional study we analysed {{the extent to which}} the hospital <b>audit</b> <b>teams</b> were able to identify case management problems (CMPs), analyse their causes, agree on solutions and put these solutions into practice. Methods We analysed case summaries, women’s interview transcripts and audit minutes produced by the <b>audit</b> <b>teams</b> for 67 meetings concerning one woman with near-miss complications each. We compared the proportion of CMPs identified by an external assessment team to the number found by the <b>audit</b> <b>teams.</b> For the latter, we described the CMP causes identified, solutions proposed and implemented by the <b>audit</b> <b>teams.</b> Results <b>Audit</b> meetings were conducted regularly and were well attended. <b>Audit</b> <b>teams</b> identified half of the 714 CMPs; they were more likely to find managerial ones (71 %) than the ones relating to treatment (30 %). Most identified CMPs were valid. Almost all causes of CMPs were plausible, but often too superficial to be of great value for directing remedial action. <b>Audit</b> <b>teams</b> suggested solutions, most of them promising ones, for 38 % of the CMPs they had identified, but recorded their implementation only for a minority (8. 5 %). Conclusions The importance of following-up and documenting the implementation of solutions should be stressed in future audit interventions. Tools facilitating the follow-up should be made available. Near-miss case reviews hold promise, but their effectiveness to improve the quality of care sustainably and on a large scale still needs to be established. </p...|$|R

Requirements of Section 203 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) [...] which mandates rotation of the <b>audit</b> <b>team</b> member who bears primary responsibility for the audit [...] began to take effect as recently as 2007 - 2008.

To aid in the prevention of knowledge loss and the facilitation of knowledge transfer from the outgoing to the incoming partner, we suggest four primary knowledge transfer approaches which may be used together in the post-SOX environment. These approaches are: (1) adequate planning of member rotation far in advance of the deadline for each partner; (2) consideration of strategic fit among the incoming partner, the client, the industry, and the team; (3) improved documentation of the outgoing partner's knowledge to be shared with the incoming partner; and (4) increased interaction among the rotating partners [...] outgoing and incoming [...] and the client to assist in the sharing of critical, yet difficult to transfer, tacit knowledge.

30|$|Auditing is {{a service}} profession. Due to many {{uncertainties}} of the auditing process and unobservable {{characteristics of the}} results, auditing is based on knowledge and experience with human resource as a key element (Knechel 2010). Knechel et al. (2013) stated that audit quality is conceived in different perspectives. For the economic supervision, the audit quality means no major mistakes in the financial report. For auditors, the audit is accomplished according to the methodology or guideline defined by the audit authorities to stand the challenges from the court. The public thinks that audit quality is to prevent a company or a market to cause social economic problems. In general, auditors are exposed to tasks of varying complexity and auditors are assigned to multiple engagements. The higher-complexity task involves {{a larger number of}} cues, and more cognitive effort is needed for encoding these cues. The higher-complexity task also involves more processing steps that require cognitive effort in retrieving the requisite knowledge and applying it to the task. The ability of an auditor to perform an auditing task is a major factor in assigning him or her to an <b>auditing</b> <b>team,</b> tasks in order to ensure quality in the conduct of the audit engagement. Thus, auditors need to share their knowledge and expertise about industry-specific trends as well as accounting, auditing, and regulatory issues that may impact the conduct and outcome of the respective <b>auditing</b> <b>team.</b>|$|E
