5|$|Electronic Logging Devices can {{be thought}} of as <b>an</b> <b>automated</b> {{electronic}} log book. An ELD records the same information as a manual paper log book, and requires less input from the driver. The ELD automatically records driving time and location, leaving the driver responsible only for reporting on-duty and off-duty time. In these respects, the ELD is less susceptible to forgery than a paper log book.|$|E

5|$|Later {{production}} Tu-144 versions {{were more}} refined and competitive. They had retractable canards for better low-speed control, turbojet engines providing nearly the fuel efficiency {{and range of}} Concorde and {{a top speed of}} Mach 2.35. Passenger service commenced in November 1977, but after the 1978 crash the aircraft was taken out of service. The aircraft had an inherently unsafe structural design as a consequence of <b>an</b> <b>automated</b> production method chosen to simplify and speed up manufacturing.|$|E
