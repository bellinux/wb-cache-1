30|$|Discussion: Due to the {{rarity of}} this {{clinical}} entity, its <b>adequate</b> <b>management</b> {{is not well}} established. Laparoscopic approach may be a valuable option, having in mind fertility preservation. It should be considered when medical therapy is unsuccessful.|$|R

40|$|Asthma is {{a chronic}} disease that {{requires}} <b>adequate</b> <b>management.</b> According to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology [AAAAI], 2015), 185 children had asthma-related deaths nationwide in 2007. In North Carolina public schools, asthma {{is the leading}} chronic health condition. Asthma is the primary disease process affecting children and {{the leading cause of}} school absenteeism in school-age children. A program evaluation of the asthma practices at a middle school and an elementary school in eastern North Carolina was conducted to ensure the program was following evidence-based practice. The evaluation found the program follows best practice, but the parents need to become more involved in their child’s care to ensure <b>adequate</b> <b>management...</b>|$|R
30|$|To conclude, {{despite the}} rarity of the condition, <b>adequate</b> <b>management</b> can be {{achieved}} by combining surgical treatment and further interventions currently used for the management of primary thyroid carcinoma. Long-term outcome for papillary variant seems to be more favourable than its follicular counterpart.|$|R
30|$|Another {{clinical}} problem {{not well}} resolved in pneumonias is to detect those patients that will develop complications such as pleural effusion or empyema.

30|$|Cavernous {{hemangioma}} of {{the appendix}} (CHA) is rare, and reports of CHA are limited {{and have been}} written in English, Russian, Japanese, German, and French [3 – 7].

40|$|Actinomyces meyeri {{is a rare}} {{pathogen}} and an infrequent {{cause of}} human actinomycosis. Less than ten cases were reported in the English-literature to date concerning A.  meyeri empyema. We herein report a case to promote the awareness and <b>adequate</b> <b>management</b> of the disease. A 44 -year-old immunocompetent male with known pulmonary disease was diagnosed with an A.  meyeri empyema. He underwent chest tube drainage and a short-term treatment with clindamycin for 4 months. This is the first report of a patient with structural pulmonary disease with an A.  meyeri empyema treated with 4 -month of clindamycin and chest tube drainage. In comparison to previous reports, our case was diagnosed early, empyema was effectively drained with one chest tube and symptoms and radiological findings were rapidly improved. Short-term antibiotic treatment can be well succeeded if an early diagnosis is made, {{there is no evidence}} of dissemination and <b>adequate</b> <b>management</b> is promptly instituted...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of improving access to early case detection and prompt and <b>adequate</b> <b>management</b> of acute episodes of malaria using school teachers was explored through an intervention trial in Ghana. Of all the 'fevers' diagnosed as presumptive malaria by the trained teachers, 93 % met the case definition. However, a lower proportion (75 %) of such correctly diagnosed cases were subsequently treated {{according to the}} treatment protocol provided. In a scaled up study, pre-packaging of the antimalarial drug improved the rate of adequate treatment to 97 % of cases correctly diagnosed as presumptive malaria. Pre-packaging of chloroquine ensured {{a high level of}} user compliance (96. 6 %), {{even in the face of}} diminished supervision of the teachers.
