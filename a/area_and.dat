The energy node agents represented for informatization involved in agent context were also constructed, network and grid of rural <b>areas</b> <b>and</b> agriculture information. In the study, 11 informatization node agents were given as the energy for the comprehensive evaluation of rural <b>areas</b> <b>and</b> agriculture information, which indicated the strength changes of rural <b>areas</b> <b>and</b> agriculture information. Correspondingly, the node process simulation of rural <b>areas</b> <b>and</b> agriculture information was explored from dual strategy mechanism driving. Then the agent energy transmission mode was put forward for 11 informatization node agent, after that three grades change status of energy transmission was displayed in the study, which responded to the gradient changes of rural <b>areas</b> <b>and</b> agriculture information. Moreover, the spatial process of 11 informatization nodes was obviously described by the agent simulation with the Repast-S IDE, and the unsealed link among node agents was also analyzed in the paper...|$|R
