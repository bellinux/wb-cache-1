5|$|A few early sets {{experimented with}} {{alternate}} art for cards. However, Wizards {{came to believe}} that this impeded easy recognition of a card and that having multiple versions caused confusion when identifying a card at a glance. Consequently, alternate art is now only used sparingly and mostly for promotional cards. When older cards are reprinted in new sets, however, Wizards of the Coast has guaranteed that they will be printed with new <b>art</b> <b>to</b> make the older cards more collectible.|$|E
40|$|First, we {{need the}} <b>arts</b> <b>to</b> express {{feelings}} words cannot convey. Second, {{we need the}} <b>arts</b> <b>to</b> stir creativity and enrich a student’s way of knowing. Third, we need the <b>arts</b> <b>to</b> integrate the fragments of academic life. Fourth, we need the <b>arts</b> <b>to</b> empower the disabled and give hope to the disenchanted. Above all, we need the <b>arts</b> <b>to</b> create community and to build connections across the generations...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the course}} of three years, Performing Arts Workshop and evaluators {{measured}} five goals of the Workshop's Artists-in-Schools program. These goals were: to improve student critical thinking in the <b>arts,</b> <b>to</b> use the <b>arts</b> <b>to</b> positively impact academic performance, to identify problems in teaching at-risk youth, <b>to</b> use the <b>arts</b> <b>to</b> develop pro-social behavior, and <b>to</b> institutionalize <b>arts</b> and arts education in school settings to increase sustainability. The ability of the Artists-in-Schools program to meet these goals is examined through a quasi-experimental, mixed-method research design in the following reports...|$|R

Because the thief has caused considerable damage to the J'nanin book, Atrus cannot accompany the Stranger.|$|E
5|$|As Magic has {{expanded}} across the globe, its artwork {{has had to}} change for its international audience. Artwork has been edited or given alternate <b>art</b> <b>to</b> comply with the governmental standards.

5|$|Convention {{programming}} includes presentations, panels, {{workshops and}} tutorials on anthropomorphic culture, from literature, fiction and <b>art</b> <b>to</b> science, technology and spirituality.

A unifying theme is common for larger events.|$|E

This edition was published under the alternate title Gregor and the Rats of the Underland.|$|E
5|$|The Baroque art was {{developing}} {{to a great}} extent under the patronage of the Catholic Church, which utilized the <b>art</b> <b>to</b> facilitate religious influence, allocating for this purpose the very substantial financial resources at its disposal. The most important in this context art form was architecture, with features rather austere at first, accompanied in due time by progressively more elaborate and lavish facade and interior design concepts.|$|E

In 2002, they carried a coffin marked The Death of Conceptual <b>Art</b> <b>to</b> the White Cube Gallery. In 2004 outside the launch of The Triumph of Painting at the Saatchi Gallery they wore tall hats with Charles Saatchi's face emblazoned and carried placards claiming that Saatchi had copied their ideas.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his life, Boydell {{dedicated}} time to civic projects: he donated <b>art</b> <b>to</b> {{government institutions}} {{and ran for}} public office.

5|$|Until recently, {{anthropologists have}} {{dominated}} the study of Navajo textiles. Most historic examples of these works belong to ethnological collections rather than fine art collections, which means items have been exhibited and analyzed {{with an eye toward}} normative or average works rather than emphasizing technical or artistic excellence. These priorities have artificially inflated the market value for items of inferior craftsmanship. In general, this tendency has affected most non-European <b>art</b> <b>to</b> some degree.|$|E

5|$|A man of {{progressive}} and relatively liberal ideas, Albert not only led reforms in university education, welfare, the royal finances and slavery, {{he had a}} special interest in applying science and <b>art</b> <b>to</b> the manufacturing industry. The Great Exhibition of 1851 arose from the annual exhibitions of the Society of Arts, of which Albert was President from 1843, and owed most of its success to his efforts to promote it. Albert {{served as president of the}} Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, and had to fight for every stage of the project. In the House of Lords, Lord Brougham fulminated against the proposal to hold the exhibition in Hyde Park. Opponents of the exhibition prophesied that foreign rogues and revolutionists would overrun England, subvert the morals of the people, and destroy their faith. Albert thought such talk absurd and quietly persevered, trusting always that British manufacturing would benefit from exposure to the best products of foreign countries.|$|E
5|$|According {{to local}} newspapers, Barrett left {{approximately}} £1.7million to {{his two brothers}} and two sisters. This sum was apparently largely acquired from royalties from Pink Floyd compilations and live recordings featuring songs he had written while with the band. A tribute concert called Games for May {{was held at the}} Barbican Centre, London on 10 May 2007 with Robyn Hitchcock, Captain Sensible, Damon Albarn, Chrissie Hynde, Kevin Ayers and his Pink Floyd bandmates performing. A series of events called The City Wakes was held in Cambridge in October 2008 to celebrate Barrett's life, art and music. Barrett's sister, Rosemary Breen, supported this, the first-ever series of official events in memory of her brother. After the festival's success, arts charity Escape Artists announced plans to create a centre in Cambridge, using <b>art</b> <b>to</b> help people suffering from mental health problems. A memorial bench has been placed in the Botanic Gardens in Cambridge and a more prominent tribute is planned in the city.|$|E
5|$|Colin Renfrew {{has pointed}} out the dangers of {{applying}} modern values of <b>art</b> <b>to</b> past societies and cultures. Günter Berghaus argues that these works have often been approached {{with a set of}} post-Renaissance aesthetic values that distinguish between artists and craftsman and art and artifact, although these categories are not universal and may be inappropriate for understanding prehistoric society. Duncan Garrow has pointed to the difficulties of the modern distinction drawn between form and decoration. The emphasis in studies of prehistoric art tend to be placed on decoration in objects such as ceramics and ignores the importance of form, found in objects such as weapons.|$|E
