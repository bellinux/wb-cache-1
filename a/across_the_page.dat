5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{is written}} primarily in insular majuscule with some occurrences of minuscule letters (usually e or s). The text is usually written in one long line <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>page.</b> Françoise Henry identified {{at least three}} scribes in this manuscript, whom she named Hand A, Hand B, and Hand C. Hand A is found on folios 1 through 19v, folios 276 through 289, and folios 307 {{through the end of}} the manuscript. Hand A, for the most part, writes eighteen or nineteen lines per page in the brown gall-ink common throughout the West. Hand B is found on folios 19r through 26 and folios 124 through 128. Hand B has a somewhat greater tendency to use minuscule and uses red, purple and black ink and a variable number of lines per page. Hand C is found throughout the majority of the text. Hand C also has greater tendency to use minuscule than Hand A. Hand C uses the same brownish gall-ink used by hand A and wrote, almost always, seventeen lines per page.|$|E

500|$|While Koch was {{touring the}} US, giving {{interviews}} {{to most of}} the major news channels, he met Kenneth W.

He later reported that [...] "everything looked wrong", including new-looking ink, poor quality paper and signatures that were [...] "terrible renditions" [...] of Hitler's. Rendell concludes the diaries were not particularly good fakes, calling them [...] "bad forgeries but a great hoax". He states that [...] "with the exception of imitating Hitler's habit of slanting his writing diagonally as he wrote <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>page,</b> the forger failed to observe or to imitate the most fundamental characteristics of his handwriting." ...|$|E

2500|$|While some of {{his poetry}} is free verse (with no concern for rhyme or meter), many have a {{recognizable}} sonnet structure of 14 lines, with an intricate rhyme scheme.

2500|$|Tilt {{and rotate}} {{movements}} are {{transferred to the}} ball carrier (the mechanism that supports the type element), which moves <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>page,</b> by two taut metal tapes, one for tilt and one for rotate. The tilt and rotate tapes are both anchored {{to the right side}} of the carrier. [...] They both wrap around separate pulleys at {{the right side of the}} frame; the tilt pulley is fixed, while the rotate pulley is attached to the shift arm, actuated by the Shift and Caps Lock keys. [...] The tapes extend across the machine behind the carrier, and then wrap around two separate pulleys at the left side of the frame. [...] The tilt tape is then anchored to a small, quarter-circle pulley which, through a link, tips the tilt ring (the device to which the type element is connected) to one of four possible locations. [...] The rotate tape is wrapped around a spring-loaded pulley located in the middle of the carrier. [...] The rotate pulley under the tilt ring is connected through a universal joint (called a [...] "dog bone", which it resembles) to the center of the tilt ring. [...] The type element is spring-latched onto that central post. [...] The type element rotates counter-clockwise when the rotate tape is tightened. [...] The spiral [...] "clock" [...] spring underneath the rotate pulley rotates the element in the clockwise direction. [...] As the carrier moves <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>page</b> (such as when it returns), the tapes travel over their pulleys, but the spring-loaded pulleys on the ball carrier do not pivot or rotate.|$|E
2500|$|A festival book is {{an account}} of festivities such as entries, {{of which there are}} many hundreds, often {{surviving}} in very few copies. [...] Originally manuscripts, often illustrated, compiled for prince or city, with the arrival of print they were frequently published, varying in form from short pamphlets describing the order of events, and perhaps recording speeches, to lavish books illustrated with woodcuts or engravings showing the various tableaux, often including a fold-out panorama of the procession, curling to and fro <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>page.</b> The pamphlets were ephemera themselves; a printed description of two leaves describing the entry of Ferdinand into Valladolid, 1513, survives in a single copy (at Harvard) because it was bound with another text. A lost description of the ceremonious reception given by Louis XII to Ferdinand at Savona (June 1507) is only known from a purchase receipt of Ferdinand Columbus.|$|E

2500|$|New {{cast members}} were told before being hired {{that they would}} be sworn to secrecy about the plot. According to {{producer}} Richard Stokes, some of the new cast were surprised at the requirement. [...] "What was really interesting was the new cast members saying 'what do you mean we won't know'. Some lead actors want to know what happens at the end so they can pitch their performance to it. In this they have to trust Chris and have to trust the directors." [...] Cast members swore not to reveal any details of series two, and were required to sign legally binding non-disclosure agreements. (The Daily Mail called them [...] "the most rigorous confidentiality agreements in the industry.") Daily call sheets used pseudonyms for cast members and characters. Scripts were individually watermarked to prevent them from being photocopied, used pseudonyms for characters, and were locked away by security guards when not in use by the actors. Each actor's or crew member's script had the individual's name watermarked <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>page</b> as well, so that leaks could {{be traced back to the}} person responsible.|$|E
2500|$|The {{plays of}} Euripides, {{like those of}} Aeschylus and Sophocles, were {{circulated}} in written form in the 5th century among literary {{members of the audience}} and performers at minor festivals, as aide-memoirs. However, literary conventions that we take for granted today had not yet been inventedthere was no spacing between words, no consistency in punctuation nor in vowel elisions, no marks for breathings and accent (guides to pronunciation and hence word recognition), no convention to denote change of speaker and no stage directions, and verse was written straight <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>page</b> like prose. Possibly those who bought texts supplied their own interpretative markings. Papyri discoveries have indicated, for example, that a change in speakers was loosely denoted with a variety of signs, such as the equivalent of the modern dash, colon and full-stop. The absence of modern literary conventions, which are an aid to comprehension, was an early and persistent source of errors affecting transmission of the text. Errors crept in also when Athens replaced its old Attic alphabet with the Ionian alphabet, a change sanctioned by law in 403–402 BC, adding a new complication to the task of copying. Many more errors came from the tendency of actors to interpolate words and sentences, producing so many corruptions and variations that a law was proposed by Lycurgus of Athens in 330 BC [...] "...that the plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides should be written down and preserved in a public office; and that the town clerk should read the text over with the actors; and that all performances which did not comply with this regulation should be illegal." [...] The law was soon disregarded and some actors continued to make their own changes up until about 200 BC, after which the habit dies out. It was about then that Aristophanes of Byzantium compiled an edition of all the extant plays of Euripides, collated from pre-Alexandrian texts, furnished with introductions and accompanied by a commentary that was [...] "published" [...] separately. This became the [...] "standard edition" [...] for the future and it featured some of the literary conventions that modern readers expectthere was still no spacing between words, little or no punctuation and no stage directions, but abbreviated names now denoted changes of speaker, lyrics are broken into [...] "cola' and [...] "strophai" [...] or lines and stanzas, and a system of accentuation was introduced.|$|E

30|$|The text {{placeholders}} are sequentially {{linked in}} each <b>page</b> template and <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>pages.</b> When <b>the</b> document contains a single sequence of content, a simple heuristic {{is to consider}} each headline occurring in the sequence {{as the beginning of}} a new “article”.

If the content is already split into several sequences, another approach is to simply associate every text placeholder to each sequence.|$|R
