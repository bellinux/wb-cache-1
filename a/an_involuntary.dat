5|$|Wallace is {{grateful}} for <b>an</b> <b>involuntary</b> stop in Bali, which he finds {{one of the}} most interesting places of his trip, as Hindu customs and religion are still practised, while on Lombok he finds Australian birds such as cockatoos, observing that this is the most westerly point of that family's range.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} may be hunted by birds of prey, infested by parasites such as fleas, or act as <b>an</b> <b>involuntary</b> {{host to the}} common cuckoo, but overall its {{population}} is large and stable, and it is therefore evaluated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Bigfin reef squids exhibit strong {{positive}} phototactic behaviour (attraction to light) {{and will}} move readily {{within a certain}} distance of a light source. Studies have proposed {{that this might be}} <b>an</b> <b>involuntary</b> stimulus behaviour, as the squids immediately stop all other movements once a light source is switched on. The colour of the light does not matter, but {{it has been shown that}} they react more strongly to underwater lights between the intensities of 1.5 to 2.5lx, with peak ranges of 2.5 to 10.0lx.|$|E
60|$|A splash followed. Grace gave <b>a</b> quick, <b>involuntary</b> nod and blink, {{and put her}} {{handkerchief}} to her face.|$|R
5000|$|... dartoic (dar·to·ic) (dahr-to'ik) of {{the nature}} of a dartos; having <b>a</b> slow, <b>involuntary</b> {{contractility}} like that of the dartos.|$|R
50|$|A spasm is <b>a</b> sudden <b>involuntary</b> {{contraction}} of <b>a</b> muscle, {{a group of}} muscles, or a hollow organ such as the heart.|$|R
5|$|In a B plot, Andy (Chris Pratt) {{is doing}} well in his new job as the Pawnee shoeshiner, and Ron pays for a shine. Ron is {{impressed}} when Andy actually eases the pain from his bunion, and he later purposely scuffs his shoe {{so he can get}} a second shine. Andy is initially flattered, but starts to grow uncomfortable when Ron returns for a third shoeshine. This time, Ron makes <b>an</b> <b>involuntary</b> noise that sounds like a sexual moan, seriously embarrassing both men. After a day of avoiding each other, Ron and Andy discuss the noise and decide {{it would be best to}} simply pretend it never happened.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the world}} {{are a variety of}} enemies, {{including}} standard fantasy monsters such as imps and goblins, and animals such as bears and wolves. Enemies become stronger and weapons and armor more effective as the player levels up. This game mechanic of level-scaling was incorporated to maintain a constant and moderate aspect of difficulty. However, level-scaling combined with the leveling system has received criticism, as {{it has the potential to}} unbalance the game; characters with major skills that increase on <b>an</b> <b>involuntary</b> basis, such as athletics or armor, can find that they level too quickly, making the enemies proportionately harder than intended.|$|E
5|$|Erik and Ashley begin dating, but {{on their}} first date at a restaurant, Erik has hot soup spilled accidentally on his legs, so Ashley brings him to her room to clean up. As Ashley rubs lotion on Erik's thigh, he {{develops}} <b>an</b> <b>involuntary</b> erection and accidentally ejaculates over her possessions. Erik apologizes and explains to Ashley that, after breaking up with Tracy, he has not ejaculated in four months, masturbation being a taboo in his house because of a previous incident. Meanwhile, Cooze {{falls in love with}} Ashley's roommate Denise; however, she is nervous about showing her genitalia and having sex with him, so she gives Cooze a handjob instead. After talking with Erik, Bobby, and Dwight about Denise, Cooze develops suspicions that Denise might have a penis, so Dwight encourages him to find out.|$|E
60|$|Dominey shivered {{a little}} with <b>an</b> almost <b>involuntary</b> repulsion. For {{the second time that}} almost satyr-like grin on Seaman's face revolted him.|$|R
5000|$|Supply-side approach: Jobless persons {{want to work}} at [...] or lower, but cannot make a {{credible}} promise not to shirk at such wages. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result <b>involuntary</b> unemployment occurs.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{one more}} place, Will." [...] <b>A</b> tender, <b>involuntary</b> droop {{in her voice}} betrayed her, and Will felt a wave of hot blood surge over him as the rest roared.|$|R
5|$|Set in 2090, {{the game}} is centred on a fictional extreme racing sport known as Ballistics, a {{descendant}} of Formula One. The player takes {{the role of a}} Ballistic's pilot, racing hoverbikes called speeders through the inside of tubes which form the courses. The speeders are magnetically attached to the race surface, allowing the player 360 degrees of movement along the left/right axis. The player can detach the speeder from the track and navigate down the center in order to avoid track obstacles and to acquire the power-ups exclusively located there. Players must try to follow the outside of each curve, as hitting the inside of a curve at speed could lead to <b>an</b> <b>involuntary</b> detachment, leading to a loss of control and seconds dropped in securing reattachment.|$|E
25|$|A {{termination}} {{initiated by}} the PBGC is sometimes called <b>an</b> <b>involuntary</b> termination.|$|E
25|$|A {{person may}} {{experience}} multiple orgasms, or <b>an</b> <b>involuntary</b> orgasm, {{such as in}} the case of rape or other sexual assault. <b>An</b> <b>involuntary</b> orgasm from forced sexual contact often results in feelings of shame caused by internalization of victim-blaming attitudes. The incidence of those who experience unsolicited sexual contact and experience orgasm is very low, though possibly under-reported due to shame or embarrassment; such orgasms additionally happen regardless of gender.|$|E
50|$|Advance {{psychiatric}} directives {{may have}} <b>a</b> bearing on <b>involuntary</b> commitment.|$|R
6000|$|... "I had rather he {{was like}} you, Papa," [...] sighed Kate. [...] "Oh, if I was but your child!" [...] she added, led on by <b>a</b> little <b>involuntary</b> {{pressure}} of his encircling arm.|$|R
60|$|Millicent flushed. Under the {{circumstances}} she {{was touched by}} the speaker's sincerity, and grateful for the way she expressed herself. Perhaps it was this which prompted her to <b>an</b> almost <b>involuntary</b> outpouring of confidence.|$|R
25|$|Sexual pain {{disorders}} affect women {{almost exclusively}} {{and are also}} known as dyspareunia (painful intercourse) or vaginismus (<b>an</b> <b>involuntary</b> spasm of {{the muscles of the}} vaginal wall that interferes with intercourse).|$|E
25|$|In 1987, {{a number}} of LaRouche entities, {{including}} the Fusion Energy Foundation, were taken over through <b>an</b> <b>involuntary</b> bankruptcy proceeding. The government's use of a sealed order in this proceeding {{was regarded as a}} rare legal maneuver.|$|E
25|$|Title IV {{created the}} Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) to insure {{benefits}} {{of participants in}} underfunded terminated plans. It also describes the procedures that a pension plan must follow to terminate itself, and for the PBGC to initiate <b>an</b> <b>involuntary</b> termination.|$|E
60|$|Ida and {{her father}} {{looked at each other}} in surprise, while the Colonel by <b>a</b> half <b>involuntary</b> {{movement}} stepped between his accuser and the door; and Ida noticed that his face was white with anger.|$|R
6000|$|He drank {{up all the}} tea at once in one draught. This {{performance}} was invariably followed by a slight shudder and <b>a</b> low, <b>involuntary</b> [...] "br-r-r-r," [...] which was {{not covered by the}} hasty exclamation, [...] "Excellent!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... exaggerated deep tendon {{reflexes}} including spasticity, and clonus (<b>a</b> {{series of}} <b>involuntary</b> rapid muscle contractions) ...|$|R
25|$|Objective {{tinnitus}} can {{be detected}} by other people and is sometimes caused by <b>an</b> <b>involuntary</b> twitching of a muscle {{or a group of}} muscles (myoclonus) or by a vascular condition. In some cases, tinnitus is generated by muscle spasms around the middle ear.|$|E
25|$|Abstinence may be {{voluntary}} (when {{an individual}} {{chooses not to}} engage in sexual activity due to moral, religious, philosophical, etc. reasons), <b>an</b> <b>involuntary</b> result of social circumstances (when one cannot find any willing sexual partners), or legally mandated (e.g. in countries where sexual activity outside marriage is illegal, in prisons etc.).|$|E
25|$|This {{was joined}} by some {{prominent}} feminists and suffragettes of the time, such as Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel. They, in addition to handing out the feathers, also lobbied to institute <b>an</b> <b>involuntary</b> universal draft, which included those who lacked votes due to being too young or not owning property.|$|E
60|$|<b>A</b> general half <b>involuntary</b> {{movement}} was now made, {{as if they}} were about to depart.|$|R
60|$|She took <b>a</b> deep, <b>involuntary</b> breath. The {{touch of}} {{lightness}} in his reply served {{to emphasize the}} hitherto unsuspected fact that sportsmanship in Trixton Brent was not merely a code, but assumed something of the grandeur of a principle.|$|R
5000|$|Kingmans {{battle with}} {{injuries}} has forced him into <b>a</b> temporary premature <b>involuntary</b> retirement from Representative Baseball.|$|R
25|$|Education of patients, families, and {{caregivers}} {{is an important}} component of the appropriate treatment of PBA. Crying associated with PBA may be incorrectly interpreted as depression; laughter may be embarrassing. It is therefore critical for families {{and caregivers}} to recognize the pathological nature of PBA and the reassurance that this is <b>an</b> <b>involuntary</b> syndrome that is manageable.|$|E
25|$|Synkinesis is {{the result}} from miswiring of nerves after trauma. This result is {{manifested}} through involuntary muscular movements accompanying voluntary movements. For example, voluntary smiling will induce <b>an</b> <b>involuntary</b> contraction of the eye muscles causing the eye to squint when smiling. Most commonly involved are facial muscles and the extraocular muscles, rarely the hands are performing mirror movements.|$|E
25|$|The {{shooting}} {{has been}} variously classified as <b>an</b> <b>involuntary</b> manslaughter since the officer later claimed {{he thought he}} was using his taser gun. On January 30, 2010, Alameda County prosecutors charged Mehserle with murder for the shooting. He resigned his position, and pleaded not guilty. The trial began on June 10, 2010. On July 8, 2010, Mehserle was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and not guilty of second-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter.|$|E
5000|$|A {{hearing is}} set {{before the court}} after <b>a</b> Petition for <b>Involuntary</b> Assessment and Stabilization is filed.|$|R
50|$|Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278, (1936), was a United States Supreme Court {{case that}} ruled that <b>a</b> defendant's <b>involuntary</b> {{confession}} that is extracted by police violence cannot be entered as evidence and violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|R
60|$|<b>A</b> pained, <b>involuntary</b> {{reluctance}} {{lingered in}} his tone, in his eyes, plain {{to the woman}} with the genius of sympathetic intuition. She averted her glance from the miserable subjection of the dying man, appalled, wishing to hear no more of the silver.|$|R
