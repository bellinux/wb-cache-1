40|$|Since the International Maritime Organization {{decided to}} revise its intact {{stability}} criteria from deterministic based criteria to be performance based one, some researches regarding the ship performance in waves {{have been conducted}} by several researches. One of the dangerous condition reccomended {{to be included in}} the criteria was the stability of ships in following waves especially for ship with small coefficient for vertical well-sidedness. Ships with large breadth and draught ratio tends to have large the coefficient for well-sidedness. However large roll angle may occur when the ships operate in large significant wave height. The forward speed also could have significant effect on the roll motion characteristics due to time spend of ship in a certain position relative to the wave. This paper discusses effect of restoring arm variation due to waves characteristics and ship speed on roll motion of ships with large breadth and draught ratio in following waves. The waves characteristics is modelled based on the Beaufort scale and the forward speed is estimated by changing the propeller revolution from 6 rps to 15 rps. The results of numerical simulation and discussions show that <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>roll</b> motion significantly affected by variation of the waterline area of the ship in sugging and hogging condition. The large roll angle can be avoided by increasing the forward speed with considering the other dangerous condition such as pure loss of stability and broaching...|$|E
40|$|In {{the unfortunate}} event that a naval vessel is damaged, {{decisions}} {{must be made}} regarding {{the reduction in the}} vessel’s capability and what damage control procedures can be initiated to both restore this capability and minimise further damage. In order to make an informed decision, it is vital that Commanding Officers (COs) have access to reliable information regarding the vessel’s structural integrity, stability and seakeeping performance. A reduction in any of these parameters may have a significant influence on the operability of the vessel. A preliminary program of work has been conducted to investigate the change in ship motions due to an angle of list induced on the vessel after sustaining damage. This study incorporates both experimental and numerical simulations of a listed vessel at rest in a seaway. During the experimental program several parameters were investigated to ascertain their influence on the vessel's motions. These parameters include initial list angle, direction of list and wave conditions. The results from this study show that for a vessel in beam seas there is no significant effect on vessel motions due to an angle of list. However, in head seas the introduction of an angle of list has a marked effect on the <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>roll</b> motions. The example operator guidance generated shows that numerical modelling {{can be applied to the}} analysis of the operability of a vessel against set limiting criteria.

40|$|Traditionally {{ships are}} {{designed}} to be symmetric about their centerline which makes head seas a very safe heading for roll motion stability. However, in the recent years several incidents of large amplitude roll motion in head seas have been reported which have later been attributed to parametric roll. Parametric roll motion is a phenomenon in which a ship exhibits a large <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>roll</b> motion even when it is moving into head seas with no direct excitation. This phenomenon is particularly an issue for modern high-speed fine form container ships and has gained attention relatively recently. This instability is dangerous because of its manifestation in counter-intuitive headings. Also the roll amplitude during parametric roll rises exponentially with time which gives ship captains and masters very less time to react. While this instability has been studied extensively in regular waves, its manifestation in irregular seas has not received sufficient attention. This dissertation aims at the development of design criteria based on analytical techniques which can help a designer quickly quantify the stability of a vessel to parametric excitation. For accurate simulation of parametric response of a vessel/platform in irregular seas, an in-house time domain simulation program has been developed and validated against available experiments. The roll equation of motion is then simplified into a single degree of freedom model for analytical assessment. The existing single degree of freedom models in the literature are compared against the time domain simulation tool to gain an understanding {{of the extent to which}} the simplified models capture the dynamics of the phenomenon. In order to improve the roll modeling, a new approach is suggested to overcome some of the limitations of the existing models. This new model is then investigated using two analytical approaches, one from the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems and the other from stochastic dynamics to come up with two independent measures of stability. Both of these measures are used to demonstrate their potential as a design criteria which can be used by a ship designer. A comparison of the two methods for a variety of cases is undertaken to demonstrate the similar trends they exhibit...|$|E

40|$|Three sets of {{experiments}} with small fishing vessel models in biased condition were {{conducted at the}} towing tank of Memorial University of Newfoundland. A simulation of the asymmetric rolling motion {{of one of the}} models in beam waves without forward speed was also performed. [...] The first set {{of experiments}} was carried out with three fishing vessel models denoted by M 363, M 365 and M 366 to measure the roll damping. Hundreds of decay curves were obtained from free roll tests for the analysis of biased roll damping coefficient. The Energy Approach developed by Haddara [10] was applied in the analysis. The results show that the nondimensional equivalent linear damping coefficient ζΕ increases linearly with average <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>roll</b> angle. The effect of bias angle on roll damping varies from model to model. In the case of M 366, ζΕ increases linearly with bias angle. The same tendency is seen for M 365 when its roll amplitude is larger than ten degrees. However, ζΕ decreases with bias angle when the roll amplitude is lower than ten degrees. In the case of M 363, the damping coefficient ζΕ shows a nonlinear relationship with bias angle for low roll amplitude, i. e. ζΕ decreases with bias angle first, then increases. For the large roll amplitude, ζΕ increase with bias angle almost linearly. [...] The second set of experiments was carried out with M 363 in regular beam waves without forward speed. The model was tethered in drift and yaw but all other modes were free. The model was set under two different bias conditions and was tested both biased towards the wave source (wave maker) and away from the wave source. The results indicate that the effect of bias angle is pretty slight. [...] The last set of experiments was performed also with M 363 in beam waves without forward speed but the model was restrained through a pivot in every mode except for roll. The pivot was placed at the model's roll center in the first group of tests; for the second group of tests, the pivot was transversely moved to a new position whose transverse coordinate is the model's actual center of gravity and vertical coordinate was unchanged. The results can be summarized as follows. [...] When the model was biased towards the wave source the roll amplitude was much larger, compared with when the model was biased away from the wave source or under no bias condition. [...] In the frequency domain, the roll amplitudes show a strong resonant phenomenon when the model is biased towards the wave source or under no bias condition. On the other hand, the curve of roll amplitude with respect to the wave frequency is fairly flat when the model is biased away from the wave source. [...] The results do not reflect any significant effect of pivot position. This is believed to be due to the very small distance between two pivot positions. [...] The results from the simulation of the rolling motion of the biased M 363 under restrained conditions show reasonable agreement with experimental results, especially for the tendency of roll amplitudes with respect to the wave frequency. It is also indicated by the simulation that not only bias and wave direction but restraints are factors which make the roll amplitude large when the model is biased towards wave source...|$|E

The effect of stratification on the finite-amplitude longitudinal rolls developing in the Ekman flow and their three-dimensional stability is studied by means of linearized and nonlinear numerical simulations. Similarities and differences with respect to billows developing in the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) unidirectional stratified shear flow are discussed. Prandtl number effects are investigated {{as well as the}} role played by the buoyant-convective instability. For low Prandtl number, the <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> the saturated <b>rolls</b> vanishes at the critical bulk Richardson number, while at high Prandtl number, finite-amplitude rolls are found. The Prandtl number also affects how the growth rate of the secondary instability evolves as the Richardson number is increased. For low Prandtl number, the growth rate decreases as the Richardson number increases while it remains significant for large Prandtl number over the range of stratification studied. This behaviour is likely a result <b>of</b> the differing <b>amplitudes</b> <b>of</b> the <b>roll</b> vortices. Furthermore, the most unstable wave vector is much lower than for the secondary instability of KH billows. Examination of the energetics of the secondary instability shows that buoyant-convective instability is present locally at high Reynolds and Prandtl numbers but plays an overall minor role despite the presence in the base flow of statically unstable regions characterized by a high Richardson number. © 2013 Cambridge University Press...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDamping plays a {{significant}} role on the maximum <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> a vessel's <b>roll</b> motion, in particular near the resonant frequency. It is a common practice to predict roll damping using a linear radiation–diffraction code and add that to a linearized viscous damping component, which can be obtained through empirical, semi-empirical equations or free decay tests in calm water. However, it is evident that the viscous roll damping is nonlinear with roll velocity and amplitude. Nonlinear liquid cargo motions inside cargo tanks also contribute to roll damping, which when ignored impedes the accurate prediction <b>of</b> maximum <b>roll</b> motions. In this study, a series of free decay model tests is conducted on a barge-like vessel with two spherical tanks, which allows a better understanding <b>of</b> the nonlinear <b>roll</b> damping components considering the effects of the liquid cargo motion. To examine the effects of the cargo motion on the damping levels, a nonlinear model is adopted to calculate the damping coefficients. The liquid cargo motion is observed to affect both the linear and the quadratic components <b>of</b> the <b>roll</b> damping. The flow memory effect on the roll damping is also studied.

40|$|International audienceOcular counter-rolling (OCR) {{induced by}} whole body tilt in roll has been {{explored}} after spaceflight {{as an indicator}} of the adaptation of the otolith function to microgravity. It has been claimed that the overall pattern of OCR responses during static body tilt after spaceflight is indicative of a decreased role of the otolith function, but the results of these studies have not been consistent, mostly due to large variations in the OCR within and across individuals. By contrast with static head tilt, off-vertical axis rotation (OVAR) presents the advantage of generating a sinusoidal modulation of OCR, allowing averaged measurements over several cycles, thus improving measurement accuracy. Accordingly, OCR and the sense <b>of</b> <b>roll</b> tilt were evaluated in seven astronauts before and after spaceflight during OVAR at 45 degrees/s in darkness at two angles of tilt (10 degrees and 20 degrees). There {{was no significant difference in}} OCR during OVAR immediately after landing compared to preflight. However, the <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> the perceived <b>roll</b> tilt during OVAR was significantly larger immediately postflight, and then returned to control values in the following days. Since the OCR response is predominantly attributed to the shearing force exerted on the utricular macula, the absence of change in OCR postflight suggests that the peripheral otolith organs function normally after short-term spaceflight. However, the increased sense <b>of</b> <b>roll</b> tilt indicates an adaptation in the central processing of gravitational input, presumably related to a re-weighting of the internal representation of gravitational vertical as a result of adaptation to microgravity...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study has}} been made {{to determine the effects of}} mass-loading variations and onboard rotating machinery on a hypothetical earth-satellite space station, rotating to provide an artificial gravity equal to one-fourth of that at the earth's surface. Attempts were also made to damp out or minimize undesirable motions by using mass shifts, constant-rate inertia wheels, or jet-reaction moments. Results obtained indicate that the shifting of masses within the rotating space station could bring about large roll oscillations (plus or minus 100 degrees) or even continuous rolling motions if the craft is rotating about the axis of intermediate moment of inertia. The pitch angles obtained were generally small (less than plus or minus 1 degree). The <b>amplitudes</b> <b>of</b> the <b>roll</b> and pitch oscillations are dependent upon the angle of displacement of the greatest principal axis of inertia from the initial spin axis. In attempting to damp out or minimize undesirable motions, it was found that a constant-rate inertia wheel located on and rotating about the axis about which the craft is rotating (Z-axis) was beneficial in keeping the roll angles relatively small, provided it had a sufficient amount of angular momentum.

There are few detection methods which including rolling velocity.

The model tests examine the ship in head- and bow-sea waves in the zone of the first parametric resonance. Numerically, it is adopted a 3 D Domain-Decomposition (DD) strategy combining a weakly-nonlinear potential-flow solver based on the weak-scatterer theory with a shallow-water approximation for the shipped liquid and with a bottom-slamming solution. Detailed comparisons against these and other seakeeping experiments validated the numerical method in its different aspects with global success. At first, a 2 -dof equivalent linearized yaw-roll coupled system is examined and the measurements are used to estimate hydrodynamic coefficients required to complete the mathematical model of the problem. Then the DD method is applied to verify the instability occurrence and compared against the experiments. From the analysis, the parametric-roll instability does not occur if all nonlinearities in the roll restoring load are not accounted for. However the <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> the resonant <b>roll</b> is affected by the coupling with the other degrees of freedom.

M. sexta sideslip by rolling their entire body and wings to reorient their net force vector. During sideslip they increase net aerodynamic force by flapping with greater amplitude, (in both wing elevation and sweep), {{allowing them to}} continue to support body weight while rolled. To execute the roll maneuver we observed in sideslips, they use an asymmetric wing stroke; increasing the pitch of the roll-contralateral wing pair, while decreasing that of the roll-ipsilateral pair. They also increase the wing sweep <b>amplitude</b> <b>of,</b> and decrease the elevation <b>amplitude</b> <b>of,</b> the contralateral wing pair relative to the ipsilateral pair. The roll maneuver unfolds in a stairstep manner, with orientation changing more during downstroke than upstroke. This is due to smaller upstroke wing pitch angle asymmetries as well as increased upstroke flapping counter-torque from left-right differences in global reference frame wing velocity about the moth's roll axis. Rolls are also opposed by stabilizing aerodynamic moments from lateral motion, such that rightward roll velocity will be opposed by rightward motion. Computational modeling using blade-element approaches confirm the plausibility of a causal linkage between the previously mentioned wing kinematics and roll/sideslip. Model results also predict high degrees of axial and lateral damping. On the time scale of whole and half wing strokes, left-right wing pair asymmetries directly relate to the first, but not second, derivative <b>of</b> <b>roll.</b> Collectively, these results strongly support a roll-based sideslip {{with a high degree}} <b>of</b> <b>roll</b> damping in M. sexta...|$|R

We identify two important factors of the mean HBL wind that affect the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>rolls.</b> The dynamical HBL height affects the wavelength <b>of</b> <b>rolls,</b> and {{the magnitude of the}} mean wind shear affects the growth rate <b>of</b> <b>rolls.</b> As a result, under neutrally stratified HBL, the wavelength <b>of</b> <b>rolls</b> increases with the radius (out of the radius of maximum wind), while the growth rate <b>of</b> <b>rolls</b> decreases. The stratification also {{plays an important role in}} the generation <b>of</b> <b>rolls.</b> The stable stratification suppresses the growth <b>of</b> <b>rolls</b> because <b>of</b> the negative work done by the buoyancy force. Nonuniform stratification with a mixed layer has less suppressing effect on rolls. Rolls can trigger internal waves in the stably stratified layer, which have both vertically propagating and decaying properties. We derive analytical solutions for the internal waves, which relate the properties of the internal waves to the boundary layer rolls. We find the properties of the internal waves are affected by the mixed-layer height...|$|R
