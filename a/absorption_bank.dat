The contribution is based on combining some conceptual elements with some empirical aspects, bank merging and acquisitions represent a worldwide present-day process, having a great impact also on the Romanian banking market, on banking financial institutions, which, in order to face competition, have oriented their strategies for diversifying risks, for offering services to global customers, by means of bank merging and acquisitions.

40|$|Over the years, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has {{established}} margin regulations to limit purpose loans by banks and nonbanks to broker-dealers or other borrowers. In this study, the author reviews those regulations affecting security lending by banks and nonbanks. He examines data on security loans during the 1920 s and 1930 s, {{as well as}} in recent years, noting that security lending by banks and borrowing by broker-dealers often diverge-the popular notion that the two are tightly linked is not correct-and that during the 1920 s the volume of loans by banks to brokers may have been driven less by margin loans than by new issues of stocks and bonds by corporations. Also, during the 1928 - 29 episode, security loans by nonbank lenders, domestic and foreign, became increasingly important. The author points out that these observations have recent parallels.; The author also looks at the credit absorption hypothesis popular in the 1930 s, which argues that margin loans diverted credit from legitimate business uses to speculation, thereby weakening the financial positions of businesses. While the credit absorption view suggests that an increase in bank security loans should result in higher business loan rates relative to other short-term interest rates, the author finds no such effect. He concludes that the recent evidence suggests no credit <b>absorption</b> from <b>bank</b> security loans.

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{strategic}} groups predicts {{the existence of}} stable groups of companies that adopt similar business strategies. The theory also predicts that groups will differ in performance and in their reaction to external shocks. We use cluster analysis to identify strategic groups in the Polish banking sector. We find stable groups in the Polish banking sector constituted after the year 2000 following the major privatisation and ownership changes connected with transition to the mostly-privately-owned banking sector in the late 90 s. Using panel regression methods we show that the allocation of banks to groups is statistically significant in explaining the profitability of banks. Thus, breaking down the banks into strategic groups and allowing for the different reaction of the groups to external shocks helps in a more accurate explanation of profits of the banking sector as a whole. Therefore, a more precise ex ante assessment of the loss <b>absorption</b> capabilities of <b>banks</b> is possible, which is crucial for an analysis of banking sector stability.

The data were taken from Bank Indonesia, Investment Coordinating Board, and the Central Bureau of Statistics. This is a time series data of 2002 to 2006. It shows that the financing of investment to GDP has significant and negative effect, financing of investment to labor absorption has signifi-cant and negative effect; financing working capital to GDP has significant and positive effect; financing of working capital to labor absorption has significant and negative effect; GDP in the labor market has no significant nor positive effect; GDP for the welfare effect, it has positive but not significant effect; employment in the welfare has a significant and positive effect. The direct effect or indirect implementation of financing from banks to finance investments and working capital to the entrepreneurs has increasingly a significant and positive effect.

40|$|ABSTRACT In todayâ€™s {{competitive}} and constantly changing environment many researchers {{claim that it}} is important for organizations to innovate in order to survive. As most of this innovation is a source of the creative thoughts of individual employees, it is significant for any organization to ensure employees work under such conditions that would enhance and promote their creative thought. This study examined the characteristics of the work environment at the Bank of Cyprus and the perceptions of its personnel, before and after a major crisis which included the <b>absorption</b> of another <b>bankâ€™s</b> assets including its personnel, branch closures, salary reductions and a voluntary retirement scheme. The purpose of this research was to identify changes in the work environment and in personnel perceptions {{as a result of the}} crisis and how these changes could have affected creativity and innovation among employees. Semi-structured interviews were held among a sample of 15 bank employees from different areas of the Bank and thematic analysis was performed that identified five major themes of importance. Specifically, in relation to the five themes which are limited organizational encouragement towards creative thought, limited resources to support creativity and innovation, changing relationships with management, team role changes and shift in perceptions and emotions, employees perceived worsening of conditions after the crisis and, as a consequence, a negative effect on creativity and innovation. Most mentioned changes in the work environment as a result of the crisis included extensive time pressure, decrease of perceived leadership support, problems in team adaptation to the new situation and the development of negative feelings and emotions, most notably fear and insecurity. The evaluation of personnel perceptions of the changes in the work environment of the Bank after the crisis, indicate that such a crisis could be associated mostly with negative effects on creativity and innovation...|$|R

Second, if consolidation occurs through the merger of banking organizations in different markets, it may increase the geographic scope of bank operations -that is, the extent to which banks operate over wide areas within and across state lines. And third, if consolidation occurs through the merger of banking organizations within the same market, it may increase the concentration of local markets -that is, the tendency for markets to be dominated by a few banks. Analysts agree each of these effects is important to bank owners and customers but disagree as to whether each effect is beneficial or harmful on balance. > Keeton examines whether consolidation has had these effects, and if so, to what degree for Tenth District states. He concludes that consolidation has reduced the role of small banks, increased geographic diversity, and increased local market concentration.

5000|$|On February 2, 1909, Consolidated National Bank {{ratified}} a plan {{to acquire}} the Oriental Bank [...] "by allowing its shareholders {{to subscribe to the}} shares of a new institution at $150 a share." [...] The Oriental Bank had closed the year prior, but had paid its depositors in full. The new institution, to be named the National Reserve Bank, combined aspects of both banks. A special meeting was called for February 18 for final ratification by stockholders. On February 18, 1909, the bank stockholders voted to enact the merger proposed by the directors, to take over the assets of Oriental Bank and merge them with Consolidated, creating the National Reserve Bank of the City of New York. The plan increased capital of the bank from $1,000,000 to $1,200,000. At the same meeting, 23 directors were elected to the new board, including E. A. Fisher and Mortimer H. Wagar. The bank planned to keep the Consolidated name operative until March 1, 1909. On March 2, 1909, Will-tarn O. Allison (W.O. Allison), president of Consolidated National Bank, was voted president of the new National Reserve Bank entity formed by Consolidated's <b>absorption</b> of Oriental <b>Bank's</b> assets. Thomas J. Lewis and R. W. Jones Jr. were elected vice presidents, and George W. Adams, cashier. With the merger of the reorganized Oriental Bank with the Consolidated National Bank of New York, capital was increased from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000. The National Reserve Bank of the City of New York formally opened its doors for business on March 8, 1909, at [...] "the old banking quarters of the Oriental Bank" [...] at 182 Broadway, corner of John Street in Manhattan, until new facilities at the City Investing Building could be completed at 165 Broadway. [...] In late April 1909, the National Reserve Bank, formerly named Consolidated National Bank, opened for business in the City Investing Building.|$|R

The Global Economic Governance Initiative (GEGI) is a research program of the Center for Finance, Law & Policy, the Frederick S. Pardee Center for the Study of the Longer-Range Future, and the Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies. It was founded in 2008 to advance policy-relevant knowledge about governance for financial stability, human development, and the environment. Since its accession into the European Union in 2007, Romania has consistently fallen short of its development objectives for the 2007 - 2013 period. Of particular concern is Romaniaâ€™s repeated failure to obtain sufficient and sustainable fiscal and financial resources for domestic development. While discussion and analysis of underlying problems has been prolific, the obscurity, generality, and uncoordinated nature of proposed solutions continue to hinder progress. 1 With these shortcomings in mind, this paper uses case studies, personal interviews, and policy analysis to examine two key aspects of development finance: EU funds <b>absorption,</b> and development <b>banking.</b> Following the examination are specific recommendations on how Romania should address the issues at hand {{in order to improve}} development financing over the 2014 â€“ 2020 period. Regarding EU funds, steps to mimic the successful absorption models of Poland and Czech Republic through regionalization of fund management have failed due to insufficient interparty dialogue, political deadlock, barriers to skills diffusion, and inadequate resources for monitoring. The evidence suggests that instead of regionalization, a centralized and coordinated approach to EU fund management should be taken via management authority consolidation. Additionally, clear priorities for EU fund use and a set of best practices regarding risk assessment should be implemented so that banks, applicants, and government ministries are on the same page in terms of project acceptability. To facilitate transparent, coordinated, and successful EU funds use, management should be consolidated into two development banks. While capitalizing a new bank would be difficult, if not infeasible, the existing capital and financial infrastructure vested in the two public banks, ExIm Bank and CEC Bank, is sufficient to meet current needs. Specifically, ExIm Bank should expand operations and take on the role of managing authority for funds allocated to long-term infrastructure development, export-oriented SMEs, and long-term agricultural investment. CEC Bank should take on the role of managing authority for funds allocated to human capital development, agriculture, and domestic SMEs. The transition should begin with ExIm Bank as a two-year trial and be expanded to CEC Bank, which presently faces greater volatility in terms of stakeholder view of future operations.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{proposed}} to myself to analyse the main bank acquisitions and mergers from Romania after 1989, causes {{that led to}} their appearance, their effects on the bank system and their future perspectives on the Romanian bank market. In the context of adherence to the European bank system a solution for the Romanian banks is the concentration of the bank system by mergers and acquisitions or the increase of the bank capitals because {{in the period of}} transition the smaller banks are vulnerable, donâ€™t dispose of an infrastructure that would alow them to offer financial services comparable to those offered by the great bank groups, canâ€™t offer large credits and is addressing to the smaller and average enterprise, which in their turn are exposed to all the shocks that are felt in the economy. The strategies of concentration and consolidation applied by the banks in this period implemented by the transactions with mergers and acquisitions are essential because of their success depends the existence of the bank, the rank it will have on the market, the profit of the bank, the efficiency, the increase of the satisfaction degree of the clients and the increase of the sharesâ€™ value. The increase of the interest of the investor in mergers and acquisitions determined the creating of the great financial conglomerates that offer a large range of services, operates simultaneously on many markets and include beside the bank activity insurance, leasing subsidiaries, investment funds, pension funds, subsidiaries specialized in credit saving. In the last decades the Romanian bank financial system suffered significant changes, registering an ample consolidation process, the number of bank institutions decreased and {{in the context of the}} present financial crisis, the continuing of the process of restructuring is anticipated. The main reason for choosing this subject if the fact that in the evolution of the concentration the bank mergers and acquisitions have a special purpose, they are necessary operations of draining the bank life by the <b>absorption</b> of the <b>banks</b> without stability by those with potential of economical and managerial stable capital. It is well known that the great banks, very strong and well consolidated created in the process of mergers and acquisitions have another potential in maintenance of the flux of profit and the balanced increase of the profitableness, having a great impact on the economy. The contribution consists in combining some conceptual elements with some empirical aspects, with the process of bank concentration created by acquisitions and fusions that leads to the elimination of some bank entitites that are not credible and stable and maintenance of those that are efficient, useful and credible for the client and for the Romanian society.
