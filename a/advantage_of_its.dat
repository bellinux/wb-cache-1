5|$|A scout alerted Muhammad of the Meccan army's {{presence}} and numbers late on Thursday March 21. The next morning, a Muslim conference of war convened, {{and there was}} dispute over how to best repel the Meccans. Muhammad {{and many of the}} senior figures suggested that it would be safer to fight within Medina and take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> heavily fortified strongholds. Younger Muslims argued that the Meccans were destroying their crops, and that huddling in the strongholds would destroy Muslim prestige. Muhammad eventually conceded to the wishes of the latter, and readied the Muslim force for battle.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 16thcentury, the town became an important trading port. The town took <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> east coast location, which facilitated trading contacts with the Low Countries, the Baltic region, England, and Northern France. The feu-ferme charter of 1451 between the Abbot of Dunfermline and the burgesses of Kirkcaldy mentioned a small but functioning harbour; it is not known when this harbour was established, or whether it was always located {{at the mouth of the}} East Burn. According to treasurers' accounts of the early 16thcentury, timber imported via the harbour—possibly from the Baltic countries—was used at Falkland Palace and Edinburgh Castle, as well as in shipbuilding. Raw materials such as hides, wool, skins, herring, salmon, coal and salt were exported from the town until well into the 17thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Flanders {{was noted}} for {{introducing}} a 1954 {{motion in the}} Senate to censure Senator Joseph McCarthy. McCarthy had made sensational claims that there were large numbers of Communists and Soviet spies and sympathizers inside {{the federal government and}} elsewhere. He used his Senate committee as a nationally televised forum for attacks on individuals whom he accused. Flanders felt that McCarthy’s attacks distracted the nation from a much greater threat of Communist successes elsewhere in the world and that they had the effect of creating division and confusion within the United States, to the <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> enemies. Ultimately, McCarthy's tactics and his inability to substantiate his claims led to his being discredited and censured by the United States Senate.|$|E
5|$|Sterling Products, {{equipped}} {{with all of}} Bayer's U.S. intellectual property, tried to take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> new brand as quickly as possible, before generic ASAs took over. However, without German expertise to run the Rensselaer plant to make aspirin and the other Bayer pharmaceuticals, they had only a finite aspirin supply and were facing competition from other companies. Sterling president William E. Weiss had ambitions to sell Bayer aspirin {{not only in the}} U.S., but to compete with the German Bayer abroad as well. Taking advantage of the losses Farbenfabriken Bayer (the German Bayer company) suffered through the reparation provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, Weiss worked out a deal with Carl Duisberg to share profits in the Americas, Australia, South Africa and Great Britain for most Bayer drugs, in return for technical assistance in manufacturing the drugs.|$|E

5|$|The Blackburn Firebrand was a British {{single-engine}} strike fighter for the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy designed during World War II by Blackburn Aircraft. Originally {{intended to}} serve as a pure fighter, its unimpressive performance and the allocation of its Napier Sabre piston engine by the Ministry of Aircraft Production for the Hawker Typhoon caused it to be redesigned as a strike fighter to take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> load-carrying capability. Development was slow and the first production aircraft was not delivered until {{after the end of the}} war. Only a few hundred were built before it was withdrawn from front-line service in 1953.|$|E
5|$|With many {{residents}} employed at the expansive Newport News Shipbuilding, the joint U.S. Air Force-U.S. Army installation at Joint Base Langley–Eustis, {{and other military}} bases and suppliers, the city's economy is very connected to the military. The location on the harbor and along the James River facilitates a large boating industry which can take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> many miles of waterfront. Newport News {{also serves as a}} junction between the rails and the sea with the Newport News Marine Terminals located at the East End of the city. Served by major east-west Interstate Highway 64, it is linked to others of the cities of Hampton Roads by the circumferential Hampton Roads Beltway, which crosses the harbor on two bridge-tunnels. Part of the Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport is in the city limits.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the mid-1930s, Orizaba {{often carried}} {{gold and silver}} bars from Veracruz to New York for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Chase National Bank, or for later {{transshipment}} to London. In October 1933 three short tons (2.7tonnes) of gold bars and coins were shipped on Orizaba for eventual delivery to London, prompting some to believe that gold was being smuggled into Mexico to take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> policy of not charging duties on gold. In July 1934 Orizaba brought in 16cases of Mexican gold, and in January 1935, 20cases; in both instances, for delivery to Chase National Bank. Twice in 1935, the Ward liner delivered over 1,000bars of silver for the Federal Reserve Bank, bringing 1,390bars in March, and 1,933bars in July. Mexico {{was not the only}} place from which Orizaba delivered precious metals. In March 1934, she delivered 12cases of gold—consisting of 84 bars, and worth $1,624,000—from Havana for Chase.|$|E

5|$|Finucane claimed {{three more}} successes in the spring, one Fw 190 on 26 March escorting 24 Douglas A-20 Havocs from 88 and 107 squadrons to attack Le Havre docks; another on 28 March and one Bf 109 and another Fw 190 on 17 May 1942. Four {{aircraft}} were claimed as shared, two probably destroyed and four damaged. Life magazine filmed the squadron's sortie on 26 March, as the fighters {{took off and}} landed. This operation was significant as Finucane's unit was also making use of gun camera footage to help verify combat claims. Finucane used footage to verify two claims on 2 April. Despite two clear images of two Fw 190s being hit he was credited only with one damaged. 602 was prompted to use the cameras because the Command thought the squadron's claims were excessive and the pilots were over stating their success. The Air Ministry also accelerated a plan to introduce the Spitfire IX to restore qualitative parity with the Fw 190 which was inflicting heavy losses on British fighter formations; primarily through German pilots taking full <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> superior performance over the Spitfire V. Finucane took at least one flight in the Spitfire IX. He flew the personal aircraft of commanding officer W. G. G. Duncan Smith, 64 Squadron, on 26 June 1942.|$|E
5|$|From the 1880s the LNC began a more {{aggressive}} programme to maximise its income. The process {{for the sale of}} surplus land was improved, resulting in increased income. The LNC redeveloped its lands at Hook Heath, Woking into housing and a golf course, creating a new suburb of Woking and providing a steady income from rentals. After an 1884 ruling that cremation was lawful in England the LNC also took <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> proximity to Woking Crematorium by providing transport for bodies and mourners on its railway line and after 1910 by interring ashes in a dedicated columbarium. The LNC also provided the land for a number of significant military cemeteries and memorials at Brookwood after both of the World Wars. In 1941 London Necropolis railway station, the LNC's London railway terminus, was badly damaged by bombing, and the London Necropolis Railway was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|In 393 BC, Conon and Pharnabazus {{sailed to}} {{mainland}} Greece, where they raided {{the coast of}} Laconia and seized the island of Cythera, where they left a garrison and an Athenian governor. They then sailed to Corinth, where they distributed money and urged {{the members of the}} council to show the Persian king that they were trustworthy. Pharnabazus then dispatched Conon with substantial funds and {{a large part of the}} fleet to Attica, where he joined in the rebuilding of the long walls from Athens to Piraeus, a project that had been initiated by Thrasybulus in 394 BC. With the assistance of the rowers of the fleet, and the workers paid for by the Persian money, the construction was soon completed. Athens quickly took <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> possession of walls and a fleet to seize the islands of Scyros, Imbros, and Lemnos, on which it established cleruchies (citizen colonies).|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} senior Bowie died circa 1820, he gave ten slaves {{as well as}} horses and cattle to both James and Rezin. For the next seven years, the {{brothers}} worked together to develop several large estates in Lafourche Parish and Opelousas. Louisiana's population was growing rapidly, and the brothers hoped to take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> rising land prices through speculation. Without the capital required to buy large tracts, they entered into a partnership with pirate Jean Lafitte in 1818 to raise money. By then, the United States had outlawed the importation of slaves, and most southern states allowed anyone who informed on a slave trader to receive half of what the imported slaves would earn at auction as a reward. Bowie made three trips to Lafitte's compound on Galveston Island. On each occasion, he bought smuggled slaves and took them directly to a customhouse to inform on his own actions. When the customs officers offered the slaves for auction, Bowie purchased them and received back half the price he had paid, as allowed by the state laws. He then could legally transport the slaves and resell them at a greater market value in New Orleans or areas farther up the Mississippi River. Using this scheme, the brothers collected $65,000 {{to be used for}} their land speculation.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} marine mammals, the sea otter has no blubber and relies on its {{exceptionally}} thick fur to keep warm. With up to 150,000 {{strands of hair}} per square centimeter (nearly one million per sqin), its fur is the densest of any animal. The fur consists of long, waterproof guard hairs and short underfur; the guard hairs keep the dense underfur layer dry. Cold water is kept completely away from the skin and heat loss is limited. The fur is thick year-round, as it is shed and replaced gradually {{rather than in a}} distinct molting season. As the ability of the guard hairs to repel water depends on utmost cleanliness, the sea otter has the ability to reach and groom the fur on any part of its body, taking <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> loose skin and an unusually supple skeleton. The coloration of the pelage is usually deep brown with silver-gray speckles, but it can range from yellowish or grayish brown to almost black. In adults, the head, throat, and chest are lighter in color {{than the rest of the}} body.|$|E
