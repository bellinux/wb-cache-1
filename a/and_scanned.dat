5|$|Cathodoluminescence (CL) — light {{emission}} excited by electron beam — {{is a process}} commonly observed in TV screens. An electron beam can be finely focused <b>and</b> <b>scanned</b> across the studied material. This technique is widely used to study defects in semiconductors and nanostructures with nanometer-scale spatial resolution. It would be beneficial to apply this technique to carbon nanotubes. However, no reliable CL, i.e. sharp peaks assignable to certain (n,m) indices, has been detected from carbon nanotubes yet.|$|E

25|$|Creatures such as Trolls, the Balrog, the Ents, the fell beasts, the Wargs, the mûmakil, and Shelob {{were created}} entirely within a computer. Creatures would spend months of {{creation}} and variation as sketches before approved designs were sculpted into five-foot maquettes <b>and</b> <b>scanned</b> into a computer. Animators would then rig skeletons and muscles before animation and final detailed colouring scanned from painted maquettes. Treebeard had a digital face composited upon the original animatronic, which was scanned for the digital model of his longshots.|$|E
25|$|The Eugene Manlove Rhodes Room, {{constructed}} {{as part of}} the 1987 expansion, holds the library's collection of Southwest books and materials. Within the room are a bank teller wall rescued from a bank in Vaughn, New Mexico and desks and other pieces of furniture from the early 1900s. In 1958 the Civic League purchased W. H. Hutchinson's collection of Eugene Manlove Rhodes materials and donated them to the library. The collection consists of books, correspondence, clippings, some magazines, and a few original manuscripts.

25|$|As Abosso {{settled in}} the water, she {{temporarily}} righted herself, her crew got her emergency generator working, and her floodlights were switched on to help the evacuation. Almost immediately after this, U-575 fired a torpedo {{from one of her}} stern torpedo tubes, which hit Abosso at 22:28 (Berlin time) forward of her bridge. At 2305 hrs (Berlin time) Abosso sank bow first. The submarine then surfaced, approached the débris area, <b>and</b> <b>scanned</b> the boats with her searchlights. Kptlt. Heydemann reported about 10 lifeboats and 15 to 20 liferafts afloat and occupied. Heydemann did not try to question survivors to identify the ship, and claimed in his report that this was because the weather was poor.|$|E

25|$|During {{restoration}} in 2002, {{the back}} of the cloth was photographed <b>and</b> <b>scanned</b> for the first time. Giulio Fanti, a scientist at the University of Padua, wrote an article on this subject with colleagues in 2005 that envisages electrostatic corona discharge as the probable mechanism to produce the images of the body in the Shroud. Congruent with that mechanism, they also describe an image on the reverse side of the fabric, much fainter than that on the front view of the body, consisting primarily of the face and perhaps hands. As with the front picture, it is entirely superficial, with coloration limited to the carbohydrate layer. The images correspond to, and are in registration with, those {{on the other side of}} the cloth. No image is detectable in the reverse side of the dorsal view of the body.|$|E
25|$|From 1929 to 1932, the BBC {{transmitters}} {{were used}} to broadcast television programmes using the 30-line Baird system, and from 1932 to 1935, the BBC also produced the programmes in their own studio at 16 Portland Place. On 3 November 1936, from Alexandra Palace located on the high ground of the north London ridge, the BBC began alternating Baird 240-line transmissions with EMI's electronic scanning system, which had recently been improved to 405 lines after a merger with Marconi. The Baird system at the time involved an intermediate film process, where footage was shot on cinefilm, which was rapidly developed <b>and</b> <b>scanned.</b> The trial was due to last 6 months but the BBC ceased broadcasts with the Baird system in February 1937, {{due in part to}} a disastrous fire in the Baird facilities at Crystal Palace. It was becoming apparent to the BBC that the Baird system would ultimately fail {{due in large part to}} the lack of mobility of the Baird system's cameras, with their developer tanks, hoses, and cables.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Balling {{process in}} {{selective}} laser sintering of 316 stainless steel powder was investigated. It showed that the balling phenomenon was ascribed to the higher liquid viscosity and surface tension effect during laser sintering. The effects of laser power <b>and</b> <b>scan</b> speed on the balling initiation was studied. It was found that increasing laser power <b>and</b> <b>scan</b> speed within a moderate range can reduce balling effect. However, care {{should be taken to}} control laser powers <b>and</b> <b>scan</b> speeds that can be used since their excessive increase may give rise to detrimental effects...|$|R

500|$|On {{the basis}} of microtomography scans of skull {{elements}} of the holotype specimen, Sereno's team created a [...] "prototype" [...] Nigersaurus skull they could examine. They also made an endocast of the brain <b>and</b> <b>scanned</b> the semicircular canals of its inner ear, which they found to be oriented horizontally. In their 2007 study, they stated that {{the structure of the}} occiput and cervical vertebrae would have limited the upward and downward movement of the neck and the rotation of the skull. Based on this biomechanical analysis, the team concluded that the head and muzzle were habitually oriented 67° downwards and close to ground level, as an adaptation for ground-level browsing. This is unlike the way other sauropods have been restored, with their heads held more horizontally.|$|E

500|$|Junos opening title sequence, {{depicting}} a rotoscoped Juno walking through her town while drinking {{a bottle of}} SunnyD orange drink, was put together over 7–8 months by a small design studio, Shadowplay Studio, based in Los Angeles. Reitman had met the studio's co-founder Gareth Smith in Japan on the short film festival circuit where they each had shorts screening. Shadowplay created the opening title sequence for Reitman's previous film, Thank You for Smoking, and he contacted them again {{when he found out}} he was going to direct Juno. With vintage 1970s punk-rock posters as inspiration, Smith and artist Jenny Lee decided to create a sequence that [...] "had texture {{and a little bit of}} edge, but also imparted the warmth and heart of the screenplay". In the last days of filming in Vancouver, Ellen Page was photographed with a high speed camera from a number of angles walking on a treadmill and drinking SunnyD. 900 still images of a walking and drinking Page were printed out and repeatedly run through a Xerox machine to degrade their quality until the pictures appeared hand-drawn. The pictures were cut-out <b>and</b> <b>scanned</b> back onto the computer then layered onto the background drawn by Lee with compositing software to create a stop motion animation sequence that corresponded to [...] "All I Want Is You" [...] by Barry Louis Polisar, the song Reitman had chosen. Shadowplay also designed the titlecards for each of the seasons for the film, hand-made a custom typeface for the opening title sequence and the closing credits, and collaborated on the design of the soundtrack and the DVD.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 56 - 60). Background: Information seeking <b>and</b> <b>scanning</b> describe active <b>and</b> routine {{exposure to}} health information and {{its association with}} health behavior. These concepts may also be related to population-level health disparities. Previous literature notes that access and use of health information differs across racial and socio-economic status (SES), which may contribute to disparities in health outcomes. Inconsistent use of contraception, which occurs at disparate rates along ethnic and SES lines, {{may be related to}} disparate rates of information seeking <b>and</b> <b>scanning.</b> Objective: In order to understand what contraception information young women use and its association with factors in the integrative model of behavioral prediction (IMBP), this thesis assessed the information seeking <b>and</b> <b>scanning</b> behaviors of young women. Rates of seeking <b>and</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>and</b> sources for information were compared across ethnic and SES groups. Method: Rates of information seeking <b>and</b> <b>scanning</b> as well as sources used were assessed through an online survey of 578 women aged 18 - 29. Participants??? knowledge, attitude, perceived norm, and perceived behavioral control (PBC), intention to use contraception, and contraception use behavior were measured. Demographic information such as ethnicity, age, relationship status, and SES was obtained. Results: There was a negative relationship between PBC and injunctive norms <b>and</b> <b>scanning</b> such that women who seek information more frequently had lower PBC. Rates of seeking <b>and</b> <b>scanning</b> were the same for all racial and SES groups. However, significant differences existed for the type interpersonal sources used to seek <b>and</b> <b>scan</b> across racial <b>and</b> SES lines. In addition, use of particular sources was related to consistent contraception use and intention to use contraception in the future. Discussion: Both interpersonal and mediated sources are associated with consistent use and intentions to use contraception in the future. Ethnic group and SES level are related to the sources used to seek <b>and</b> <b>scan.</b> Practitioners should target messages towards specific sources their audience depends on for information. Future theoretical work should look into the efficacy uses of information sources.
