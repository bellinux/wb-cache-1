40|$|Abstract. William Faulkner’s non-chronological {{story telling}} style {{has long been}} a {{challenge}} to critics and a puzzle to beginning literature students. “A <b>Rose</b> <b>for</b> <b>Emily,</b> ” one of Faulkner’s most frequently anthologized stories, exemplifies the complexity of Faulkner’s treatment of time. In this paper, we apply a constraint-based problem solving method to an analysis of the chronology of “A <b>Rose</b> <b>for</b> <b>Emily.</b> ” Constraint logic programming is a declarative programming language paradigm that solves problems by enforcing constraints among variables. CLP’s ability to sort numeric variables that do not yet have definite values makes it possible to sort the events of “A <b>Rose</b> <b>for</b> <b>Emily</b> ” with only fragmented and relative time information. In attempting to sort the events of the story, we find an inconsistency in the temporal references scattered throughout the narrative. After removing this inconsistency, we are able to compare our chronology with earlier ones and discuss the thematic relevance of Faulkner’s nonlinear plots...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{primarily}} concenrned with applying Genette’s narratological framework {{of time to}} the study of William Faulkner’s <b>A</b> <b>Rose</b> <b>for</b> <b>Emily.</b> This study aims to provide insights about the time shift processes in this short story. Moreover, since time is a component of narratology, this study will be concerned with discussions about ‘narratology’ and ‘narrative’, too. The study falls into two parts. The first section is allocated to the theoretical concepts of ‘narratology’, ‘narrative’, and ‘time’: ‘Narratology’ which is the study of narrative structures, includes many elements such as mood, voice, narration, as well as time (which is the focus of this study). ‘Narrative’ is the product of narration and it is what narratologists study and analyze. Furthermore, ‘time’-the main focus of this paper-will be elaborated on and then identified in <b>A</b> <b>Rose</b> <b>for</b> <b>Emily</b> based on Genette’s two fundamental dichotomies of ‘story time’ and ‘discourse time’. These theoretical discussions are taken into consideration while analysis of <b>A</b> <b>Rose</b> <b>for</b> <b>Emily.</b> The second section, will be devoted to the analysis of time using Genette’s model on Faulkner’s <b>A</b> <b>Rose</b> <b>for</b> <b>Emily.</b> For this aim, Genette’s concept of time which is classified into categories of order, duration, and frequency as well as their subcategories (which are already explained in the first section), will be identified and the shifts that have occurred will be determined.

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>Rose</b> <b>for</b> <b>Emily</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous short stories written by William Faulkner.

Yet <b>A</b> <b>Rose</b> <b>for</b> <b>Emily</b> is much more than just a morbid tale. It is reach in symbolic meanings and allows the reader to interpret Emily as a personification of the southern psyche, and the attitude of the citizens of Jefferson – as the attitude of southerners towards the South. Emily is both a personification and a victim of southern culture. Her necrophilia reveals one of the problems of southern culture – namely, its obsession with the past and the inability to acknowledge that the world has changed...|$|E

Wrapped in an endless past, disconnected and displaced, Emily lives in a vacuum, blind to the cultural values around. Primarily, the paper attempts to enlarge upon the notions of time and space in the aforementioned short story.

40|$|It is all {{too easy}} to dismiss myth as {{belonging}} to the realm of the abstract and theoretical, too removed from reality to constitute anything pragmatic. And yet myth makes up the very fabric of society, informing the way history is understood and the way people and things are remembered.

40|$|Applying a stylistic {{analysis}} on certain texts {{refers to the}} identification of patterns of usage in writing.  However, such an analysis is not restricted just to {{the description of the}} formal characteristics of texts, but it also tries to elucidate their functional importance for the interpretation of the text. This paper highlights complexity as a hallmark of a stylistic analysis in <b>A</b> <b>Rose</b> <b>for</b> <b>Emily,</b> a short story by William Faulkner (1897 - 1962). The analysis is done by adopting Halliday's (1985) approach to analyzing complexity in sentence structure; and Lauer, et al's (2008) approach to analyzing narrative from a macro perspective in relation to the story acts. The analysis rests upon the assumption that since form conveys meaning, Faulkner's multilayer usage of complexity is extremely functional. This paper tries also to detect and prove that stylistic complexity is manipulated to convey the main themes, events, and successfully leads to identify the distinctive structure of this story.   Keywords: Style, Stylistic Complexity, Hypotactic, Paratactic, Functiona...|$|E

Consequently, this paper concludes that the underlining reason for Emily&rsquo;s tragedy is her failure in social relations.

40|$|AbstractThis study aims {{to analyze}} the short story “A Rose for Emily” by William Faulkner and its Turkish {{translation}} placed in “Aşık Katiller Antolojisi” published by Everest Publishing from the stylistic perspective. This short story is a gothic story about the mysterious life of Miss Emily Grierson. It represents the numerous conflicts in the main character's life, illustrating the effect of social change on the individual. The analysis adopts an integrated approach of literature and language. For this study, a modified stylistic model developed by M. Short (1996) {{will be used for}} the linguistic analysis of Faulkner's style in <b>A</b> <b>Rose</b> <b>for</b> <b>Emily</b> to show how he affects the reader's understanding of the meaning: themes, structure, characters etc. Then, it will be examined whether the translation also affects the target-language readers in the same way or not.

It can be emphasized that the analysis can provide a better understanding of different narrative features in the text and its translation...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about how some {{linguistic}} theories {{can be helpful in}} understanding a literary work. Although a literary criticism is still called for, the theories are able to make the literary work be easier to comprehend. The narrative order of <b>A</b> <b>Rose</b> <b>for</b> <b>Emily</b> - a short story written by William Faulkner is hard to follow since it is not in time sequence. The writer of this thesis intends to arrange them chronologically, but first, she would like to find out the " topics " of the literary work. Using a discourse analysis theory, in this case the notion of discourse topics, the content of short story is represented into propositions. Being treated as a discourse or language in use, aspects of context of the short story must be considered. Thus, besides identifying the propositions, the activated feature of context, in this case the time aspect should also be determined. Based on the context, the writer divides the propositions into fragments and searches for the most important part or the discourse topic within each fragment. By finding out the correct topics and providing them with the setting of the time when each event happens, it is possible for the writer to arrange the events based on a common narrative order...|$|E

40|$|Esta dissertação focaliza dois textos do escritor William Faulkner, considerado pela crítica como um dos expoentes das experimentações modernistas. O primeiro a ser estudado aqui é <b>A</b> <b>Rose</b> <b>for</b> <b>Emily,</b> uma {{short story}} publicada em 1930; o segundo é Absalom, Absalom!, um romance de 1936. O objetivo é {{investigar}} se no trabalho de Faulkner pode ser encontrado um narrador por excelência, partindo do conceito apresentado por Walter Benjamin em seu estudo The storyteller: {{reflections on the}} works of Nikolai Leskov. Minha proposta é levantar a questão do fim da comunicabilidade da experiência do narrador para então sugerir que, ao contrário do que Benjamin afirma, a arte de narrar não chegou ao fim. Meu argumento é de que as narrativas de Faulkner evidenciam sua arte de narrar imbricada com seu uso de ponto de vista. A experiência e a experimentação de Faulkner enquanto escritor são investigadas neste trabalho, principalmente sua manipulação do uso de ponto de vista, e são analisadas à luz de conceitos desenvolvidos por Walter Benjamin, Wayne Booth, Gérard Genette, Mieke Bal, entre outros. Os resultados desta pesquisa destacam que o trabalho de Faulkner com ponto de vista pode ser considerado muito mais que um mero experimento modernista, pois sua experiência como escritor proveniente do Sul dos Estados Unidos tem impacto nessa experimentação. A memória individual e coletiva, a transmissão de experiência, o contar e o recontar de histórias dos narradores, são fatores importantes para a construção de significado nas narrativas estudadas. Além disso, ao discutir a significação de sua obra, tanto no aspecto formal quanto no aspecto relativo ao contexto geográfico e literário de seu tempo e lugar, espero contribuir com mais um olhar sobre as estratégias narrativas de Faulkner, escritor que, ainda hoje, fomenta investigação e produção acadêmica significativa, justamente por conseguir construir círculos narrativos que apresentam narradores por excelência. This thesis brings into focus two texts by William Faulkner, a writer who has been praised {{as one of the}} exponents at modernist experimentations. The first one to be studied here is <b>A</b> <b>Rose</b> <b>for</b> <b>Emily,</b> a short story published in 1930; the second is Absalom, Absalom!, a novel from 1936. The objective is to investigate whether a genuine storyteller can be found in Faulkner‘s work, supported by the concept presented by Walter Benjamin in his essay The storyteller: reflections on the works of Nikolai Leskov. My aim is to raise the question of the end of communicability of experience in order to suggest that, contrary to what Benjamin affirms, the art of storytelling has not reached its end. My argument is that Faulkner‘s narratives evidence his storytelling art as being imbricated with his use of point of view. Faulkner‘s experience and experimentation as a writer are investigated here, principally his manipulation with the use of point of view, and they are analyzed {{in the light of the}} concepts developed by Walter Benjamin, Wayne Booth, Gérard Genette, Mieke Bal, and others. The results of this research highlight that Faulkner‘s work with point of view is to be considered much more than merely a modernist experimentation, because his experience as a writer from the South of the United States has impact on this experimentation. Individual and collective memory, transmission of experience, narrators telling and retelling stories, are important factors for the construction of meaning in the narratives studied here. Moreover, by discussing the meaningfulness of his work, whether in its formal aspect or in the aspect related to the geographic and literary context of its time and place, I expect to contribute with yet another look into the narrative strategies employed by Faulkner, a writer that, still today, fosters academic investigation and production, exactly for being able to construct telling circles that present genuine storytellers...|$|E
