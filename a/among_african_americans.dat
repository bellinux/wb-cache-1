In 1927 the first Urban League chapter (now the Urban League of Nebraska) in the American West was founded in the city. Whitney Young led the chapter in 1950, tripling its membership. Eventually, he would take over the national leadership of the Urban League in 1961.|$|E

5|$|The new law was {{met with}} {{considerable}} resistance, especially in the towns and cities, where Tillman had less support. Dozens of clandestine saloons opened, fueled by barrels of illicit liquor, often transported by railroad. Tillman appointed dispensary constables, who tried to seize such shipments, to be frustrated {{by the fact that}} the South Carolina Railroad was in federal receivership, and state authorities could not confiscate goods entrusted to it. All of Tillman's constables were white, placing him at a disadvantage in dealing with the alcohol trade <b>among</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans.</b> Some of the constables tried going undercover by blacking their faces like minstrels; later, Tillman hired an African-American detective from Georgia.|$|E

California State University, Los Angeles, 2013 Committee members: Anh-Luu Huynh-Hohnbaum, Valentine M Villa, Dale WeaverAfrican, American, Religion, Spirituality, Suicide, YouthSuicide {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of death <b>among</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> youth, and suicide {{ideation}} is linked with many negative indicators of mental health and symptoms of depression, which impact the quality and enjoyment of one's life. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between religiosity and suicidality <b>among</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> youth. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health, WAVE III), higher levels of religiosity were hypothesized to provide protection against suicide ideation <b>among</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> youth. The findings did not provide evidence for any significant relationship between religiosity and suicidality <b>among</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> youth. However, general, intrinsic and extrinsic measures of religiosity were found to be significantly correlated to one another. Findings from this study have implications for practice and policy. For example, suicide risk assessment may need to include more comprehensive indirect measures to assess suicidality <b>among</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> youth...|$|R
40|$|This Study {{examined}} {{issues related}} to persistence in higher education <b>among</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> students, using the prominent model proposed by Vincent Tinto.

The study examines factors from the Tinto model such as high school GPA, College GPA, college social integration and academic integration to try and explain the effects of gender <b>among</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> students. This research also attempts to elaborate the Tinto model by considering high school extracurricular activities as a pre-entry attribute that {{has an effect on}} persistence in higher education.

5|$|McLeod {{attended}} Mayesville's one-room black schoolhouse, Trinity Mission School, {{which was}} run by the Presbyterian Board of Missions of Freedmen. She was the only child in her family to attend school, so each day, she taught her family what she had learned. To get to and from school, Mary walked five miles each day. Her teacher Emma Jane Wilson became a significant mentor in her life. Wilson had attended Scotia Seminary (now Barber-Scotia College). She helped McLeod attend the same school on a scholarship, which she did from 1888–1893. The following year, she attended Dwight L. Moody's Institute for Home and Foreign Missions in Chicago (now the Moody Bible Institute), hoping to become a missionary in Africa. Told that black missionaries were not needed, she planned to teach, as education was a prime goal <b>among</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{co-operation}} in the AFL-CIO merger, Meany and Reuther had {{a contentious}} relationship for many years. In 1963, Meany and Reuther disagreed about the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, {{a major event}} {{in the history of}} the civil rights movement in the United States. Meany opposed AFL-CIO endorsement of the march. In an AFL-CIO executive council meeting on August 12, Reuther's motion for a strong endorsement of the march was supported by only A. Philip Randolph of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the titular leader of the march. The AFL-CIO endorsed a civil rights law and allowed individual unions to endorse the march. When Meany heard Randolph's speech after the march, he was visibly moved. Thereafter, he supported the creation of the A. Philip Randolph Institute to strengthen labor unions <b>among</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> and to strengthen ties with the African American community. Randolph said that he was sure that Meany was morally opposed to racism.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{majority}} of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> {{college students in}} the U. S. attend predominantly white institutions (PWIs). However, there is minimal research examining this population’s HIV/STI risk behaviors. The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to assess HIV/STI behavioral risk factors <b>among</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> college students (aged 18 – 24 years) attending PWIs. (n = 2, 568) Methods: Backwards step-wise logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine factors associated with a positive HIV/STI diagnosis (past year) <b>among</b> sexually active <b>African</b> <b>American</b> college students who participated in the Spring, 2006 National College Health Assessment. Findings: Nine factors were significantly associated with an HIV/STI diagnosis <b>among</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> college students attending PWIs.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to better {{understand}} factors contributing to relationship satisfaction <b>among</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> heterosexual couples, this study explored the impact of communication behavior and partner acceptance on relationship satisfaction <b>among</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> heterosexual couples. Additionally, the moderating role of ethnic identity on <b>African</b> <b>American</b> relationship processes and couple satisfaction was also explored. Results indicated that communication behaviors and partner acceptance {{were significantly related to}} relationship satisfaction <b>among</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> couples. Additionally, crossover effects were found such that the communication behaviors and partner acceptance of one partner significantly impacted the relationship satisfaction of their spouse. However, these results varied by gender. Finally, analyses exploring the moderation effect of ethnic identity found that female ethnic identity moderated the relationship between female acceptance of partner positive behavior and male relationship satisfaction. Research and clinical implications of these findings for <b>African</b> <b>American</b> heterosexual relationships are discussed...|$|R

25|$|In the United States, with no endemic malaria, the {{prevalence}} of sickle-cell anaemia <b>among</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> is lower (about 0.25%) than in West Africa (about 4.0%) and is falling. Without endemic malaria, the sickle-cell mutation is purely disadvantageous and tends to decline in the affected population by natural selection, and now artificially through prenatal genetic screening. However, the African American community descends from a significant admixture of several African and non-African ethnic groups and also represents the descendants of survivors of slavery and the slave trade. Thus, a lower degree of endogamy and, particularly, abnormally high health-selective pressure through slavery {{may be the most}} plausible explanations for the lower prevalence of sickle-cell anaemia (and, possibly, other genetic diseases) <b>among</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> compared to West Africans. Another factor that limits the spread of sickle-cell genes in North America is the absence of cultural proclivities to polygamy, which allows affected males to continue to seek unaffected children with multiple partners.|$|E
