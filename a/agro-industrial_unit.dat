40|$|Coelaenomenodera lameensis is {{the major}} pest of the oil palm. There are several methods {{currently}} employed {{in the fight against}} this pest including insecticide spraying on the palm leaflets. Investigations were carried out at the <b>agro-industrial</b> <b>unit</b> of Toumanguie located in the southeastern region of Côte d’Ivoire. Aqueous extracts of leaves of Thevetia peruviana, Ocimum gratissimum and Ricinus communis, rhizome of Zingiber officinale, seed capsule of R. communis and seed of Azadirachta indica were applied in various concentrations to C. lameensis. Leaflets covered with sleeves of muslin were used as substrate for laying and breeding of C. lameensis. Extracts were pulverized and applied to leaflets lodging eggs, larvae and adults of C. lameensis. The ovicidal effect was observed with azadirachtin on eggs aged 1 and 4 days at the concentration of 1. 66. 10 - 3 g /ml. The biggest rises in percentages of efficiency were achieved on larvae, at 69. 36 % (stage 1) and 61. 86 % (stage 2) with the same concentrations of azadirachtin. The percentages of efficiency on larvae at stages 3 and 4 for all concentrations of aqueous extracts combined were less than 5 %. The higher mortality rates were achieved 24 hours after treatment. These rates were induced by the extract of R. communis seed capsule at the concentration of 0. 8 g/ml. The aqueous extract of the A. indica seed and of the R. communis seed capsule could be used for integrated pest management against C. lameensis by reducing numbers of its eggs, young larvae and adults...|$|E
40|$|Coelaenomenodera lameensis is {{the major}} pest of oil palm. The fight against this pest is {{achieved}} by using several methods including the injection of systemic insecticide {{in the trunk of}} the palm. The tests were conducted at the <b>agro-industrial</b> <b>units</b> of Toumanguié, located 90 km from Abidjan. Azadirachtin A was used in systemic treatment at four concentrations: 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 4 and 0. 6 g/ml. Chiffon sleeves were placed on the palms to assess the effect of products on C. lameensis. Systemic injections were made during the dry and rainy seasons. The efficacy of azadirachtin was assessed by reference to thiamethoxam, an insecticide used in the fight against this pest. The effective minimal concentration was 0. 4 g/ml of azadirachtin. This concentration generated the cumulated mortality rates of 38. 92 % in dry season and 19. 28 % in rainy season on the adults after 28 days of treatment. The percentages of efficiency achieved in the dry season on the larvae 7 days after treatment were 74. 75 % (stage 1), 57. 23 % (stage 2), 7. 14 % (stage 3) and 5. 31 % (stage 4). In rainy season, the efficacy of azadirachtin on larvae was less than 29 %. Azadirachtin can be used in dry season, {{at the beginning of the}} infestation period, to fight against C. lameensis.

40|$|The article {{examines}} the scientific and methodological apparatus assessment, built {{on the basis of}} the categories of «effectiveness» and «optimality», will allow, on the one hand, to establish the efficiency of functioning of associations in prior periods, on the other - to identify the parameters conditioning condition and results of integrated production in the future. Taking into account the results of these studies, we developed a methodology of integrated assessment of efficiency of functioning of the <b>agro-industrial</b> <b>units.</b> Its essence consists in the determination of the integral coefficient of efficiency on the basis of two complementary groups of settings: performance, expressed in the system of relative indicators, and optimality, the quantitative characteristics of which used the limit values. As the distinctive features of the proposed methodology, determining its scientific novelty and practical significance, it should be noted: enabling the assessment of the effectiveness in using existing and advanced involved in production resources; the use of a unified system of criteria and performance measures and to determine the level of optimality of meat production, built in accordance with the sequence of stages of the reproduction process; universality settlement mechanism, used for the analysis of efficiency of managing the links of the production chain (agriculture, processing, trade) and overall integration. The technique involves the execution of the aggregate calculation and analytical operations, grouped by us in the framework of interrelated stages. The result can be identified priority directions of development of the Association, the necessity to optimize the composition of participants and proportions of the process chain, development and implementation of innovative programs, development of new technologies and management methods...|$|R
40|$|Caracterizou-se o modelo de agroindustrializaÃÃo de pequeno porte do municÃpio de Guarapuava-PR, ao ser evidenciada a inserÃÃo da propriedade rural {{familiar}} e ressaltados os aspectos de sobrevivÃncia no mercado como fator de sustentabilidade. Considerou-se o levantamento das agroindÃstrias dos sistemas alimentar e nÃo alimentar que compÃem o setor econÃmico secundÃrio, bem como o perfil da pequena propriedade rural familiar, de 1 a 50 hectares, integrada ao cooperativismo. Para tanto, utilizou-se uma amostra de 218 estabelecimentos vinculados Ã Cooperativa de Micros e Pequenos Produtores de Guarapuava, com nÃvel de confiabilidade estatÃstica de 95 % e erro de 5 %. TambÃm, considerou-se a inserÃÃo das unidades agroindustriais do Programa FÃbrica do Agricultor. No cenÃrio do setor secundÃrio, 70, 83 % das unidades empresariais pertencem ao sistema agroindustrial nÃo alimentar e 29, 17 % ao sistema agroalimentar, sendo que 26, 18 % das unidades tÃm sua atividade produtiva voltada para agroindustrializaÃÃo. A matÃria-prima oriunda da floresta Ã utilizada em 64, 59 % das agroindÃstrias e da agropecuÃria em 35, 14 %. Das propriedades rurais familiares investigadas, 26, 60 % apresentaram algum tipo agroindustrializaÃÃo formal ou artesanal. Quanto Ã inserÃÃo ao Programa FÃbrica do Agricultor, no perÃodo de 1999 a 2004, levantou-se um total de 38 unidades, sendo 2, 63 % em processo de implantaÃÃo e adaptaÃÃo, 7, 89 % em estudo de viabilidade econÃmica, 7, 89 % inativas, 10, 53 % fechadas e 71, 05 % em operaÃÃo. Os resultados remetem ao grande desafio que Ã a inserÃÃo do pequeno estabelecimento rural familiar no processo de agroindustrializaÃÃo sustentado, essencialmente quanto ao aspecto econÃmico-financeiro. As principais dificuldades referem-se Ã tecnologia, capacitaÃÃo, competitividade, gestÃo estratÃgica, qualidade e seguranÃa dos produtos e, principalmente Ã comercializaÃÃo. As empresas agroalimentares, isoladamente, nÃo exemplificam resultados lucrativos. O desenvolvimento da agroindustrializaÃÃo de pequeno porte, voltado Ã propriedade rural familiar, estÃ condicionado ao modelo de alianÃas estratÃgias formatadas por meio de parcerias as quais configuram o modelo sistÃmico, alÃm da necessidade de se trabalhar com produtos diferenciados em contraponto Ã ausÃncia da escala de produÃÃo. This trial aimed on featuring small agro-industrialization from Guarapuava-PR, when familiar rural farms were inserted and highlighted some survival aspects at {{the market}} as a sustainable factor. It was {{taking into account the}} agroindustries survey, regarding feeding and non-feeding systems, which are part of secondary economical branch, as well as the small (1 to 50 hectares), rural and familiar farm profile, also integrated to cooperativeness. As a consequence, it was used a sample of 218 farms linked to Cooperative of Micro and Small Producers from Guarapuava and a confidential statistical level of 95 % so, there was a 5 % of error. The insertion of <b>agro-industrial</b> <b>units</b> from The Program Farmer Factory was also considered. At the secondary sector, there are 70. 83 % of enterprising units that belong to the non-feeding agro-industrial system and 29. 17 % are from agro-feeding system, but 26. 18 % of them have there production guided to agro-industrialization. The forest raw material is used in 64. 59 % of agro-industries while 35. 14 % of farming industries use it. Observing the familiar rural farms studied, it was possible to record that 26. 60 % of them applied some king of agro-industrialization, formal or rudimental. Regarding, the Program Farmer Factory from 1999 to 2004, it was recorded 38 units, of them 2. 63 % in implantation and adjustment; 7. 89 % in studied of economical viability; 7. 89 % inactive; 10. 53 % definitely closed and 71. 05 % in activity. These results drive through a great challenge, which is the insertion of small familiar rural farm at the sustained agro-industrialization process, mainly because of the economical-financial aspect. The biggest difficulties were the absence technology; technical ability; competitiveness; strategic administration; quality and safety of products, but the most important was trading. Agro-industries enterprises by themselves do not show profitable results. The agricultureindustrialization development of small size, concerning the family rural farm, depends on the pattern set up by of formatted and strategic alliances through partnerships revealing a systemic pattern, as well as the necessity of working with several products due to the absence of scale production...|$|R
