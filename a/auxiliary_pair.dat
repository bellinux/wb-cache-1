40|$|This paper extends a {{previous}} claim that auxiliary selection {{in the present}} perfect of monadic verbs reflects a pattern grounded in lexico-aspectual properties of individual verbs though mediated through their syntax. A novel argument {{in support of this}} conclusion is made, based on the cross-contextual typology of auxiliaries, showing that the cross-linguistic distribution of auxiliaries in the present perfect cannot be understood in isolation of other constructions requiring an auxiliary. In particular, it is argued that two sets of constraints restrict the mapping from lexico-aspectual features to a particular auxiliary (have or be). One set restricts the mapping from lexical-aspectual features to argument structure at the lexicon-syntax interface, the other restricts the mapping from argument structure to the marked member of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>pair</b> (have). The analysis succeeds in predicting exactly 15 possible languages or patterns of auxiliary selection with monadic verbs, a variety of which are discussed throughout the paper. While the fundamental syntactic distinction made by the Unaccusative Hypothesis is confirmed by the formal analysis, it is argued that the present perfect imposes restrictions of its own on the argumental status of any verb entering the construction, on a par with constructions such as passives and resultatives...|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} has been developed for extracting approximate quantum state-to-state information from classical trajectory simulations which "quantizes" symmetrically both the initial and final classical actions associated with the degrees of freedom of interest using quantum number bins (or "window functions") which are significantly narrower than unit-width. This approach thus imposes a more stringent quantization condition on classical trajectory simulations than has been traditionally employed, while doing so {{in a manner that}} is time-symmetric and microscopically reversible. To demonstrate this "symmetric quasi-classical" (SQC) approach for a simple real system, collinear H + H 2 reactive scattering calculations were performed [S. J. Cotton and W. H. Miller, J. Phys. Chem. A 117, 7190 (2013) ] with SQC-quantization applied to the H 2 vibrational degree of freedom (DOF). It was seen that the use of window functions of approximately 1 / 2 -unit width led to calculated reaction probabilities in very good agreement with quantum mechanical results over the threshold energy region, representing a significant improvement over what is obtained using the traditional quasi-classical procedure. The SQC approach was then applied [S. J. Cotton and W. H. Miller, J. Chem. Phys. 139, 234112 (2013) ] to the much more interesting and challenging problem of incorporating non-adiabatic effects into what would otherwise be standard classical trajectory simulations. To do this, the classical Meyer-Miller (MM) Hamiltonian was used to model the electronic DOFs, with SQC-quantization applied to the classical "electronic" actions of the MM model [...] representing the occupations of the electronic states [...] in order to extract the electronic state population dynamics. It was demonstrated that if one ties the zero-point energy (ZPE) of the electronic DOFs to the SQC windowing function's width parameter this very simple SQC/MM approach is capable of quantitatively reproducing quantum mechanical results for a range of standard benchmark models of electronically non-adiabatic processes, including applications where "quantum" coherence effects are significant. Notably, among these benchmarks was the well-studied "spin-boson" model of condensed phase non-adiabatic dynamics, in both its symmetric and asymmetric forms [...] the latter of which many classical approaches fail to treat successfully. The SQC/MM approach to the treatment of non-adiabatic dynamics was next applied [S. J. Cotton, K. Igumenshchev, and W. H. Miller, J. Chem. Phys., 141, 084104 (2014) ] to several recently proposed models of condensed phase electron transfer (ET) processes. For these problems, a flux-side correlation function framework modified for consistency with the SQC approach was developed for the calculation of thermal ET rate constants, and excellent accuracy was seen over wide ranges of non-adiabatic coupling strength and energetic bias/exothermicity. Significantly, the "inverted regime" in thermal rate constants (with increasing bias) known from Marcus Theory was reproduced quantitatively for these models [...] representing the successful treatment of another regime that classical approaches generally have difficulty in correctly describing. Relatedly, a model of photoinduced proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) was also addressed, and it was shown that the SQC/MM approach could reasonably model the explicit population dynamics of the photoexcited electron donor and acceptor states over the four parameter regimes considered. The potential utility of the SQC/MM technique lies in its stunning simplicity and the ease by which it may readily be incorporated into "ordinary" molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In short, a typical MD simulation may be augmented to take non-adiabatic effects into account simply by introducing an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>pair</b> of classical "electronic" action-angle variables for each energetically viable Born-Oppenheimer surface, and time-evolving these auxiliary variables via Hamilton's equations (using the MM electronic Hamiltonian) in the same manner that the other classical variables [...] i. e., the coordinates of all the nuclei [...] are evolved forward in time. In a complex molecular system involving many hundreds or thousands of nuclear DOFs, the propagation of these extra "electronic" variables represents a modest increase in computational effort, and yet, the examples presented herein suggest that in many instances the SQC/MM approach will describe the true non-adiabatic quantum dynamics to a reasonable and useful degree of quantitative accuracy...|$|E

In this paper, we discuss the difficulty of pairing inversion on the generalized ate pairings of Vercauteren.

We provide a suf-ficient condition on the integer vector, in terms of its max norm, so that the corresponding auxiliary paring is non-degenerate. Finally, we define an infinite set of curve parameters, which includes those of typical pair-ing friendly curves, and we show that, within those parameters, PI of arbitrarily given generalized ate pairing can be reduced to modified EI in polynomial time...|$|R

40|$|Channel {{estimation}} is {{of critical}} importance in millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Due {{to the use of}} large antenna arrays, low-complexity mmWave specific channel estimation algorithms are required. In this paper, an <b>auxiliary</b> beam <b>pair</b> design is proposed to provide high-resolution estimates of the channel's angle-of-departure (AoD) and angle-of-arrival (AoA) for mmWave MIMO systems. By performing an amplitude comparison with respect to each <b>auxiliary</b> beam <b>pair,</b> a set of ratio measures that characterize the channel's AoD and AoA are obtained by the receiver. Either the best ratio measure or the estimated AoD is quantized and fed back to the transmitter via a feedback channel. The proposed technique can be incorporated into control channel design to minimize initial access delay. Though the design principles are derived assuming a high-power regime, evaluation under more realistic assumption shows that by employing the proposed method, good angle estimation performance is achieved under various signal-to-noise ratio levels and channel conditions.

40|$|The {{security}} of pairing-based cryptosystems {{is closely related}} to the difficulty of the pairing inversion problem. Building on previous works, we provide further contributions on the difficulty of pairing inversion. In particular, we revisit the approach of Kanayama-Okamoto who modified exponentiation inversion and Miller inversion by considering an âauxiliary â pairing. First, by generalizing and simplifying Kanayama-Okamotoâs approach, we provide a simpler approach for inverting generalized ate pairings of Vercauteren. Then we provide a complexity of the modified Miller inversion, showing that the complexity depends on the sum-norm of the integer vector defining the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>pairing.</b> Next, we observe that the auxiliary pairings (choice of integer vectors) suggested by Kanayama-Okamoto are degenerate and thus the modified exponentiation inversion is expected to be harder than the original exponentiation inversion. We provide a sufficient condition on the integer vector, in terms of its max norm, so that the corresponding auxiliary paring is non-degenerate. Finally, we define an infinite set of curve parameters, which includes those of typical pairing friendly curves, and we show that, within those parameters, pairing inversion of arbitrarily given generalized ate pairing can be reduced to exponentiation inversion in polynomial time...|$|R
40|$|We study s-wave {{superconductivity}} in the {{two dimensional}} attractive Hubbard model in an applied magnetic field, assume the extreme Pauli limit, and examine the role of spatial fluctuations in the coupling regime corresponding to BCS-BEC crossover. We use a decomposition of the interaction {{in terms of an}} <b>auxiliary</b> <b>pairing</b> field, retain the static mode, and sample the pairing field via Monte Carlo. The method requires iterative solution of the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BdG) equations for amplitude and phase fluctuating configurations of the pairing field. We establish the full thermal phase diagram of this strong coupling problem, revealing $T_c$ scales an order of magnitude below the mean field estimate, highlight the spontaneous inhomogeneity in the field induced magnetization, and discover a strong non monotonicity in the temperature dependence of the low energy density of states. We compare our results to the experimental phase diagram of the imbalanced Fermi gas at unitarity.

40|$|We {{compare the}} {{standard}} 50 %-efficient single beam splitter method for Bell-state measurement to a proposed 75 %-efficient auxiliary-photon-enhanced scheme [W. P. Grice, Phys. Rev. A 84, 042331 (2011) ] {{in light of}} realistic conditions. The two schemes are compared with consideration for high input state photon loss, auxiliary state photon loss, detector inefficiency and coupling loss, detector dark counts, and non-number-resolving detectors. We also analyze the two schemes when multiplexed arrays of non-number-resolving detectors are used. Furthermore, we explore the possibility of utilizing spontaneous parametric down-conversion as the <b>auxiliary</b> photon <b>pair</b> source required by the enhanced scheme. In these different cases, we determine the bounds on the detector parameters at which the enhanced scheme becomes superior to the standard scheme and describe {{the impact of the}} different imperfections on measurement success rate and discrimination fidelity. This is done using a combination of numeric and analytic techniques. For many of the cases discussed, the size of the Hilbert space and the number of measurement outcomes can be very large, which makes direct numerical solutions computationally costly. To alleviate this problem, all of our numerical computations are performed using pure states. This requires tracking the loss modes until measurement and treating dark counts as variations on measurement outcomes rather than modifications to the state itself. In addition, we provide approximate analytic expressions that illustrate the effect of different imperfections on the Bell-state analyzer quality.

Our {{goal is to}} allocate a set of tunnels that minimize the blocking probability for the dynamic traffic that will follow the prior-known historical traffic matrix. A heuristic Capacity-Balanced Static Tunnel Allocation (CB-STA) has been proposed [1], which always tries to allocate a tunnel from the node with maximal predicted traffic {{going out to the}} node with maximal predicted traffic coming in. However, the tunnel length constraint is not carefully considered while selecting node pairs. Thus, this work proposes a heuristic, Weighted Tunnel Allocation (WTA), to improve CB-STA. WTA adds some additional edges with predefined hop length, termed auxiliary links, to the original topology to form an <b>auxiliary</b> graph. Node <b>pair</b> incident to an auxiliary link means that there could be tunnels allocated for it.
