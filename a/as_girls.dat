5|$|Nick Stuart (April 10, 1904 - April 7, 1973) was an Austro-Hungarian-born American {{actor and}} bandleader. His career spanned five decades, {{during which he}} {{appeared}} in over 50 films, {{more than half of}} them features, as well as film shorts, serials, and even one television appearance. He rose to stardom in such films <b>as</b> <b>Girls</b> Gone Wild and Chasing Through Europe, prior to expanding his business interests by creating a talent agency, and a popular upscale club in Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|The game {{continues}} Mother {{story in}} that Giygas reappears as the antagonist (and thus {{did not die}} {{at the end of}} Mother) and the player has the option of choosing whether to continue the protagonist's story by choosing whether to name their player-character the same as the original. He considered interstellar and interplanetary space travel instead of the confines of a single planet in the new game. After four months, Itoi scrapped the idea as cliché. Itoi sought to make a game that would appeal to populations that were playing games less, such <b>as</b> <b>girls.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rotavirus A, which {{accounts}} for more than 90% of rotavirus gastroenteritis in humans, is endemic worldwide. Each year rotavirus causes millions of cases of diarrhoea in developing countries, almost 2million of which result in hospitalisation. In 2013, an estimated 215,000 children younger than five died from rotavirus, 90 percent of whom were in developing countries. Almost every child has been infected with rotavirus by age five. Rotavirus is the leading single cause of severe diarrhoea among infants and children, is responsible for {{about a third of the}} cases requiring hospitalisation, and causes 37% of deaths attributable to diarrhoea and 5% of all deaths in children younger than five. Boys are twice as likely <b>as</b> <b>girls</b> to be admitted to hospital for rotavirus.|$|E

25|$|Most XY {{children}} are so undervirilized {{that they are}} raised <b>as</b> <b>girls.</b> The testes are uniformly nonfunctional and undescended; they are removed when the diagnosis is made due {{to the risk of}} cancer development in these tissues.|$|E
25|$|Individuals with 5-ARD {{are born}} with male gonads, {{including}} testicles and Wolffian structures. They can have normal male external genitalia, ambiguous genitalia, or normal female genitalia, but usually tend towards a female appearance. As a consequence, they are often raised <b>as</b> <b>girls,</b> but usually have a male gender identity.|$|E
25|$|Within Sandbach {{there is}} also a girls {{comprehensive}} school, Sandbach High.

It now has a college attached to it, which accepts boys as well <b>as</b> <b>girls</b> and offers a more vocational side of education along with A levels.|$|E

25|$|Traditional Odissi {{exists in}} two major styles, the first perfected {{by women and}} {{focussed}} on solemn, spiritual temple dance (maharis); the second perfected by boys dressed <b>as</b> <b>girls</b> (gotipuas) which diversified to include athletic and acrobatic moves, and were performed from festive occasions in temples to general folksy entertainment. Modern Odissi productions by Indian artists have presented a diverse range of experimental ideas, culture fusion, themes and plays.|$|E
25|$|We learn <b>as</b> <b>girls</b> that in ways both {{subtle and}} obvious, {{personal}} and political, our value as females is largely determined by how we look. … For black women, {{the domination of}} physical aspects of beauty in women's definition and value render us invisible, partially erased, or obsessed, sometimes for a lifetime, since most of us lack the major talismans of Western beauty. Black women find themselves involved in a lifelong effort to self-define {{in a culture that}} provides them no positive reflection.|$|E
25|$|Transient {{synovitis}} usually affects {{children between}} three and ten years old (but {{it has been reported}} in a 3-month-old infant and in some adults).

A recent viral infection (most commonly an upper respiratory tract infection) or a trauma have been postulated as precipitating events, although these are reported only in 30% and 5% of cases, respectively.|$|E

25|$|There are no {{difficulties}} assigning appropriate sex {{for most}} infants with CAH. Genetic males have normal male genitalia and gonads and simply need hormone replacement. Most virilized females are assigned and raised <b>as</b> <b>girls</b> {{even if their}} genitalia are ambiguous or look more male than female. They have normal ovaries and uterus and potential fertility with hormone replacement and surgery. However, the dilemmas surrounding sex assignment of the most severely virilized XX infants have helped shape our understanding of gender identity and sexual orientation, {{and continue to be}} a subject of debate.|$|E
25|$|Upon its release, Tangled Up {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics, who commended the dance-oriented sound, songwriting and fun production. However, minor criticism was aimed towards certain inclusions on the record. Despite this, Tangled Up {{has been identified}} by numerous commentators <b>as</b> <b>Girls</b> Aloud and Xenomania's best work. Commercially, it experienced success in the United Kingdom, peaking at number four, and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments of 300,000 units. It performed moderately in Ireland, reaching number 25, and was certified gold by the Irish Recorded Music Association (IRMA) for 7,500 claimed sales.|$|E
25|$|In the United States alone—before {{initiation}} of the rotavirus vaccination programme—over 2.7million cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis occurred annually, 60,000 children were hospitalised and around 37 {{died from the}} results of the infection. The major role of rotavirus in causing diarrhoea is not widely recognised within the public health community, particularly in developing countries. Almost every child has been infected with rotavirus by age five. It is the leading single cause of severe diarrhoea among infants and children, being responsible for about 20% of cases, and accounts for 50% of the cases requiring hospitalisation.

25|$|Genetic males (46,XY) with 5α-reductase type II {{deficiency}} {{are born}} with undervirilization including pseudohermaphroditism (ambiguous genitalia), pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias, and usually undescended testes. Their external genitalia are female-like, with micropenis (a small, clitoris-like phallus), a partially unfused, labia-like scrotum, and a blind-ending, shallow vaginal pouch. Due to their lack of conspicuous male genitalia, genetic males with the condition are typically raised <b>as</b> <b>girls.</b> At the time of puberty however, they develop striking phenotypically masculine secondary sexual characteristics including partial virilization of the genitals (enlargement of the phallus into a near-functional penis and descent of the testes), voice deepening, typical male musculoskeletal development, and no menstruation, breast development, or other signs of feminization that occur during female puberty. In addition, normal libido and spontaneous erections develop, they usually show a sexual preference for females, and almost all develop a male gender identity.|$|E
25|$|The {{lifetime}} prevalence, or {{the proportion}} of individuals expected to stutter at one time in their lives, is about 5%, and overall males are affected two to five times more often than females. However, {{there is not much}} information known about the underlying cause for such a skewed sex ratio. Most stuttering begins in early childhood, and studies suggest that 2.5% of {{children under the age of}} 5 stutter. As seen in children who have just begun stuttering, there is an equivalent number of boys and girls who stutter. Still, the sex ratio appears to widen as children grow: among preschoolers, boys who stutter outnumber girls who stutter by about a two to one ratio, or less. This ratio widens to three to one during first grade, and five to one during fifth grade, <b>as</b> <b>girls</b> have higher recovery rates. Due to high (approximately 65–75%) rates of early recovery, the overall prevalence of stuttering is generally considered to be approximately 1%.|$|E
25|$|HBO's {{programming}} schedule currently consists {{largely of}} theatrically released feature films – which occupy {{the majority of}} its daily schedule – and original series primarily aimed at adults (including, , dramas such as Game of Thrones and Westworld, and comedies such <b>as</b> <b>Girls,</b> Veep, Ballers, Last Week Tonight and Silicon Valley). In addition, HBO also carries original made-for-TV movies, sports events and sports-centric documentary and magazine series, documentary films, behind-the-scenes specials, and concert and stand-up comedy specials. The network primarily airs most of its original programs on its main channel after 8:00p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time, although it airs select original series and made-for-cable movies as well as certain documentaries during the daytime hours; these programs also air at various times on HBO's multiplex channels. HBO Signature, HBO Family, HBO Comedy and HBO Zone also each carry archived HBO programming, airing repeats of former original series and specials dating back to the 1990s.|$|E
