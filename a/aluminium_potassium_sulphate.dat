The active ingredient is a sterile filtrate of an alum-precipitated anthrax antigen from the Sterne strain {{in a solution}} for injection. The other ingredients are <b>aluminium</b> <b>potassium</b> <b>sulphate,</b> sodium chloride and purified water. The preservative is thiomersal (0.005%). The vaccine is given by intramuscular injection and the primary course of four single injections (3 injections 3 weeks apart, followed by a 6-month dose) {{is followed by a}} single booster dose given once a year.

30|$|Aluminium salts ({{aluminium}} hydroxide, aluminium phosphate, <b>aluminium</b> <b>potassium</b> <b>sulphate)</b> {{are widely}} used as adjuvants in vaccines and in allergy immunoterapy, due to their immunogenic effect. This activity, {{once thought to be}} due to “depot” effect, is probable caused by an increased activity of antigen presenting cells or by an increase of cytokines and complement production [74]. DTP, hepatitis A and B, Haemophilus Influentiae B vaccines are prepared adsorbing the antigens in either an aluminium hydroxide or aluminium phosphate gel. As an alternative, antigens are precipitated in a solution of alum. Interestingly, children are anyhow exposed to aluminium salts since they are also detectable in breast milk and in artificial powder milk. No anaphylaxis to aluminium salts have been reported. The most known and frequent reaction is a palpable nodule at the injection site [75]. Sterile abscesses [76], localized or systemic dermatitis due to aluminium salts have been reported [53].|$|E

The strategy of the cultivation procedure included the following: the use of VL 55 growth medium supplemented with 0. 05 % xylan as the carbon source and solidified with gellan gum; incubation under hypoxic conditions (2 % O 2 [vol/vol], 2 % CO 2 [vol/vol], and 96 % N 2 [vol/vol]) for a relatively long period; inclusion of <b>aluminium</b> <b>potassium</b> <b>sulphate</b> in the growth medium; and soil dilution and plating. Of the 456 colonies recovered on the growth medium and subjected to PCR screening, three colonies belonging to Acidobacteria subdivision 1 and one colony belonging to Acidobacteria subdivision 3 were detected. The use of 16 S rRNA gene based clone libraries comprising 437 clones confirmed {{that members of the}} phylum Acidobacteria grew primarily on plates on wich acidobacterial colonies were detected by PCR screening. The clones in the libraries consisted predominantly of Proteobacteria (orders Burkholderiales and Xanthomonadales).

40|$|In {{order to}} produce {{drinking}} water, coagulants - such as aluminium salts - are widely used for precipitation and separation of impurities from raw water. The residual from the process is sludge, which presents a disposal problem. The REAL process is a method for recycling the aluminium from the sludge. In a first step, the aluminium hydroxide is dissolved in sulphuric acid. In a second step, an ultra filtration will separate all suspended matter and large molecules, leaving a concentrate of 15 - 20 % dry solids. The permeate will contain the trivalent aluminium ions together with 30 - 50 % of the organic contaminants. In a third step, by concentrating the permeate in a nano filter, the concentration of aluminium will be high enough to, in a fourth step, be precipitated with <b>potassium</b> <b>sulphate</b> to form a pure crystal: <b>potassium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>sulphate.</b> The <b>potassium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>sulphate</b> is comparable to standard aluminium sulphate. The process will give a residual in form of a concentrate from the ultra filtration, representing a few per cent of the incoming volume.

40|$|Since {{many years}} {{regional}} and national crystal growing competitions are successfully organized for pupils {{in countries such as}} Australia, Belgium, Canada, England, France and Singapore, and for sure in many schools on a more local basis. For most competitions pupils have to grow single crystals in the class room during a limited period of time (e. g. four weeks) of a limited amount of starting material provided by the organizers. Submitted single crystals are then judged by a jury based on the weight {{and the quality of the}} crystal. Typical compounds used as starting materials for such competitions are alum (<b>aluminium</b> <b>potassium</b> <b>sulphate</b> dodecahydrate), copper (II) sulphate pentahydrate, borax (sodium tetraborate decahydrate), ammonium iron (II) sulphate hexahydrate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate and ammonium magnesium sulphate hexahydrate. To celebrate the International Year of Crystallography a small IUCr working group of coordinators of current crystal growing competitions took the initiative to stimulate as many countries as possible to organize a regional or national crystal growing competition. To facilitate this, the IUCr offers all possible support for newcomers in the form of a time line, protocols and suggestions for judging and prize awarding. This information is available on the IYCr website www. iycr 2014. org/participate/crystal-growing-competition, together with a brand new animated video 'How to grow a single crystal - with Johanna' illustrating the protocol. With the celebrations of the International Year of Crystallography in mind the lead partners IUCr and UNESCO organize also a world-wide crystal growing competition. The aim of this competition is that participants grow their own crystals (whether involved in a regional/national competition or not) and convey their experience through a short video or essay. A panel of judges will evaluate the entries using criteria such as creativity, esthetic value, description of working plan and experimental work, clarity of explanations and scientific background. For countries were no crystallographers can take the lead to initiate a competition in 2014 the network of UNESCO schools will be used, an initiative which will start in September 2014. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The {{investigations}} {{involving the}} effect of ionization on the yields of radiation- chemical reaction in aqueous solutions suggest radi-cal diffusion model for various radiation-induced chemical reactions in aqueous media. Gamma radiolysis of acidic stannous chloride solu-tion at various absorbed doses and in presence of additives has been investigated. G(-Sn 2 +) is higher at the lower gamma dose. At the higher doses beyond 10 kGy the G values remain constant. The additives enhance the radiolytic transformation of stannous by energy transfer process. Presumably the additives exhibit sensitization effect. Efficiency of sensitization depends {{on the nature of}} the additives, concentration in the admixture and the absorbed dose. The additives were used in high concentration in contrast to the stannous chloride solutions. Thus, protection might be due to the shielding effect rather than scavenging.

Under these conditions the depolarisation factors of the Raman lines belonging to the totally symmetric (A), the doubly degenerate (E) and the triply degenerate (F) modes should be respectively = 1, > 1 and < 1. The characteristic Raman line of CaF 2 at 322 cm- 1 exhibited a depolarisation value less than 1, showing thereby that the corresponding mode is a triply degenerate one (F).
