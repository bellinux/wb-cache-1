5|$|Green-head ants are prey for {{a number}} of predators, {{including}} assassin bugs and the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus), in the faeces of which have been found worker ants. Birds also eat these ants, including the Australian white ibis (Threskiornis moluccus), black kite (Milvus migrans), masked lapwing (Vanellus miles) and the <b>Australian</b> <b>owlet-nightjar</b> (Aegotheles cristatus). Workers and larvae can be infected by parasites; examined workers were seen with late-stage pupae of an unidentified parasite in their thoraces. In some nests of the green-head ant, some myrmecophilous insects such as the beetle Chlamydopsis longipes are sometimes seen living inside colonies.|$|E
50|$|The New Caledonian owlet-nightjar (Aegotheles savesi) {{also known}} as the enigmatic owlet-nightjar, is a large owlet-nightjar (a kind of bird related to swifts and goatsuckers) with vermiculated grey-brown and black plumage. It has a long, {{slightly}} rounded tail, short, rounded wings, and long, stout legs. Its voice is unknown but similar birds make churring and whistling sounds. It is much larger than the related <b>Australian</b> <b>owlet-nightjar.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Australian</b> <b>owlet-nightjar</b> (Aegotheles cristatus) is a {{nocturnal bird}} found in open {{woodland}} across Australia and in southern New Guinea. It is colloquially {{known as the}} moth owl. It {{is the most common}} of the owlet-nightjars, and the best known of this secretive family. It is the most common nocturnal bird in Australia, and despite suffering from predation and competition by introduced species it is not considered threatened.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Australian</b> <b>owlet-nightjar</b> feeds {{at night}} by diving from perches and {{snatching}} insects from the air, ground or off trunks and branches, {{in the manner}} of a flycatcher. It may also feed on the wing. It feeds on most insects, particularly beetles, grasshoppers and ants. During the day they roost in hollows in trees, partly for protection from predators and partly to avoid being mobbed by other birds that mistake them for owls.|$|E
50|$|The barred owlet-nightjar (Aegotheles bennettii) is {{a species}} of bird in the owlet-nightjar family Aegothelidae. It is found in New Guinea. The species was {{originally}} {{thought to be the}} same species as the <b>Australian</b> <b>owlet-nightjar,</b> until that species was found within the range of the barred owlet-nightjar. It was also considered to be the same species as the Vogelkop owlet-nightjar. There are three subspecies, the nominate, from south-eastern New Guinea, A. b. wiedenfeldi from northern New Guinea, and A. b. plumifer from the D’Entrecasteaux Islands.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Australian</b> <b>owlet-nightjar</b> nests {{mainly in}} holes in trees (or in other holes and crevices), which is {{provisioned}} with leaves by {{both of the}} pair. It is thought that the frequent addition of eucalyptus leaves is because they act as a beneficial insecticide. Three or four eggs are laid, and incubated by the female for just under a month. Both the adults feed the chicks, which fledge after a month. The young birds are reported {{to stay close to}} the parents for several months after they fledge.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Australian</b> <b>owlet-nightjar</b> is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} owlet-nightjar with grey upperparts and a white, barred front and a distinct dark and pale patterning on the head. In the north of Australia females can also have a rufous morph. The plumage is overall paler in desert populations. It is adapted to live in open woodland, with more pointed wings and larger feet, unlike {{most of the rest}} of the family that live in dense forest (though some can and do live in such habitat in Queensland and New Guinea) [...] It lives in a variety of habitats as well as open woodland, including mangrove swamps, grasslands, mallee scrub as well as dense forest.|$|E
50|$|The noisy miner colony unites to mob inter-specific intruders and predators. The noisy miner will {{approach}} the threat closely and point, expose eye patches, and often bill-snap. Five to fifteen birds will fly around the intruder, some birds diving {{at it and}} either pulling away or striking the intruder. The mobbing continues until the intruder remains still, as with a tawny frogmouth (Podargus strigoides), or it leaves the area. Mobbing of snakes and goannas is particularly intense, and most species of bird, even non-predators, entering the territory are immediately chased. The noisy miner has been recorded attacking an <b>Australian</b> <b>owlet-nightjar</b> (Aegotheles cristatus) during the day, grebes, herons, ducks and cormorants on lakes {{at the edge of}} territories, crested pigeons (Ocyphaps lophotes), pardalotes, and rosellas. Non-predatory mammals such as bats, cattle, sheep, and wallabies are also attacked, though less vigorously than birds.|$|E

40|$|We report three {{developments}} toward {{resolving the}} challenge of the apparent basal polytomy of neoavian birds. First, we describe improved conditional down-weighting techniques to reduce noise relative to signal for deeper divergences and find increased agreement between data sets. Second, we present formulae for calculating the probabilities of finding predefined groupings in the optimal tree. Finally, we report a significant increase in data: nine new mitochondrial (mt) genomes (the dollarbird, New Zealand kingfisher, great potoo, <b>Australian</b> <b>owlet-nightjar,</b> white-tailed trogon, barn owl, a roadrunner [a ground cuckoo], New Zealand long-tailed cuckoo, and the peach-faced lovebird) and together they provide data for each of the six main groups of Neoaves proposed by Cracraft J (2001). We use his six main groups of modern birds as priors for evaluation of results. These include passerines, cuckoos, parrots, and three other groups termed “WoodKing” (woodpeckers/rollers/kingfishers), “SCA” (owls/potoos/owlet-nightjars/hummingbirds/swifts), and “Conglomerati. ” In general, the support is highly significant with just two exceptions, the owls move from the “SCA” group to the raptors, particularly accipitrids (buzzards/eagles) and the osprey, and the shorebirds may be an independent group {{from the rest of the}} “Conglomerati”. Molecular dating mt genomes support a major diversification of at least 12 neoavian lineages in the Late Cretaceous. Our results form a basis for further testing with both nuclear-coding sequences and rare genomic changes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Energy-conserving torpor is {{characterized}} by pronounced reductions in body temperature and metabolic rate and, in Australian birds, is known {{to occur in the}} Caprimulgiformes (spotted nightjar, <b>Australian</b> <b>owlet-nightjar,</b> tawny frogmouth), Apodiformes (white-throated needletail) and the Passeriformes (dusky woodswallow). Anecdotal evidence suggests that it also may occur in the white-fronted honeyeater, crimson chat, banded whiteface, red-capped robin, white-backed swallow, mistletoebird, and perhaps welcome swallow. Daily torpor (bouts lasting for several hours) appears to be the most common pattern, although anecdotal evidence indicates that white-backed swallows can undergo prolonged torpor. Diurnal birds enter torpor only during the night but nocturnal birds may use it by the day and/or night, and often in more than one bout/day. Body temperatures fall from ~ 38 – 41 °C during activity to ~ 29 °C during torpor in spotted nightjars, tawny frogmouths, dusky woodswallows and white-throated needletails, and to ~ 22 °C in Australian owlet-nightjars. In the spotted nightjar, a reduction in Tb by ~ 10 °C resulted in a 75 % reduction in metabolic rate, emphasizing energy conservation potential. Since torpor is likely to be more crucial for the survival of small birds, a detailed understanding of its use is important, not only for physiolo-gists but also ecologists and wildlife managers. It is thus disappointing that so much information on torpidity in Australian birds is anecdotal, and that so little effort has been made to characterize its patterns and quantify the resulting energy savings and survival benefits for birds in the wild.
