For the role, Stone kept her natural blonde hair color, rather than maintaining her usual dyed red hair. She felt {{that she had a}} responsibility to educate herself on Spider-Man, admitting she [...] "hadn't read the comic book growing up, and my experience was with the Sam Raimi movies... I always assumed that Mary [...] Jane was his first love", and having only been familiar with her The Help co-star Bryce Dallas Howard's portrayal in Spider-Man 3. Stone said, [...] "There's <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> really wants to please people [...] love Spider-Man or Gwen Stacy and want her to be done justice. I hope they'll give me license to interpret her my way." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Ausiello spoke {{further on}} Katherine Heigl's {{perspective}} on Izzie's departure. He said, [...] " [...] thinks her Jan. 21 farewell - while not {{originally intended to}} be her last episode - oddly works as a bookend to Izzie's story. [...] "Even though there's <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{would like to go}} back and do the quick Izzie farewell, [...] " [...] she says, [...] "I also think that my last scene - where Meredith says to Izzie, 'Don't go, we're your family,' and Izzie's response was, 'No you're not, you're just a bunch of people I worked with, and I can find that anywhere' - was kind of tragic and appropriate all at the same time. When I was playing the scene I was really trying to convey that, for Izzie, that was a lie that she had to tell herself to have the courage to have to move on." ...|$|E
500|$|Love {{has been}} candid about her diverse musical influences, the {{earliest}} being Patti Smith and The Pretenders, whom she discovered while in juvenile hall. As a teenager, she named Flipper, Kate Bush, Soft Cell, Joni Mitchell, Laura Nyro, Lou Reed, and Dead Kennedys among her favorite artists, {{as well as}} several new wave and post-punk bands, such as Echo and the Bunnymen, The Smiths, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Television, Bauhaus, and Joy Division. While in Ireland at age fifteen, she saw Virgin Prunes perform live in Dublin, an event she credited as being a pivotal influence. Her varying genre interests were illustrated in a 1991 interview with Flipside, in which she stated: [...] "There's <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> wants to have a grindcore band and another that wants to have a Raspberries-type pop band." [...] Love also embraced the influence of experimental artists and punk rock groups, including Sonic Youth, Swans, Big Black, Diamanda Galás, the Germs, and The Stooges. While writing Celebrity Skin, Love was mainly influenced by Neil Young and My Bloody Valentine. She also cited her contemporary PJ Harvey as an influence, saying, [...] "The one rock star that makes me know I'm shit is Polly Harvey. I'm nothing next to the purity that she experiences." ...|$|E

500|$|Speculation resumed, however, when Dean Morgan {{returned}} to the show {{for a second time}} in its fifth season. Cast member James Pickens, Jr. announced that both Heigl and T.R. Knight were set to depart from the show, but he later retracted his comment. During the course of the fifth season, Izzie was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) which spread to her liver, skin and brain. Following the show's one-hundredth episode wrap party, Heigl revealed she did not know if Izzie would survive, as no one on the production team would disclose her character's fate to her. It was confirmed in June 2009 that Heigl would return as Izzie for the show's sixth season. Heigl's appearances in the season were sporadic, seeing Izzie depart and return twice. Although she was scheduled to appear in the final five episodes of the season, Heigl requested that she be released from her contract 18months early, and made her final appearance on January 21, 2010. Heigl explained that she wanted {{to spend more time with}} her family, and did not think it would be respectful to Grey's Anatomy viewers to have Izzie return and depart yet again. Michael Ausiello spoke further on Katherine Heigl's perspective on Izzie's departure. He said, [...] " [...] thinks her Jan. 21 farewell - while not originally intended to be her last episode - oddly works as a bookend to Izzie's story.

So - I wasn't actually in high school - so my mentality was what - I'm living my own life; I'm a spirited, young woman; I can handle this; I can handle anything.

2500|$|Yee {{is accused}} of dealing {{firearms}} without a license and illegally importing firearms. He is also accused of accepting [...] "tens {{of thousands of dollars}} in campaign contributions and cash payments to provide introductions, help a client get a contract, and influence legislation." [...] Yee and his campaign staff accepted at least $42,800 from undercover FBI agents in exchange for carrying out specific requests. Yee discussed the opportunity for an agent to get weapons worth up to $2.5 million from a Muslim separatist group in the Philippines to bring them to the US. He told the agent, [...] "There's <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> wants to be like you. You know how I'm going to be like you? Just be a free agent there." [...] Yee was arrested on March 26, 2014 and charged with six counts of depriving the public of honest services and one count of conspiracy to traffic guns without a license. He was released on $500,000 bail.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, Hole drew {{inspiration}} from no wave and experimental bands, which is evident in their earliest recordings, specifically [...] "Retard Girl", but frontwoman Love also drew {{from a variety of}} influences. Love cited post-punk groups such as Echo and the Bunnymen and Joy Division, and classic rock such as Neil Young and Fleetwood Mac. The band's first album, Pretty on the Inside, was heavily influenced by noise and punk rock, using discordant melodies, distortion, and feedback, with Love's vocals ranging from whispers to guttural screams. Love described the band's earliest songwriting as being based on [...] "really crazy Sonic Youth tunings." [...] Nonetheless, Love claimed to have aimed for a pop sound early on: [...] "There's <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> wants to have a grindcore band and another that wants to have a Raspberries-type pop band," [...] she told Flipside magazine in 1991. Both Love and Erlandson were fans of the notorious LA punk band the Germs. In a 1996 interview for a Germs tribute documentary, Erlandson said: [...] "I think every band is based on one song, and our band was based on [...] "Forming"... Courtney brought it into rehearsal, and she knew, like, three chords and it was the only punk rock song we could play." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band (minus drummer William Goldsmith) {{relocated}} to Hollywood's Grandmaster Recorders in February 1997, described by Mendel as [...] "a small studio that sometimes moonlighted as a porn set, and looked the part." [...] For {{a period of}} four weeks, the band re-recorded most of the album with Grohl performing the drum tracks. It started with only [...] "Monkey Wrench" [...] as Grohl and Norton felt the drums needed more work, but eventually Goldsmith's drums remained on only two tracks, [...] "Doll" [...] and [...] "Up in Arms". According to Grohl, Goldsmith's drumming had good moments, but his performances mostly did not fit what Grohl had conceived for the drum track, so the frontman decided to redo them himself. Goldsmith even asked if he should go to Los Angeles, but Grohl dismissed this by saying he was only performing overdubs. Once Mendel told Goldsmith the situation, Grohl said that despite replacing Goldsmith's tracks, he still wanted him as a bandmember, but the disgruntled drummer {{decided to leave the}} Foo Fighters instead. Speaking about the tension surrounding the departure of Goldsmith, Grohl in 2011 said, [...] "There were a lot of reasons it didn't work out... but there was also <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> was like, you know, I don't know if I'm finished playing the drums yet." [...] He would also state, [...] "I wish that I would have handled things differently..." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{do not say}} the {{experience}} was so explicit as all this; no experience so mystical could be so explicit; and perhaps what was intimated to me in it was only that if I sometime meant to ask some gentle reader's company in a retrospect of my Spanish travels, I had better be honest with him and own at the beginning that passion for Spanish things which was the ruling passion of my boyhood; I had better confess that, however unrequited, it held me in the eager bondage of a lover still, so that I never wished to escape from it, but must try {{to hide the fact}} whenever the real Spain fell below the ideal, however I might reason with my infatuation or try to scoff it away. It had once been so inextinguishable <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the record of my journey must be more or less autobiographical; and though I should decently endeavor to keep my past out of it, perhaps I should not try very hard and should not always succeed.|$|E
