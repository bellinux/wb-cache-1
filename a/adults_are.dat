5|$|Psylliodes luridipennis <b>adults</b> <b>are</b> oblong-ovate, and {{the same}} size and build as P. hyoscyami, but not as broad, {{measuring}} between 2.8 and 3.6mm in length. They have a brassy-green head and thorax, shining reddish-brown elytra and brassy-green legs. The hind femora are brassy in colour but paler at the base, and the antennae are brick-red. The <b>adults</b> <b>are</b> fully winged, and are capable of flight.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms may be {{different}} in adults and children; the main symptoms in <b>adults</b> <b>are</b> headache, abdominal pain, memory loss, kidney failure, male reproductive problems, and weakness, pain, or tingling in the extremities.|$|E
5|$|The adult has {{two pairs}} of long, narrow, multiveined, {{translucent}} wings and a long, slender abdomen. Although they somewhat resemble dragonflies or damselflies, they belong to a different infraclass of winged insects. Antlion <b>adults</b> <b>are</b> easily distinguished from damselflies by their prominent, apically clubbed antennae which are {{about as long as}} the head and thorax combined. Also, the pattern of wing venation differs, and compared to damselflies, the <b>adults</b> <b>are</b> very feeble fliers and are normally found fluttering about at night in search of a mate. Adult antlions are typically nocturnal, and rarely seen by day.|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 5.2-6.1 mm. Larvae {{have been}} found in October and <b>adults</b> <b>were</b> reared from February to May, one <b>adult</b> <b>was</b> collected in July in Korea. There are probably at least two generations per year.|$|R

5|$|Weaning: When young rats are weaning {{and eating}} solid foods {{for the first}} time, they use adult rats as guides. They forage where the <b>adults</b> <b>are</b> {{foraging}} or where adults have previously scent-marked.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2005 survey, 27% of German <b>adults</b> <b>are</b> smokers. Obesity in Germany {{has been}} {{increasingly}} {{cited as a}} major health issue. A 2007 study shows Germany has {{the highest number of}} overweight people in Europe.|$|E

5|$|<b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> {{extremely}} mobile {{during the}} day, and find refuge in resting sites in flowers and young leaves {{at night and}} early morning. They migrate from crop to crop following flower availability. Field density can vary. In France, numbers are around 20 adults/100 plants {{at the beginning of}} the colonization and 150 adults/100 plants at population peak when pressure is high.|$|E
5|$|<b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> mostly white, but {{the front}} {{half of the}} rostrum, and {{the sides of the}} abdomen, are pink. Bright red bands extend across the base of the rostrum, the {{posterior}} edge of the carapace, the chelipeds, and each of the abdominal segments. The dorsal parts of the abdomen are brown, and there are two brown saddles on the dorsal carapace.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{differences}} in morphology and development are seen. In the desert locust and the migratory locust, for example, the gregaria nymphs become darker with strongly contrasting yellow and black markings, they grow larger, and have longer developmental periods. The <b>adults</b> <b>are</b> larger with different body proportions, less sexual dimorphism, and higher metabolic rates. They mature more rapidly and start reproducing earlier, but have {{lower levels of}} fecundity.|$|E

5|$|Birds are {{the primary}} natural enemies of the Sirex woodwasp. The <b>adults</b> <b>are</b> {{frequently}} hunted by swallows (Hirundidae) and swifts (Apodidae), both of which prefer males. The black woodpecker (Dryocopius martius) and great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopus major) consume some larvae, but do not specialize on the Sirex woodwasp.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches have {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, {{meaning that}} the nymphs are generally similar to the adults, except for undeveloped wings and genitalia. Development is generally slow, and may take {{a few months to}} over a year. The <b>adults</b> <b>are</b> also long-lived, and have survived for as much as four years in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Early {{symptoms}} of lead poisoning in <b>adults</b> <b>are</b> commonly nonspecific and include depression, loss of appetite, intermittent abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and muscle pain. Other early signs in adults include malaise, fatigue, decreased libido, and problems with sleep. An unusual taste {{in the mouth}} and personality changes are also early signs.|$|E

5|$|Grasshoppers have a {{wide range}} of predators at {{different}} stages of their lives; eggs are eaten by bee-flies, ground beetles and blister beetles; hoppers and <b>adults</b> <b>are</b> taken by other insects such as ants, robber flies and sphecid wasps, by spiders, and by many birds and small mammals.|$|E
5|$|In Western countries, {{the number}} of new episodes per year has been {{estimated}} to be between 0.89 and 1.89 cases per 100,000 people. Children and young <b>adults</b> <b>are</b> less likely to be affected than the elderly: the risk increases by 20% for every decade of life. Men are more likely to develop Guillain–Barré syndrome than women; the relative risk for men is 1.78 compared to women.|$|E
5|$|Sebrights {{are neither}} {{prolific}} egg layers, nor outstanding meat birds. They can {{prove to be}} particularly difficult to raise, especially for beginners.

5|$|The adult caddisfly is a {{medium-sized}} insect with membranous, hairy wings, which {{are held in}} a tent-wise fashion when the insect is at rest. The antennae are fairly long and threadlike, the mouthparts are reduced in size and the legs have five tarsi (lower leg joints). <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> nocturnal and are attracted to light. Some species are strong fliers and can disperse to new localities, but many fly only weakly. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> usually short-lived, most being non-feeders and equipped only to breed. Once mated, the female caddisfly lays eggs in a gelatinous mass, attaching them above or below the water surface depending on species. The eggs hatch in a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|This {{vulnerability}} as {{it relates}} to low working memory capacity individuals and seductive details within textual information can also be seen as a difference between children and adult learners. Because adults, on average, having a higher working memory capacity than children, <b>adults</b> <b>are</b> less affected by seductive details than children.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{pedagogical}} relation the <b>adult</b> <b>is</b> {{directed toward the}} child. The relation is asymmetrical, unlike many other personal relationships (e.g. friendship).
