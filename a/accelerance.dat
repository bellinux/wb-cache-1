Amongst many sources of microvibration onboard, reaction wheel and momentum wheel assemblies are often {{considered the most}} significant. This thesis presents the development and validation of microvibration models for a cantilever configured wheel assembly designed with a soft-suspension system. Wheel assembly induced microvibrations under hard-mounted and coupled boundary conditions are studied. In particular, the wheel assembly semi-analytical microvibration model in a hard-mounted boundary condition is developed with harmonic excitations and the traditionally ignored broadband noise excitations are included. Some peculiar dynamics such as nonlinearity in the motor and high damping of the soft-suspension system are observed from the hard-mounted measurements conducted on a bespoke dynamometer. Modeling strategies for these peculiar dynamics are developed and implemented in the wheel assembly microvibration modeling. This includes a systematic approach to extract stiffness and damping values of the suspension system, considering nonlinearity and high damping from measurements. The microvibrations produced by the wheel assembly in a coupled boundary condition are studied using a seismic mass to support the wheel assembly. A coupled microvibration measurement system, which allows the wheel assembly interface loads to be reconstructed by measuring the response accelerations on the seismic mass, is designed, built and validated. In addition, the wheel assembly driving point static and dynamic <b>accelerance</b> are measured and analytical expressions of the driving point dynamic <b>accelerance</b> are derived. The coupled microvibrations are predicted with wheel assembly static <b>accelerance,</b> dynamic <b>accelerance</b> and the standard method (i. e. no wheel <b>accelerance).</b> The predicted results {{have shown that the}} method developed in this thesis which uses the wheel assembly dynamic <b>accelerance</b> accurately simulates the microvibrations observed in practice...|$|E

A RWA-seismic mass coupled microvibration measurement system is presented and its model validated against test results. The importance of the RWA driving point accelerances in coupled microvibration analysis is thoroughly discussed. A RWA <b>accelerance</b> measurement system {{has been designed to}} measure the driving point accelerances in both static (flywheel not spinning) and dynamic (flywheel spinning) conditions. Analytically, RWA static <b>accelerance</b> is obtained by frequency response analysis of a finite element model. The traditionally ignored gyroscopic effects in the accelerances are included in the model and their effects with respect to traditional models are shown both theoretically and experimentally. Although at high angular speed, when nonlinearities in the microvibrations prevent an accurate simulation, it is shown that the predicted microvibrations match more closely with the test results when considering gyroscopic effects in RWA accelerances than those predicted using the traditional method.

A developing technology that appears promising is space-based interferometry, which uses multiple apertures separated at great distances to act as a large virtual aperture. In this way, interferometers will achieve angular resolutions far greater than those achievable by monolithic telescopes. In this thesis, we investigate the dynamics and control of two proposed architectures for spaceborne interferometers: structurally connected interferometers and electromagnetic formation flying interferometers. For structurally connected interferometers, we develop a coupled disturbance analysis method that accurately predicts a space telescope's optical performance in the presence of reaction wheel vibrational disturbances. This method "couples" a reaction wheel to a structure using estimates of the <b>accelerances</b> (or mobilities) of both bodies. This coupled analysis method is validated on the Micro-Precision Interferometer testbed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The predictions show great improvement over a simplified "decoupled" analysis method when compared to experimental data. For formation flying interferometers, we consider the use of electromagnets as relative position actuators. A high fidelity, nonlinear dynamic model of a deep-space electromagnetic formation flight (EMFF) array is derived from first principles. The nonlinear dynamics are linearized for a two-vehicle array about a nominal trajectory, and the linearzed model is shown to be unstable,(cont.) but controllable, and therefore stabilizable. A linear optimal controller is designed for the system and implemented to form the closed-loop dynamics. Time simulations of the closed-loop nonlinear dynamics demonstrate that EMFF using linear control proves very effective, despite the nonlinearities of the system's dynamics and the electromagnetic actuators. by Laila Mireille Elias.

To achieve this goal, a slotted stand-off layer damping treatment has been developed, and a compound track model with this treatment is developed for investigating the effectiveness of this treatment in terms of the vibration reduction. Through the dynamic analysis of the track undergoing the slotted stand-off layer damping treatment, some guidelines are proposed on the selection of materials and structure parameters for this treatment. In addition, the prototype of the optimal slotted stand-off layer damping treatment has been built and tested in the laboratory.

40|$|To {{experimentally}} {{determine the}} multidirectional driving point and transfer <b>accelerance</b> matrices {{is a difficult}} task that has remained unsolved for 30 years. These matrices relate both linear and rotational degrees of freedom in three dimensions. The direct measurement of dynamic moments and rotational accelerations is very difficult. Little work exists on the subject and none includes so many DOF 2 ̆ 7 s. Besides, {{it is assumed that}} any test attachment is rigid and none used angular accelerometers to measure the angular acceleration;Various errors in substructure testing are studied. The study reveals that the interface DOF deficiency error is the most catastrophic and sophisticated error. None of interfacial DOF 2 ̆ 7 s can be neglected. The bias error can be corrected easily. The noise error appears to be most severe in the low frequency range. The exciter rocking motion leads to incorrect bare vehicle transmissibility matrix and incorrect global transmissibility matrix. The driving point difference error increases quickly as the distance between the impact and measurement points increases;The DOF deficiency error has several sources. It comes from the difference between the inverse from a complete interface model and the inverse of a reduced interface model. It also comes from the deletion of cross coupling terms between the neglected motions and remaining forces, the neglected forces and the remaining motions, and the neglected forces and the neglected motions;A number of numerical-experimental hybrid measurement methods are proposed and evaluated for finding the multidirectional driving point and transfer point <b>accelerance</b> matrices in both 2 D and 3 D. These methods are tested for their robustness under conditions of noisy data.

Using the concept of Optimum Equivalent Linear FRF (OELF), <b>accelerance</b> FRFs were measured at different random excitation levels which demonstrated the nonlinear behavior of the adhesive. Using a finite element model, the sensitivity analysis showed that the selected FRFs are more sensitive to the storage and loss moduli of the adhesive near the resonances. Therefore, firstly, both of the storage and loss moduli were identified near each resonance separately and the results have been compared with the results based on Inverse Eigen-sensitivity Method (IEM). In continuation, five viscoelastic constitutive models were utilized and identified to characterize the dynamic mechanical properties of the adhesive at different excitation levels. Applying the identified models, the correlation between the FRFs of the FE models and the experimental ones were tested.

To study comfort, one metric that has been put forward is the measurement of the power absorbed at the cyclist's hands. Measuring absorbed power requires the use of the force and the velocity at the hands and provides an overall energy-based quantity. The aim {{of this study is to}} dynamically calibrate an instrumented brake hood transducer to measure the power absorbed at the cyclist's hands. Using a base excitation technique involving suspended masses, dynamic calibration of the brake hood was conducted in the 3 - 100 Hz frequency range, and the force transducer sensitivity and seismic mass were measured. An accelerometer attached to the brake hood enabled measurements of acceleration and calculation of velocity. A frequency-dependent phase mismatch between the force signal and the acceleration was obtained by measuring the <b>accelerance</b> at the hand-bike interface. A device called the Power Calibrator equipped with an impedance head was developed to assess the accuracy of the power measured by the instrumented brake hood. The results show that the instrumented brake hood can accurately measure the absorbed power at the cyclist's hands. Phase mismatch between the force and the velocity signals must be corrected to improve the accuracy of measurements. To implement the measurements, it is recommended that the calculations be done in the frequency domain...|$|E
40|$|Structure-borne {{sound from}} {{installed}} machinery is often transmitted into a receiver structure via many connection points and several co-ordinate directions {{at each of}} them. In order to quantify the contributions from the various connection points, the operational forces at the interfaces, or an equivalent set of forces at some other locations, should be determined. These forces may be combined with measured transfer functions to determine {{their contributions to the}} sound at the receiver locations. Inverse methods are becoming widely used, in which a matrix of measured accelerances is inverted at each frequency and used with operational acceleration data to find the forces. Due to poor conditioning of this matrix, however, the results can often be unreliable. In this paper, using both simulations and measurements, an assessment is made of the success and failure of various strategies for dealing with the problems of ill conditioning, in particular over-determination and singular value rejection. In each case the test structure is a rectangular plate, and a wide frequency range is covered to include regions of both low and high modal overlap. Critical for the rejection of singular values is a suitable threshold. It is established that previously used thresholds, based on estimates of error in either accelerances or operational responses, cannot be used universally. An alternative approach is developed in which the <b>accelerance</b> matrix is perturbed by a different amount for each sample of the operational responses. Based on this approach a more robust strategy is proposed which takes account simultaneously of the effect of errors in both the accelerances and operational responses...|$|E

To control this problem European Union regulations, including TSI (Technical Specifications for Interoperability) Noise, has come into force by implementing many strict norms on new railway vehicles put on the market. One TSI regulation is limiting the acceleration noise, which in turn calls for low noise solutions for drive systems which typically governs the vehicle noise at low speeds, up to around 80 Km/hr. This regulation on railway noise {{has become a major}} challenge for many train manufacturers. This calls for electromagnetic-Vibration-Acoustics multi physics analysis of the motor. The thesis mainly focuses on numerical modelling of the electromagnetic-vibro-acoustics system. Ideally such models can compute the audible magnetic sound power radiated from the motor as a function of its speed, PWM strategy applied and geometry. Here a pulse modulated permanent magnet traction motor was modelled with finite elements (FE), using a commercial software. Thereafter, the dynamic characteristics of the motor was analysed by FE modal analysis (eigen-frequencies and eigen-modes) as well as by point force frequency response analysis. The FE model was validated by comparing the Eigen-modes, Eigen-frequencies and point <b>accelerance</b> with the experimental modal analysis results. Thereafter, frequency response analysis was performed to calculate the vibration velocities {{on the surface of the}} stator frame using realistic electromagnetic forces.

40|$|Operational modal {{analysis}} (OMA) seeks {{to determine a}} structure’s dynamic characteristics from response-only measurements, which comprise both excitation and transmission path effects. The cepstrum has been used successfully {{in a number of}} applications to separate these source and path effects, after which the poles and zeros of the transfer function can be obtained via a curve-fitting process. The contributions from the individual poles and zeros can then be added (in log magnitude) to regenerate the frequency response function (FRF). Cepstrum-based OMA was originally developed in the 1980 s and 90 s, but {{there have been a number}} of recent developments that warrant discussion and explanation, and this is the basis of the present paper, which focusses on the FRF regeneration process and on a number of broader points explaining FRFs from a pole-zero perspective. The FRF regenerated from identified poles and zeros is subject to magnitude distortion from the effects of truncation, i. e., from the residual effects of out-of-band poles and zeros. As long as a reference FRF is available – for example from conventional experimental {{modal analysis}} or from a finite element model – this distortion can be corrected for using a magnitude equalisation curve. This paper discusses the nature of this equalisation curve, and gives recommendations on how best to obtain it. Other topics covered in the discussion are: the required distribution of poles and zeros for the successful regeneration of FRFs; node points and weak modes in a pole-zero model; the differences in pole-zero distribution between receptance, mobility and <b>accelerance</b> FRF forms; and, how to deal with the very low frequency region when regenerating FRFs. Special consideration is given to the identification of zeros – often masked by noise in response measurements – using transmissibility estimation. It is hoped that the discussion will assist in the application of cepstrum-based OMA methods and will lead to improved understanding of the FRF regeneration process and of frequency response functions more broadly...|$|E

The final version is available from Springer via the DOI in this record. In recent years, there have been extensive active vibration control (AVC) studies for the mitigation of human induced vibrations {{in a series of}} office floors, in which such vibrations are deemed to be 'problematic' and have been found to affect only certain sections of the floors. These floors are predominantly open-plan in layout and comprise of different structural configurations for their respective bays and this influences their dynamic characteristics. Most of the AVC studies have comprised extensive analytical predictions and experimental implementations of different controller schemes. The primary measures of vibration mitigation performance have been by frequency response function (FRF) measurements, responses to controlled walking tests, and in-service monitoring, all tests with and without AVC. This paper looks at AVC studies in three different office floor case studies in past field trials. Some of the estimated modal properties for each of these floors from experimental modal analysis (EMA) tests are shown as well as some selected mode shapes of fundamental modes of vibration. These reflect the variability in their dynamic characteristics by virtue of their different designs and thus the potential for their 'liveliness' under human induced excitation. An overview of some of the controller schemes pursued in the various field trials are mentioned as well as a brief insight being provided into some challenges encountered in their designs and the physical siting of the collocated sensor and actuator pairs used in the field trials. The measure for the vibration mitigation performances in this work {{is in the form of}} uncontrolled and controlled point <b>accelerance</b> FRFs which show attenuations in the target modes of vibration between 13 and 18 dB.

40|$|To {{construct}} an improved experimental and analytical foundation for studying seismic soil-structure interaction, an integrated research program is pursued {{to examine the}} dynamic response of surface foundations on sandy soils under both forced and ground motion disturbance. By virtue {{of a set of}} developments of the centrifuge scaled modeling including the shake-table method, a comprehensive experimental database for the free-field ground motion problem of a stratum, multi-mode forced vibration response 2 ̆ 7 s dependence to foundation configurations, as well as their corresponding seismic behavior under general base motion were developed. Through a comparison of the generated data with those from the classical homogeneous and inhomogeneous shear modulus soil models, the limitations of conventional theories in capturing the general planar modes of vibration was demonstrated. The theoretical/computational development of the research includes the formulation and implementation of a set of new adaptive-gradient boundary elements, an improved treatment of corner and edge problems in BEMs, multi-domain rigid/deformable surface/embedded foundation problems under multi-directional seismic ground motion, and alternative decompositions of wave scattering problems. With the aid of these developments, the complex interaction of a granular soil layer with footings subjected to eccentric dynamic loads and seismic ground motion was investigated. In the experimental phase of the investigation, a variety of scaled-model surface foundations were designed and tested dynamically on a large geotechnical centrifuge and characterized in terms of multi-directional <b>accelerance</b> functions or transfer functions in the frequency domain. Among various findings, it was found that for the common range of footing configurations, capturing the in-situ variation of the shear modulus of the soil is not sufficient to describe the dynamic structural-soil problem comprehensively. Aimed at capturing the near-field and far-field site effects deemed critical for the problem, the new two-zone continuum model was found to perform well in both the radiation and seismic problems with economy, providing comprehensive agreement with both forced vibration and seismic data. On the basis of the experimental data obtained, a pair of compact evolution equations were also developed to express the 2 key physical parameters of the model directly in terms of the foundation configuration...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic soil-foundation {{interaction}} {{is an important}} consideration {{in the design of}} structures subjected to dynamic loads such as earthquakes, wind, machine vibration, vehicle loading, and impacts. One reason for this importance is that soil-structure interaction (SSI) can have detrimental effects on the dynamic response of soil-foundation-structure systems. However, present theories and solutions for dynamic soil-pile interaction can be quite complex and contain several parameters that are not known {{with a high degree of}} certainty. Additionally, several aspects of dynamic soil-pile interaction problems are difficult to characterize accurately, such as the highly-nonhomogeneous spatial distribution of soil properties, the nonlinear and stress-dependent mechanical response of soil, variable soil-pile contact conditions, and complexities of 3 D wave propagation in nonhomogeneous media. Despite significant advancements in theoretical and experimental research on dynamic soil-pile interaction, many of the available simplified approaches as well as sophisticated numerical models fail to accurately capture the observed responses from realistic multi-modal experiments. To help bridge the knowledge-gap between existing theories and experimental observations for dynamic soil-pile interaction problems, a program of full-scale dynamic field tests were performed in this study using two identical H-piles at the same site containing soft clay. One pile was installed in the natural soil profile, and the other was partially embedded in an improved soil-cement zone. A new servo-hydraulic inertial shaker testing system and modular pile-cap were developed, then used to perform forced-vibration tests on the piles using random vibration techniques. Three different types and intensities of broadband excitation were applied to the system using the shaker installed on the pile cap in three different testing configurations. For the first time, the multi-modal vertical-eccentric (VE) dynamic test, first developed for scaled-model geotechnical centrifuge experiments, was performed on full-scale pile foundations in natural soil conditions, and verified to simultaneously capture the important aspects of the vertical, horizontal, and coupled horizontal-rocking modes of vibration. A new set of theoretical centroidal <b>accelerance</b> solutions was developed for the dynamic response of soil-pile systems for which an inertial shaker moving in rigid body motion with the pile-cap provides the excitation. On the theoretical side, an existing approximate method was evaluated against the experiments as well a rigorous 3 D boundary element program. It was shown that the approximate method lacks accuracy in the low frequency region and also in characterizing the vertical mode of vibration for the actual soil and pile conditions encountered. Two sets of shear modulus and damping profiles were introduced based on cone penetration tests and widely-used empirical design equations, and the effect of the dynamic shear strain level in the soil surrounding the pile was investigated. The numerical models were then calibrated to minimize the mismatch between theory and experiment by introducing a multi-modal error function which accounts for the three centroidal modes of vibration, while employing relative weighing factors developed through parametric studies and engineering judgment. The method of impedance modification factors (IMF) and the advanced three-domain computational disturbed-zone model developed from centrifuge experimentation were extended for the first time to the full-scale pile tests and natural soil conditions. The results verified that the IMF method can capture the experimental response for the pile in unimproved soil very well. The three-domain disturbed-zone computational continuum model showed promise for simultaneously capturing the experimental centroidal horizontal and rotational peak frequencies using modulus and damping profiles in the disturbed zone that were generated through reasonable modifications of the far-field profiles...|$|E
