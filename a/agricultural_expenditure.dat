Total CAP expenditure is capped, so in the absence of further changes, payments to all the pre-2004 member countries will fall by 5% over this period. Some commentators claim that to a large extent, France gets twice the CAP payment received by the UK because it has twice the amount of farmland, although the extent to which there is a correlation between the two is disputed.|$|E
40|$|Using data on 34 {{countries}} in Africa {{south of the}} Sahara (SSA) from 1980 to 2012, this paper assesses the returns to public spending in the agricultural sector, considering expenditures on agriculture as a whole versus expenditures on agricultural research. First, an aggregate production function is estimated using a fixed-effects, instrumental variables estimator to address potential endogeneity of <b>agricultural</b> <b>expenditure</b> and to obtain elasticities of land productivity with respect to total <b>agricultural</b> <b>expenditure</b> and agricultural research expenditure. Different model specifications are {{used to test the}} sensitivity of the results to different assumptions. The estimated elasticities are then used to estimate the rate of return to expenditure in different countries and groups of countries. The elasticity of land productivity with respect to total <b>agricultural</b> <b>expenditure</b> per hectare is estimated at 0. 04, and elasticity with respect to agricultural research expenditure per hectare is estimated to be higher at 0. 09. The aggregate returns to total <b>agricultural</b> <b>expenditure</b> and agricultural research expenditure in SSA are estimated at 11 percent and 93 percent, respectively. Comparative analysis of the estimates with those of previous studies, as well as across different countries and different groups of countries, is undertaken.

Agricultural output is also modeled against a host of socio-economic, natural and human factors, which influence agricultural productivity. Applying Augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test, Ordinary Least Squares, and the Newey-West method on secondary data and dummy variable used in the study, {{it was found that}} agricultural output has negative and significant impact on life expectancy in Nigeria. The impact of <b>agricultural</b> <b>expenditure</b> was found to be positive but nonsignificant. Real gross domestic product and industrial output were also found to influence life expectancy. Careful examination of the hypothesized socio-economic factors (political instability and industrial output), natural factor (rainfall), and human factor (carbon emission) showed that only industrial output and rainfall matter for agricultural output in the country: both variables have positive impacts on agricultural output. The study submits that as much as agriculture may matter for economic development, reliance on the sector alone without corresponding and simultaneous development of other crucial sectors such as education, health, and industry will not yield positive fruits for economic development in Nigeria...|$|E

Significantly, the outcome of CAP reform is expected to have minimal impact on the 2004 budget, since the reforms will only be felt from 2005 onwards. Comment: The USDA review of the EU 2004 agricultural budget highlights a 33 % increase in EU expenditures on food safety. It should be noted that many food-safety measures were formerly categorised under the sectoral budget of the sector concerned. Their removal into a separate budgetary category removes them from the EU's self-imposed ceiling on CAP expenditures. Similarly {{it should be noted that}} rural-development expenditures have been removed from the formal calculation of the expenditures to which the new EU budgetary ceiling applies. It should also be noted that the EU contribution to rural-development programmes constitutes only around 50 % of the total financing made available to such programmes, with member governments, and occasionally private-sector associations, providing the remainder. This highlights the extent to which the EU will be expanding agricultural support in those areas not subject to ceilings.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether agricultural growth {{through public}} expenditure, ODA or investment will improve significantly {{the prospects of}} achieving MDG 1 of halving poverty in Asia and the Pacific Region. As {{more than a few}} countries in this Region recorded impressive economic growth {{in the early years of}} the present decade, the case for the widely used poverty threshold of US$ 1. 25 per day (at 2005 PPP) for assessing progress towards MDG 1 is not so compelling now. Accordingly, the present assessment uses two poverty thresholds: US$ 2 per day and US$ 1. 25 per day (both at 2005 PPP). Our analysis, based on country panel data, confirms robustly that increases in public <b>agricultural</b> <b>expenditure,</b> agricultural ODA, agricultural investment, or fertiliser use (as a proxy for technology), accelerate agricultural and GDP growth. Consequently, the headcount and depth of poverty indices are reduced substantially. Our simulation results show that, for halving the headcount index at US$ 2 per day, Asia and the Pacific region as a whole would need in 2007 - 13 a 56 % increase in annual agricultural ODA, a 28 % increase in <b>agricultural</b> <b>expenditure,</b> a 23 % increase in fertiliser use or a 24 % increase in agricultural investment. Aggregation of the simulation results for various groups reveals that countries in low income group, with a low level of macro governance or institutional quality, or with low ease of doing business would need larger increase in agricultural ODA, expenditure or investment to halve poverty. Although the share of agriculture in GDP has declined, our analysis reinforces the case for channelling a substantially larger flow of resources not just for accelerating growth but also for achieving the more ambitious MDG 1. A policy dilemma, however, is the trade-off between institutional quality and resource transfers. National governments and donors must reflect deeply on triggers for institutional reforms and mechanisms that would ensure larger outlays for agriculture and their allocation between rural infrastructure and sustainable technologies.

40|$|Burley tobacco {{production}} in Malawi was liberalized to permit production by smallholders {{in the early}} 1990 s. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to show which smallholders began producing burley tobacco after liberalization and which smallholders still continue to produce it. Analysis of the characteristics of burley tobacco producers shows that only smallholders who had adequate farm size and adequate funds could start to produce it. With regard to the farm size requirements, only smallholders who had enough acreage to sell tobacco on the auction floors and who had enough acreage to rotate crops could start to produce. With regard to the financial requirements, only smallholders who could procure funds through informal institutions or who possessed their own capital to meet the necessary <b>agricultural</b> <b>expenditures</b> could start. So, it was only the wealthy households which could start to produce tobacco after liberalization and continue to produce it.

40|$|<b>Agricultural</b> <b>expenditures</b> {{had been}} a major item of the EU budget over decades. Yet, {{consequent}} to extensive reforms that began in 1992, farming's share of the budget has been shrinking substantially. Expenditures for structural policies and competition have reached levels {{in excess of the}} agricultural budget. Nevertheless, transfers from the EU budget still represent a big chunk of the factor income for the agricultural sectors in all EU countries. Reductions in farm payments – as proposed in the consultation process preceding the debate on the new financial framework of the EU – would lead to a severe decline in farm incomes. This would accelerate structural change unless better market conditions were to compensate income losses from lower subsidies. Countries such as Austria or France would find their net payer position deteriorating because farm payments make up a large share of the return flows from the EU budget.
