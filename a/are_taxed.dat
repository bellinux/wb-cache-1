5|$|Other {{economists and}} analysts {{have argued that}} the {{underground}} economy would continue to bear the same tax burden as before. They state that replacing the current tax system with a consumption tax would not change the tax revenue generated from the underground economy—while illicit income is not taxed directly, spending of income from illicit activity results in business income and wages that <b>are</b> <b>taxed.</b>|$|E
25|$|Partnerships are not taxed, {{but their}} {{partners}} <b>are</b> <b>taxed</b> on their shares of partnership income. Residents and citizens <b>are</b> <b>taxed</b> on worldwide income, while nonresidents <b>are</b> <b>taxed</b> only on income within the jurisdiction. Several types of credits reduce tax, and {{some types of}} credits may exceed tax before credits. An alternative tax applies at the federal and some state levels.|$|E
25|$|Countries {{that tax}} income {{generally}} {{use one of}} two systems: territorial or residential. In the territorial system, only local income – income from a source inside the country – is taxed. In the residential system, residents of the country <b>are</b> <b>taxed</b> on their worldwide (local and foreign) income, while nonresidents <b>are</b> <b>taxed</b> only on their local income. In addition, {{a very small number}} of countries, notably the United States, also tax their nonresident citizens on worldwide income.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, {{investments}} in partnerships and Limited Liability Companies also have tax advantages. For individual owners of businesses, the LLC <b>is</b> <b>taxed</b> as a sole proprietorship. This {{means that the}} entity <b>is</b> not <b>taxed,</b> but the income earned by the entity <b>is</b> <b>taxed</b> to the owner. The LLC has important tax advantages, such as the owners profits potentially being taxed at the owners lower marginal tax bracket. Furthermore, losses can offset the sole proprietor’s non-business income. If there are multiple owners of a Limited Liability Company, there <b>is</b> also <b>tax</b> advantages associated with it. They can choose to <b>be</b> <b>taxed</b> as a partnership, {{but they can also}} decide to <b>be</b> <b>taxed</b> as a corporate-entity. Partnerships <b>are</b> not <b>taxed,</b> but corporations <b>are.</b> For LLCs <b>taxed</b> as partnerships the income <b>is</b> <b>taxed</b> to the partners. For a corporation or an LLC taxed like a corporation, the entity <b>is</b> subject to <b>tax</b> and dividends on after <b>tax</b> income <b>are</b> also <b>taxed</b> to the shareholders of the corporation or the members of the LLC.|$|R

25|$|The rate of {{corporation}} tax is 0% {{for almost all}} types of income; the only exceptions are that the profits of banks <b>are</b> <b>taxed</b> at 10%, as is rental (or other) income from land and buildings situated on the Isle of Man.|$|E
25|$|Corporate {{taxable profits}} (ordinary income) <b>are</b> <b>taxed</b> at a flat rate of 27%.

50|$|The second tax, the {{processors}} tax, {{applies to}} the processing of natural resources. It also {{is based on the}} taxable value of the natural resource. Timber processing <b>is</b> <b>taxed</b> at 0.375% of taxable value; processing of potash and molybdenum <b>is</b> <b>taxed</b> at 0.125%; and processing of all other resources <b>is</b> <b>taxed</b> at 0.75%.|$|R
50|$|A {{homestead}} exemption is {{most often}} only on a fixed monetary amount, such as the first $50,000 of the assessed value. The remainder <b>is</b> <b>taxed</b> at the normal rate. In that case, a home valued at $150,000 would then only <b>be</b> <b>taxed</b> on $100,000; a home valued at $75,000 would <b>be</b> <b>taxed</b> only on $25,000.|$|R

Some jurisdictions impose local option sales tax.|$|E
25|$|Although {{a federal}} wealth tax is {{prohibited}} by the United States Constitution unless the receipts are {{distributed to the}} States by their populations, {{state and local government}} property tax amount to a wealth tax on real estate, and because capital gains <b>are</b> <b>taxed</b> on nominal instead of inflation-adjusted profits, the capital gains tax amounts to a wealth tax on the inflation rate.|$|E
50|$|The {{king had}} {{limitations}} {{on how he}} could tax. He had {{to know when to}} tax as some times were better than others.

There is no local sales tax in Michigan. There is now a Michigan sales tax on {{the total amount of}} online orders, meaning that shipping charges <b>are</b> now <b>taxed.</b> Food, periodicals, and prescription drugs <b>are</b> not <b>taxed.</b> Food served in restaurants and other 'prepared food' <b>is</b> <b>taxed</b> at the general sales tax rate.|$|R

25|$|A tax {{effectively}} changes relative {{prices of}} products. Therefore, most economists, especially neoclassical economists, argue that taxation creates market distortion {{and results in}} economic inefficiency unless there are (positive or negative) externalities associated with the activities that <b>are</b> <b>taxed</b> {{that need to be}} internalized to reach an efficient market outcome. They have therefore sought to identify the kind of tax system that would minimize this distortion.|$|E
25|$|A {{proportional}} or {{progressive tax}} is levied by the Confederation (at a flat rate of 8.5%) and the cantons (at varying rates) on corporate profits. The tax {{is based on}} the net profit as accounted for in the corporate income statement, as adjusted for tax purposes. For instance, expenditures that have no business reason such as excessive depreciations, accruals or reserves, as well as disguised dividends <b>are</b> <b>taxed</b> as profits.|$|E
25|$|An {{income tax}} {{is a tax}} imposed on {{individuals}} or entities (taxpayers) that varies with their respective income or profits (taxable income). Many jurisdictions refer to income tax on business entities as companies tax or corporate tax. Partnerships generally are not taxed; rather, the partners <b>are</b> <b>taxed</b> on their share of partnership items. Tax may be imposed by both a country and subdivisions. Most jurisdictions exempt locally organized charitable organizations from tax.|$|E

50|$|One {{reason that}} the {{recipient}} of a bequest <b>is</b> usually not <b>taxed</b> on the bequest is because the donor may <b>be</b> <b>taxed</b> on it.

Citizens <b>are</b> <b>taxed</b> within five income brackets, which range from 3.0 percent to 6.5 percent. The state's consumer sales tax is levied at 6 percent. Effective January 1, 2004, calculation of WV consumer sales tax has been converted to a calculated figure from the bracket system, and remains at 6 percent for most goods (non-prepared foods are not taxed).|$|E
25|$|Taxable {{income of}} taxpayers {{resident}} in the jurisdiction is generally total income less income producing expenses and other deductions. Generally, only net gain from sale of property, including goods held for sale, {{is included in}} income. Income of a corporation's shareholders usually includes distributions of profits from the corporation. Deductions typically include all income producing or business expenses including an allowance for recovery of costs of business assets. Many jurisdictions allow notional deductions for individuals, and may allow deduction of some personal expenses. Most jurisdictions either do not tax income earned outside the jurisdiction or allow a credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions on such income. Nonresidents <b>are</b> <b>taxed</b> only on certain types of income from sources within the jurisdictions, with few exceptions.|$|E

Generally, persons paying salaries or wages or other emoluments must withhold tax from remuneration paid to employees (PAYE). Every individual {{between the ages of}} 16 and 65, who is employed in Barbados must be insured under the National Insurance and Social Security Act and contributions are determined as a percentage of insurable earnings up to a maximum of $4,090 per month or $944 per week up to 13.5% (6.5% from employee and 6.5% from employer).|$|E

40|$|The current tax {{treatment}} of pensions {{and health insurance}} in the United States is a hybrid that lacks consistency under either an accrual income tax system or a consumption tax system. Under an accrual income tax, employer contributions to pension plans represent an addition to wealth that would <b>be</b> <b>taxed</b> {{at the time they}} are made. The interest earned on pension contributions also represents an addition to wealth that would <b>be</b> <b>taxed</b> annually. When a worker retires, all applicable taxes would already have been paid on the benefit, and the flow of retirement income received by the worker would not <b>be</b> <b>taxed.</b> Similarly, employer-provided health insurance arguably represents a current benefit that, under the income <b>tax,</b> should <b>be</b> <b>taxed</b> annually as current income. 1 Under a consumption <b>tax,</b> things <b>are</b> different for pensions.

25|$|And so {{with the}} Southern States, towards the Northern States, in the vital matter of taxation. They are in a {{minority}} in Congress. Their representation in Congress, is useless to protect them against unjust taxation; and they <b>are</b> <b>taxed</b> {{by the people of}} the North for their benefit, exactly as the people of Great Britain taxed our ancestors in the British parliament for their benefit. For the last forty years, the taxes laid by the Congress of the United States have been laid with a view of subserving the interests of the North. The people of the South have been taxed by duties on imports, not for revenue, but for an object inconsistent with revenue to promote, by prohibitions, Northern interests in the productions of their mines and manufactures.|$|E
25|$|Kentucky has {{a broadly}} based {{classified}} property tax system. All classes of property, unless exempted by the Constitution, <b>are</b> <b>taxed</b> by the state, although at widely varying rates.

Of the classes that {{are subject to}} local taxation, three have special rates set by the General Assembly, one by the Kentucky Supreme Court and the remaining classes {{are subject to the}} full local rate, which includes the tax rate set by the local taxing bodies plus all voted levies. Real property is assessed on 100% of the fair market value and property taxes are due by December 31. Once the primary source of state and local government revenue, property taxes now account for only about 6% of the Kentucky's annual General Fund revenues.|$|E
25|$|Most jurisdictions {{imposing}} {{an income}} tax treat capital gains as part of income subject to tax. Capital gain is generally a gain on sale of capital assets—that is, those assets not held {{for sale in the}} ordinary course of business. Capital assets include personal assets in many jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions provide preferential rates of tax or only partial taxation for capital gains. Some jurisdictions impose different rates or levels of capital gains taxation based on the length of time the asset was held. Because tax rates are often much lower for capital gains than for ordinary income, there is widespread controversy and dispute about the proper definition of capital. Some tax scholars have argued that differences in the ways different kinds of capital and investment <b>are</b> <b>taxed</b> contribute to economic distortions.|$|E
