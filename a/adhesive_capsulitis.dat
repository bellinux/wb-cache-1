2500|$|As {{the name}} implies, {{movement}} of the shoulder is severely restricted in people with a [...] "frozen shoulder". This condition, which doctors call <b>adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis,</b> is frequently caused by injury that leads to lack of use due to pain.

40|$|Background Optimal {{management}} for <b>adhesive</b> shoulder <b>capsulitis</b> (frozen shoulder) is currently unclear. We intended to explore whether treatment by intra-articular injections with corticosteroid and distension {{is more effective}} than treating with corticosteroids alone or treatment-as-usual in a primary care setting in Norway. Methods In this prospective randomised intention to treat parallel study, 106 patients were block randomised to three groups; 36 (analysed 35) receiving steroid injection and Lidocaine (IS), 34 receiving steroid and additional saline as distension (ISD) and 36 had treatment-as-usual (TAU). Intervention groups received four injections within 8 weeks, assessed on 1 st visit, at the 4 th and 8 th week. Outcomes were Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), Numerical pain rating scale (NPRS) and passive range of motion (PROM). Postal assessment was repeated after 1 year for SPADI. Patients in the IS and ISD groups were “blinded” for intervention received and the assessor was “blinded” to group allocation. Results At baseline there were no differences between groups in outcome measures. There were no statistical significant differences between the intervention groups in SPADI, NPRS and PROM at baseline, at short-term (4 -and 8 weeks) or long-term (12 months). There were statistically significant differences (p[*] [*] 0. 05). Effect size (ES) at 8 weeks was large between both injection groups and TAU (ES 1. 2). At 12 months ES was reduced to 0. 3 and 0. 4 respectively. Transitory side effects as flushing and after-pain were reported by 14 % in intervention groups. Conclusion This intention to treat RCT in primary care indicates that four injections with corticosteroid with or without distension, given with increasing intervals during 8 weeks, were better than treatment-as-usual in treatment of <b>adhesive</b> shoulder <b>capsulitis.</b> However, in the long run no difference was found between any of the groups, indicating that natural healing takes place independent of treatment or not.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{shoulder}} manipulation and arthroscopic arthrolysis with glenohumeral steroid injections in patients affected by idiopathic <b>adhesive</b> shoulder <b>capsulitis.</b> In this prospective study we randomly assigned patients to enter group A (23 patients, shoulder manipulation and arthroscopic arthrolysis) and group B (21 patients, glenohumeral steroid injections). Patients were followed-up at three, six and 12 weeks, and at six and 12 months with the Constant and Murley, ASES, UCLA and SST evaluation scales. Moreover, passive forward flexion, abduction, and internal and external rotations were recorded. Range of motion showed satisfactory results in both groups at final follow-up: in group A the mean ABD increased from 60 A degrees to 154 A degrees, ER from 20 A degrees to 40 A degrees, and FF from 75 A degrees to 174 A degrees; in group B, ABD raised from 76 A degrees to 145 A degrees, ER from 20 A degrees to 35 A degrees, and FF from 115 A degrees to 164 A degrees. All the evaluation scales performed increased significantly at final follow-up in both groups. However, while patients of group A had already reached significant improvement at the six-week follow-up (p < 0. 03), in group B this happened only at the 12 week follow-up (p < 0. 03). Both types of treatment were effective in improving final range of motion; however, while patients of group A accomplished their goal by the six-week follow-up, in group B the same result was obtained at the 12 -week follow-up...|$|R

50|$|Imaging {{features}} of <b>adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis</b> are seen on non-contrast MRI, though MR arthrography and invasive arthroscopy are more accurate in diagnosis. Ultrasound and MRI {{can help in}} diagnosis by assessing the coracohumeral ligament, with a width of greater than 3 mm being 60% sensitive and 95% specific for the diagnosis. The condition can also be associated with edema or fluid at the rotator interval, a space in the shoulder joint normally containing fat between the supraspinatus and subscapularis tendons, medial to the rotator cuff. Shoulders with <b>adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis</b> also characteristically fibrose and thicken at the axillary pouch and rotator interval, best seen as dark signal on T1 sequences with edema and inflammation on T2 sequences. A finding on ultrasound associated with <b>adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis</b> is hypoechoic material surrounding the long head of the biceps tendon at the rotator interval, reflecting fibrosis. In the painful stage, such hypoechoic material may demonstrate increased vascularity with Doppler ultrasound.|$|E
50|$|People {{who suffer}} from <b>adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis</b> usually {{experience}} severe pain and sleep deprivation for prolonged periods due to pain that gets worse when lying still and restricted movement/positions.

People {{who suffer from}} <b>adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis</b> may have extreme difficulty concentrating, working, or performing daily life activities for extended periods of time. The condition tends to be self-limiting and usually resolves over time without surgery. Most people regain about 90% of shoulder motion over time.|$|E

50|$|The {{procedure}} is performed under imaging guidance, using either fluoroscopy, ultrasound or Computed Tomography (CT).

50|$|People with diabetes, stroke, lung disease, {{rheumatoid}} arthritis, {{or heart}} disease {{are at a}} higher risk for frozen shoulder.

50|$|Hydrodilatation or {{hydraulic}} arthrographic capsular distension or distension arthrography is {{a medical}} treatment for <b>adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis</b> of shoulder. The treatment is applied by a radiologist assisted by a radiographer. Contrast medium, a local anaesthetic and cortisone are injected into the joint. Then up to 40ml of sterile saline solution are injected, using X-ray as guidance, to stretch the joint capsule. Risk of complications is low. Whether the treatment is successful is known {{after a couple of}} weeks.|$|E
50|$|The {{incidence}} of <b>adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis</b> is approximately 3 {{percent in the}} general population. Occurrence is rare in children and people under 40 but peaks between 40 and 70 years of age. At least in its idiopathic form, the condition is much more common in women than in men (70% of patients are women aged 40 - 60).

50|$|The rotator {{interval}} is {{a triangular}} {{space in the}} shoulder that is functionally reinforced externally by the coracohumeral ligament and internally by the superior glenohumeral ligament, and traversed by the intra-articular biceps tendon.

Changes of <b>adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis</b> can be seen at this interval as edema and fibrosis. Pathology at the interval is also associated with glenohumeral and biceps instability.|$|E
50|$|<b>Adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis</b> (also {{known as}} frozen shoulder) is a painful and {{disabling}} disorder of unclear cause {{in which the}} shoulder capsule, the connective tissue surrounding the glenohumeral joint of the shoulder, becomes inflamed and stiff, greatly restricting motion and causing chronic pain. Pain is usually constant, worse at night, and with cold weather. Certain movements or bumps can provoke episodes of tremendous pain and cramping. The condition {{is thought to be}} caused by injury or trauma to the area and may have an autoimmune component.|$|E
50|$|People {{with severe}} {{involvement}} often show lumps {{on the back}} of their finger joints (called “Garrod's pads”, “knuckle pads”, or “dorsal Dupuytren nodules”) and lumps in the arch of the feet (plantar fibromatosis or Ledderhose disease). In severe cases, the area where the palm meets the wrist may develop lumps. Severe Dupuytren disease may also be associated with frozen shoulder (<b>adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis</b> of shoulder), Peyronie's disease of the penis, increased risk of several types of cancer, and risk of early death, but {{more research is needed to}} clarify these relationships.|$|E
50|$|In frozen shoulder, {{there is}} a lack of {{synovial}} fluid, which normally helps the shoulder joint, a ball and socket joint, move by lubricating the gap between the humerus (upper arm bone) and the socket in the shoulder blade. The shoulder capsule thickens, swells, and tightens due to bands of scar tissue (adhesions) that have formed inside the capsule. As a result, there is less room in the joint for the humerus, making movement of the shoulder stiff and painful. This restricted space between the capsule and ball of the humerus distinguishes <b>adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis</b> from a less complicated, painful, stiff shoulder.|$|E
50|$|Musculoskeletal {{ultrasound}} {{has been}} advocated by experienced practitioners, avoiding the radiation of X-ray and {{the expense of}} MRI while demonstrating comparable accuracy to MRI for identifying and measuring the size of full-thickness and partial-thickness rotator cuff tears.

50|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to distinguish between pain caused by bursitis or that caused by a rotator cuff injury as both exhibit similar pain patterns in the front or side of the shoulder (Hartley, 1990). Subacromial bursitis can be painful with resisted abduction due to the pinching of the bursa as the deltoid contracts (Buschbacher & Braddom, 1994). If the therapist performs a treatment direction test and gently applies joint traction or a caudal glide during abduction (MWM), the painful arc may reduce if the problem is bursitis or <b>adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis</b> (as this potentially increases the subacromial space).|$|E

50|$|In 1997 Morrison et al.published a {{study that}} {{reviewed}} the cases of 616 patients (636 shoulders) with impingement syndrome (painful arc of motion) to assess the outcome of non-surgical care. An {{attempt was made to}} exclude patients who were suspected of having additional shoulder conditions such as, full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff, degenerative arthritis of the acromioclavicular joint, instability of the glenohumeral joint, or <b>adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis.</b> All patients were managed with anti-inflammatory medication and a specific, supervised physical-therapy regimen. The patients were followed up from six months to over six years.

50|$|<b>Adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis</b> {{or frozen}} {{shoulder}} syndrome {{is a common}} shoulder capsule pathology that results when injury, surgery, or other chronic health conditions such as diabetes and arthritis damage or loosen the shoulder joint. As {{a result of the}} damage, the shoulder capsule becomes inflamed and taut, leading to stiffness, pain, and limited range of motion in the shoulder area. Range of motion can usually be restored by treating the affected area with heat and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in addition to light stretching and or a disciplined physical therapy program. In extreme cases where medication and physical therapy prove to be ineffective in treating the condition, arthroscopic surgery (known as Arthroscopic Capsular Release) can be performed to loosen the capsule by removing regions of thickened scar tissue within and around the shoulder joint.|$|E
40|$|<b>Adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis</b> is, in most cases, a {{self-limiting}} condition of poorly understood etiology {{that results in}} shoulder pain and large mobility deficits. The socio-economic burden will increase as with continuous aging of our population. In addition, both prevalence and incidence figures of <b>adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis</b> are increasing. No literature overview solely focuses on the physiotherapeutic options in patients with <b>adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis</b> and their scientific evidence. Moreover, although some physiotherapeutic interventions show evidence regarding reducing pain or increasing mobility, {{there is little evidence}} to suggest that the disease prognosis is affected and this raises the need for new, innovative {{research in the area of}} <b>adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis</b> and its treatment. By presenting its current evidence, we hope to retrieve several gaps in the present management of <b>adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis</b> by physiotherapists and provide us with new insights for improving the physiotherapists' policy in treating <b>adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis</b> patients, e. g., continuously increasing nociceptive impulse activity, as in early stages of <b>adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis,</b> could lead to peripheral and subsequently long-lasting central sensitization, as well as to an increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system. But up to now the involvement of central sensitization in <b>adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis</b> has not been studied yet and remains speculative. Finally, when selecting a physical treatment method for <b>adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis,</b> it is extremely important to consider the patient's symptoms, stage of the condition, and recognition of different patterns of motion loss.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{evaluated}} mRNA expression {{levels of}} genes that encode TGF-&# 946; 1; the TGF-&# 946; 1 receptor; the collagen-modifying enzymes LOX, PLOD 1, and PLOD 2; and the extracellular matrix proteins COMP, FN 1, TNC and TNXB in synovial/capsule specimens from patients with idiopathic <b>adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis.</b> Possible associations between the measured mRNA levels and clinical parameters were also investigated. METHODS: We obtained glenohumeral joint synovium/capsule specimens from 9 patients with idiopathic <b>adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis</b> {{who had not}} shown improvement in symptoms after 5 months of physiotherapy. <b>Adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis</b> was confirmed in all patients by magnetic resonance imaging. We also obtained specimens from 8 control patients who had underwent surgery for acute acromioclavicular joint dislocation and who had radiological indication of glenohumeral capsule alteration based on arthroscopic evaluation. mRNA expression in the synovium/capsule specimens was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. The B 2 M and HPRT 1 genes were used as references to normalize target gene expression in the shoulder tissue samples. RESULTS: The synovium/capsule samples from the patients with <b>adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis</b> had significantly higher TNC and FN 1 expression than those from the controls. Additionally, symptom duration directly correlated with expression of TGF&# 946; 1 receptor I. CONCLUSION: Elevated levels of TNC and FN 1 expression may be a marker of capsule injury. Upregulation of TGF&# 946; 1 receptor I seems {{to be dependent on}} symptom duration; therefore, TGF&# 946; signaling may be involved in <b>adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis.</b> As such, TNC, FN 1 and TGF&# 946; 1 receptor I may also play roles in <b>adhesive</b> <b>capsulitis</b> by contributing to capsule inflammation and fibrosis...|$|E
