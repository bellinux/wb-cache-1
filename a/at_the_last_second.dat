5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} that crossing the Void causes a traveller to become saturated in Void material. If {{he opens the}} breach and reverses it, anything saturated in Void material will be pulled in. Everyone except Jackie has crossed the breach and is thus vulnerable to being trapped in the Void, so the Doctor sends them all to the parallel universe.

These additional sources of radar data allowed North Vietnam to turn on SAM radar <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>second,</b> giving US aircrews virtually no warning.|$|E
