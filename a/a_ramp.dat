5|$|Route 87 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with U.S. Route 30 in Atlantic City, {{heading to the}} northeast on Huron Avenue, an undivided road with two northbound lanes and three southbound lanes. Immediately after beginning, it passes under the Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector and comes to <b>a</b> <b>ramp</b> that provides access from southbound Route 87 to the southbound connector. From here, the route widens to seven lanes, with two northbound lanes and five southbound lanes. It passes by the Borgata casino, with <b>a</b> <b>ramp</b> from the casino to the northbound direction. The road becomes a four-lane divided highway and passes under <b>a</b> <b>ramp</b> from the Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector to the Borgata before heading under northbound direction of the connector. Here, <b>a</b> <b>ramp</b> from the connector provides access to Route 87. A short distance later, the route comes to the northern terminus of Route 187 and turns north to follow Brigantine Boulevard, which is a four-lane divided highway.|$|E

5|$|MD 177 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MD 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway) in Pasadena {{just north of}} MD 2's interchange with MD 100 (Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway). The state highway heads east as a six-lane divided highway which drops to four lanes at its intersection with <b>a</b> <b>ramp</b> from southbound MD 10 (Arundel Expressway) and ramps to and from westbound MD 100. MD 177 passes under MD 10, spawns <b>a</b> <b>ramp</b> onto northbound MD 10, and meets {{the southern end of}} MD 648 (BaltimoreAnnapolis Boulevard) at Lipin's Corner. At the next intersection, unsigned MD 915 (Long Hill Road) splits to the south. MD 177 continues east as a two-lane road that regularly gains a center turn lane. The state highway intersects another section of MD 648 (Waterford Road), Catherine Avenue, and Edwin Raynor Boulevard on its way to Jacobsville. In the center of Jacobsville, MD 177 intersects MD 607, which heads south as Magothy Bridge Road and north as Hog Neck Road.|$|E

5|$|The route {{passes to}} the west of the Golden Nugget casino and comes to <b>a</b> <b>ramp</b> that {{provides}} access from northbound Route 87 to both the Trump Marina and Harrah's Atlantic City casinos before passing under the northbound Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector again. Immediately after, the route has <b>a</b> <b>ramp</b> from the southbound direction that provides access to the connector and westbound U.S. Route 30. The northbound Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector parallels Route 87 to the east as it turns northeast and comes to a right-in/right-out in the southbound direction that serves both Harrah's and Borgata. From here, the route passes to the southeast of Harrah's. The northbound Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector merges onto northbound Route 87 before the route comes to <b>a</b> <b>ramp</b> that provides access to the northbound direction of the route from Harrah's. Past here, the route crosses over the Absecon Channel on the Justice Vincent S. Haneman Memorial Bridge and runs along the border of Atlantic City to the northwest and Brigantine to the southeast.

30|$|The {{temperature}} of the experiments was varied between 400 and 500  °C. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) was changed from 1 to 3  h− 1, designated as WHSV 1, WHSV 2 and WHSV 3 for 1  h− 1, 2  h− 1 and 3  h− 1, respectively. The reaction products were condensed using a cooler at − 10  °C. The reactants and products were analyzed using a Thermo Finnegan DSQ 250 GC–MS (gas chromatography–mass spectrometry) with a ZB- 1 MS capillary column (60  m, 0.25  mm internal diameter, 0.25 film thickness). The temperature for the injection, MS transfer line and ion source were kept at 280, 300 and 230  °C, respectively. DMN isomers in the products can be easily separated using a column temperature programmer. First, it was heated from 95 to 125  °C with <b>a</b> <b>ramping</b> of 1  °C/min, and then from 125 to 200  °C with <b>a</b> <b>ramping</b> of 5  °C/min and finally from 200 to 230  °C with <b>a</b> <b>ramping</b> of 20  °C/min with a He flow rate of 0.7  mL/min as carrier gas.|$|R

5|$|After {{unsuccessful}} litigation to {{stop the}} project, the Big Four Bridge was converted into a pedestrian and bicycle bridge as part of Louisville Waterfront Park and the ongoing revitalization of the Louisville riverfront. This conversion had been proposed and planned since the 1990s. The Indiana Department of Transportation pledged $1million for the project to build <b>a</b> <b>ramp</b> to the Big Four Bridge on the Indiana side, on Riverside Drive, and Jeffersonville pledged $200,000; early estimates were that the Indiana ramp would cost $2.8million, but was likely to increase. The Kentucky ramp was expected to cost $4million; the ramp foundation is already done. Fixing the Big Four Bridge was expected to cost $3million and take 18months. The only other facility still standing that was owned by the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway is the Spring Street Freight House. However, the mayor of Jeffersonville, Tom Galligan, called for a redesign of the entrance ramp to the bridge on the Indiana side, stressing that the proposed ramp would be unattractive and that {{the building of the}} column on a flood plain would probably not be possible. Galligan pointed out that neither the United States Coast Guard nor the Army Corps of Engineers had approved of the planned rampway. Galligan said he would rather have <b>a</b> <b>ramp</b> that reached over the floodwall and ended on Mulberry Street, causing a less severe incline on and off the bridge. Previous plans to access the Big Four Bridge included building an elevator.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{suggested}} that the barrow was constructed before the chamber, {{and that it was}} used as <b>a</b> <b>ramp</b> on which to drag the large stones into position. He {{suggested that}} these megaliths were covered with sand until the capstones were placed atop the chamber, at which the sand was then cleared. In 1950, it was stated that fourteen of the stones currently survive, although following full excavation it was revealed that eighteen large sarsen boulders were extant, alongside four smaller sarsen stones used in the drystone wall and pavement of the tomb.|$|E
5|$|Eastbound SR56 {{begins as}} <b>a</b> <b>ramp</b> from the {{northbound}} I-5's local bypass lanes. The interchange is not complete; southbound I-5 traffic must exit to Carmel Valley Road before entering SR56. Westbound traffic on SR56 merges into the southbound I-5 local bypass lanes, which {{provide access to}} I-805. Continuing east, the route then has a diamond interchange at Carmel Creek Road, which provides access to the nearby San Diego Jewish Academy, and proceeds eastward through a residential area. After passing milepost 2, the freeway has another diamond interchange with Carmel Country Road south {{of the community of}} Torrey Hills.|$|E

5|$|In February 2011, Kentucky and Indiana {{announced}} that the two states, along with the City of Jeffersonville, would allocate $22 million in funding to complete the Big Four Bridge project, creating a pedestrian and bicycle path to link Louisville and Jeffersonville. Indiana would spend up to $8 million and the City of Jeffersonville would provide $2 million in matching dollars to pay for construction of <b>a</b> <b>ramp</b> to the Big Four Bridge. Kentucky pledged $12 million to replace the deck on the bridge and connect it to the spiral ramp that was completed in Waterfront Park.|$|E
5|$|NY111 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY27A (Main Street) {{in the town}} of Islip.

NY111 soon crosses the nearby Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road just east of the Islip station, from where it continues north past various businesses and residences. As the road heads northward, it intersects with Bittermint Street, a connector to NY27 (Sunrise Highway) eastbound. After crossing over NY27, the route intersects with <b>a</b> <b>ramp</b> serving the westbound lanes and Islip Boulevard, which connects NY27 westbound to NY111.|$|E
5|$|PA378 heads northward {{across the}} Hill to Hill Bridge, {{at which point}} it crosses back into Lehigh County.

The highway continues northward through the city, crossing under West Broad Street and reaching a southbound interchange with North Street, which leads to Center City and Third Avenue. The freeway continues northward, crossing over and receiving an on-ramp from Union Boulevard.|$|E
