5|$|A Polish Nobleman is a 1637 {{painting}} by Rembrandt depicting {{a man in}} a costume of either Polish szlachta or boyar nobility. The identity of the subject of the painting is unclear, and has given rise to several different interpretations. The view that the figure's dress is clearly Polish is not universally held <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have been a self-portrait.|$|E
5|$|Avocado cheesecake is a {{style of}} cheesecake {{prepared}} using avocado as a main ingredient.

5|$|It may be {{possible}} to embolize vascular lesions through interventional radiology; this requires passing a catheter through a large artery and locating the maxillary artery under X-ray guidance, followed by the injection into the vessel of particles that occlude the blood vessels.

5|$|Naked {{extracellular}} DNA (eDNA), {{most of it}} {{released by}} cell death, is nearly ubiquitous in the environment. Its concentration in soil may {{be as high as}} 2 μg/L, and its concentration in natural aquatic environments may be as high at 88 μg/L. Various possible functions have been proposed for eDNA: it may be involved in horizontal gene transfer; it may provide nutrients; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> act as a buffer to recruit or titrate ions or antibiotics. Extracellular DNA acts as a functional extracellular matrix component in the biofilms of several bacterial species. It may act as a recognition factor to regulate the attachment and dispersal of specific cell types in the biofilm; it may contribute to biofilm formation; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> contribute to the biofilm's physical strength and resistance to biological stress.|$|E

5|$|Orcadian {{folklore}} had {{a strong}} Scandinavian influence, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be that the nuckelavee is a composite of a water horse from Celtic mythology and a creature imported by the Norsemen.

5|$|The {{range of}} the golden white-eye has {{contracted}} considerably since the arrival of humans in the Mariana Islands.

5|$|This {{species is}} mainly diurnal, {{especially}} {{in the north of}} its range. Further south it is said to be active in the evening, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> even be active at night during the summer months.

5|$|A harbour {{was built}} {{south-east}} of the castle, which would originally {{have been used}} to receive first building materials, then later senior members of the castle household or important guests. All that remains of the harbour is its 246-foot (75 m) quay, built from basalt boulders, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> not have been in frequent use during the medieval period, since it could only have been safely used during periods of good weather. West of the castle is a later shieling, the earthwork remains of a longhouse. South of this is a rectangular earthwork, with walls over 3-foot 3 inches (1 m) high, which may have been a siege fortification from 1462. If this is in fact such a siege-work, it would be a unique survival in England from this period.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{thorn in}} the side of the Scottish Crown at the turn of the thirteenth century was Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness (died 1206). At some point in the last half of the twelfth century, Haraldr put aside his first wife, a daughter of an Earl of Fife, and married Hvarflǫð, a daughter of an Earl of Ross. The latter woman was a member of the powerful meic Áedha, a northern kindred who had been in open conflict with the Scottish Crown throughout the twelfth century. Previous Orcadian earls had extended influence into Ross, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> well have been through Hvarflǫð, and the claims to the earldom that she passed to their children, that drew Haraldr into conflict with the Scots.|$|E
5|$|Aesthetics as {{a factor}} of well-being. From the early austere {{principle}} that form should strictly follow function, {{there is a growing}} sensibility that aesthetics affect the physical and emotional health of those who use a building or structure. Norwegian laws concerning occupational health have for several decades emphasized access to daylight and fresh air, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> also be that harsh climatic conditions create an added imperative for uplifting aesthetics.|$|E

5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion, U.S. General William Westmoreland {{concluded}} that the Viet Cong still had the strength to continue the attacks on Đồng Xoài. In contrast, South Vietnamese forces within the vicinity of Đồng Xoài were severely depleted, and did not have sufficient strength to defeat the Viet Cong. Furthermore, there was only one remaining battalion in South Vietnam’s strategic reserve, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> not be enough to drive the Communist out from the area if it was committed.|$|E
5|$|Although plague was known, it {{was still}} {{sufficiently}} uncommon that medical practitioners might have had no personal experience of seeing the disease; medical training varied from those who had attended the college of physicians, to apothecaries who also acted as modern doctors, to simple charlatans. Other diseases abounded, such as an outbreak of smallpox the year before, and these uncertainties all added to difficulties identifying the true start of the epidemic. Contemporary accounts suggest cases of plague occurred through the winter of 1664/5, {{some of which were}} fatal but a number of which did not display the virulence of the later epidemic. The winter was cold, the ground frozen from December to March, river traffic on the Thames twice blocked by ice, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be that the cold weather held back its spread.|$|E
