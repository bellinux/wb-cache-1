5|$|Academic {{standards}} and enrollment numbers at the Baltimore City College (B.C.C.) after reaching {{a high of}} near 4,000 boys by the mid-1960s went {{through a period of}} decline first in the late 1960s to mid 1970s, with the rapid opening of newer additional high schools both in the outreaches of the city along with the rapidly expanding suburbs in surrounding Baltimore County. Two in the city system were Northwestern in 1965 and Northern in the following year. Three high schools were completed and opened all at one time in September 1971, with Southwestern, Walbrook and a massive huge complex nearby to City in Clifton Park on the bed of the old reservoir off Harford Road, Lake Clifton. The 'A' and 'B' courses were slowly dying out <b>and</b> <b>unfortunately</b> discontinued by 1973, and a single academic track was offered.|$|E

25|$|As is, of most sports, {{the success}} of the club is gauged on the top team <b>and</b> <b>unfortunately</b> due to a restructure by the ACA the Premier Team was relegated in early 2000s to a new grade called 1st grade with {{promotion}} relegation.

25|$|The Victoria Aristocrats of the PCHA next {{challenged}} the Bulldogs. The powerhouse Bulldogs expected to bowl over the Aristocrats, but were shocked after splitting {{the first two}} games and then losing 6–1 in the decisive third game. Fortunately for Quebec, <b>and</b> <b>unfortunately</b> for Victoria, the Stanley Cup Board of trustees did not recognise the challenge because it should have been played in Quebec. PCHA leader Lester Patrick refused. The Bulldogs were able to keep the Cup.|$|E

This meeting was fortuitous for all, as the band had already booked a venue for a dance night in two weeks time <b>and</b> <b>unfortunately</b> their then singer {{had turned out to}} be somewhat average and had departed the scene. Band practice with Richards started the very next night, he did not disappoint.|$|E

25|$|Apart from a brief {{mention in}} an {{event at the}} Gymnasium in February 1873, John Hulley faded from the public {{spotlight}} after being in its glare for over 12 years. Later reports talk about a trip to North America; he also wintered on the continent to avoid {{the worst of the}} English weather but remained in Liverpool throughout the winter of 1874–75 <b>and</b> <b>unfortunately</b> encountered severe weather. This proved fatal and he died on 6 January 1875 at 91 Grove Street, Liverpool, aged 42. He was survived by his wife Georgiana and daughter Georgiana Theodosis.|$|E

25|$|Practical {{surgical}} procedures used for treating synkinesis are neurolysis and selective myectomy. Neurolysis {{has been shown}} to be effective in relieving synkinesis but only temporarily <b>and</b> <b>unfortunately</b> symptoms return much worse than originally. Selective myectomy, in which a synkinetic muscle is selectively resected, is a much more effective technique that can provide permanent relief and results in a low recurrence rate; unfortunately, it also has many post-operative complications that can accompany including edema, hematoma, and ecchymosis. Therefore, {{surgical procedures}} are very minimally used by doctors and are used only as last-resort options for patients who do not respond well to non-invasive treatments.|$|E
25|$|In October 1911, Knox {{attempted}} {{to rejoin the}} army and applied {{to the office of}} the surgeon general for readmission. His application was received in 1912, <b>and</b> <b>unfortunately</b> his application was not well received. Although it is not clear precisely why Knox fell out of favor of the army, there are several possibilities. It is possible that his discovery and reported treatment of rampant venereal disease while at Fort Hancock was frowned upon, as at the time venereal disease was quite stigmatizing and his treatment of it might have been considered immoral. It is also possible that the rapid dissolution of his marriage to Marion, and quick remarriage to Gladys, painted him as an unreliable man. In any case, he was not permitted readmission to the army.|$|E
25|$|In 1919 Huxley married Juliette Baillot (1896–1994). She was a French Swiss girl {{whom he had}} met at Garsington Manor, {{the country}} house of Lady Ottoline Morrell, a Bloomsbury Group socialite {{with a penchant for}} artists and intellectuals. The newly-weds' life {{together}} included students, faculty wives, grebes <b>and,</b> <b>unfortunately,</b> another depressive breakdown, this time rather serious. From his wife's autobiography it seems his mental illness took the form of a bipolar disorder, with the depressive phases being of moderate to severe intensity. It took a long time for him to recover on this occasion, but despite this he left a legacy of students who admired him, and who became leaders in zoology for the next thirty or forty years. E. B. Ford always remembered his openness and encouragement at the start of his career.|$|E

25|$|One {{area where}} data access {{is likely to}} be {{difficult}} is flows from the technosphere. The technosphere is more simply defined as the man-made world. Considered by geologists as secondary resources, these resources are in theory 100% recyclable; however, in a practical sense, the primary goal is salvage. For an LCI, these technosphere products (supply chain products) are those that have been produced by man <b>and</b> <b>unfortunately</b> those completing a questionnaire about a process which uses a man-made product as {{a means to an end}} will be unable to specify how much of a given input they use. Typically, they will not have access to data concerning inputs and outputs for previous production processes of the product. The entity undertaking the LCA must then turn to secondary sources if it does not already have that data from its own previous studies. National databases or data sets that come with LCA-practitioner tools, or that can be readily accessed, are the usual sources for that information. Care must then be taken to ensure that the secondary data source properly reflects regional or national conditions.|$|E
25|$|Only {{several hundred}} yards from the site of the Merry Maidens lies a Bronze age burial chamber, Cruk Tregyffian, that was {{discovered}} (<b>and</b> <b>unfortunately</b> damaged) during widening of the adjacent B3315 road. The circular barrow is composed of stone uprights decorated with cupmarks, dry stone walling and four capstones. Although the original decorated stone has been removed to Truro museum to protect it against weathering, a replica now sits in its place. Further east along the B3315 road, and only a mile from Lamorna, lies the Boleigh Fogou, considered {{to be one of the}} best remaining monuments of its kind in Cornwall. Built in the Iron age, the purpose of fogous (derived from the Cornish word for cave) is not known. It has been speculated, however, that they could have been used for food storage or for religious ceremonies. The fogou at Boleigh is extensive and has a large entranceway that leads to a long passage with classic dry stone wall and lintel construction. A low doorway just inside the entrance leads to a much narrower and lower passage that turns ninety degrees left after a few metres. After the turn the passage continues for a metre or two before ending; there is a modern metal support grille set into the roof above this section.|$|E
25|$|Dear Princess, as I {{have already}} cabled you, I granted leave to Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, <b>and</b> <b>unfortunately</b> I must again repeat that I am {{extremely}} dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply {{does not want to}} do anything at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, who do {{not know what to do}} with him. Today I gave him a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am writing you all this, because I am afraid that Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he would do better to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to write you all this, but what can I do. I send you my best wishes for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E
