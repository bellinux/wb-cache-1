5|$|The fair catch kick is a rule at the {{professional}} and high school levels of American football that allows <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> just made a fair catch to attempt a free kick from the spot of the catch. The kick must be either a place kick or a drop kick, and if it passes over the crossbar and between the goalposts of the defensive team's goal, a field goal, worth three points, is scored to the offensive team.|$|E
5|$|Krichell is {{considered}} one of the greatest scouts in baseball history. Birdie Tebbetts, a member of the Veterans Committee in the 1980s, led a campaign to have Krichell, along with fellow scouts Charlie Barrett and Hugh Alexander, inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Under Hall of Fame rules, scouts are not eligible for induction. Tibbets appealed to the Hall of Fame Board of Directors every year from 1981 to 1986 to make the three scouts members of the Hall of Fame, but with no success. In The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, James awards the Paul Krichell Talent Scout Award to an example of <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> a good chance of signing a player who later becomes a star, who they end up passing on as the result of poor scouting.|$|E
5|$|Many of the pre-game and in-game {{strategic}} {{decisions in}} baseball revolve around a fundamental fact: in general, right-handed batters {{tend to be}} more successful against left-handed pitchers and, to an even greater degree, left-handed batters {{tend to be more}} successful against right-handed pitchers. A manager with several left-handed batters in the regular lineup who knows the team will be facing a left-handed starting pitcher may respond by starting {{one or more of the}} right-handed backups on the team's roster. During the late innings of a game, as relief pitchers and pinch hitters are brought in, the opposing managers will often go back and forth trying to create favorable matchups with their substitutions: the manager of the fielding team trying to arrange same-handed pitcher-batter matchups, the manager of the batting team trying to arrange opposite-handed matchups. With <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> the lead in the late innings, a manager may remove a starting position player—especially one whose turn at bat is not likely to come up again—for a more skillful fielder. Furthermore, unlike players in most team sports, baseball players can not return to a game after being replaced; this creates a greater risk when making lineup changes, especially as a team's pitching staff may be increasingly depleted in the late innings of a game, particularly one which goes into multiple extra innings.|$|E

25|$|If <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> been penalised commits another offence (often dissent {{against the}} referee's decision), the referee may advance the {{position}} of the penalty 10 metres towards the offending team's goal line, and may also sin bin (temporary expulsion) or send off (permanent expulsion) the offending player(s).|$|E
25|$|A {{standard}} match {{consists of}} two equal periods of 20 minutes. The length of either half is extended to allow penalty kicks to be taken or a direct free kick to be taken against <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> committed more than five fouls. The interval between the two halves cannot exceed 15 minutes.|$|E
25|$|A team cannot {{use this}} {{exception}} in consecutive years; {{a team that}} used it in 2016–17 (under the 2011 CBA) cannot use it in 2017–18 (under the 2017 CBA). It also cannot be used by <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> already used an MLE in the same season. Additionally, once a team uses the bi-annual exception, the tax apron becomes a hard salary cap {{for the remainder of}} that season.|$|E

25|$|A test {{match is}} a match {{played at the}} end of a season between <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> done badly in a higher league and one that has done well in a lower league of the same {{football}} league system. The format of a test match series varies; for instance it can be a head-to-head between one of the worse finishers of the higher league and one of the better finishers of the lower league, or it can be a mini league where all participants play each other or teams only play those from the other league. The winner of the test match series play in the higher league the following season, and the loser in the lower league.|$|E
25|$|The lottery is {{conducted}} with witnesses (from {{the accounting firm}} Ernst & Young) verifying that all fourteen balls are represented once as they are placed in the lottery machine. The balls are placed in the machine for 20 seconds to randomize before the first ball is drawn. The remaining three balls are drawn at 10-second intervals. NBA officials determine which team holds the winning combination and that franchise is awarded the #1 overall draft pick. The four balls are returned to the machine and the process is repeated to determine {{the second and third}} picks. In the event that a combination belongs to <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> already won its pick (or if the one unassigned combination comes up), the round is repeated until a unique winner is determined. When the first three teams have been determined, the remaining picks are given out based on regular season record with the worst teams getting the highest picks. This assures each team that it can drop no more than three spots from its projected draft position.|$|E

500|$|The fair catch kick has {{its origins}} in rugby football. The rule is {{considered}} to be obscure and unusual, as most fair catches are made well out of field goal range, and in most cases <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> a fair catch within theoretical range will attempt a normal drive to score a touchdown. [...] The fair catch kick is generally used when a team has fair caught a ball within field goal range and there is insufficient time to score a touchdown. At the professional level, the last successful fair catch kick was made in 1976.|$|E
2500|$|The word [...] "percentage" [...] {{is often}} a misnomer {{in the context of}} sports statistics, when the {{referenced}} number is expressed as a decimal proportion, not a percentage: [...] "The Phoenix Suns' Shaquille O'Neal led the NBA with a [...]609 field goal percentage (FG%) during the 2008–09 season." [...] (O'Neal made 60.9% of his shots, not 0.609%.) Likewise, the winning percentage of a team, the fraction of matches that the club has won, is also usually expressed as a decimal proportion; <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> a [...]500 winning percentage has won 50% of their matches. The practice is probably related to the similar way that batting averages are quoted.|$|E
2500|$|The 2011 CBA put further {{restrictions}} on sign-and-trades, with these restrictions maintained in the 2017 CBA. Since the 2013–14 season, the payroll of the receiving team cannot exceed the so-called [...] "apron" [...] (as of 2017–18 set at $6 million above the tax line) {{as a result}} of the trade, and <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> used the taxpayers' MLE cannot receive a player in a sign-and-trade in that season. Additionally, the apron becomes a hard salary cap for the first season after the signing. Teams above the apron before the trade cannot receive a player unless the trade leaves the team below the apron.|$|E

[...] After a remarkable three-game Munster final saga with reigning champions Tipperary, Cork qualified for an All-Ireland final showdown with Kilkenny. [...] Legendary trainer Jim ‘Tough’ Barry was at the Cork helm for the first, as snow covered Croke Park {{on the day of the}} game.

2500|$|Ideally the {{management}} of abdominal pregnancy should be done by <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> medical personnel from multiple specialties. Potential treatments consist of surgery with termination of the pregnancy (removal of the fetus) via laparoscopy or laparotomy, use of methotrexate, embolization, and combinations of these. [...] Sapuri and Klufio indicate that conservative treatment is also possible if the following criteria are met: 1. there are no major congenital malformations; 2. the fetus is alive; 3. there is continuous hospitalization in a well-equipped and well-staffed maternity unit which has immediate blood transfusion facilities; 4. there is careful monitoring of maternal and fetal well being; and 5. placental implantation is in the lower abdomen away from the liver and spleen. The choice is largely dictated by the clinical situation. [...] Generally, treatment is indicated when the diagnosis is made; however, {{the situation of the}} advanced abdominal pregnancy is more complicated.|$|E

The show now holds the annual tradition of matching up entries in the Looks Like Game with teams in the NCAA Tournament and updating the results with each round. The Looks Like Game is also frequently the ending to athlete interviews, particularly if the athlete is associated with <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> a popular entry. In addition, weekly interviews during the baseball season with Tim Kurkjian are concluded with new submissions to the Looks Like Game because Kurkjian finds the game particularly humorous and often gives uproarious laughter to the segment.|$|E
