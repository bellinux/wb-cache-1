It is <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> slimmer and has a smaller head than the scarlet robin, and is clearly larger than the red-capped. Females of the respective species are harder to tell apart. Those of red-capped, rose and pink robins are all smaller, with wing lengths less than , smaller than the smallest flame robin. The female scarlet robin has a more pronounced red flush to the breast and the spot on the crown above the bill is more prominent and white rather than off-white.|$|E

500|$|As {{part of the}} MTA's [...] "Arts for Transit" [...] program, three mosaics by Xenobia Bailey, which total {{approximately}} , {{were installed}} in three locations within the station. The artworks, titled Funktional Vibrations, are based on some of Bailey's crocheting patterns, and is located in an oval-shaped recession in the ceiling at the 34th Street entrance. The other two mosaics {{are located in the}} station entrances. The tiles used in Funktional Vibrations were created by mosaic craftsman Stephen Miotto, who manufactured the tiles in his Carmel, New York, studio. Another section of the artwork is expected to be installed in the second entrance by spring 2017. However, there is no artwork {{in the rest of the}} station; one Newsweek writer observed that while the station was [...] "very clean but <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> antiseptic", [...] "cool", and [...] "efficient", it was also [...] "lacking all character" [...] with its austere design.|$|E

500|$|Peter Duval Smith, in the Financial Times, was in two {{minds about}} the book, believing {{on the one}} hand that [...] "the {{background}} is excellent... Mr. Fleming has caught the exact 'feel' of Japan", and on the other that You Only Live Twice [...] "is not really a success and it's Bond's fault mainly. He just doesn't add up to a human being". Maggie Ross, in The Listener was <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> dissatisfied, writing that the novel can be read as a thriller and, [...] "if interest flags, as it may do, the book can be treated as a tourist guide to some of the more interesting parts of Japan." [...] She {{went on to say that}} [...] "since not very much in the way of real excitement happens until the latter half of the book, perhaps it is better to ignore the whole thing".|$|E
500|$|Nixon and Broderick also crafted the {{character}} as a darkly brooding and mysterious {{man in the}} same vein as gothic literary heroes such as Heathcliff from Wuthering Heights, Edward Rochester from Jane Eyre, and Maxim de Winter from Rebecca. Nixon used these characters as inspiration for Dimitri because, as she told Soap Opera Weekly, [...] "In doing the 'stolen life' story, I felt that we needed something to follow that was <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> larger than life, very romantic, and gothic." [...] The characters played a part in shaping Dimitri as well as his environment and storylines. Maxim de Winter's estate, Manderley, provided the inspiration for Dimitri's Pine Valley estate, Wildwind. The design was taken from both the description in Du Maurier's book and the depiction from the film Rebecca, a 1940 adaptation of the novel by Alfred Hitchcock. Like Mr. Rochester, the wife Dimitri falsely claims died years ago is revealed to be alive just before his marriage to another woman.|$|E
500|$|Visual {{effects for}} Doctor Strange were {{provided}} by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Method Studios, Framestore, Lola VFX, Luma Pictures, Rise FX, Crafty Apes, and SPOV, contributing to 1450 effects shots. Previsualization was handled by The Third Floor. All vendors worked on the common magical elements (mandalas, magical runes shields, whips, stalks and aerial 'lily pads', and portals). Visual effects supervisor Stephane Ceretti, who also worked on Guardians of the Galaxy, explained {{the similarities and differences}} between the two films, saying, [...] "there's some resemblance in {{some of the things that}} we've done. In the same way, it's a totally different world. In , it's more sci-fi oriented and crazy colors. More of a comedy kind of take on things as well. This one is a little bit more serious. It's <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more trippy. We use very different techniques, actually. Guardians was also for us a huge animation film. This one was less of it. This one was more about the environments and effects".|$|E

500|$|As {{the show}} progresses, Alex and Ryan's romance evolves into a {{relationship}}. When Alex confesses that her only motive {{to join the}} Academy was {{to find out the}} truth about her father and was about to leave, Ryan makes her realize that she is meant to be an agent. Alex's on-again off-again relationship with Ryan has been described by Chopra as star-crossed. She said [...] "Alex and Ryan are star-crossed lovers. You love them and they fight and have this intense passionate bond. But Alex is <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> self-destructive. She's a solitary person and she's not vulnerable enough, whereas Ryan really is. She's a little rough around the edges and whatever's happened in the past, she has trust issues. So that leads to issues in their relationship." [...] Fans have dubbed Alex and Ryan [...] "Ralex". On being asked about the possibility of having to choose between Ryan and saving the world, Chopra said [...] "I'm pretty sure she'd pick saving the world, because she's that kind of person." ...|$|E
500|$|The boys {{seek help}} from a medium (a parody of Zelda Rubinstein's {{character}} in Poltergeist), who explains the celebrities are trapped in purgatory, which she compares to being stuck on a plane waiting endlessly on a runway for permission to take off. The medium manages to contact the spirits {{and tell them that}} they have passed on. Much to her surprise, the celebrities say that they all accept the fact. Two deceased celebrities, CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite and Patrick Swayze, tell her that Michael Jackson's refusal to acknowledge his death is the main cause of them being trapped. Some of the celebrities help the medium and the boys try to convince Jackson that he is dead, but Jackson keeps denying it and insists he is not only alive, but <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> white girl. His denial is so strong that he emits a very powerful force which flings the medium out the window of Ike's hospital room, where she falls to her death. The ghosts of these annoyed celebrities are shown in purgatory, which resembles the interior of an airplane, complete with seats, flight attendants and pilot voice-over announcements.|$|E
500|$|The Sentinels had two {{separate}} versions, to depict how the earlier prototypes built by Trask in the 1970s {{evolved into the}} adaptable killing machines of the dystopian future. Singer described the 1973 version as [...] "a little fun and stylish but <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> retro", with a key element being that they are made of plastic to be unaffected by Magneto's powers. Myhre used styles from molded plastics from the 1970s to design Sentinels from that period, and cited inspiration from both the cars of the decade and [...] "those wonderful TV sets that were round with smoked glass panels". The overall style was bulky to fit [...] "the traditional idea of a robot looks like", and drew the most from the comics version, such as the purple color and a humanoid shape, while trying to stand out on its own with its retro design. The robots' ability to fly was compared to a Harrier Jump Jet, as the Sentinels had vertical takeoff and could glide. Life-sized Sentinels were built by Legacy Effects to be featured on the set, and had articulated joints to be fully poseable. The sound effects averted metallic noises, while adding woof effects on the Sentinels' footsteps to display its weight on the ground.|$|E

500|$|TV Week {{described}} Donna as [...] "beautiful and a {{free spirit}} who is <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> loud and obnoxious", while the Metro called her [...] "kooky." [...] The teens of Ramsay Street warm to her eventually and with their help, Donna changes her ways and becomes accepted. The official Neighbours website states that Donna has become a warm, loveable, charming and playful girl. Her integration {{into the street and}} the lives of the other residents has matured Donna and she leads the normal life she always wanted. In May 2009, Robbie said that Donna is a [...] "really likeable character" [...] and that she gets to play out funny and crazy storylines while playing her. In November of that year, it was revealed that Robbie had begged the scriptwriters to let Donna go off the rails or go to rehab. Robbie said that she would like a dramatic storyline, but the show's G rating makes it difficult. Robbie also said that she enjoys playing Donna, as she is [...] "great" [...] and a [...] "bit crazy". She added [...] "I'm really glad I get to play her and not an average, boring teenage girl. You can be an average, boring teenage girl every other day of the week. It's fun {{to be able to say}} and do these things you normally wouldn't".|$|E
500|$|In January 2016, Joss Whedon {{noted that}} this process [...] "unfortunately just means the TV show gets, you know, leftovers." [...] He stated that, for example, the series' {{creative}} team initially wanted to use Loki's scepter from The Avengers but were unable due to Whedon's plans for it in Age of Ultron. On how their ability {{to connect with the}} films changed {{over the life of the}} series, Jed Whedon said, [...] "The rule when we started was we couldn't say anything about spies, we couldn't say anything about Hydra, we couldn't have any A.I. or robots or anything like that, because all of that was coming in movies that year or the year after. Since then, they've blown those doors wide open." [...] He added, [...] "We have relatively free rein we just can't go anywhere that [...] going. They know their stories so much further out than we do, which is good for us to tee up things that we know are coming to them or avoid things that they want to be special on the big screen. As long as we are not covering bases that they're going to cover, we haven't been told [...] "no" [...] that much". As an example, Whedon noted the fourth season's Framework storyline as [...] "something that's pretty significant in our world, but is <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> eddy in the river that doesn't affect anything else because it's an alternate universe. So those kinds of stories help us go big without sending ripples through the whole MCU." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to literature, the episode spoofs the Ocean's Trilogy, a film series {{about a group}} of criminals that heist casinos. Selman revealed to Entertainment Weekly in January 2011 that the episode is essentially about [...] "Homer and some people in Springfield hav to perpetrate an Ocean's Eleven–style heist in the non-Ocean's Eleven world of children’s fantasy book publishing." [...] Throughout the episode as the story progresses, title cards with titles such as [...] "The Crew", [...] "The Setup", [...] "The Heist", and [...] "The Payday" [...] appear. During these title cards, which last for about three to four seconds each, a version of the song [...] "Gritty Shaker" [...] by David Holmes is heard. This song was played for approximately three minutes during a scene in Ocean's Eleven. On his blog, The Simpsons music editor Chris Ledesma wrote that Selman wanted [...] "Gritty Shaker" [...] to be played repeatedly throughout [...] "The Book Job" [...] because he erroneously thought that was how it was done in film. During the heist of TweenLit Inc.'s headquarters, the screen splits in several ways, showing the different team members making their way to the printing room. According to Selman, [...] "the set-up and feel [...] is a real creative departure for us. It's sort of a heist movie where the heist is writing a book but when that kicks in, there's a giant stylistic leap. It's <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sillier, a little more stylistic than most episodes. We're coming up on 500 episodes, but really, {{this is the kind of}} episode a show would only do if hadn't already had a couple hundred episodes." [...] Cuban American actor Andy García, who appeared in the Ocean's Trilogy as casino owner Terry Benedict, guest starred in [...] "The Book Job" [...] as the book publishing executive. At the end of January 2011, the recording of his performance took place.|$|E
