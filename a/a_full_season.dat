5|$|After <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>season</b> in 1988 and the team's first {{championship}} points, {{courtesy of}} Claudio Langes in 1989, {{it became apparent}} that Forti was improving as a competitive force.

From 1993 onwards, Forti concentrated solely on F3000, and ran drivers such as Naspetti, Fabrizio Giovanardi, Andrea Montermini and Hideki Noda. 1991 was Forti's most successful season in F3000, with Naspetti finishing third in the Drivers' Championship, ten points behind champion Christian Fittipaldi.
