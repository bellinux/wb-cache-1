5|$|The IFC prepares {{consolidated}} {{financial statements}} in accordance with United States GAAP which are audited by KPMG. It reported income before grants to IDA members of $2.18 billion in fiscal year 2011, up from $1.95 billion in fiscal 2010 and $299 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in income before grants is ascribed to higher earnings from the IFC's investments and also from higher service fees. The IFC reported a partial offset from lower liquid asset trading income, higher administrative costs, and higher advisory service expenses. The IFC made $600 million in grants to IDA countries in fiscal 2011, up from $200 million in fiscal 2010 and $450 million in fiscal 2009. The IFC reported a net income of $1.58 billion in fiscal year 2011. In previous years, the IFC had reported {{a net loss of}} $151 million in fiscal 2009 and $1.75 billion in fiscal 2010. The IFC's total capital amounted to $20.3 billion in 2011, of which $2.4 billion was paid-in capital from member countries, $16.4 billion was retained earnings, and $1.5 billion was <b>accumulated</b> <b>other</b> comprehensive income.

Among farmers who managed to consolidate large flocks, especially middle-aged farmers, migration to the USA was not considered an option.

The amalgamation of our current findings regarding the application of [18 F]FTC- 146 to WT and age-matched S 1 R-KO mice with our previous findings provides definitive evidence that our tracer is highly specific and selective for S 1 Rs, both in vitro and in vivo. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate a S 1 R radiotracer in S 1 R-KO mice and to demonstrate a correlation between tracer accumulation and S 1 R immunostaining in brain.|$|R
