Patton, during the sex scandal that tarnished his administration. On September 14, 2005, Fletcher fired nine employees, including {{four of the}} nine he pardoned two weeks earlier. The firings were praised by Fletcher critic Charles Wells of the Kentucky Association of State Employees, who said: [...] "When <b>all</b> <b>else</b> <b>fails,</b> the governor did the right thing." [...] However, Democratic state senator and former governor Julian Carroll criticized Fletcher for not firing the indicted officials when he issued the pardons. Fletcher also called for the firing of state Republican Party chair Darrell Brock, Jr. due to Brock's role in the merit scandal. The state Republican executive committee met on September 17, but did not act on Fletcher's call to fire Brock.|$|E

2500|$|Masami Eiri is {{introduced}} {{as the project}} director on Protocol Seven (the next-generation Internet protocol in the series' time-frame) for major computer company Tachibana General Laboratories.

He then [...] "uploaded" [...] his own brain, conscience, consciousness, memory, feelings, emotions – his very self – into the Wired and [...] "died" [...] a few days after, leaving only his physical, living body behind. These details are unveiled around {{the middle of the}} series, but this is the point where the story of Serial Experiments Lain begins. Masami later explains that Lain is the artifact by which the wall between the virtual and material worlds is to fall, and that he needs her to get to the Wired and [...] "abandon the flesh", as he did, to achieve his plan. The series sees him trying to convince her through interventions, using the promise of unconditional love, romantic seduction and charm, and even, when <b>all</b> <b>else</b> <b>fails,</b> threats and force.|$|E

2500|$|The show usually {{concluded}} with Red giving {{a message to}} his wife, Bernice (usually a double entendre), and delivering his signature piece of life advice {{in the form of}} a hockey metaphor: [...] "Keep your stick on the ice." [...] This was followed by a general meeting of the Possum Lodge membership while the credits rolled, which began with the ritual stating of the Lodge motto: [...] "Quando omni flunkus moritati" [...] (Pseudo-Latin for [...] "When <b>all</b> <b>else</b> <b>fails,</b> play dead"). From season six onward, this was often followed by the Man's Prayer: [...] "I'm a man, but I can change, if I have to, I guess." [...] In the final episode of the series, a revised version of the prayer was said: [...] "I'm a man, but I changed, because I had to. Oh well."

2500|$|Because {{pension schemes}} save up {{significant}} amounts of money, which many people rely on in retirement, protection against an employer's insolvency, or dishonesty, or risks from the stock market were seen as necessary after the 1992 Robert Maxwell scandal. Defined contribution funds must be administered separately, not subject to an employer's undue influence. The Insolvency Act 1986 also requires that outstanding pension contributions are a preferential over creditors, except those with fixed security. However, defined benefit schemes are also meant to insure everyone has a stable income {{regardless of whether they}} live a shorter or longer period after retirement. The Pensions Act 2004 sections 222 to 229 require that pension schemes have a minimum [...] "statutory funding objective", with a statement of [...] "funding principles", whose compliance is periodically evaluated by actuaries, and shortfalls are made up. The Pensions Regulator is the non-departmental body which is meant to oversee these standards, and compliance with trustee duties, which cannot be excluded. However, in The Pensions Regulator v Lehman Brothers the Supreme Court concluded that if the Pensions Regulator issued a [...] "Financial Support Direction" [...] to pay up funding, and it was not paid when a company had gone insolvent, this ranked like any other unsecured debt in insolvency, and did not have priority over banks that hold floating charges. In addition, there exists a Pensions Ombudsman who may hear complaints and take informal action against employers who fall short of their statutory duties. If <b>all</b> <b>else</b> <b>fails,</b> the Pension Protection Fund guarantees a sum is ensured, up to a statutory maximum.|$|E
2500|$|Starways Congress wants its fleet back. After <b>all</b> <b>else</b> <b>fails,</b> {{it sends}} {{the dilemma of}} the fleet's {{impossible}} disappearance to several citizens {{of the world of}} Path, a cultural planetary enclave modeled on early China. [...] Path's culture centers on the godspoken – those who hear the voices of the gods in the form of irresistible compulsions, and are capable of significantly superior intelligence. It later becomes clear that the godspoken of Path are victims of a cruel government project: granted great intelligence by genetic modification, they were also shackled with a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder to control their loyalty. [...] The experiment is set in a culture bound by five dictates – obey the gods, honor the ancestors, love the people, serve the rulers, then serve your self. This is a further safeguard against rebellion. The superintelligent godspoken are considered the most devout and holy of all citizens, and any disloyal thoughts in a godspoken's mind are immediately suppressed by overwhelming obsessive-compulsive behavior, believed to be a sign from the gods the thoughts are wrong. The most respected godspoken on Path is Han Fei-Tzu, for devising a treaty to prevent the rebellion of several colony worlds after the articles published by Demosthenes. Great things are expected of his daughter and potential successor Han Qing-jao, [...] "Gloriously Bright". While doubting the existence of the gods himself, Han Fei-Tzu promised his dying wife he would raise Qing-jao with an unwavering belief in the godspoken. The two of them are tasked by Starways Congress with deciphering the disappearance of the Lusitania Fleet. Han Qing-jao's secret maid, Si Wang-mu, aids her in this task, her intelligence (partially) unfettered by the rigid caste system.|$|E

2500|$|The {{founding}} members of Zao, were vocalist Eric Reeder, guitarist Roy Goudy, bassist Mic Cox, and drummer Jesse Smith. The band's {{name comes from}} the Greek word (ζάω), which means [...] "alive" [...] or [...] "to have life". Zao vocalist Eric Reeder has been credited with {{coming up with the}} band's name. Calling their sound [...] "Christ-centered hardcore", they sought to reach an audience that they felt has been pushed away from the organized church. Most of their early songs, which appeared on their first two full-length albums, <b>All</b> <b>Else</b> <b>Failed</b> and The Splinter Shards the Birth of Separation (which saw the band re-recording much of the <b>All</b> <b>Else</b> <b>Failed</b> material), contained explicit references to God and centered on the theme of the peace of God. Reeder (who appeared on Zao's Author and Sustained demos, as well as a split with Outcast) left before Zao recorded <b>All</b> <b>Else</b> <b>Failed</b> and was replaced by Shawn Jonas, who went on to form Symphony in Peril. Jonas left the band after recording two albums and is now a youth pastor at New Life Church in West Virginia; original bassist Mic Cox left the band, and Kevin Moran took his place. Ron Gray also joined the band as a second guitarist after the recording of The Splinter Shards the Birth of Separation. All of the band members, except for drummer Jesse Smith, quit Zao following the 1997 Cornerstone festival and a couple of shows they played on the way back home.|$|R
