5|$|Interest in {{maintaining}} the canal for its <b>amenity</b> <b>value</b> began before the canal closed, with the Inland Waterways Association mounting a campaign to retain it when plans to close it were first announced in 1952. They were already formulating plans for {{the revival of the}} Thames and Severn Canal, which depended on the Stroudwater for its link to the River Severn. The National Parks Commission declared that it should be retained for its <b>amenity</b> <b>value</b> and beauty in 1954, but it was closed nevertheless.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before its}} closure, there was {{interest}} in retaining the canal for its <b>amenity</b> <b>value.</b> The Stroudwater Canal Society, which {{later became the}} Cotswold Canals Trust, was formed in 1972. Following initial hostility from the Proprietors, {{who had not been}} stripped of their powers when the canal had closed, agreement was reached and work began on restoration of the waterway. The project gained popularity, and in 2003, a bid was made to the Heritage Lottery Fund for £82 million to restore both the Stroudwater Navigation and the Thames and Severn Canal. The project had to be split into smaller parts, and only the first phase has so far been funded in this way, when a grant of £11.9 million was confirmed in 2006. With match funding, this was to enable the section from 'The Ocean' at Stonehouse to Wallbridge to be reopened, together with the Wallbridge to Brimscombe Port section of the Thames and Severn.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{exploitation}} of environmental resources in a growing economy within a second-best fiscal policy framework. Agents derive utility from two types of consumption goods — one which relies on an environmental input and one which does not — {{as well as from}} leisure and from environmental <b>amenity</b> <b>values.</b> Property rights for the environmental resource are potentially incomplete. We connect second best policy to essential components of utility by considering the elasticity of substitution among each of the four utility arguments. The results illustrate potentially important relationships between environmental <b>amenity</b> <b>values</b> and leisure. When <b>amenity</b> <b>values</b> are complementary with leisure, for instance when environmental amenities are used for recreation, optimal taxes on dirty goods generally increase over time. On the other hand, optimal taxes on dirty goods generally decrease over time when leisure and environmental <b>amenity</b> <b>values</b> are substitutes.

40|$|This {{research}} suggests that consumers' marginal willingness to pay for environmental landscape attributes, such as water view, developed open space and forest-land open space, decreased during the 2008 recession compared to the 2000 - 2006 real estate boom. Estimates were obtained from a spatial hedonic housing price model after controlling for household location patterns and structural differences between the periods. Because the decline in <b>amenity</b> <b>values</b> was probably due to a temporary deterioration in economic conditions, the <b>amenity</b> <b>values</b> will probably rebound with economic recovery. Thus, development decisions based on the lower estimated <b>amenity</b> <b>values</b> measured during a temporary deterioration in economic conditions may be determined suboptimal post-economic recovery. environmental amenity, landscape, real estate boom, recession, spatial hedonic model,...|$|R
40|$|There are a {{multitude}} of interdisciplinary values that people derive from rural land. Productivism focuses on the commodity values of rural land, {{such as the use}} of land as a commercial input into agricultural production, timber harvesting and mineral extraction. Productivistic uses and values of rural land have been the traditional focus of rural land policy and management in the United States. Many rural areas in the United States are moving into a postproductivism era. Postproductivism focuses on both commodity and <b>amenity</b> <b>values</b> of rural land. <b>Amenity</b> <b>values</b> of rural land include recreational, aesthetic and ecological service values. When a rural area moves from productivism to postproductivism, value conflicts may arise between individuals and groups who have different preferences with respect to commodity and <b>amenity</b> <b>values.</b> Traditional rural institutions may not be set up to effectively handle such conflicts. There is a need to explore what types of institutions may be most effective in resolving rural land use problems related to the different and often competing values people place on rural land and landscapes. postproductivism, rural land values and preferences, commodity <b>values,</b> <b>amenity</b> <b>values,</b> Land Economics/Use,...|$|R

25|$|During the 1970s the Forestry Commission {{had begun}} {{a shift in}} focus to {{conservation}} and <b>amenity</b> <b>value</b> of their woods. The 1975 symposium considered the history and ecology of Bedford Purlieus and discussed how to retain and enhance {{the elements of the}} woods of greatest ecological value. The resulting publication, edited by G.F. Peterken and R.C. Welch, produced a detailed management plan. Among its recommendations were the restoration of areas of coppicing, and the reduction of conifers. The plan provided a basis for an ecological management of Bedford Purlieus within commercial constraints. Its designation as a national nature reserve in 2000 is a recognition {{of the extent to which}} the policy shift had been made. In 2005 it received an injection of funding from landfill tax credits arising from the nearby Augean landfill. This has facilitated the Forestry Commission to re-instate areas of coppicing, open up grassland glades and remove conifers and other introduced species.|$|E
2500|$|The {{industrial}} {{history of}} the site {{is reflected in the}} habitats and wildlife that it now supports. Historically, the Park would have predominantly been broadleaved woodland. Due to the activities of Saxon land clearance and subsequent land management through the medieval ages, this would have been converted to a patchwork of arable farmland, grassland and copses. By the Industrial Revolution, much of the Park area would have contained spoil mounds and quarry pits with isolated remnants of woodland and grassland habitats. [...] Since the abandonment of industry, the pit mounds and surrounding areas have reverted to heathland and extensive areas of grassland; the quarried areas have become lakes and ponds; and woodland, scrub and hedges have established elsewhere, including alongside the old canal and railway. This mosaic of different habitats now support a variety of wildlife including birds, invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, bats and other mammals. [...] In recognition of the educational and <b>amenity</b> <b>value</b> of this biodiversity resource, a significant proportion of the Park has been designated as a statutory Local Nature Reserve (LNR) (Figure 1.1).|$|E

40|$|In a {{detailed}} analysis, Small and Nicholls (2003) {{found that the}} coastal population is approximately three times the global average {{and that it is}} commonly believed that coastal migration is continuing and growing. Lazarow (2007) estimates that 86 % of Australians live within 30 minutes of the coast, while in small island nations the entire population is coastal. Development to support growing coastal populations puts pressure on many resources, including the natural features that create surfing waves (e. g., Anonymous, 2003; Lazarow, 2007; Mead et al., 2007; Pratte, 1987). It is asserted by this paper that the features that form a surfing break are a resource that possesses recreational <b>amenity</b> <b>values.</b> Surfing breaks need protection as these <b>amenity</b> <b>values</b> are important resources for coastal communities, both socially and economically (Lazarow, 2007; Lazarow, Miller, and Blackwell, 2007 a, 2007 b; Nelsen, Pendleton, and Vaughn, 2007).

2500|$|In 1982, Southwark Council leased the Wood to London Wildlife Trust {{to manage}} as a nature reserve. In 1984 Southwark Council’s Mid/South Southwark Local Plan {{included}} proposals for blocks {{of up to}} 146 flats on the top part of the Wood. London Wildlife Trust's Southwark Wildlife Group ran a [...] "Save the Woods" [...] campaign backed by West Lewisham MP John Maples and other local MPs. Dulwich MP Gerald Bowden asked the Secretary of State for the Environment to intervene. A full-page Evening Standard article set the scene for a New Year public inquiry into the Plan. The January inquiry heard evidence from a dozen ecologists on the Wood's wildlife diversity, other witnesses describing the Wood’s educational and <b>amenity</b> <b>value,</b> visited the site and listened to views from several hundred {{members of the public}} at an evening meeting at Kingswood House. Southwark MP Simon Hughes spoke in favour of saving the wood in the House of Commons. Further, Dulwich College Estates applied for planning permission to build 36 flats on the site of Beechgrove House. In July, the Local Plan inspector reported that most of the Wood should be protected from development. The written report was published in the same week that Southwark Council’s planning committee rejected the Beechgrove application. In advance of a public inquiry into the Beechgrove plans held in November 1986, Gerald Bowden MP said: [...] "I’ve never had quite such a wide range of ordinary people writing to me on one subject. There is very broad opposition to the flats." [...] The inspector's decision against the plan was hailed as [...] "Wood reprieve a policy precedent." [...] "The need to preserve areas of existing natural woodland within the urban areas is of as much importance in preserving our heritage and improving the quality of the environment as that of preserving the countryside," [...] the inspector said.|$|E

40|$|Retention of {{agricultural}} land {{is a principal}} goal for Michigan and its local governments. Local governments statewide are seeking options to stem losses {{of agricultural}} land. One option being widely consider is Purchase of Development Rights (PDR). This research assesses the willingness of residents in Kent County Michigan to support a PDR program and evaluates the relationship between <b>amenity</b> <b>values</b> associated with farmland and that support. While <b>amenity</b> <b>values</b> are important, with provision of local heritage the most identified amenity, the analysis report here does not show {{a significant relationship between}} demand for <b>amenity</b> <b>values</b> and willingness to support a PDR program. Cost is a significant factor, however. Michigan is the only state which does not have a preferential property tax assessment structure for agricultural land. Statistics show that Michigan farmers pay 50 % to 150 % more in property tax on agricultural land than do farmers in other midwest states. In theory, high property taxes make the cost of retaining land in agriculture higher, encouraging farmland owners to convert land from agriculture to other uses sooner than they might otherwise.

Consequently, conflicts between recreation and conservation may occur in multi-use MPAs, with scuba-divers impacting the natural environment on which the sport relies. Heavy usage by scuba divers also reduces <b>amenity</b> <b>values</b> in MPAs. The evidence is that critical social and biological thresholds exist. Above these thresholds <b>amenity</b> <b>values</b> are reduced severely, while biological impacts may also become significant.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to determine the spatial variation in <b>amenity</b> <b>values</b> for both quantity and quality of green open space in the housing market. Variables related to size, proximity, spatial configuration, and species composition of open space are endogenized in the global and local models in a hedonic price framework. Empirical evidence shows that amenities of different features of open space vary according to the degree of urbanization. In summary, evergreen trees, a diverse landscape with fragmented forest patches, and more complex and natural forest edges are more highly valued in Rural-Urban interfaces. In contrast, deciduous and mixed forests, larger forest blocks, and smoothly trimmed and man-made forest patch boundaries are more highly valued in urban core areas. As spatial variation in <b>amenity</b> <b>values</b> differs across a metropolitan area, the need for site-specific land use management to fit the local characteristics is recognized. ...|$|R
