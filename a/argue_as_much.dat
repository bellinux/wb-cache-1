40|$|Although {{theories}} of ideology or ‘internal impediments’ have been sidelined in most academic and popular discourse, they remain {{vital to the}} improvement of democratic politics. This essay <b>argues</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> insofar <b>as</b> {{theories of}} ideology have been dismissed {{on the grounds that}} their supposed reliance on conceptions of human nature necessarily undermines their potential contribution to human improvement. The argument is advanced {{in the context of a}} now obscure debate surrounding the work of C. B. Macpherson. Macpherson provides a framework which, for the very reasons it is dismissed by those interested in developing theories of ideology, remains alive to objections against such theories typically considered decisive. These are that the conceptions of human nature upon which such theories rely imply an essentialist and egoistic individualism resulting in an inability to appreciate the extent to which human beings are shaped by social and historical context. Using Aristotle as a counter-example to such charges, and in demonstrating Macpherson’s heavy reliance upon a relevantly similar form of individualist perfectionism, the dissertation provides reason to rethink the intellectual marginalization both of theories of ideology and of Macpherson’s political philosophy insofar as this has been effectuated or is considered justified by the claims here disputed...|$|R

40|$|Morality {{and slavery}} <b>argues</b> that, <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> {{detachment}} and dispassion govern standard historical practice, historians cannot escape making moral judgments. Precisely because slavery is a morally charged subject, its {{history has been}} especially prone to changing points of view, traceable, for example, in recent histories {{of the slave trade}} and the controversy over Olaudah Equiano s birthplace. Various polar extremes the structural coerciveness of slavery versus the agency of slaves; the persistence of African ethnicities versus rapid creolization; the spread of slavery versus the rapid growth of anti-slavery in the early republic are evident in historical interpretations, which necessarily involve complicated value judgments and serious moral ramifications. The essay concludes by suggesting that a measure of balance and fairness has been possible in the study of slavery. Through empathy, historians have been able to recover, in part at least, the hopes and fears, dreams and nightmares, notions of right and wrong among both slaves and masters in previous epochs. ...|$|R
40|$|The European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017 {{authorised}} the Prime Minister to {{give notice}} under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty of the UK’s intention {{to withdraw from}} the EU. The Act was adopted in response to R (Miller and Dos Santos) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union [2017] UKSC 5, in which the Supreme Court held, by majority, that the royal prerogative did not authorise the Government {{to begin the process of}} withdrawal from the EU Treaties. The House of Commons resisted attempts by the House of Lords to include conditions concerning the status of EU nationals and requiring subsequent parliamentary approval. Parliament’s refusal to limit the Government’s power to begin withdrawal from the EU was foreseeable – indeed it was foreseen by Lord Carnwath in his dissent in Miller (at [273]) – in light of the resolution of the House of Commons on 7 December 2016, the third day of the Supreme Court hearing, confirming the House’s support for the Government to trigger Article 50 by 31 March 2017. Not that the litigation was futile. The Supreme Court’s judgment raised the political cost of triggering Article 50, empowering the House of Lords and providing an occasion to oppose withdrawal and/or to propose conditions on notification or withdrawal. It is arguable that the Government ought in any case – quite apart from the law – to have invited the Houses of Parliament to signify their support for triggering Article 50, whether by way of resolutions in each House or by primary legislation.

40|$|Abstract: Malala Yousafzai was catapulted on to {{the global}} stage after she was {{attacked}} by Tehrik-e-Taliban militants while {{on her way to}} school in the Swat valley of Pakistan in October 2012.

This essay examines the conflicting narratives around Yousafzai in the international public sphere in order to develop a critical narrative on the politics of gender and governmentality after 11 September 2001. We locate Yousafzai within the frame of the global War on Terror and its relationship to Pakistan as a proxy state in global hegemonic politics and <b>argue</b> that <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> her entry on the global stage was presented as a victory for Muslim women that (a) nothing significant has shifted for them and (b) her celebration as an icon of freedom for Muslims is, in fact, intrinsically wedded to a discourse which utilizes gender equality in a utilitarian fashion to maintain a larger hegemonic system...|$|R
40|$|Journal ArticleSpecial Issue: Spindel Supplement: The Lives of Human AnimalsHumans are {{a kind of}} animal, and it is {{a natural}} and {{sensible}} idea that the way to understand what it is for a human person to persist over time is to reflect on what it is for an animal to persist. This paper accepts this strategy. However, especially in the light of a range of recent biological findings, the persistence of animals turns out to be much more problematic than is generally supposed. The main philosophical premise of the paper is that living systems generally are best treated as processes rather than things. These processes prove to be so complexly intertwined and interdependent, that there is no unique, objective way of distinguishing the individuals from which they are composed. For this reason the animalist perspective, it is <b>argued,</b> problematizes <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> it resolves the problem of personal identity. Traditional concerns with responsibility and reactive attitudes provide an intelligible and defensible motivation for distinguishing the individuals we standardly assume as the explanandum in these discussions.

The contradiction here is that regionalism is not always complying with WTO regulations such as including "substantially all trade" as well as "non discrimination" principle.

40|$|In 1961 Allan Kaprow (1927 – 2006) and Claes Oldenburg (b. 1929) {{exchanged}} {{a number of}} letters in which they argued about the definition of their avant-garde practices as Happenings. Kaprow, who first introduced this "root-metaphor," as he would later call it, describes with it the necessity of the respective activity to be as far removed as possible from all motives, materials, and formats conventionally connected to art. Oldenburg, {{who at the time}} of this exchange was just as active in the New York performance scene as Kaprow, disagrees with his colleague's removal of their practice from the artistic sphere. Oldenburg is also dissatisfied with the fact that Kaprow, through his writings, launches a critical discourse that follows his own definition of the Happening.

While it may be suggestive to position this new emergence as a collective of technoanthropological treaties as found, for example, in the Slow Media Manifesto (2010), there is an under-valued relation that I will discuss throughout this paper when considering the role that slow motion plays out as a condition rather than an effect of lens based practice.

40|$|Jurisprudentially speaking, "proselytism" is {{a concept}} within the larger genus of the {{protection}} of religious rights and freedoms. The word lends itself to differing opinions. However, there is a popular school of thought that "proselytism" has to do only with influencing people to adopt a particular religion. Such an understanding relies on the view that only the "religious" can be insidious and bear the potential to improperly proselytise, and thus excludes the possibility of improper irreligious forms of influence. In referring to the example of public-school education, it is <b>argued</b> that <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the religious {{has the potential for}} improper proselytising, irreligious teachings or expressions also run the risk of improper proselytising. Not only are irreligious beliefs in many instances diametrically opposed to religious beliefs; they are a belief in themselves and cannot be seen as necessarily harmless or without the potential to proselytise improperly. Consequently, this article introduces an equitable and accommodative understanding of proselytism, which places the potentially harmful effects of both religious and irreligious beliefs on an equal footing with each other (something befitting to plural and democratic paradigms). This article therefore also cultivates further debate on improper irreligious proselytism in religious rights and freedoms jurisprudence, a scant topic in human rights jurisprudence...|$|R
