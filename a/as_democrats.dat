5|$|As of November 2015, a {{majority}} of seats in the Maryland Senate are held {{by members of the}} Democratic Party, with 33 Democrats and 14 Republicans, greater than a two-thirds majority. This dominance is nothing new, <b>as</b> <b>Democrats</b> have had strong majorities in the chamber for decades. Democrats tend to control seats in the large population centers such as Baltimore City, Montgomery County, and Prince George's County, while Republicans control most seats on the Eastern Shore and in western Maryland. The chamber has also had significant numbers of women and African-Americans serve, with women averaging around 30% of the seats and African-Americans around 20%.|$|E

5|$|McEwen {{won four}} of the five {{counties}} in the district — Adams, Brown, Clermont and Warren. In Adams, once part of his district, he received 77% of the vote, sixty-seven points ahead of Portman. However, McEwen finished third in the largest county in the district, Hamilton, one he had never represented and which contained 57% of the Second District's registered voters. In the primary, Portman won only Hamilton County, but by a large enough margin to win the primary with 17,531 votes (35.61%), while McEwen received 14,542 (29.54%), Buchert 12,488 (25.37%), Dorsey 2,947 (5.99%), the rest scattering. The race in the Second District, one of the most Republican in the country, was determined in the primary — six times as many Republicans <b>as</b> <b>Democrats</b> voted in the primary — and Portman easily defeated attorney Lee Hornberger 53,020 (70.1%) to 22,652 (29.1%) in the special election on May 4.|$|E
5|$|The CSR {{subsidies}} {{are paid to}} insurance companies to reduce copayments and deductibles for a smaller group of ACA enrollees, those earning less than 250% of the federal poverty line (FPL). The second and larger type of subsidy, the premium tax credits designed to reduce the post-subsidy cost of monthly premiums, apply to all enrollees earning less than 400% of the FPL. For scale, during 2017, approximately $7 billion in CSR subsidies will be paid, versus $34 billion for the premium tax credits. A court decision meant that CSR subsidies were treated as discretionary spending, meaning Congress must decide to appropriate funds for them each year. This effectively gave the President the power to end them, <b>as</b> <b>Democrats</b> with a minority in Congress could not appropriate the funds, let alone override his veto of an appropriations bill.|$|E
5|$|While the {{committees}} are established by formal Senate rules, {{there are a}} number of caucuses that exercise significant influence over the legislative process. The most powerful of these are the Democratic Caucus and the Republican Caucus, each of which has a leader and a whip, referred to as a majority and minority leader and whip. <b>As</b> <b>Democrats</b> currently control a majority of seats in the Senate, their leader is referred to as the Majority Leader, and their caucus is able to influence legislation to a greater extent than the Republican caucus. The Majority Leader and Minority leader are responsible for managing their party's participation in debate on the floor. Party caucuses also raise and distribute campaign money to assist their candidates. The Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland and Women Legislators of Maryland, caucuses of African-American and female Senators respectively, also play prominent roles in the Senate.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{took control}} of the House in 1875, Randall was {{considered}} among the candidates for Speaker of the House. Many in the caucus hesitated, however, believing Randall to be too close to railroad interests and uncertain on the money question. His leadership in the Salary Grab may have harmed him, as well. Randall was also occupied by an intra-party battle with William A. Wallace for control of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party. Wallace, who had been elected to the United States Senate in 1874, was weakened by rumors that he had taken bribes from the railroads while a member of the State Senate. Randall wanted control of the Democratic machine statewide, and the Wallace faction's vulnerability on the bribery rumors provided the opportunity. In January 1875, he had friends in the state legislature begin an investigation into Wallace's clique, which ultimately turned state Democratic leaders against the senator. At the state Democratic convention in September 1875, Randall (with the help of his old ally, Squire McMullen) triumphed, putting his men in control of the state party.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the gender}} gap has varied over many years, {{women of all ages}} are {{more likely than men to}} {{identify}} <b>as</b> <b>Democrats.</b> Recent polls have indicated that 41% of women identify <b>as</b> <b>Democrats</b> while only 25% of women identify as Republicans and 26% as independents, while 32% of men identify <b>as</b> <b>Democrats,</b> 28% as Republicans and 34% as independents. Among ethnic minorities, women also are more likely than males to identify <b>as</b> <b>Democrats.</b> Also, American women that identified as single, living with a domestic partner, divorced, separated, or widowed are more likely than men in these categories to vote Democratic, in contrast to married Americans, which split about equally between Democrat and Republican. Again, women in these categories are significantly more likely than males in these categories to vote Democratic. The National Federation of Democratic Women is an affiliated organization meant to advocate for women's issues. The Woman's National Democratic Club works to promote the Democratic party. National women's organizations that support Democratic candidates are Emily's List, which aims to help elect pro-choice Democratic female candidates to office, and often but not always the National Organization for Women.|$|E
25|$|According to a Pew Research poll, the Democratic Party {{has become}} more {{socially}} liberal and secular compared to how it was in 1987.
