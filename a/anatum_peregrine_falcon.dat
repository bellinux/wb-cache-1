40|$|In 2003, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) {{implemented}} {{the first of}} five nationwide monitoring efforts for American <b>Peregrine</b> <b>Falcons</b> (Falco peregrinus <b>anatum)</b> (<b>Peregrine</b> <b>Falcons)</b> {{as described in the}} Service’s post-delisting monitoring plan (USFWS 2003). More than 300 observers monitored 438 <b>Peregrine</b> <b>Falcon</b> territories across six monitoring regions. Monitoring in the Southwestern monitoring region fell short of the monitoring goal, where 36 of the targeted 96 territories were monitored; efforts are underway to implement full-scale monitoring in that region in 2006. The five other monitoring regions surveyed sufficient territories to meet the statistical criteria described in the post-delisting monitoring plan. Our estimates of territory occupancy, nest success, and productivity were above the target values that we set in the monitoring plan for those nesting parameters. Additional data collected by this effort documented that the total number of nesting pairs of <b>Peregrine</b> <b>Falcons</b> is estimated at 3, 005. Additional data show that 92 % of pairs nest on natural substrates in all regions except the Midwestern/ Northeastern region, where only 32 % nest on natural substrates. Our estimates of the nesting parameters and the additional data from across the United States indicate that the <b>Peregrine</b> <b>Falcon</b> population is secure and vital. The next coordinated nationwide monitoring effort is scheduled for 2006 (USFWS 2003) ...|$|R

50|$|In the mid-1970s, Companion Rock {{was home}} to one of only seven {{remaining}} pairs of <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcons</b> in the Rocky Mountains region at the time. The experiences of Marcy Cottrell Houle in studying this pair of <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcons</b> was documented in her book Wings for My Flight: The <b>Peregrine</b> <b>Falcons</b> of Chimney Rock.|$|R
5|$|By 1975, <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcons</b> {{had been}} reduced to 324 pairs in North America, {{primarily}} as a result of DDT, a widely used pesticide. DDT lowered estrogen levels in female peregrines and inhibited the production of calcium, causing eggs to thin and break during incubation. Recovery efforts for the <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> have been remarkably successful: agricultural DDT was banned by the U.S. in 1972 and efforts to breed and train <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcons</b> in captivity to later release to the wild were effective. In 1999, the <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species list.|$|R
5|$|Marcy Cottrell Houle wrote Wings for My Flight in {{the several}} decades {{following}} a major {{decline in the}} <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> population, which occurred between 1950 and 1970. During the 1930s and 1940s, an estimated 1000 breeding pairs of <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcons</b> inhabited the western United States and Mexico, coupled with 500 pairs in the eastern U.S. By the 1970s, no <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcons</b> were discovered east of the Rocky Mountains, and in the west, <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> populations had declined by 80 to 90 percent. By 1975, {{the year in which}} the events of Wings for My Flight take place, only 324 pairs of <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcons</b> were known to reside in North America, with only seven pairs in the Rocky Mountains region, and one at Chimney Rock, a prominent rock formation in southwestern Colorado.|$|R
5|$|The <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> is host to a {{range of}} parasites and pathogens. It is a vector for Avipoxvirus, Newcastle disease virus, Falconid {{herpesvirus}} 1 (and possibly other Herpesviridae), and some mycoses and bacterial infections. Endoparasites include Plasmodium relictum (usually not causing malaria in the <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon),</b> Strigeidae trematodes, Serratospiculum amaculata (nematode), and tapeworms. Known <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> ectoparasites are chewing lice, Ceratophyllus garei (a flea), and Hippoboscidae flies (Icosta nigra, Ornithoctona erythrocephala).|$|R
40|$|<b>Peregrine</b> <b>falcons</b> occur nearly worldwide. In Washington, nesting {{may occur}} {{in all but}} the driest parts of the state (see Figure 1).

5|$|The <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> {{became an}} {{endangered}} species primarily due {{to the use of}} organochlorine pesticides, especially DDT, the breakdown of which lowered estrogen levels in the bloodstream of female <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcons</b> and inhibited the production of calcium, causing eggs to grow thinner by up to 20 percent. Since <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcons</b> lay their eggs on rocky ledges rather than nests, the thinned shells break under the stress of both the rocky ledge and the weight of the parents during incubation. Following 1970, recovery efforts for the <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> population have been successful. The agricultural use of DDT was banned in the United States in 1972, and recovery teams in the eastern United States were successful in breeding and training peregrines in captivity to later release to the wild, a procedure called hacking. In 1999, the <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species list.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Peregrine</b> <b>Falcon</b> was {{selected}} as the totem of Kintecoying Lodge. A native bird to New York City, the <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> is a symbol of strength, adventure, leadership and new beginnings. <b>Peregrine</b> <b>Falcons</b> are among the world’s most common birds of prey and live on all continents except Antarctica. They prefer wide-open spaces, and thrive near coasts where shorebirds are common, but they can be found everywhere from tundra to deserts. Peregrines are also found living on the bridges and skyscrapers of our city.
