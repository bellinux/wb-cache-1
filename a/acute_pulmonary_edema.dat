40|$|Abstract Background Continuous {{positive}} airway pressure (CPAP) {{treatment for}} <b>acute</b> cardiogenic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>edema</b> can have important benefits in acute cardiac care. However, coronary care units {{are usually not}} equipped and their personnel not adequately trained for applying CPAP with mechanical ventilators. Therefore we investigated in the coronary care unit setting the feasibility and outcome of the simple Boussignac mask-CPAP (BCPAP) system that does not need a mechanical ventilator. Methods BCPAP was introduced in a coronary care unit where staff had no CPAP experience. All consecutive patients transported to our hospital with <b>acute</b> cardiogenic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>edema,</b> a respiratory rate > 25 breaths/min and a peripheral arterial oxygen saturation of Results During the 2 -year prospective BCPAP study period 108 patients were admitted with <b>acute</b> cardiogenic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>edema.</b> Eighty-four of these patients (78 %) were treated at the coronary care unit of which 66 (61 %) were treated with BCPAP. During the control period 66 patients were admitted over a 1 -year period of whom 31 (47 %) needed respiratory support {{in the intensive care}} unit. BCPAP treatment was associated with a reduced hospital length of stay and fewer transfers to the intensive care unit for intubation and mechanical ventilation. Overall estimated savings of approximately € 3, 800 per patient were achieved with the BCPAP strategy compared to conventional treatment. Conclusion At the coronary care unit, BCPAP was feasible, medically effective, and cost-effective in the treatment of <b>acute</b> cardiogenic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>edema.</b> Endpoints included mortality, coronary care unit and hospital length of stay, need of ventilatory support, and cost (savings). </p...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} whether <b>acute</b> cardiogenic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>edema</b> {{is associated with}} damage to the alveolocapillary barrier, as evidenced by increased leakage of surfactant specific proteins into the circulation, to document the duration of alveolocapillary barrier damage in this setting, and to explore the role of pulmonary parenchymal inflammation by determining if circulating tumor necrosis factor-α is increased after <b>acute</b> cardiogenic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>edema.</b> Design: Prospective, observational study. Setting: Critical care, cardiac intensive care, and cardiology wards of a tertiary-care university teaching hospital. Patients: A total of 28 patients presenting with <b>acute</b> cardiogenic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>edema</b> and 13 age-matched normal volunteers. Interventions: Circulating surfactant protein-A and -B and tumor necrosis factor-α were measured on days 0 (presentation), 1, 3, 7, and 14. Clinical markers of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>edema</b> were documented at the same times. Measurements and Main Results: Surfactant protein-A and -B were elevated on day 0 compared with controls (367 ± 17 ng/mL vs. 303 ± 17 and 3821 ± 266 ng/mL vs. 2747 ± 157 [mean ± SEM], p 3 ̆c. 05), and although clinical, hemodynamic and radiographic variables improved rapidly (p 3 ̆c. 001), surfactant protein-A and -B rose further until day 3 (437 ± 22, p 3 ̆c. 001, 4642 ± 353, p 3 ̆c. 01). Tumor necrosis factor-α was elevated at presentation (p 3 ̆c. 05), doubled by day 1 (6. 98 ± 1. 36 pg/mL, p 3 ̆c. 05), remained elevated on day 3 (5. 72 ± 0. 96 pg/mL, p 3 ̆c. 05), and peak levels were related to chest radiograph extravascular lung water score (rp = 0. 64, p =. 003). Conclusions: Although the initial increase in plasma surfactant protein-A and -B may represent hydrostatic stress failure of the alveolocapillary barrier, the prolonged elevation, when hemodynamic abnormalities have resolved, and the delayed elevation of tumor necrosis factor-α are consistent with pulmonary parenchymal inflammation, which may further damage the alveolocapillary barrier. This prolonged physiologic defect at the alveolocapillary barrier after <b>acute</b> cardiogenic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>edema</b> may partly account for the vulnerability of these patients to recurrent pulmonary fluid accumulation...|$|R

50|$|A lower V/Q ratio (with {{respect to}} the {{expected}} value for a particular lung area in a defined position) impairs pulmonary gas exchange and is a cause of low arterial partial pressure of oxygen (paO2). Excretion of carbon dioxide is also impaired, but {{a rise in the}} arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (paCO2) is very uncommon because this leads to respiratory stimulation and the resultant increase in alveolar ventilation returns paCO2 to within the normal range.
