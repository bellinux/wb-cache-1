2500|$|An <b>airport</b> <b>crash</b> <b>tender,</b> or [...] "crash rig", [...] is a {{specialized}} fire engine {{designed for use}} at aerodromes in aircraft accidents. Some of the features that make the crash rigs unique are their ability to move on rough terrain outside the runway and airport area, large water capacity {{as well as a}} foam tank, a high-capacity pump, and water/foam monitors. Newer ARFF vehicles also incorporate twin agent nozzles/injection systems to inject a stream of Purple-K dry chemical into the AFFF (Aqueous Film Forming Fluroprotein) foam stream, which [...] "flattens" [...] the fire faster. Some also have Halotron tanks with handlines for fires which must be extinguished with a dry chemical similar to the ones which {{can be found in a}} fire extinguisher. These features give the airport crash tenders a capability to reach an airplane rapidly, and rapidly extinguish large fires with jet fuel involved.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 March 2007 Ungdomshuset {{was cleared}} of its {{occupants}} {{by the police}} at about 7:00 (CET) in the morning. A 50-metre area surrounding the building was sealed off. The building was taken with assistance from a military helicopter, an <b>airport</b> <b>crash</b> <b>tender</b> and two boom cranes, used {{as a form of}} modern-day siege towers. Special forces entered the building from the roof, the windows and the ground, while the house was covered in foam to diminish the effectiveness of possible counterattacks such as Molotov cocktails. Afterwards the supporters of Ungdomshuset announced that it was [...] "either an Ungdomshus or a battle for an Ungdomshus — the clearing will never be forgiven". Rioting broke out, including a blockade of Nørrebrogade, the main street of Nørrebro, and fires in the areas surrounding Freetown Christiania and south of Nørrebrogade. Containers were turned over, windows were broken. Molotov cocktails were thrown out by the demonstrators, at the cries of [...] "The street are ours!" [...] Setting up barricades, they played alter-globalization songs such as Manu Chao from trucks. Riot police used tear gas (CS gas) on several occasions throughout the riots. The entire area was unsafe and neighbors to Ungdomshuset were told to stay indoors. It was unsafe to walk the streets because of the riots and because the police proclaimed that anyone without a valid reason for being on the streets would be arrested. There were also demonstrations in Oslo carried out by the Blitz community. The police moved out with police dogs and were prepared to use tear gas ...|$|E

They offer relatively good acceleration (for such large, heavy vehicles), {{are able to}} negotiate rough terrain outside the airport area, carry large capacities of water and fire fighting foam, are fitted with powerful high-capacity pumps and water/foam cannons, and are capable of delivering firefighting media over long distances. They can be mounted on 4x4, 6x6 or even 8x8 wheeled chassis.

Some brigades use slightly smaller appliances based on GVW of 7.5 tonnes, which do not require an LGV licence. They are common in rural brigades where narrow lanes and rough terrain would be difficult for a larger fire engine to negotiate.|$|R

Other vessels were equipped as high speed target tugs, pickets and for range safety. On the creation of the RAF, along with the seaplanes they served, these RNAS vessels and their crews would become the RAF's Marine Craft Section (MCS), However, the Navy was from the start opposed to and did its best to prevent the creation of the new service, of the vessels that were now theoretically part of the RAF some could not be found; others were carried aboard Royal Navy vessels that were not part of the RNAS transfer, and to which the RAF had no option but to acede to their transfer back to the Navy. The MCS officers tasked with carrying out an inventory of the new service's assets concluded that achieving the transfer of 323 vessels was possible. However, of those boats handed over, because of their war service, some 50℅ were unserviceable, with some in such a poor state of repair so as to be totally unseaworthy.|$|R
