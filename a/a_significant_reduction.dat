5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} the study and {{modelling}} of {{the transfer of the}} inert gas component of breathing gases from the gas in the lungs to the tissues of the diver and back during exposure to variations in ambient pressure.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the relationships between}} visceral obesity and hepatic steatosis in obese patients undergoing adjustable silicone gastric banding with the LAP-BAND. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Six premenopausal, morbidly obese women with an ultrasonographic diagnosis of liver steatosis were evaluated before surgery and 8 and 24 weeks after surgery. Liver volume and body fat distribution were simultaneously analyzed by total-body multislices magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Before surgery, the only variable found to be correlated with liver volume was visceral adipose tissue volume (r = 0. 91; p < 0. 01). Weight loss was 9. 9 +/- 3. 8 kg in the period from 0 to 8 weeks (p < 0. 01) and 7. 1 +/- 4. 9 kg in the the period from 8 to 24 weeks (p < 0. 05). Total fat showed <b>a</b> statistically <b>significant</b> <b>reduction</b> of 6. 2 +/- 4. 0 liters in the 0 - to 8 -week period and <b>a</b> further <b>significant</b> <b>reduction</b> of 7. 7 +/- 3. 9 liters in the 8 - to 24 -week period. Visceral adipose tissue showed <b>a</b> statistically <b>significant</b> <b>reduction</b> of 1. 0 +/- 0. 9 liters in the 0 - to 8 -week period (p < 0. 05) but only <b>a</b> further, not <b>significant</b> <b>reduction</b> of 0. 6 +/- 0. 7 liters in the 8 - to 24 -week period. The relative reduction of visceral fat in the 0 -to 8 -week period was higher than the relative reduction of total fat.

In the period following the declaration of independence, the war escalated, with the sieges of Vukovar and Dubrovnik, and fighting elsewhere, until a ceasefire of 3 January 1992 led to stabilization and <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>reduction</b> of violence. The war effectively ended in August 1995 with a decisive victory for Croatia as a result of Operation Storm.

From 1877 to 1887 he wrote for the nationalist magazines Neue Welt ("New World"), Heimat ("Homeland"), Deutsche Zeitung ("German Newspaper"), and the Neue Deutsche Alpenzeitung ("New German Alpine Newspaper"), with his articles being devoted to the Austrian countryside and the folk customs of its inhabitants. His interpretations emphasised what he believed were the pagan origins of Austrian place-names, customs, and legends, describing the landscape as being embodied by genius loci, and expressing clear German nationalist and völkisch sentiment.|$|E

5|$|The Swiss Federal budget had a size of 62.8 billion Swiss francs in 2010, {{which is}} an {{equivalent}} 11.35% of the country's GDP in that year; however, the regional (canton) budgets and the budgets of the municipalities are not counted {{as part of the}} federal budget and the total rate of government spending is closer to 33.8% of GDP. The main sources of income for the federal government are the value-added tax (33%) and the direct federal tax (29%) and the main expenditure is located in the areas of social welfare and finance & tax. The expenditures of the Swiss Confederation have been growing from 7% of GDP in 1960 to 9.7% in 1990 and to 10.7% in 2010.

5|$|Guadeloupe {{was taken}} over as a British colony for the {{remainder}} of the war, only restored to France after Napoleon's abdication in 1814. The following year, during the Hundred Days, Guadeloupe's governor Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois declared for the Emperor once more, requiring another British invasion, although of much smaller size and duration, to restore the monarchy. The fall of Guadeloupe marked the end of the final French territory in the Caribbean; the entire region was now in the hands of either the British or the Spanish, except the independent state of Haiti. The lack of French privateers and warships sparked a boom in trade operations, and the economies of the Caribbean islands experienced a resurgence. It also made <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>reduction</b> in French international trade and had a corresponding effect on the French economy. Finally, the capture of the last French colony struck a decisive blow to the Atlantic slave trade, which had been made illegal by the British government in 1807 and was actively persecuted by the Royal Navy. Without French colonies in the Caribbean, there was no ready market for slaves in the region and the slave trade consequently dried up.|$|E

5|$|Population {{studies from}} the mid-20th century onwards show topical {{fluoride}} reduces dental caries. This was first {{attributed to the}} conversion of tooth enamel hydroxyapatite into the more durable fluorapatite, but studies on pre-fluoridated teeth refuted this hypothesis, and current theories involve fluoride aiding enamel growth in small caries. After studies of children in areas where fluoride was naturally present in drinking water, controlled public water supply fluoridation to fight tooth decay began in the 1940s and is now applied to water supplying 6 percent of the global population, including two-thirds of Americans. Reviews of the scholarly literature in 2000 and 2007 associated water fluoridation with <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>reduction</b> of tooth decay in children. Despite such endorsements and evidence of no adverse effects other than mostly benign dental fluorosis, opposition still exists on ethical and safety grounds. The benefits of fluoridation have lessened, possibly due to other fluoride sources, but are still measurable in low-income groups. Sodium monofluorophosphate and sometimes sodium or tin(II) fluoride are often found in fluoride toothpastes, first introduced in the U.S. in 1955 and now ubiquitous in developed countries, alongside fluoridated mouthwashes, gels, foams, and varnishes.|$|E
5|$|The {{previously}} described study by Timby et al. (2015) also assessed {{the effects of}} MFGM supplementation in term infants on the risk of infectious diseases and other disease symptoms. In particular, the cumulative incidence of acute otitis media was analyzed between the two randomized feeding groups (control formula or MFGM- supplemented formula to 6 months of age), and compared to a breastfed reference group. The MFGM-supplemented group experienced <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>reduction</b> in episodes of acute otitis media up to 6 months of age compared with infants fed control formula (1% vs 9%; P=0.034); with {{no significant difference in}} otitis media incidence compared to the breastfed group (0%). In addition, a significantly lower incidence and longitudinal prevalence of antipyretic drug use was seen in the MFGM-supplemented group (25%) compared with the control formula group (43%). Timby et al. (2017) further showed that the MFGM supplementation influenced the infants’ oral microbiota; the authors noted that, Moraxella catarrhalis, a common bacterial cause of acute otitis media, was less prevalent in infants fed the MFGM-supplemented formula than in those fed control formula.|$|E
5|$|These initial concerns, however, {{were short}} lived, {{at least in}} the {{beginning}} as the British government provided assurances that it would underwrite a large amount of the war risk insurance for shipping in order to allow trade amongst the Commonwealth to continue. Shortly thereafter the wartime direction of trade began when the British asked the Australian government to place certain restrictions upon overseas trade in order to secure resources vital to the war effort and to limit the ability of the Central Powers from obtaining these goods from Commonwealth nations via neutral third parties. To an extent these restrictions served to reduce the ability of Australian producers to find buyers for their products, at least initially, however, in many cases the British stepped in to buy these goods, thus alleviating Australian concerns about <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>reduction</b> in the standard of living.
