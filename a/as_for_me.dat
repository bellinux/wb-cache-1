Surrounding each one was the dim outline of a small human figure, black and grotesque, more like a little image carved out of black shining wood, than anything else I can liken them to. Dorothea kissed her hands to these dreadful little shapes, and Michael bowed with great reverence. <b>As</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> and my companions, we were so awe-struck yet amused at these comical shapes, {{that we could not}} move or speak until they themselves seemed to flit about in a sort of wavering dance, and then vanish, one by one.|$|E

As she wears a {{transparent}} nightgown in the music video, some French television channels censored it. It was first aired on the French television programme Clip Clap in a shortened version. In an interview, Farmer deplored the censorship, saying: [...] " [...] has shocked many people. I find it pretty stupid.

500|$|In September 1951, after {{a series}} of {{differences}} with Bradbury and other scientists, Teller resigned from Los Alamos, and returned to the University of Chicago. At about the same time, Ulam went on leave as a visiting professor at Harvard for a semester. Although Teller and Ulam submitted a joint report on their design and jointly applied for a patent on it, they soon became involved in a dispute over who deserved credit. [...] After the war, Bethe returned to Cornell University, but he was deeply involved in the development of thermonuclear weapons as a consultant. [...] In 1954, he wrote an article {{on the history of the}} H-bomb, which presents his opinion that both men contributed very significantly to the breakthrough. [...] This balanced view is shared by others who were involved, including Mark and Fermi, but Teller persistently attempted to downplay Ulam's role. [...] "After the H-bomb was made," [...] Bethe recalled, [...] "reporters started to call Teller the father of the H-bomb. For the sake of history, I think it is more precise to say that Ulam is the father, because he provided the seed, and Teller is the mother, because he remained with the child. <b>As</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> I guess I am the midwife." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of Buck's final public {{appearances}} was on September 17, 2001 at Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis.

Although looking rather frail (Buck at the time was sick with lung cancer) and struggling to maintain his composure (Buck was obviously showing the signs of Parkinson's disease as well), Buck stirred emotions by reading a patriotic-themed poem during the pregame ceremonies.

Stevenson had supported John Tower in the 1960 senatorial general election against Johnson and was backing Goldwater in 1964 {{as well in the}} presidential contest. Stevenson told Crichton that the election [...] "is an important part of American history, for it got Lyndon to the Senate, which he later controlled, and was a stepping stone to his becoming President. <b>As</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> I was depressed for quite a while, but in retrospect it has allowed me to enjoy my ranch and my young daughter.

2500|$|Haussmann {{himself did}} not deny the {{military}} value of the wider streets. In his Memoires, he wrote that his new boulevard Sebastopol resulted in the [...] "gutting of old Paris, of the quarter of riots and barricades." [...] He admitted he sometimes used this argument with the parliament to justify {{the high cost of}} his projects, arguing that they were for national defense and should be paid for, at least partially, by the state. He wrote: [...] "But, <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> I who was the promoter of these additions made to original project, I declare that I never thought in the least, in adding them, of their greater or lesser strategic value." [...] The Paris urban historian Patrice de Moncan wrote: [...] "To see the works created by Haussmann and Napoleon III only from the perspective of their strategic value is very reductive. The Emperor was a convinced follower of Saint-Simon. His desire to make Paris, the economic capital of France, a more open, more healthy city, not only for the upper classes but also for the workers, cannot be denied, and should be recognised as the primary motivation." ...|$|E
2500|$|The False Dmitry {{is one of}} {{the primary}} {{characters}} in Alexander Pushkin's blank verse drama Boris Godunov. In Pushkin's drama, the character is a young novice monk who decides to impersonate the Tsarevich when he hears they would have been the same age had the child lived. Pushkin's decision to humanise the False Dmitry earned him the disapproval of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia, who then prevented the play from being published or staged. In an unpublished foreword, Pushkin wrote, [...] "There is much of Henri IV in Dmitri. Like him he is brave, generous and boastful, like him indifferent to religion -- both abjure their faith for a political cause, both love pleasures and war, both devote themselves to chimerical projects, both are victims of conspiracies... But Henri IV didn't have a Ksenya on his conscience -- it is true that this horrible accusation hasn't been proved and, <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> I make a point of not believing it." [...] Pushkin intended to write further plays about the reigns of Dmitry and Vasili, as well as the subsequent Time of Troubles. Pushkin was prevented from fulfilling these plans by his death in a duel at the age of 37.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the course}} of the 1990s, Jack Buck decided to reduce his {{schedule}} to calling only Cardinals home games (or 81 games a year unless there was a special occurrence). Health concerns obviously could have played a factor in this, as Buck suffered from such ailments as Parkinson's disease, diabetes, requiring a pacemaker, cataracts, sciatica, and vertigo. Buck once joked, [...] "I wish I'd get Alzheimer's, then I could forget I've got all the other stuff." [...] In 1998, the Cardinals dedicated a bust of Buck that showed him smiling with a hand cupping his left ear. In 1999, he lent his name to a restaurant venture called J. Buck's, with the restaurant's name being shared with son Joe and daughter Julie. One of Buck's final public appearances was on September 17, 2001 at Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis. It was the first night that Major League Baseball resumed after the terrorist attacks of September 11. Although looking rather frail (Buck at the time was sick with lung cancer) and struggling to maintain his composure (Buck was obviously showing the signs of Parkinson's disease as well), Buck stirred emotions by reading a patriotic-themed poem during the pregame ceremonies. He concluded by silencing critics who thought baseball had come back too soon: [...] "I don't know about you, but <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> the question has already been answered: Should we be here? Yes!" [...] Jack Buck died on June 18, 2002, in St. Louis's Barnes-Jewish Hospital from a combination of illnesses. He had stayed in the hospital since January 3 of that year to undergo treatment for lung cancer, Parkinson's disease, and to correct an intestinal blockage.|$|E
2500|$|Bezabeh's {{attempt to}} raise an army against Menelik failed; {{thousands}} of Shewans rallied {{to the flag}} of the son of Negus Haile Melekot and even Bezabeh's own soldiers deserted him for the returning prince. Abeto Menelik entered Ankober and proclaimed himself Negus. While Negus Menelik reclaimed his ancestral Shewan crown, he also laid claim to the Imperial throne, as a direct descendant male line of Emperor Lebna Dengel. However, he made no overt attempt to assert this claim at this time; Marcus interprets his lack of decisive action not only to Menelik's lack of confidence and experience, but that [...] "he was emotionally incapable of helping to destroy the man who had treated him as a son." [...] Not wishing {{to take part in the}} 1868 Expedition to Abyssinia, he allowed his rival Kassai to benefit with gifts of modern weapons and supplies from the British. When Tewodros committed suicide, Menelik arranged for an official celebration of his death even though he was personally saddened by the loss. When the British asked him why he did this, he replied [...] "to satisfy the passions of the people ... <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> I should have gone into a forest to weep over ... untimely death ... I have now lost the one who educated me, and toward whom I had always cherished filial and sincere affection." [...] Afterwards other challenges – a revolt amongst the Wollo to the north, the intrigues of his second wife Befana to replace him with her choice of ruler, military failures against the Arsi Oromo to the south east – kept Menelik from directly confronting Kassai until after his rival had brought an Abuna from Egypt who crowned him Emperor Yohannes IV.|$|E
