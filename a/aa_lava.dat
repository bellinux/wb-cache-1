5|$|The Mauna Ulu {{eruption}} of Kīlauea began on May 24, 1969, and ended on July 22, 1974. At the time, Mauna Ulu {{was the longest}} flank {{eruption of}} any Hawaiian volcano in recorded history. The eruption created a new vent, covered a large area of land with lava, and added new land to the island. The eruption started as a fissure between two pit craters, Āloi and Alae, where the Mauna Ulu shield would eventually form. Both pāhoehoe and <b>aā</b> <b>lava</b> erupted from the volcano. Early on, fountains of lava burst {{out as much as}} 540meters (1772ft) high. In early 1973, an earthquake occurred that caused Kīlauea to briefly stop erupting near the original Mauna Ulu site and instead erupt near the craters Pauahi and Hiiaka.|$|E

Eight primary volcanic and six sedimentary lithofacies have been identified, {{and they are}} organised into at least five different sequence architectures {{as a consequence of}} different combinations of eruptive and/or depositional conditions. The volcanoes were erupted in association with a Miocene glacial cover and the sequences are overwhelmingly glaciovolcanic. The commonest and most representative are products of mafic aa lava-fed deltas, a type of glaciovolcanic sequence that has not been described before. It is distinguished by (1) a subaerially emplaced relatively thin caprock of <b>aa</b> <b>lavas</b> lying on and passing down-dip into (2) a thicker association of chaotic to crudely bedded hyaloclastite breccias, water-chilled lava sheets and irregular lava masses, collectively called lobe-hyaloclastite.

Other sequence types in the HVP are minor and include tuff cones, cinder cones and a single ice-marginal lacustrine sequence.

40|$|The {{solidified}} {{surface of}} a lava flow reflects the viscosity of its molten fraction and the crystal content during flow; crystal-poor basaltic lavas produce pahoehoe fields, whereas crystal-rich ones solidify with aa carapaces. At Mount Etna, volcano aa morphologies are very common, whereas pahoehoe lavas are rare. The latter are locally named “cicirara” due {{to the presence of}} centimeter-sized plagioclase phenocrysts much more abundant than in <b>aa</b> <b>lavas.</b> The phenocryst content of “cicirara” lavas contrasts with the low viscosity generally associated with pahoehoe morphology. Therefore, to reconcile the discrepancy between textural and volcanic observations, we have studied the most primitive pahoehoe “cicirara” lava sampled until now. Two samples at 0. 5 and 1 m {{from the bottom of the}} 2 - m thick lava flow were investigated on the basis of their mineral compositional variations and textural features, i. e., size frequency and crystal size distribution (CSD). Results coupled with rheological models indicate that only large phenocrysts of plagioclase (> 1 mm) and clinopyroxene have grown before eruption. Thermobarometric models and petrological computations based on the composition of plagioclase and clinopyroxene phenocryst cores highlight that only a small amount (10 – 15 vol. %) of crystals equilibrated at 12 km of depth. Cumulative size frequency and CSD data also indicate that plagioclase and clinopyroxene phenocryst rims grew heterogeneously and coalesced around their cores at depths < 1 km, before eruption. In this view, the “cicirara” lava was erupted with a low crystalline content that favoured the formation of its pahoehoe surface; however, crystals with a size < 1 mm (~ 75 vol. %) solidified at post-eruptive conditions. Our findings underline that the emplacement of high-viscosity aa or low-viscosity pahoehoe lavas is driven by the degree of undercooling imposed by the volatile exsolution rate in the shallowest portion of the Etnean plumbing system. A slow magma ascent rate promotes significant intratelluric degassing and widespread nucleation; consequently, the viscosity of the suspension significantly increases leading to an aa morphology. In contrast, pahoehoe “cicirara” lavas are associated with a rapid rise to the surface of poorly degassed, undercooled magmas...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstract A clear {{model of}} {{structures}} and associated stress fields of a volcano {{can provide a}} framework in which to study and monitor activity. We propose a volcano-tectonic model for {{the dynamics of the}} summit of Piton de la Fournaise (La Reunion Island, Indian Ocean). The summit contains two main pit crater structures (Dolomieu and Bory), two active rift zones, and a slumping eastern sector, all of which contribute to the actual fracture system. Dolomieu has developed over 100 years by sudden large collapse events and subsequent smaller drops that include terrace formation. Small intra-pit collapse scars and eruptive fissures are located along the southern floor of Dolomieu. The western pit wall of Dolomieu has a superficial inward dipping normal fault boundary connected to a deeper ring fault system. Outside Dolomieu, an oval extension zone containing sub-parallel pit-related fractures extends to a maximum distance of 225 m from the pit. At the summit the main trend for eruptive fissures is N 80 °, normal to the north-south rift zone. The terraced structure of Dolomieu has been reproduced by analogue models with a roof to width ratio of approximately 1, suggesting an original magma chamber depth of about 1 km. Such a chamber may continue to act as a storage location today. The east flank has a convex-concave profile and is bounded by strike-slip fractures that define a gravity slump. This zone is bound to the north by strike-slip fractures that may delineate a shear zone. The southern reciprocal shear zone is probably marked by an alignment of large scoria cones and is hidden by recent <b>aa</b> <b>lavas.</b> The slump head intersects Dolomieu pit and may slide on a hydrothermally altered layer known to be located at a depth of around 300 m. Our model has the summit activity controlled by the pit crater collapse structure, not the rifts. The rifts become important on the mid-flanks of the cone, away from pit-related fractures. On the east flank the superficial structures are controlled by the slump. We suggest that during pit subsidence intra-pit eruptions may occur. During tumescence, however, the pit system may become blocked and a flank eruption is more likely. Intrusions along the rift may cause deformation that subsequently increases the slump's potential to deform. Conversely, slumping may influence the east flank stress distribution and locally control intrusion direction. These predictions can be tested with monitoring data to validate the model and, eventually, improve monitoring...|$|R

40|$|Lava flowfields {{consist of}} one or more flows. Four ideal {{emplacement}} regimes are recognized: that for single flows and that for flowfields dominated by (1) widening, (2) thickening, or (3) lengthening, as a result of generating new flows. Most <b>aa</b> and blocky <b>lavas</b> belong to the flowfield widening or single-flow regimes. These two regimes are analyzed assuming advance is controlled by the distal core of a flow, where motion is treated as steady, uniform, and laminar. Because of low deformation rates, the distal core is also approximated to a Newtonian fluid. Widening and, possibly, lengthening are ultimately limited by crustal resistance. After a critical cooling interval, new flows are generated from {{the upper reaches of the}} flowfield. A simple relation is derived linking flowfield dimensions and underlying slope to eruption duration, independent of terms involving gravity or lava chemistry and rheology. The relation well describes field data from several volcanoes (involving lava compositions from K phonolitic tephrite to dacite).

40|$|Detailed {{mapping of}} {{volcanic}} stratigraphy {{in conjunction with}} 41 new K-Ar ages {{have been used to}} constrain a petrological model of Tongariro Volcanic Complex within a time-space framework. Over 400 samples form an extensive geochemical data base comprising whole-rock major and trace element data, together with whole-rock REE and isotopic analyses and mineral compositions for selected samples. These data have been used to investigate the complex interplay between magma batches on a variety of time scales and the time-space relationships of the subvolcanic plumbing system. This new integrated approach to the study of Tongariro has not been applied to many other composite volcanoes but is crucial in linking petrological models to realistic geological relationships. Tongariro is a large (c. 60 km 3), active, basaltic andesite to dacite composite cone complex situated near {{the southern end of the}} Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand. A virtually continuous eruptive history of the Tongariro complex has been divided into 17 small (< 2 km 3) to large (12 km 3) nested and overlapping volcano-stratigraphic or cone-forming units which represent the products (<b>aa</b> and block <b>lava</b> flows, welded scoria-spatter deposits, volcaniclastic tuff breccias) of many recurrent styles of eruptions from at least 30 discrete vents, active for varying periods of time (a few to tens of thousands of years) throughout Tongariro's known lifetime from c. 275 ka to the present. Episodes of rapid cone growth have occurred at 210 - 200 ka (Tama 2 cone eruptive rate = 1 km 3 /ka) and 130 - 80 ka (NE Oturere, SW Oturere and Tongariro Trig cones under construction), with development of the complex most recently dominated by the rapid growth (0. 9 km 3 /ka) of Ngauruhoe cone since 2. 5 ka. There is no orderly time-space relationship between cone-building events; the locus of activity shifted non-systematically over the lifetime of the complex within a 13 km-long and 5 km-wide SW-NE aligned vent corridor. Tongariro eruptive products vary in composition almost continuously from 53. 0 to 64. 2 wt% SiO 2 and 1. 1 to 9. 2 wt% MgO, forming a calc-alkaline, medium-K suite. Two-pyroxene andesites are volumetrically dominant, but hornblende is a significant phase confined to the older southern cones of Tama 1 and 2 and Pukekaikiore, and olivine is particularly prominent in the young (post- 25 ka) eruptives, suggesting an overall time-space relationship with petrography and mineralogy. Tongariro rocks exhibit features typical of subduction-related magmas such as light-REE enriched patterns ([Ce/Yb]N= 1. 8 - 3. 9), relatively low high field strength abundances (e. g. Nb= 2. 7 - 6. 7), and strongly spiked patterns on incompatible element spider diagrams. A wide range in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr (0. 704442 - 0. 706193) is accompanied by less variability in 143 Nd/ 144 Nd (0. 512629 - 0. 512862), Pb isotopic ratios (206 Pb/ 204 Pb= 18. 781 - 18. 854, 207 Pb/ 204 Pb= 15. 594 - 15. 645, 208 Pb/ 204 Pb= 3 8. 5 88 - 38. 802), and δ 18 O (+ 6. 16 - 6. 59). Variation diagrams for the Tongariro cone-forming units reveal major diversity in the absolute elemental abundances for given SiO 2 contents, in the length, steepness and shape of chemical trends, and in the distribution of chemical groups within compositional space. However, certain volcano-stratigraphic units (e. g. the amphibole-bearing andesites of the older southern cones) do share similar patterns of chemical ordering which suggest derivation from a common 'parental' magma reservoir and a similar early history. Nonetheless, considerable chemical variability in closely-related samples is common, and provides strong evidence for a higher level influence on magma compositions. Nonsystematic relationships with age (compositional breaks, reversals and loops) along geoche mical trends on variation diagrams and chemical stratigraphy plots cannot be modelled by fractional crystallization. These coincide with petrographic and mineralogical evidence for disequilibrium including plagioclase sieve textures, strong reverse zoning, coexisting high-temperature and low-temperature phases exhibiting reaction rims or corrosion, olivine phenocrysts with much higher Fo contents than expected from wholerock Mg#, and bimodal or very widely ranging crystallization temperature estimates for some samples. These features suggest the involvement of multiple small batches of magma, rising from the various 'parental' reservoirs by differing ascent paths, within a complex subvolcanic plumbing system which has allowed varying degrees of interaction and magma mixing. As indicated by the presence of quartzite xenoliths of the Torlesse metasedimentary basement, these magmas have also interacted with the crust, which represents an important means of introducing often wide compositional diversity of magmas on time scales as short as decades or centuries. A considerable variation in incompatible trace element ratios (e. g. Ba/Zr, Nb/Ta, La/Yb, Zr/Hf) and radiogenic isotopic compositions (e. g. Ngauruhoe 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios increase from 0. 705470 in 1954 to 0. 706165 in 1975) for closely-related samples, and the marked scatter of data evident on assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) process diagrams indicate that magmas have not evolved along a unique AFC trend but can more aptly be characterised as forming a 'family' of AFC trends or perhaps a series of 'one-off AFC 'events' produced by contamination of numerous small and frequent Tongariro magma batches with varying amounts of compositionally heterogeneous Torlesse crust. This investigation of chemically and isotopically diverse lavas related on time scales of 100 years (historic Ngauruhoe eruptives), 1000 years (Ngauruhoe, Red Crater and Te Mari Crater vents) and 10 000 years (0 - 10 ka young eruptives, 120 - 130 ka NE Oturere, 200 - 210 ka Tama 2) has demonstrated that the observed compositional variability is mainly developed at comparatively high crustal levels within a complex subvolcanic plumbing system by fractional crystallization and the mixing of numerous, small (<< 0. 1 km 3), short-lived (c. 1 ka) magma batches coupled with variable amounts of crustal assimilation of a compositionally diverse Torlesse metasedimentary contaminant. These processes have been operating to similar effect throughout the lifetime of the Tongariro complex, although subtle differences in geochemical patterns suggest that the regularity or rate of magma batch production may have varied slightly. The young Ngauruhoe cone has been highlighted as a cameo study for which the well-constrained stratigraphy, enabled by the preservation of numerous young lava flows erupted over the last thousand years, provides a unique opportunity for detailed petrological modelling paying careful attention to age relationships. Five geochemically and isotopically distinct groups of magma reflect variable crustal contamination of many discrete magma batches within several independent shallow plumbing systems beneath Ngauruhoe...|$|R
