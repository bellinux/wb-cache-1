5|$|Moisture {{from the}} {{remnants}} of Nora and Olaf interacted with an upper-level low to produce heavy rainfall across Texas, producing flooding near Waco that forced <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>to</b> evacuate in McGregor. The floodwaters closed portions of Interstate 35, U.S. Route 84, and Texas State Highway 36. The system also spawned a tornado in Sugar Land that damaged four buildings, including a school.|$|E
5|$|Nash did not rush {{to enlist}} in the Australian armed forces on the {{outbreak}} of war in 1939. While there was no public statement from Nash, {{it is thought that}} with <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>to</b> support and an Irish Catholic anti-pathy to the British, Nash did not feel an urgency to fight. However, following the commencement of the war against Japan, Nash enlisted on 2 February 1942.|$|E

5|$|On the upland farms of Wales, Welsh ponies and cobs {{would often}} have to do {{everything}} from ploughing a field to carrying a farmer to market or driving <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>to</b> services on Sunday. When coal mining became important to the economy of England, many Welsh ponies were harnessed for use in mines, above and below ground.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people with}} TS {{may not realize}} they have tics; because tics are more {{commonly}} expressed in private, TS may go unrecognized or undetected. It {{is not uncommon for}} the parents of affected children to be unaware that they, too, may have had tics as children. Because Tourette's tends to subside with maturity, and because milder cases of Tourette's are now more likely to be recognized, the first realization that a parent had tics as a child may not come until their offspring is diagnosed. It is not uncommon for several members of <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>to</b> be diagnosed together, as parents bringing children to a physician for an evaluation of tics become aware that they, too, had tics as a child.|$|E
5|$|Olaf {{was a part}} of a {{rainy year}} in Mexico, {{producing}} more rain than Hurricane Nora. Although no deaths were reported, flooding caused serve damage to roadways and crops in the Mexican state of Jalisco. In the same state, more than 12,000 homes were damaged. In the state of Guanajuato, an estimated total of 15,000 people were impacted from the floods. In addition, two communities were isolated. After the hurricane, a program wanted donation from food to basic home supplies. Moisture from the remnants of Nora and Olaf interacted with an upper-level low to produce heavy rainfall across Texas, producing flooding near Waco that forced <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>to</b> evacuate in McGregor. The floodwaters closed portions of Interstate 35, U.S. Route 84, and Texas State Highway 36. It also spawned a tornado in Sugar Land that damaged four buildings, including a school.|$|E

5|$|The plot {{revolves}} around the lives of three close friends: Keong (Jack Neo), a spendthrift white-collar worker, Ong (Mark Lee), a general contractor, and Hui (Henry Thia), a kopi tiam waiter. After an argument with his boss (Chen Zhao Jin), Keong quits his job and is unable to get another due to his poor command of English, lack of academic qualifications and computer illiteracy. With bills (especially instalments) to pay and <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>to</b> support, he goes heavily into debt whereupon his wife leaves him, taking their daughter with her. Ong borrows S$40,000 from loan sharks, and plans to repay them after collecting a debt owed him by a friend who subsequently runs away. The loan sharks beat up Ong for not repaying the loan within the two-week deadline, so he flees to Johor Bahru. Hui, who is single and lives with his elderly mother, wastes his meagre salary on 4D and pursuing an insurance agent who he has a crush on.|$|E
5|$|They had {{submitted}} to three reductions of wages in three years; {{that they would}} have acquiesced in a moderate reduction; that they were frequently sent out on a trip to Martinsburg, and there detained four days at the discretion of the company, for which detention they were allowed pay but two day's time; that they were compelled to pay their board during the time they were detained, which was more than the wages they received; that they had nothing left with which to support their families; that {{it was a question of}} bread with them; that when times were dull on the road they could not get more than fifteen day's work in a month; that many sober, steady economical men became involved in debt last winter; that honest men had their wages attached because they could not meet their expenses; that by a rule of the company any man who had his wages attached should be discharged; that this was a tyranny to which no rational being should submit, and that it was utterly impossible for a man with <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>to</b> support himself and family at the reduced rate of wages.|$|E

25|$|Before {{being sent}} off to road camps, sugar beet farms or prisoner-of-war camps, many Japanese-Canadian men and {{families}} were processed through Hastings Park in Vancouver, BC.

25|$|Stockpots {{are large}} pots with sides {{at least as}} tall as their diameter. This allows stock to simmer for {{extended}} periods of time without reducing too much. Stockpots are typically measured in volume (6-36 l). Stock pots come in a large variety of sizes to meet any need from cooking for <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>to</b> preparing food for a banquet. A specific type of stockpot exists for lobsters, and an all-metal stockpot usually called a caldero is used in Hispanic cultures to cook rice.|$|E
25|$|Status {{in early}} Ireland {{was not entirely}} rigid and it was {{possible}} for <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>to</b> raise its status. If three consecutive generations—grandfather, father, and son—had the property qualifications of a lord, or the poetic qualifications of a higher level poet, etc., then the member of the third generation became a lord. On the other hand, the son or grandson of a lord, or a poet, etc., who did not have the proper qualifications, did not have that status. However, the grandson of a person with a certain status could have that status themselves, assuming they had the proper qualifications, even if their father did not.|$|E
25|$|With <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>to</b> support, Clerk {{struggled}} {{to live on}} his meagre £10 monthly stipend, and occasionally felt that he should seek a more lucrative post. Dr. Gruner, the German district commissioner at Misahohé, nearly 50 miles (80km) to the south {{in what is now}} the Republic of Togo, had heard of his plight, and in 1893 had written to him, offering him a permanent post in the civil service of the German administration with a starting monthly salary of 500 Deutsch marks. Nonetheless, Clerk once again refused to quit his Basel Mission job. Though he disliked the German way of treating Africans, and made them aware of it, he was still highly regarded by the Germans.|$|E

25|$|The Black Death ravaged Ireland 1348–49. One of {{the most}} vivid {{accounts}} of the plague was written by Friar John Clyn at Kilkenny, who thought that all mankind might die. He reports that particularly in the months of September and October, 1348, people came from all over Ireland to St. Mullins, County Carlow, including many no doubt from County Wexford, out of fear, to seek divine protection from the 'pestilence' {{as he calls it}} – as it was then very prevalent. He comments on how it was rare for only one member of <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>to</b> die, but that usually the entire family was wiped out. John Clyn himself is believed to have died in 1349 from the plague.|$|E
25|$|Polyandry is {{believed}} to be more likely in societies with scarce environmental resources, as it {{is believed}} to limit human population growth and enhance child survival. It is a rare form of marriage that exists not only among poor families, but also the elite. For example, in the Himalayan Mountains polyandry is related to the scarcity of land; the marriage of all brothers in <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>to</b> the same wife allows family land to remain intact and undivided. If every brother married separately and had children, family land would be split into unsustainable small plots. In Europe, this was prevented through the social practice of impartible inheritance (the disinheriting of most siblings, many of whom went on to become celibate monks and priests).|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} the subsidy given to <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>to</b> {{cover the cost of}} a premium is {{calculated}} using a formula that includes the family's income relative to the federal poverty level. The federal poverty level is related to a determined percentage that defines how much of that family's income can be put towards a health insurance premium. For instance, under the House Bill, a family at 200% of the federal poverty level will spend no more than 5.5% of its annual income on health insurance premiums. Under the Senate Bill, the same family would spend no more than 6.3% of its annual income on health insurance premiums. The difference between the family's maximum contribution to health insurance premiums and the cost of the health insurance premium is paid for by the federal government.|$|E
