50|$|Beagle 2 has {{a robotic}} arm {{known as the}} Payload Adjustable Workbench (PAW), {{designed}} to be extended after landing. The arm is 109 cm long when fully extended, and it can reach about 70 cm to the nearest rocks. The PAW contains a pair of stereo cameras, a microscope (with a 6 micrometre resolution), a Mössbauer spectrometer, an X-ray spectrometer, a drill for collecting rock samples and a <b>spot</b> <b>lamp.</b> Rock samples were to be passed by the PAW into a mass spectrometer and gas chromatograph {{in the body of}} the lander - the GAP (Gas Analysis Package), to measure the relative proportions of different isotopes of carbon and methane. Since carbon is thought to be the basis of all life, these readings could have revealed whether the samples contained the remnants of living organisms. Atmospheric methane is another signature of existing life, although geological processes can also be a source.|$|R

25|$|In March 1983 the Alfetta {{received}} its last facelift; the exterior was modernised with newly designed bumpers (integrating a front spoiler and extending {{to the wheel}} openings), a new grille, lower body plastic cladding, silver hubcaps and, at the rear, a full width grey plastic fascia supporting rectangular tail lights with ribbed lenses and the number plate. The C-pillar ventilation outlets were moved to {{each side of the}} rear screen. Inside there were a redesigned dashboard and instrumentation, new door panels and the check control panel from the Quadrifoglio Oro on all models. Top of the range models adopted an overhead console, which extended for the full length of the roof and housed three reading <b>spot</b> <b>lamps,</b> a central ceiling light, and controls for the electric windows. Alongside the facelift two new models were introduced: the 2.4 Turbo Diesel, which in most markets gradually replaced the previous 2.0-litre which was instead installed in the marginally smaller Giulietta. There was also a renewed two-liter Quadrifoglio Oro, equipped with electronic fuel injection. Thanks to the Bosch Motronic integrated electronic fuel injection and ignition the QO had the same 130PS output of the carburetted 2.0, while developing more torque and being more fuel efficient.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of spot {{lighting}} on performance and welfare in broiler production were investigated. The base performance criterions as body weight, feed conversion and mortality ratio organ weights were determined and also some visceral organ weights (bursa of Fabricius, spleen and liver), Tonic Immobility (TI) and gait score have been evaluated as welfare indicators. Day old chicks from a commercial hatchery divided into three group (n = 174) randomly one {{of them as a}} control and each experimental group separated into three subgroup (n = 58) make replications. In control groups 40 W filament bulbs were used as light source to provide approximately 10 lux light intensity {{on the bottom of the}} poultry house. In the each treatment groups, two halogen <b>spot</b> <b>lamps</b> were used to supply at different light intensities (10 + 10 vs. 10 + 5 lux) over two circular bottom spot of 1 m 2 diameter. Spot light (10 + 5 lux) has shown better (2297. 07 g) live weight than the control groups. Similarly this group shown significantly (p< 0. 05) higher weight or relative weight in bursa of fabricius than the other experimental groups. As a conclusion, spotlights might be useful tool for the dim light applications without negatively affecting the performance and welfare of broilers...|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} the present paper is the {{derivation}} of a merit function which predicts the visual perception of LED spot lights. The color uniformity level Usl is described by a linear regression function of the spatial color distribution in the far field. Hereby, the function is derived from four basic functions. They describe the color uniformity of spot lights through different features. The result is a reliable prediction for the perceived color uniformity in spot lights. A human factor experiment was performed to evaluate the visual preferences for colors and patterns. A perceived rank order {{was derived from the}} subjects’ answers and compared with the four basic functions. The correlation between the perceived rank order and the basic functions was calculated resulting in the definition of the merit function Usl. The application of this function is shown by a comparison of visual evaluations and measurements of LED retrofit <b>spot</b> <b>lamps.</b> The results enable a prediction of color uniformity levels of simulations and measurements concerning the visual perception. The function provides a possibility to evaluate the far field of spot lights without individual subjective judgment. © (2014) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to high-throughput Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) which enables us to obtain one order of magnitude improvement in acquisition time. Our approach utilizes a liquid crystal on silicon spatial light modulator to generate dynamically <b>adjustable</b> focal <b>spots,</b> and uses an eight-pixel monolithic single-photon avalanche photodiode array. We demonstrate the capabilities of this system by showing FCS of Rhodamine 6 G under various viscosities, and by showing that, with proper calibration of each detection channel, one order of magnitude improvement in acquisition speed is obtained. More generally, our approach will allow higher throughput single-molecule studies to be performed...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} {{it was to}} be shown whether dodecaborate cluster-containing {{polymers}} can have possible applications as polymer electrolyte membranes in fuel cells. There are two possibilities to prepare membranes containing dodecahydro-closo-dodecaborate (2 -). On the one hand by polymerization of boron cluster-containing monomers to linear, branched or cross-linked polymers. Or on the other hand by substitution of existing membranes such as Nafion with the B 12 -cluster. It was possible to synthesize a variety of monomers with a [B 12 H 11] 2 - moiety, which some could be polymerized successfully. Radical homo-, co- and photo polymerizations were not successful with boron cluster monomers. Only the photo polymerization of the acrylic acid derivative in the NMR experiment was successful, which might be due to the used <b>Spot</b> <b>Lamps.</b> Cationic polymerizations were also not successful. Also hydrosilylations were no suitable polymerizations for boron cluster-containing monomers. Polycondensation reactions with B 12 H 11 monomers were promising. The reaction of dihydroxybenzylammonioundecahydro-closo-dodecaborate with decafluorobiphenyl showed no starting material in the MS, instead it shows a triply negatively charged peak with a yet unknown structure. With the ring-opening metathesis polymerization bis-norbornene derivatives of the dodecaborate cluster could not be polymerized. However, the mono norbornene derivatives of B 12 H 12 (2 -) formed insoluble swelling polymers in the homo- and copolymerization with dicyclopentadiene and Grubbs 2 nd Generation catalysts. Another method to produce a boron cluster-containing polymer is the substitution of Nafion with the boron cluster. From the obtained polymers, films can be produced, which, however, have no better thermal stability than the pure Nafion membrane. However, investigations whether they are suitable as a membrane material must still be carried out...|$|R
40|$|A model named {{modified}} hollow Gaussian beam (HGB) {{is proposed}} {{to describe a}} dark hollow beam with <b>adjustable</b> beam <b>spot</b> size, central dark size and darkness factor. In this modified model, both the beam spot size and the central dark size will be convergent to finite constants as the beam order approaches infinity, which are much {{different from that of}} the previous unmodified model, where the beam spot size and the central dark size will not be convergent as the beam order approaches infinity. The dependences of the propagation factor of modified and unmodified HGBs on the beam order are found to be the same. Based on the Collins integral, analytical formulas for the modified HGB propagating through aligned and misaligned optical system are derived. Some numerical examples are given. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.
