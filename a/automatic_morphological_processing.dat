This treebank consists of gold standard sentences where part-of-speech tags are manually assigned to each word and the words forming multi word expressions are also manually determined and combined into single units. For the first time, we investigate the results of parsing Turkish sentences from scratch and observe the accuracy drop {{at the end of}} processing raw data. We test one state-of-the art morphological analyzer together with two different morphological disambiguators. We both show separately the accuracy drop due to the <b>automatic</b> <b>morphological</b> <b>processing</b> and to the lack of multi word unit extraction.

40|$|Morphological {{decomposition}} is {{an important}} part of complex word processing and the left inferior frontal gyrus (L-IFG) has been shown to be a key brain area involved in <b>morphological</b> <b>processing</b> in alphabetic languages. Chinese <b>morphological</b> <b>processing</b> requires a comprehensive consideration of phonological, orthographic and morphemic information. But it had been unclear whether the neural mechanisms underlying <b>morphological</b> <b>processing</b> in alphabetic languages would also be found for Chinese.

METHOD - A total of 78 Chinese junior secondary school students, 26 dyslexics, 26 chronological age (CA) and 26 reading level (RL) controls, participated and were administered measures of IQ, word reading, reading comprehension, verbal working memory, vocabulary knowledge, syntactic and <b>morphological</b> <b>processing</b> skills.

40|$|Two novel {{methods for}} surface profile {{extraction}} based on multiple ultrasonic range measurements are described and compared. One {{of the methods}} employs <b>morphological</b> <b>processing</b> techniques, whereas the other employs a spatial voting scheme followed by simple thresholding. <b>Morphological</b> <b>processing</b> exploits neighbouring relationships between the pixels of the generated are map. On the other hand, spatial voting relies {{on the number of}} votes accumulated in each pixel and ignores neighbouring relationships. Both approaches are extremely flexible and robust, in addition to being simple and straightforward. They can deal with arbitrary numbers and configurations of sensors as well as synthetic arrays. The methods have the intrinsic ability to suppress spurious readings, crosstalk and higher-order reflections, and process multiple reflections informatively. The performances of the two methods are compared on various examples involving both simulated and experimental data. The <b>morphological</b> <b>processing</b> method outperforms the spatial voting method in most cases with errors reduced by up to 80 %.

40|$|While most of {{the speech}} and natural {{language}} systems which were developed for English and other Indo-European languages neglect the <b>morphological</b> <b>processing</b> and integrate speech and natural language at the word level, for the agglutinative languages such as Korean and Japanese, the <b>morphological</b> <b>processing</b> {{plays a major role}} in the language processing since these languages have very complex morphological phenomena and relatively simple syntactic functionality. Obviously degenerated <b>morphological</b> <b>processing</b> limits the usable vocabulary size for the system and word-level dictionary results in exponential explosion in the number of dictionary entries. For the agglutinative languages, we need sub-word level integration which leaves rooms for general <b>morphological</b> <b>processing.</b> In this paper, we developed a phoneme-level integration model of speech and linguistic <b>processings</b> through general <b>morphological</b> analysis for agglutinative languages and a efficient parsing scheme for that integration.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the relationship between morphological awareness and <b>morphological</b> <b>processing</b> and reading in Brazilian−Portuguese.

40|$|The present {{research}} examined whether morphology influences word recognition independently of form-level word properties. Prevailing views attribute cross-linguistic differences in <b>morphological</b> <b>processing</b> to variations in morphological structure and/or productivity. This study tested whether <b>morphological</b> <b>processing</b> is additionally {{influenced by the}} orthographic depth of written language, by comparing primed word naming among biliterate readers of Hindu and Urdu, languages written in distinct orthographies but sharing a common morphophonology. Results from five experiments supported the view that <b>morphological</b> <b>processing</b> in orthographically shallow (transparent) Hindi script diverged significantly from that in the deeper (opaque) Urdu orthography. Specifically, morphological priming was differently affected in Hindi vs. Urdu by prim presentation conditions (Exps. 1 - 3) : very briefly exposed (48 ms), forward masked morphological primes facilitated word naming in Hindi but not in Urdu. Neither briefly presented, unmasked primes nor longer prime exposures (80 ms/ 240 ms) produced priming in Hindi, but Experiment 2 showed priming by unmasked Hindi primes at a 240 ms exposure. By contrast, Urdu exhibited morphological priming only for forward masked primes at the long exposure of 240 ms. Thus, early-onset priming in Hindi resembled morpho-orthographic decomposition previously recorded in English, whereas Urdu evinced priming consistent with morpho-semantic effects documented across several languages. Hemispheric asymmetry in morphological priming also diverged across Hindi and Urdu (Exps. 4 and 5); Hindi revealed a non-significant numerical trend for facilitation by morphological primes only in the right visual field (RVF), whereas reliable morphological priming in Urdu was limited to left visual field (LVF) presentation. Disparate patterns in <b>morphological</b> <b>processing</b> asymmetry were corroborated by differences in baseline visual field asymmetries in Hindi vs. Urdu word recognition- filler words elicited a consistent RVF advantage in Hindi, whereas in Urdu, one-syllable fillers, but not two- and three-syllable words revealed the RVF advantage. Taken together, {{the findings suggest that}} the variable of orthographic depth be integrated more explicitly into mainstream theoretical accounts of the mechanisms underlying <b>morphological</b> <b>processing</b> in word recognition. In addition, this study highlights the psycholinguistic potential of the languages Hindi and Urdu for advancing our understanding of the role of orthography as well as phonology in <b>morphological</b> <b>processing...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} of how morphologically complex words (assign-ment, listen-ed) are represented and processed in the brain {{has been one of}} the most hotly debated topics in the cognitive neuroscience of language. Do complex words engage cortical representations and processes equivalent to single lexical objects or are they processed as sequences of separate morpheme-like units? Research on <b>morphological</b> <b>processing</b> has suggested that adults make efficient use of both lexical (i. e., whole word) storage and retrieval, as well as combinatorial computation in processing morphologically complex words. Psycholinguistic studies have demonstrated that processing of complex words can be affected both by properties of the morphemes and the whole words, such as their frequency, transparency, and regularity. Furthermore, this research has been informative about the time-course of complex word recognition and production, and the role of morphological structure in these processes. At the neural level, left-hemisphere inferior frontal and superior temporal areas, and negative-going event-related potentials, have been consistently associated with <b>morphological</b> <b>processing.</b> While most previous research has been done on the recognition of morphologically complex words in adult native speakers, much less is known about neurocognitive processes involved in the on-line production of morphologically complex words, and even less on <b>morphological</b> <b>processing</b> in children and non-native speakers. Moreover, we have limited understanding of how linguistically distinct morphological processes, e. g. inflectional (listen-ed) versus derivational (assign-ment), are handled by the cortical language networks.
