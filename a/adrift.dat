5|$|August 30, 1839– A {{hurricane}} {{that remains}} offshore {{of the state}} forced the floating light in Sandy Hook to break loose and set <b>adrift.</b>|$|E
5|$|A call {{like this}} might be a bit ambiguous, but it was unsettling to those who were {{on the side of the}} status quo. Yiddish theater was banned in Russia {{starting}} September 14, 1883, as part of the anti-Jewish reaction following the assassination of Czar Alexander II. Goldfaden and his troupe were left <b>adrift</b> in Saint Petersburg. They headed various directions, some to England, some to New York City, some to Poland, some to Romania.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the race, Nico Rosberg {{manifested}} his lead {{at the top of the}} drivers' standings, having collected the maximum available 50 points from the first two races. Teammate Hamilton was in second place, 17 points behind Rosberg, with Ricciardo in third another nine points <b>adrift.</b> In the Constructors' Championship, Mercedes retained the lead with 83 points, 50 points ahead of Ferrari, while Red Bull in third was another three points behind.|$|E
5|$|At about 13:15, an {{air attack}} by German Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters and Junkers Ju 88 bombers sank both destroyers within minutes. Wryneck {{launched}} her whaler, and each destroyer launched her three Carley floats. Survivors in the whaler set off east past Cape Maleas, towing two Carley floats and their occupants. In the evening the wind increased, causing the floats {{to strike the}} boat, so Waldron reluctantly cast them <b>adrift.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cushing patrolled off the Irish coast, {{meeting and}} escorting convoys of {{merchant}} ships and troop transports to British ports and the French coast. German submarines {{were active in}} the area and Cushing conducted antisubmarine patrols and performed rescue work on the ships that were victims of U-boats. On 4 June, she picked up 13 men <b>adrift</b> in a small boat, survivors of Italian brig Luisa.|$|E
5|$|In November 2005, Gannon was {{appointed}} {{as director of}} Stockport County's centre of excellence for girls. After the resignation of Chris Turner as Stockport County manager on Boxing Day 2005, Gannon {{was appointed}} as caretaker manager with the team nine points <b>adrift</b> of safety {{at the bottom of}} League Two, facing potential relegation from the Football League.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the race, Lewis Hamilton {{was leading}} the World Championship on 227 points, 28 clear of {{teammate}} Rosberg. Sebastian Vettel was in third place, another 39 points <b>adrift.</b> In the Constructors' standings, Mercedes were in front on 426 points, with Ferrari and Williams second and third on 242 and 161 points respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} advertised to the American churchgoer {{as a moral}} picture. The film was {{generally}} well received by critics, but the faults of story {{for the sake of}} a moral lesson was noted. <b>Adrift,</b> like all other American silents of the day, had no musical accompaniment, but a letter written into a trade publication provides a score for the drama. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The storm made {{launching}} the lifeboats almost impossible. At about 3:00am, Captain Pearce ordered the two port lifeboats lowered, each with four crew on board. While being passed astern {{one of the}} boats broke the painter and became <b>adrift.</b> Her crew tried hard to {{pull up to the}} ship's side, but it was impossible in the heavy squall. The other was accidentally let go and both boats, in heavy seas, were unable to be retrieved.|$|E
5|$|A six issue {{spin-off}} comic miniseries titled Marceline and the Scream Queens, {{written by}} Meredith Gran of Octopus Pie, debuted in July 2012. The series featured Marceline and Princess Bubblegum forming a band and touring around Ooo. The series {{is published by}} Boom!

KaBoom has also published Seeing Red by Kate Leth, and Marceline Gone <b>Adrift</b> by Gran.|$|E
5|$|As {{the wave}} {{breaches}} the Himalayas and approaches the site, an impact driver lodges in the ark-door gears, keeping a boarding gate open and preventing the ship's engines from starting. In the ensuing chaos where many people attempt {{to board the}} ships, Yuri, Tamara and Gordon are killed, Tenzin is injured, Ark 4 begins filling with water and is set <b>adrift</b> after Air Force One crashes into one of its supports, while also causing it to skim the hull of Ark 6 before drifting off. With Jackson and Noah's help, {{the crew of the}} Ark manages to regain control of the Ark narrowly before it fatally smashes into Mount Everest.|$|E
5|$|Coming {{into the}} race from Monaco two weeks earlier, Lucas di Grassi (Audi Sport ABT) was leading the {{championship}} with 93 points, four ahead of his compatriot Nelson Piquet, Jr. (NEXTEV TCR). Another six points <b>adrift,</b> third placed Sébastien Buemi (e.dams Renault) was the only driver who scored two victories {{over the course of}} the season, but less consistent outings prevented him from placing higher up in the standings. In the teams' championship, e.dams Renault on 160 points had a 45-point lead over Audi Sport ABT.|$|E
5|$|Exact {{details of}} her death {{eventually}} came to light; she boarded a packed boat with 70 other people {{in an attempt to}} cross the Mediterranean Sea and reach Italy. The boat soon ran out of petrol and was <b>adrift</b> off the coast of Libya. When an Italian Navy vessel arrived to offer assistance, it threw ropes over the side to the refugees. In the chaos that ensued as people attempting to grab the ropes, Omar was knocked into the sea, where witnesses saw her treading water for a while, but eventually drowned.|$|E
5|$|George Harrison first {{worked with}} Genesis Publications on his 1980 autobiography, I Me Mine, for which his friend Derek Taylor served as editor and narrator. Harrison {{subsequently}} edited Taylor's memoir, Fifty Years <b>Adrift,</b> which Genesis published in its customary, limited-edition, deluxe format in 1984. That year, Brian Roylance, {{the owner of}} Genesis Publications, met a New Zealand-based botanical artist named Keith West, whose work Roylance considered might be suitable for a proposed illustrated book of Harrison's songs.|$|E
5|$|He was {{expected}} {{by some to}} mount a challenge for promotion to the Premiership in 2005–06, which was the club's first season in the new Ricoh Arena. The team started out poorly, but improved {{in the second half}} of the season to rise up the table, with Adams making an inspired signing in Dennis Wise. However, despite excellent home form, he could only guide Coventry as high as 8th, missing out on a play-off place by only two league places, though several points <b>adrift</b> of that year's standard.|$|E
5|$|In October 1915 {{pack ice}} in the Weddell Sea had sunk Endurance, leaving Shackleton and his companions <b>adrift</b> on a {{precarious}} ice surface. Throughout the duration of their survival, the group drifted northward until April 1916, when the floe on which they had encamped broke up. They then made their way in the ship's lifeboats to Elephant Island, where Shackleton decided that {{the most effective means}} of obtaining rescue would be to sail one of the lifeboats to South Georgia.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the storm, Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke promised {{residents}} of Borroloola that they would receive all possible help from the government. About 400 people in the town were left homeless by Cyclone Kathy. By 25March, a Royal Australian Air Force aircraft was sent to the region carrying emergency supplies for sheltering displaced persons. Two patrol boats from the Royal Australian Navy were also sent to assist in relief efforts. One brought fuel and medical supplies and the other assisted trawlers set <b>adrift</b> or grounded by the storm. Following its usage, the name Kathy was retired from Brisbane's list of cyclone names and will never be used again.|$|E
5|$|On 22 July 2016, the BBC {{reported}} that manager Bruce had resigned from his position. This was later {{confirmed by the}} club, which also announced that Mike Phelan would act as caretaker manager. On 13 October 2016, Phelan became Hull's permanent head coach. On 3 January 2017, Phelan was sacked by Hull City, {{less than three months}} after being made permanent. The decision was made following a 3–1 away defeat to West Bromwich Albion the previous day, leaving the Tigers bottom of the Premier League and three points <b>adrift</b> of safety.|$|E
5|$|Strong winds from Hurricane Dean caused {{considerable}} {{power line}} damage, leaving 65,000 residents without electricity. The winds also caused minor roof damage. In Hamilton Harbor, 20 pleasure boats were damaged or sent <b>adrift</b> {{due to the}} rough seas. Flooding from the hurricane damaged fifteen houses. Sixteen people were injured by the hurricane, five of the injuries were considered serious. There were, however, no reports of fatalities from Dean’s impact on Bermuda. Damage in Bermuda amounted up to $8.9million (1989USD, $ USD).|$|E
5|$|The Pirates Own Book and Ossian both {{suggest that}} Low was set <b>adrift</b> without {{provisions}} by {{the crew of}} the Merry Christmas, in a mutiny brought about by Low's murdering of a sleeping subordinate following an argument. His crew elected Captain Shipton to command the Merry Christmas; they would go on to sail alongside Spriggs in the Caribbean. Low was subsequently rescued by a French ship; when the French authorities learned of his identity he was brought to trial, and was hanged in Martinique in 1724.|$|E
5|$|The result meant Lotterer, Tréluyer and Fässler {{remained}} {{the leaders of}} the Drivers' Championship on 80 points, 20 ahead of Tandy, and a further two in front of his co-drivers Bamber and Hülkenberg. Dumas, Jani and Lieb dropped from second to fourth and Bernhard, Hartley and Webber stood in fifth place. Porsche became the new leaders of the Manufacturers' Championship with 140 points; Audi were 16 points behind their nearest rivals with Toyota 69 points <b>adrift</b> in third with five races left in the season.|$|E
5|$|The single reel drama was {{directed}} by Lucius J. Henderson. Henderson was an important director at the Thanhouser Company who began directing in the late autumn of 1910. It is unknown how many film's Henderson directed prior {{to the release of}} <b>Adrift,</b> but one prior credit When Love Was Blind was released two weeks prior, on January 24, 1911. The New York Dramatic Mirror on February 4, 1914, stated that Henderson had directed about 150 one and two reel dramas for the Thanhouser Company.|$|E
5|$|The {{victory was}} Alonso's {{fifth of the}} season; the result put him into {{the lead of the}} Drivers' Championship, eleven points ahead of Webber, who had dropped to second after failing to finish the race. Hamilton moved into third and Vettel's {{retirement}} meant he slipped to fourth. Jenson Button remained in fifth position. In the World Constructors' Championship, McLaren reduced the points deficit to Red Bull to be twenty-seven points behind. With two races of the season remaining, Ferrari was a further twenty-five points <b>adrift.</b>|$|E
5|$|To {{support her}} secret lover Dwight, Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) sabotages Andy, leaving him <b>adrift</b> {{in the lake}} in an {{inflatable}} sumo wrestling costume. Michael's final event is a walk across hot coals. Initially, only Pam volunteers, but Michael refuses to let her walk across because she is not being considered to replace him. However, Michael cannot even bring himself to do it. Dwight throws himself on the coals, refusing to leave until he is given the job, and he writhes in agony until he is dragged off.|$|E

5|$|Argyle {{lost three}} of their next nine matches to give {{themselves}} a chance of avoiding relegation, but their win at Doncaster Rovers {{proved to be the}} last game that they would collect any points in. Defeats at home to Middlesbrough and away to Watford left the club {{on the brink of a}} return to England's third tier, and that was confirmed in their next game. Newcastle United won 2–0 at Home Park to secure the Championship title, and relegated the home side at the same time. The club finished 23rd in the league table after defeat by bottom club Peterborough United on the final day of the season, eight points <b>adrift</b> of safety. Jamie Mackie finished as the club's top scorer with eight goals in all competitions, and captain Carl Fletcher was voted Player of the Year.|$|E
5|$|As a {{tropical}} storm, Beta produced heavy rains over northern Panama, amounting up to 3inches (76mm), which caused several mudslides {{as well as}} three fatalities. On October29, the storm passed over Providencia Island, caused significant damage to structures, and injured 30 people. In Honduras and Nicaragua, over 1,000 structures were damaged by the storm, hundreds of which were destroyed. Ten people were initially feared dead after their boat went <b>adrift</b> during the storm. However, a Panamanian vessel rescued the men after drifting in the water for several hours. Rains in Honduras totaled to 21.82in (554mm) and 6.39in (162mm) in Nicaragua. Six {{people were killed in}} Nicaragua {{as a result of the}} storm and the cost to repair damages exceeded 300million córdoba ($14.5million USD). Overall, Beta was responsible for nine fatalities and more than $15.5million in damage across four countries.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the attack, none aboard Centaur {{witnessed}} what had attacked the ship. Due to the ship's position, the distance from shore, and the depth, it was concluded that she was torpedoed by one of the Japanese submarines known to be operating off the Australian east coast. Several survivors later claimed to have heard the attacking submarine moving on the surface while they were <b>adrift,</b> and the submarine was seen by the ship's cook, Francis Martin, who was floating alone on a hatch cover, out of sight from the main cluster of survivors. Martin described the submarine to Naval Intelligence following the survivors' return to land; his description matched the profile of a KD7 type Kaidai-class submarine of the Imperial Japanese Navy.|$|E
5|$|During the 2014–15 season, {{a dismal}} run of form saw the team slip {{to the bottom}} of the league table with only 19 points from 29 matches. By 3 April 2015, they were seven points <b>adrift</b> from safety. This could have brought a sudden end to Leicester's seven-year rise, but seven wins from their final nine league matches meant the Foxes {{finished}} the season in 14th place with 41 points. They finished the season with a 5–1 thrashing of relegated Queens Park Rangers. Their upturn in results was described as one of the Premier League's greatest ever escapes from relegation. They also became only the third team in Premier League history to survive after being bottom at Christmas (the other two being West Bromwich Albion in 2005 and Sunderland in 2014), and no team with fewer than 20 points from 29 matches had previously stayed up.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{retribution}} {{for their}} actions, the mutineers decided {{to navigate the}} ship toward Spanish waters. One reason the master's life was spared was that Turner could not navigate the ship properly without his help. The Hermione sailed to La Guaira, where they handed the ship over to the Spanish authorities. The mutineers claimed they had set the officers <b>adrift</b> in a small boat, as {{had happened in the}} mutiny on the Bounty some eight years earlier. The Spanish gave the mutineers just 25 dollars each in return, and presented them with the options of joining the Spanish army, heavy labour, or refitting their ship. The Spaniards took Hermione into service under the name Santa Cecilia; her crew included 25 of her former crew, who remained under Spanish guard.|$|E
5|$|In Southeast Asia, the {{importance}} of the sea gave rise to many myths of epic ocean voyages, princesses on distant islands, monsters and magical fish lurking in the deep. In Northern Europe, kings were sometimes given ship burials when the body was laid in a vessel surrounded by treasure and costly cargo and set <b>adrift</b> on the sea. In North America, various creation stories have a duck or other creature dive {{to the bottom of the}} sea and bring up some mud out of which the dry land was formed. Atargatis was a Syrian deity known as the mermaid-goddess and Sedna was the goddess of the sea and marine animals in Inuit mythology.|$|E
5|$|It was Hamilton's {{teammate}} {{and defending}} race winner Rosberg who topped the time sheets {{at the second}} session on Friday afternoon, setting a 1:12.385 lap time. He led Hamilton by almost half a second, with the two Ferrari cars of Vettel and Räikkönen about a second <b>adrift.</b> Slight rain saw most drivers head out early, but the conditions never became wet enough to require intermediate tyres. After starting on the medium compound tyres, many drivers switched to the softer compound for race simulations, only for the session to be red flagged shortly after when Fernando Alonso spun at turn four, only to pull over {{at the side of}} the road with smoke coming from his car some corners later. Valtteri Bottas was sixth fastest, behind Daniel Ricciardo, suffering a spin at turn nine.|$|E
5|$|Low, still captaining the Fancy, sailed north. He {{captured}} a whaling vessel 80miles (130km) out at sea, {{and in a}} foul mood following the encounter with the Greyhound {{and the loss of}} Harris, tortured the captain before shooting him through the head. He set the whaler's crew <b>adrift</b> with no provisions, intending them to starve to death. They were lucky, and reached Nantucket, Massachusetts, after a difficult journey. Remaining off the coast of North America, Low's crew took a fishing boat near Block Island. Low decapitated the ship's master, and sent the crew ashore. When he captured two more fishing boats near Rhode Island, his actions became so savage his crew refused to carry out his orders to torture the fishermen.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the islands}} {{were said to have}} Culdee {{connections}}, and had chapels on them. Various saints also have connections with the islands. St Thaney or Thenaw was reputedly the mother of St Kentigern and {{is said to have been}} cast <b>adrift</b> in an oarless coracle in deep waters beyond the Isle of May by her father King Leudonus, which resulted in an abundance of fish in the seas nearby. St Adrian of May was murdered there by invading Danes in 870 (who killed St Monance in the same raid). He was buried in a stone coffin on the island but is said to have floated across the Firth before coming to rest in a churchyard at Anstruther. The Isle of May has a long history of ecclesiastical activity and there are various remains including that of a 13th-century Benedictine church.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the shark}} attacks the other kids, hitting {{one of their}} boats, and causing most of them to capsize and crash into {{each other in the}} ensuing panic, {{throwing}} several of them, including Mike and Sean, into the water. The other teens help them out of the water while two of them pull Mike out as the shark goes for him and head back to get help. Sean and the others remain <b>adrift</b> on the wreckage of tangled boats. A Coast Guard marine helicopter that Brody contacted arrives to tow them to shore. Before the pilot can tow them, the shark attacks and sinks the chopper with the pilot at the controls. It then knocks Sean into the water, but Marge sacrifices herself to save him.|$|E
