5|$|Météo-France's {{meteorological}} office at Réunion (MFR) issued advisories for storms {{in the basin}} during the year. At the time, the MFR area of warning responsibility was from the coast of Africa to 80°E, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> primarily used the Dvorak technique to estimate the intensities of tropical cyclones. The nine tropical storms and five tropical cyclones was identical to the long-term average from 1981 to 2011.|$|E
5|$|After the Third Partition of Poland (1795), many Poles {{believed}} that revolutionary France, whose public opinion was very {{sympathetic to the}} ideals of the Polish Constitution of 3 May 1791, would come to Poland's aid. France's enemies included Poland's partitioners, Prussia, Austria and Imperial Russia. Paris was the seat of two Polish organizations laying the claim to be the Polish government-in-exile, the Deputation (Deputacja) of Franciszek Ksawery Dmochowski <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Agency</b> (Agencja) of Józef Wybicki. Many Polish soldiers, officers and volunteers therefore emigrated, especially to Italy and to France. Eventually, the Agency was successful in convincing the French government (the Directory) to organize a Polish military unit. As the French Constitution did not allow for the employment of foreign troops on French soil, the French decided to use the Poles to bolster their allies in Italy, the Cisalpine Republic.|$|E

5|$|On 26 December 2013, {{a team of}} Russian {{scientists}} {{released a}} report saying they had found no trace of radioactive poisoning—a finding that comes after the French report found traces of the radioactive isotope polonium. Vladimir Uiba, {{the head of the}} Federal Medical and Biological Agency, said that Arafat died of natural causes (without explaining which) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> had no plans to conduct further tests. Unlike the Swiss report, the French and Russian reports were not made public, at the time. The Swiss experts read the French and Russian reports and explained that the radiologic data measured by the other teams support their conclusions of a probable death by polonium poisoning. In March 2015 a French prosecutor announced that his death was of natural causes, and the polonium and lead traces found were environmental.|$|E
5|$|Tai Loong {{believed}} {{that the government had}} exceeded its statutory authority by confiscating the fins. It argued that before Judge Barry Ted Moskowitz, a federal district judge for the Southern District of California, who granted an injunction against NOAA prohibiting it from selling the fins itself. The company <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> then agreed that, in return for the former putting up a $775,000 bond, that it would take possession of the shark fins, although they remained in cold storage pending the outcome of the case. Tai Loong presold the fins for an amount almost equal to the fine against it. NOAA then initiated a civil forfeiture action with the bond substituting for the fins.|$|E
5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{initially}} {{thought the}} center {{might not have}} been at the surface, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> indicated low forecasting confidence, as they could not determine a circulation center. The difficulty arose from the large, sprawling nature of the storm, and by later on May 27 a new center formed, as confirmed by radar imagery and the Hurricane Hunters. That night, the extremely small center made landfall just south of Savannah, Georgia, affecting a very small area with winds of 65mph (100km/h) and a minimum pressure of 991 mbar (hPa; 29.26 inHg). Around the time of landfall, Alpha developed a warm core, indicating some tropical characteristics. The storm weakened quickly over land, although it did not dissipate until two days later over the northeast Gulf of Mexico.|$|E

5|$|There {{were six}} storms {{named by the}} weather service in Madagascar or Mauritius, with {{advisories}} issued by Météo-France's meteorological office at Réunion (MFR). At the time, the MFR area of warning responsibility was from the coast of Africa to 80°E, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> primarily used the Dvorak technique to estimate the intensities of tropical cyclones. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), which is a joint United States Navy– United States Air Force task force that issues tropical cyclone warnings for the region, also tracked a short-lived tropical storm in February, which formed on February5 northeast of Mauritius. The system tracked to the southeast, reaching peak winds of 65km/h (40mph) before dissipating on February8 northwest of Rodrigues.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Fengshen was {{the strongest}} storm of the 2002 Pacific typhoon season. It {{developed}} on July13 from the monsoon trough near the Marshall Islands, and quickly intensified due to its small size. By July15, Fengshen attained typhoon status, and after initially moving to the north, it turned toward the northwest. On July18, the typhoon reached its peak intensity of 185km/h (115mph 10‑minute winds), according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated peak winds of 270km/h (165mph 1‑minute winds), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> estimated that Fengshen was a super typhoon for five days. This broke the record for longest duration at that intensity, previously set by Typhoon Joan in 1997, and which was later tied by Typhoon Ioke in 2006.|$|E
5|$|At {{its peak}} intensity, Typhoon Halong had gale-force winds that {{extended}} 415km (260mi) {{northeast of the}} center. It was continuing to the northwest toward Okinawa, and threatened to strike the island at near peak intensity. However, the typhoon began rapidly weakening due to increasing wind shear, and the eye quickly deteriorated. At around 1200UTC on July14, Halong made landfall on Okinawa with 10‑minute winds of 130km/h (80mph). Around that time, the typhoon moved through a weakness in the ridge, turning {{to the north and}} later accelerating to the northeast. The combination of cool, dry air, and the persistent wind shear removed the convection from the center by early on July15, weakening Halong to tropical storm status. Later that day, the JTWC discontinued advisories while the storm was approaching Japan, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> classified Halong as extratropical. The JMA continued tracking the storm, and Halong struck both the Izu and Bōsō peninsulas along Honshu. Late on July16, the JMA classified Halong as extratropical, and shortly thereafter the storm dissipated over the Kuril Islands. The extratropical remnants of Halong moved out of the basin late on July 19, just prior dissipating.|$|E

5|$|Similar to {{previous}} storms Antoinette and Bellamine, Tropical Storm Chantelle originated from the ITCZ in the Australian region. On November23, the MFR began tracking {{the system as}} a tropical disturbance off the west coast of Sumatra. The system fluctuated in intensity while moving westward, entering the south-west Indian as a tropical depression on November24. Around that time, the JTWC had begun classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 7S. On November26, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Chantelle, and the convection continued to organize despite the presence of wind shear. That day, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute winds of 120km/h (75mph). On November27, the MFR estimated peak 10minute winds of 95km/h (60mph). An approaching trough imparted significant weakening, and Chantelle weakened to tropical depression status 18hours after it was at peak intensity. A ridge behind the trough steered the weakening system to the northwest, causing Chantelle to reach the low latitude of 5°S. Widespread cloudiness made it difficult for MFR to continue tracking the circulation, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> issued the final advisory on November30 northwest of Diego Garcia. The JTWC continued tracking the storm for several more days, and the remnants of Chantelle likely contributed to the formation of the subsequent Tropical Cyclone Daniella.|$|E
5|$|Six {{hours after}} being {{declared}} a tropical disturbance, MFR upgraded it to tropical depression status, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> predicted {{the system would}} eventually reach peak winds of 130km/h (80mph) before moving ashore. Its track was expected to follow that of another tropical cyclone east of Madagascar, which would become Tropical Storm Eric. Late on January18, the system briefly became disorganized, only to re-organize and attain tropical storm status on January19; upon doing so, the Malagasy Weather Service named it Fanele. Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began issuing advisories on the storm. The agency noted uncertainty in the future track of the storm, due to interaction with Tropical Storm Eric east of Madagascar, and Fanele was located within an area of weak steering currents. Tropical Storm Fanele quickly strengthened, developing an eye feature, and late on January19 the JTWC estimated sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph); the agency predicted further strengthening to peak winds of 140km/h (85mph). Around that time, Fanele began rapid deepening under very favorable environmental conditions, and the MFR upgraded the storm to tropical cyclone status with winds of 150km/h (95mph). Upon attaining tropical cyclone status, the MFR forecast Fanele would intensify further to peak winds of 185km/h (115mph).|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} strengthened {{further and}} officially attained tropical storm status at 0000UTC on December 27, {{based on the}} analysis by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), though the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) unofficially classified it as a tropical storm six hours prior. Shortly thereafter, an eye with a 39km (24mi) diameter became apparent on satellite imagery, along with rainbands extending southward {{to the opposite side}} of the equator. At 0600UTC, the JMA first classified the system as Tropical Storm Vamei, about 65km (40mi) northeast of Singapore, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> estimated the storm attained peak winds of 85km/h (50mph) at the same time. However, the JTWC upgraded Vamei to typhoon status with peak winds of 140km/h (85mph), based on a United States Navy ship report from within the eye; a second ship reported wind gusts of 195km/h (120mph) in the southern portion of the eyewall. The storm was small and compact, with gales extending about 45km (30mi) from its center. At about 0830UTC on December 27, Vamei made landfall approximately 60km (35mi) northeast of Singapore, in the southeastern portion of the Malaysian state of Johor. Initially, the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MetMalaysia) classified the cyclone as a tropical storm, though it was later re-assessed as a typhoon at landfall.|$|E

5|$|With {{the help}} of an Egyptian agent, the CIA had {{obtained}} a sample of soil from the facility taken in December 1997 showing the presence of O-Ethyl methylphosphonothioic acid (EMPTA), a substance used in the production of VX nerve gas, at 2.5 times trace levels. (Reports are contradictory on whether the soil was obtained from within the compound itself, or outside.) The collected soil was split into three samples, which were then analyzed by a private laboratory. The agent's bona fides were later confirmed through polygraph testing; however, the CIA produced a report on Al-Shifa on July 24, 1998, questioning whether Al-Shifa produced chemical weapons or simply stored precursors, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> advised collecting more soil samples. Cohen and Tenet later briefed U.S. senators on intercepted telephone communications from the plant that reputedly bolstered the American case against Al-Shifa. U.S. intelligence also purportedly researched the Al-Shifa factory online and searched commercial databases, but did not find any medicines for sale.|$|E
5|$|Former President Hastings Banda {{established}} a pro-Western {{foreign policy that}} continued into early 2011. It included good diplomatic relationships with many Western countries. The transition from a one-party state to a multi-party democracy strengthened Malawian ties with the United States. Significant numbers of students from Malawi travel to the US for schooling, and the US has active branches of the Peace Corps, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Health and Human Services <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Agency</b> for International Development in Malawi. Malawi maintained close relations with South Africa throughout the Apartheid era, which strained Malawi's relationships with other African countries. Following the collapse of apartheid in 1994, diplomatic relationships were made and maintained into 2011 between Malawi and all other African countries. In 2010, however, Malawi's relationship with Mozambique became strained, partially due to disputes {{over the use of}} the Zambezi River and an inter-country electrical grid. In 2007, Malawi established diplomatic ties with China, and Chinese investment in the country has continued to increase since then, despite concerns regarding treatment of workers by Chinese companies and competition of Chinese business with local companies. In 2011, relations between Malawi and the United Kingdom were damaged when a document was released in which the British ambassador to Malawi criticised President Mutharika. Mutharika expelled the ambassador from Malawi, and in July 2011, the UK announced that it was suspending all budgetary aid because of Mutharika's lack of response to criticisms of his government and economic mismanagement. On 26 July 2011, the United States followed suit, freezing a US$350 million grant, citing concerns regarding the government's suppression and intimidation of demonstrators and civic groups, as well as restriction of the press and police violence.|$|E
5|$|Upon being classified, the {{disturbance}} had a broad circulation that {{was difficult to}} locate, with moderate convection in its eastern periphery. The thunderstorms organized further, and MFR upgraded {{the disturbance}} to a tropical depression at 0000UTC on February19. Three hours later, the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Cyclone 16S, and at 0600UTC that day, MFR upgraded the depression to a moderate tropical storm after an advanced scatterometer indicated winds of over 65km/h (40mph); as a result, the National Weather Service of Madagascar gave it the name Haruna. By that time, the circulation had become better organized with increased rainbands, and with an anticyclone aloft, the storm developed well-defined outflow. The structure of Haruna continued to become more symmetrical with a large radius of maximum winds, developing a ragged eye early on February20. Based on the improved appearance, MFR upgraded Haruna to a severe tropical storm at 0000UTC that day. About 12hours later, the agency upgraded Haruna further to tropical cyclone status, with 10minute winds of 120km/h (75mph). That day, an approaching trough weakened the ridge to the south, causing the cyclone to slow and move erratically. While Haruna was approaching the southwestern coast of Madagascar, it developed a 120km (75mi) wide eye, and the eyewall passed over Europa Island. Initially, MFR estimated that the storm would intensify to intense tropical cyclone status, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> assessed that Haruna reached 10minute winds of 150km/h (90mph) on February20. The next day, JTWC estimated peak 1minute winds of 185km/h (115mph). In contrast, MFR estimated {{at that time that}} the cyclone had peaked when the eyewall thunderstorms warmed, followed by the eye becoming less organized and the winds decreasing.|$|E
