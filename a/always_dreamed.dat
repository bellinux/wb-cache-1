Shortly after the Zauberflöte triumph, Mahler was forced to take sick leave for several weeks, during which he was nursed by his sister Justine and his long-time companion, the viola player Natalie Bauer-Lechner.

Emma suggests that instead of aiming to attend college on a football scholarship, Finn should utilize his musical talent. Believing Rachel's participation to be the glee club's only chance at success at Invitationals, Finn feigns romantic interest in Rachel and takes her on a date. Rachel, realizing she is unhappy performing in the school musical and excited over Finn's interest in her, returns to the glee club.

500|$|The {{context of}} [...] "Part of Your World" [...] {{and the fact}} that it occurs before Ariel meets and falls in love with Eric is often used to defend Ariel against critics who accuse her of sacrificing her talents for a man.

Similarly, Sophie Katz of The Odyssey Online wrote that the song proves that Ariel [...] "doesn’t give up her voice only for a guy. She already wanted to be 'part of that world.' The prince was a bonus." [...] Writing for Yahoo! Movies, Gwynne Watkins penned [...] "There’s little doubt that Ariel’s crush on Prince Eric strengthens her resolve to be part of the human world.

Ariel sings [...] "Bright young women, sick of swimmin’, ready to stand" [...] to indicate that she fantasizes about [...] "living in a feminist-friendly society where she can speak her mind freely and grow intellectually", demonstrating envy towards women who are capable of doing this on land. However, Times Laura Stampler joked that Ariel will find the human world disappointing [...] "considering my dad definitely still reprimanded me (even though I had legs)." [...] In the reprise, the lyrics [...] "Part of that world" [...] are replaced with [...] "part of your world" [...] to distinguish that the character is now referring to her feelings for Eric, whom Ariel had not yet met when she sang the original song.|$|E
