5|$|He {{made the}} Tigers team in spring {{training}} 1945 before finishing high school and without having played in the minor leagues, but {{sat on the bench}} before making his major league debut in June 1945, just a few weeks after his 18th birthday. He made three relief appearances that month and two more in September after a two-month stint with the Buffalo Bisons of the International League under manager Bucky Harris, and was on the Detroit roster for the team's victory in the 1945 World Series although he did not appear in any games. He had a remarkably unassuming presence; Paul Richards, then a catcher for the Tigers, later recalled occasionally going to his neighborhood drugstore. One day, Pierce went up to him <b>at</b> <b>practice</b> and asked why Richards never talked to him at the store, with Richards replying that he didn't know what Pierce was talking about; Pierce answered that the drugstore was his family's, and Richards slowly realized that Pierce had been the clerk behind the counter each time he went in.|$|E

5|$|To assist <b>at</b> <b>practice</b> for the 1927 season, Krichell signed Billy Werber from Duke University. He {{left the}} team after a month, but re-signed after graduating in 1930. During that time, Krichell was {{involved}} in what {{is considered one of}} the worst deals from the era. Barrow asked him to travel to Durham, North Carolina to negotiate with the Durham Bulls for an outfielder named Dusty Cooke. Neither Krichell nor Barrow had seen Cooke; he was believed to be a great hitter, even though he had hardly played for the Bulls. The Yankees signed him for $15,000 ($ in 2010), beating the Cleveland Indians' offer of $12,500 ($ in 2010) and an unnamed player in exchange. Cooke turned out to be an injury-prone backup outfielder, and the Yankees gave up on both Cooke and Werber. After the 1933 season, the two were traded to the Boston Red Sox for cash considerations.|$|E

Goonesena was a mere 'net bowler' but coach F.C.de Saram, a percipient observer of the game and its players, in an inspired move, insisted that Goonesena be picked for the 'Big' match to be played over the weekend. This was an unprecedented move for a player to make his debut in the 'Big' match. Goonesena played and captured 4/46 in the match, dismissing both Thomian openers in the crucial second innings, as Royal cruised to a comfortable 9-wicket victory. In the 1948 fixture he announced his burgeoning potential with a match analysis of 10/80.|$|E

Jay Cutler and Lance Briggs were projected to be out for four weeks, while Brandon Marshall, Alshon Jeffery, Charles Tillman, Major Wright and Blake Costanzo, the other five players hurt, used the bye to heal. Marc Trestman preferred to use the week to rest his players, stating, [...] "I think we did a good thing by letting these guys rest. They came back with a lot of energy [...] There was very little rust in terms of executing and getting through the practice." [...] During Trestman's tenure with the Montreal Alouettes, the Alouettes were 5–4 (...) in games after bye weeks, and 3–1 (...) in the postseason after byes. <b>At</b> <b>practice</b> on October 28, rookie Khaseem Greene filled in for Briggs, and was expected to start against the Packers.

500|$|Trumble's last cricketing tour of England was in 1902, with Darling {{returning}} to captain the Australian team. Early in the tour, Trumble broke his thumb <b>at</b> <b>practice,</b> {{causing him to}} miss {{the first month of}} the English season. Despite this, when he returned for the final three Tests he took 26wickets. In the [...] at Old Trafford, Trumble took 10wickets. This included 6wickets in the second innings when he combined with Jack Saunders to bowl England out for 120; securing an Australian victory by 3runs. Trumble, recalling his final over of the match, said [...] "With the ball greasy [...] and my boots unable to get a proper foothold on slippery turf, it was the most trying over I ever bowled." [...] In the [...] at The Oval, Trumble made 64runs in the first innings and followed this with 8wickets for 65runs in the English first innings. He took another 4wickets in the English second innings, but this was not sufficient to prevent an English victory by one wicket. Darling bowled Trumble unchanged from the Pavilion end throughout both innings of the match. [...] Wisden praised Trumble's bowling saying [...] "Trumble, paying us his fifth visit, bowled perhaps better than ever", but remarked that [...] "it must be said that the wet weather and soft wickets were all in his favour" ...|$|E
500|$|This {{left one}} {{position}} for the remaining batsmen in the squad. Up to this point, Brown had scored 800 runs on tour {{at an average of}} 72.72, with four centuries, and was on his third tour of England. Brown had played in the first-choice team in the matches against Worcestershire and the MCC. Harvey had accumulated 296 runs at 42.29, all rounder Loxton had 310 runs at 51.66, but was injured, while Hamence had made only 251 runs at 27.88 and {{was the only one of}} the four to not have scored a century. Hamence was overlooked while Brown gained selection in the First Test at Trent Bridge, batting out of position in the middle-order while Barnes and Morris were preferred as the first-choice opening pair, whereas Harvey was dropped despite making a century in Australia's most recent Test against India. This was the exact situation that had unfolded in the Worcestershire and MCC matches where Australia fielded their first-choice team; Brown batted in the middle order. Bradman explained the decision in his memoirs: [...] "Hamence was not in good enough form and Harvey scarcely ready". During the opening stages of the tour, Bradman spent little time talking to Hamence <b>at</b> <b>practice</b> sessions, leading analysts to conclude that the Australian skipper viewed Hamence as being highly unlikely to play in the Tests. Australia went on to defeat England by eight wickets, although Brown struggled and made only 17.|$|E

500|$|On December 27, {{after an}} injury to guard Iman Shumpert, the New York Knicks claimed Lin off of waivers to be a backup behind Toney Douglas and Mike Bibby. Recently signed guard Baron Davis had also been injured, and was weeks away {{from being able to}} play. Because of the lockout, coaches had had little {{opportunity}} to see Lin's play, and placed him fourth on the point guard depth chart. Lin stated that he was [...] "competing for a backup spot", and people saw him [...] "as the 12th to 15th guy on the roster. It's a numbers game," [...] yet he continued to arrive first <b>at</b> <b>practice,</b> and leave last, intensely studying game film, and working with coaches to improve his footwork and judgment. He made his season debut with the Knicks on the road against the Warriors, where he was warmly cheered in his return to Oracle Arena. In January, Lin was assigned to the Erie BayHawks of the D-League, and on January 20, he scored a triple-double with 28 points, 11 rebounds, and 12 assists in the BayHawks' 122–113 victory over the Maine Red Claws. Three days later, Lin was recalled by the Knicks, but was so fearful of being cut again that he asked a chaplain at a pregame prayer service to pray for him. If he were to be released again, Lin would consider playing in Europe, returning to the D-League, or taking a non-basketball job.|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} a single was soon deemed a [...] "stupid idea" [...] by Cornell and dropped {{in favor of an}} EP or album. The album was {{recorded}} in only 15 days, produced by the band themselves. Gossard described the recording process as a [...] "non-pressure-filled" [...] situation, as there were no expectations or pressure coming from the record company. Eddie Vedder, who had flown up from San Diego to Seattle to audition for Ament, Gossard, and McCready to be the singer of a band initially billing themselves as Mookie Blaylock (so named for a basketball player but eventually settling on Pearl Jam), was at one of the Temple of the Dog rehearsals and ended up providing backing vocals. [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell was still figuring out the vocals <b>at</b> <b>practice</b> when Vedder stepped in and filled in the blanks singing the low parts because he saw it was hard for Cornell, as Cornell later described it: [...] "He sang half of that song not even knowing that I'd wanted the part to be there and he sang it exactly the way I was thinking about doing it, just instinctively." [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became Temple of the Dog's breakout single; it was also Vedder's first featured vocal on a record. On the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty, Vedder stated; “That was the first time I heard myself on a real record.

Hall of Fame linebacker Harry Carson, who played during some of the team's down years in the 1970s, never became angry at Mara despite being frustrated with the team's performances. [...] "The Giants’ organization cares about its players more than most teams in the NFL. This stems from the top. The Maras are family men and Wellington, especially, has sought to cultivate a family atmosphere in the team.... If any NFL owner deserves a championship, it is Mara." [...] According to Parcells, Wellington made an effort {{to get to know each}} of his players. [...] "The Giants are Wellington Mara’s whole life, they have been his whole life. He’s at the office every day, he’s <b>at</b> <b>practice</b> very day, he loves hanging around the locker room and getting to know the players." [...] Despite his strong religious convictions, he put aside his personal beliefs, and avoided preaching to players who were having problems. [...] "Nobody did more for me than Wellington Mara." [...] Lawrence Taylor said. [...] "He didn’t have to save me, he didn’t have to keep helping me to find help.... And he never lectured me. I could tell he disapproved but he never lectured me." [...] Several players went to Mara's bedside as he was dying to say goodbye to the owner. The team dedicated their next game to Mara, and shut out the Redskins 36–0.|$|E
