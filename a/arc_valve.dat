25|$|A mercury <b>arc</b> <b>valve</b> {{is a type}} of {{electrical}} rectifier which converts alternating current into direct current. Rectifiers of this type were used in electric motor power supplies for industry, in electric railways, streetcars, and diesel-electric locomotives. They also found use in static inverter stations and as rectifiers for high-voltage direct current power transmission. Mercury arc rectifiers were invented by Peter Cooper Hewitt in 1902.|$|E

50|$|When it {{was built}} between March 1971 and October 1977, mercury-arc valves were used to rectify the {{alternating}} current. These valves, supplied by English Electric each had six anode columns in parallel and were the most powerful mercury <b>arc</b> <b>valves</b> ever built. Between 1992 and 1993 the mercury <b>arc</b> <b>valves</b> of Pole 1 were replaced with thyristor valves by GEC Alsthom, increasing the maximum power and voltage of the line to its current levels. The mercury <b>arc</b> <b>valves</b> of Pole 2 were replaced later by Siemens.

Since then, all mercury arc systems have been either shut down or converted to use solid state devices. The last HVDC system to use mercury <b>arc</b> <b>valves</b> was the Inter-Island HVDC link between the North and South Islands of New Zealand, which used them on one of its two poles. The mercury <b>arc</b> <b>valves</b> were decommissioned on 1 August 2012, ahead of commissioning of replacement thyristor converters.|$|R

50|$|Mercury <b>arc</b> <b>valves</b> {{require an}} {{external}} circuit {{to force the}} current to zero and thus turn off the valve. In HVDC applications, the AC power system itself provides the means of commutating the current to another valve in the converter. Consequently, converters built with mercury <b>arc</b> <b>valves</b> are known as line-commutated converters (LCC). LCCs require rotating synchronous machines in the AC systems {{to which they are}} connected, making power transmission into a passive load impossible.|$|R

50|$|Mercury <b>arc</b> <b>valves</b> with grading {{electrodes}} of {{this type}} were developed up to voltage ratings of 150 kV. However, the tall porcelain column required to house the grading electrodes was more difficult to cool than the steel tank at cathode potential, so the usable current rating was limited to about 200 - 300 A per anode. Mercury <b>arc</b> <b>valves</b> for HVDC were, therefore, often constructed with four or six anode columns in parallel. The anode columns were always air-cooled, with the cathode tanks either water-cooled or air-cooled.|$|R
5000|$|The {{electricity}} {{systems of}} the two islands were joined together by the HVDC Inter-Island link in 1965, connecting Benmore in the South Island with Haywards in the North Island.

40|$|High voltage direct current. (hvdc) {{transmission}} of electrical paver {{has been made}} possible with the recent advent of multi-anode mercury <b>arc</b> <b>valves</b> with grading electrodes. However, mercury are valves do suffer from random phenomena such as arcback, which requires special bracing for the converter transformer. In addition, mercury <b>arc</b> <b>valves</b> need considerable auxiliaries, including cooling and vacuum plants. Research and development directed towards the improvement in the voltage and current capabilities of thyristors are yielding encouraging results. In contrast to mercury <b>arc</b> <b>valves,</b> thyristors do not suffer from random phenomena and require minim auxiliaries. Considering these advantages, thyristors offer {{a viable alternative to}} mercury <b>arc</b> <b>valves</b> for hvdc converters. The comparatively low ratings of thyristors necessitate series and parallel connection of thyristors in order to construct a valve of sufficient rating for hvdc operation. The design of thyristor valve should ensure even distribution of voltage and current among all thyristors of the valve, during all operating conditions. To achieve this objective {{transmission of}} the firing signal to the gate of each thyristors should have good coherence. The thesis examines design aspects, and considers the different methods of firing both theoretically and practically. Finally, the design and subsequent experimental results of the prototype thyristors valve rated at 10 kv and 10 A are also included...|$|R

50|$|The mercury <b>arc</b> <b>valve</b> current-voltage {{characteristics}} are {{highly dependent on}} {{the temperature of the}} liquid mercury. The voltage drop in forward bias decreases from about 60 volts at 0 Â°C to somewhat above 10 volts at 50 Â°C and then stays constant; the reverse bias breakdown ("arc-back") voltage drops dramatically with temperature, from 36 kV at 60 Â°C to 12 kV at 80 Â°C to even less at higher temperatures. The operating range is therefore usually between 18-65 Â°C.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the last}} major uses of mercury arc valves was in HVDC power transmission, where they were used in many {{projects}} until the early 1970s, including the HVDC Inter-Island link between the North and South Islands of New Zealand and the HVDC Kingsnorth link from Kingsnorth power station to London. However, starting about 1975, silicon devices have made mercury-arc rectifiers largely obsolete, even in HVDC applications. The largest ever mercury-arc rectifiers, built by English Electric, were rated at 150-kV, 1800 A and were used until 2004 at the Nelson River DC Transmission System high-voltage DC-power-transmission project. The valves for the Inter-Island and Kingsnorth projects used four anode columns in parallel, while those of the Nelson River project used six anode columns in parallel {{in order to obtain}} the necessary current rating. [...] The Inter-Island link was the last HVDC transmission scheme in operation using mercury arc valves. It was formally decommissioned on 1 August 2012. The mercury <b>arc</b> <b>valve</b> converter stations of the New Zealand scheme were replaced by new thyristor converter stations. A similar mercury <b>arc</b> <b>valve</b> scheme, the HVDC Vancouver Island link was replaced by a three-phase AC link.|$|E
50|$|The {{capabilities}} and economy of power electronics system {{are determined by}} the active devices that are available. Their characteristics and limitations are a key element in the design of power electronics systems. Formerly, the mercury <b>arc</b> <b>valve,</b> the high-vacuum and gas-filled diode thermionic rectifiers, and triggered devices such as the thyratron and ignitron were widely used in power electronics. As the ratings of solid-state devices improved in both voltage and current-handling capacity, vacuum devices have been nearly entirely replaced by solid-state devices.|$|E
