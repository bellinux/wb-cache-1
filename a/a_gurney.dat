25|$|The Gurney flap {{was first}} {{applied to the}} Sikorsky S-76B variant, when flight testing {{revealed}} the horizontal stabilizer from the original S-76 did not provide sufficient lift. Engineers fitted <b>a</b> <b>Gurney</b> flap to the NACA 2412 inverted airfoil to resolve the problem without redesigning the stabilizer from scratch. <b>A</b> <b>Gurney</b> flap was also fitted to the Bell JetRanger to correct an angle of incidence problem in the design that was too difficult to correct directly.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, {{after winning}} the 24 Hours of Le Mans {{together}} with A. J. Foyt, he spontaneously sprayed champagne while celebrating on the podium. As owner of All American Racers, {{he was the first}} to put a simple right-angle extension on the upper trailing edge of the rear wing. This device, called <b>a</b> <b>Gurney</b> flap, increases downforce and, if well designed, imposes only a relatively small increase in aerodynamic drag. At the 1968 German Grand Prix he became the first driver ever to use a full face helmet in Grand Prix racing.|$|E
25|$|Equipment (including <b>a</b> <b>gurney)</b> {{from the}} trauma room at Parkland Memorial Hospital, where President Kennedy was {{pronounced}} dead, was purchased {{from the hospital}} {{by the federal government}} in 1973 and is now stored by the National Archives at an underground facility in Lenexa, Kansas. The First Lady's pink suit, the autopsy report, X-rays and President Kennedy's blood-stained jacket, shirt and tie worn during the assassination are stored in the National Archives facility in College Park, Maryland, with access controlled by a representative of the Kennedy family. The rifle used by Oswald, his diary, revolver, bullet fragments, and the windshield of Kennedy's limousine are also stored by the Archives. The Lincoln Catafalque, which President Kennedy's coffin rested on while he lay in state in the Capitol, is on display at the United States Capitol Visitor Center.|$|E

25|$|The 2010 Shelby GT500 was {{revealed}} by Ford through {{a press release}} on January 1, 2009, prior to a public unveiling at the 2009 North American International Auto Show. Many of the basic design characteristics of the new GT500 are shared {{with that of the}} Mustang and Mustang GT. The GT500 gains the same exterior and interior updates as the 2010 Mustang and Mustang GT. The front fascia is new with larger upper and lower grilles, a unique hood, large fog lights mounted in the lower front fascia (similar to the previous GT500), Shelby's signature cobra badges on the grille, front fenders, and trunk lid medallion (with Shelby lettering over the medallion), 19-inch wheels (18-inch on the convertible model), and <b>a</b> <b>Gurney</b> Flap rear spoiler. Inside the GT500 gains a cobra disc on the steering wheel, shift ball, and seats with embroidered cobras.|$|E
25|$|Patient {{transfer}} devices generally allow {{patients with}} impaired mobility {{to be moved}} by caregivers between beds, wheelchairs, commodes, toilets, chairs, stretchers, shower benches, automobiles, swimming pools, and other patient support systems (i.e., radiology, surgical, or examining tables). The most common devices are Patient lifts (for vertical transfer), Transfer benches, stretcher or convertible chairs (for lateral, supine transfer), sit-to-stand lifts (for moving patients from one seated position to another i.e., from wheelchairs to commodes), air bearing inflatable mattresses (for supine transfer i.e., transfer from <b>a</b> <b>gurney</b> to an operating room table), and sliding boards (usually used for transfer from a bed to a wheelchair). Highly dependent patients who cannot assist their caregiver in moving them often require a Patient lift (a floor or ceiling-suspended sling lift) which though invented in 1955 and in common use since the early 1960s is still considered the state-of-the-art transfer device by OSHA and the American Nursing Association.|$|E
25|$|Brunk {{revealed}} in a shoot promo {{and in the}} documentary film Forever Hardcore that {{in fact it was}} not Paul Heyman that brought him into Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) but that he was at {{the right place at the}} right time. He was referred by a friend to Tod Gordon. According to the storyline, Sabu, who at that time often arrived to the ring by his handler 911, was an uncontrollable madman strapped to <b>a</b> <b>gurney</b> and with a Hannibal Lecter-style face mask while trying to break free (he claimed to hate this part of his gimmick as he was normally tired before he started his match). Sabu could only be released from his bonds to wrestle his matches. Sabu also quickly became synonymous with table-breaking at this time; if a table was not broken during the match, Sabu would break a table with his own body after the bell had sounded, sometimes leading to 911 having to restrain Sabu during backstage interviews if a table was present.|$|E

25|$|Carlito buys train {{tickets to}} Miami {{for himself and}} Gail, now pregnant. When he stops by his club to get the stashed money, Carlito is met {{by a group of}} mobsters led by Vinnie. The Italians plan on killing Carlito, but he manages to slip out through a secret exit. The Italians pursue him {{throughout}} the city's subway system and into Grand Central Terminal, where they engage in a gunfight. Carlito kills all of his pursuers except Vinnie, who is shot and killed by police attracted by the gunfire. As Carlito runs to catch the train where Gail and Pachanga are waiting for him, he is ambushed by a disguised Benny, who shoots Carlito several times in the abdomen with a silenced gun. Pachanga admits to the dying Carlito that he is now working for Benny, only to be shot as well. Carlito hands a tearful Gail the money and tells her to escape with their unborn child and start a new life elsewhere. As he is wheeled away on <b>a</b> <b>gurney,</b> Carlito stares at a billboard with a Caribbean beach and a picture of a woman. The billboard then comes to life in his mind, and the woman, who is clearly Gail, starts dancing as Carlito slowly dies.|$|E

When Lennon arrived, he had no pulse and was not breathing. Dr. Lynn, two other doctors, a nurse, and two or three other medical attendants worked on Lennon for 10 to 15 minutes {{in a desperate attempt to}} resuscitate him. As a last resort, Dr. Lynn cut open Lennon's chest and attempted manual heart massage to restore circulation, but he quickly discovered that the damage to the blood vessels above and around Lennon's heart from the multiple bullet wounds was too great.|$|E
500|$|Three endings are available. In the [...] "Good" [...] ending, Alessa {{uses the}} Flauros to {{manifest}} {{a baby with}} half of her soul, stopping the ritual, and her spirit manifestation carries the baby {{to the outskirts of}} the town, seeing Travis off as he returns to his truck and cheerfully drives away from Silent Hill. Dialogue follows to reveal that the protagonist of the first game, Harry Mason, and his wife find and adopt the baby, naming her Cheryl, while Dahlia and Kaufmann plan to cast a spell to draw the other half of Alessa's soul back to the town, setting the events of the first Silent Hill game in motion. In the [...] "Bad" [...] ending, Travis awakens strapped to <b>a</b> <b>gurney</b> and is injected with an unknown substance: he starts convulsing and has a series of visions in which he kills two people and his form is briefly replaced by that of the Butcher. The joke ending sees Travis leave with a grey alien and a dog in an unidentified flying object.|$|E
500|$|When Owen Hart was to {{challenge}} The Godfather for the WWF Intercontinental Champion's title, he was performing as the Blue Blazer. The character, originally used by Hart {{in the late}} 1980s, had recently been revived as a superhero gimmick that parodied various wrestlers. At Over the Edge, Hart was to emulate World Championship Wrestling (WCW) wrestler Sting's (Steve Borden) ring entrance by descending from the arena rafters into the ring. The entrance was successfully tested on the November 15, 1998, episode of Sunday Night Heat; however, during his descent at Over the Edge, a cable disengaged from the safety vest he wore, and he fell more than [...] from the rafters into the ring. As he fell, he landed chest-first {{on one of the}} ring's padded turnbuckles. The accident was not seen by television viewers. A pre-recorded interview video was shown at the start of Hart's descent, and when the broadcast returned live, the cameras quickly turned away from the ring to the audience. Soon afterward, Jim Ross, one of the commentators of the event, informed pay-per-view viewers that Hart had fallen from the rafters, that the incident was [...] "not a part of the entertainment" [...] and that it was [...] "a real situation". EMTs came down to the ring and gave Hart CPR, but he showed no response to the treatment. Bringing Hart out on <b>a</b> <b>gurney,</b> the EMTs boarded the heavily injured wrestler into an ambulance and took him to a nearby hospital in Kansas City.|$|E

2500|$|For a {{long time}} before it was formalised, it had been known by doctors and {{midwives}} that mouth to mouth resuscitation could be useful in bringing a lifeless newborn around.

Elam described the event in his own words as [...] "I was browsing around to get acquainted with the ward when along the corridor came <b>a</b> <b>gurney</b> racing - a nurse pulling it and two orderlies pushing it, and the kid on it was blue.

2500|$|On November 22, 1963, Rose was in {{his office}} at Parkland Memorial Hospital across the {{corridor}} from Trauma Room 1 when he received word that Kennedy was pronounced dead. He walked across the corridor to the trauma room occupied by Jacqueline Kennedy and a priest who had been called in to administer last rites. There, Rose was met by Secret Service agent Roy Kellerman and Kennedy's personal physician George Burkley who told him that {{there was no time for}} an autopsy because Mrs. Kennedy would not leave Dallas without her husband's body which was to be delivered promptly to the airport. At the time of the assassination of Kennedy, the murder of a United States President was not covered by federal law. Rose objected, insisting that Texas law required him to perform a post-mortem examination prior to the removal of the body. A heated exchange ensued as he argued with Kennedy's aides. Kennedy's body was placed in a casket and, accompanied by Mrs. Kennedy, rolled down the corridor on <b>a</b> <b>gurney.</b> Rose was reported to have stood in a hospital doorway, backed by a policeman, in an attempt to prevent the removal of the coffin.
