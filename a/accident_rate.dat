5|$|In October 2007, Time Magazine ran {{an article}} condemning the V-22 as unsafe, overpriced, and {{completely}} inadequate; the Marine Corps responded {{by arguing that}} parts of the article's data were dated, obsolete, inaccurate, and reflected expectations too high for any new field of aircraft. In 2011, it was reported by the controversial defense industry supported Lexington Institute that the average V-22 mishap rate per flight hour over the past 10 years was {{approximately half of the}} average <b>accident</b> <b>rate</b> for the USMC fleet; the V-22's <b>accident</b> <b>rate</b> was the lowest of any Marine rotorcraft. In 2011 Wired Magazine reported that the safety record was achieved by excluding ground incidents; the USMC responded that MV-22 reporting was to the same standards as other aircraft in the Department of the Navy.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} three years, the route was {{improved}} west to Highway10 (Hurontario Street). This work was completed in early 1956. Service roads were installed and 13 intersections eliminated, resulting in a 50% reduction of the <b>accident</b> <b>rate</b> along that section.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a {{significant}} number of accidents involving the Sea Harrier; this <b>accident</b> <b>rate</b> has caused approximately half the fleet to be lost with only 11 fighters remaining in service.

40|$|A {{study by}} West, Elander & French (1993 a) {{examining}} {{the relationship between}} mild social deviance and <b>accident</b> <b>rates</b> on the road was extended and replicated.

The aim of the present research was to determine whether a broader measure of road traffic violations would fully mediate the relationship between mild social deviance and <b>accident</b> <b>rates.</b> Self-reports of violations (using the Driver Behaviour Questionnaire), mild social deviance and <b>accident</b> <b>rates</b> were collected for 830 drivers, together with information about age, sex and annual mileage. A series of Poisson regressions were computed to investigate the relationship between these predictor variables and <b>accident</b> <b>rates.</b> The data confirmed the relationship between mild social deviance and <b>accident</b> <b>rates.</b> However, this relationship appeared to be mediated by the propensity to commit driving violations and unspecified factors associated with age. The results of the analysis are discussed with reference to the appropriateness of various intervention strategies to promote safer driving...|$|R
5|$|During the Harrier's {{service the}} RAF {{positioned}} {{the bulk of}} the aircraft in West Germany to defend against a potential invasion of Western Europe by the Warsaw Pact forces; the unique abilities of the Harrier allowed the RAF to disperse their forces away from vulnerable airbases. The USMC used their Harriers primarily for close air support, operating from amphibious assault ships, and, if needed, forward operating bases. Harrier squadrons saw several deployments overseas. The Harrier's ability to operate with minimal ground facilities and very short runways allowed it to be used at locations unavailable to other fixed-wing aircraft. The Harrier received criticism for having a high <b>accident</b> <b>rate</b> and for a time-consuming maintenance process.|$|E
5|$|Only 4.46% of the {{recreational}} diving fatalities in a 1997 study were attributable {{to a single}} contributory cause. The remaining fatalities probably arose {{as a result of}} a progressive sequence of events involving two or more procedural errors or equipment failures, and since procedural errors are generally avoidable by a well-trained, intelligent and alert diver, working in an organised structure, and not under excessive stress, it was concluded that the low <b>accident</b> <b>rate</b> in professional scuba diving is due to this factor. The study also concluded that it would be impossible to completely eliminate all minor contraindications of scuba diving, as this would result in overwhelming bureaucracy and bring all diving to a halt.|$|E
5|$|Since MD 404 is {{the main}} route for {{travelers}} between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and the Delaware Beaches, the road has a high <b>accident</b> <b>rate.</b> To improve on this situation, the Maryland State Highway Administration is planning to widen the two-lane portions of the route into a four-lane divided highway. A portion of the road east of Tuckahoe Creek in Caroline County received $7.7 million for widening {{as a part of}} the stimulus bill signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2009; this section was widened in 2012.

40|$|This paper revisits the {{question}} of the relationship between rural road geometric characteristics, <b>accident</b> <b>rates</b> and their prediction, using a rigorous non-parametric statistical methodology known as hierarchical tree-based regression. The goal of this paper is twofold. first, it develops a methodology that quantitatively assesses the effects of various highway geometric characteristics on <b>accident</b> <b>rates</b> and, second, it provides a straightforward, yet fundamentally and mathematically sound way of predicting <b>accident</b> <b>rates</b> on rural roads. The results show that although the importance of isolated variables differs between two-lane and multilane roads, 'geometric design' variables and 'pavement condition' variables are the two most important factors affecting <b>accident</b> <b>rates.</b> Further, the methodology used in this paper allows for the explicit prediction of <b>accident</b> <b>rates</b> for given highway sections, as soon as the profile of a road section is given.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{theoretical and empirical}} analysis {{of the effects of}} no fault automobile insurance on <b>accident</b> <b>rates.</b> As a mechanism for compensating the victims of automobile accidents, no fault has several important advantages over the tort system. However, by restricting access to tort, no fault may weaken incentives for careful driving, leading to higher <b>accident</b> <b>rates.</b> We conduct an empirical analysis of automobile <b>accident</b> fatality <b>rates</b> in all U. S. states over the period 1982 - 1994, controlling for the potential endogeneity of no fault laws. The results support the hypothesis that no fault is significantly associated with higher fatal <b>accident</b> <b>rates</b> than tort. ...|$|R

5|$|A high <b>accident</b> <b>rate</b> {{may also}} occur because Thoroughbreds, {{particularly}} in the United States, are first raced as 2-year-olds, well before they are completely mature. Though they may appear full-grown and are in superb muscular condition, their bones are not fully formed. However, catastrophic injury rates are higher in 4- and 5-year-olds than in 2- and 3-year-olds. Some believe that correct, slow training of a young horse (including foals) may actually be beneficial to the overall soundness of the animal. This is because, during the training process, microfractures occur in the leg followed by bone remodeling. If the remodeling is given sufficient time to heal, the bone becomes stronger. If proper remodeling occurs before hard training and racing begins, the horse will have a stronger musculoskeletal system and will have a decreased chance of injury.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>accident</b> <b>rate</b> per 100 {{million miles}} for {{professional}} truckers is low, {{the high number}} of miles driven by a truck driver makes truck driving a risky occupation. Trucking transportation occupations accounted for one quarter of all work-related fatalities in 2015, more than any other U.S. job, according to the U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics' annual workplace fatality report. The fatal injury rate in 2015 was 14.7 per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers in transportation and material moving occupations (which includes both truckers and air transportation workers.) This was a significantly lower rate than for workers in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations, but high compared to most other occupation categories. The report did not break out the fatal injury rate per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers among aircraft pilots and flight engineers but did note that they had a high fatal injury rate compared to all workers. There were 57 fatalities among aircraft pilots and flight engineers in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Typically {{operated}} {{from small}} aircraft carriers, large amphibious assault ships and simple forward operating bases, AV-8Bs {{have participated in}} numerous military and humanitarian operations, proving themselves versatile assets. U.S. Army General Norman Schwarzkopf named the USMC Harrier II as one of several important weapons in the Gulf War. The aircraft took part in combat during the Iraq War beginning in 2003. The Harrier II has served in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan since 2001, and was used in Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya in 2011. Italian and Spanish Harrier IIs have taken part in overseas conflicts in conjunction with NATO coalitions. During its service history, the AV-8B has had a high <b>accident</b> <b>rate,</b> related to the percentage {{of time spent in}} critical take-off and landing phases. USMC and Italian Navy AV-8Bs are to be replaced by the Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II, with the former expected to operate its Harriers until 2025.|$|E

5|$|Weather {{conditions}} typically {{vary greatly}} depending on altitude; hot countries can experience heavy snowfall in mountainous regions yet receive {{very little in}} low-lying areas, increasing the <b>accident</b> <b>rate</b> among drivers inexperienced in winter driving. In addition, road surface temperatures can fall rapidly at higher altitudes, precipitating rapid frost formation. As a result, gritting and plowing runs are often prioritised in favour of clearing these mountain roads, especially at the start {{and end of the}} snow season. The hazardous roads through mountain passes pose additional problems for the large winter service vehicles. The heavy metal frame and bulky grit makes hill climbing demanding for the vehicle, so vehicles have extremely high torque transmission systems to provide enough power to make the climb. Furthermore, because the tight hairpin turns found on mountain slopes are difficult for long vehicles to navigate, winter service vehicles for use in mountainous areas are shortened, usually from six wheels to four.|$|E
5|$|Route 21 heads {{north from}} the Newark Airport Interchange with U.S. Route 1/9 and U.S. Route 22 in Newark near the Newark Liberty International Airport on the six-lane, divided McCarter Highway. This portion of Route 21 serves to connect Newark Liberty with {{downtown}} Newark. The route interchanges with Interstate 78 and then crosses over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor rail line on a viaduct, {{coming to an}} interchange with Broad Street that provides access to Route 27. The route continues north, paralleling the elevated Northeast Corridor tracks that lead up to Newark Penn Station, which serves Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains. At the Emmet Street intersection, Route 21 becomes a four-lane, undivided road and intersects Murray Street, which provides access to the Ironbound neighborhood of Newark. This section of Route 21 through {{the southern part of}} Newark has a high <b>accident</b> <b>rate</b> due to the heavy concentration of businesses and traffic lights along this portion of road. The road widens to six lanes and the route intersects County Route 510 (Market Street) near Newark Penn Station and continues north into downtown Newark, splitting from the Northeast Corridor rail line. It crosses Raymond Boulevard and the route meets County Route 508 (Center Street), with which it forms a concurrency.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland State Highway Administration {{is working}} on {{improvements}} to MD 404 {{in order to provide}} relief to travelers driving to the ocean resorts, notably by widening the remainder of the route into a four-lane divided highway. The primary motive behind the widening is the high <b>accident</b> <b>rate</b> that plagues the two-lane road, brought on by beach traffic. The divided highway portion of MD 404 in the Denton area was extended further in the 2000s from the south end of Denton to the Sennett Road intersection east of where MD 16 joins the route. The section between south of Legion Road and Double Hills Road was widened in 2005 while the section between Double Hills Road and Sennett Road was widened in 2007. This project received $3 million from the federal government in 2001. As part of the stimulus bill signed into law by President Barack Obama on February 17, 2009, $7.7 million went to widening a portion of MD 404 east of Tuckahoe Creek in Caroline County, creating 221 jobs. The widening of this section was completed in 2012. On May 21, 2014, groundbreaking took place to widen MD 404 between west of MD 309 and Cemetery Road. The project to widen this section of will cost a total of $39 million. On June 25, 2015, Governor Larry Hogan announced that state funding would be allocated to finish widening MD 404 between US 50 and Denton, among other projects across the state. A total of $160 million in funds would go to widening MD 404. The work on this is nearing completion in early 2017. Widening of the section between west of MD 309 and Cemetery Road is expected to be completed by summer 2017 while widening of the remaining sections of MD 404 between US 50 and Denton is planned to be completed by late 2017.|$|E

The result holds, even if we take the heterogeneity across drivers into account, and is robust to various parametric and nonparametric procedures.
