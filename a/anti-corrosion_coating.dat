By virtue of scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, {{the influence of}} intermediate argon plasma treatments on the coating microstructures, mechanical properties and corrosion properties as well as tribological behaviors in artificial seawater solutions were systematically investigated. It was assumed that the mechanical properties, adhesion strength, corrosion and tribological performances of coatings depended on argon plasma treatment steps. High-performance coatings could be obtained by proper plasma treatment steps. The superior <b>anti-corrosion</b> ability of <b>coating</b> with appropriate treatment steps may be ascribed to the increased charge transfer resistance due to alternative interface and CrN layer and the compact microstructure.

A {approx} 75 {micro}m thick PES coating performed well in protecting the steel against corrosion in brine at 200 C.

30|$|This {{investigation}} provided {{useful information}} {{for improving the}} production of DHA {{and the quality of}} oil from BL 10 through the optimization of culture conditions. The first method is the adoption of 0.5 % diluted seawater for the cultivation of BL 10. In our study, cultures cultivated by 0.5 % diluted seawater yielded the greatest production of high-quality oil in BL 10 cells. This approach would require fermenters with <b>anti-corrosion</b> <b>coating,</b> because chloride levels in 0.5 % diluted seawater are highly corrosive to stainless steel. In addition, the decrease in dry biomass and increase in cellular debris we observed with this treatment (compared with BL 10 cultivated in 1.0 % and 0.2 %) suggests that the extremely high quantities of oil accumulating in cells could result in cell disruption. As a result, strong agitation that could shear cells must be avoided when lipid content is high. For cases in which anti-corrosion fermenters are unavailable, sodium sulfate could be used as an alternative to sea salts in order to reduce chloride ions in the medium. Unfortunately, the addition of sodium sulfate reduces the quality of the oil produced as well. To salvage the quality of oil, the fed-batch method (instead of the batch cultivation method) could be employed.|$|E

The model system, GO stabilized styrene in water, was used to explore the mechanistic details of the stable emulsion formation and subsequent formation of polystyrene/graphene oxide (PS/GO) containers after emulsion polymerization. The results indicate a clear size effect during packing of GO at oil-water interface and smaller GO sheets produced homogenous emulsion without any residual water volume. The emulsion droplet size distribution changes from bimodal to monomodal with the increase in GO concentration and it reverses with oil water phase ratio. For the first time, a correlation was developed between these variables and the size, polydispersity index (PDI), morphology, conversion, and yield of the containers produced by emulsion polymerization. The parametric controls required for preparing PS/GO containers with narrow size distribution (PDI = 0. 23), smaller size and various morphologies are discussed, with a probable mechanism.

40|$|The {{non-destructive}} testing of pipeline systems under maintenance {{is an important}} task. Improving the testing system sensitivity will improve the accuracy of residual lifetime predictions. This leads {{to the development of}} new inspection technique. Typically inspection of welding joints comes under purview of many standards and has become a common practice. When it comes to pipe body, non-availability of standards limits the usage of commonly used testing techniques. Testing of large areas require large amount of time using conventional bulk wave testing. The presence of the <b>anti-corrosion</b> <b>coating</b> makes the testing more complex. The solution for the above problem is to use guided waves, which improves the speed of testing. The ultrasonic long-range inspection using guided waves made significant progress in the last 10 - 15 years. Generating guided waves at one location can cover very long range. Using this technique, corrosion damage as well as cracks in the pipe section can be detected. In order to obtain a larger range capability low-frequency ultrasonic waves (20 - 250 kHz) are used. The ultrasonic testing over distances up to 100 meters and more is possible. The testing systems more commonly available in the market for the long-range inspection use piezoelectric probes. Low-frequency electromagnetic US-transducers were developed in Fraunhofer-IZFP, which allow transmitting and receiving of the ultrasonic mode SS 0 in thin-walled inspection objects like pipes, plates, tanks and containers.

40|$|Surface {{preparation}} methods {{play a major}} role in many technical applications such as paint and <b>anti-corrosion</b> <b>coating</b> or adhesive joining. They are crucial for producing reliable surfaces that allow the formation of adhesive bonds with high initial strengths and high long-term stability in degrading environments. The surface {{preparation methods}} depend strongly on the material combination and the operating conditions that the joint will be exposed to. Bonding metals to thermoplastic polymers (e. g. PEEK) is a particular challenge that poses high requirements towards the chemical and structural surface properties. Contrary to chemically consolidating adhesives, thermoplastic polymers are commonly assumed to bond only via mechanical interlocking and weaker physical interactions. Previous studies showed that Nd:YAG-laser-treatments allow the formation of strong Titanium-PEEK-interfaces with high degradation resistance against humidity. The goal of our present research aims at transferring the methodology to steel-PEEK interfaces and developing a fundamental understanding of the underlying processes and problems. The knowledge of the interface’s and the laser-generated oxide film’s properties, the nature of mechanical, physical and chemical bonds formed, and the degradation processes is a prerequisite for systematic furthering of adhesive technologies for new materials and applications. In this study we report the first results obtained on laser-treated surfaces of highly ductile high-strength TWIP-steel and the adhesion properties to PEEK. Fracture-mechanical studies by means of single-lap-shear (SLS) and degradation experiments were performed with regard to the laser process parameters. Electron-microscopy showed the formation of oxide films upon laser irradiation in ambient atmosphere. Further investigation of the SLS fracture surfaces implied the occurrence of different failure mechanisms. Chemically-sensitive scanning electron microscopy allowed the differentiation between “apparent” adhesive failure as detected with a light-microscope and pseudo-adhesive failure in the PEEK-interface region by means of residual PEEK.

Within the framework of this study, three main tests were conducted: compressive tests and tensile test on specimens of cement paste and mortar containing graphene, and half-cell potential test on corrosion initiation of steel bars coated with graphene and embbeded in cement mortar. From the literature, several research studies indicate the significance to investigate the graphene and its derivatives with cement composites within a multi-scale approach. According to one of the studies addition of graphene oxides (GO) with 1. 5 % by weight of cement revealed an increase in tensile strength by 48 % compared with the cement mixture without graphene oxides. The Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) images showed good bonding between GO and the cement particles. The results obtained from the experimental study of this master thesis work did not, however, reflect graphene’s potential {{due to the fact that}} the functionalized graphene used in this study contained functional groups with silicon oxides, which were polymerized and inactive for chemical interaction with the cement hydrates. The study results from the literature also proved that single but also multi-layer graphene can work as <b>anti-corrosion</b> <b>coating.</b> The corrosion test from this master thesis work indicated that the specimens with graphene coating revealed a delayed corrosion initiation and some repassivation-depassivation cycles, as a result of the higher amount of chlorides needed for the depassivation of the passive film...|$|E
40|$|In {{material}} systems {{consisting of}} hard second phase particles in a ductile matrix, failure initiating from cracking {{of the second}} phase particles is an important failure mechanism. This dissertation applies the principles of fracture mechanics to consider this problem, first {{from the standpoint of}} fracture of the particles, and then the onset of crack propagation from fractured particles. This research was inspired by the observation of the failure mechanism of a commercial zinc-based <b>anti-corrosion</b> <b>coating</b> and the analysis was initially approached as coatings problem. As the work progressed it became evident that failure mechanism was relevant to a broad range of composite material systems and research approach was generalized to consider failure of a system consisting of ellipsoidal second phase particles in a ductile matrix. The starting point for the analysis is the classical Eshelby Problem, which considered stress transfer from the matrix to an ellipsoidal inclusion. The particle fracture problem is approached by considering cracks within particles and how they are affected by the particle/matrix interface, the difference in properties between the particle and matrix, and by particle shape. These effects are mapped out {{for a wide range of}} material combinations. The trends developed show that, although the particle fracture problem is very complex, the potential for fracture among a range of particle shapes can, for certain ranges in particle shape, be considered easily on the basis of the Eshelby Stress alone. Additionally, the evaluation of cracks near the curved particle/matrix interface adds to the existing body of work of cracks approaching bi-material interfaces in layered material systems. The onset of crack propagation from fractured particles is then considered as a function of particle shape and mismatch in material properties between the particle and matrix. This behavior is mapped out for a wide range of material combinations. The final section of this dissertation qualitatively considers an approach to determine critical particle sizes, below which crack propagation will not occur for a coating system that exhibited stable cracks in an interfacial layer between the coating and substrate...|$|E
