Our goal {{is to improve the}} performance of the network, in terms of channel utilization and network throughput, using two scheduling techniques: <b>the</b> prediction <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sorting</b> technique. <b>The</b> new proposed algorithm adopts <b>the</b> prediction <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sorting</b> feature, in a different way. Our work includes the presentation of the novel algorithm, the comparison of two ancestors scheduling algorithms with <b>the</b> new one, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> simulation results of each of the three scheduling algorithms...|$|R

500|$|Most of Ravel's piano {{music is}} {{extremely}} difficult to play, and presents pianists with a balance of technical and artistic challenges. Writing of the piano music the critic Andrew Clark commented in 2013, [...] "A successful Ravel interpretation is a finely balanced thing. It involves subtle musicianship, a feeling for pianistic colour <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> of lightly worn virtuosity that masks the advanced technical challenges he makes in Alborada del gracioso... and the two outer movements of Gaspard de la nuit. Too much temperament, and the music loses its classical shape; too little, and it sounds pale." [...] This balance caused a breach between the composer and Viñes, who said that if he observed the nuances and speeds Ravel stipulated in Gaspard de la nuit [...] "Le gibet" [...] would [...] "bore the audience to death". Some pianists continue to attract criticism for over-interpreting Ravel's piano writing.|$|E

[...] Bono shared this opinion, stating, [...] "We went so far out on the Sufi singing <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> of ecstatic-music front, that we had to ground it and find a counterpoint." [...] Eno commented that many of [...] "the more contemplative and sonically adventurous songs" [...] had been dropped, attributing the lack of African-inspired music to its sounding [...] "synthetic" [...] and unconvincing when paired with other songs.|$|E

One of the characters, Tiro, an officer in the republican guard, discusses his life in conversation with Savrola, mirroring the life of a subaltern officer in the Indian Army which Churchill had experienced.

[...] "It's a very dramatic song, very moving. Arabic strings. It's imagining Earth losing its gravitational pull and starting to fall". As it turned out, Humperdinck's manager had listened to the proposed selection and declined the offer for him without his knowing. Humperdinck later stated in an interview that his manager declining the collaboration offer was [...] "the most grievous sin ever committed", and that he would have gladly collaborated with the Gorillaz if he had known they asked. With or without Humperdinck, Albarn insists the tune will eventually be released. [...] "I'm going to finish that off", he said. [...] "It just needs the vocal. We've made contact with Indian singer Asha Bhosle and I think it's definitely going to happen. I'll maybe duet with her; the song has these answering phrases".

Hitler wanted to bring German Catholics into the volksgemeinschaft, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> of terrorist methods used against the Marxist parties, namely the SPD and the KPD-both of which were banned- were not used against the Zentrum and the Bavarian People's Party. Realizing belatedly that being a non-party politician had left him in a weak position regarding the NSDAP, Papen founded a new political party on 5 April 1933 called the League of German Catholics Cross and Eagle, which was intended as a conservative Catholic party that would hold the NSDAP in check while at the same time working with the NSDAP. In a letter to Hitler, Papen argued that his party was no threat to the regime as it intended to enlist Catholic support for the [...] "national revolution" [...] (the NSDAP had trouble winning votes in Catholic areas), to create a [...] "common front" [...] between all the factions of the right, and to end the [...] "misunderstandings" [...] between Roman Catholicism and National Socialism. Both the Zentrum and the Bavarian People's Party declined to merge into Papen's new party while the rival Coalition of Catholic Germans which was sponsored by the NSDAP proved more effective at recruiting German Catholics.|$|E
