5|$|Horses have a {{great sense}} of balance, due partly to their ability to feel their footing and partly to highly {{developed}} proprioception—the unconscious sense of where the body and limbs are at all times.

Horses are able to sense contact as subtle as an insect landing <b>anywhere</b> <b>on</b> the body.|$|E
5|$|It is {{acceptable}} to defend from a violent attack <b>anywhere</b> <b>on</b> the street especially {{when a person is}} attacked with a knife or another deadly weapon. Shooting an unarmed attacker also occurs and becomes sometimes a subject of controversy. In general, each case is investigated in great detail before being eventually dismissed as a legitimate self-defense. The defense is judged according to the subjective and objective perception of the defender {{during the time of the}} imminent or ongoing attack, and not according to the view of persons who are judging it ex post.|$|E
5|$|Squall lines, or solid {{bands of}} strong thunderstorms, can form ahead of cold fronts and lee troughs {{due to the}} {{presence}} of significant atmospheric moisture and strong upper level divergence, leading to hail and high winds. When significant directional wind shear exists in the atmosphere ahead of a cold front {{in the presence of a}} strong upper level jet stream, tornado formation is possible. Although tornadoes can form <b>anywhere</b> <b>on</b> Earth, the greatest number occur in the Great Plains in the United States, because downsloped winds off the north-south oriented Rocky Mountains, which can form a dryline, aid their development at any strength.|$|E

5|$|Although the Greeks and Romans {{did much}} to advance water clock technology, they still {{continued}} to use shadow clocks. The mathematician and astronomer Theodosius of Bithynia, for example, {{is said to have}} invented a universal sundial that was accurate <b>anywhere</b> <b>on</b> Earth, though little is known about it. Others wrote of the sundial in the mathematics and literature of the period. Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, the Roman author of De Architectura, wrote on the mathematics of gnomons, or sundial blades. During the reign of Emperor Augustus, the Romans constructed the largest sundial ever built, the Solarium Augusti. Its gnomon was an obelisk from Heliopolis. Similarly, the obelisk from Campus Martius was used as the gnomon for Augustus's zodiacal sundial. Pliny the Elder records that the first sundial in Rome arrived in 264, looted from Catania, Sicily; according to him, it gave the incorrect time until the markings and angle appropriate for Rome's latitude were used—a century later.|$|E
5|$|Another {{point of}} {{contention}} came from the navy's heavy use of corporal punishment for even minor offenses. While such measures had been banned {{in the general population}} since the Imperial Constitution of 1824 and in the army since 1874, the navy was only affected in November 1889, when the new republic's legislature forbade such discipline. They rescinded the law {{less than a year later}} amid widespread noncompliance. Instead, corporal punishment would only be allowed in a Companhia Correcional (Correctional Company). The legislature envisioned this as a curb on the practice, as only sailors with violent or subversive histories would face the lash. The reality was very different: because the companies existed <b>anywhere</b> <b>on</b> the ships, any sailor could be theoretically transferred to the Companhia Correcional but not have any change in their daily routines.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, Riesling was {{sometimes}} {{claimed to have}} originated from wild vines of the Rhine region, without much support to back up that claim. More recently, DNA fingerprinting by Ferdinand Regner indicated that one parent of Riesling is Gouais blanc, known to the Germans as Weißer Heunisch, a variety that, while rare today, was widely grown by the French and German peasantry of the Middle Ages. The other parent is {{a cross between a}} wild vine and Traminer. It is presumed that the Riesling was born somewhere in the valley of the Rhine, since both Heunisch and Traminer have a long documented history in Germany, but with parents from either side of the Adriatic the cross could have happened <b>anywhere</b> <b>on</b> the way.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Ioke {{became one}} of five hurricanes to reach Category 5 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale in the Central North Pacific Ocean, {{and the only one}} {{originating}} in the basin. With an estimated minimum central pressure of 915mbar (27.019inHg), the cyclone attained the lowest estimated surface pressure for any hurricane within the basin, surpassing the previous minimum set by Hurricane Gilma in 1994. Ioke maintained at least Category4 status for 198consecutive hours, which was the longest continuous time period at that intensity ever observed for any tropical cyclone <b>anywhere</b> <b>on</b> Earth. Additionally, the cyclone remained at the equivalence of a super typhoon for 174consecutive hours, which was also a record. As a result of its extended duration and intensity, Hurricane/Typhoon Ioke accrued an Accumulated cyclone energy index of 82, which set a new worldwide record.|$|E
5|$|Most park {{visitors}} sightsee {{using the}} scenic drive, which {{provides access to}} 13 viewpoints over the amphitheaters. Bryce Canyon has eight marked and maintained hiking trails that can be hiked {{in less than a}} day (round trip time, trailhead): Mossy Cave (one hour, State Route 12 northwest of Tropic), Rim Trail (5–6 hours, <b>anywhere</b> <b>on</b> rim), Bristlecone Loop (one hour, Rainbow Point), and Queens Garden (1–2 hours, Sunrise Point) are easy to moderate hikes. Navajo Loop (1–2 hours, Sunset Point) and Tower Bridge (2–3 hours, north of Sunrise Point) are moderate hikes. Fairyland Loop (4–5 hours, Fairyland Point) and Peekaboo Loop (3–4 hours, Bryce Point) are strenuous hikes. Several of these trails intersect, allowing hikers to combine routes for more challenging hikes.|$|E
5|$|The Battle for Middle-earth II is a {{real-time}} strategy game. Similar to , {{the game}} {{requires that the}} player build a base with structures to produce units, gather resources, research upgrades, and provide defenses. Units are used to attack the enemy and defend the player's base. Players win matches by eliminating all enemy unit producing structures. Unlike the first game, the player can build an unlimited number of structures <b>anywhere</b> <b>on</b> the map, allowing for more freedom in base building and unit production. Players can build walls to defend their base; however, the walls can only be constructed within a certain proximity to the players fortress. They can also construct arrow and catapult towers on building plots around a fortress to provide defensive support and basic protection. Along with this, each factions' fortress is uniquely equipped with a special power reached only by purchasing necessary upgrades. The game's HUD, called the Palantír, shows the player's hero units and their abilities, a mini-map, and objectives.|$|E
