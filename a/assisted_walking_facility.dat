40|$|AbstractThis {{paper has}} focused on the {{analysis}} of pedestrian flow characteristics for 3 different groups of <b>walking</b> <b>facilities</b> including two-way escalator, ascending escalator combined with descending stairway, and descending escalator combined with ascending stairway between platform and concourse layer in an L-shaped interchange metro station. Data were collected by field observations to develop flow-density-speed relationship for each group of <b>walking</b> <b>facility</b> and analysis has been done to compare pedestrian flow characteristics and walking behavior on various groups of facilities. It has shown that <b>walking</b> <b>facilities</b> in the station discussed are not properly used for the pedestrian flow in rush hours and not safe, and an optimized usage of those facilities has been proposed according to the station structure and the analysis above.

40|$|Walking is an {{environmentally}} friendly mode of transportation. A {{better understanding of}} pedestrian activities and effective planning of <b>walking</b> <b>facilities</b> are particularly important for densely populated Asian cities like Hong Kong. Empirical studies on pedestrian flows can be classified as controlled experiments and observational surveys. Controlled experiments are flexible and can be designed {{to fulfill the requirements}} of specific studies and eliminate influence from unrelated factors. Observational surveys provide data for pedestrian movements in different types of <b>walking</b> <b>facilities.</b> This thesis aims to develop a mathematical model for multidirectional pedestrian flows based on knowledge obtained from both a controlled experiment and observational surveys on three different <b>walking</b> <b>facilities.</b> Bayesian inference is adopted for model calibration, as it can combine the prior information from the controlled experiment and the observed data from the observational surveys. The proposed model is based on Drake’s (1967) model of traffic flow. However, multidirectional pedestrian flows are much more complicated than the unidirectional and bidirectional flows. Therefore, instead of relating the speed of a pedestrian stream solely to pedestrian density, the flow ratio and intersecting angles between streams are introduced as factors that may influence stream speed. The proposed model {{takes the form of a}} set of structural equations rather than a single deterministic function. By applying Bayesian inference, the proposed model is calibrated with the three sets of observed data respectively, based on the prior distribution specified by the controlled experiment results. Finally, pedestrian movements in three different <b>walking</b> <b>facilities</b> are analyzed based on the properties of the calibrated model. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} ecological {{model predictions}} of cross-level interactions among psychosocial and environmental correlates {{of physical activity}} in 719 community-dwelling older adults in the Baltimore, Maryland and Seattle, Washington areas during 2005 – 2008. Method: Walkability, access to parks and recreation facilities and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) minutes per week (min/week) were measured objectively. Neighborhood aesthetics, <b>walking</b> <b>facilities,</b> social support, self-efficacy, barriers and transportation and leisure walking min/week were self-reported. Results: Walkability interacted with social support in explaining total MVPA (B = 13. 71) and with social support (B = 7. 90), self-efficacy (B = 7. 66) and barriers (B = − 8. 26) in explaining walking for transportation.

40|$|Abstract The {{availability}} of efficient transportation facilities {{is vital to}} the function and development of modern cities. Promoting walking is crucial for supporting livable communities and cities. Assessing the quality of pedestrian facilities and constructing appropriate pedestrian <b>walking</b> <b>facilities</b> are important tasks in public city planning. Additionally, <b>walking</b> <b>facilities</b> in a community affect commercial activities including private investment decisions such as those of retailers. However, analyzing what we call pedestrian friendliness in an urban environment involves multiple data perspectives, such as street networks, land use, and other multivariate observation measurements, and consequently poses sig-nificant challenges. In this study, we investigate the effect of urban environment properties on pedestrian movement in different locations in the metropolitan region of Tel Aviv. The first urban area we investigated was the inner city of the Tel Aviv metropolitan region, one of the central regions in Tel Aviv, a city that serves many non-local residents. For simplicity, we refer to this area as Tel Aviv. We also investigated Bat Yam, a small city, whose residents use many of the services of Tel Aviv. We apply an improved tool for visual analysis of the correlation between multiple independent and one dependent variable in geographical context. We use the tool to investigate the effect of functional and topological properties on the volume of pedestrian movement. The results of our study indicate that these tw...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation was to study walking behaviors of pedestrian groups involving individuals with disabilities. To this end, large scale controlled walking experiments were conducted at Utah State University (USU) to examine walking behaviors in various <b>walking</b> <b>facility</b> types, such as passageway, right angle, oblique angle, queuing area, bottleneck, and stairs. Walking experiments were conducted over four days involving participants with and without disabilities. Automated video identification and semi-structured questionnaires were used to collect revealed and stated walking data. This study provided statistical analysis and models to study three different aspects of operational walking behaviors. Firstly, walking speed was examined {{as one of the}} most important behavioral variables. The differences in crowd walking speeds were carefully noted in analyzing the effects of adding individuals with disabilities and the impacts of different indoor <b>walking</b> <b>facilities.</b> Results showed that the presence of individuals with disabilities in a crowd significantly reduces the overall crowd speed. Statistical analysis also provided to compare walking speeds of pedestrian groups involving individuals with disabilities in different walking environments. Secondly, the dissertation proposed a framework to study the interactions of different pedestrian groups. Specifically, a mixed time headway distribution model was used to examine the time headway between followers and different leader types. In addition, the implications of interaction behaviors were studied based on the capacity of the queuing area behind the doorway. Results revealed that: (1) individuals with disabilities had significant effects on capacity reduction; (2) individuals with visual impairments and non-motorized ambulatory devices had the minimum capacity reduction effects in queuing area; and (2) individuals with motorized wheelchairs and individuals with mobility canes had the maximum capacity reduction effects in queuing area. Lastly, this study explored how a heterogeneous mix of pedestrians (including individuals with disabilities) perceive and evaluate operational performance of <b>walking</b> <b>facilities.</b> Both trajectory and survey data sources were used, and an ordered statistical approach was applied to analyze pedestrian perceptions. Results indicated that individuals with disabilities were less tolerant of extreme congested environments.

40|$|Abstract Background Current {{knowledge}} {{on the relationship}} between the physical environment and walking for transportation among older adults (≥ 65 [*]years) is limited. Qualitative research can provide valuable information and inform further research. However, qualitative studies are scarce and fail to include neighborhood outings necessary to study participants’ experiences and perceptions while interacting with and interpreting the local social and physical environment. The current study sought to uncover the perceived environmental influences on Flemish older adults’ walking for transportation. To get detailed and context-sensitive environmental information, it used walk-along interviews. Methods Purposeful convenience sampling was used to recruit 57 older adults residing in urban or semi-urban areas. Walk-along interviews to and from a destination (e. g. a shop) located within a 15 minutes’ walk from the participants’ home were conducted. Content analysis was performed using NVivo 9 software (QSR International). An inductive approach was used to derive categories and subcategories from the data. Results Data were categorized in the following categories and subcategories: access to facilities (shops & services, public transit, connectivity), <b>walking</b> <b>facilities</b> (sidewalk quality, crossings, legibility, benches), traffic safety (busy traffic, behavior of other road users), familiarity, safety from crime (physical factors, other persons), social contacts, aesthetics (buildings, natural elements, noise & smell, openness, decay) and weather. Conclusions The findings indicate that to promote walking for transportation a neighborhood should provide good access to shops and services, well-maintained <b>walking</b> <b>facilities,</b> aesthetically appealing places, streets with little traffic and places for social interaction. In addition, the neighborhood environment should evoke feelings of familiarity and safety from crime.
