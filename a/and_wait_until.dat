5|$|As Khalid was the {{architect}} {{of most of the}} early Muslim military doctrines, he was also the pioneer of almost every major tactic that Muslims used during Early Islamic conquests. One of Khalid's major achievements in this context was utilizing the individual skills of Arab Bedouin warriors to a larger scale. He is believed to have developed them into an almost regular unit called Mubarizun ("champions"), who would issue personal challenges to the enemy officers. These were highly trained and skilled swordsmen, whom Khalid utilized effectively to slay as many enemy officers as possible, giving a psychological blow to enemy morale. The Battle of Ajnadayn is perhaps the best example of this form of psychological warfare. Moreover, his biggest achievement was the conversion of Arab tactical doctrine into a strategic system. Until Khalid, the Arabs were basically raiders and skirmishers. Khalid turned those skirmishing tactics into something that could be used anywhere. Thus he would skirmish the enemy to death: he would bring his army in front of his enemies <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the whole battle degenerated into a skirmishing affair between small units. Then, after exhausting the enemy units, he would launch his cavalry at their flanks employing Hammer and Anvil tactics.|$|E
5|$|The second common parasitoid, Elasmus polistis, {{also has}} {{disastrous}} {{effects on the}} P. exclamans nest. Up to 80 E. polistis will hatch out of a single cell. The males emerge first, and then will exit the nest <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the females emerge. Once the female moths emerge, the males will mate and reproduce, quickly destroying the P. exclamans population. In some cases the invading E. polistis will hide larvae in the nest so that the P.exclamans cannot find them. This {{is important to the}} survival of P.exclamans. The hosts will attempt to remove as many parasitoids as possible to prevent them from spreading to nearby nests. This defense mechanism has not been proven to be effective, as more often than not the E. polistis larvae go undetected by the hosts. In one experiment conducted, it was found that over 60% of all nests lost brood to the parasitoids E. polistis or C. iphitalis in 1981. It was also observed that larger satellites have a greater risk of being parasitized. This {{is due to the fact}} that the large nests are typically older. This relationship between age and parasitism can be seen with the fact that older queens’ nests tend to be parasitized more than younger queens’ nests.|$|E

25|$|Nesting {{most often}} occurs at night for {{protection}} from predators. The prime season for nesting is from December to June, butr peak months are January through March. Females are uneasy when coming ashore. If they feel threatened, they return to the water <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the shore is safer. Approximately two months after nesting the hatchlings emerge. They are around 46mm long when hatched, smaller than other Chelonia hatchlings.|$|E
25|$|On 12 April 1940, {{the first}} convoys of Allied {{soldiers}} were sent under Major-General Pierse Joseph Mackesy to Narvik. The Admiralty urged Mackesy {{to conduct an}} assault on Narvik from the sea as soon as possible. However, Mackesy believed that the German harbour defences were too strong for such an invasion to take place. The Admiralty argued that a naval bombardment of Norway would enable the troops to land safely, but General Mackesy refused to subject Norwegian citizens to such a bombardment, and instead he chose to land his troops near Narvik <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the snow melted {{to take over the}} town.|$|E
25|$|During the {{majority}} of the year caribou roam the tundra in small herds, but twice a year large herds of caribou cross the inland regions. Caribou have excellent senses of smell and hearing so that the hunters must be very careful when in pursuit. Often, Inuit hunters set up camp miles away from the caribou crossing <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> they are in full view to attack. There are many ways in which the caribou can be captured, including spearing, forcing caribou into the river, using blinders, scaring the caribou, and stalking the caribou. When spearing caribou, hunters put the string of the spear in their mouths and the other end they use to gently spear the animal.|$|E

Together, Ellis and Kuipers intercept the fleeing Akkermans, who is hiding in a coffin in a hearse with the stolen money, gold and jewels. They quickly kill the driver, and while Kuipers drives the hearse, Ellis screws down the coffin's secret air vents. They drive to Hollands Diep where the SS trap had been sprung, <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> Akkermans suffocates.

25|$|In January 2017, Cagayan de Oro, {{along with}} other parts of Visayas and Mindanao, was {{impacted}} {{by a combination of}} a low-pressure area and the tail-end of a cold front. The heavy rain inundated many streets, stranding many commuters. At the University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines (USTP), about 900-1,000 students were trapped as most of their campus was flooded. The students were forced to climb to the upper floors of the school's buildings <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> rescue arrived. The city's shopping malls on Claro M. Recto Avenue were also severely affected, with Limketkai Center completely inundated by the floodwaters. A basement parking area of a mall at the corner of Corrales St. was covered with water, while another one near Bitan-ag Creek was flooded as well, even though the area was elevated.|$|E
25|$|While {{hunting in}} the dark depths, {{elephant}} seals seem to locate their prey at least partly by vision; the bioluminescence of some prey animals can facilitate their capture. Elephant seals {{do not have a}} developed a system of echolocation in the manner of cetaceans, but their vibrissae, which are sensitive to vibrations, are assumed {{to play a role in}} search of food. Males and females differ in diving behavior. Males tend to hug the continental shelf while making deep dives and forage along the bottom, while females have more jagged routes and forage in the open ocean. Males return to the same feeding ground every year, while females have less predictable feeding migrations. Elephant seals are prey for killer whales and white sharks. Both are most likely to hunt pups, and seldom hunt large bull elephant seals, but have taken seals of all ages. The shark, when hunting adults, is most likely to ambush a seal with a damaging bite <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> it is weakened by blood loss to finish the kill.|$|E

25|$|Hannibal, {{after his}} plundering mission was completed, {{decided to leave}} the plain, {{choosing}} not to winter there. While Fabius, with secure supply lines, had the luxury to sit <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> his term as dictator expired or the Carthaginians finally attacked him, Hannibal, having stripped the area bare of all supplies, could not afford to stay put indefinitely and ultimately face a supply shortage. The Romans, guided by Fabius, still refused to attack him despite whatever provocation he came up with. Hannibal, on the other hand, did not wish to suffer severe casualties by a head-on assault on the Romans settled in fortified camps on the high ground. Since both commanders sought to fight on favorable conditions, the stalemate continued. The Carthaginian army finally moved east towards the pass beside Mount Callicula through which they had originally entered the plain. Fabius, anticipating the move, had blocked the pass with 4,000 troops, and encamped on a nearby hill with the main army. Minucius then joined this army with his contingent.|$|E
25|$|Following minor {{appearances}} in several films, Hepburn {{starred in the}} 1951 Broadway play Gigi after being spotted by French novelist Colette, on whose work the play was based. She shot to stardom for playing the lead role in Roman Holiday (1953), for which {{she was the first}} actress to win an Academy Award, a Golden Globe and a BAFTA Award for a single performance. The same year Hepburn won a Tony Award for Best Lead Actress in a Play for her performance in Ondine. She went on to star in a number of successful films, such as Sabrina (1954), The Nun's Story (1959), Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), Charade (1963), My Fair Lady (1964) <b>and</b> <b>Wait</b> <b>Until</b> Dark (1967), for which she received Academy Award, Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations.

In recognition of her film career, she was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award from BAFTA, the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award, the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award and the Special Tony Award. She remains one of the 12 people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy and Tony Awards.|$|E
25|$|The {{unit was}} joined with {{remnants}} of several routed regiments and fought its way towards Warsaw. The unit got {{surrounded by the}} Red Army in the Biebrza River area and suffered serious casualties, but managed {{to break through the}} enemy defences. After that ppłk. Dąmbrowski, the commander of the regiment, decided to disband it. Major Henryk Dobrzański took command over approximately 180 men and who decided to continue their march towards the besieged capital. Among his men was Maciej Kalenkiewicz, who became the {{chief of staff of the}} Detached Unit of the Polish Army, as the new unit was called. When Warsaw capitulated on September 27, Dobrzański decided to continue the fight against foreign occupation of Poland. Approximately 50 men volunteered to stay in the army, while the rest were allowed to leave. On November 1, 1939, they crossed the Vistula near Dęblin and started their march towards the Holy Cross Mountains. The same day his unit fought the first skirmish against the Germans. After that he decided to stay in the Kielce area with his unit <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the Allied relief comes, which he expected in the Spring of 1940. Two days afterwards Kalenkiewicz became the deputy commander of what was to become the first partisan unit of World War II. He adopted a nom de guerre of Kotwicz, after the name of his family's Coat of Arms.|$|E

500|$|Before dawn on November 16, the British and Hessian troops moved out. Knyphausen and {{his troops}} were ferried across the Harlem River on flatboats {{and landed on}} Manhattan.

500|$|To {{ward off}} the threat of vampires and disease, twin {{brothers}} would yoke twin oxen to a plow and make a furrow with it around their village.

500|$|Unlike most action games, stealth games {{challenge}} the player to avoid alerting enemies altogether. The core gameplay {{elements of the}} modern stealth game are to avoid combat, minimize noise, and strike enemies from the shadows. Completing objectives without being detected by any enemy, {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "ghosting" [...] is a common approach to stealth games. Avoiding detection may {{be the only way to}} successfully complete a game, but there are usually multiple ways to achieve a goal with different pathways or styles of play. Players can hide behind objects or in shadows, and can strike or run past an enemy when the enemy is facing the other way. If the player attracts the attention of enemies, they usually must hide <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the enemies abandon their search. Thus, planning becomes important, as does trial-and-error. However, some stealth games put more emphasis on physical combat skill when the player is spotted. Some games offer a choice between killing or merely knocking out an enemy. When ghosting is optional, or even not well-supported by a game, players may still attempt to avoid combat for moral reasons or as a demonstration of skill.|$|E
