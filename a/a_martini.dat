25|$|The Montgomery {{cocktail}} is <b>a</b> <b>martini</b> mixed at a {{ratio of}} 15 parts gin to 1 part vermouth, and popular with Ernest Hemingway at Harry's Bar in Venice. The drink was facetiously named for Montgomery's supposed refusal to go into battle unless his numerical advantage was at least fifteen to one, and it appeared in Hemingway's 1950 novel Across the River and into the Trees. Ironically, following severe internal injuries received in the First World War, Montgomery himself could neither smoke nor drink.|$|E
500|$|The {{instruction}} was honoured by the AFI as the 90th most-memorable cinema quotation. In order to distance {{his version of}} Bond from Sean Connery's, Roger Moore did not order <b>a</b> <b>martini.</b> The martini was present in the first Ian Fleming novel, Casino Royale, where Bond eventually named it [...] "The Vesper", after Vesper Lynd. The same recipe was then used for the 2006 film of the novel, with the martini ordered by Daniel Craig's Bond.|$|E
500|$|A lemon drop is {{typically}} prepared straight up, {{meaning that it}} is shaken or stirred with ice, strained, and served in a stemmed glass, such as <b>a</b> <b>martini</b> glass. The glass may be prepared with a sugared rim, performed by dipping {{the rim of the}} glass in water or lemon juice and then dipping it into a rimmer (a shallow tray used in bartending), filled with sugar. Superfine sugar (also called [...] "bar sugar", [...] "caster sugar", [...] "castor sugar" [...] and [...] "ultrafine sugar"), which is more finely ground compared to standard granulated sugar, is sometimes used for this purpose.|$|E

50|$|While {{properly}} {{called a}} Bradford, <b>a</b> shaken <b>martini</b> also appears cloudier than when stirred. This {{is caused by}} the small fragments of ice present in <b>a</b> shaken <b>martini.</b> This also brings into question the movie versions, which are never cloudy.|$|R
500|$|Although the Algonquin was [...] "dry" [...] {{even before}} Prohibition (Case closed the hotel bar in 1917 and had harsh words {{for those who}} ran speakeasies), the hotel does have an eponymous cocktail, {{composed}} of rye whiskey, Noilly Prat and pineapple juice. More recently, a newer drink has hit the Algonquin's menu, the $10,000 Martini or [...] "Martini on the Rock," [...] consisting of <b>a</b> <b>martini</b> of the buyer's choice with {{a single piece of}} [...] "ice," [...] a diamond, {{at the bottom of the}} glass. The martini was developed to mark completion of a major 29-day renovation that closed the hotel for the first time since its opening. Hoy Wong was a notable bartender at the hotel and was the oldest person to hold such a position in the state, serving at the Algonquin for 30 years until retiring in 2009, well past the age of 90.|$|E

2500|$|Following Joe's eviction, the HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Getting Schooled" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were asked true or false {{questions}} {{in the style of}} classic high school classes such as History and Geography. Providing an incorrect answer resulted in a HouseGuests elimination; the last HouseGuest remaining was the winner. Dick was the winner. On Day 21, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Mission InPastaBowl" [...] food competition. For this competition, HouseGuests paired off to jump into two bowls of giant pasta which contained meatballs, each with different types of food written on them. The pairs had match up a specific [...] "meatball" [...] from tub A and tub B. When the two HouseGuests matched their meatballs, they won that food for the week. When the time ran out, the House would win any food collected in the competition. That same day, Dick chose to nominate Jen and Kail for eviction. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Jessica, Nick, and Zach were selected to play; Eric was selected to host. On Day 22, HouseGuests competed in the [...] "Mad Hatter" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests stood on top of a pedestal while balancing <b>a</b> <b>martini</b> glass on their head. The last HouseGuest remaining who hadn't dropped their cup would be the winner. Jen was the winner. During the competition, Mike told Dick to nominate him should the Veto be used, as Mike felt it would show the others that he was a loyal person. On Day 24, Jen chose to use the Power of Veto to remove herself from the block, with Mike being nominated in her place. On Day 27, Mike became the third HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a vote of seven to two.|$|E
