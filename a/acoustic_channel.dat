50|$|In pinnipeds, {{mothers and}} pups are {{frequently}} separated throughout nursing {{and are thus}} expected to have evolved an efficient individual recognition system. Consequentially, in Australian sea lions, as in many social mammals, mothers and their offspring can identify each other. Individual recognition produces mutual benefits by avoiding misdirected maternal care and therefore energy expenditure for mothers, {{and the risk of}} injury for young approaching unrelated, potentially dangerous, adult females. Individual recognition can be accomplished with a combination of several sensory modalities, including olfaction, vision, and audition. The use of olfactory cues as a close range recognition mechanism allows mothers to further confirm their pup’s identity. In contrast to recent olfactory studies in pinnipeds which showed the presence but not a natural function of olfaction in pinnipeds, the present study shows that wild Australian sea lions use their olfactory abilities in a functional manner, by discrimination between the scents of their own offspring and a non-filial pup. However, in a dynamic, crowded colony, the <b>acoustic</b> <b>channel</b> seems to be the most reliable modality.

40|$|Abstract. Underwater <b>acoustic</b> <b>channel</b> is {{the biggest}} {{obstacle}} which causes the underwater acoustic communication falling behind the wireless communication. Generally speaking, underwater <b>acoustic</b> <b>channel</b> will represent doubly spread, i. e. multipath spread and Doppler spread. Also the multipath spread will be quite long in the underwater <b>acoustic</b> <b>channel.</b> For example, the multipath spread will be several milliseconds in the shallow sea and several seconds in the deep sea. Multipath spread will lead to Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI), and Doppler spread will cause the channel to be rapidly time-varying. Although ISI can be suppressed by channel equalizer, {{but because of the}} long multipath spread, it increases the complexity about the design of the equalizer. In this paper, channel shortening will be used to reduce the ISI. We present two methods of channel shorting, which are Time Reversal (TR) filter and the Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) filter. When the two filters are used in FH-FSK, we found that the performance of MMSE filter is better than TR filter. Taking into account the characteristics of sparse underwater <b>acoustic</b> <b>channel,</b> Compressive Sensing (CS) algorithm is used for channel estimation. Finally, We perform a series of numerical simulations and the experiments on the lake to show that MMSE filter outperformances the TR filter under the FH-FSK system using the bit error rate (BER) as an evaluation criterion...|$|E

To this end, we introduce an adaptive piecewise linear equalization algorithm that not only adapts the linear equalizer at each region but also learns the complete hierarchical structure with a computational complexity only polynomial in the number of nodes of the tree. Furthermore, our algorithm is constructed to directly minimize the final squared error without introducing any ad-hoc parameters.
