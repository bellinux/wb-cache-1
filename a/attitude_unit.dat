40|$|After {{establishing}} {{an association between}} human resource (HR) practices, organizational performance and employee outcomes, research has increasingly focussed on the processes that shape this association such as the role of AMO theory {{and the effectiveness of}} HR implementation. Another process that has been highlighted by Nishii and colleagues (2008) is role of HR attributions. They explored how employee attributions about why specific HR practices had been implemented affected organizational outcomes. They showed that HR practices attributed to concern for quality and employee enhancement were positively associated, and HR practices attributed to concern for cost minimization and employee exploitation were negatively associated with employee <b>attitudes,</b> <b>unit</b> level organizational citizenship behaviours and customer satisfaction. Union compliance attributions had a neutral impact on outcomes. Nishii et al’s (2008) study focussed on the links between employee attributions, employee attitudes and behaviour and unit level outcomes. What remains unclear and unexplored is how attributions about the purpose of HR practices affects employee well-being. We therefore build on the research of Nishii et al to focus specifically on the association between employee attributions and employee well-being. We hypothesised that quality and employee enhancement attributions and union attributions would be positively associated with well-being and cost minimization and employee exploitation attributions would be negatively associated. Data were collected from 300 airline company workers on attributions and a range of well-being-related outcomes. Our study confirms the 3 factor structure of Nishii et al’s measure of HR attributions. Findings confirm that quality and employee enhancement HR attributions are positively associated with job satisfaction, life satisfaction and engagement and negatively associated with stress. In contrast, cost and employee exploitation HR attributions are associated with lower satisfaction and engagement. Contrary to our hypothesis, union compliance HR attributions among highly unionized technical workers were negatively associated with job satisfaction, engagement and employability. Among low unionized managerial and administrative workers the impact of union compliance attributions on attitudes is neutral. Our study provides empirical support for the usefulness of the construct of HR attributions in understanding the link between HR practices and employee outcomes, confirming that, in addition to the Nishii et al findings of the impact on behaviour and unit level outcomes, attributions affect employee well-being. Our findings also raise questions about the role of external HR attributions, and of union attributions in particular, in shaping employee outcomes...|$|R

In this paper, we {{address the problem of}} combine harvester control using a single CP-DGPS receiver, without any <b>attitude</b> measurement <b>unit.</b> A non linear, velocity independent control law has been designed. It relies upon the kinematic model of the combine harvester. Two approaches aimed at estimating the heading of the farm vehicle have been investigated. One uses GPS velocity measurements: the kinematic model of the harvester imposes that its linear velocity is directed along the vehicle axle. So the heading of the vehicle can be roughly estimated from raw velocity measurements. The other relies upon a Kalman state reconstructor and produces an indirect measurement of the heading. The reconstructor has been designed thanks to the kinematic model of the harvester, and taking into account for the sensor noise. The control law has been implemented on a combine harvester. Experiments have been carried out using both kinds of heading estimations on an almost flat ground. The standard deviation from the mean of the lateral position is about three centimeters, and the bias smaller than five centimeters. Both methods are compared an some conclusions are drawn...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe NAPALM project {{addresses}} {{a new and}} revolutionary space propulsion system, able to deliver a very high specific impulse through a new working fluid and accelerator principle for the electric plasma thruster. The new motor will impressively exceed, by between ten and sixty percent, the vacuum specific impulse of all existing electric and thermo-electric rocket engines. The accomplishment {{is based on a}} new working medium, comprised of relatively high-mass gasified nanoparticles that will be accelerated up to very high kinetic energies. While all current electric thrusters are only able to deliver up to 15. 000 s specific impulse, the new thruster is expected to deliver between 18. 000 and over 30. 000 s specific impulse. This extraordinary property will increase in the equal amount the deliverable ideal velocity during an interplanetary mission. This increased exit velocity conveys into an equal amount of propellant saving, for any equivalent mission performance. Within the range of low thrust levels, a particularly efficient application of the new thruster is in the attitude control of orbital spacecraft, which will save large amounts of propellant, in comparison to the chemical <b>attitude</b> control <b>units</b> and to other existing electrical thrusters.
