The valley is home to fifteen of the sixteen bats found in England including a roost, at Compton Martin Ochre Mine, for greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). A rare and endangered species, the greater horseshoe bat is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is listed in <b>Annex</b> <b>II</b> of the 1992 European Community Habitats Directive.|$|E
25|$|The Schengen area mostly {{functions}} as a single country for international travel purposes, with a common visa policy. Since 2001, the European Union has issued two lists regarding visas for the Schengen Area: a white list of countries whose nationals do not require visas (<b>Annex</b> <b>II)</b> and a black list of countries whose nationals do require visas (Annex I). As per Regulation No 539/2001 (amended by Regulation No 1289/2013) reciprocity is required from all <b>Annex</b> <b>II</b> countries and territories. That means that these countries must offer visa-free access for 90 days to citizens of Norway and the other Schengen member states.|$|E

25|$|Before {{accession}} to the European Union, Croatia was categorised as an <b>Annex</b> <b>II</b> country, {{which meant that}} Croatian citizens could stay in the Schengen Area without a visa for up to 90 days in a 180-day period. Croatian citizens were also able to stay without a visa in Bulgaria, Cyprus, Ireland and Romania for up to 90 days in each country, {{as well as in}} the United Kingdom for up to 6 months.|$|E
25|$|As {{noted in}} the {{preceding}} section, between 1990–1999, {{there was a large}} reduction in the emissions of the EITs. The reduction in the EITs is largely responsible for the total (aggregate) reduction (excluding LULUCF) in emissions of the Annex I countries, excluding the US. Emissions of the <b>Annex</b> <b>II</b> countries (Annex I minus the EIT countries) have experienced a limited increase in emissions from 1990–2006, followed by stabilization and a more marked decrease from 2007 onwards. The emissions reductions in the early nineties by the 12 EIT countries who have since joined the EU, assist the present EU-27 in meeting its collective Kyoto target.|$|E
25|$|At many {{external}} border crossing points, there are special lanes for EU, EEA and Swiss citizens (as {{well as their}} family members) and other lanes for all travellers regardless of nationality. At some {{external border}} crossing points, {{there is a third}} type of lane for travellers who are <b>Annex</b> <b>II</b> nationals (i.e. non-EU/EEA/Swiss citizens who are exempt from the visa requirement). Although Andorran and San Marinese citizens are not EU or EEA citizens, they are nonetheless able to use the special lanes designated for EU, EEA and Swiss citizens. British citizens {{will not be able to}} use the EU lane after Brexit as the rules stand, unless such a right are negotiated into the Brexit agreement with the EU.|$|E

25|$|Even though Turkey is a {{candidate}} country for the membership in the European Union, it has a more complex visa policy than the Visa policy of the Schengen Area. Turkey requires visas from citizens of certain EU member states and Schengen <b>Annex</b> <b>II</b> countries and territories – Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bahamas, Barbados, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Dominica, East Timor, Grenada, Ireland, Kiribati, Malta, Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Mexico, Micronesia, Norway, Netherlands, Palau, Poland, Portugal, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Spain, Taiwan, Tonga, Tuvalu, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, and Vanuatu. On the other hand, Turkey grants visa-free access to citizens of countries and territories – Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belize, Bolivia, Ecuador, Iran, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, Jordan, Lebanon, Mongolia, Morocco, Qatar, Russia, Tajikistan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.|$|E
25|$|As {{shown by}} the table above, because many {{procedures}} are optional, border guards have discretion in deciding how rigorously they check travellers at external border crossing points. As a result, {{the length of time}} taken to perform checks differs between Schengen countries. Under the previous regime (whereby those with the right to freedom of movement were subject only to a 'minimum check'), an entry check for an EU, EEA or Swiss citizen took around five seconds on average in Italy, whilst in Norway, on average it took around 1 minute. The disparities in checks on third-country nationals (who are subject to a more thorough check) are even greater. For example, an entry check for an <b>Annex</b> <b>II</b> national takes around 15 seconds on average in Greece, whilst it takes three to five minutes on average in Slovakia. Similarly, an entry check for an Annex I national on average lasts around 30–60 seconds in The Netherlands, whilst in Latvia, it lasts around two to five minutes on average.|$|E
25|$|People born in Kosovo or {{otherwise}} legally settled in Kosovo are by law considered Serbian nationals {{and as such}} {{they are entitled to}} a Serbian passport. However, these passports are not issued by the Serbian Ministry of the Interior. Instead they are issued by the Serbian Coordination Directorate. These particular passports do not allow the holder to enter the Schengen Area without a visa for a stay of less than three months within half a year, while Serbian citizens with passports issued by the Serbian Ministry of the Interior enjoy such a privilege. Bearers of passports issued by the Serbian Coordination Directorate require Schengen visa for travel to Schengen area since they are not covered by the <b>Annex</b> <b>II</b> list of countries allowed visa free entry to the Schengen Area. The European Union considered it impossible for Serbia to evaluate the issuing of breeder documents needed to apply for a passport and the integrity of the procedures applied by Serbia to check the authenticity of documents provided by applicants for that purpose.|$|E

25|$|As per Regulation No 539/2001 (amended by Regulation No 1289/2013) {{reciprocity}} {{is required}} from all <b>Annex</b> <b>II</b> countries and territories. That means that these countries must offer visa-free access for 90 days to all EU citizens (except citizens of Ireland and the United Kingdom) {{and to the}} citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. When this is not the case, the affected EU or Schengen member state is expected to notify the European Commission. Starting six months after the notification, the Commission may adopt an implementing act to suspend the visa-free regime for certain categories of nationals of the third country concerned, for a period of up to six months, with a possible prolongation by further periods of up to six months. If the Commission decides not to adopt such an act, it has to present a report explaining the reasons why it did not propose the measure. If after two years from the notification the third country is still requiring visas from citizens of one or more Member States, the Commission shall adopt a delegated act to re-impose the visa obligation on all citizens of the third country, for a period of 12 months. Either the European Parliament or the Council could oppose the entry into force of the delegated acts. All of the states that implement the common visa rules – including Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania – may notify the European Commission about non-compliant third states.|$|E
