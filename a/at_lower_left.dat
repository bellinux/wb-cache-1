5|$|The watercolourist Moses Harris (1731–1785), {{known for}} his The Aurelian or natural history of English insects (1766), {{published}} in 1780, the first scientific descriptions of several Odonata including the banded demoiselle, Calopteryx splendens. He was the first English artist to make illustrations of dragonflies accurate enough to be identified to species (Aeshna grandis at top left of plate illustrated), though his rough drawing of a larva (<b>at</b> <b>lower</b> <b>left)</b> with the mask extended appears to be plagiarised.|$|E
25|$|Roger Williams led a {{group of}} {{followers}} to Providence, Rhode Island. The settlement was commemorated with a 3-cent stamp on the 300th anniversary, May 4, 1936. The statue depicted stands near the State House. The state seal of Rhode Island is <b>at</b> <b>lower</b> <b>left.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{notes were}} {{designed}} by Miroslav Šutej and Vilko Žiljak, and all feature prominent Croatians on front and architectural motifs on back. The geometric figures <b>at</b> <b>lower</b> <b>left</b> on front (except the 5-kuna note) are intaglio printed for recognition by the sight-impaired. To {{the right of the}} coat of arms on front is a microprinted version of the Croatian national anthem, Lijepa naša domovino (Our Beautiful Homeland). The overall design is reminiscent of Deutsche Mark banknotes of the fourth series.|$|E

2500|$|The Twelve Apostles {{are crowded}} {{to the left}} of Christ and behind him. [...] The younger man {{standing}} at the left, seen in profile, is Saint John the Evangelist, and the bearded kneeling man <b>at</b> <b>lower</b> <b>left</b> is Saint Peter, given an orange overgarment, as often in art. [...] The others are probably not intended to be individually identifiable. [...] By this stage of the High Renaissance, not even Christ is given a halo, making it harder to pick out any specific individuals from the crowd that the gospel account mentions. [...] Michael Levey said the painting was [...] "full of obvious portrait heads", but there has been much much less speculation as to the individuals with inserted likenesses than for Raphael's The School of Athens of a few years earlier.|$|E

2500|$|A {{critical}} {{commentary on}} the press's treatment of Andrew Jackson, and on the practice of nominating candidates by caucus during the presidential race of 1824 with James Akin's cartoon pointedly attacks Republican nominee William Crawford and his powerful supporter Martin Van Buren. Jackson, in military uniform, stands amid a pack of snarling dogs labeled {{with the names of}} various critical newspapers. He rests his right hand upon a sword inscribed [...] "Veni Vidi Vici." [...] One dog, named [...] "Richmond Whig," [...] is whipped by a nude black boy who says, [...] "Mas Andra I earry say dis eah jew dog blongst to Tunis, bark loud, somebody tief way ee paper & show um one ghose, wite like Clay; dat mak um feard. Name o' God! nobody gwine feard now for Crawfud ghose! look pon dat sleepy dog; jumbee da ride um, can't bark no mo for Crawfud." [...] In the lower left corner a dog named [...] "Democratic Press" [...] is ridden by a skeletal Death figure holding aloft a tract with the words [...] "Immortal memory Revd. James Quigley basely sacrificed conscience Avaunt!" [...] On the dog's side appear the words, [...] "Good sprite, In mercy lash me with a dry corn stalk; I'm so jaded by stable swooning smoke house steams & Hog Cellar sweats!" [...] A five-headed dog named [...] "Hartford Convention" [...] also appears <b>at</b> <b>lower</b> <b>left.</b> In the left background, before a building marked [...] "Uncle Sam's Treasury Pap House / Amalgamation-Tool Department," [...] Treasury Secretary William Crawford offers a bowl of dollars to a befeathered woman, saying [...] "Here's a bowl full of solid pappose [...] meat. that's a good Girl better marry our wild, Indians than Foreigners good or bad." [...] She says, [...] "O! stuff your mouth you brat! Treasury pap is better than rum." [...] An Indian beside her says, [...] "Rum for de baby." [...] Below the image is a text from Shakespeare's Coriolanus: [...] "What would you have, you Curs, that like not peace, nor war? / Who deserves Greatness, deserves your hate; and your affections are a sick man's appetite. / With every minute you do change a mind: and call him noble that was now your hate. / Him vile that was your Garland!" ...|$|E
