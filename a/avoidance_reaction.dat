50|$|Movement of Paramecium {{cells is}} caused by control of calcium ions inside the cell and {{membrane}} potentials.

40|$|Studies {{examining}} {{approach and}} <b>avoidance</b> <b>reactions</b> to emotional expressions have yielded conflicting results. For example, expressions of anger {{have been reported}} to elicit approach reactions in some studies but <b>avoidance</b> <b>reactions</b> in others. Nonetheless, the results were often explained by the same general underlying process, namely the influence that the social message signaled by the expression has on motivational responses. It is therefore unclear which reaction is triggered by which emotional expression, and which underlying process is responsible for these reactions. In order to address this issue, we examined the role of a potential moderator on approach and <b>avoidance</b> <b>reactions</b> to emotional expres-sions, namely the contrast emotion used in the task. We believe that different approach and <b>avoidance</b> <b>reactions</b> occur depending on the congruency or incongruency of the evaluation of the 2 emotions presented in the task. The results from a series of experiments supported these assumptions: Negative emotional expressions (anger, fear, sadness) elicited <b>avoidance</b> <b>reactions</b> if contrasted with expressions of happiness. However, if contrasted with a different negative emotional expression, anger and sadness triggered approach reactions and fear activated <b>avoidance</b> <b>reactions.</b> Importantly, these results also emerged if the emotional expression was not task-relevant. We propose that approach and <b>avoidance</b> <b>reactions</b> to emotional expressions are triggered by their evaluation if the 2 emotions presented in a task differ in evaluative connotation. If they have the same evaluative connotation, however, reactions are determined by their social message...|$|R

50|$|Women have {{on average}} {{stronger}} avoidance reactions to moderately negative stimuli. They point to negative news {{as the main}} reason for avoiding international news. The stronger <b>avoidance</b> <b>reaction</b> to moderately negative stimuli can be explained evolutionary as it being the role of men to investigate and potentially respond aggressively to the threat while women and children withdraw. Men and women also differ on average on how they enjoy, evaluate, remember, comprehend, and identify with the people in negative news depending on if the news are negatively or positively framed. One explanation may that the negative news are framed according to male preferences by the often male journalists who cover such news and that a more positive framing may attract a larger female audience.|$|E
5000|$|In 1921, {{the strong}} {{reaction}} of Physa to contact with leeches was first observed, and later {{studies have also}} been made. The observations are restricted to Physa fontinalis, an indigenous species to areas with indigenous predatory leeches, and Haitia acuta, introduced in Germany and the Netherlands. When Physa contacts another snail, either Physa or some other kind, the reaction is a rapid twisting of the shell {{back and forth to}} dislodge the other. The muscle used is the [...] "physid muscle", not found in other Hygrophila, which therefore do not show this reaction. The leech-avoidance reaction carries the action one step further: on contact with a leech the snail twists its shell violently and detaches its foot from the substratum as well.The reaction of two species of Physids to various species of leeches and to various salts was studied. In Haitia acute, the <b>avoidance</b> <b>reaction</b> was much less pronounced than in Physa fontinalis. The highest percentage of reactions in Physa were obtained with the two species of leeches that feed chiefly on snails. The nature of the substance that produces the reaction is undetermined, but presumably it is a protein.|$|E

The {{present study was}} designed to investigate predator avoidance of extremophile populations of Poecilia mexicana and P. sulphuraria that either live in hydrogen sulfide-rich (sulfidic) springs or cave habitats, both of which are known to have impoverished piscine predator regimes. Focal fishes that inhabited sulfidic springs showed slightly weaker <b>avoidance</b> <b>reactions</b> when presented with several naturally occurring predatory cichlids, but strongest differences to populations from non-sulfidic habitats were found in a decreased shoaling tendency with non-predatory swordtail (Xiphophorus hellerii) females. When comparing <b>avoidance</b> <b>reactions</b> between P. mexicana from a sulfidic cave (Cueva del Azufre) and the adjacent sulfidic surface creek (El Azufre), we found only slight differences in predator avoidance, but surface fish reacted much more strongly to the non-predatory cichlid Vieja bifasciata. Our third experiment was designed to disentangle learned from innate effects of predator recognition. We compared laboratory-reared (i. e., predator-naïve) and wild-caught (i. e., predator-experienced) individuals of P. mexicana from a non-sulfidic river and found no differences in their reaction towards the presented predators.

50|$|Rabies {{was once}} {{rare in the}} United States outside the Southern states, but {{raccoons}} in the mid-Atlantic and northeast United States have been suffering from a rabies epidemic since the 1970s, that is now moving westwards into Ohio. Most westward expansion has been prevented via the action of Oral Rabies Vaccination (ORV) programs. The particular {{variant of the virus}} has been identified in the southeastern United States raccoon population since the 1950s, and is believed to have traveled to the northeast as the result of infected raccoons being among those caught and transported from the southeast to the northeast by human hunters attempting to replenish the declining northeast raccoon population. As a result, urban residents of these areas have become more wary of the large but normally unseen urban raccoon population. Whether as a result of increased vigilance or only the common human <b>avoidance</b> <b>reaction</b> to any other animal not normally seen, such as a raccoon, there has only been one documented human rabies case {{as a result of this}} variant. This does not include, however, the greatly increasing rate of prophylactic rabies treatments in cases of possible exposure, which numbered fewer than one hundred humans annually in the state of New York before 1990, for instance, but rose to approximately ten thousand annually between 1990 and 1995. At approximately $1,500 per course of treatment, this represents a considerable public health expenditure. Raccoons do constitute approximately 50% of the approximately eight thousand documented non-human rabies cases in the United States. Domestic animals constitute only 8% of rabies cases, but are increasing at a rapid rate.|$|E

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{review of}} all the avoidance apparatus which {{have been used to}} date in chemical avoidance tests and also an analysis of the trends and needs for new improved designs led to the design of a new avoidance apparatus. The new apparatus is a viable tool for analyzing the behavioral responses of fish to potentially toxic effluents in three dimensions. The method is quick, sensitive and relatively easy to use if sufficient fish stock is available. The variable parameters of the <b>avoidance</b> <b>reaction</b> were three: (a) the type of the pollutant, (b) the injection system, and (c) the concentration of the pollutant. Statistical analysis for the experiments included preliminary calculations, time series analysis, analysis of variance and Duncan's tests. Preliminary tests evaluated the general disposition of fish in the channel, the influence of a water acclimation jet and also the effects of noise, light and temperature. Experiments were performed to define the optimal number of fish per experiment, the influence of video analysis and also of variability, adaptability and continuity. The types of pollutants used were D. S. S. (dodecyl sodium sulfate) [...] a well-known reference pollutant, polymers, monomers, a plating industrial effluent and its components (Cr, Ni, Fe). For all of these, horizontal and vertical distributions were produced together with avoidance curves and <b>avoidance</b> <b>reaction</b> representations.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that obstacle <b>avoidance</b> <b>reactions</b> during gait have very short latencies. This raises the question whether the cortex can be involved, as it is in voluntary reactions. In this study, latencies of obstacle <b>avoidance</b> (OA) <b>reactions</b> were determined and related to latencies of voluntary stride modifications and simple reaction times (SRT) of hand and foot. Twenty-five healthy young adults participated in this study. While they were walking on the treadmill, an obstacle suddenly fell in front of their left leg. The first reaction to the obstacle was the moment at which the differentiated acceleration curve of the foot deviated from the control signal. Latencies of OA reactions were 122 ms (SD 14 ms) on average. Two very different <b>avoidance</b> <b>reactions</b> (lengthening and shortening of the stride) were noticed, but there was no avoidance strategy effect on OA latencies. OA latencies were significantly shorter as compared to latencies of voluntary stride modifications and simple reaction times of hand and foot. The short OA latencies could not only be explained from the dynamic nature of the task. It is suggested that subcortical pathways might be involved in obstacle avoidance. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|A {{standard}} methodology {{was developed}} for performing avoidance-preference tests, using Rainbow Trout (Salmo gairdneri) as the test organism. Experiments were conducted in a hydraulic channel, 9. 15 m long by 0. 30 m wide, partly divided along its length, and at a flow depth of 0. 30 m. The design combined steep and shallow gradient characteristics. The toxicants investigated included Cu(II), Cr(III) and Cr(VI). The lowest avoidance threshold values were established at 2. 1 $ mu$g/l for Cu(II) and 0. 0026 mg/l and 0. 026 mg/l for Cr(III) and Cr(VI) respectively while <b>avoidance</b> <b>reactions</b> increased with levels of toxicant in the channel. Similar experiments were performed with rainbow trout which were pre-exposed at sublethal levels to the toxicant, {{in order to assess}} the influence of toxic pre-exposure to the subsequent fish avoidance response. The length of pre-exposure varied between 7 - 20 weeks. Avoidance threshold values were correlated with safe levels of toxicant exposure. Pre-exposed fish exhibited decreasing <b>avoidance</b> <b>reactions</b> compared to non-exposed populations. Increased tolerance to the toxicant, was suggested by the increase in avoidance threshold values with pre-exposure levels. Fish exposed to test concentrations matching their pre-exposure levels, clearly preferred this same concentration over the adjacent lower or higher test concentration. A two mechanism avoidance model was proposed independent of toxicant used or level of pre-exposure. The toxicant concentration where the second mechanism begins to dominate was referred to as avoidance breakpoint, and was correlated to a MATC level for the toxicant in question. Olfactory responses were proposed to be associated with fish avoidance responses below the avoidance breakpoint, while hypoxic stress along with osmo- and iono regulatory stress appeared to be responsible for driving fish <b>avoidance</b> <b>reactions</b> beyond the <b>avoidance</b> breakpoint. A clearance period of 7 days was sufficient to allow fish to recover normal avoidance behaviour following pre-exposure to Cr(VI) below the avoidance breakpoint...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} naval sonar on beaked whales is of {{increasing}} concern.

Assuming that normal diving does not cause nitrogen tensions in excess of those shown to be safe for odontocetes, the modeling indicates that repetitive shallow dives, perhaps {{as a consequence of}} an extended <b>avoidance</b> <b>reaction</b> to sonar sound, can indeed pose a risk for DCS and that this risk should increase with the duration of the response.

40|$|Many {{species of}} whales migrate {{annually}} between high-latitude feeding grounds and low-latitude breeding grounds. Yet, {{very little is}} known about how these animals navigate during these migrations. This thesis takes a first look at the roles of geomagnetic and acoustic cues in humpback whale navigation and orientation, in addition to documenting some effects of human-produced sound on beaked whales. The tracks of satellite-tagged humpback whales migrating from Hawaii to Alaska were found to have systematic deviations from the most direct route to their destination. For each whale, a migration track was modeled using only geomagnetic inclination and intensity as navigation cues. The directions in which the observed and modeled tracks deviated from the direct route were compared and found to match for 7 out of 9 tracks, which suggests that migrating humpback whales may use geomagnetic cues for navigation. Additionally, in all cases the observed tracks followed a more direct route to the destination than the modeled tracks, indicating that the whales are likely using additional navigational cues to improve their routes. There is a significant amount of sound available in the ocean to aid in navigation and orientation of a migrating whale. This research investigates the possibility that humpback whales migrating near-shore listen to sounds of snapping shrimp to detect the presence of obstacles, such as rocky islands. A visual tracking study was used, together with hydrophone recordings near a rocky island, to determine whether the whales initiated an <b>avoidance</b> <b>reaction</b> at distances that varied with the acoustic detection range of the island. No <b>avoidance</b> <b>reaction</b> was found. Propagation modeling of the snapping shrimp sounds suggested that the detection range of the island was beyond the visual limit of the survey, indicating that snapping shrimp sounds may be suited as a long-range indicator of a rocky island. Lastly, this thesis identifies a prolonged <b>avoidance</b> <b>reaction</b> of a Blainville's beaked whale to playbacks of Navy mid-frequency active sonar and orca predation calls. Navy sonar exercises have been linked to beaked whale strandings, and identifying whether these are the result of a mistaken predator <b>avoidance</b> <b>reaction</b> may help prevent future strandings. by Ann Nichole Allen.

40|$|The {{evolutionary}} justification by J. E. LeDoux (1996) for his dual-route {{model of}} fear processing was analyzed computationally by applying genetic algorithms to artificial neural networks. The evolution was simulated of a neural network controlling an agent that gathered food in an artificial {{world and that}} was occasionally menaced by a predator. Connections could not change in the agent's "lifetime,' {{so there was no}} learning in the simulations. Only if the smells of food and predator were hard to distinguish and the fitness reflected time pressures in escaping from the predator did the type of dual processing postulated by LeDoux emerge in the surviving agents. Processing in the "quick and dirty' pathway of the fear system ensured avoidance of both predators and food, but a distinction between food and predator was made only in the long pathway. Elaborate processing inhibited the <b>avoidance</b> <b>reaction</b> and reversed it into an approach reaction to food, but strengthened the <b>avoidance</b> <b>reaction</b> to predators (and more finely tuned the direction of escape).

40|$|The linear-dynamic-stochastic {{model of}} a {{reaction}} latency as applied to avoidance experiment is presented. Reactions are classified {{on the basis of}} the model into following classes: escape, avoidance, late avoidance, three types of inter-trial responses and "no reaction". The experimental latency distribution is split into latency distributions of the escape, avoidance and late avoidance responses, providing a new insight into latency distribution. The results of fitting the model to latency measurements obtained in the avoidance conditioning experiment are presented. The same processes of the parameter changes as in the escape conditioning are discovered, one causing a latency to decrease and the other causing a latency to increase during learning. The first process affects a latency stronger than the second and, consequently, the latency decreases during learning. The second process is responsible for a decay of inter trial-responses during experiment. The value of the correlation coefficient between the threshold of <b>avoidance</b> <b>reaction</b> and the threshold of escape reaction was also estimated. Negative values of this coefficient were obtained, therefore, on the average, the greater the <b>avoidance</b> <b>reaction</b> threshold the smaller the escape one. In the course of learning the correlation coefficient tends to be equal to - 1, i. e., as a result of training, both thresholds became dependent in a functional (non-random) way.

This study examines predictors for mental health services (MHS) utilization among survivors of a man-made disaster in the Netherlands (May 2000). Methods Electronic records of survivors (n = 339; over 18 years and older) registered in a mental health service (MHS) were linked with general practice based electronic medical records (EMRs) of survivors and data obtained in surveys. EMR data were available from 16 months pre-disaster until 3 years post-disaster. Symptoms and diagnoses in the EMRs were coded according to the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC). Surveys were carried out 2 – 3 weeks and 18 months post-disaster, and included validated questionnaires on psychological distress, post-traumatic stress reactions and social functioning. Demographic and disaster-related variables were available. Predisposing factors for MHS utilization 0 – 18 months and 18 – 36 months post-disaster were examined using multiple logistic regression models. Results In multiple logistic models, adjusting for demographic and disaster related variables, MHS utilization was predicted by demographic variables (young age, immigrant, public health insurance, unemployment), disaster-related exposure (relocation and injuries), self-reported psychological problems and pre- and post-disaster physician diagnosed health problems (chronic diseases, musculoskeletal problems). After controlling for all health variables, disaster intrusions and <b>avoidance</b> <b>reactions</b> (OR: 2. 86; CI: 1. 48 – 5. 53), hostility (OR: 2. 04; CI: 1. 28 – 3. 25), pre-disaster chronic diseases (OR: 1. 82; CI: 1. 25 – 2. 65), injuries {{as a result of the}} disaster (OR: 1. 80;CI: 1. 13 – 2. 86), social functioning problems (OR: 1. 61;CI: 1. 05 – 2. 44) and younger age (OR: 0. 98;CI: 0. 96 – 0. 99) predicted MHS utilization within 18 months post-disaster. Furthermore, disaster intrusions and <b>avoidance</b> <b>reactions</b> (OR: 2. 29;CI: 1. 04 – 5. 07) and hostility (OR: 3. 77;CI: 1. 51 – 9. 40) predicted MHS utilization following 18 months post-disaster. Conclusion This study showed that several demographic and disaster-related variables and self-reported and physician diagnosed health problems predicted post-disaster MHS-use.

This study examines predictors for mental health services (MHS) utilization among survivors of a man-made disaster in the Netherlands (May 2000). METHODS: Electronic records of survivors (n= 339; over 18 years and older) registered in a mental health service (MHS) were linked with general practice based electronic medical records (EMRs) of survivors and data obtained in surveys. EMR data were available from 16 months pre-disaster until 3 years post-disaster. Symptoms and diagnoses in the EMRs were coded according to the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC). Surveys were carried out 3 weeks and 18 months post-disaster, and included validated questionnaires on psychological distress, post-traumatic stress reactions and social functioning. Demographic and disaster-related variables were available. Predisposing factors for MHS utilization 0 - 18 months and 18 - 36 months post-disaster were examined using multiple logistic regression models. RESULTS: In multiple logistic models, adjusting for demographic and disaster related variables, MHS utilization was predicted by demographic variables (young age, immigrant, public health insurance, unemployment), disaster-related exposure (relocation and injuries), self-reported psychological problems and pre- and post-disaster physician diagnosed health problems (chronic diseases, musculoskeletal problems). After controlling for all health variables, disaster intrusions and <b>avoidance</b> <b>reactions</b> (OR: 2. 86; CI: 1. 48 - 5. 53), hostility (OR: 2. 04; CI: 1. 28 - 3. 25), pre-disaster chronic diseases (OR: 1. 82; CI: 1. 25 - 2. 65), injuries {{as a result of the}} disaster (OR: 1. 80;CI: 1. 13 - 2. 86), social functioning problems (OR: 1. 61;CI: 1. 05 - 2. 44) and younger age (OR: 0. 98;CI: 0. 96 - 0. 99) predicted MHS utilization within 18 months post-disaster. Furthermore, disaster intrusions and <b>avoidance</b> <b>reactions</b> (OR: 2. 29;CI: 1. 04 - 5. 07) and hostility (OR: 3. 77;CI: 1. 51 - 9. 40) predicted MHS utilization following 18 months post-disaster. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that several demographic and disaster-related variables and self-reported and physician diagnosed health problems predicted post-disaster MHS-use. The most important factors to predict post-disaster MHS utilization were disaster intrusions and <b>avoidance</b> <b>reactions</b> and symptoms of hostility (which can be identified as symptoms of PTSD) and pre-disaster chronic diseases...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationships}} between {{different types of}} workplace bullying and the reactions of victims were examined using six categories of bullying (threat to professional status, destabilization, isolation, overwork, verbal taunts, and violence) and three categories of <b>reactions</b> (assertiveness, <b>avoidance,</b> and seeking formal help). Participants were 127 employed undergraduates. Descriptive statistics and correlations were used to analyse the data. The findings revealed that <b>avoidance</b> <b>reactions</b> were the most common, followed by assertiveness and seeking formal help. As hypothesized, different types of bullying were associated with different types of reactions. Several practical implications derived from the findings were discussed suggesting that prevention is better than intervention...|$|R
