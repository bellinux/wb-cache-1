25|$|The 1976 {{model year}} saw no major {{changes to the}} Torino line-up. The Gran Torino Sport was discontinued, and so the Torino {{consisted}} of 9 separate models; 2- and 4-door versions of the Torino, Gran Torino, and Gran Torino Brougham, along with three station wagon models. New options for the 1976 model year included a power trunk release and an <b>automatic</b> <b>parking</b> brake release. Gran Torino 2-doors could now be ordered with the center console when optional bucket seats were specified; previously the console was only available on Sport models. In addition, opera windows and landau roofs were now available options for all 2-door models. There were no styling changes made to Torino for 1976.|$|E
500|$|As {{the first}} model {{developed}} by Lexus, the LS 400 debuted in January 1989 with the second generation debuting in November 1994. [...] The LS 430 debuted in January 2000 and the LS 460/LS 460 L series in 2006. A domestic-market version of the LS 400 and LS 430, badged as Toyota Celsior (Japanese: トヨタ・セルシオ, Toyota Serushio), was sold in Japan until the Lexus marque was introduced there in 2006. In 2006 (for the 2007 model year) the fourth-generation LS 460 debuted the first production eight-speed automatic transmission and an <b>automatic</b> <b>parking</b> system. In 2007, V8 hybrid powertrains were introduced on the LS 600h/LS 600h L sedans.|$|E

2500|$|Intelligent Parking Assist System (IPAS), {{also known}} as the Advanced Parking Guidance System (APGS) for Lexus models in the United States, is the first {{production}} <b>automatic</b> <b>parking</b> system developed by Toyota Motor Corporation in 1999 initially for the Japanese market hybrid Prius models and Lexus models. [...] The technology assists drivers in parking their vehicle. On vehicles equipped with the IPAS, via an in-dash screen and button controls, the car can steer itself into a parking space with little input from the user. [...] The first version of the system was deployed on the Prius Hybrid sold in Japan in 2003. [...] In 2006, an upgraded version debuted for the first time outside Japan on the Lexus LS luxury sedan, which featured the <b>automatic</b> <b>parking</b> technology among other brand new inventions from Toyota. In 2009, the system appeared on the third generation Prius sold in the U.S. In Asia and Europe, the parking technology is marketed as the Intelligent Park Assist System for both Lexus and Toyota models, while in the U.S. the Advanced Parking Guidance System name is only used for the Lexus system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Unmanned vehicle driving {{systems are}} getting {{interesting}} for the auto mobile industry. One {{of the key}} issues in the unmanned vehicle driving system is how to acquire the current position of the vehicle. In general, it {{can be achieved by}} Global Positioning System (GPS). However, if the unmanned vehicle will be parked in the parking garage by itself, GPS can not provide sufficient information to avoid collisions and the accuracy of GPS is not enough for the narrow <b>parking</b> space. An <b>automatic</b> vehicle <b>parking</b> system is proposed in the paper, where wireless sensor networks and infrared technologies are adopted simultaneously to enhance the accuracy of positioning. The prototype of the proposed <b>automatic</b> vehicle <b>parking</b> system is also implemented...|$|R

40|$|Design of an in-car user {{interface}} requires knowledge {{from the field}} of Human Factors as well as from usability theory. In this project, a {{user interface}} for an <b>automatic</b> parallel <b>parking</b> system has been developed. The main research question has been which display modality to choose, as current literature does not give a clear-cut answer to whether to use auditory or visual displays for in-car information systems. We also wanted to investigate how much information is needed in order to complete an <b>automatic</b> parallel <b>parking.</b> Results from three user evaluations with different prototypes indicate that audiovisual presentation is best suited for the task, and that feedback messages could be kept short. However, further research is needed since a real-life traffic situation differs from that in a sealed-off environment as the one used in this project. ...|$|R
