30|$|The {{results provide}} partial support for our {{hypothesis}} that increasing spreading activation in emotional memory networks {{would be associated}} with greater changes in heart rate and skin conductance due to the cumulative effect of an increasing number of somatic markers being activated. Both the number of emotional memory words and the <b>average</b> <b>ages</b> of the memories were significantly correlated with changes in heart rate and skin conductance. However, there were some differences between the happy and sad conditions as well as between the number of emotional memory words and the <b>average</b> <b>ages</b> of the memories. Specifically, there was a significant positive relationship between the number of happy word memories and heart rate but a significant negative relationship between the number of happy word memories and skin conductance. No significant relationships were found between the number of sad word memories and either heart rate or skin conductance. However, the <b>average</b> <b>ages</b> of the sad word memories was significantly positively correlated with skin conductance, but not with heart rate. Finally, the <b>average</b> <b>ages</b> of the happy word memories was not significantly correlated with either skin conductance or heart rate.|$|R

40|$|Short {{versions}} of four Eysenck personality scales had {{been included in}} questionnaires given to several adult samples from the Australian Twin Registry, comprising altogether some 5400 pairs. Means and regressions with age are compared for three samples at <b>average</b> <b>ages</b> of 23, 37, and 61 years, and for two samples of retested individuals, one tested twice at <b>average</b> <b>ages</b> of 29 and 37 years, and one tested three times at <b>average</b> <b>ages</b> of 45, 56, and 62 years, For {{both males and females}} the trends for Psychoticism (P), Extraversion (E), and Neuroticism (N) were generally downward with age, and for Lie (L), upward. However, in the longitudinal sample between ages 56 and 62 the trends for P, E, and I stopped or reversed, although N continued downward. Heritabilities were reasonably stable across age for P, E, and N, and the effects of shared environments negligible, but L showed some influence of shared environment as well as genes in all but the oldest age group.

40|$|This study {{tests the}} {{universality}} of the Western-based con-cept known as cognitive age within Japan. It assesses both {{the internal and external}} validity of cognitive age among Japanese seniors and compares the findings to the same measures of cognitive age with a sample of senior respon-dents from the United States. The study finds that the se-mantic differential scale has the largest trait variance among all <b>aging</b> concepts studied (<b>average</b> cognitive <b>age,</b> <b>average</b> ideal <b>age,</b> and <b>average</b> least-desired <b>age),</b> while the Likert scale possesses the largest trait variance for av-erage cognitive age. The ratio scale was found to have the lowest trait variance of the three scaling formats evalu-ated. External construct validation studies revealed a re-markable similarity between Japanese females and males, and contrasts between Japanese and American seniors re-vealed reasonably good generalizability between coun-tries. <b>Average</b> cognitive <b>age</b> appears to be universal within two culturally disjoint countries (the United States and Japan), yet the efficacy of individual measurement scales varies between them...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} cell age model forPenicillium chrysogenum fed-batch {{cultivation}} to supply a qualitative insight into morphology-associated dynamics. The <b>average</b> <b>ages</b> of the segregated cell populations, such as growing cells, non-growing cells and intact productive cells, were estimated by this model. A combined model {{was obtained by}} incorporating the <b>average</b> <b>ages</b> of the cell sub-populations into a known but modified segregated kinetic model from literature. For simulations, no additional effort was needed for parameter identification since the cell age model has no internal parameters. Validation of the combined model was performed by 20 charges of industrial-scale penicillin cultivation. Meanwhile, only two charge-dependent parameters were required in the combined model among approximately 20 parameters in total. The model is thus easily transformed into an adaptive model for a further application in on-line state variables prediction and optimal schedulin...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of base substitutions in humans increases with {{the age of}} the father, which shows up as an increased {{incidence of}} mutational disorders in the children of older fathers. There is a less obvious implication: an extended period of high <b>average</b> paternal <b>age</b> in a population will lead to increased genetic load. We mention some societies that have had high <b>average</b> paternal <b>age</b> for many generations. This may explain some surprising regional differences in recent measurements of deleterious mutations. High <b>average</b> paternal <b>age</b> also influences life history evolution, strengthening selection against mortality in late life while weakening selection against child mortality...|$|R
