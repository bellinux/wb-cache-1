5|$|Written by Chris Boucher, was {{submitted}} {{at some point}} after The Silent Scream had been rejected in early 1975. It {{was based on a}} premise that Hinchcliffe and Holmes wanted to use in which people and machines are controlled by <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>that</b> malfunctions. It was to be set on a space ship which has been home to several generations of a civilization.|$|E
5|$|On December 20, 2009, {{during a}} {{counseling}} session with two colleagues to discuss her poor time-keeping, Manning {{was told she}} would lose her one day off a week for persistent lateness. She responded by overturning a table, damaging <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>that</b> was sitting on it. A sergeant moved Manning away from the weapons rack, and other soldiers pinned her arms behind her back and dragged {{her out of the}} room. Several witnesses to the incident believed her access to sensitive material ought to have been withdrawn at that point. The following month, January 2010, she began posting on Facebook that she felt hopeless and alone.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} home to Singapore, Priya and Honey are fired by their boss (Archana Puran Singh) for taking a non-permitted extension of 5-days in their vacation. In order to keep their jobs, Honey suggests her boss making a television program about Krishna. Aware of Krishna's love towards her, Priya calls him to join her in Singapore to ask her mother permission to marry her. Krishna's grandmother objects to this, saying that {{people will want to}} take advantage of his abilities. She then explains that his father Rohit was hired by Dr. Siddhant Arya (Naseeruddin Shah) to design <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>that</b> could see the future in order to prevent wars and help prepare against natural disasters. However, Rohit later found out that the purpose of the computer was not for good purposes and he destroyed the machine. Rohit reportedly died in a laboratory accident that night, with Krishna's mother, Nisha dying of a broken heart shortly thereafter. Krishna promises his grandmother that he will never reveal his powers, so she permits him to go. In Singapore, during the program's production, Krishna keeps his word and reveals nothing exceptional about himself much to the disappointment of Honey and Priya, who get fired again.|$|E

5|$|The SSEM {{had been}} {{designed}} by the team of Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill. To develop the Mark 1 {{they were joined by}} two research students, D.B.G.Edwards and G. E. Thomas; work began in earnest in August 1948. The project soon had the dual purpose of supplying Ferranti with a working design on which they could base a commercial machine, the Ferranti Mark 1, and of building <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>that</b> would allow researchers to gain experience of how such a machine could be used in practice. The first of the two versions of the Manchester Mark 1– known as the Intermediary Version– was operational by April 1949. However, this first version lacked features such as the instructions necessary to programmatically transfer data between the main store and its newly developed magnetic backing store, which had to be done by halting the machine and manually initiating the transfer. These missing features were incorporated in the Final Specification version, which was fully working by October 1949. The machine contained 4,050 valves and had a power consumption of 25 kilowatts. To increase reliability, purpose-built CRTs made by GEC were used in the machine instead of the standard devices used in the SSEM.|$|E

25|$|According to MTV, {{this season}} of The Real World {{was the first}} to {{incorporate}} environmentally friendly household and lifestyle choices, including a solar-heated swimming pool that uses salt to reduce the need for chemical treatment, Energy Star appliances, bamboo flooring, recycled glass counters, some sustainable furniture, energy efficient lighting, a computer powered by an exercise bicycle, paperless toilets, a smart stove, an air conditioner system that provides water for an outdoor vegetable garden, <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>that</b> tracks the amount of carbon saved by the housemates, and a hybrid car.|$|E
25|$|The D1JP drift {{series has}} been {{prototyping}} and fine-tuning an electronic judging {{system based on}} custom sensors that record and transmit car data to <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>that</b> judges the run. This system is also being tested in some European series. It is designed to remove subjectivity and/or predisposition of judges. Usually the track for such a system is broken up into several sections (usually three) and the system automatically generates scores based on speed, angle and fluidity of the driver in each section, combining the scores for the final score. In certain situations judges can change or overrule a score, which happens, though rarely.|$|E
25|$|Mind {{uploading}} may {{potentially be}} accomplished by either of two methods: Copy-and-Transfer or gradual replacement of neurons. In {{the case of the}} former method, mind uploading would be achieved by scanning and mapping the salient features of a biological brain, and then by copying, transferring, and storing that information state into a computer system or another computational device. The simulated mind could be within a virtual reality or simulated world, supported by an anatomic 3D body simulation model. Alternatively, the simulated mind could reside in <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>that</b> is inside (or connected to) a (not necessarily humanoid) robot or a biological body in real life.|$|E

25|$|Searle's thought {{experiment}} {{begins with}} this hypothetical premise: suppose that artificial intelligence research {{has succeeded in}} constructing <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>that</b> behaves as if it understands Chinese. It takes Chinese characters as input and, by following the instructions of a computer program, produces other Chinese characters, which it presents as output. Suppose, says Searle, that this computer performs its task so convincingly that it comfortably passes the Turing test: it convinces a human Chinese speaker that the program is itself a live Chinese speaker. To all {{of the questions that}} the person asks, it makes appropriate responses, such that any Chinese speaker would be convinced that they are talking to another Chinese-speaking human being.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} finale was to {{take place}} on the hands of Big Ben with Ratigan eventually falling to his demise. However, layout artist Mike Peraza approached Musker with the idea of restaging the final confrontation so the characters would break through the face of the Big Ben with the grinding clockwork gears providing added menace, in which Musker agreed. Pereza and his team was sent to London for video reference and were granted unprecedented access to the clockworks inside Big Ben. Because the bells would chime at every quarter-hour, the team completed their research in one hour. Back at the Feature Animation building, animators Phil Nibbelink and Dave Gielow spent months designing the interior of Big Ben, with each gear produced as wire-frame graphics on <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>that</b> was printed out and traced onto animation cels onto which the colors and characters were added.|$|E

500|$|In 2011, the {{scientist}} Nicholas E.

This might be enough to save lives in the dazzle-patterned vehicle, and perhaps to cause the missile to miss entirely.|$|E
