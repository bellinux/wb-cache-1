2500|$|The 1967 Public Law 90-100 {{found the}} traffic in {{pornography}} to be [...] "a matter of national concern", {{as well as}} in obscenity. In this period the Court considered pornography to have two major dimensions. The first can be defined as dealing with sexual representations that are offensive to public morality or taste, which concerned the Court notably in the 1966 Ginzburg v. United States case. The second centers on the effect of pornography on specific individuals or classes, which is the focus of most public discussions and prior Court pornography decisions. This dimension was mentioned only twice in the array of decisions made in 1966. A frustration was expressed notably by Justice Hugo Black in the 1966 Mishkin v. New York: [...] "I wish once more to express my objections to saddling this Court with the irksome and inevitably unpopular and unwholesome task of finally deciding by a case-by-case, sight-by-sight personal judgment of the members of this Court what pornography (whatever that means) is too hard core for people to see or read." [...] In the 1974 Hamling v. United States decision the Supreme Court said that just because pornographic materials <b>are</b> <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> and purchased around the country, [...] "Mere availability of similar materials by itself means nothing more than that other persons are engaged in similar activities." [...] The 1976 American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language defined that pornography consists of [...] "written, graphic, or other forms of communication intended to excite lascivious feelings". Since determining what is pornography and what is [...] "soft core" [...] and [...] "hard core" [...] are subjective questions to judges, juries, and law enforcement officials, it is difficult to define, since the law cases cannot print examples for the courts to follow. The Rehnquist Court further enhanced the power of community controls on pornography. Current Chief Justice John Roberts told at the confirmation hearing on his nomination: [...] "Well, Senator, it's my understanding under the Supreme Court's doctrine that pornographic expression is not protected to the same extent at least as political and core speech, and the difficulty that the Court has addressed in these different areas of course is always defining what is or is not pornography and what is entitled to protection under the First Amendment and what is not".|$|E
