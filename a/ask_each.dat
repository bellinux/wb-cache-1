25|$|Dance floor {{etiquette}} {{varies in}} each scene, where, for example, one scene may encourage leads to ask follows to dance; another encourage advanced dancers to ask beginners; and, in a third, only friends <b>ask</b> <b>each</b> other to dance. In some scenes {{it is considered}} rude to leave a partner without having a second dance, while in many scenes there are unspoken conventions about teachers dancing with students, more experienced dancers dancing with beginners, and so on. There are no consistent rules between local scenes, though there are often national or international patterns.|$|E

25|$|Often, when {{counting}} objects, {{one does}} not {{keep track of what}} numerical label corresponds to which object: one only keeps track of the subgroup of objects which have already been labeled, so as to be able to identify unlabeled objects necessary for Step 2. However, if one is counting persons, then one can ask the persons who are being counted to each keep track of the number which the person's self has been assigned. After the count has finished it is possible to ask the group of persons to file up in a line, in order of increasing numerical label. What the persons would do during the process of lining up would be something like this: each pair of persons who are unsure of their positions in the line <b>ask</b> <b>each</b> other what their numbers are: the person whose number is smaller should stand on the left side and the one with the larger number {{on the right side of}} the other person. Thus, pairs of persons compare their numbers and their positions, and commute their positions as necessary, and through repetition of such conditional commutations they become ordered.|$|E

500|$|The Nannygate matter caused wealthy Americans to <b>ask</b> <b>each</b> other if {{they too}} had a [...] "Zoë Baird problem", as {{the hiring of}} illegal aliens and the paying of {{household}} help off the books were both commonplace. [...] Two fault lines, gender and class, were exposed in the discussion over Nannygate: in the former, a double standard was seen wherein female appointees faced {{a greater risk of}} being questioned and disqualified based upon their childcare arrangements, while in the latter, affluent professional women who could afford live-in childcare arrangements were seen as trying to get away with an illegal act. [...] Nannygate-type controversies have subsequently affected other political appointees both in the U.S. and in other countries.|$|E

500|$|The next day, Wendy and Max {{plan their}} lives together, asking Veronica {{to help them}} make Wendy [...] "disappear" [...] from her former life. A {{battered}} prostitute appears at Logan’s door and takes Wendy away, citing problems with their pimp, leaving Max heartbroken. Veronica finds a stain of purple makeup on a towel, and she immediately deduces that Wendy conned Max out of $1,000. Veronica blackmails a judge {{in order to secure}} the $1,000 back. Veronica and Logan <b>ask</b> <b>each</b> other personal questions in an attempt to become more intimate, but it fails. At the bus locker at which Veronica instructed the judge to leave the money, she instead finds a note that tells Veronica and Max to get in a limo. In the limo, they find Wendy’s pimp, who is actually a woman. She tells them that she actually did fall in love with Max, but that she needed money for other reasons.|$|E
500|$|The {{scale of}} horse theft by white thieves {{along the border}} {{increased}} dramatically during the late 1880s, which the police's sporadic deployments were unable to counter. In response, Commissioner Herchmer introduced a system of police patrols across the territories, with scheduled visits and inspections supported by surprise [...] "flying patrols". This approach was enabled by a network of new outposts across the major ranches. Police would visit almost every farm or ranch, seek {{to get to know}} every member of the community personally, gather intelligence and <b>ask</b> <b>each</b> settler to record any issues in a patrol book. Along the way, the police helped to distribute relief, including to the Métis communities affected by the rebellion, provided emergency medical assistance, and delivered mail to the more remote areas. Under the new patrol system, the mounted police travelled a total of [...] on average each year on horseback. Backed by harsh sentences from the courts, the process virtually eliminated rural crime.|$|E

[...] George Steinbrenner has stated that when Martin was in his best form, he was a [...] "baseball genius." [...] He has also been cited as an influence to other prominent managers, including Lou Piniella. Martin both preceded and succeeded Piniella as Yankees manager.|$|E

In addition, AIPAC helps connect donors with candidates, especially to the network of pro-Israel political action committees. AIPAC president Howard Friedman says “AIPAC meets with every candidate running for Congress. These candidates receive in-depth briefings to help them completely understand the complexities of Israel’s predicament {{and that of the}} Middle East as a whole. We even <b>ask</b> <b>each</b> candidate to author a ‘position paper’ on their views of the US-Israel relationship – so it’s clear where they stand on the subject.” ...|$|E
2500|$|What Is Your Dangerous Idea?: Today's Leading Thinkers on the Unthinkable {{is a book}} {{edited by}} John Brockman, which deals with [...] "dangerous" [...] ideas, or ideas that some people would react to in ways that suggest a {{disruption}} of morality and ethics. Scientists, philosophers, artists, and various other groups of people have written in to the online salon called the Edge, where thinkers in several areas post and discuss their ideas. [...] This collection of responses forms {{the entirety of the}} book (possibly with some excluded because of the great number of posts).

2500|$|The {{prospective}} partners either date {{each other}} or in stricter communities {{they go to a}} [...] "bashow" [...] or sit in. A typical bashow scene is that the young man with his parents goes to see the young woman in her house to see if the prospective couple are compatible. Both sets of parents talk to each other, and then when the setting is more relaxed, they go into another room, leaving the man and woman in the living room to speak among themselves. Some use this opportunity to actually <b>ask</b> <b>each</b> other pertinent questions, while some just want to see if they like each other, relying more on the information they got from the shadchen or from other people. The number of bashows prior to announcing an engagement varies, as some have many bashows while others have as few as one, which is typical among the children of Hasidic Rebbes.|$|E
2500|$|Selection of jurors from a jury pool {{occurs when}} a trial is {{announced}} and juror names are randomly selected and called out by the jury pool clerk. [...] Depending {{on the type of}} trial—whether a 6-person or 12 person jury is needed, in the United States—anywhere from 15 to 30 prospective jurors are sent to the courtroom to participate in voir dire, pronounced [...] in French, and defined as the oath to speak the truth in the examination testing competence of a juror, or in another application, a witness. Once the list of prospective jurors has assembled in the courtroom the court clerk assigns them seats in the order their names were originally drawn. [...] At this point the judge often will <b>ask</b> <b>each</b> prospective juror to answer a list of general questions such as name, occupation, education, family relationships, time conflicts for the anticipated length of the trial. [...] The list is usually written up and clearly visible to assist nervous prospective jurors and may include several questions uniquely pertinent to the particular trial. [...] These questions are to familiarize the judge and attorneys with the jurors and glean biases, experiences, or relationships that could jeopardize the proper course of the trial.|$|E
