5|$|Ryouta, {{searching for}} a way into the medical center basement, seeks out Nageki in the library to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> his death. Upon {{discovering}} documents revealing that Operation Hatoful was a Hawk Party project into developing biological weapons for use against humans using the school as an experimental facility—with a focus on a strain of H5N1 almost immediately lethal to humans dubbed the Charon virus—Nageki recalls that the fire was caused by his committing suicide by self-immolation after months of forced experimentation in order to destroy and remove any trace of the virus, which was isolated in his body, and that researchers often went in through the chemistry preparation room. Ryouta, Kazuaki, and Anghel {{make their way into}} the medical center's basement through the chemistry lab and encounter Labor 9, electrocuting it using a stun gun given to Ryouta earlier by Mister One. They confront Shuu, who imprisons Kazuaki and Anghel, leaving them to die of poison gas before leading Ryouta away. Meanwhile, San comforts Sakuya, {{and the two of them}} arrive to break Anghel and Kazuaki out of the prison.|$|E
5|$|The {{police are}} upset about Abbott’s death and blame Scully while Doggett reminds them {{that only the}} thing that killed Abbott and the others is to blame. Scully {{explains}} Ariel McKesson died of heart failure and then was burned to cover something up. She realizes that all the victims were people who {{came in contact with}} the body of Ariel McKesson: Abbott investigated the crime, her mother identified the body, the undertaker prepared the body, and Myron Stefaniuk pulled the body from the river. All but Myron Stefaniuk are now dead. Doggett and Scully find Myron and <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Ernie Stefaniuk, one of the hunters from 1956, who he reveals disappeared a long time ago. The two eventually track down Ernie Stefaniuk, who tells them that he hid on an island {{in the middle of the}} town's lake with his wife, Ariel, for 44 years. Ernie says that the bat creature kills anyone with Ernie’s scent on them, so he had burned his wife’s body to try and cover up the scent. He informs them that it hunts only at night and Myron is in danger. Doggett goes back to find Myron only to be attacked and badly torn up by the creature at the river.|$|E
5|$|In May 1851 Metternich {{left for}} his Johannisberg estate, {{which he had}} last visited in 1845. That summer Metternich enjoyed the company of Prussian {{representative}} Otto von Bismarck. He also enjoyed a visit from Frederick William, though the King irritated Metternich by appearing to cultivate him as a tool against Schwarzenberg. In September Metternich returned to Vienna, entertained along the way by various German princes keen to entertain the focus of Prussian intrigue. Metternich was reinvigorated, dropped his nostalgia, and lived in the present {{for the first time}} in a decade. Franz Josef asked for his advice on numerous issues (though he was too headstrong to be much influenced by it), and both of the two emerging factions in Vienna courted Metternich; even Tsar Nicholas called on him during a state visit. Metternich was not keen on the new Foreign Minister, Karl Ferdinand von Buol but thought him sufficiently incompetent that he would be impressionable. Metternich's advice was of varying quality; nonetheless, some of it was usefully insightful, even in modern issues. Now deaf, Metternich wrote endlessly, particularly for an appreciative Franz Josef. He wanted Austrian neutrality in the Crimean War, though Buol did not. In the meantime Metternich's health was slowly failing, and he was a more peripheral figure after the death of his wife Melanie in January 1854. In a brief resurgence of energy in early 1856, he busied himself in arrangements for a marriage between his son Richard and his granddaughter Pauline (Richard's step-sister's daughter) and undertook more travel. The King of the Belgians came to visit, as did Bismarck, and on 16 August 1857 he entertained the future Edward VII of the United Kingdom. Buol, however, was growing more resentful of Metternich's advice, particularly about Italy. In April 1859 Franz Josef came to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> what should be done in Italy. According to Pauline, Metternich begged him not to send an ultimatum to Italy, and Franz Josef explained that such an ultimatum had already been sent.|$|E

After two hours of asking him questions through his lawyer, James Dempsey, Mrs. Gaffney gave up. She was still unconvinced that Albert Fish was her son's killer.|$|E

As her execution fire is lit, the knight gives her herbs to take away her pain. Jöns and Block watch, grimly, as her sentence is carried out.|$|E
25|$|Adamson v. California, – Adamson {{was charged}} with murder but chose not to testify because he knew the {{prosecutor}} would <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> his prior criminal record. Adamson argued that because the prosecutor had drawn attention to his refusal to testify, and thus Adamson's freedom against self-incrimination had been violated. Reed wrote that the rights guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment did not extend the protections of the Fifth Amendment to state courts. Reed felt that {{the framers of the}} Fourteenth Amendment did not intend to apply the Bill of Rights to states without limitation.|$|E

25|$|On 22 May 2003, at the Charing Cross Hotel in London, Kelly met Andrew Gilligan, a BBC {{journalist}} {{who had spent}} some time writing {{about the war in}} Baghdad. Kelly was anxious to learn what had happened in Iraq, while Gilligan, who had discussed a very early draft of the dossier with Kelly, wished to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> it in light of the failure to find any weapons of mass destruction. They agreed to talk on an unattributable basis, which allowed the BBC to report what was said but not to identify the source. Kelly told Gilligan of his concerns over the 45-minute claim and allegedly ascribed its inclusion in the dossier to Alastair Campbell, the director of communications for Tony Blair.|$|E
500|$|Agent Phil Coulson visits Elias Morrow {{in prison}} to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> {{his work at}} Momentum Energy labs; Morrow's {{co-workers}} there {{appear to have been}} killed in an explosion and returned as ghosts. Coulson promises to get Morrow released if he cooperates, but Morrow refuses. Outside the prison, Morrow's nephew Robbie Reyes arrives to also ask his uncle about Momentum, but agent Alphonso [...] "Mack" [...] MacKenzie recognizes Reyes as the vigilante Ghost Rider, and he and Coulson chase Reyes in Coulson's car. The chase ends when Reyes drives into S.H.I.E.L.D.'s invisible quinjet, and the agents take Reyes into custody. Coulson convinces Reyes to help their investigation into Momentum by speaking to Morrow on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s behalf, and he learns that Momentum's misfortunes came about from studying a mysterious book, the Darkhold.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, Mulder and Scully {{visit the}} care home where Roland lives. When they gently <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> {{the night of}} the murder, he tells them he had not seen {{anything}} out of the ordinary. He also inadvertently reveals his mathematical prowess by rapidly counting the star designs visible on Scully's blouse; however, his handwriting does not match the fourth sample taken from the whiteboard. The discussion ends when Roland experiences a violent vision and has {{what seems to be a}} fit. Later that night, Roland has another vision in which he sees someone killing Keats. He appears at the lab and murders Keats by submerging his head in a tank of liquid nitrogen. Keats' frozen body is left to shatter as Roland begins typing at one of the computers.|$|E

500|$|As {{shown in}} [...] "The Impossible Astronaut", the Doctor joins his friends at Lake Silencio and then {{approaches}} the astronaut, now {{known to be}} a younger version of River Song, Amy and Rory's daughter, trained to kill the Doctor by the Silence and Madame Kovarian. River does not want to kill him but is unable to fight the suit's control, and the Doctor says he forgives her and reminds her that the event is inevitable. River, despite his warning against interfering with a fixed point, surprises the Doctor by draining the astronaut suit's weapons systems and averting his death. Time becomes [...] "stuck" [...] as a result and begins to disintegrate; all of Earth's history begins to run simultaneously at a fixed moment of 5:02p.m. on 22 April 2011. In London, Holy Roman Emperor Winston Churchill takes the Doctor, his [...] "soothsayer", out from his locked cell to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the condition of time. The Doctor explains the preceding events, as tally marks begin appearing on his arms, indicating the presence of the Silence. After noticing a Silence nest overhead, they are rescued by Amy and a squad of soldiers under her command. Due to the effects of the crack in her bedroom, Amy is cognizant of the altered timeline, though she is unaware that her trusted captain is her husband Rory. Amy takes the Doctor to [...] "Area 52", a hollowed-out Giza pyramid, where they have captured over a hundred Silence and Madame Kovarian. River is also there; aware of the consequences of her actions, she refuses to allow the Doctor to touch her, an event that would [...] "unfreeze" [...] time and allow it to resume. They all wear [...] "eyedrives", external memory eye patches which enable them to avoid the Silence's effect of erasing themselves from memory.|$|E
500|$|Former UCLA {{professor}} of information studies Philip E. Agre and journalist Eric Boehlert argued that three articles in Wired News {{led to the}} creation of the widely spread urban legend that Gore claimed to have [...] "invented the Internet", which followed this interview. In addition, computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued in his defense. Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn stated that [...] "we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet." [...] Cerf would later state: [...] "Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues. His initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet. So he really does deserve credit." [...] In a speech to the American Political Science Association, former Republican Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich also stated: [...] "In all fairness, it's something Gore had worked on a long time. Gore is not the Father of the Internet, but in all fairness, Gore is the person who, in the Congress, most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an Internet, and the truth is—and I worked with him starting in 1978 when I got , we were both part of a [...] "futures group"—the fact is, in the Clinton administration, the world we had talked about in the '80s began to actually happen." [...] Finally, Wolf Blitzer (who conducted the original 1999 interview) stated in 2008 that: [...] "I didn't <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the Internet. I asked him about the differences he had with Bill Bradley [...] Honestly, at the time, when he said it, it didn't dawn on me that this was going to have the impact that it wound up having, because it was distorted to a certain degree and people said they took what he said, which was a carefully phrased comment about taking the initiative and creating the Internet to—I invented the Internet. And that was the sort of shorthand, the way his enemies projected it and it wound up being a devastating setback to him and it hurt him, as I'm sure he acknowledges to this very day." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{regards to}} the same passage, Suzanne Fields goes on to note [...] "When asked if the stories were true, Mr. Cockburn delicately demurs. 'I don't think I said they were true,' he told The New Republic. 'I don't know there's enough {{exterior}} evidence {{to determine whether they}} are true or not.'" [...] Another of his critics was Franklin Foer of The New Republic, who first noted Cockburn's response: To be fair, Cockburn doesn't exactly endorse these theories. Rather, by noting that all of these Jewish conspiracy stories are [...] "sloshing around the news," [...] Cockburn seems merely to be pointing out that, hey, anti-Semitic ideas are still out there today — so why the shock that [...] endorsed them 30 years ago? Indeed, when I reached Cockburn to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> these conspiracies, he insisted he was just reporting what was already in circulation.|$|E

This was the reason we carried on as SABBAT and did a third album. Obviously we wanted the new line up to work out but it didn't … simple as that. What it came down to though was Simon Negus and myself, in theory, own the business and name as they left.

2500|$|In July 2009, Coppola was put {{on trial}} for murder, {{racketeering}} and extorting the Local 1235 of the International Longshoremen's Association for over 30 years. If found guilty of all counts, he could have faced life imprisonment. Defense lawyer Henry Mazurek told jurors that Coppola admitted to making a [...] "rash" [...] decision to flee, but that it didn't prove he's a killer. [...] "He didn't want to stand trial for a murder he didn't commit," [...] Mazurek said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jack Dennehy told the jury not to be fooled by Coppola's claims and that Coppola [...] "ran because he didn't want to face a jury like you. He hid because he didn't want to face a jury like you." [...] Thomas Riccardi testified that Coppola {{said he did not}} agree with the Lardiere murder, but that he followed the orders given to him by Tino Fiumara (who was never charged). Genovese family member turned government witness George Barone was also called to aid the prosecution. Barone was such a difficult witness that the prosecutor apparently decided not to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the Lardiere murder.|$|E
2500|$|Rav Judah {{taught in}} the name of Rav that as Moses was dying, Joshua quoted back to Moses the report of [...] about how Joshua stood by the side of Moses all the time. Rav Judah {{reported}} {{in the name of}} Rav that when Moses was dying, he invited Joshua to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> any doubts that Joshua might have. Joshua replied by asking Moses whether Joshua had ever left Moses for an hour and gone elsewhere. Joshua asked Moses whether Moses had not written in [...] "The Lord would speak to Moses face to face, as one man speaks to another[...] [...] [...] But his servant Joshua the son of Nun departed not out of the Tabernacle." [...] Joshua's words wounded Moses, and immediately the strength of Moses waned, and Joshua forgot 300 laws, and 700 doubts concerning laws arose in Joshua's mind. The Israelites then arose to kill Joshua (unless he could resolve these doubts). God then told Joshua that {{it was not possible to}} tell him the answers (for, as [...] tells, the Torah is not in Heaven). Instead, God then directed Joshua to occupy the Israelites' attention in war, as [...] reports.|$|E
2500|$|After {{developing}} [...] "a random obsession" [...] with Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny, {{she took}} the morning off school during her Junior Certificate mock examinations and met the future Taoiseach as he campaigned in Millstreet ahead of the 2011 general election. Their meeting was filmed for television, with Kenny vowing he would not reduce disability funding if elected. O'Riordan later remarked, [...] "I thought he was honest. He looked like someone who wasn't {{going to tell a}} lie." [...] Upon election he cut disability funding and O'Riordan wrote a letter expressing her disappointment. Her public confrontation with Enda Kenny over his spending cuts to disability funding contributed to O'Riordan's rise to fame; the government later changed its mind. She later explained: [...] "I thought Enda Kenny was a cool guy, you know, he always seemed really relaxed, and easy going. So I only went up for a picture and one of our local people from home was like ‘why don't you <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> people with disabilities’, so I did and the local television were recording because it was a big thing for Millstreet, our Future Taoiseach coming.
