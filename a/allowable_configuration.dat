Army Aeroflightdynamics Directorate (AFDD) showed a significant influence of the dynamic characteristics of active sidesticks on handling qualities of fly-by-wire helicopters and indicated a trend of optimal natural frequency and damping values leading to a first order response model. However this trend could not be validated due to restrictions of the used hardware. An upgrade of the firmware by the manufacturer to expand the <b>allowable</b> <b>configuration</b> envelope now enabled to configure the dynamic characteristics in a significantly enlarged parameter space, so that the response {{can be considered as}} a first order system with a time delay. A first flight test campaign at Braunschweig airport with the upgraded stick and with an Attitude Command configuration confirmed the trend to higher frequency and damping values. This paper presents the previous experiments, which were performed with active sidestick (DLR, ACT/FHS) and centerstick (AFDD/RASCAL) inceptors for Rate and Attitude Command response types, the results of a simulator study for RC and AC response types, and the results of the recently conducted campaign at DLR. In all experiments regression analyses were performed based on pilot ratings.

40|$|A popular {{technique}} for studying random properties of a combinatorial set is {{to design a}} Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. For many problems there are natural Markov chains connecting the set of <b>allowable</b> <b>configurations</b> {{which are based on}} local moves, or "Glauber dynamics. " Typically these single site update algorithms are difficult to analyze, so often the Markov chain is modified to update several sites simultaneously. Recently there has been progress in analyzing these more complicated algorithms for several important combinatorial problems. In this work we use the comparison technique of Diaconis and Saloff-Coste to show that several of the natural single point update algorithms are efficient. The strategy is to relate the mixing rate of these algorithms to the corresponding non-local algorithms which have already been analyzed. This allows us to give polynomial bounds for single point update algorithms for problems such as generating planar tilings and random triangulations of c [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{multiple}} level {{pattern matching}} approach to text image parsing is described. The parser assigns syntactic categories to words {{that occur in}} a two-dimensional image of a constrained block of text. Bottom-up information (from an image segmentation routine), that includes the number of lines of text, {{the number of words}} in each line, and an estimate of the number of characters in each word, is initially used to compute a ranked list of categories for each word and a probability that each one is correct. The local support provided by words that are horizontally adjacent is used to refine the initial assignment and to assign a ranked list of categories to each line. The word and line category assignments are then probabilistically fit to patterns that describe <b>allowable</b> <b>configurations</b> of lines. The output is a ranked list of the patterns that fit best and the probabilities that they are correct. A success rate of up to 96 percent is achieved in classifying lines of text in a test sel of postal address images. AI topic: Knowledge-based control, parsing. Domain area: Process automation...|$|R
40|$|Part IV is a {{continuation}} of Part II. It is generally not necessary to read Part III before starting Part IV. In the models and methods studied in Part II, it was assumed that a path can be easily determined between any two configurations in the absence of obstacles. For example, the sampling-based roadmap approach assumed that two nearby configurations could be connected by a “straight line” in the configuration space. The constraints on the path are global {{in the sense that the}} restrictions are on the set of <b>allowable</b> <b>configurations.</b> The next few chapters introduce differential constraints, which restrict the allowable velocities at each point. These can be considered as local constraints, in contrast to the global constraints that arise due to obstacles. Some weak differential constraints, such as smoothness requirements, arose in Chapter 8. Part IV goes much further by covering differential consraints in full detail and generality. Differential constraints arise everywhere. In robotics, most problems involve differential constraints that arise from the kinematics and dynamics of a robot. ...|$|R

40|$|Particle {{filtering}} is {{a popular}} method used in systems for tracking human body pose in video. One key difficulty in using particle filtering {{is caused by the}} curse of dimensionality: generally {{a very large number of}} particles is required to adequately approximate the underlying pose distribution in a high-dimensional state space. Although the number of degrees of freedom in the human body is quite large, in reality, the subset of <b>allowable</b> <b>configurations</b> in state space is generally restricted by human biomechanics, and the trajectories in this allowable subspace tend to be smooth. Therefore, a framework is proposed to learn a low-dimensional representation of the high-dimensional human poses state space. This mapping can be learned using a Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GPLVM) framework. One important advantage of the GPLVM framework is that both the mapping to, and mapping from the embedded space are smooth; this facilitates sampling in the low-dimensional space, and samples generated in the low-dimensional embedded space are easily mapped back into the original highdimensional space. Moreover, human body poses that are similar in the original space tend to be mapped close to each other in the embedded space; this property can be exploited when sampling in the embedded space. The proposed framework is tested in tracking 2 D human body pose using a Scaled Prismatic Model. Experiments on real life video sequences demonstrate the strength of the approach. In comparison with the Multiple Hypothesis Tracking and the standard Condensation algorithm, the proposed algorithm is able to maintain tracking reliably throughout the long test sequences. It also handles singularity and self occlusion robustly. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We propose an {{approximate}} description of basic parameters (radius, mass and oblateness) of general relativistic compact rotating objects {{in terms of}} the parameters of the static configuration and of the angular velocity only. The representation in terms of static properties is derived using the condition of stationary equilibrium together with some phenomenological assumptions. The predicted radius and mass of rotating neutron star (described by some realistic equations of state) and strange star (described by the bag model equation of state) are compared with data obtained by numerical integration of gravitational field equation. The obtained formulae also allow a simple derivation of the ”empirical ” equation relating the maximum rotation frequency Ωmax of uniformly rotating star models to the mass and radius of the maximum <b>allowable</b> mass <b>configuration</b> of the non-rotating model.

40|$|Using {{the general}} {{relativistic}} conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium and fitting with values obtained from numerical integration of structure equations we derive approximate mass and radius formulas for static and uniformly rotating strange stars obeying the bag model equation of state. In the static case our formulas can reproduce {{the values of}} the mass and radius of the quark star with an error smaller than 1 %. The maximum mass and radius of the strange stars can be predicted by fitting only one set of static configuration data. With the use of results obtained for the static configuration and with some supplementary assumptions about the behavior of the metric tensor {{at the center of the}} star, we can predict the rotational properties of maximally rotating strange stars within an error of 3 %. From the approximate formulas we can derive the "empirical" formula relating the maximum rotation frequency of the uniformly rotating strange stars to the mass and radius of the maximum <b>allowable</b> static <b>configuration.</b> © 2000 The American Physical Society. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a CAD-based approach to some management tasks {{related to the}} manufacture of stamping tools for car body parts. The proposed method generates assembly plans for draw dies and trim/pierce dies from their design information. Die assembly is a highly constrained process including a variety of part handling, measurement and surface finishing operations. As such, it escapes some critical assumptions underlying most generative planning methodologies in literature. Such complexity is faced through a comprehensive description model of the assembly process, which represents the space of all feasible operation sequences for any <b>allowable</b> die <b>configuration</b> within a predefined domain. Once a specific configuration has been retrieved from solid and surface CAD descriptions of die parts, the assembly model is instantiated into a graph-like data structure, which include only applicable operations and their precedence constraints. An instance describes operations at a sufficient detail level to support time estimation, process documentation and production scheduling. A prototype software tool derived from the assembly planning method has been tested in a real industrial context, in order to evaluate its potential impact on the efficiency of die manufacture. r 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A {{prevalent}} {{trend in}} modeling human sentence processing {{has been to}} account for both initial attachment preferences and reanalysis behaviors with minimal extensions to a presumed set of initial parsing operations. Here, an entirely different formulation of the initial attachment and revision processes is suggested. Rather than assuming that all parsing is (as much as possible) initial attachment, the opposite approach is advocated: that all parsing [...] -even initial attachment [...] -is restructuring. The realization of parsing as restructuring arises from a set of independently motivated computational assumptions within the competitive attachment architecture, a hybrid connectionist model of the human sentence processor. Central to the model is a unique parallel attachment operation that simultaneously attaches the current input phrase, while reattaching previously structured phrases. Within this model, reanalysis is not a separate process or module, but rather {{a side effect of}} the primary means of forming syntactic structures. The ease of performing possible reanalyses is therefore determined by the same conditions, such as recency and lexical preferences, that affect initial attachments. Furthermore, independently motivated constraints on the network structure determine the <b>allowable</b> syntactic <b>configurations</b> that may undergo restructuring within the competitive attachment operation. The model thus also provides a computational explanation of gardenpath sentences, in which automatic reanalysis is impossible...|$|R

In this paper, {{we propose}} two discrete-time dynamical systems that explain how an appraisal network evolves towards social balance from an initially unbalanced configuration. These two models {{are based on}} two different socio-psychological mechanisms respectively: the homophily mechanism and the influence mechanism. Our main theoretical contribution is a comprehensive analysis for both models in three steps. First, we establish the well-posedness and bounded evolution of the interpersonal appraisals. Second, we characterize the set of equilibrium points as follows: for both models, each equilibrium network is composed by an arbitrary number of complete subgraphs satisfying structural balance. Third, under a technical condition, we establish convergence of the appraisal network to a final equilibrium network satisfying structural balance. In addition to our theoretical analysis, we provide numerical evidence that our technical condition for convergence holds for generic initial conditions in both models. Finally, adopting the homophily-based model, we present numerical results on the mediation and globalization of local conflicts, the competition for allies, and the asymptotic formation of a single versus two factions...|$|R
