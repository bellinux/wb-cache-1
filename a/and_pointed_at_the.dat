5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} {{is large and}} triangular, with a pointed apex and a concave {{trailing}} margin; it originates roughly over the posterior insertions of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin {{is less than a}} third as high as the first, and originates ahead of the anal fin. There is no midline ridge between the dorsal fins. The long pectoral fins are broad and slightly falcate (sickle-shaped), becoming narrow <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tips. The anal fin has a sharply notched trailing margin. The caudal peduncle has a deep notch on its upper surface at the caudal fin origin. The caudal fin is asymmetrical, with a well-developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a notch in the trailing margin near its tip.|$|E
25|$|Several {{fragments}} {{show that}} the horns are slightly curved and bending forward, of uncertain length <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end (different from the warriors); furthermore there are traces of a support, obtained from the same stone, joining the horns approximately at their half-length.|$|E
25|$|The Cypriot {{battalion}} {{brought with}} them their own distinctive war banner, consisting of a white flag with a large blue cross, and the words GREEK FLAG OF THE MOTHERLAND CYPRUS emblazoned in the top left corner. The flag was hoisted on a wooden mast, carved <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end {{to act as a}} lance in battle. The legendary battle flag is currently stored at the National Historical Museum of Athens.|$|E

25|$|Although when {{designing}} it {{they have}} {{paid attention to}} detail the people of Newcastle paid {{for it to be}} built, not the Council of the time. The theme of the building is set by lancet windows; slim <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top as in the Gothic style, they are complemented by arched borders that protrude from the brickwork. Decorative gables and bargeboards fringe the pitched slate roof on all sides of the building. A tall spire, two chimneys and numerous decorative finials once lined the top of the roof but have been damaged or lost over the years and {{were not included in the}} restorations. The rooms are large with high pitched ceilings that show solid timber rafters.|$|E
25|$|The general colour of the upperparts is pearl grey, tinged {{brownish}} {{towards the}} east of its Eurasian range. The cheeks and chin {{as well as a}} thin and often hard-to-see stripe above the eye are white, and a deep black mask extends from the beak through the eye to the ear coverts; the area immediately above the beak is grey. The scapulars (shoulder feathers) are white, and the wings are black with a white bar made up by the bases of the primary remiges, continuing slightly offset onto the bases of the secondary remiges in some regions. The tail is black, long, <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tip; the outer rectrices have white outer vanes. The underparts are white, slightly tinged with grey in most subspecies. In particular the breast is usually darker and sometimes browner {{than the rest of the}} light underside, and may appear as an indistinct band between the lighter belly and white throat. In the subspecies around the North Pacific in particular and in females elsewhere too, there may be faint brownish bars on the breast. The bill is large and hooked at the tip and coloured nearly black, but pale at the base of the under mandible (though the extent varies seasonally). The legs and feet are blackish.|$|E
500|$|A Tesla Roadster {{was used}} to record the game's tire sounds. The {{developers}} chose the Tesla due to its near-silent electric motor which allowed them to record the sounds cleanly without engine or exhaust noise. Two microphones were mounted to the car <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tire for recording. Lance Hayes, the award-winning composer for Forza Motorsport 3, returned to score Forza Motorsport 4, which features a combination of his music and other licensed artists. 15 songs were provided by Hayes for the user interface and some in-race music. In speaking of {{the tone of the}} soundtrack, Hayes stated [...] "The score has an increased cinematic feel as well as incorporating many of the styles (downtempo, electronic, ambient) that made the Forza Motorsport 3 OST a fan favorite." ...|$|E

500|$|Small {{birds are}} killed on impact or when {{squeezed}} by the Eurasian sparrowhawk's foot, especially the two long claws. Victims which struggle are [...] "kneaded" [...] by the hawk, using its talons to squeeze and stab. When dealing with large prey species which peck and flap, the hawk's long legs help. It stands {{on top of}} its prey to pluck and pull it apart. The feathers are plucked and usually the breast muscles are eaten first. The bones are left, but can be broken using the notch in the bill. Like other birds of prey, Eurasian sparrowhawks produce pellets containing indigestible parts of their prey. These range from [...] long and [...] wide and are round {{at one end and}} more narrow <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> other. They are usually composed of small feathers, as the larger ones are plucked and not consumed.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of the thirteenth season of The Simpsons on DVD and Blu-ray, [...] "The Blunder Years" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. Giving the episode a positive review, Dominic von Riedermann of suite101 stated that the episode was one of the season's [...] "comedy gems", praising Paul Newman's guest appearance in particular. Writing for DVD Verdict, Jennifer Malkowski gave a favorable review of the episode, giving a B rating <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> scene in which [...] "Homer says finding a corpse explains everything that's gone wrong in his life—especially his fear of corpses" [...] as the highlight of the episode. Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide was positive, calling the episode a [...] "reasonably amusing spoof [...] ". He enjoyed [...] "Marge's lust for Burly" [...] and [...] "Homer's rampaging fear", and concluded by saying that, while nothing in the episode [...] "dazzles", it still [...] "adds up to a good episode".|$|E
2500|$|To test how the {{scattering}} varied with {{the angle of}} deflection (i.e. if s ∝ csc4Φ/2) Geiger and Marsden built an apparatus that consisted of a hollow metal cylinder mounted on a turntable. [...] Inside the cylinder was a metal foil (F) and a radiation source containing radon (R), mounted on a detached column (T) which allowed the cylinder to rotate independently. [...] The column was also a tube by which air was pumped out of the cylinder. [...] A microscope (M) with its objective lens covered by a fluorescent zinc sulfide screen (S) penetrated {{the wall of the}} cylinder <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> metal foil. By turning the table, the microscope could be moved a full circle around the foil, allowing Geiger to observe and count alpha particles deflected by up to 150°. Correcting for experimental error, Geiger and Marsden found that the number of alpha particles that are deflected by a given angle Φ is indeed proportional to csc4Φ/2.|$|E

2500|$|The Creatures' {{most famous}} and long-standing chant {{is known as the}} roll call. In the top of the first inning, when the Yankees are on the field and their {{starting}} pitcher is getting ready to throw the first pitch, everyone in the section stands and begins clapping. After the pitch is thrown, Creature [...] "Bald" [...] Vinny Milano gestures for the crowd to calm down, then cups his hands around his mouth and shouts out the name of the center fielder (e.g.: [...] "Yo, Aaron!", for Aaron Hicks). The whole group proceeds to chant the name until there is a response, usually {{in the form of a}} wave or a point; some Yankees respond with extra enthusiasm, such as Johnny Damon (who typically dropped to one knee <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Creatures with both hands) and Nick Swisher (who came to attention, faced the Creatures, and saluted). The Creatures move through the lineup, going from the center fielder to the left fielder, right fielder, first baseman, second baseman, shortstop and third baseman, in that order. (With the exception of a few rare instances, the pitcher and the catcher are not a part of the roll call.) Anti-obscenity laws were exercised in 2007, but are not always strictly enforced; if they are able, the Creatures will turn to the right field box seats at the completion of the Roll Call and chant [...] "Box seats suck!" [...] During the days of the bleachers' no-alcohol-sales policy, fans in the right-field box seats occasionally replied with a chant of [...] "We've got beer!" [...] If the Yankees are playing the Red Sox, the intensity of the Yankees – Red Sox rivalry takes hold; the Creatures then cut the 'box seats' chant short and instead chant [...] "Boston sucks!" [...] until that dissipates. If police cut this short, the Creatures resort to chanting [...] "No fun allowed!", or nothing at all. If a non-pitcher is replaced in a defensive position, the replacement is given the same chant. Sometimes, after a long rain delay, the Creatures will start another Roll Call just for fun. Also, until the Red Sox won the World Series in , the Creatures would chant [...] "1918!" [...] and hold up signs saying [...] "CURSE OF THE BAMBINO!" [...] and pictures of Babe Ruth to remind the Red Sox of the last time they won a championship.|$|E
