5|$|Seneb's {{dwarfism}} {{is depicted}} realistically in the sculpture. It portrays {{him with a}} large head but small arms and legs. This possibly indicates that he had <b>achondroplasia,</b> a common form of dwarfism that most severely affects the fastest-growing {{parts of the body}} – particularly the femur and humerus, which become short and squat – and stunts the forearms and lower legs. It also affects the head, producing a relatively large skull with a bulging forehead and often a depressed nasal bridge. An alternative diagnosis is dysmelia – a condition that produces short arms and legs. Seneb's wife Senites is portrayed far less realistically; her depiction is of a piece with other contemporary portraits of high-ranking Egyptian women.|$|E
5|$|Seneb is {{depicted}} {{with his wife}} and children in a painted sculpture from his tomb, rediscovered in 1926, that is a famous example of Old Kingdom art. It shows him sitting cross-legged on a block of stone with his wife embracing him and his children standing below him where the legs of a full-size person would ordinarily have been. The composition of the scene thus achieves a harmonious symmetry. It depicts Seneb realistically with the facial features and shortened limbs of an individual with <b>achondroplasia,</b> a common form of dwarfism. Paintings and carvings in the tomb give his titles and depict various scenes from his life, such as carrying out inspections of his estate and holding symbols of his office.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no known}} cure for <b>achondroplasia</b> {{even though the}} cause of the {{mutation}} in the growth factor receptor has been found. Although used by those without <b>achondroplasia</b> to aid in growth, human growth hormone does not help people with <b>achondroplasia.</b> However, if desired, the controversial surgery of limb-lengthening will lengthen the legs and arms of someone with <b>achondroplasia.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Achondroplasia</b> {{is caused}} by a {{mutation}} in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). In normal development FGFR3 has a negative regulatory effect on bone growth. In <b>achondroplasia,</b> the mutated form of the receptor is constitutively active and this leads to severely shortened bones. The effect is genetically dominant, with one mutant copy of the FGFR3 gene being sufficient to cause <b>achondroplasia,</b> while two copies of the mutant gene are invariably fatal (recessive lethal) before or shortly after birth (known as a lethal allele). A person with <b>achondroplasia</b> thus has a 50% chance of passing dwarfism to each of their offspring. People with <b>achondroplasia</b> can be born to parents that do not have the condition due to spontaneous mutation.|$|E
25|$|The now-extinct Ancon sheep {{was created}} by humans through the {{selective}} breeding of common domestic sheep with <b>achondroplasia.</b> The average-sized torso combined with the relatively smaller legs produced by <b>achondroplasia</b> was valued for making affected sheep less likely to escape without affecting the amount of wool or meat each sheep produced.|$|E
25|$|<b>Achondroplasia</b> is {{a common}} cause of dwarfism. It occurs as a {{sporadic}} mutation in about 80% of cases (associated with advanced paternal age) {{or it may be}} inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic disorder.|$|E
25|$|A limb anomaly {{is called}} a dysmelia. These include all forms of limbs anomalies, such as amelia, ectrodactyly, phocomelia, polymelia, polydactyly, syndactyly, polysyndactyly, oligodactyly, brachydactyly, <b>achondroplasia,</b> {{congenital}} aplasia or hypoplasia, amniotic band syndrome, and cleidocranial dysostosis.|$|E
25|$|Studies have {{demonstrated}} that new gene mutations for <b>achondroplasia</b> are exclusively inherited from the father and occur during spermatogenesis; it is theorized that oogenesis has some regulatory mechanism that prevents the mutation from being passed on in females.|$|E
25|$|<b>Achondroplasia</b> can be {{detected}} before birth {{by the use of}} prenatal ultrasound. A DNA test can be performed before birth to detect homozygosity, wherein two copies of the mutant gene are inherited, a lethal condition leading to stillbirths. Clinical features include megalocephaly, short limbs, prominent forehead, thoracolumbar kyphosis and mid-facial hypoplasia. Complications like dental malocclusion, hydrocephalus and repeated otitis media can be observed. The risk of death in infancy is increased due to the likelihood of compression of the spinal cord with or without upper airway obstruction.|$|E
25|$|Around a 5% {{increase}} {{in the incidence of}} ventricular septal defects, atrial septal defects, and patent ductus arteriosus in offspring {{has been found to be}} correlated with advanced paternal age. Advanced paternal age has also been linked to increased risk of <b>achondroplasia</b> and Apert syndrome. Offspring born to fathers under the age of 20 show increased risk of being affected by patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defects, and the tetralogy of Fallot. It is hypothesized that this may be due to environmental exposures or lifestyle choices.|$|E
25|$|The typical {{depiction}} of a dwarf in Egyptian art is realistic, showing a normally grown torso and head, but visibly shortened and slightly bent arms and legs. These proportions point to <b>achondroplasia</b> and hypochondroplasia as the conditions responsible for the dwarfism of the individual. Yet, there are also reliefs of small peoples with normal body proportions and it remains unclear if these representations show real pygmies or if these people are represented small in order to reflect their low rank or accentuate the main scene of the relief.|$|E
25|$|Severe {{monogenic}} diseases {{for which}} prenatal diagnosis is more commonly applied to include cystic fibrosis, beta-thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, spinal muscular atrophy, myotonic dystrophy, fragile-X syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Hemophilia. Both autosomal dominant and recessive disorders {{have been detected}} noninvasively by analyzing paternally inherited DNA. Limitations to single gene disorders are autosomal recessive mutation or when the fetal autosomal dominant mutation is maternally inherited. There are also large sequence mutations that include duplication, expansion, insertion of DNA sequences. cffDNA is fragmented with 200-300bp in length, thus these are harder to detect. One example is <b>achondroplasia,</b> a common autosomal dominant form of dwarfism, caused by FGFR3 gene point mutations. Two pregnancies were examined in this study, one fetus {{was found to have}} the paternally inherited G1138A mutation and the other with a G1138A de novo mutation. Another example is the Huntington's disease. It is currently diagnosed at 10–13 weeks at gestation with chronic villus sampling for polymorphic repeats. With qRT-PCR, there has been detection of CAG repeats at 17, 20 and 24, all normal levels.|$|E
500|$|Short stature – Standing {{height is}} reduced due to {{shortened}} legs, arms and trunk, which {{are due to}} a musculoskeletal deficit of bone or cartilage structures. (e.g. <b>achondroplasia,</b> growth hormone deficiency, osteogenesis imperfecta) ...|$|E
500|$|Born in Morristown, New Jersey, {{and raised}} in Brookside, Dinklage is a dwarf (<b>achondroplasia)</b> and stands [...] tall. He began acting {{as a child in}} a fifth-grade {{production}} of The Velveteen Rabbit. He studied acting at Bennington College, starring in a number of amateur stage productions. His film debut was in Living in Oblivion (1995) and his breakthrough came with the comedy-drama The Station Agent (2003). He has since appeared in such films as the comedy Elf (2003), the crime film Find Me Guilty (2006), the superhero comedy Underdog (2007), the fantasy film [...] (2008), the superhero film [...] (2014), and the acclaimed black comedy film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017).|$|E
500|$|Peter Hayden Dinklage {{was born}} on June 11, 1969, in Morristown, New Jersey, to John Carl Dinklage (1931–2004), an {{insurance}} salesman, and Diane Dinklage (b. 1943), an elementary-school music teacher. He was born with <b>achondroplasia,</b> a common form of dwarfism. Dinklage grew up as the only dwarf in his family in Brookside, New Jersey, with his parents and older brother, Jonathan. He is of German and Irish descent. As a child, Dinklage and his brother performed puppet musicals for people in their neighborhood. Dinklage has described his brother, who is a violinist, as being the [...] "real performer of the family", saying that his brother's passion for the violin {{was the only thing}} that kept him from pursuing acting.|$|E
500|$|Dinklage has {{a form of}} dwarfism, <b>achondroplasia,</b> {{which affects}} bone growth. As a result, he is [...] tall, with a typical-sized head and torso but short limbs. While Dinklage has come to accept his condition, he {{sometimes}} found it challenging when growing up. In 2003, he {{said that when he}} was younger he was often angry and bitter about his condition, but as he got older, he realized that he [...] "just ha {{to have a sense of}} humor", to know [...] "that it's not your problem. It's theirs." [...] When asked in 2012 whether he saw himself as [...] "a spokesman for the rights of little people", Dinklage responded: [...] "I don't know what I would say. Everyone's different. Every person my size has a different life, a different history. Different ways of dealing with it. Just because I'm seemingly okay with it, I can't preach how to be okay with it." [...] Dinklage has been viewed as a role model for people sharing his condition.|$|E
2500|$|A {{skeletal}} {{survey is}} useful to confirm the diagnosis of <b>achondroplasia.</b> The skull is large, with a narrow foramen magnum, and relatively small skull base. The vertebral bodies are short and flattened with relatively large intervertebral disk height, and there is congenitally narrowed spinal canal. The iliac wings are small and squared, with a narrow sciatic notch and horizontal acetabular roof. The tubular bones are short and thick with metaphyseal cupping and flaring and irregular growth plates. Fibular overgrowth is present. The hand is broad with short metacarpals and phalanges, and a trident configuration. The ribs are short with cupped anterior ends. If the radiographic features are not classic, {{a search for a}} different diagnosis should be entertained. Because of the extremely deformed bone structure, people with <b>achondroplasia</b> are often [...] "double jointed".|$|E
2500|$|Gene based therapy may {{possibly}} {{serve as}} a future treatment option. BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. [...] in healthy volunteers for vosoritide (BMN-111), an analog of C-type Natriuretic Peptide (CNP), {{for the treatment of}} <b>achondroplasia.</b> In June 2015, BioMarin announced positive results of their Phase 2 study, stating that 10 children experienced a mean increase of 50% in their annualized growth velocity.|$|E
2500|$|People with <b>achondroplasia</b> have short stature, with {{an average}} adult height of [...] for males and [...] for females. Achondroplastic adults {{are known to be}} as short as [...] If both parents are achondroplasic and pass on the mutant gene, then it is very {{unlikely}} that the homozygous child will live past a few months of its life. The prevalence is about 1 in 25,000.|$|E
2500|$|Molecular {{genetics}} {{involves the}} discovery of and laboratory testing for DNA mutations that underlie many single gene disorders. [...] Examples of single gene disorders include <b>achondroplasia,</b> cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, hereditary breast cancer (BRCA1/2), Huntington disease, Marfan syndrome, Noonan syndrome, and Rett syndrome. [...] Molecular tests are also used in the diagnosis of syndromes involving epigenetic abnormalities, such as Angelman syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Prader-willi syndrome, and uniparental disomy.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Achondroplasia</b> {{is one of}} 19 {{congenital}} {{conditions with}} similar presentations, such as osteogenesis imperfecta, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia tarda, achondrogenesis, osteopetrosis, and [...] thanatophoric dysplasia. This makes estimates of prevalence difficult, with changing and subjective diagnostic criteria over time. One detailed and long-running study in the Netherlands found that the prevalence determined at birth was only 1.3 per 100,000 live births. Another study {{at the same time}} found a rate of 1 per 10,000.|$|E
2500|$|A single-gene {{disorder}} {{is the result}} of a single mutated gene. Over 4000 human diseases are caused by single-gene defects. Single-gene disorders can be passed on to subsequent generations in several ways. Genomic imprinting and uniparental disomy, however, may affect inheritance patterns. The divisions between recessive and dominant types are not [...] "hard and fast", although the divisions between autosomal and X-linked types are (since the latter types are distinguished purely based on the chromosomal location of the gene). For example, <b>achondroplasia</b> is typically considered a dominant disorder, but children with two genes for <b>achondroplasia</b> have a severe skeletal disorder of which achondroplasics could be viewed as carriers. Sickle-cell anemia is also considered a recessive condition, but heterozygous carriers have increased resistance to malaria in early childhood, which could be described as a related dominant condition. When a couple where one partner or both are sufferers or carriers of a {{single-gene disorder}} wish to have a child, they can do so through in vitro fertilization, which means they can then have a preimplantation genetic diagnosis to check whether the embryo has the genetic disorder.|$|E
2500|$|A similar form of <b>achondroplasia</b> {{was found}} in a litter of piglets from a phenotypically normal Danish sow. The {{dwarfism}} was inherited dominant in the offspring from this litter. The piglets were born phenotypically normal, but became more and more symptomatic as they reached maturity. This involved a mutation of the protein Collagen, type X, alpha 1, encoded by the COL10A1 gene. [...] In humans a similar mutation (G595E) has been associated with Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (SMCD), a relatively mild skeletal disorder that is also associated with dwarfism.|$|E
2500|$|At age 13, Toulouse-Lautrec {{fractured}} {{his right}} femur. At age 14, he fractured his left. The breaks did not heal properly. Modern physicians attribute this to an unknown genetic disorder, possibly pycnodysostosis (sometimes known as Toulouse-Lautrec Syndrome), or a variant disorder {{along the lines}} of osteopetrosis, <b>achondroplasia,</b> or osteogenesis imperfecta. Rickets aggravated by praecox virilism has also been suggested. Afterwards, his legs ceased to grow, so that as an adult he was extremely short (...) [...] He developed an adult-sized torso, while retaining his child-sized legs. Additionally, he is reported to have had hypertrophied genitals.|$|E
2500|$|Based {{on their}} disproportionate dwarfism, some dog breeds {{traditionally}} have been classified as [...] "achondroplastic." [...] This {{is the case}} for the dachshund, basset hound, corgi and bulldog breeds. Data from whole genome association studies in short-limbed dogs reveal a strong association of this trait with a retro-gene coding for fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4). Therefore, it seems unlikely that dogs and humans are achondroplastic for the same reasons. However, histological studies in some achondroplastic dog breeds have shown altered cell patterns in cartilage that are very similar to those observed in humans exhibiting <b>achondroplasia.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf {{was born}} Henry Joseph Nasiff Jr. on April 20, 1962 in Fall River, Massachusetts. He was {{diagnosed}} with <b>achondroplasia</b> dwarfism a week after he was born. [...] His mother, Claudette, taught him from a young age {{that he could do}} whatever he set his mind to do, and Hank learned to ride a bike and participated in Little League Baseball for several seasons. [...] When Hank was twelve he had an operation on his legs to straighten them. [...] Although doctors had said that he would eventually require more surgery, Hank put off doing it and ultimately opted to not undergo another operation.|$|E
2500|$|Hard tissues such as bone {{require a}} {{relatively}} high energy photon source, and typically a tungsten anode is used with a high voltage (50-150 kVp) on a 3-phase or high-frequency machine to generate bremsstrahlung or braking radiation. [...] Bony tissue and metals are denser than the surrounding tissue, and thus by absorbing more of the X-ray photons they prevent the film from getting exposed as much. [...] Wherever dense tissue absorbs or stops the X-rays, the resulting X-ray film is unexposed, and appears translucent blue, whereas the black parts of the film represent lower-density tissues such as fat, skin, and internal organs, which could not stop the X-rays. [...] This is usually used to see bony fractures, foreign objects (such as ingested coins), and used for finding bony pathology such as osteoarthritis, infection (osteomyelitis), cancer (osteosarcoma), as well as growth studies (leg length, <b>achondroplasia,</b> scoliosis, etc.).|$|E

50|$|<b>Achondroplasia</b> in {{children}} {{is the most}} common form of dwarfism; it accounts for about 70% of all cases of dwarfism. <b>Achondroplasia</b> falls into the category of “disproportionate dwarfism”. It is linked to a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor-3. More than 250,000 people in the world are diagnosed with <b>achondroplasia.</b> <b>Achondroplasia</b> diagnosis occurs somewhere between one in every 10,000 and one in every 30,000 live births.|$|E
50|$|It {{produces}} rhizomelic short limbs, increased spinal curvature, and {{distortion of}} skull growth. In <b>achondroplasia</b> the body's limbs are proportionately {{shorter than the}} trunk (abdominal area), with a larger head than average and characteristic facial features. <b>Achondroplasia</b> is an autosomal dominant disorder caused {{by the presence of}} a faulty allele in the genome. If a pair of <b>achondroplasia</b> alleles are present, the result is fatal. <b>Achondroplasia</b> is a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. In the context of <b>achondroplasia,</b> this mutation causes FGFR3 to become constitutively active, inhibiting bone growth.|$|E

50|$|Defects in the {{development}} and continued division of epiphyseal plates can lead to growth disorders. The most common defect is <b>achondroplasia,</b> where there is a defect in cartilage formation. <b>Achondroplasia</b> is {{the most common cause of}} dwarfism.|$|E

5000|$|The RGA {{can provide}} links to Red Book inserts for {{children}} with <b>Achondroplasia</b> and height charts are available online.

50|$|A {{child may}} be {{diagnosed}} with <b>achondroplasia</b> {{as early as the}} fetal stages of pregnancy.
