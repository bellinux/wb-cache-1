5|$|The {{northern}} <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake has a {{much higher}} salinity, {{to the point that}} the native brine shrimp cannot survive in its waters. In the southern portion, where the vast majority of the fresh water inlets are found, the salt level can dip below what is necessary for the brine shrimp to survive, while water in the northern bay is too salty. The salinity of northern <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake will likely drop as lower salinity from the southern <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake flows into the northern arm. The brine shrimp harvesting industry could benefit from the causeway allowing a freer flow of water. There were concerns from the brine shrimp harvesting industry that the lake conditions in the southern <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake were becoming too saline for the brine shrimp due to several years of lower precipitation in the lake's watershed. The precipitation in the watershed has been above normal for the current water year that begins its tracking October 1, 2016. This additional precipitation has allowed the levels of both arms of the lake to rise, and at least for the near future the conditions for a healthy brine shrimp population seem good.|$|E

After Russia's defeat in the 1905 Russo-Japanese war, her influence had declined, and it was Afghanistan that was at the time seen by Britain as the only power in the sub-continent capable of directly threatening India.|$|E
