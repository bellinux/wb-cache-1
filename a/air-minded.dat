2500|$|France had {{the most}} <b>air-minded</b> army. [...] The balloon school at Chalais-Meudon had long been a centre of innovation, and in [...] December 1909, the French Department of War began to send army {{officers}} and NCOs for pilot training at civilian schools. [...] In March 1910, the Établissement Militaire d'Aviation was created to conduct experiments with aircraft, and on 22 October 1910 the Aéronautique Militaire was created as {{a branch of the}} Army. [...] In February 1912 the French military estimates set aside twelve million francs (equal to nearly half a million pounds) for aviation, and claimed to have 208 aeroplanes, with the intention of increasing that number to 334 {{by the end of the}} year, [...] At this time the British government planned to spend £133,000 on aviation, of which £83,000 was for heavier than air machines.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 May, the British {{fought back}} to the Dunkirk {{perimeter}} line. The Le Paradis massacre took place that day, when the 3rd SS Division Totenkopf machine-gunned 97 British and French prisoners near the La Bassée Canal. The British prisoners were from the 2nd Battalion, Royal Norfolk Regiment, part of the 4th Brigade of the 2nd Division. The SS men lined them {{up against the wall}} of a barn and shot them all; only two survived. Meanwhile, the Luftwaffe dropped bombs and leaflets on the Allied armies. The leaflets showed a map of the situation. They read, in English and French: [...] "British soldiers! Look at the map: it gives your true situation! Your troops are entirely surrounded – stop fighting! Put down your arms!" [...] To the land and <b>air-minded</b> Germans, the sea seemed an impassable barrier, so they believed the Allies were surrounded; but the British saw the sea as a route to safety.|$|E
50|$|By August 1939 Stinson had {{received}} more than 100 orders and the company’s plant at Wayne, Michigan was rolling out three aircraft each day. James Stewart, <b>air-minded</b> Hollywood movie star, and Howard Hughes {{were some of the}} more notable Voyager owners.|$|E

50|$|David O Selznick {{brought in}} Merian C. Cooper, {{first as a}} writer, then {{associate}} producer and finally as executive producer, relying on him to get RKO {{back on its feet}} and in the black. Cooper, best remembered for masterminding the production of King Kong, was also an aviator. It was natural for RKO to feature a slate of <b>air-minded</b> pictures once Cooper was in charge.|$|E
50|$|After the war's end, Diana {{continued}} to fly and gained her commercial flying licence. For many years {{she was a}} volunteer pilot with the Women's Junior Air Corps (WJAC), later the Girls' Venture Corps, giving flights to <b>air-minded</b> teenage girls {{to encourage them to}} enter the aviation industry. In July 1948, an aircraft that she was flying burst into flames near White Waltham. Rather than bail out and lose the WJAC's aircraft, she switched off the fuel and glided the aircraft back.|$|E
5000|$|One unusual {{series was}} {{the cluster of}} four [...] "Ruth Darrow" [...] stories (1930-1931). Written as [...] "Mildred Wirt," [...] the books relate the adventures of an <b>air-minded</b> young woman of the era. Taking flying lessons and flying her own aircraft, Ruth wins a {{national}} cross-country race, lands on an aircraft carrier, helps the Forest Service in fighting forest fires, and alerts the Coast Guard of an immigrant-smuggling scheme. The aeronautical lore in the books is generally authentic, but the series' greatest strength is its consistent and outspoken advocacy of women's abilities and mechanical competence.|$|E
50|$|Former Air Transport Auxiliary Pilot, Diana Barnato Walker {{became a}} pilot for the Women's Junior Air Corps (WJAC) {{shortly after the}} war, giving cadets {{training}} and air-experience flights to <b>air-minded</b> teenage girls {{to encourage them to}} enter the aviation industry. In July 1948, an aircraft that she was flying burst into flames at near White Waltham. Rather than bale out and lose the WJAC’s aircraft, she switch off the fuel and glided the aircraft back. In 1963 she undertook a flight in an English Electric Lightning, attaining 1,262 mph (Mach 1.65) in a two-seat T.4 trainer and thus became the first British woman to exceed the speed of sound.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} of the release of The High and the Mighty, it {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Variety wrote that the film [...] "is a class drama, blended with mass appeal into a well-rounded show that can catch on with most any audience." [...] Edwin Schallert of the Los Angeles Times called the film [...] "an enormously vital picture, amazingly associated with life's panorama today, and thus filled with a rare kind of tingling excitement, especially for a modern <b>air-minded</b> public." [...] Joseph Henry Jackson, writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, said that the film has [...] "a story that gives you no time to catch your breath".|$|E

50|$|In 1920 Fairchild {{was visiting}} Miami and {{realized}} that the land boom in progress was crowding out the two gardens. He heard {{that there was an}} Army air corps training field called Chapman Field that was being declared surplus. He and his chief explorer, Wilson Popenoe, met with John Weeks, Secretary of War, who approved of the transfer to the USDA. Fairchild thought he was getting the entire 800 acres but some citizens of Miami who were as <b>air-minded</b> as he was plant-minded chiseled away all but 95 acres which was secured permanently by an agreement bearing President Coolidge's signature. Over time the station gained an additional 65 acres and finally in 1947 another 37 acres for the current total of 197 acres. Starting in 1923 plant material was transferred from the two original gardens to Chapman Field. After the 1926 hurricane severely damaged the original gardens, they were returned to their donors. Ev Sewell assisted in getting the Aero Gunners' School for the Army located at Chapman Field. This base cost the government nearly a million dollars. The field was named after Victor Chapman, the first American flyer to die in France during the First World War. On the land not used by the USDA the government maintained an airfield used by army reservists for bombing practice. During the Second World War the field was outsourced to Embry-Riddle to train pilots. Chapman Field was also the location of Coastal Patrol Base #7 of the Civil Air Patrol during 1942-1943.|$|E
