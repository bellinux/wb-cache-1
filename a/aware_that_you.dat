Immediately after taking the oath of office in the East Room of the White House, he spoke to the assembled audience in a speech broadcast live to the nation. Ford noted the peculiarity of his position: [...] "I am acutely <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have not elected me as your president by your ballots, and so I ask you to confirm me as your president with your prayers."

500|$|Shortly {{before the}} game's release, IGN posted {{a review of}} the game, citing {{numerous}} bugs and crashes in the PlayStation 3 release. The game also contained a bug, causing the game to freeze and the screen to blur when friends signed out of and into the PlayStation Network. The IGN review was edited shortly thereafter, removing all references to the PS3 version's bugs, causing controversy in the PlayStation communities. Reviewing PlayStation 3 Game of the Year edition, Digital Chumps and Spawn Kill confirmed that most bugs remained, citing occasional freezes, several animation and scripting issues, along with other bugs, requiring a restart of the game. Even IGN retroactively cited bugs with the original release as well as the Game of the Year edition, calling it [...] "a fantastic game", but warned players to [...] "be <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> might have to deal with some crashes and bugs".|$|E

2500|$|To Nimoy's surprise, Spock {{became a}} sex symbol; Isaac Asimov {{described}} the character as [...] "a security blanket with sexual overtones", and Nimoy reported that [...] "I've never had more female {{attention on a}} set before.

2500|$|As head {{of naval}} logistics, Horne was the Navy's {{principal}} {{point of contact}} for the Truman Committee, a special Senate committee headed by Senator Harry S. Truman that was charged with investigating waste, corruption, and profiteering in the wartime defense industry. Called to testify about alleged waste in the Pacific theater, Horne unapologetically retorted {{that it was impossible}} to run a war effort on that scale without some waste. [...] "I don't deny for a moment that there are billions of dollars worth of materiel out on Pearl Harbor and elsewhere in the Pacific.... But I just have to resolve the balance in favor of giving the commanders what they say they need, and at the same time, I'm fully <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> gentlemen are interested, as I am, in saving. So where we can cure the waste, we're doing it, but we're not going to stop short." ...|$|E
2500|$|Arturo Toscanini, a {{prominent}} anti-fascist, was furious {{to learn that}} Furtwängler {{would be at the}} Festival. He accepted his engagement in Salzburg on the condition that he would not have to meet Furtwängler. But the two did meet, and argued over Furtwängler's actions. Toscanini argued: [...] "I know quite well that you are {{not a member of the}} Party. I am also <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have helped your Jewish friends [...] But everyone who conducts in the Third Reich is a Nazi!". Furtwängler emphatically denied this and said: [...] "By that, you imply that art and music are merely propaganda, a false front, as it were, for any Government which happens to be in power. If a Nazi Government is in power, then, as a conductor, I am a Nazi; under the communists, I would be a Communist; under the democrats, a democrat... No, a thousand times no! Music belongs to a different world, and is above chance political events." [...] Toscanini disagreed and that ended the discussion.|$|E

2500|$|In 1942, Buñuel {{applied for}} American citizenship, because he {{anticipated}} that MoMA {{would soon be}} put under federal control. [...] But that same year, Dalí published his autobiography, The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí, in which {{he made it clear}} that he had split with Buñuel because the latter was a Communist and an atheist. News of this reached Archbishop Spellman, who [...] angrily confronted Barry with the question: [...] "Are you <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are harbouring in this Museum the Antichrist, the man who made a blasphemous film L'Age d'Or?" [...] At the same time, a campaign on the part of Hollywood, through its industry trade paper, the Motion Picture Herald, to undermine the MoMA film unit resulted in a 66% reduction in the department's budget and Buñuel felt himself compelled to resign. [...] In 1944, he returned to Hollywood for the third time, this time as Spanish Dubbing Producer for Warner Brothers. Before leaving New York, he confronted Dalí at his hotel, the Sherry Netherland, to tell the painter about the damage his book had done and then shoot him in the knee. Buñuel did not carry out the violent part of his plan. Dalí explained himself by saying: [...] "I did not write my book to put YOU on a pedestal. I wrote it to put ME on a pedestal".|$|E
2500|$|In February 1815, Commodore John Rodgers was {{appointed}} the President of the Board of Navy Commissioners. [...] The law creating the Board gave it authority over procurement of naval stores, supplies and material as these {{related to the}} construction of naval vessels, outfitting of ships, armament and equipment plus oversight authority over naval shipyards, stations and dry-docks. The BNC also regulating civilian employment and pay. Serving with Rodgers on the Board were Commodores David Porter and Isaac Hull. The BNC found all current yards to have shortcomings. One of the most important recommendations the BNC made during Rodgers tenure was that only Portsmouth and Boston Navy Yard were suitable for the building of large ships in all seasons. Though the BNC recommended Washington Navy Yard be retained its report noted, “The Yard at Washington, when viewed as building yard only, would be less objectionable [...] were the navigation deeper and the obstructions fewer. But it is the decided opinion of the Board, that the obstructions and its distance from the sea render it unsuitable for every other purpose.” [...] The Board recommended Baltimore, Norfolk and Charleston navy yards be closed. These recommendations were controversial and became the subject of considerable partisanship, with only Baltimore and Charleston eventually phased out of existence. The BNC final report was in fact, highly critical of the Washington Navy Yard and its business practices. Writing on 11 May 1815 to Commodore Thomas Tingey the BNC stated, [...] "The Board are about contracting for the repairs of the Black Smith shop in the Navy Yard under your command for the purpose of employing workmen to put in order for service & a state of preservation ... It is the intention of the Board of the Navy Commissioners, to reestablish the Navy Yard at this place, as a building Yard only, & while stating to you this intention, it may not be improper for them to make you acquainted with their views generally with respect to the establishment. They have witnessed in many of our Navy Yards & this particularly pressure in the employment of characters unsuited for the public service – maimed & unmanageable slaves for the accommodation of distressed widows & orphans & indigent families - apprentices for the accommodation of their masters – & old men & children for the benefit of their families & parents [...] These practices must cease – none must be employed but for the advantage of the public, & this Yard instead of rendering the navy odious to the nation from the scenes of want & extravagance which it has too long exhibited must serve as a model on which to prefect a general system of economy. In making to you,- Sir, these remarks the Navy Commissioners are <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have with themselves long witnessed the evils of which they complain, & which every countenance will be given to assist you in remedying them, they calculate with confidence on a disposition on your part to forward the public interests.” [...] From November 1824 through May 1827, he commanded the Mediterranean Squadron. After his final naval command, returned to New York where he became the Navy agent at the port there.|$|E
