25|$|Two {{substantial}} foghorns {{with concrete}} housings {{were built in}} 1866, one {{at the north end}} of the island near the Swine Cave reached by 'the Loups' path and the other at East Trammins on the south end. Both were powered by compressed air that was piped from the lighthouse, where a gas powered compressor was housed until 1911 when oil-powered engines were installed. One of the compressed <b>air</b> <b>pipelines</b> can still be seen within 'the Loups' path that was constructed above it. The compressed air cylinders that held the required store of air are still prominent features, especially at the Trammins foghorn.

40|$|An {{approach}} is proposed {{to determine the}} optimal air compressor location in a manufacturing facility. The optimization strategy {{is based on an}} objective function that minimizes the total energy consumption of the air compressor -thereby decreasing the energy cost -in the manufacturing facility. Compressor distance to air demand, air pressure, load factor and volume are all factors considered in the model. The proposed model determines the facility's attributes based on user inputs of facility size. The model then divides the facility into zones and creates a zone-to-zone distance matrix within the prescribed facility. Demand and pressure profiles of the facility are created based on the equipment and tools present in each zone. The model also determines the ideal air compressor horsepower required to meet the facility air demand at the required pressure. Air pressure drops are incorporated using a compressed <b>air</b> <b>pipeline</b> pressure drop table, while air leaks are calculated throughout the system using novel and conservative estimation technique. Facility shape and facility temperature profile used to ensure safe and proper operation of the air compressor are also considered in the objective function...|$|E
40|$|The {{pipe system}} roles {{as a main}} bridge between {{membrane}} modules and pumps in membrane water treatment plants. Membrane operation modes generally consist of filtration and backwash processes in a normal mode, a pressure decay test as an integrity test and a chemical circulation through pipe system in a cleaning mode. Thus factors effecting on membrane performance should be sufficiently considered before design and operation. This study evaluated flow analysis for vi-bration diagnostic and evaluation of the fatigue lifetime in the microfiltration system applied for a drinking water treatment plant. Vibration of main membrane pipelines was measured to identify the source of vibration. Also natural frequency and fluid dynamics was calculated by computa-tional fluid dynamics. It showed that maximum magnitude frequencies were at 12 Hz and 22 Hz, respectively at water and <b>air</b> <b>pipeline</b> during filtration and backwash. Backwash process caused mainly vibration on the backwash water pipe. The calculated frequency from analysis of frequency response and CFD was in a good agreement with the measured frequency. Fatigue analysis showed that pipelines were getting little damage caused by vibration.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine barning conditions of dairy farms registered to Cattle Breeders Association (CBA) Ödemiş district of İzmir. The 92 farms were selected among members of the CBA by proportional sampling method. The farms were divided into three groups according to the number of cattle: group 1 from 5 to 20, group 2 from 21 to 40 and group 3 with over 41 heads, respectively. The farms were divided into three groups according to the number of cattle: 5 - 20; 21 - 40 and over 41 heads, respectively. The research results indicated that 76. 1 % of the barns were shed type, 15. 2 % were corral, 8. 7 % were completely closed-up. The flooring types of these barns were a mixed of concrete and soil (73. 9 %), concrete (19. 6 %) and soil (6. 5 %). The stocking density for group 1, 2 and 3 were 22. 2 m 2, 19. 5 m 2 and 18. 2 m 2 per cow, respectively. The barns had a range of full cattle capacity from 12. 5 m 2 to 15 m 2 per cow. But none of the farms surveyed did not use fully capacity of the barn. The present running capacity of farms were between 55 % and 80 %. It was observed that 19. 6 % of farms had a individual calf section, 82. 6 % had a night lighting at the barn, and 64. 1 % had a seperate concenrated feed store. All the farms were milked with milking machines. The percentage of farms with bucked milking machine was 47. 8 %, those with an <b>air</b> <b>pipeline</b> system was 37 % and those with parlour system was 15. 2 %. None of farms had manure pit. Consequently, as herd size grow, the presence of free barn, calving pen, feed store and milk cooling tank increase.

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{estimation of}} the total <b>pipeline</b> <b>air</b> pressure drop is considered widely {{to be one of}} the most important aspects of pneumatic conveying system design. Since there are numerous influential parameters, such as velocity, particle properties, pipe length, diameter and material, the determination of the total <b>pipeline</b> <b>air</b> pressure drop in pipelines of different length, diameter, step and bend number is based largely on the scale-up of test rig data. In many systems, the air-only component of pressure drop is significant (e. g. dilutephase, long-distance conveying). This thesis modifies initially the correlations for predicting pressure drop caused by an incompressible fluid flowing through bends and straight sections of pipe. These correlations are sufficientiy accurate as long as mean conditions (based on average air density) for each straight pipe and conditions at the outlet of each bend are used in the analysis. Based on detailed mathematical and dimensional analyses, semi-empirical correlations then are set up for predicting the pressure drop due to the presence of solids in bends and straight pipes. Fly ash is used as the test material. B y using the data from any constant diameter pipeline with one bend and two long straight pipes, the exponents in the semi-empirical correlations are determined. These correlations then are used to predict the total <b>pipeline</b> <b>air</b> pressure drop in pipelines of different length, diameter and bend number. A close agreement between predicted and experimental results is obtained as long as there are no short straight pipes in the pipeline. However, in industry, short straight pipes are in c o m m o n use. It is found that the previously 2 ̆ 7 determined 2 ̆ 7 values of exponents underpredict significantly the total <b>pipeline</b> <b>air</b> pressure drop in pipelines that contain short straight pipes. Therefore, the semi-empirical correlation for bend pressure drop is modified by determining the exponents from data obtained on a simple configuration of constant diameter pipeline, which comprises two bends and three sections of pipe, two long and one short. The operating conditions of several pipeline having different lengths and diameters are predicted accurately and this demonstrates the good reliability and stability of this n e w scale-up procedure. Finally, the results from two other test materials with significantly different particle properties (viz. pulverised coal and plastic pellets) demonstrate further the high accuracy and reliability of the scale-up procedure developed in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|The braking {{coordination}} between tractor and semitrailer {{is vital to}} the safety of articulated vehicles. Traditional evaluation about braking coordination is based on the pressure measurement along <b>air</b> braking <b>pipeline,</b> which needs to change original braking structure to install gauges and cannot directly reflect the final braking coordination of different wheels. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel dynamic measurement system for evaluating the braking coordination of articulated vehicles. During the brake test, all wheel velocities of the whole articulated vehicle are synchronously obtained through a specially designed distributed acquisition platform. To effectively eliminate gross errors and noises in wheel angular velocity data, a 3 -order autoregressive (AR) model and an improved-thresholding wavelet filtering algorithm are developed. Further, a novel direct evaluation method about braking coordination is proposed according to the differences in angular velocity dropping time of all wheels. Finally, the overall system is assessed through real field tests. The results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system...|$|R
