5|$|Other commercially {{valuable}} products from birds include feathers (especially the down of geese <b>and</b> <b>ducks),</b> {{which are used}} as insulation in clothing and bedding, and seabird faeces (guano), which is a valuable source of phosphorus and nitrogen. The War of the Pacific, sometimes called the Guano War, was fought in part over the control of guano deposits.|$|E

50|$|Traditional {{meat for}} confit include both {{waterfowl}} such as goose <b>and</b> <b>duck,</b> <b>and</b> pork. <b>Duck</b> gizzards are also commonly cooked in the confit method. Varying forms of this delicacy thrive throughout southern France.|$|R
5|$|The river {{system has}} also long {{been home to}} bird life. The {{negative}} effects of human development have not as significantly affected birds as fish due to the more limited changes to bird habitat (which includes the forests which still remain on surrounding mountains). There are more than 130 species of birds which frequent the river system, these include starlings <b>and</b> <b>ducks</b> as well as migratory birds such as cranes and ibis.|$|E
5|$|At certain dates, food may be set {{out as a}} {{sacrifice}} to {{the spirits of the}} deceased or the gods, such as during the Qingming Festival. This may include slaughtered animals, such as pigs <b>and</b> <b>ducks,</b> or fruit. Another form of sacrifice involves the burning of Joss paper, or Hell Bank Notes, on the assumption that images thus consumed by the fire will reappear—not as a mere image, but as the actual item—in the spirit world, making them available for revered ancestors and departed loved ones. At other points, a vegan diet or full fast may be observed.|$|E
5|$|Each year in {{late summer}} {{thousands}} of black swans <b>and</b> <b>ducks</b> descend on the area as the inland waterways they inhabit dry up. Waterbirds such as pelicans, cormorants, oyster catchers and terns are common often year round. Egrets, ibis, herons and spoonbills feed on the seagrass and fairy wrens, chats, fantails and thornbills feed on insects and plants amongst the samphire. Each September stints and sandpipers arrive from the Northern Hemisphere in a spectacular display. With the abundance of birdlife the area attracts birds of prey with swamp harriers, collared sparrowhawks, black-shouldered kites, kestrels and little falcons are all seen in the skies over St Kilda.|$|E
30|$|Multiple {{alignments}} of mtDNA ND 5 and cytb gene from cat, human, dog, pig, cattle, sheep, goat, horse, goose, chicken, <b>and</b> <b>duck</b> {{were performed}} using Clustal X. We designed two assays targeting chicken <b>and</b> <b>duck</b> mtDNA ND 5 and cytb gene, the expected amplicon sizes being 172 and 263  bp, respectively (Table  1).

5000|$|Chicken <b>and</b> <b>duck</b> blood soup {{was invented}} by little-known Shanghainese hawker Xu Fuquan, who made the dish by mixing hot chicken <b>and</b> <b>duck</b> blood with the head and feet of a chicken, before boiling it in an iron pot, which he dubbed a [...] "metal cow". In 1973, {{during his visit to}} Shanghai, then-King of Cambodia Norodom Sihanouk tried chicken <b>and</b> <b>duck</b> blood soup <b>and</b> {{reportedly}} enjoyed the dish a lot, having consumed countless bowls of it.|$|R

5|$|In some countries, geese <b>and</b> <b>ducks</b> are force-fed {{to produce}} livers with an {{exceptionally}} high fat {{content for the}} production of foie gras. Over 75% of world production of this product occurs in France, with lesser industries in Hungary and Bulgaria and a growing production in China. Foie gras is considered a luxury {{in many parts of the}} world, but the process of feeding the birds in this way is banned in many countries on animal welfare grounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{greylag goose}} (Anser anser) was domesticated by the Egyptians at least 3000 years ago, and a {{different}} wild species, the swan goose (Anser cygnoides), domesticated in Siberia about a thousand years later, {{is known as a}} Chinese goose. The two hybridise with each other and the large knob {{at the base of the}} beak, a noticeable feature of the Chinese goose, is present to a varying extent in these hybrids. The hybrids are fertile and have resulted in several of the modern breeds. Despite their early domestication, geese have never gained the commercial importance of chickens <b>and</b> <b>ducks.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{wide range}} of birds were eaten, {{including}} swans, peafowl, quail, partridge, storks, cranes, larks, linnets and other songbirds that could be trapped in nets, and just about any other wild bird that could be hunted. Swans and peafowl were domesticated to some extent, but were only eaten by the social elite, and more praised for their fine appearance as stunning entertainment dishes, entremets, than for their meat. As today, geese <b>and</b> <b>ducks</b> had been domesticated but were not as popular as the chicken, the fowl equivalent of the pig. Curiously enough the barnacle goose was believed to reproduce not by laying eggs like other birds, but by growing in barnacles, and was hence considered acceptable food for fast and Lent. But at the Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215), Pope Innocent III explicitly prohibited the eating of barnacle geese during Lent, arguing that they lived and fed like ducks and so were of the same nature as other birds.|$|E

30|$|To make {{standard}} plasmids, the purified chicken <b>and</b> <b>duck</b> ND 5 <b>and</b> cytb gene {{products of}} traditional PCR were cloned using the pMD 19 -T vector (Takara, Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan), and were then sequenced. The plasmids with correct target genes were extracted using TIANprep MINI plasmid kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China). Standard curves of chicken <b>and</b> <b>duck</b> ND 5 <b>and</b> cytb were generated using tenfold serial dilutions (9.70  ×  107  −  100 and 1.08  ×  108  −  101 copies per μL respectively) of standard plasmids containing chicken <b>and</b> <b>duck</b> ND 5 or cytb genes.|$|R
5|$|Brood parasitism, {{in which}} an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual's brood, is more common among birds than {{any other type of}} organism. After a {{parasitic}} bird lays her eggs in another bird's nest, they are often accepted and raised by the host {{at the expense of the}} host's own brood. Brood parasites may be either obligate brood parasites, which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young, or non-obligate brood parasites, which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of conspecifics to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young. One hundred bird species, including honeyguides, icterids, <b>and</b> <b>ducks,</b> are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the cuckoos. Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host's young, which allows them to destroy the host's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host's chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks.|$|E
5|$|Christiansen and Tschopp (2010) {{state that}} {{presence}} of a horny sheath in Hesperosaurus is a strong indication that the plates had primarily a defensive function, as a horn layer would have strengthened the plate {{as a whole and}} provided it with sharp cutting edges. Also the display function would have been reinforced, because the sheath would have increased the visible surface and such horn structures are often brightly colored. Thermoregulation, on the other hand would have been hampered by an extra insulating layer and the smoothness of the surface, but cannot be entirely ruled out as extant cattle <b>and</b> <b>ducks</b> use horns and beaks to dump excess heat despite the keratin covering. A 2015 study of the shapes and sizes of Hespersaurus plates suggested that they were sexually dimorphic, with wide plates belonging to males and taller plates belonging to females.|$|E
5|$|Poultry, {{kept for}} their eggs {{and for their}} meat, include chickens, turkeys, geese <b>and</b> <b>ducks.</b> The great {{majority}} of laying birds used for egg production are chickens. Methods for keeping layers range from free-range systems, where the birds can roam as they will but are housed at night for their own protection, through semi-intensive systems where they are housed in barns and have perches, litter and some freedom of movement, to intensive systems where they are kept in cages. The battery cages are arranged in long rows in multiple tiers, with external feeders, drinkers, and egg collection facilities. This is the most labour saving and economical method of egg production but has been criticised on animal welfare grounds as the birds are unable to exhibit their normal behaviours.|$|E

5|$|The reedbeds, {{the largest}} of which are at the Cley, Salthouse and Titchwell reserves, are {{dominated}} by common reed, and salt marsh rush, brackish water crowfoot, sea clubrush and common bulrush also occur in the various wetland habitats. The coastal pastures at Cley and Salthouse Marshes have jointleaf rush, common silverweed, and less common grasses such as annual beard grass, marsh foxtail, and slender hare's-ear. The flat land just inland from the dunes at Holkham was reclaimed from the marshes by {{the nineteenth century and}} was initially used for grazing. It was made arable during World War II, but the water levels have been raised to make the fields attractive to breeding and wintering birds. The pastures are of international importance for {{the tens of thousands of}} geese <b>and</b> <b>ducks</b> that feed there in the winter months.|$|E
5|$|While loss {{of habitat}} has {{affected}} native {{animals such as}} the pine marten, elk, woodland caribou, and bison, others like whitetail deer and bobcat thrive. The state has the nation's largest population of timber wolves outside Alaska, and supports healthy populations of black bears, moose, and gophers. Located on the Mississippi Flyway, Minnesota hosts migratory waterfowl such as geese <b>and</b> <b>ducks,</b> and game birds such as grouse, pheasants, and turkeys. It is home to birds of prey, including {{the largest number of}} breeding pairs of bald eagles in the lower 48 states as of 2007, red-tailed hawks, and snowy owls. The lakes teem with sport fish such as walleye, bass, muskellunge, and northern pike, and streams in the southeast and northeast are populated by brook, brown, and rainbow trout.|$|E

5|$|The House of Venus, {{towards the}} eastern side of the city under a {{prominent}} cypress tree, was one of the most luxurious residences in the city. It had a set of private baths and a richly decorated interior, with fine mosaics dating from the 2nd century AD showing animal and mythological scenes. There were mosaics in seven corridors and eight rooms. The central courtyard has a fanciful mosaic depicting racing chariots in a hippodrome, drawn by teams of peacocks, geese <b>and</b> <b>ducks.</b> The mosaic of Venus for which the house is named has been removed to Tangier, but in the next-door room is a still-extant mosaic showing Diana and a companion nymph being surprised by Actaeon while bathing. Actaeon is depicted with horns beginning to sprout from his head as he is transformed by the angry goddess into a stag, before being chased down and killed by his own hunting dogs. The house appears to have been destroyed some time after the city's fall around 280; a mosaic depicting Cupids feeding birds with grain has been charred by what appears to have been a fire burning directly on top of it, perhaps resulting from the building being taken over by squatters who used the mosaic as the site of a hearth.|$|E
