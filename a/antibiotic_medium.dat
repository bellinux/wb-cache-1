50|$|Site {{directed}} mutagenesis {{is a valuable}} technique that allows for the replacement of a single base in an oligonucleotide or gene. The basics of this technique involve the preparation of a primer {{that will be a}} complementary strand to a wild type bacterial plasmid. This primer will have a base pair mismatch at the site where the replacement is desired. The primer must also be long enough such that the primer will anneal to the wild type plasmid. After the primer anneals, a DNA polymerase will complete the primer. When the bacterial plasmid is replicated, the mutated strand will be replicated as well. The same technique can be used to create a gene insertion or deletion. Often, an antibiotic resistant gene is inserted along with the modification of interest and the bacteria are cultured on an <b>antibiotic</b> <b>medium.</b> The bacteria that were not successfully mutated will not survive on this medium, and the mutated bacteria can easily be cultured.|$|E

40|$|Although {{reliable}} {{detection of}} resistance in vitro {{is critical to}} the overall performance of any susceptibility testing method, the recently released National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards M 27 -A methodology for susceptibility testing of yeasts discriminates poorly between resistant and susceptible isolates of Candida spp. We have previously shown that both substitution of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>medium</b> 3 for RPMI 1640 medium in the microdilution variant of the M 27 -A method and use of the E-test agar diffusion methodology permit detection of amphotericin B-resistant Candida isolates.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{antibiotics}} {{used for}} prophylaxis during surgery {{may influence the}} rate of surgical site infections. Tetracyclines are attractive having a long half-life and few side effects when used in a single dose regimen. We studied the rate of surgical site infections during changing regimens of <b>antibiotic</b> prophylaxis in <b>medium</b> and major size surgery. Methods Prospective registration of surgical site infection following intestinal resections and hysterectomies was performed. Possible confounding procedure and patient related factors were registered. The study included 1541 procedures and 1489 controls. The registration included time periods when the regimen was changed from doxycycline to cephalothin and back again. Results The SSI in the colorectal department increased from 19 % to 30 % (p = 0. 002) when doxycycline was substituted with cephalothin and decreased to 17 % when we changed back to doxycycline (p = 0. 005). In the gynaecology department the surgical site infection rate did not increase significantly. Subgroup analysis showed major changes in infections in rectal resections from 20 % to 35 % (p = 0. 02) and back to 12 % (p = 0. 003).

In general, five distinct phases {{in the growth of}} filamentous fungi could be distinguished, namely, the lag phase, the first transition period, the log phase, the second transition period, and the stationary phase. The growth curves were smooth and were characterized by the presence of long transition periods. Among the different growth phases distinguished, the smallest variability in growth rates among the strains of each species was found during the log phase in all nutrient media. The different growth phases of filamentous fungi were barely distinguishable in RPMI 1640, in which the poorest growth was observed for all fungi even when the medium was supplemented with 2 % glucose. R. microsporus and A. fumigatus grew better in Sabouraud and yeast nitrogen base medium than in RPMI 1640, with growth rates three to four times higher. None of the media provided optimal growth of S. prolificans. The germination of Rhizopus spores and Aspergillus and Scedosporium conidia commenced after 2 and 5 h of incubation, respectively. The elongation rates ranged from 39. 6 to 26. 7, 25. 4 to 20. 2, and 16. 9 to 9. 9 microm/h for Rhizopus, Aspergillus, and Scedoporium hyphae, respectively. The germination of conidia and spores and the elongation rates of hyphae were enhanced in <b>antibiotic</b> <b>medium</b> 3 and delayed in yeast nitrogen base medium.
