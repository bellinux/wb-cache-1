5000|$|Food {{security}} {{indicators and}} measures {{are derived from}} country level household income and expenditure surveys to estimate per capita caloric availability. In general the objective of food security indicators and measures is to capture {{some or all of}} the main components of food security in terms of food availability, access and utilization or adequacy. While availability (production and supply) and utilization/adequacy (nutritional status/anthropometric measures) seemed much easier to estimate, thus more popular, access (ability to acquire sufficient quantity and quality) remain largely elusive. The factors influencing household food access are often context specific. Thus the financial and technical demands of collecting and analyzing data on all aspects of household's experience of food access and the development of valid and clear measures remain a huge challenge.Nevertheless, several measures have been developed that aim to capture the <b>access</b> <b>component</b> of food security, with some notable examples developed by the USAID-funded Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance (FANTA) project, collaborating with Cornell and Tufts University and Africare and World Vision.

40|$|Introduction: One of {{the most}} {{important}} components of emergency medical services (EMS) which {{plays a major role in}} reducing mortality and disability of victims is access to healthcare services. Equitable access to healthcare services requires providing essential andaccessible services for all people without imposing any financial burden on them. The aim of this study was to determine and prioritize the <b>components</b> of <b>access</b> to EMS in Iran. Methods: This study is a descriptive and cross-sectional study that has done in the first half of 2010 in Iran using DEMATEL method. The data about the <b>access</b> <b>components</b> of EMS in different systems was collected using researcher-made questionnaire. Afterwards, a sample of 30 Iranian experts in EMS who were selected using purposive sampling method were asked to evaluate the suggestions and revise the collected components using their scientific, practical and visionary experience. Then, the components were identified using Delphi method. The priority of components was depicted using MATLAB and Edraw Max 5 softwares. Results: Capitation, third party insurance, insurance for non-traffics cases, the budget of some especial organizations such as the tobacco companies, etc., distribution of facilities based on the characteristics of each region and distribution of facilities in urban areas based on the population density were determined as <b>access</b> <b>components.</b> Also, The components of third party insurance and capitation were determined as the most affecting and affected <b>access</b> <b>components</b> with the coordinates (1. 44 and 1. 44) and (0. 09 and - 0. 09) respectively, on the pre-hospital emergency <b>access</b> <b>components</b> graph. Conclusion: Given the limited resources to access EMS, alternatives should be taken into consideration. Considering the high number of deaths from traffic accidents in Iran, part of car insurance premiums should be allocated to provide emergency services for people injured. Some Iranian organizations such as tobacco companies, oil manufacturing companies, etc. have a major role in cardio-vascular diseases outbreaks. Given that cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of deaths in Iran, such organizations should pay costs of these diseases spreads and outbreaks...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{concept of}} food {{insecurity}} encompasses three dimensions. One of these dimensions, the <b>access</b> <b>component</b> of household food insecurity is measured {{through the use}} of the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS). Despite its application in Ethiopia and other similar developing countries, its performance is still poorly explored. Our study aims to evaluate the validity of the HFIAS in Ethiopia. Methods We conducted repeated cross-sectional studies in urban and rural villages of the Butajera District in southern Ethiopia. The validation was conducted on a pooled sample of 1, 516 households, which were selected using a simple random sampling method. The HFIAS was translated into the local Amharic language and tested for face validity. We also evaluated the tool&# 8217;s internal consistency using Cronbach&# 8217;s alpha and factor analysis. We tested for parallelism on HFIAS item response curves across wealth status and further evaluated the presence of a dose-response relationship between the food insecurity level and the consumption of food items, as well as between household wealth status and food insecurity. Additionally, we evaluated the reproducibility of the tool through the first and second round of HFIAS scores. Results The HFIAS exhibited a good internal consistency (Cronbach&# 8217;s alpha for the values of rounds 1 and 2 were 0. 76 and 0. 73, respectively). A factor analysis (varimax rotation) resulted in two main factors: the first factor described a level of mild to moderate food insecurity, while the second factor described severe food insecurity. HFIAS item response curves were parallel across wealth status in the sample households, with a dose-response trend between food insecurity levels and the likelihood of previous day food consumption being observed. The overall HFIAS score did not change over the two rounds of data collection. Conclusions The HFIAS is a simple and valid tool to measure the <b>access</b> <b>component</b> of household food insecurity. However, we recommend the adaptation of questions and wordings and adding examples before application, as we found a discrepancy in understanding of some of the nine HFIAS questions...|$|E
