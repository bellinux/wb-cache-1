50|$|Ix Tab is {{the female}} form of ah tab 'hangman'. The {{function}} of Ix Tab as a benevolent 'hangwoman' could derive from a basic association with snares. Landa (Tozzer 1941: 155) mentions the hunting deity Ah Tabay ('Ensnarer' or 'Deceiver'), possibly a patron of hunting with snares, including such that hoist the prey into the <b>air.</b> Animals <b>hoisted</b> by such snares are found {{depicted in the}} Dresden and Madrid codices, the Madrid codex (MC45c) personifying one of these traps by a male hunting deity. Ix Tab could {{be understood as a}} specialized, female form of such a deity, luring the human quarry into the hanging rope personified by her. Suicides freely putting their heads into this 'snare' (prompted, perhaps, by a dream) could then be seen to consecrate themselves to her. On the other hand, the Xtabay of contemporary folklore is a seductive female demon ‘ensnaring’ or 'deceiving' her male preys so as to madden and destroy them.|$|R
