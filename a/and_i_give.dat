25|$|Today, I, a faithless sinner, renew in {{your hands}} my Baptismal vows; I renounce Satan forever, his pomps and works; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>give</b> myself entirely to Jesus Christ, the Incarnate Wisdom, and will carry my cross after Him all the days of my life, and will be more {{faithful}} to Him than I have ever been. With the entire heavenly court as my witness, I choose you this day for my Mother. I deliver and consecrate myself to you, my body and soul, myself, both interior and exterior, and the worth of my good actions, past, present and future; leaving to you the total right of disposing of me, and all that belongs to me, according to your wish, for the greater glory of God in time and in eternity.|$|E
500|$|Writing {{began in}} late 2009, when the American singer Holly Hafermann resided at the Artula Retreat in Bandon, Oregon, and {{composed}} songs. Later, in New York City, under her new stage name Skylar Grey, she visited her Universal Music publisher, Jennifer Blakeman, {{to seek help}} presenting her work; Blakeman suggested she collaborate with Alex da Kid. The producer emailed Grey his track, which suggested a theme of abusive romantic relationships {{to her as she}} spontaneously sang lyrics to the melody. She told the Los Angeles Times that she was in an abusive relationship with the music industry: [...] "I love it so much, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>give</b> it all that I have, yet it beats me down." [...] This idea inspired her writing, a process she found came naturally, as if she were creating an alternative pop song for herself. She wrote the chorus to [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] in fifteenminutes and recorded vocals for Alex da Kid's demo.|$|E
500|$|Finally, a Bedouin story {{states that}} Allah created the Arabian horse {{from the south}} wind and exclaimed, [...] "I create thee, Oh Arabian. To thy forelock, I bind Victory in battle. On thy back, I set a rich spoil and a Treasure in thy loins. I {{establish}} thee {{as one of the}} Glories of the Earth... I give thee flight without wings." [...] Other versions of the story claim Allah said to the South Wind: [...] "I want to make a creature out of you. Condense." [...] Then from the material condensed from the wind, he made a kamayt-colored animal (a bay or burnt chestnut) and said: [...] "I call you Horse; I make you Arabian <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>give</b> you the chestnut color of the ant; I have hung happiness from the forelock which hangs between your eyes; you shall be the Lord of the other animals. Men shall follow you wherever you go; you shall be as good for flight as for pursuit; you shall fly without wings; riches shall be on your back and fortune shall come through your meditation." ...|$|E

2500|$|In [...] Jesus states that: [...] "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, {{and they}} follow me: <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>give</b> unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish." [...] This {{refers to the}} personal, heart to heart {{relationship}} the Christian {{is expected to have}} with Jesus.|$|E
2500|$|Newman also {{experienced}} intense male friendships, the first with Richard Hurrell Froude (1803–1836), the longest with Ambrose St John (1815–1875), who shared communitarian life with Newman for 32 years starting in 1843 (when St John was 28). Newman wrote after St John's death: [...] "I have ever thought no bereavement was {{equal to that}} of a husband's or a wife's, but I feel it difficult to believe that any can be greater, or any one's sorrow greater, than mine". He directed that he be buried in the same grave as St. John: [...] "I wish, with all my heart, to be buried in Fr Ambrose St John's grave– <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>give</b> this as my last, my imperative will".|$|E
