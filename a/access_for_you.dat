40|$|Objectives: In May 2008, the National Health Service (NHS) Lanarkshire (NHSL) {{implemented}} a unique telephone-based sickness absence management service entitled “EASY” (Early <b>Access</b> to Support <b>for</b> <b>You).</b> The EASY service supplements existing absence policies and enables telephone {{communication between the}} absentee, their line manager, and the EASY service {{from the first day}} of absence and referral to occupational health services at day ten. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine if the EASY service was effective between May 2008 and May 2012 in reducing sickness absence in NHSL compared to normal occupational healthcare in NHS Scotland and is, as such, a cost-saving intervention. Methods: This study included time-series analysis of health board sickness absence data and analyses of the EASY service database (survival analyses and Cox’s proportional hazards model). Results: The EASY service was effective in reducing sickness absence by 21...|$|R

40|$|According to Technorati, {{they are}} {{currently}} tracking over a 100 million blogs and close to 250 million pieces of tagged social media. This statistic is enough {{to prove that the}} internet connected world is increasingly taking to blogging in order to express their thoughts and share views on a wide array of topics. This freedom of thought and expression, considered to be a fundamental human right is not always viewed in a positive light. For example, a blog written by you is accessible to millions of other internet users. These users may include possible stalkers, sexual predators and even your employers. The views you express freely on your blog can be used against you in several ways. Sexual predators are known to search blogs for finding their potential victims. In such a scenario {{there is a need for}} the system to restrict access to your thoughts and information. But herein lies the contradiction, you want to share your views freely with people across the globe without wanting to compromise on privacy and possible malicious use. In most cases, it is difficult or rather cumbersome for the blogger to share this load of maintaining <b>access</b> control <b>for</b> his/her posts. What if the system could perform <b>access</b> control <b>for</b> <b>you</b> without compromising on your freedom of expression and privacy? That is precisely our motivating factor behind the implementation of our system i. e. Content Based Access Control. We uncover relations between entities from the blog posts, thereby allowing us to know what is being discussed where. We can then use this information in automating access control lists as well as in identifying relevant content more easily...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Sickness absence (SA) is multi-causal {{and remains}} a {{significant}} problem for employees, employers and society. This makes it necessary to concurrently manage a particular disabling condition and consider the working environment and employee-employer relationship. OBJECTIVE: To describe and examine the components of a novel SA management service Early <b>Access</b> to Support <b>for</b> <b>You</b> (EASY) and discuss their potential influence on the intervention. METHODS: A new sickness absence model, starting from day one of absence, was created called EASY. EASY is planned to support both employees and managers and comprises elements already {{found to be associated}} with reduction of SA, such as maintaining regular contact; early biopsychosocial case-management; physiotherapy; mental-health counselling; work modification; phased return-to-work; and health promotion activities. RESULTS: During the EASY implementation period, the SA rate at a health board reversed its trend of being one of the highest rates in the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) and EASY was considered helpful by both managers and employees. CONCLUSIONS: This paper describes an innovative occupational health intervention to sickness absence management based on the bio-psychosocial model to provide early intervention, and discusses {{the pros and cons of}} applying cognitive behavioural principles at an early stage in sickness-absence events, in order to improve return-to-work outcomes...|$|R
