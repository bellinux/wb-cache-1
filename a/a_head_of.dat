The Portuguese republican government granted PedroII an exhumation with dignities befitting <b>a</b> <b>Head</b> <b>of</b> State, and {{he received the}} same honors upon arrival in Brazil. The Count of Eu accompanied the remains, along with his only surviving son, Pedro de Alcântara. His wife, Princess Isabel, was elderly, unwell and unable to participate.

Mohave government consisted of a loose system of hereditary clan leaders with <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the entire nation. They were often involved in conflicts with the Chemehuevi, Paiute, and Maricopa peoples. Irataba {{was a member of}} the Mohave warrior society called kwanami, who led groups of warriors in battle and were dedicated to defending their lands and people.|$|E
5|$|Kaksparsh is a 2012 Indian Marathi period drama film {{directed}} by Mahesh Manjrekar and produced by Aniruddha Deshpande and Medha Manjrekar. The film stars Sachin Khedekar, Priya Bapat, Medha Manjrekar, Savita Malpekar and Ketaki Mategaonkar. Based {{on a short}} story by Usha Datar by the same name, the film depicts the tumultuous events in a Chitpavan Brahmin family, set around 1930–1950 in Konkan. The film was a commercial success and got critical acclaim for its direction, screenplay by Girish Joshi and also for the performances by its actors, especially Khedekar for his portrayal of Hari Damle as <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the family.|$|E

During one reception, the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him.

5|$|Pedro II may be {{considered}} a rare instance of <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> state who, despite being overwhelmingly beloved by his people, despite international admiration and acclamation, despite having been instrumental in driving forward major liberal social and economic reforms, despite overseeing a period of outstanding prosperity and influence during a reign covering nearly six decades, and despite being considered a highly successful ruler to the end, was ultimately subjected to overthrow and exile. The republican revolution which replaced the Empire led to decades of disruption and dictatorship.|$|E

5|$|The {{streets of}} Buenos Aires overflowed with huge piles of flowers. Within {{a day of}} Perón's death, all flower shops in Buenos Aires {{had run out of}} stock. Flowers would be flown in from all over the country, and as far away as Chile. Despite the fact that Eva Perón never held a {{political}} office, she was eventually given a state funeral usually reserved for <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> state, along with a full Roman Catholic requiem mass. A memorial was held for the Argentine team during the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki due to Eva Perón's death during those games.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Naimski, as <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the State Protection Office, {{started the}} process of {{screening}} people suspected of being Communist collaborators in Poland. In June that year he helped Antoni Macierewicz prepare a list of 64 members {{of the government and}} parliament who were named as spies in the police records; these included Wałęsa, then the Polish president. Wałęsa's name was included on the list after a wrenching internal debate about the virtues of honesty versus political discretion. In response to the publication of this list, President Wałęsa immediately engineered the fall of prime minister Jan Olszewski and the dismissal of Interior Minister Macierewicz. A parliamentary committee later concluded Wałęsa had not signed an agreement with the secret police.|$|E
5|$|Louise Arbour {{began her}} job as Chief Prosecutor of war crimes at the UN in October 1996. She was {{unexpectedly}} selected by her predecessor, Richard Goldstone, as he believed she processed the toughness to pursue war crime suspects and the bureaucratic and diplomatic skills to function at the UN. At the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, contrary to Goldstone's tactic of publicizing indictments, which allowed the accused to make their arrest a risk to the ceasefire, Arbour kept hers sealed allowing for surprise arrests. In Rwanda she achieved several high-profile prosecutions, including the first conviction for rape as a war crime. By time she left in Fall 1999, her office had Slobodan Milošević, <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> state, indicted and arrested.|$|E

5|$|On 15 May, Stjepan Mesić, a Croat, was {{scheduled}} to be the chairman of the rotating presidency of Yugoslavia. Serbia, aided by Kosovo, Montenegro, and Vojvodina, whose presidency votes were at that time under Serbian control, blocked the appointment, which was otherwise seen as largely ceremonial. This maneuver technically left Yugoslavia without <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> state and without a commander-in-chief. Two days later, a repeated attempt to vote on the issue failed. Ante Marković, prime minister of Yugoslavia at the time, proposed appointing a panel which would wield presidential powers. It was not immediately clear who the panel members would be, apart from defense minister Veljko Kadijević, nor who would fill position of JNA commander-in-chief. The move was quickly rejected by Croatia as unconstitutional. The crisis was resolved after a six-week stalemate, and Mesić was elected president — the first non-communist to become Yugoslav head of state in decades.|$|E
5|$|On {{his trip}} to Israel in October 1985, Weizsäcker was greeted on arrival by his Israeli counterpart, President Chaim Herzog. The {{president}} was given a full honor-guard welcome at Ben-Gurion Airport; among Cabinet ministers who lined up {{to shake his hand}} were right-wingers of the Herut party, the main faction of Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud party, who had previously refused to greet German leaders. Weizsäcker's visit was the first by <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> state, but not the first by a West German leader, as Chancellor Willy Brandt had paid a visit to Israel in June 1973. During a four-day state visit to the United Kingdom in July 1986, Weizsäcker addressed a joint session of the Houses of Parliament, the first German to be accorded that honor.|$|E
5|$|The Early English Gothic chapel of Lambeth Palace {{dates from}} work carried out while Boniface was archbishop. Boniface left England in November 1268, and never returned.

In his will, he left {{legacies}} to all the houses of the Franciscans and Dominicans in the diocese of Canterbury. His will had differing provisions for his burial depending on whether he died in England, France, or near the Alps. Oddly enough, his official seal included <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the pagan god Jupiter Serapis along with the usual depiction of the archbishop in full vestments.|$|E

5|$|The Hoare–Laval Pact of December 1935 was {{an attempt}} by the British Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare and the French Prime Minister Pierre Laval to end the {{conflict}} in Abyssinia by proposing to partition the country into an Italian sector and an Abyssinian sector. Mussolini was prepared to agree to the pact, but news of the deal leaked out. Both the British and French public vehemently protested against it, describing it as a sell-out of Abyssinia. Hoare and Laval were forced to resign, and the British and French governments dissociated themselves from the two men. In June 1936, although there was no precedent for <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> state addressing the Assembly of the League of Nations in person, Haile Selassie spoke to the Assembly, appealing for its help in protecting his country.|$|E
5|$|The Mint {{had trouble}} {{striking}} the new design. This {{was due to}} the hard copper-nickel alloy {{and the fact that the}} eagle on one side of the piece was directly opposite parts of the reverse design; efforts to bring out the design more fully led to increased die breakage. Many Flying Eagle cents show weaknesses, especially at the eagle's head and tail, which are opposite the wreath. In 1857, Snowden suggested the replacement of the eagle with <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> Christopher Columbus. Longacre replied that as there had been objections to proposals to place George Washington on the coinage, there would also be opposition to a Columbus design. Despite the difficulties, the 17,450,000 Flying Eagle cents struck at Philadelphia in 1857 constituted the greatest production of a single coin in a year at a U.S. mint to that time.|$|E
5|$|The post {{was created}} by the Treaty of Lisbon and was subject to a debate over its exact role. Prior to Lisbon, the Presidency rotated in {{accordance}} with the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The role of that President-in-Office was in no sense (other than protocol) equivalent to an office of <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> state, merely a primus inter pares (first among equals) role among other European heads of government. The President-in-Office was primarily responsible for preparing and chairing the Council meetings, and had no executive powers other than the task of representing the Union externally. Now the leader of the Council Presidency country can still act as president when the permanent president is absent.|$|E
