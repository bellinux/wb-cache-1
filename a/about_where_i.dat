5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought <b>about</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

Cheney said that the arrests made him [...] "think <b>about</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was and where I was headed. I was headed down a bad road if I continued on that course".|$|E
500|$|In {{his memoir}} , Dylan {{described}} the kinship he felt with the route that supplied {{the title of}} his sixth album: [...] "Highway 61, the main thoroughfare of the country blues, begins <b>about</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> began. I always felt like I'd started on it, always had been on it and could go anywhere, even down in to the deep Delta country. It was the same road, full of the same contradictions, the same one-horse towns, the same spiritual ancestors... It was my place in the universe, always felt like it was in my blood." ...|$|E

500|$|Forty-nine {{cars were}} entered for {{qualifying}}, but only 43 raced per NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Unlike most races during the season, the qualifying session only determined {{the first two}} positions, {{while the rest of}} the drivers qualified by the 2011 Gatorade Duels. Earnhardt clinched his 10th pole position during his career, with a time of 48.364seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Jeff Gordon. Once the qualifying session completed, Earnhardt commented, [...] "The main thing [...] does for me is take the pressure off Thursday's race. I can go out and have fun and not worry <b>about</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> finish or getting a good starting spot for the Daytona 500." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2014, Madonna {{announced}} that she had begun working on her thirteenth studio album, saying [...] "I'm {{right now in the}} process of talking to various co-writers and producers and talking <b>about</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> want to go with my music". By the next month she started posting a number of images on social media website Instagram, where she hinted at possible songwriters and collaborators with hashtag captions. Two months later, Madonna posted a selfie where she talked about working with American DJ Diplo. Madonna had invited him to her annual Oscar party, but he was unable to attend. They eventually started talking about music through texts and decided to collaborate on the album. In an interview with Idolator, Diplo explained that Madonna had asked him to provide his [...] "craziest record" [...] for the album. Together they wrote and recorded seven songs and Diplo added that [...] " [...] was up for anything. I love when an artist gives a producer the confidence he needs to work with them, and [...] was very open-minded to my ideas. Those records are gonna be crazy-sounding. We really pushed the envelope with some of the stuff we were doing." ...|$|E
500|$|By December 2013, Madonna's manager Guy Oseary {{commented that}} the singer was [...] "eager to get started" [...] on her next album. However, she had another project in mind – {{developing}} the screenplay for the Andrew Sean Greer novel, The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells. Madonna decided to split her time between writing the screenplay and writing songs for the new album. In February 2014, Madonna confirmed that she had already begun working on her thirteenth studio album, saying: [...] "I'm {{right now in the}} process of talking to various co-writers and producers and talking <b>about</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> want to go with my music". Working with a number of collaborators on the album, Madonna encountered problems in keeping a cohesive sound and creative direction for Rebel Heart, since her previous efforts had been produced with only a small core group of people developing the music. She observed that a lot of the people she enlisted would not stay in one city at a time due to their different projects, resulting in Madonna not finishing her songs. [...] "So, I was just the person standing there with a clipboard in the headlights, going 'Ok!' A little bit like a school teacher," [...] she admitted.|$|E

500|$|On 18 February 1972 {{the state}} formed the Bangladesh Women's Rehabilitation Board, which was tasked with helping {{the victims of}} rape and {{to help with the}} {{adoption}} programme. Several international agencies took part in the adoption programme, such as Mother Teresa's Sisters of Charity. The majority of the war babies were adopted in the Netherlands and Canada as the state wished to remove the reminders of Pakistan from the newly formed nation. However, not all women wanted their child taken, and some were forcibly removed and sent for adoption, a practice which was encouraged by Rahman, who said, [...] "I do not want those polluted blood in this country". While many women were glad for the abortion programme, as {{they did not have to}} bear a child conceived of rape, others had to go full term, filled with hatred towards the child they carried. Others, who had their children adopted out so as to return to [...] "mainstream life", would not look at their newborn as it was taken from them. In the 1990s many of these children returned to Bangladesh to search for their birth mothers. In 2008, D'Costa attempted to find those who had been adopted, however very few responded, one who did said [...] "I hated being a kid, and I am angry at Bangladesh for not taking care of me when I needed it most. I don’t have any roots and that makes me cry. So that is why I am trying to learn more <b>about</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was born." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ciara's fifth {{album was}} {{originally}} called One Woman Army after {{a song of}} the same name produced by The Underdogs. Speaking on the concept Ciara said [...] "It really {{is the best way to}} represent what the body of work is, On One Woman Army, I talk <b>about</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am and the things that I want as a woman and the things that I need." [...] However, on April 15, 2013, Ciara confirmed the album's track listing and simultaneously revealed that her fifth album was now eponymously titled. According to Spin, the self-titled incarnation of Ciara's fifth studio album is [...] "more inventive enough to separate itself from her previous work" [...] compared to the album's previous direction, under the title One Woman Army.|$|E

2500|$|The lyrical {{themes of}} Currents centre on {{personal}} transition and growing older. Parker's lyrics {{on the album}} are entirely autobiographical. His vocals are clearer and less affected than in prior Tame Impala releases, which is partially owed to him having more pride in his lyrics; he said he {{hoped it would be}} easy for listeners to understand them. Parker considered the primary theme of the album to be a [...] "deep feeling of transition in your psyche," [...] or, in a broad sense, fully entering adulthood. He began learning about the concept of the Saturn return halfway through the recording process, which explained his feelings of reflection. He said, [...] "I was halfway through making the album when I heard about it, and it gave what I was doing a lot more meaning; suddenly things made a lot more sense." [...] Accordingly, on the album his reaction to transition is acceptance, exemplified by the opening song, [...] "Let It Happen". Parker also felt buying the home where he recorded Currents [...] "really changed my perspective <b>about</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> saw myself, like a place that I belonged." ...|$|E

5000|$|Although Gangrene {{takes the}} form of a novel, the style is {{deliberately}} journalistic in nature: “They call me an author,” Geeraerts once said, “but primarily I am a journalist.

His writings have also been described as being “therapeutic”.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2002 Kevin {{reflected}} on his song writing [...] "It didn't bother {{me that people}} didn't {{pick up on the}} lyrics. I'd made a conscious effort to focus on lyrics, because there were some lyrics on Slightly Odway that I was a little embarrassed <b>about,</b> ones <b>where</b> <b>I</b> hadn't really been trying.

5000|$|French {{composer}} and pianist Michel Legrand's [...] "The Summer Knows", {{the theme from}} the 1971 film Summer of '42, served as the musical inspiration for Rich's song. He was quoted by Billboard author Tom Roland as saying: [...] "I don't think I stole from them all sic, but that's my favorite theme of all time. There's not a similarity, and yet, you can understand what I was thinking <b>about</b> and <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was coming from." ...|$|R

They were very kind to me, and I was included in their discussions <b>about</b> painting, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> listened open-mouthed but carefully to everything they said.

60|$|Round <b>about</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> live, for instance, two {{changes are}} taking place which really affect the land and all things that live on it, whether for good or evil. The first is that the urban {{civilisation}} (or whatever it is) is advancing; that the clerks come out in black swarms and the villas advance in red battalions. The other is that the vast estates into which England has long been divided are passing {{out of the hands}} of the English gentry into the hands of men who are always upstarts and often actually foreigners.|$|E
