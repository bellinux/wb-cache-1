25|$|The {{vertices}} of any graph may {{always be}} ordered {{in such a}} way that the greedy algorithm produces an optimal coloring. For, given any optimal coloring in which the smallest color set is maximal, the second color set is maximal with respect to the first color set, etc., one may order the vertices by their colors. Then when one uses a greedy algorithm with this order, the resulting coloring is automatically optimal. More strongly, perfectly orderable graphs (which include chordal graphs, comparability graphs, and distance-hereditary graphs) have an ordering that is optimal both for the graph itself <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> its induced subgraphs. However, finding an optimal ordering for an arbitrary graph is NP-hard (because it could be used to solve the NP-complete graph coloring problem), and recognizing perfectly orderable graphs is also NP-complete. For this reason, heuristics have been used that attempt to reduce the number of colors while not guaranteeing an optimal number of colors.|$|E

2500|$|The MSSM imposes R-parity {{to explain}} the {{stability}} of the proton. [...] It adds supersymmetry breaking by introducing explicit soft supersymmetry breaking operators into the Lagrangian that is communicated to it by some unknown (and unspecified) dynamics. This means that there are 120 new parameters in the MSSM. [...] Most of these parameters lead to unacceptable phenomenology such as large flavor changing neutral currents or large electric dipole moments for the neutron and electron. [...] To avoid these problems, the MSSM takes all of the soft supersymmetry breaking to be diagonal in flavor space <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the new CP violating phases to vanish.|$|E

They received national attention, including in several notable pieces in The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, Time magazine, Rolling Stone, Blender, and Spin, many of which proclaimed Conor Oberst to be a significant new artist. The album was a commercial success and has sold over 250,000 copies, a breakthrough for the label <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the band's peers at that time. Oberst stated that, before making this record, both he and Mike Mogis had an idea for a [...] "sort of grandiose sound" [...] that neither could really put into words.

2500|$|A trenchant {{point of}} view on the matter is {{expressed}} by G. Călinescu. Poor Dionis, he writes, is merely [...] "a fantasy novella à la Théophile Gautier", <b>and,</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> Eminescu's intertextual clues, the reification of Kantian concepts cannot function. According to G. Călinescu's verdicts, Kant did not view time as subjective, but rather as a subject of physical phenomena—Eminescu's interpretation comes from Kantian critics like Arthur Schopenhauer and J. Fichte. Whether Poor Dionis is Kantian or Schopenhauerian has been the topic of dispute among other critics—according to philosopher Angela Botez, this is mainly because Schopenhauer, who fascinated young Eminescu, borrowed and revolutionized some of the core Kantian ideas. [...] "In truth", she notes, [...] "from the philosophical musings that introduce the novella, and down to Dionis' metempsychosis, all this chaotic story is a powerful echo of Schopenhauerian philosophical categories." [...] Shortly after Poor Dionis, Eminescu penned a dialogue, Archaeus, which ridiculed Kant's transcendental idealism, suggesting that even a gander could be better trusted to understand the world. According to Perpessicius, this piece is [...] "tied to Poor Dionis by direct threads".|$|E
2500|$|The Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry in 1946 was a joint {{attempt by}} Britain and the United States {{to agree on}} a policy {{regarding}} the admission of Jews to Palestine. In April, the Committee reported that its members had arrived at a unanimous decision. The Committee approved the American recommendation of the immediate acceptance of 100,000 Jewish refugees from Europe into Palestine. It also recommended that there be no Arab, and no Jewish State. The Committee stated that [...] "in order to dispose, once <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>all,</b> <b>of</b> the exclusive claims of Jews and Arabs to Palestine, we regard it as essential that a clear statement of principle should be made that Jew shall not dominate Arab and Arab shall not dominate Jew in Palestine." [...] U.S. President Harry S Truman angered the British Government by issuing a statement supporting the 100,000 refugees but refusing to acknowledge the rest of the committee's findings. Britain had asked for U.S assistance in implementing the recommendations. The U.S. War Department had said earlier that to assist Britain in maintaining order against an Arab revolt, an open-ended U.S. commitment of 300,000 troops would be necessary. The immediate admission of 100,000 new Jewish immigrants would almost certainly have provoked an Arab uprising.|$|E

2500|$|Bullough {{argues that}} {{prostitution}} in 18th-century Britain was a convenience to men of all social statuses, and economic necessity for many poor women, and was tolerated by society. [...] The evangelical {{movement of the}} nineteenth century denounced the prostitutes and their clients as sinners, and denounced society for tolerating it. Prostitution, according to the values of the Victorian middle-class, was a horrible evil, for the young women, for the men, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> society. [...] Parliament in the 1860s in the Contagious Diseases Acts ("CD") adopted the French system of licensed prostitution. The [...] "regulationist policy" [...] was to isolate, segregate, and control prostitution. The main goal was to protect working men, soldiers and sailors near ports and army bases from catching venereal disease. Young women officially became prostitutes and were [...] trapped for life in the system. After a nationwide crusade led by Josephine Butler and the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts, Parliament repealed the acts and ended legalised prostitution. Butler became a sort of saviour to the girls she helped free. [...] The age of consent for young women was raised from 12 to 16, undercutting the supply of young prostitutes who were in highest demand. [...] The new moral code meant that respectable men dared not be caught.|$|E
