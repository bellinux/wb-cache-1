Then we perform an heuristic analysis of the dynamical behavior of the map using the invariant function for the normalized map.

With large errors confined to small regions, an adaptive technique can successfully improve accuracy.

40|$|Abstract. Error {{estimates}} for the Crank-Nicolson in time, Finite Element in space (CNFE) discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations require application of the discrete Gronwall inequality, {{which leads to a}} time-step (∆t) restriction. All known convergence analyses of the fully discrete CNFE with linear extrapolation rely on a similar ∆t-restriction. We show that CNFE with arbitrary-orderextrapolation (denoted CNLE) is convergences optimally in the energy norm without any ∆t-restriction. We prove that CNLE velocity and corresponding discrete time-derivative converge optimally in l ∞ (H 1) and l 2 (L 2) respectively under the mild condition ∆t ≤ Mh 1 / 4 for any arbitrary M> 0 (e. g. independent of problem data, h, and ∆t) where h> 0 is the maximum mesh element diameter. Convergence in these higher order norms is needed to prove convergence {{estimates for}} pressure and the drag/lift force a fluid exerts on an obstacle. Our analysis exploits the extrapolated convective velocity to avoid any ∆t-restriction for convergence in the energy norm. However, the coupling between the extrapolated convecting velocity of usual CNLE and the <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> <b>control</b> of average velocities (characteristic of CN methods) rather than pointwise velocities (e. g. backward-Euler methods) in l 2 (H 1) is precisely the source of ∆t-restriction for convergence in higher-order norms...|$|E

Their development will completely transform the organisation of our healthcare system, profoundly change the way patients are managed and revolutionizes disease prevention. Main body: The CHD with healthcare applications is a tidal wave that has societal impact calling into question the privacy of patients' personal and healthcare information and its protection in secure systems. Rather than {{trying to stop the}} use of CHD, we must channel the wave by clearly examining the advantages versus the risks and threats to the patients, and find counter-measures for implementation. The main difficulty is channeling the wave {{in a way that is}} acceptable to CHD developers who otherwise will bypass the rules, even if they can be sued for it. Therefore, it appears necessary to implement guidelines that can be used by all developers, defining the minimum requirement for assuring the security of patient privacy and healthcare management.

40|$|Abstract: The {{investment}} procedure prescribes {{the stages}} and tests through which all investment projects must pass before being accepted or not. It governs {{the conditions of}} acceptability and constitutes a powerful device of <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> <b>control.</b> In this paper, we intend to understand how investment procedures enable grand ideals regarding investment to be institutionalised. In particular, {{over and above the}} assumed effectiveness and rationale of these procedures, we identify the mechanisms through which these procedures construct social roles. In this respect, this research goes beyond the procedures ’ technical functions and focuses on the very form of procedures. Indeed, the form of a procedure presents two features: it is written, generally consigned to a “manual”; and it relies on “cognitive artefacts ” (Norman, 1991) or “technologies of the intellect ” (Goody, 1977) such as lists, tables and formulae like Discounted Cash Flow. This paper shows how this specific form takes effect during the process of institutionalisation, through which grand investment ideals (e. g. competitiveness, value creation) are transformed into concrete devices and into roles (Miller, 1991). Thanks to an enquiry conducted in 2003 and 2004, investment procedures in six large companies in a French context are analysed. It is argued that (1) the formalisation of the objectives of the procedures, as well as the definitions of investment through typologies shape the actors ’ boundaries of action; (2) valuation methods based on the domination of economic-mathematical formula favour short-term over long-term reflection; (3) the setting of decision-making threshold...|$|E

40|$|The False Discovery Rate (FDR) {{is a new}} {{statistical}} procedure to control the number of mistakes made when performing multiple hypothesis tests, i. e. when comparing many data against a given model hypothesis. The key advantage of FDR {{is that it allows}} one to <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> <b>control</b> the average fraction of false rejections made (when comparing to the null hypothesis) over the total number of rejections performed. We compare FDR to the standard procedure of rejecting all tests that do not match the null hypothesis above some arbitrarily chosen confidence limit, e. g. 2 sigma, or at the 95 % confidence level. When using FDR, we find a similar rate of correct detections, but with significantly fewer false detections. Moreover, the FDR procedure is quick and easy to compute and can be trivially adapted to work with correlated data. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to introduce the FDR procedure to the astrophysics community. We illustrate the power of FDR through several astronomical examples, including the detection of features against a smooth one-dimensional function, e. g. seeing the ``baryon wiggles'' in a power spectrum of matter fluctuations, and source pixel detection in imaging data. In this era of large datasets and high precision measurements, FDR provides the means to adaptively control a scientifically meaningful quantity [...] the number of false discoveries made when conducting multiple hypothesis tests.

40|$|Abstract Background Several {{bacterial}} species possess chelation {{mechanisms that}} allow them to scavenge iron from the environment under conditions of limitation. To this end they produce siderophores that bind the iron and make it available to the cells later on, while rendering it unavailable to other organisms. The phenomenon of siderophore mediated antagonism has been studied to some extent for suspended populations where {{it was found that the}} chelation ability provides a growth advantage over species that do not have this possibility. However, most bacteria live in biofilm communities. In particular Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas putida, the species that have been used in most experimental studies of the phenomenon, are known to be prolific biofilm formers, but only very few experimental studies of iron chelation have been published to date for the biofilm setting. We address this question in the present study. Methods Based on a previously introduced model of iron chelation and an existing model of biofilm growth we formulate a model for iron chelation and competition in dual species biofilms. This leads to a highly nonlinear system of partial differential equations which is studied in computer simulation experiments. Conclusions (i) Siderophore production can give a growth advantage also in the biofilm setting, (ii) diffusion facilitates and emphasizes this growth advantage, (iii) the magnitude of the growth advantage can also depend on the initial inoculation of the substratum, (iv) a new mass transfer boundary condition was derived that allows to <b>a</b> <b>priori</b> <b>control</b> the expect the expected average thickness of the biofilm in terms of the model parameters. </p...|$|E
