50|$|Butanone {{can react}} with most {{oxidizing}} materials, and can produce fires. It is moderately explosive; it requires {{only a small}} flame or spark to cause a vigorous reaction. Butanone fires should be extinguished with carbon dioxide, dry agents, or <b>alcohol-resistant</b> <b>foam.</b> Concentrations in the air high enough to be flammable are intolerable to humans due to the irritating nature of the vapor.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, National Foam, Inc. invented Alcohol-Resistant AFFF technology. AR-AFFF is a {{synthetic}} foam developed for both hydrocarbon and polar-solvent materials. Polar solvents are combustible liquids that destroy conventional fire-fighting foam. These solvents extract the water {{contained in the}} foam, breaking down the foam blanket. Hence, these fuels require an alcohol- or polar-solvent-resistant foam. <b>Alcohol-resistant</b> <b>foam</b> must be bounced off of a surface and allowed to flow down and over the liquid to form its membrane, compared to standard AFFF that can be sprayed directly onto the fire.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Alcohol-resistant</b> <b>foams</b> {{contain a}} polymer that forms a {{protective}} layer between the burning {{surface and the}} foam, preventing foam breakdown by alcohols in the burning fuel. <b>Alcohol-resistant</b> <b>foams</b> are used in fighting fires of fuels containing oxygenates, e.g. MTBE, or fires of liquids based on or containing polar solvents.|$|R
50|$|Protein foams include regular protein foam(P), fluoroprotein foam(FP), {{film-forming}} fluoroprotein(FFFP), <b>alcohol-resistant</b> fluoroprotein <b>foam</b> (AR-FP), and <b>alcohol-resistant</b> film-forming fluoroprotein (AR-FFFP).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Alcohol-resistant</b> aqueous {{film-forming}} <b>foams</b> (AR-AFFF) are foams {{resistant to}} the action of alcohols and can form a protective film.|$|R
25|$|<b>Alcohol-resistant</b> aqueous {{film-forming}} <b>foams</b> (AR-AFFF), used on fuel fires containing alcohol. Forms a membrane {{between the}} fuel and the foam preventing the alcohol from {{breaking down the}} foam blanket.|$|R
