40|$|We generalize {{the field}} theory of global {{monopole}} to Dirac-Born-Infeld(DBI) field and investigate the gravitational property of <b>a</b> DBI <b>global</b> monopole in four-dimensional spherically symmetric spacetime. The coupled equations for the metric and the DBI scalar field are solved asymptotically and numerically. It is found that, just as <b>a</b> canonical <b>global</b> monopole, the gravitational effect of DBI global monopole {{is equivalent to}} that of a deficit solid angle in the metric plus a negative mass at the origin. However, compared with <b>a</b> canonical <b>global</b> monopole, for the same false vacuum and symmetry breaking scale, <b>a</b> DBI <b>global</b> monopole has <b>a</b> relatively smaller core and a larger absolute value of effective mass. Thus, it can give out a larger deflect angle when the light passing by. Especially, when the scale of warp factor is small enough, the effective mass of <b>a</b> DBI <b>global</b> monopole does not depend apparently on the value of the false vacuum, which is qualitatively different from that of <b>a</b> canonical <b>global</b> monopole.
