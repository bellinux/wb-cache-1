5|$|According to the {{official}} record (read by Thomas Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury, during an assembly of lords and commons at Westminster Hall on Tuesday 30 September), Richard gave up his crown willingly and ratified his deposition citing as a reason his own unworthiness as a monarch. On the other hand, the Traison et Mort Chronicle suggests otherwise. It describes a meeting between Richard and Henry that took place one day before the parliament's session. The king succumbed to blind rage, ordered his release from the Tower, called his cousin a traitor, demanded to see his wife and swore revenge throwing down his bonnet, while the duke refused to do <b>anything</b> <b>without</b> parliamentary approval.|$|E

Graves's campaign collected over a thousand signatures in support, but was vigorously attacked by the British Road Federation, who derided the apparent evidence of public support for the scheme as [...] "sending a lot of students around to council flats [...] most people will sign <b>anything</b> <b>without</b> knowing what it is all about". A public enquiry of 1974 recommended that the bridge remain open to avoid congestion on neighbouring bridges, and it remained open to traffic with the tidal flow and 2-ton weight limit in place.|$|E

500|$|Paul Raibourn {{served as}} the {{president}} of Paramount Television Productions. Raibourn was also appointed vice president of Paramount Pictures Corporation, and, due to Paramount's minority interest in DuMont, was installed as treasurer of the DuMont Television Network. This appointment created another point of conflict between Paramount and DuMont. According to Leonard Goldenson, president of ABC during this era, Raibourn [...] "constantly nitpicked and needled [...] over the smallest expenditures. DuMont came to the point where, psychologically, he thought he couldn't do <b>anything</b> <b>without</b> Raibourn's approval." [...] Raibourn trimmed DuMont's budgets {{at a time when the}} network should have been expanding. Goldenson credits Raibourn as one of the reasons ABC eventually became a successful, established television network while the DuMont network failed: [...] "the name of the television game is programs.

500|$|Like all intellectuals of his age, Matthias was {{convinced}} that the movements and combinations of the stars and planets exercised influence on individuals' life and on the history of nations. Galeotto Marzio described him as [...] "king and astrologer", and Antonio Bonfini said Matthias [...] "never did <b>anything</b> <b>without</b> consulting the stars". Upon his request, the famous astronomers of the age, Johannes Regiomontanus and Marcin Bylica, set up an observatory in Buda and installed it with astrolabes and celestial globes. Regiomontanus dedicated his book on navigation that was used by Christopher Columbus to Matthias. The King appointed Bylica as his advisor in 1468. According to Scott E. Hendrix, [...] "establishing a prominent astrologer as his political advisor provided an anxiety-reduction mechanism that boosted morale for the political elites within his realm while strengthening his sense of control {{in the face of the}} multiple adversities the Hungarians faced" [...] in his reign.|$|E
500|$|Edward Lycett Green, {{described}} by Havers, Grayson and Shankland as [...] "the emotional {{force behind the}} accusations", was next in the witness box. Although Lycett Green had not played on the first night, Clarke considered him a potentially dangerous witness who was capable of giving vital evidence. Lycett Green stated {{that he had seen}} Gordon-Cumming twice push counters over the chalk line when he should not have done so; he had considered accusing Gordon-Cumming at the time, but decided against it because he [...] "did not like to make a scene before ladies". At points in the examination by Asquith, Lycett Green contradicted the course of events outlined by Stanley Wilson—which Levett had also done—and on one point regarding a question the prince put to Levett; his answer was [...] "highly suspect". Havers, Grayson and Shankland later wrote that [...] "it is remarkable that he, the prime mover in the affair, seemed unable to say <b>anything</b> <b>without</b> qualifying it with some such remark as, 'I don't exactly remember'... The hedging by the principal accuser certainly weakens the defendants' case". They also thought that [...] "is refusal to remember anything was obviously humbug, a deliberate policy".|$|E

The following day, the song premiered on Fantasia’s Vevo channel, and explicit and clean versions were digitally released at the iTunes Store. It was Fantasia's first release after joining Primary Wave Music. According to the singer, [...] "No Time for It" [...] was chosen by her label as the album's first single. She was initially hesitant about releasing the song ("At first I was thinking, 'Is that a record to come back with?), but she later said that it [...] "set the atmosphere" [...] for her future singles. Fantasia was critical of the single, describing it as a [...] "very cute record", but felt connected to its message. She had favored [...] "Sleeping with the One I Love" [...] (2016) as the album's lead single. According to the singer, she would not record <b>anything</b> <b>without</b> feeling a personal connection and the album's recording process was all about [...] "artistic fulfillment". Jourdan Miller of BreatheHeavy called the single's release [...] "perfectly timed seeing how the singing reality competition {{is on its way}} out, cause we all have no time for it".|$|E
500|$|Remek (then a Captain) {{joined the}} Intercosmos program in 1976; his backup was Oldřich Pelčák, the other Czechoslovak {{cosmonaut}} selected to participate with the program. During the flight, Remek experimented with the Kristall furnace {{on board the}} capsule. The mission, coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the Soviet-backed 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état, and including Remek, {{the son of a}} Czech mother and Slovak father, had propaganda value in stressing Czechoslovak-Soviet cooperation. Remek himself has not denied this although he retains pride in his voyage regardless of the circumstances. He became the first cosmonaut from a country other than the Soviet Union or the United States, and [...] with the entry of the Czech Republic into the European Union, Remek is considered to be the first astronaut from the European Union. After Remek's March 1978 flight, he was celebrated in his home country with a series of receptions at factories and other civil workplaces. He was also recognized at a ceremony at Prague Castle as a guest of Gustáv Husák, then the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. On 16 March, Remek and Aleksei Gubarev, the other member of the crew, were awarded the medal Hero of the Soviet Union. Czechoslovak reaction to Remek's flight included comments about the media's inundation focused on Remek {{and the fact that he}} was only able to journey with a Soviet cosmonaut as if Remek needed a minder. One joke went: [...] "Why didn't the Soviets send up two Czechoslovak cosmonauts? Because they would've landed in West Germany." [...] Remek himself joked that his Soviet counterpart would slap Remek's hands off of controls if he touched <b>anything</b> <b>without</b> permission. French astronaut Jean-Loup Chrétien experienced this same behavior onboard Soyuz TM-7 in 1988.|$|E
500|$|In January 2015, Disney officially {{began the}} film's {{marketing}} campaign by releasing a miniature [...] "ant-sized" [...] teaser trailer, a full-sized {{version of the}} same teaser trailer, a poster, a cover on Entertainment Weekly, and a full-length trailer during the premiere of the television series Agent Carter. Scott Mendelson of Forbes, said, [...] "It was darn-clever for Disney to put out a miniature 'can't see <b>anything</b> <b>without</b> a microscope' version of the now-standard trailer for the trailer. I sighed just a little when they 'gave in' and released a human-sized version, realizing that Disney had just released what amounted to a teaser to a teaser to a trailer... But nonetheless, credit where credit is due, Disney was able to turn a single theatrical trailer into three separate news drops in about five days." [...] Mendelson {{went on to say that}} [...] "the peppy, witty trailer above is a general audience sell. Marvel knows the geeks will come if only to throw stones, but it's the mainstream audience that needs to be sold. So far, so good." [...] However, Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the trailer for its placement during the broadcast premiere of Agent Carter, its tone, its soundtrack, and for being thematically similar to other trailers from Marvel Studios. McMillan concluded, [...] "The Ant-Man trailer isn't bad, per se; it is, however, impressively underwhelming, which almost seems worse. Thanks to the last-minute exit of original writer-director Edgar Wright and the subsequent struggle to find a replacement, Ant-Man has become the movie that people are expecting to be Marvel's first failure, in critical if not financial terms, at least; this trailer, which fails to convince and gets by on goodwill for those involved and the Marvel brand as much as anything else, doesn't do enough — or anything, really — to persuade audiences that that's not the case." [...] The trailer generated 29 million views worldwide in three days, the third-largest viewership for a Marvel Studios film, behind trailers for Iron Man 3 and Avengers: Age of Ultron.|$|E

The government can also arbitrarily detain anyone it desires theoretically for sixty days, but in reality for an undetermined length of time, under the Internal Security Act (ISA). In 1987 under Operation Lalang (literally [...] "weeding operation"), several leaders of the DAP, including Lim Kit Siang and Karpal Singh, were held under the ISA. It is widely believed this was due to their calling for the NEP and other Malay privileges to be reviewed. Others have questioned the constitutionality of the NEP.|$|E

2500|$|Denison {{continues}} his work, tapping into a third parallel universe {{that is in}} a pre-big bang state (called 'cosmic egg' or 'cosmeg'), where physical laws are totally opposite to those of Dua's universe. [...] Matter from the cosmeg starts with very weak nuclear force, and then spontaneously fuses as our universe's physical laws take over. [...] The exchange with the second parallel universe both produces more energy at little or no cost, and balances the changes resulting of the Electron Pump, resulting in a return to equilibrium. [...] However Selene clandestinely conducts another test showing that momentum can also be exchanged with the cosmeg. [...] Denison catches her and forces her to admit her secret purpose: Neville thinks the momentum exchange {{can be used to}} move <b>anything</b> <b>without</b> using rockets, including the Moon itself.
