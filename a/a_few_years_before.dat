5|$|Alexander fled Macedon {{with his}} mother, {{dropping}} her {{off with her}} brother, King Alexander I of Epirus in Dodona, capital of the Molossians. He continued to Illyria, where he sought refuge with the Illyrian king and {{was treated as a}} guest, despite having defeated them in battle <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>before.</b> However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend, Demaratus, who mediated between the two parties.|$|E

Accompanied by his grandson, the journey took four days by train before the pair {{arrived in the}} Perth suburb of Applecross, where Howell was {{to live with his}} married daughter, Norma. He later moved to Gunyidi, via Watheroo, where he was to reside for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> returning to Perth.

5|$|McNary's father helped on {{the family}} farm, then taught school for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> {{returning}} to farming near Salem. When McNary's mother died in 1878, his father moved the family to Salem where he bought a general merchandise store after being unable to run the family farm because of declining health. Charles, known as Tot, began his education at a one-room school in Keizer and later attended Central School in Salem, living on North Commercial Street. Hugh McNary died in 1883, making Charlie an orphan {{at the age of}} nine.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{constructed}} by George Mills {{under the direction}} of Richard Worsley, the Captain of the Island, on land belonging to the Crown, possibly on the site of a church destroyed during the events of 1543. Henry had dissolved the monasteries in England <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>before,</b> and stone from the local Quarr Abbey was probably reused {{in the construction of the}} castle. It was finished by 1547, when Mills was paid £1,000 for his work and to discharge the soldiers who had been guarding the site during the project.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{the orbits}} of the Haumean moons appear almost exactly edge-on from Earth, with Namaka having {{periodically}} occulted Haumea from 2009 to 2011. Observation of such transits would provide precise information on {{the size and shape}} of Haumea and its moons, as happened in the late 1980s with Pluto and Charon. The tiny change in brightness of the system during these occultations required at least a medium-aperture professional telescope for detection. Hiʻiaka last occulted Haumea in 1999, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> its discovery, and will not do so again for some 130 years. However, in a situation unique among regular satellites, the great torquing of Namaka's orbit by Hiʻiaka preserved the viewing angle of Namaka–Haumea transits for several more years.|$|E

5|$|Biden's {{father had}} been very well-off earlier in his life, but {{suffered}} several business reversals {{by the time his}} son was born. For several years, the family had to live with Biden's maternal grandparents, the Finnegans. When the Scranton area went into economic decline during the 1950s, Biden's father could not find enough work. In 1953, the Biden family moved to an apartment in Claymont, Delaware, where they lived for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> moving to a house in Wilmington, Delaware. Joe Biden Sr. was then more successful as a used car salesman, and the family's circumstances were middle class.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century, Bath's abbey {{church was}} {{dilapidated}} and Oliver King, Bishop of Bath and Wells, decided to rebuild it {{on a smaller}} scale in 1500. The new church was completed just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> Bath Priory was dissolved in 1539 by Henry VIII. The abbey church became derelict before being restored as the city's parish church in the Elizabethan era, when the city experienced a revival as a spa. The baths were improved and the city began to attract the aristocracy. A Royal charter granted by Queen Elizabeth I in 1590 confirmed city status.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1880s, their engines were {{becoming}} worn out {{and most of}} the ships were placed into reserve for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> being sold for breaking up. The machinery of Avon, Dwarf and Elk was in good enough shape that they were assigned as tenders to the coastguard district ships at Hull, Southampton, and Liverpool for a number of years. Midge was also an exception and was retained in Chinese waters until 1907 when she was sold at Hong Kong. Elk lasted nearly as long in harbour service as she was reclassified as a tugboat in 1890 and was then sold as a dredger in 1905.|$|E

5|$|Commissioned only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> the {{outbreak}} of World War I, the ships had limited service careers. All three of the battleships conducted training cruises in the Mediterranean Sea in 1912. In 1913, they took part in an international naval demonstration in the Ionian Sea that protested the Balkan Wars. After Italy declared war on Austro-Hungary and the other Central Powers in 1915, the three Radetzky-class ships bombarded coastal targets in the Adriatic Sea. After 1915, {{their participation in the}} war became minimal. All three ships were handed over to Italy {{after the end of the}} war, and broken up for scrap between 1920 and 1926.|$|E
5|$|From 1929 until 1960, {{the road}} {{was part of the}} state highway system as M-135. The {{northern}} end of the highway always contained a section that ran concurrently with M-98, another state highway in the area. For a period in the 1950s, M-135 had a different northern terminus separate from M-98's endpoint. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> both highways were removed from the highway system, M-135 was moved to use M-98's terminus with M-28. Since the 1970s, M-135 {{has been a part of}} the county-designated highway system and assigned the number H-33, a moniker it has borne since.|$|E
5|$|Hurst was {{equipped}} with new heavy, RML guns in heavily protected casemated positions. These weapons were slow to reload, so {{to ensure that the}} castle would {{have a good chance of}} hitting enemy ships passing at speed, two long batteries of weapons were built onto either side of the old castle, a west wing with 37 gun positions and an east wing with 24 positions. These were built on top of the two gun batteries constructed there <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> and also required the castle's moat to be filled in. As work progressed, the decision was taken to reinforce the batteries with additional iron shields.|$|E

5|$|If {{the church}} from the {{marginal}} note is equated with the Round Church, {{then it can}} be conclusively dated {{to no more than}} <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> 907. While the church can be ascribed to no later than the 10th century, some scholars have suggested that it may have been constructed directly on top of a much earlier late Roman basilica due to its antiquated plan. A possible donor (ktetor) of {{at least part of the}} church's construction is a high-ranking church official (chartophylax) named Paul, who is mentioned in an inscription inside the church. The main part of the work was likely funded by Simeon, who may have acted as a chief sponsor.|$|E
5|$|In 1849, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> {{his death}} in 1852, Mantell {{realised}} that iguanodonts were not heavy, pachyderm-like animals, as Owen was putting forward, but had slender forelimbs; however, his passing left him unable {{to participate in the}} creation of the Crystal Palace dinosaur sculptures, and so Owen's vision of the dinosaurs became that seen by the public for decades. With Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins, he had nearly two dozen lifesize sculptures of various prehistoric animals built out of concrete sculpted over a steel and brick framework; two iguanodonts (based on the Mantellodon specimen), one standing and one resting on its belly, were included. Before the sculpture of the standing iguanodont was completed, he held a banquet for twenty inside it.|$|E

Chappuis appeared {{on the cover of the}} October 28, 1947 issue of Look magazine which featured pictures of him on the football field and at the fraternity house. In the magazine, Chappuis and his future wife were also featured about the Michigan campus.

50|$|This chapel was not well-maintained, {{and it was}} {{not used}} regularly, which {{resulted}} in it being profaned by Bishop Miguel Juan Balaguer Camarasa on 25 March 1659, and again by Lorenzo D'Astiria in 1666.

5|$|Smith's net worth, {{including}} {{real estate}} and stocks and bonds, was $3,250,000, and as he had no will his estate was divided equally among his mother, brother, nephew (James McGill) and niece (Eleanor Ewing). William Smith and James McGill later moved to Indianapolis in 1913 after purchasing the Indianapolis Baseball Club for $150,000. George Smith, the 1916 Kentucky Derby winner, was named after Pittsburgh Phil because he had once owned the colt's dam, Consuelo II. His racing Maxims, gleaned from his only interview with Edward Cole <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> his death, are still considered valid by modern handicappers.|$|E
5|$|The {{captured}} frigates were valuable prizes but the Royal Navy only acquired Medée, {{which it}} took into service as HMS Medee, which it never commissioned but instead {{used as a}} prison ship for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> selling her in 1805. The frigates had come into port shortly before the Peace of Amiens and thus were deemed surplus to Navy requirements. The ships and their stores and equipment were sold privately; the proceeds from the sale were paid as prize money in February 1803. The British crews also benefited from head-money, a financial award for each French sailor captured during the engagement.|$|E
5|$|A {{civil war}} between Stephen and the Empress Matilda soon broke out and Gilbert took his chance to rise up against Stephen, seizing Ludlow Castle. Stephen responded by taking an army into the Welsh Marches, where he {{attempted}} to garner local support by marrying one of his knights, Joce de Dinan, to Sybil and granting the future ownership of the castle to them. Stephen took the castle after several attempts in 1139, famously rescuing his ally Prince Henry of Scotland when the latter was caught on a hook thrown over the walls by the garrison. Gilbert still maintained {{that he was the}} rightful owner of Ludlow, however, and a private war ensued between Joce and himself. Gilbert was ultimately successful and retook the castle around <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> {{the end of the civil}} war in 1153. He ultimately left for the Levant, leaving Ludlow in the hands of firstly, his eldest son, Robert, and then, after Robert's death, his younger son, Hugh de Lacy.|$|E
