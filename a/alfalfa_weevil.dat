The State Entomologist, Lawrence Bruner, offered Smith a position as assistant. It was there that Smith met and later married Bruner's daughter, Psyche. Following Smith's graduation from the University of Nebraska in 1908, he was hired by Leland Ossian Howard to work at the USDA's Bureau of Entomology. During this time Smith held several assignments including the Boll Weevil Eradication Program, the Gypsy Moth Parasite Laboratory in Melrose Highlands, Massachusetts, and a 1912 collaboration in Italy with Filippo Silvestri to identify a natural predator to the <b>alfalfa</b> <b>weevil.</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>alfalfa</b> <b>weevil</b> {{grows to}} {{a length of}} about 4 to 5.5 mm. The rostrum or beak is short and broad. The frons is half {{as wide as the}} rostrum while the pronotum is {{broadest}} in the centre. The general colour of the insect is brown, with a dark mid-dorsal stripe. The larva has a distinctive black head and no legs; it is yellowish-green, with a white dorsal stripe and faint white lateral stripes. It is about 1 cm long just before pupation. It pupates in a white, pea-sized cocoon made of loosely-woven silk. It resembles the clover leaf weevil (Hypera punctata), but that species is nearly twice as large, the larvae have tan heads and they seldom cause much damage to alfalfa crops.|$|E
40|$|The <b>alfalfa</b> <b>weevil,</b> Hypera postica (Gyllenhal), {{was first}} {{found in the}} United States in Salt Lake City, Utah, during 1904 (Titus, 1910 b). It spread form this point of {{original}} introduction and partially infested Cache Valley by 1912 (Titus, 1913). The <b>alfalfa</b> <b>weevil</b> {{has become one of}} the more important insect problems currently affecting American agriculture. Recently, this problem has attracted national attention because of the development of resistance to insecticides by the <b>alfalfa</b> <b>weevil,</b> the outlawing of certain pesticides for use on forage crops and the rapid spread of the <b>alfalfa</b> <b>weevil</b> to new areas. With this increased attention, many discrepancies have appeared in different reports of the <b>alfalfa</b> <b>weevil</b> 2 ̆ 7 s biology. The results of studies in the eastern United States often do not agree with those of studies which were made in Utah and vicinity during the early part of this century. In order to investigate the discrepancies or differences, and to determine the behavior patterns of the <b>alfalfa</b> <b>weevil</b> in Cache Valley, this study was undertaken. It was conducted from June, 1965 to August, 1966. The main topics investigated were the adult <b>alfalfa</b> <b>weevil</b> 2 ̆ 7 s flight activities, reproduction, daily field activities, seasonal history including diapause, and respiration under controlled conditions...|$|E
40|$|The <b>alfalfa</b> <b>weevil,</b> Hypera postica (Gyllenhal), is a serious, yet {{sporadic}} defoliator of alfalfa, Medicago sativa L., in Nebraska. A 2 -yr {{study was}} conducted in 2005 and 2006 to test for variation in degree-day requirements by location in eastern Nebraska. Sampling took place along a latitudinal gradient in three regions of eastern Nebraska. Three fields were sampled in each region during the 2 yr of the study. <b>Alfalfa</b> <b>weevil</b> larval degree-day requirements were found to vary by latitude in eastern Nebraska. <b>Alfalfa</b> <b>weevil</b> larvae were discovered in southern regions after fewer developmental degree-days had accumulated than in fields in the northern regions. Alfalfa weevils may be more damaging to alfalfa in southern regions than in northern regions of eastern Nebraska because they emerge earlier relative to alfalfa growth.

40|$|Three {{tests in}} southwestern Nebraska during 1971 and 1972 {{evaluated}} insecticides against the army cutworm. Adult alfalfa weevils did not damage new second growth alfalfa {{in a small}} plot study during a 3 -year period (1973 - 1975) at Gothenburg, NE. However, excellent control of larval alfalfa weevils was obtained. These results indicated a need to establish economic threshold levels for the <b>alfalfa</b> <b>weevil</b> in Nebraska to prevent unnecessary use of insecticides. Four tests to control the <b>alfalfa</b> <b>weevil</b> with registered insecticides verified the efficacy of these materials under Nebraska conditions. A series of tests conducted during 1975 at the Mead Field Laboratory were designed to evaluate plant resistance, cultural practices and insecticides. The use of alfalfa varieties with resistance to various insect pests of alfalfa {{appeared to be an}} ideal control method. During 1975 - 1977, a test was conducted each year at the Mead Field Laboratory to evaluate new experimental insecticides against the <b>alfalfa</b> <b>weevil</b> and other pest insects of alfalfa grown for forage.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} from 1990 through 1992 to determine consumption rates and feeding duration of adult clover leaf weevils, Hypera punctata (F.), {{to characterize the}} injury potential of this species during alfalfa regrowth. Adults were fed for 29 d in 1990 and 18 d in both 1991 and 1992. The mean cumulative consumption per adult was 27. 2 ± 1. 6 cm 2 and 92. 7 ± 3. 5 mg dry weight in 1991 and 24. 6 ± 0. 9 cm 2 and 87. 5 ± 2. 9 mg dry weight in 1992. The mean cumulative consumption pattern was curvilinear for both dry weight and leaf area consumption. Most consumption was within 11 d of adult eclosion. The peak consumption rate occurred ~ 5 d after adult emergence. Because the highest consumption rates and the greatest percentage of defoliation were within the first 11 d of emergence, adult clover leaf weevils potentially can delay regrowth of alfalfa stubble when adult emergence coincides with the 1 st harvest. Further, because adult consumption patterns between clover leaf <b>weevils</b> and <b>alfalfa</b> <b>weevils</b> are similar, <b>alfalfa</b> stubble defoliation thresholds developed for <b>alfalfa</b> <b>weevils</b> and cutworms {{also can be used}} for clover leaf weevils.

It has been investigated the population density and spatial distribution of <b>alfalfa</b> <b>weevil</b> on alfalfa in Ardabil during 2010. Using a 0. 25 m 2 quadrate sample unit a reliable sample size was 65, with maximum relative variation of 15 %. The relative variation (RV) of the primary sampling data was 13. 6. The highest population density of the <b>alfalfa</b> <b>weevil</b> was recorded on 17 th April. To estimate the spatial distribution pattern of this pest, data were analyzed through index of dispersion, Lloyd�s mean crowding, Morisita�s index and two regression models (Taylor�s Power Law and Iwao�s Patchiness Regression).

Iwao�s patchiness regression indicated that larvae, adult and total life cycle had aggregated spatial distribution (tc < tt), while pupae of <b>alfalfa</b> <b>weevil</b> exhibited a random pattern. The index of dispersion and Lloyd�s mean crowding methods indicated an aggregated distribution for this insect.
