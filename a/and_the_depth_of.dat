5|$|Several cultivars of P.atriplicifolia {{have been}} developed.

5|$|A similar {{initiative}} {{came from}} Norman Pierre Gentieu (1914–2009), an American writer who discovered Sorabji by reading his book Around Music {{just after the}} Second World War. Because of the post-war shortages in England, Gentieu sent Sorabji some provisions, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> their friendship {{appears to have been}} such that he continued to do so for the next four decades. In the early 1950s Gentieu made an offer to Sorabji to pay for the microfilming of his major piano works and to give some copies to selected libraries. All of his unpublished musical manuscripts were eventually microfilmed. Gentieu also sent Sorabji a tape recorder to record some of his music, but Sorabji did not do so.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{percent of}} Nescopeck Creek's {{watershed}} {{is made up}} of the Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia series. There is some urban development over lands containing the soil series. Other areas where this soil series occurs have been surface-mined. The limiting factor for plant growth in this series is the rocky surface <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the bedrock below. The Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia soil series occurs in the southeastern and parts of the southwestern parts of the Nescopeck Creek watershed. The Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris series is present in nine percent of Nescopeck Creek's watershed. The Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris soil series mostly is near Nescopeck Creek's source, but there is some of it in the central Nescopeck Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|Torpedo {{capability}} {{was always}} considered paramount. The lack of suitable aircraft and shortage {{of the weapon}} itself resulted in the strike arm of Coastal Command being severely handicapped. As late as 10 December 1941 the torpedo resources {{were given to the}} Fleet Air Arm (FAA) which would receive 75 percent of all torpedoes. Torpedoes were sensitive and highly costly in production terms. The weather conditions off enemy coasts made their use more complicated <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the water was considered too shallow. It was also uneconomical to use the weapon against low-tonnage shipping, Coastal Command's main target. Aside from that, the Beaufort torpedo-bomber was being posted overseas from August 1941 onwards.|$|E

5|$|The known {{material}} (hypodigm) of Miniopterus zapfei {{includes a}} mandible (lower jaw) with the fourth premolar (p4), first molar (m1), and second molar (m2); a mandible with m1; a mandible with m1 and m2; a mandible with m2 {{and the third}} molar (m3); a mandible without any teeth; and an isolated fourth upper premolar (P4).

25|$|Work on the {{colliery}} – one of {{the pioneering}} mines of the East Durham coalfield, began on 19 February 1838 but it was five years before the first coals were drawn.

Late shifts were even introduced for the first time, so that excavation could be carried out around the clock to finish the three-shafted pit as quickly as possible.|$|E

25|$|The first {{offshore}} wells {{drilled in}} the Beaufort used artificial islands as drilling platforms, {{but this was}} a winter drilling system, and was only practical in shallow water. In the mid-1970s, the introduction of a fleet of reinforced drillships extended the drilling season to include the 90 to 120 ice-free days of summer. This also enabled the industry to drill in the deeper waters of the Beaufort Sea. By the mid-1980s, variations on artificial island and drilling vessel technologies had extended both the drilling season <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> water at which the industry could operate.

25|$|The Fauvism of Matisse and Derain was {{virtually}} {{over by the}} spring of the 1907 Indépendants. And by the Salon d'Automne of 1907 it had ended for many others as well. The shift from bright pure colors loosely applied to the canvas gave way to a more calculated geometric approach. The priority of simplified form began to overtake the representational aspect of the works. The simplification of representational form gave way to a new complexity; {{the subject matter of the}} paintings progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field limited.|$|E
25|$|Artists at the {{forefront}} of the Parisian art scene at the outset of the 20th century would not fail to notice the tendencies toward abstraction inherent in the work of Cézanne, and ventured still further.
