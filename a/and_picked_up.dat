5|$|Because they {{deferred}} their {{selection to}} the second half during the opening coin toss, Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the half. The Hokies continued to rotate between quarterbacks Sean Glennon and Tyrod Taylor during the possession, <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> two first downs, one {{through the air and}} the other on the ground. After Glennon was sacked at the 50-yard line, however, the drive sputtered and the Hokies were forced to punt the ball.|$|E
5|$|After {{playing out}} his option with the Steelers, in July 1966 Johnson {{signed as a}} free agent with the Houston Oilers of the American Football League. He joined the Oilers with the hope of helping the team win an AFL championship. However, the team {{finished}} the season last in the Eastern Division with a record of 3–11. Johnson retired after the season at the age of 37. He completed his NFL career having carried 1,571 times for 6,803 yards and 48 touchdowns, <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> 1,478 yards on 186 pass receptions for seven more scores.|$|E
5|$|Between 7:00a.m. and 8:00a.m. CT on March 3, {{the morning}} Fischer was killed, Olivarez {{confirmed}} with Garza {{at the motel}} that the murder was successful. He then went to Martínez' shop {{to tell her the}} teenager was dead. She told Garza that she would not give him the money unless there was solid proof that Fischer was dead. Garza then talked with Olivarez and Puentes Pizaña at the motel room. A few hours after the murder, Martínez phoned Cisneros and told her that the job had been carried out. Cisneros arrived at her store minutes later and left a sealed envelope with the money. Cisneros then went to St. Joe <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> her daughter from school. Later that evening, Garza and Puentes Pizaña met with Martínez <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> the envelope. They headed back to the motel and Garza handed over the envelope to Olivarez. Garza claims that the hitmen received $3,500, though he stated he never counted the money. Martínez said she did and that it was $3,000. Investigators believe it could have been as much as $5,000. Garza was then picked up by his nephew from Matamoros and taken to the Harlingen airport, where he flew back to San Antonio. On his way to the airport, he passed through Rancho Viejo and recalled seeing police cars and a house cordoned off with yellow tape.|$|E

In the first Rugby World Cup in New Zealand and Australia, England were grouped in pool A alongside Australia, Japan and the United States. England lost their first game 19–6 against Australia.

Heston, an {{experienced}} horseman, took daily three-hour lessons in chariot driving after he arrived in Rome <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> the skill quickly. Heston was outfitted with special contact lenses to prevent the grit kicked up during the race from injuring his eyes.

5|$|In 1920, Radford {{reported}} to Pensacola, Florida, for flight training, and {{was promoted to}} lieutenant soon thereafter. During the 1920s and 1930s his sea duty alternated among several aircraft squadrons, fleet staffs, and tours in the U.S. with the Bureau of Aeronautics. It was during this time, while he served under Rear Admiral William Moffett, that he frequently interacted with politicians <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> the political acumen that would become useful later in his career. While he {{did not attend the}} Naval War College, as other rising officers did, Radford established himself as an effective officer who would speak his mind frankly, even to superiors.|$|E

5|$|The Yankees {{were just}} 1½ games behind the Toronto Blue Jays when they {{acquired}} Lee Smith, and he pitched nearly perfectly {{for the last}} month of the season. In eight games, Smith did not allow a single run <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> three saves and 11 strikeouts. The Yankees as a team, however, did poorly during {{the remainder of the}} season, and Toronto easily pulled away to win the division. Smith's New York career lasted just those eight games as he filed for free agency after the season. He signed with Baltimore for 1994 for $1.5 million plus incentives.|$|E

For his apparent public support of the other candidate, they demoted Heffernan to beat patrol work as a uniformed officer.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Georgia Tech's offense {{came on the}} ground from running back Tashard Choice and from quarterback scrambles by Ball. Choice ran the ball 21 times, netting 100 yards.

5|$|Vanderbilt's record against Georgia was 6–1; {{its only}} loss was 4–0, in 1898, and the all-time score was 184–4 {{in favor of}} the Commodores. The Bulldogs were favored to win their first meeting since 1912. In the first quarter, both teams were evenly matched. The Commodores had their best chance to score when Thomas Ryan beat the defense, but he dropped Neely's pass. Vanderbilt also had a chance to score when a Georgia field goal was blocked by Lynn Bomar <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> by Tot McCullough, who was caught from behind before he could score.|$|E
5|$|Claudette wobbled to the {{northwest}} over the Gulf of Mexico and gradually restrengthened. Upper-level winds steadily decreased, and Claudette again became a hurricane late on July 14. Just prior to landfall, it strengthened quickly <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> its forward motion in a more westerly direction, striking Port O'Connor, Texas, on July 15 as a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale with 90mph (150km/h) winds. Residents along and inland of the central Texas coast were caught off guard both by its intensity and its time of arrival. The hurricane was projected to make landfall in the evening hours of July 15, but instead came ashore before noon. Furthermore, some initial estimates suggested that Claudette had reached Category2 status, with sustained winds of up to 100mph (155km/h); these were based on unofficial observations which were not backed up by official data.|$|E
5|$|Formidable {{arrived at}} Sydney on 24 August, {{and had her}} hangar {{refitted}} to accommodate Allied ex-prisoners of war and soldiers for repatriation. Having left her air group behind to maximise the numbers of passengers she could carry, the ship arrived at Manila on 30 September, where she loaded over 1,000 Australian former prisoners of war on 4 October and unloaded them at Circular Quay in Sydney on 21 October. She departed three days later, bound for Karavia Bay, New Britain, where she loaded 1,254 men of the Indian Army and continued on to Singapore where she loaded Indian ex-PoWs before delivering them to Bombay. There Formidable loaded an Indian Army infantry battalion for transport to Batavia in the Dutch East Indies to maintain law and order until Dutch colonial troops could take over.

Costello asked Kent to team up with Bruno Bekkar, who was mostly known from working in his native New Zealand and Australia. Kent and Bekkar worked a tour for the WWC while Costello served as their manager. The team won the WWC North American Tag Team titles from Jack and Jerry Brisco on 22 October 1981. They then lost the titles to Invader I and Super Gladiator but quickly gained them back before {{dropping}} the titles for good to Invader and Gladiator on 26 January 1982. The Kent and Bekkar team only lasted through one tour of the Caribbean, after which Bruno Bekkar returned to Australia and New Zealand {{to work for the}} local promotions there.|$|E
5|$|In March 1779 the {{regiment}} was reassigned to the Northern Department, and marched to Springfield, Massachusetts. From Springfield they marched to Charlestown, New Hampshire <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> clothing and supplies.

Hazen had been secretly ordered to the area by Washington in April. Along with a large portion of Colonel Timothy Bedel's Regiment and Major Benjamin Whitcomb's New Hampshire rangers, they began to extend the road, a portion of which had been constructed in 1776 under the direction of Colonel Jacob Bayley.|$|E

The CFL named Durant Offensive Player of the Month for September after a month where he passed for 1387 yards and five touchdowns.
