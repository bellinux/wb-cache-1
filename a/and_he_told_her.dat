5|$|After her {{engagement}} to Day ended, Sabrina {{spent eight years}} at boarding houses around Birmingham. Day met {{and went on to}} marry an heiress, Esther Milnes, in 1778. Sabrina met an apothecary, Jarvis Wardley, who proposed marriage in an acrostic poem. She contacted Day for advice, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> in absolute terms not to marry Wardley, even writing an acrostic poem for her to use in turning him down. In 1783, she had become a lady's companion in Newport, Shropshire. It was there that she was approached by Day's friend, the man who helped choose her at the foundling hospital, John Bicknell. Bicknell was single and had spent the majority of his earnings from his law career in gambling dens. He had not paid much attention to Sabrina since selecting her with Day, but proposed marriage immediately.|$|E
500|$|The {{proposal}} surprised Naomi, as {{they had}} only been dating for a few months, but she [...] "feels duty bound" [...] to accept. Naomi instantly had second thoughts and when Paul wanted to tell everyone, {{in the hope that}} it might boost his mayoral position, she asked him to keep their engagement a secret. Naomi and Paul's relationship eventually ended after she had a one-night stand with Josh. Paul asked if they could try and work out their differences, but Naomi declined <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> she would not amount to anything.|$|E
500|$|In early 2001, Stratus became {{involved}} in an angle with WWF Chairman Vince McMahon, {{during a time when}} Vince's wife Linda was kayfabe institutionalized following a demand Vince had made for a divorce during an episode of SmackDown! on December 7, 2000. Vince and Stratus' relationship increasingly angered the boss' daughter, then-heel, Stephanie McMahon. On the February 19 episode of Raw, Stephanie and Trish were scheduled for a match, but it quickly got cancelled due to Stephanie getting stunned by Steve Austin. At No Way Out on February 25, Stratus and Stephanie squared off, with Stephanie scoring the victory after a run-in by William Regal. In the midst of a tag team match that pitted Vince and Stratus against Regal and Stephanie the next night on Raw, Stratus was the victim of a set-up by Vince, Stephanie and Regal. Regal executed his finisher, the Regal Cutter, on Stratus and Stephanie then dumped sewage over Stratus' body. Vince stood over Stratus, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> she was a [...] "toy" [...] with which he had [...] "grown tired of playing with". The angle continued the next week on Raw, with Vince forcing Stratus to strip down to her black bra and panties in the ring and bark like a dog. The storyline came to an end at WrestleMania X-Seven, when Stratus slapped Vince during his match against his son Shane, becoming a fan favorite in the process.|$|E
6000|$|Bernard {{began to}} laugh, <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> {{she must have}} had a very happy life--"to call a winter at Sorrento a sacrifice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! Heaven {{only knows}} what has become of him!' said the man. 'They went up aloft.' <b>And</b> then <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> what had happened.|$|R
60|$|She made no answer, {{though the}} change in Frank's tone moved her; <b>and</b> when <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> his errand, that thought also passed from her mind.|$|R
500|$|The {{miscarriage}} leaves Steffy devastated and {{she decides}} to leave town, ending her marriage to Liam. Wood noted that [...] "Steffy was so set on she really messed this up" [...] and noticed that Liam still had feelings for Hope. Speaking of the miscarriage {{and the end of}} Liam and Steffy's marriage, Wood explained: [...] "She is obviously trying a reason to get out of it. In her heart and soul, she wants to be with him. She felt he was her soulmate, but with everything that has happened, she feels it was her fault and she can't change that. She should never have gotten on that motorcycle <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> not to. There have been so many things that happened that it opens her eyes to the possibility that maybe he should be with Hope." [...] Upon Steffy's brief return to the show in 2015, she realizes that she still loves Liam, despite believing that these feelings were gone. Wood explained [...] "They lost a child together, so theyâ€™ll always have that emotional connection." [...] Despite liking the fact that Steffy [...] "speaks up" [...] and [...] "fights for love", Wood said that she wanted [...] "to see someone come in and sweep her off her feet and take that pain away", not wanting her to fight for [...] "a man that flip flops". However, Liam is involved with Steffy's cousin Ivy Forrester (Ashleigh Brewer) and Steffy does not win him back. Wood noted that [...] "in Steffy's mind, Ivy is just some new woman in town and Liam is fair game. He and Ivy have no history." [...] Eventually Liam breaks up with Ivy and after Steffy's marriage to Wyatt breaks down, Steffy and Liam rekindle their love and romance and they marry each other again for the third time.|$|E
2500|$|Kate Winslet sent {{producer}} Scott Rudin {{the script}} <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that her then husband, director Sam Mendes, {{would be perfect}} to direct it. She gave Mendes Yates' novel and told him, [...] "I really want to play this part". He read Haythe's script and then the book in quick succession. Haythe's first draft was very faithful to the novel, using large parts of Yates' own language, but Mendes told him {{to find ways to}} externalize what Frank and April do not say to each other.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few weeks}} after the birth of her {{daughter}} in 1965, Joni Anderson was gigging again around Yorkville, beginning to sing more of her original material for the first time, written with her unique open tunings. In March and April she found work at the Penny Farthing, a folk club in Toronto. There she met Chuck Mitchell, an American folk-singer from Michigan. Chuck was immediately attracted to her and impressed by her performance, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that he could get her steady work in the coffeehouses he knew in the United States. In one interview, Mitchell claimed she married Chuck only 36 hours after they met, but it is unclear if they were ever married in Toronto. Sometime in late April, Mitchell left Canada for the first time, going with Chuck to the US, where the two began playing music together. Joni, 21 years old, married Chuck in an official ceremony in his hometown in June 1965 and took his surname. She said, [...] "I made my dress and bridesmaids' dresses. We had no money... I walked down the aisle brandishing my daisies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir; but {{it appears}} she asked Sam who was with you, <b>and</b> when <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> she said, All right, {{she wanted to see}} Colonel Pendleton too." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>And</b> then <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> the woeful {{story of}} how he had been barred out, and she gasped all the time. 'But my mother,' she said, 'my mother----' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{with the}} bishop's good-will, {{you may be}} sure, Mary," [...] Terence laughed; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> then <b>told</b> <b>her</b> how <b>he</b> had become possessed of it.|$|R
2500|$|Ishida and Abe {{returned}} to Ogu, where they remained until his death. During their love-making this time, Abe put the knife {{to the base}} of Ishida's penis, and said she would make sure he would never play around with another woman. Ishida laughed at this. Two nights into this bout of sex, Abe began choking Ishida, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> to continue, saying that this increased his pleasure. She had him do it to her as well. On the evening of May 16, 1936, Abe used her obi sash to cut off Ishida's breathing during orgasm, and they both enjoyed it. They repeated this for two more hours. Once Abe stopped the strangulation, Ishida's face became distorted, and would not return to its normal appearance. Ishida took 30 tablets of a sedative called Calmotin to try to soothe his pain. According to Abe, as Ishida started to doze, he told her, [...] "You'll put the cord around my neck and squeeze it again while I'm sleeping, won't you... If you start to strangle me, don't stop, because it is so painful afterward." [...] Abe commented that she wondered if he had wanted her to kill him, but on reflection decided he must have been joking.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Tanhuma {{taught that}} Moses prostrated himself before the Israelites {{and said to}} them the words of [...] "You are to pass over the Jordan," [...] noting that he would not. Moses gave the Israelites the {{opportunity}} to pray for him, but they did not. The Midrash compared this to a king who had many children by a noble lady. The lady was undutiful {{to him and he}} decided to divorce her. He told her {{that he was going to}} marry another wife. She asked who, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her.</b> She summoned her children and told them that their father intended to divorce her and marry the other woman, and asked the children if they could bear being subjected to her. She thought that perhaps they would understand what she meant and would intercede with their father on her behalf, but they did not understand. As they did not understand, she commanded them only for their own sake to be mindful of the honor of their father. So it was with Moses. When God told him in [...] "You shall not go over this Jordan," [...] Moses spoke to the Israelites and stressed the words in [...] "You are to pass over." ...|$|E
2500|$|The apparitions of Our Lady of Good Help were {{reported}} by Adele Brise in 1859. In December 2010, Bishop David L. Ricken of Green Bay, Wisconsin approved the apparition as worthy of belief, as the first Marian apparition approved in the United States at the local level. In Robinsonville (now called Champion) WI, a young Belgian immigrant woman named Adele Brise was walking through a wooded area when she saw a beautiful woman standing between a maple and a hemlock tree. She saw the lady again {{on her way to}} Mass, and walked past her again. After Mass she told her priest about the apparition, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> to ask the Lady [...] "In God's name, who are you and what do you want of me?" [...] When Adele walked past the spot again, the Lady was there, and Adele asked what she was told by the priest. The Lady replied, [...] "I am the Queen of Heaven who prays for the conversion of sinners." [...] She gave Adele the mission to teach the children of the area their Catechism, which Adele did faithfully. Soon after, Adele's father built a small chapel between the trees, and later two more churches were built on the spot before the present brick church, built in 1942. The apparitions, attributed to Our Lady of Good Help, were approved on December 8, 2010, by Bishop David L. Ricken of the Diocese of Green Bay.|$|E
6000|$|One {{of these}} came <b>and</b> asked why <b>he</b> was there, <b>and</b> when <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> Sparkle said, [...] "You must {{work for us}} {{if you want to}} earn the golden wand." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>And</b> then <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> the woful {{story of}} how he had been barred out, and she gasped all the time. [...] "But my mother," [...] she said, [...] "my mother"-- ...|$|R
60|$|Sir Gregory {{spoke to}} Mrs. Brownlow {{on the same}} subject, <b>and</b> as <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> what had taken place between him and Edith, she felt herself {{compelled}} {{to speak to her}} daughter.|$|R
60|$|Then King Arthur {{told the}} Queen his sister {{all that had}} befallen. For he told her how that Gareth had come thither and in what guise; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> how Gareth had dwelt all that year unknown at the court {{under the name of}} Beaumains because of the {{whiteness}} of his hands; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> how that Beaumains had gone forth upon that adventure to the Castle Dangerous; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> how he had succeeded in that adventure; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of the several other things that are herein told, and ever Queen Margaise listened to him.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> {{the mission}} upon which Pierre had been despatched.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bah! Green {{was there}} on other business." [...] <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of the suspicions the {{messenger}} entertained against Mr. Caryll.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{shall be}} sent back," [...] said Mr. Carling, [...] "but not till the missing number is replaced." [...] <b>And</b> <b>he</b> then <b>told</b> <b>her</b> what <b>he</b> had done.|$|R
6000|$|Down in the drawing-room, however, Mrs. Gildersleeve {{found the}} famous Q.C. {{absorbed in the}} perusal of that day's paper. She came across towards him, pale as a ghost, and with ashen lips. [...] "Gilbert," [...] she said slowly, blurting it all out in her horror, without one word of warning, [...] "that dreadful man Nevitt has seen Gwennie again, <b>and</b> <b>he's</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> knows all, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> means to ruin us, <b>and</b> <b>he's</b> heard of the marriage, <b>and</b> <b>he's</b> gone down to Mambury to hunt up the records!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> then <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of his {{experiences}} with this strange creature--of how twice the wild man had saved his life--of the wondrous strength, and agility, and bravery--of the brown {{skin and the}} handsome face.|$|R
60|$|Isen. True enough. She {{complained to}} Conrad of her scruples, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> {{that by the}} law was the {{knowledge}} of sin.|$|E
6000|$|His father said: [...] "No. Hasn't he come in yet?" [...] <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> how he {{had been}} looking everywhere, and she burst out crying.|$|E
6000|$|... "Through Eliza--who said----" [...] <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> {{about the}} {{incident}} of the ulster and the dog-cart, adding that he believed it to be entirely untrue.|$|E
50|$|Weeks {{before the}} video's broadcasting, Medina had {{revealed}} its existence {{in an interview}} with El Espectador newspaper. Because of this, Coronell stated that Medina had broken the deal <b>and</b> so <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her.</b> She admitted so and the journalist announced its publication.|$|R
60|$|On the Yonkers basis {{they became}} more intimate, more personal, and Dan <b>told</b> <b>her</b> about Ponkwasset Falls {{and his mother}} <b>and</b> sisters; <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> about his father, {{and she said she}} should like to see his father; she thought he must be like her father.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so {{very much}} as yet," [...] he answered, soberly, for he hated to {{disappoint}} the girl who was so dear to him. <b>And</b> then <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of all that had happened. She shuddered when she found {{he had been a}} prisoner of Sid Merrick and his followers.|$|R
60|$|Then {{they went}} and had {{tea in the}} {{refreshment}} room, leaving the jackdaw and the other impediments {{in charge of a}} porter, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|She led Merton to a sepulchral little chamber upstairs, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> all {{the story}} of Mr. Warren, his son, and the {{daughter}} of the minister.|$|E
60|$|The {{interest}} she displayed invited Joe's confidence, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of {{the life}} led by himself and his particular friends in a manner which interested the little woman deeply.|$|E
60|$|Quite {{naturally}} <b>he</b> {{grew more}} <b>and</b> more personal. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of his father, the busy {{director of a}} lumber company, and of his mother, sickly and inert.|$|R
60|$|Lane {{talked to}} Bessy of the war. Words came like magic to his lips. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of the thunder and fire and blood and heroism, of fight and agony <b>and</b> death. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of himself--of his {{service in the}} hours that tried his soul. Bessy passed from fascinated {{intensity}} to rapture and terror. She clung to Lane. She kissed him. She wept.|$|R
60|$|For {{some time}} the countess {{was unable to}} speak, her joy was too great for words. Then tears came to her relief, and she sobbed out exclamations of joy and gratitude. Ronald said nothing until she had {{somewhat}} recovered <b>her</b> calmness, <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> {{the manner in which}} Marshal Saxe had obtained the two orders of release.|$|R
