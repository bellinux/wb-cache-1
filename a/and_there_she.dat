Garthwaite was born in Leicestershire in 1688. She began her freelance textile design career in York, sending the finished designs up to London. She moved to the London silkweaving center of Spitalfields with her widowed sister around 1730, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>she</b> created designs for woven silks over the next three decades.

Fox added, {{regarding}} {{the beginning of their}} relationship, [...] "It was a relationship that came out of nowhere, but the writers and the audience were so charmed by Nancy and Darren together that it's kept going". When asked if they were surprised at being initially paired up Dawson said, [...] "Yes, i was. The scene in which they got together was absolutely hilarious. Darren just looked up <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>she</b> was!" [...] before Fox added [...] "I never {{thought they were going to}} last, but we just went for it full throttle".

[...] She soon became known in St Petersburg's artistic circles, regularly giving public readings. That year, she wrote unenthusiastically to a friend, “He has loved me for three years now, and I {{believe that it is}} my fate to be his wife.

500|$|... "Another Suitcase in Another Hall" [...] {{was written}} by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice while they were {{developing}} the Evita for broadway in 1976. Both were extremely intrigued by the stories surrounding the life of Eva Perón while researching about her during the mid-1970s. They came to know about her husband Juan Perón, and his affinity for young women, and Rice and Webber decided {{to use it as}} one of the backstories behind Eva and Juan's rise to power. In the original musical, the song is performed by the character of Juan's teenage mistress (played by Siobhán McCarthy) after she is [...] "kicked out" [...] by his future wife, Eva. According to director Michael Grandage, the story took the [...] "edge off" [...] a supposed fairy tale like interpretation of Eva and Juan, unveiling their ambitions and cut-throat personality. From a production point-of-view, it also allowed Grandage to show ruthlessness of Eva, when Juan allows her to throw his [...] "mistress" [...] away.

500|$|Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called [...] "Alive" [...] the [...] "biggest surprise" [...] of J to tha L–O! The Remixes. William Ruhlmann of Allmusic {{gave the}} song a {{negative}} review, writing that her vocal limitations [...] "come {{to the fore}} when she is spotlighted on such a song without a dance arrangement to support her". He stated, however, that her vocal limitations are not [...] "as big a deal" [...] as her lack of emotional involvement: [...] "Though she tries to fake it here <b>and</b> <b>there,</b> <b>she</b> still sounds like she's singing her grocery list instead of the song's clichéd lyrics". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly called the song a [...] "syrupy ballad" [...] that is [...] "neither alive nor a remix". He stated that {{if you listen to}} the song long enough, [...] "you may actually be conned into thinking Lopez's voice and songs are passable". He concluded by stating as a result of [...] "Alive", J to tha L–O! The Remixes may be the most insidious album ever made.|$|E
500|$|In 1961, Holt married bank manager Gilbert LaPiere, who adopted Cher (under {{the name}} Cheryl LaPiere) and Georganne, and {{enrolled}} them at Montclair College Preparatory School, {{a private school}} in Encino, whose students were mostly from affluent families. The school's upper-class environment presented a challenge for Cher; biographer Connie Berman wrote, [...] " [...] stood out from the others in both her striking appearance and outgoing personality." [...] A former classmate commented, [...] "I'll never forget seeing Cher for the first time. She was so special... She was like a movie star, right then <b>and</b> <b>there...</b> <b>She</b> {{said she was going}} to be a movie star and we knew she would." [...] Despite not being an excellent student, Cher was intelligent and creative, according to Berman. She earned high grades, excelling in French and English classes. As an adult, she discovered that she had dyslexia. Cher achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior: she performed songs for students during the lunch hours and surprised peers when she wore a midriff-baring top. She later recalled, [...] "I was never really in school. I was always thinking about when I was grown up and famous." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{young are}} precocial and already covered in down when they {{emerge from the}} eggs. Soon after they are hatched the female leads the chicks {{to one of the}} many wadis that wind across the plains <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>she</b> teaches them to peck at and ingest seeds. It is four or five weeks before they are fledged and able to fly. Meanwhile, the problem of {{supplying}} them with water is solved by the male which has specially adapted, absorbent down on his belly. While at the waterhole he immerses himself in the water to saturate the plumage which absorbs a quantity that is sufficient for the chicks to last them until the following day. When he leaves the waterhole with his water-laden feathers, the male emits a repeated high-pitched [...] "queet - queet - queet" [...] calls. When the female and chicks pick up the sounds of his approach, they reciprocate, and by this means the male can find his family even when they have moved away from the nest. On his arrival he assumes an upright posture and raises his wings, displaying the wet belly feathers. This is the sign for the chicks to approach and stand underneath him with their beaks upturned and suck the fluid from between the feathers.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 19 November, the ECMM became aware that {{organised}} resistance had ceased in Vukovar, {{but it did not}} receive any information on the fate of the hospital patients. Consequently, the head of the ECMM, ambassador Dirk Jan van Houten, contacted Rašeta asking him to intervene on the ECMM's behalf. That day, a JNA unit arrived at the hospital and Bosanac was taken to meet JNA Colonel Mile Mrkšić. According to Bosanac, Mrkšić told her that he was not obligated by the evacuation agreement. Even though the ICRC was not granted access to Vukovar by JNA officers at the scene, in the early evening of 19 November, ICRC representative Nicolas Borsinger managed to reach the hospital claiming he had an appointment with [...] "a general". Once there, Borsinger found a JNA captain in charge of the facility who agreed to grant the ICRC access. Borsinger then rejoined the ICRC convoy that was moving towards the hospital to evacuate it. The hospital was also toured by French reporter Agnès Vahramian that day, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>she</b> recorded an interview with Jean-Michel Nicolier, a wounded Frenchman who fought alongside Croatian forces in Vukovar.
