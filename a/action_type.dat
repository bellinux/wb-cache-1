25|$|Handguns are {{becoming}} increasingly popular for hunting. Intended to be fired {{with one or two}} hands, but lacking a shoulder support, handguns are more challenging to shoot accurately than a long gun (a rifle or shotgun). Hunting handguns differ from defensive handguns in a number of ways; hunting handguns usually have longer barrels, better sights (often mounting telescopic sights or red dot sights), and, depending on the game, will fire a much more powerful cartridge. Rimfire hunting handguns can be of any <b>action</b> <b>type,</b> but centerfire hunting handguns are dominated by the single shot and revolver actions, such as the Thompson Center Arms Contender.|$|E
500|$|Children of Mana was {{developed}} by Nex Entertainment, who had previously created dungeon crawl games in the Shining series, in collaboration with Square Enix. It was designed by series creator Koichi Ishii, directed by Yoshiki Ito, and produced by Takashi Orikata and Katsuji Aoyama. The game features an opening cinematic by Production I.G. The game was planned from the start as a [...] "fun-for-all <b>action</b> <b>type</b> game" [...] {{taking advantage of the}} DS's capabilities. Ishii was especially focused on creating a truly cooperative multiplayer game, which he had wanted to create since Secret of Mana (1993), the second game in the series. Despite this, he chose not to utilize the DS's Nintendo Wi-Fi functionality in order to effect an experience in which players would interact with people in the near vicinity rather than remotely, in congruence with the local multiplayer found in Secret of Mana. He also designed the multiplayer {{to create a sense of}} chaotic excitement, such that players could interact without focusing on the difficulty or competing against each other. Several of the game's design choices were meant to focus more on the action components, such as attacks sending enemies flying across the screen and the use of both the buttons and stylus to keep the controls simple and directly connected to the action. The randomly generated dungeon crawling mechanic was also a means toward this end. Although Ishii has said that the games in the series are only thematically connected, he has also asserted in an interview that Children is set ten years after the 2007 game Dawn of Mana, which depicts the events of the cataclysm.|$|E

Complying with the methodological traditions of the field of competitive dynamics, the study was conducted using a structured content analytic procedure to isolate the industry specific <b>action</b> <b>types</b> from publicly available news items and Nokelainen’s generic typology code sheet to transform the isolated actions into generic actions. From an elementary perspective, a total of 7 out of Nokelainen’s 8 elementary generic <b>action</b> <b>types</b> were isolated.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} the {{distinction}} between <b>action</b> <b>types</b> and act tokens is relevant for a proper understanding {{of the distinction between}} prima facie obligations and all out obligations. After a discussion of the approach in which norms that deal with <b>action</b> <b>types</b> are analysed in terms of the deontic classification of individual acts, we explore the opposite approach. We take norms that deal with <b>action</b> <b>types</b> as primitive, and show how the evaluation of individual acts is influenced (but not determined) by the deontic status of the several <b>action</b> <b>types</b> which these acts instantiate. This view is formalised, first in a simple version which disregards exceptions to norms, and then in a more complex variant, which takes exceptions into account. Finally the distinction between <b>action</b> <b>types</b> and act tokens is used to characterise the distinction between weak and strong permissions. content areas: ought-to-do logic, <b>action</b> <b>types,</b> act tokens, prima facie obligations, exceptions, weak and strong permissio...|$|R

2500|$|... 1988 {{also saw}} the debut of Telenet Japan's Exile, a series of action-platform RPGs, {{beginning}} with XZR: Idols of Apostate. The series was controversial for its plot, which revolves around a time-traveling Crusades-era Syrian Islamic Assassin who assassinates various religious/historical figures as well as modern-day political leaders, with similarities to the present-day Assassin's Creed action game series. The gameplay of Exile included both overhead exploration and side-scrolling combat, featured a heart monitor to represent the player's Attack Power and Armour Class statistics, and another controversial aspect of the game involved taking drugs (instead of potions) that increase/decrease attributes but with side-effects such as affecting the heart-rate or causing death. An early attempt at incorporating a point-and-click interface in a real-time overhead action RPG was Silver Ghost, a 1988 NEC PC-8801 game by Kure Software Koubou. It was an action-strategy RPG where characters could be controlled using a cursor. It was cited by Camelot Software Planning's Hiroyuki Takahashi as inspiration for the Shining series of tactical RPGs. According to Takahashi, Silver Ghost was [...] "a simulation <b>action</b> <b>type</b> of game where you had to direct, oversee and command multiple characters." [...] Unlike later tactical RPGs, however, Silver Ghost was not turn-based, but instead used real-time strategy and action role-playing game elements. A similar game released by Kure Software Koubou that same year was First Queen, a unique hybrid between a real-time strategy, action RPG, and strategy RPG. Like an RPG, the player can explore the world, purchase items, and level up, and like a strategy video game, it focuses on recruiting soldiers and fighting against large armies rather than small parties. The game's [...] "Gochyakyara" [...] ("Multiple Characters") system let the player control one character at a time while the others are controlled by computer AI that follow the leader, and where battles are large-scale with characters sometimes filling an entire screen.|$|E

The present study provides a computational-theory-level analysis on which feature may take {{a crucial role in}} recognition {{of emotional}} attributes in human actions represented as point-light display. Lead by the previous theoretical works and empirical findings, the velocity and acceleration profile was investigated as a major feature of emotional attributes classification. The results showed that emotional attributes in actions as well as <b>action</b> <b>types</b> could be identified by covariance of velocity profiles among multiple body parts. Since, despite different velocity profiles in different actions, these features for emotional attributes were found commonly in multiple different actions, it suggests that the action styles may be mediated by an information channel parallel to <b>action</b> <b>types</b> per se...|$|R
