They were given a physical fitness test, a medical check and a questionnaire relating to life style, including a stress check list and a life satisfaction scale developed by the authors(1991). The stress check list consisted of 9 items while the life satisfaction scale consisted of 6 items in which each item was scored on a scale of 1 to 4 point. Based on a mean and standard deviation of each scale score for all subjects, four mental health <b>patterns,</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 2 Hatsu-Ratsu 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 Yuu-Yuu 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 Huu-Huu 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Heto-Heto 2 ̆ 2, were classified, and the relationship, including some variables relating to health, was analyzed.

40|$|The {{modulated}} annual cycle (MAC) of the Indo-Pacific warm pool (IPWP) heat centre {{location is}} investigated using the empirical mode decomposition-ensemble empirical mode decomposition method. The MAC and its interannual variability mainly affect the zonal and vertical {{locations of the}} heat centre; in fall and winter of El Nino years, the heat centre moves eastward from its normal location, with very little change in its meridional position. Four patterns of the heat centre trajectory in the IPWP are identified using the self-organizing map algorithm. Patterns 1 and 3 are both similar to a saddle, but pattern 1 is more winding. The shapes of <b>patterns</b> <b>2</b> and 4 are similar, but tilt in different directions: <b>pattern</b> <b>2</b> tilts southwest whereas pattern 4 tilts west. Of all the four patterns, the persistence of <b>pattern</b> <b>2</b> is generally relatively high. The trajectory of the heat centre develops in the sequence of patterns: 1 - 2 - 4 - 3 - 1.

Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood of unrelated Egyptian buffalo females. The PCR products of investigated genes were subjected to single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis.

40|$|Two {{patterns}} of neural activity {{were identified in}} excised buccal ganglia of Aplysia californica. Both are expressed in many cells, and each can be expressed independently. Us-ing cells B 4 and 85 as monitors of the activity patterns, we searched the buccal ganglia for ceils initiating the patterns. Two electrically coupled cells, 831 and B 32, can initiate what we termed <b>pattern</b> <b>2.</b> The cells are active before <b>pattern</b> <b>2</b> is expressed. Stimuli initiating <b>pattern</b> <b>2</b> excite B 31 lB 32. De-polarizing B 31 /B 32 induces the pattern, while hyperpolar-izing them can prevent its expression. The cells have un-usual features. Their somata do not sustain conventional action potentials, and depolarization causes a regenerative response. B 33 differs from 831 /B 32 in that its soma sustains conventional action potentials but otherwise has similar fea-tures. 834 {{also seems to be}} inexcitable but has weaker syn-aptic input than 831 lB 32 and appears unable to induce pat-tern 2.

B 35 is also able to initiate <b>pattern</b> <b>2.</b> B 37 is presynaptic to B 31 /B 32 and can initiate <b>pattern</b> <b>2</b> via its effects on them.

Since the buccal ganglia are involved in generating feeding behavior, further studies on the newly identified cells may provide insights into the neural control of feeding behavior, and provide a neural sub-strate for studying modulation of the feeding patterns by associative learning.

Our test re-sults and mathematical review find that, contrary to intu-ition, <b>Pattern</b> <b>2.</b> 1 performs better than Pattern 1. 1 due to idiosyncrasies in MediaWiki.

40|$|Occult {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) infection (OBI) {{is defined}} as low plasma level of HBV DNA with undetectable HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) outside the pre-seroconversion window period. The mechanisms leading to OBI remain largely unknown. The potential role of specific amino acid substitutions in the S protein from OBI on HBsAg production and excretion was examined in vitro. HBsAg was quantified in culture supernatants and cell extracts of HuH- 7 cells transiently transfected with plasmids containing the S gene of eight HBsAg+ controls and 18 OBI clones. The intracellular (IC) /extracellular (EC) HBsAg production ratio was ∼ 1. 0 {{for the majority of}} controls. Three IC/EC HBsAg patterns were observed in OBI strains clones: pattern 1 defined as IC/EC ratio 1. 0 in 5 / 18 OBI clones; <b>pattern</b> <b>2</b> with detectable IC but low or undetectable EC HBsAg (IC/EC: 7. 0 - 800) in 6 / 18 OBIs; and pattern 3 with both low or undetectable IC and EC HBsAg in 7 / 18 clones. Intracellular immunofluorescence staining showed that, in <b>pattern</b> <b>2,</b> HBsAg was concentrated around the nucleus suggesting retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. Substitutions M 75 T, Y 100 S or P 178 R were present in 4 / 6 <b>pattern</b> <b>2</b> OBI clones. Site-directed mutagenesis-corrected mutations reversed HBsAg excretion to pattern 1 and, when introduced in a control clone, induced <b>pattern</b> <b>2</b> except for Y 100 S.

This study examined a potential {{limitation of this}} technique, focusing on the measurement of the ventriculoatrial (V–A) interval from the coronary sinus (CS) during PHP. Methods: Our subjects were 9 patients undergoing electrophysiological studies before successful catheter ablation of a posteroseptal AP. During PHP, retrograde conduction occurred over an AP when the pacing stimulus to atrium (S–A) interval recorded near the AP remained unchanged whether the His bundle (HB) was captured or not (pattern 1), or when a loss of HB capture was associated {{with an increase in}} the S–A interval and no change in the V–A interval near the AP (<b>pattern</b> <b>2).</b> Results: <b>Patterns</b> 1 and <b>2</b> were observed in 5 (56 %) and 2 (22 %) patients, respectively. However, in the remaining 2 patients (22 %), loss of HB capture during PHP was associated with an increase in the S–A interval (as in <b>pattern</b> <b>2),</b> whereas the V–A interval near the AP could not be measured because no ventricular electrogram was visible on the CS recording (pattern 3); therefore, the presence of AP could not be confirmed by PHP.

Conclusions: PHP {{may not be able to}} discriminate between a retrograde septal AP and AV nodal conduction in patients whose proximal CS recording shows no visible ventricular electrogram...|$|R
