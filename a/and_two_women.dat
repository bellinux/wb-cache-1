5|$|The {{first modern}} attempt {{to settle the}} area {{was made by the}} Yishuv, the body of Jewish {{residents}} in Mandatory Palestine, on 23 February 1921, when the British Mandate government allowed discharged soldiers from the Jewish Legion to settle in the area. Nine men <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>women</b> attempted the task, but after four months were forced to leave because water was not found in the area.|$|E
5|$|In 1981 McGovern {{joined the}} Capitol Hill staff of Joe Moakley, a Democratic U.S. Representative from Massachusetts. He was {{appointed}} by Moakley in 1990 to lead a House task force investigating the 1989 murder of six Jesuit priests <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>women</b> in El Salvador by the Salvadoran Army. He later advocated cutting off U.S. funding for the U.S. Army School of the Americas, where several of the military members had been trained.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, in {{the wake}} of the 1995 Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, {{administrative}} control over Bani Na'im was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). On August 31, 2010, four Israelis, two men <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>women,</b> were killed in a Hamas drive-by shooting on the road between Kiryat Arba and Bani Naim. The attack was condemned by Israel and the PNA.|$|E
5|$|Mercator was apprehended in Rupelmonde {{and imprisoned}} in the castle. He {{was accused of}} {{suspicious}} correspondence with the Franciscan friars in Mechelen but no incriminating writings were uncovered in his home or at the friary in Mechelen. At the same time his well placed friends petitioned on his behalf, but whether his friend Antoine Perronet was helpful is unknown: Perronet, as a bishop, would have to support {{the activities of the}} Inquisition. After seven months Mercator was released for lack of evidence against him but others on the list suffered torture and execution: two men were burnt at the stake, another was beheaded <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>women</b> were entombed alive.|$|E
5|$|The Bangladeshi {{delegation}} {{consisted of}} four officials and four competitors: two men <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>women,</b> {{who took part}} in three different sports—athletics, boxing and swimming. (At the previous Commonwealth Youth Games, Bangladesh had a delegation of ten athletes.) None of the athletes won any medals. Papia Rani Sarkar finished sixth in the semifinal round of the 100 metres for women; bantamweight boxer Riyad Hossen received a bye into the quarterfinal, but then lost to Obedy Mutapa of Zambia. In the swimming heats, Sonia Akter finished 22nd in the 50m backstroke and 19th in the 50m butterfly, and Anik Islam finished 12th in the 50m butterfly and 14th in the 100m butterfly.|$|E

5|$|Four Egyptian taekwondo practitioners, two men <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>women,</b> {{qualified}} for the Olympics, all of whom finished first at the African Qualification tournament, except for Abdelrahman Ossama in the men's 80 kg class, who was second behind Morocco's Issam Chernoubi. Tamer Bayoumi, a bronze medalist from the 2004 Olympics, was the most successful of the quartet. In the 58 kg class he defeated Nursultan Mamayev of Kazakhstan in the round of 16 before losing in sudden death to Lee Dae-Hoon of South Korea, the eventual silver medalist, in the quarterfinals. In the repechage he was defeated by Thailand's Pen-Ek Karaket. The only other Egyptian to win a match was Hedaya Malak, in the women's 57 kg, who overcame Robin Cheong of New Zealand before being defeated by Marlène Harnois of France, an eventual bronze medalist. In his first bout, Ossama lost to Tommy Mollet of the Netherlands in sudden death, while Seham El-Sawalhy, the 2010 and 2012 African champion, was eliminated by Sweden's Elin Johansson in the round of 16 of the women's 67 kg class.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Johnson, {{as leader}} of the Women's Suffrage Movement, and Eugenia Lockhart, the organization's secretary, went to London to plead the case for suffrage. They met with the London branch of the International Alliance of Women to discuss the {{situation}} in the Bahamas, claiming that though they had the support of the majority of Bahamian women, many women could not voice their approval because they were employed by merchants and the government who were opposed to the cause. They also sought an audience at the Colonial Office to air their grievances, accompanied by the chairman of the PLP, Henry Milton Taylor. They met with the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Iain Macleod, <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>women</b> British Parliamentarians, Baroness Joan Vickers and Baroness Eirene White. The Bahamians were assured that their case was accepted and that change would soon follow. They returned, but no change was forthcoming.|$|E
5|$|Since 1964, when it competed {{under the}} banner of Tanganyika, Tanzania had sent athletes to twelve editions of the Summer Olympic Games. On 7 July 2016, it became the first country to submit its {{official}} team for the 2016 Summer Olympics held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The nation chose judoka Andrew Thomas Mlugu as its flagbearer in the opening ceremony. A total of seven Tanzanians, five men <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>women,</b> travelled to Rio de Janeiro and competed in three different sports: track and field, judo, and swimming. Alphonce Felix Simbu, who finished fifth in the men's marathon, was the nation's most successful competitor at the Games, and thus the nation failed to win its first Olympic medal since 1980. Nonetheless, he was selected to carry the Tanzanian flag at the closing ceremony.|$|E

5|$|Tanzania competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. Seven athletes, {{five men}} <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>women,</b> competed in five events across three sports, {{but did not}} win any medals. Hilal Hemed Hilal, however, set a new {{national}} record in the men's 50 m freestyle event. Four athletes took part {{in track and field}} athletics, all in marathons, while two participated in the swimming tournament's 50 m freestyle category. The flagbearer for the opening ceremony was Andrew Thomas Mlugu, who was Tanzania's first Olympic judoka. His counterpart in the closing ceremony was Alphonce Felix Simbu, who had earned the nation's best finish at the Games by placing fifth in the men's marathon. Prior to these Games, Tanzania had sent athletes to twelve editions of the Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The {{demolition}} of the residential towers that {{had served as}} the Barksdale organization's prime territory pushes their dealers back out onto the streets of Baltimore. Stringer Bell continues his reform of the organization by cooperating with other drug lords, sharing with one another territory, product and profits. Stringer's proposal is met with a curt refusal from Marlo Stanfield, leader of a new, growing crew. Against Stringer's advice, Avon decides to take Marlo's territory by force and the two gangs become embroiled in a bitter turf war with multiple deaths. Omar Little continues to rob the Barksdale organization wherever possible. Working with his new boyfriend Dante <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>women,</b> he is once more a serious problem. The violence related to the drug trade makes it an obvious choice of investigation for Cedric Daniels' permanently established Major Crimes Unit.|$|E
5|$|German luger Georg Hackl is {{the overall}} medal {{leader in the}} sport, having {{collected}} {{a total of five}} medals (three golds and two silvers) in the men's singles, during the six Winter Games in which he competed (1988–2006). Following his victory at the 1992 Winter Olympics, Hackl was the first male luger to successfully defend an Olympic title, in 1994. By repeating this feat in Nagano 1998, he joined two other men (Swedish figure skater Gillis Grafström and German skier Ulrich Wehling) <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>women</b> (Norwegian figure skater Sonja Henie and American speed skater Bonnie Blair) who had won the same individual event in three consecutive Olympic Games. Hackl was also the first-ever Olympian to win at least one medal in five consecutive Olympics. This effort was matched by Armin Zöggeler of Italy, who won his fifth straight Olympic medal (bronze) in the men's singles at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In 2002, Zöggeler outperformed Hackl and prevented him from reaching a unique fourth successive gold medal. Four years later, in Turin, Zöggeler became the second male luger to win back-to-back titles. Ten-time World Cup champion Markus Prock of Austria never fulfilled his success at Olympic level: in 1992 and 1994, Prock beat Georg Hackl to the World Cup title, but ended up losing the Olympic gold medal to the German.|$|E

5|$|The Federated States of Micronesia is a {{collection}} of some 6,000 islands in the South Pacific ocean that includes approximately 100,000 people. The nation is composed of several states that each embody a prominent ethnic group amongst the island group, and lies approximately three-quarters of the way between Hawaii and Indonesia. After World War II, the Micronesian island chain became a United Nations trust territory administered by the United States. The Federated States of Micronesia became an independent country on 1986, but freely associates with the United States, which handles matters of defense. The Federated States of Micronesia sent its first delegation to participate in the Olympics approximately 14 years after it became a sovereign entity, sending three men <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>women</b> to the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Between then and Beijing in 2008, three male and two female Micronesian athletes participating across three sports have appeared at the Olympics at every instance. Prior to Beijing, there had been no medalists from the Federated States of Micronesia; no medals were won by Micronesian athletes at the Beijing games either. Up to and including the Beijing Olympics, weightlifter Manuel Minginfel had been the flagbearer for Micronesia at every opening ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} An-2s {{had observed}} the attack {{from a distance}} and managed to escape without damage. Four Hmongs, two men <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>women,</b> {{had been killed by}} the communist attack. Nevertheless, the TSQ-81 radar and its associated equipment was undamaged. Shortly afterwards, what remained of one of the An-2 biplanes was put on display in front of the That Luang Monument, Vientiane’s most important Buddhist shrine, as proof of North Vietnamese military activities in the kingdom. Despite the attack, the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane and the USAF refused to alter their strategy for defending Lima Site 85. Lieutenant-Colonel Clarence F. Blanton, commander of USAF personnel at the facility, was given no authority to supervise his own perimeter or to order a retreat if they again came under attack. Throughout January and February, intelligence collected by the Hmongs confirmed that a major assault on Lima Site 85 was being prepared, but Sullivan and the U.S. military took no steps to strengthen the defenses. In late February, a Combat Controller, Technical Sergeant James Gary, arrived to augment the defenses by directing air strikes. He was replaced in this duty by Sergeant Roger D. Huffman on about 4 March.|$|E
5|$|Tonga {{competed in}} the 2011 Commonwealth Youth Games held in the British Crown Dependency of Isle of Man from 7 to 13 September 2011. Their {{participation}} marked their second Commonwealth Youth Games appearance. The delegation of Tonga consisted of three officials and four competitors (two men <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>women)</b> participating in three different sports— athletics, boxing and swimming. This was {{a decrease in the}} number of athletes from the nation's last appearance at the Games, when nine athletes were sent to the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games in Pune. Heamasi Sekona won a bronze in the light heavyweight class of boxing without winning a single bout. Sekona was the only medalist from Tongan side. None of the rest three athletes advanced past the qualifying stages, and thus did not win any medals. Katiloka ranked eighth overall in the qualifying round for triple jump; middleweight boxer, Pomale, lost to Cody Crowley of Canada in his first round match. Additionally, Prescott ranked 18th and 13th in the heat rounds of 50m and 100m backstroke events respectively. Sekona's was the first medal for Tonga in the history of the Games.|$|E
