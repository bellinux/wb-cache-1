5|$|A {{magnetostrictive}} material is one which changes shape when {{a magnetic field}} is applied. In reverse, it produces a magnetic field when distorted. The magnetostrictive transducer requires a coil of conducting wire around the {{magnetostrictive material}}. The coil either induces a magnetic field in the transducer <b>and</b> <b>sets</b> <b>it</b> in motion or else picks up an induced current from {{the motion of the}} transducer at the filter output. It is also usually necessary to have a small magnet to bias the magnetostrictive material into its operating range. It is possible to dispense with the magnets if the biasing is taken care of on the electronic side by providing a d.c. current superimposed on the signal, but this approach would detract from the generality of the filter design.|$|E
5|$|While in the {{car with}} Mace, Lenny plays the disc the contact gave him and watches Iris being brutally raped and murdered by an {{attacker}} at the Sunset Regent hotel. As they approach the hotel, Iris is taken out on a stretcher. The next day, Lenny and Mace take the disc to Tick, who cannot identify the source of the recording, but recalls that Iris was looking for Lenny. Mace deduces that Iris may have left something in Lenny's car, and the two go to the impound and find Iris's disc. Steckler and Engleman appear and demand the disc at gunpoint, but Lenny and Mace escape in her car before being forced to stop at a dock. Steckler pours gasoline on the car <b>and</b> <b>sets</b> <b>it</b> on fire, but Mace drives it into the harbor, extinguishing the flames. When they reach the surface, the cops have left.|$|E

5|$|Other {{scientists}} {{working for}} Davros, now {{aware of his}} plans, free the Doctor and give him enough time to rig the Dalek incubation room with explosives which would end {{the threat of the}} Daleks. As he is about to touch the two exposed wire ends to set them off, the Doctor questions if he has the right to make that decision and forgoes setting the explosions off. Just then, he learns that Davros has agreed to stop and allow the Kaled leaders to vote on the continuation of the project. As the leaders gather for this vote, the Doctor is able to recover the Time Ring and destroy the recordings he made, while learning that the Thals and Mutos have prepared the means to destroy the bunker. As the vote is called, Davros reveals this was all a decoy, giving the Daleks he sent to the Thal time to return to the bunker and exterminate the remaining Kaleds. Harry and Sarah escape the chaos, while the Doctor returns to set off the incubator room's explosives, but a Dalek inadvertently completes the circuit <b>and</b> <b>sets</b> <b>it</b> off itself. The Doctor escapes in time before the Thal and Mutos' bomb caves in the bunker, trapping Davros and the Daleks. Inside, Davros realises the Daleks have gained a will of their own, and attempts to stop the production line, but a Dalek incapacitates him.|$|E

Balkan performs his summoning ritual: he arranges the engravings on a makeshift altar, and recites a series of phrases related to each of the nine engravings. Balkan then douses the floor and himself with gasoline <b>and</b> <b>sets</b> <b>it</b> alight, believing himself to be immune to suffering. Balkan's invocation fails, and he screams in pain as the flames engulf him. Corso frees himself, shoots Balkan, takes the engravings, and escapes.|$|E
25|$|In Boccaccio's Decameron a memorably morbid tale (novella V) {{tells of}} Lisabetta, whose {{brothers}} slay her lover. He appears {{to her in}} a dream and shows her where he is buried. She secretly disinters the head, <b>and</b> <b>sets</b> <b>it</b> in a pot of basil, which she waters with her daily tears. Shortly after the pot is taken from her by her brothers, she dies of grief. Boccaccio's tale is the source of John Keats' poem Isabella or The Pot of Basil â€“ which in turn inspired the paintings Isabella (Millais painting) and Isabella and the Pot of Basil. A similar story is told of the Longobard queen, Rosalind.|$|E

25|$|Tailchaser's Song begins, after quoting {{a poem by}} Christopher Smart, with an {{exposition}} of the central elements of the cats' mythology, starting with a creation myth. This both frames the further developments of cat mythology and culture throughout the story and provides necessary backstory for the novel itself. Meerclar Allmother is identified as the primordial creator of all other beings, who brought forth a pair of cats who are the progenitors of the entire species as well as divine figures. Harar Goldeneye is the male, and Fela Skydancer the female. The first litter of this pair are also divine. These three cats are called the Firstborn; the middle child, Grizraz Hearteater, raises a monstrous hound out of jealousy <b>and</b> <b>sets</b> <b>it</b> to attack all cats. The eldest of the three, Viror Whitewind, slays the creature but is himself mortally wounded. Hearteater is driven out and flees beneath the ground where he searches out arcane lore, while Whitewind's death causes his father to flee to the heavens after searching for Hearteater in a murderous rage and causes his mother to be silent {{for the rest of}} his life. His youngest brother, Tangaloor Firefoot, renounced his claim to the throne and fled from the court out of grief. As a result of a further encounter with Firefoot, Hearteater is blinded by sun after having spent so much time beneath the earth, and retreats back beneath the ground, where it is supposed that he plots further destruction.|$|E

As a storm gathers, a depressed Mowgli encounters a group of friendly vultures who accept Mowgli as a fellow outcast. Shere Khan appears shortly after, scaring off the vultures and confronting Mowgli. Baloo rushes to the rescue and tries to keep Shere Khan away from Mowgli, but is injured. [...] When lightning strikes a nearby tree <b>and</b> <b>sets</b> <b>it</b> ablaze, the vultures swoop in to distract Shere Khan while Mowgli gathers flaming branches and ties them to Shere Khan's tail.

[...] Johnson's irregular measures are also standardized to typical twelve-bar sections in which the Iâ€“IVâ€“V blues progression is clearly stated. [...] Clapton does not adapt Johnson's slide guitar technique or open tuning; instead he follows the electric guitar soloing approach of B.B. King and Albert King. [...] However, he employs a Johnson guitar innovation, the duple shuffle pattern or boogie bass line, while singing (Johnson only used it for two bars in [...] "Cross Road Blues").|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} of reviewers perceived the early episodes of Madlax as boring and too slow-paced, {{but some of}} the same critics later remarked that the prolonged exposition is crucial to the unusual finale of the series, which fully establishes the series' own identity <b>and</b> <b>sets</b> <b>it</b> apart from other works. According to them, after the initial volume, the story gets better and better with every new episode, though some have been dissatisfied with its [...] "pseudo-existentialistic" [...] ending. Erica Friedman, the president of Yuricon, highly praised Kuroda's script, naming it [...] "the best writing that Bee Train has done". Professional reviewers welcomed the increased number of sympathetic characters, especially the distinguishable male ones (Friday, Carrossea, Colonel Burton), as opposed to stormtrooper-like operatives of Soldats in Noir, but the female character designs were still said to be much more detailed (to the point of fanservice in the case of Madlax) than the more generic male characters.|$|E

While Gary {{initially}} thwarted her attempts, he eventually gave in and had a full-fledged affair with her. Actress Joan Van Ark, who played Val, said: [...] "I went in way early, whenever Donna Mills came on the show, and told David Jacobs that it made total sense that Gary would fall for Abby. Because they were celebrating Donna Mills and she became the center I canâ€™t believe I did that but it really provided us with some great stories. And it was the longest running story on the show." [...] Dan Lewis of the Sarasota Journal said, [...] "In a recent episode, Abby lures Gary Ewing into an affair, <b>and</b> <b>sets</b> <b>it</b> up so that his wife will discover it. After she completed the scene, Miss Mills recalls, the crew hissing at her â€“ jokingly, of course." [...] The character was known for her numerous rivalries with other female characters, such as Paige and Karen.

Scott Holleran of Box Office Mojo reviewed the song as a [...] "triumphant tune", writing that listening to Benson [...] "belt it out takes one's breath away." [...] Holleran continued to write that the song [...] "captures the buoyant idealism that drives this mythical tale <b>and</b> <b>sets</b> <b>it</b> sailing." [...] Sputnikmusic opined that Benson sings the song both brilliantly and convincingly. Filmtracks.com described [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as a [...] "gorgeous ballad" [...] while describing Benson's performance as [...] "tender enough to be believable ... while also accurately resonating at the necessary high ranges." [...] The New York Daily News Kathleen Carroll called Benson's voice [...] "exceptionally lovely", while Variety wrote that the singer [...] "exhibits a show-stopping set of pipes" [...] during [...] "Part of Your World". Writing for The Morton Report, Chaz Lipp agreed that Benson's performance is [...] "positively charming".|$|E

The mob douses the building with gasoline <b>and</b> <b>sets</b> <b>it</b> on fire, burning Krueger alive. While his body dies, his spirit lives on in the dreams of a group of teenagers living in his old neighborhood, whom he preys on by entering their dreams and killing them. He is apparently destroyed {{at the end of the}} film by protagonist Nancy Thompson, but the last scene reveals that he had survived. He went on to antagonize the teenage protagonists of the next five films in the series. After a hiatus, Krueger was brought back in Wes Craven's New Nightmare by Wes Craven, who had not worked on the film series since the third film, [...] Robert Englund, who portrayed Krueger throughout the film series and its television spin-off, also took the role as a fictional version of himself in New Nightmare; it is implied that Englund was stalked by his character, who is ancient demonic entity that took on the form of Wes Craven's creation, and has come to life from the film franchise's fictitious world. Englund struggles to keep his sanity intact from Krueger's torments, and went into hiding with his family. This embodiment of Freddy Krueger also sees Heather Langenkamp as his primary foe as the result of her character Nancy Thompson was the first who defeated him in the first film.|$|E
