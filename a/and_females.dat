40|$|This {{study is}} a sociolinguistic study about request made by male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> {{employer}} to the male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees <b>and</b> also male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees to male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers. The writer is interested in investigating request since request can be used differently by both employers and employees. She also wants to know the types of request used by the male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employer to the male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees <b>and</b> male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees to male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers. The writer used Ervin-Tripp?s theory of request as the main theory to classify the types of request. To find {{the most frequently used}} types of request used by both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers <b>and</b> both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees, the writer used descriptive quantitative approach. The writer found that both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers mostly used the same types of request expressions to both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees. However, the writer found various types of request used by both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees to both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers. The result of this research showed that both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers mostly used bald imperatives as their types of request, both to their male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees. However, both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees used various types of request, both to male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employer. Thus, the result might prove that the social status and gender may have influenced the types of request made by both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers <b>and</b> both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees...|$|R

5|$|A {{key part}} of the Recovery Plan is the {{supplementary}} feeding of females. The kakapo breeds only once every two to five years, when a certain type of plant species, primarily Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu), produces protein-rich fruit and seeds. Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant's mast year help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase kakapo breeding frequency. In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, sweet potatoes, almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds and walnuts) were supplied ad libitum each night to 12 feeding stations. Males <b>and</b> <b>females</b> ate the supplied foods, <b>and</b> <b>females</b> nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989–91 {{for the first time since}} 1982, although nesting success was low.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} three {{different}} European populations showed a mean clutch size of 3.6 eggs, producing 2.6 chicks, of which 1.9 fledged. Adult survival rate varied from 83 to 92%, with no significant difference detected between males <b>and</b> <b>females.</b> Survival of first-year birds was, at 77%, {{lower than that of}} adults. The availability or otherwise of human food supplied from tourist activities did not affect breeding success.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other insects, P.exclamans use sexual pheromones to attract members of the {{opposite}} sex. Researchers have attempted to determine the exact role that sexual pheromones play in sexual attraction in paper wasps. They set up a wind tunnel where males <b>and</b> <b>females</b> were exposed to a sexual pheromone wick that was isolated from males <b>and</b> <b>females.</b> These pheromones were taken by hexane extracts from wholes bodies and thoraces of unmated females. The male extracts {{were taken from the}} ectal mandibular and seventh sternal glands. It was found that the opposite sex was attracted upwind of the scent and the results were intensified when a fan was turned on. The range of the scent was found to be around 2 metres.|$|E

5|$|Both {{the males}} <b>and</b> <b>females</b> become sexually mature {{by the time}} they are a year-and-a-half old. However, males {{actually}} mate after the age of four to five years. Males <b>and</b> <b>females</b> are most reproductive till the age of 14 and 14–18 years, respectively, with the maximum age of successful lactation in females being 13–14 years. With no fixed breeding season; births may occur at any time of the year. A study at Dvůr Králové Zoo (Czech Republic) showed that 55% of the births occurred between September and December. A rutting male tests the urine of any female he encounters, to which the female responds by urinating. Having located a female in estrus, the male follows her closely, trying to rub his cheek on her rump, head, neck, and chest. He performs gasping movements with his lips. Finally, the male mounts the female, resting his head and neck on her back, in a similar way as other tragelaphines.|$|E
