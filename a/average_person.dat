5|$|In October 2011, at the 24th CGPM {{proposals}} {{were made to}} change the definitions of four of the base units. These changes should not affect the <b>average</b> <b>person.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{ratio of}} carboxy{{hemoglobin}} to hemoglobin molecules in an <b>average</b> <b>person</b> may {{be up to}} 5%, although cigarette smokers who smoke two packs per day may have levels up to 9%. In symptomatic poisoned people they are often in the 10–30% range, while persons who die may have postmortem blood levels of 30–90%.|$|E
5|$|Eumenorrhea denotes normal, regular {{menstruation}} {{that lasts}} {{for a few}} days (usually 3 to 5 days, but anywhere from 2 to 7 days is considered normal). The average blood loss during menstruation is 35 milliliters with 10–80 ml considered normal. Women who experience Menorrhagia are more susceptible to iron deficiency than the <b>average</b> <b>person.</b> An enzyme called plasmin inhibits clotting in the menstrual fluid.|$|E
50|$|There were 9,505 {{household}}s. The <b>average</b> <b>persons</b> {{living in}} a household was 2.31. The home ownership rate was 73.8%. The median value of owner-occupied units was $97,600. There were 12,484 housing units.|$|R
50|$|AQH is an {{abbreviation}} for <b>Average</b> Quarter-Hour <b>Persons</b> (AQH Persons).The <b>average</b> number of <b>persons</b> {{listening to a}} particular station {{for at least five}} minutes during a 15-minute period.|$|R
50|$|AQH is an {{abbreviation}} for <b>Average</b> Quarter-Hour <b>Persons</b> (AQH Persons), defined by Arbitron (now {{referred to as}} Nielsen Audio) as the <b>average</b> number of <b>persons</b> listening to a particular station {{for at least five}} minutes during a 15-minute period.|$|R
5|$|Longyearbyen {{experiences}} {{a very high}} turnover; in 2008, 427 people (23 percent) {{moved away from the}} town. The <b>average</b> <b>person</b> lived in Longyearbyen for 6.3 years, although it is 6.6 years for Norwegians and 4.3 years for foreigners. In 2009, {{about a quarter of the}} population had lived in the town since before 2000, and can thus be regarded as permanent population. The longest residing people tend to work in the mining industry, followed by local government employees. The shortest tenures are held by students and employees in higher education, tourism and the state.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s {{also saw}} the birth of Cyc, the first attempt to attack the commonsense {{knowledge}} problem directly, by creating a massive database that would contain all the mundane facts that the <b>average</b> <b>person</b> knows. Douglas Lenat, who started and led the project, argued {{that there is no}} shortcut ― the only way for machines to know the meaning of human concepts is to teach them, one concept at a time, by hand. The project was not expected to be completed for many decades.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequently}} used argument in favour of dualism appeals to the common-sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter. If asked what the mind is, the <b>average</b> <b>person</b> would usually respond by identifying it with their self, their personality, their soul, or some other such entity. They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding {{the idea that there}} is just one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible. Many modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are misleading and that we should use our critical faculties, along with empirical evidence from the sciences, to examine these assumptions to determine whether there is any real basis to them.|$|E
50|$|Most of Idrus' {{characters}} were <b>average</b> <b>persons,</b> {{as opposed to}} nobility found in works by earlier authors such as Amir Hamzah. This is caused {{in part by the}} political motivations of the Japanese occupation government, which ruled from 1942 until mid-1945; the Japanese found it necessary to promote the rights of the masses to maintain control.|$|R
50|$|The overall {{population}} density is low, although pockets of overpopulation exist. Papua New Guinea's Western Province <b>averages</b> one <b>person</b> per square kilometer (3 per sq. mi.). The Simbu Province in the New Guinea highlands <b>averages</b> 20 <b>persons</b> per square kilometer (60 per sq. mi.) and has areas containing up to 200 people farming a square kilometer of land. The highlands have 40% of the population.|$|R

5|$|Victor Fresco, the show's creator, has cited {{his being}} a new parent as {{inspiration}} for the show. In an interview with NPR, he discussed how having a kid piqued his interest to develop a show about the disconnection between a person's public and personal lives, such as how parents teach their kids to be moral, yet work for giant corporations. According to Fresco, Ted Crisp is the single father and his daughter serves as his moral compass. Fresco stated that since he's worked for a few giant companies, he didn't base Veridian Dynamics on any specific corporation. The show's name {{was based on the}} idea that a person is better off if they are Ted, that essentially the <b>average</b> <b>person</b> wants to be Ted. Fresco has stated that he wasn't a fan of the show's title, but hadn't spoken of changing it.|$|E
5|$|In humans, sodium is an {{essential}} mineral that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day. Sodium chloride is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative in such commodities as pickled preserves and jerky; for Americans, most sodium chloride comes from processed foods. Other sources of sodium are its natural occurrence in food and such food additives as monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium nitrite, sodium saccharin, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), and sodium benzoate. The US Institute of Medicine set its Tolerable Upper Intake Level for sodium at 2.3grams per day, but the <b>average</b> <b>person</b> in the United States consumes 3.4grams per day. Studies have found that lowering sodium intake by 2g per day tends to lower systolic blood pressure by about two to four mmHg. It {{has been estimated that}} such a decrease in sodium intake would lead to between 9 and 17% fewer cases of hypertension.|$|E
5|$|In {{economic}} and environmental fields, the term decoupling is becoming increasingly used {{in the context of}} economic production and environmental quality. When used in this way, it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without incurring corresponding increases in environmental pressure. Ecological economics includes the study of societal metabolism, the throughput of resources that enter and exit the economic system in relation to environmental quality. An economy that is able to sustain GDP growth without having a negative impact on the environment is said to be decoupled. Exactly how, if, or to what extent this can be achieved is a subject of much debate. In 2011 the International Resource Panel, hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), warned that by 2050 the human race could be devouring 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year—three times its current rate of consumption—unless nations can make serious attempts at decoupling. The report noted that citizens of developed countries consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita per annum (ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries). By comparison, the <b>average</b> <b>person</b> in India today consumes four tons per year. Sustainability studies analyse ways to reduce resource intensity (the amount of resource (e.g. water, energy, or materials) needed for the production, consumption and disposal of a unit of good or service) whether this be achieved from improved economic management, product design, or new technology.|$|E
5000|$|Flow of {{the lymph}} in the {{thoracic}} duct in an <b>average</b> resting <b>person</b> usually approximates 100ml per hour. Accompanied by another ~25ml per hour in other lymph vessels, total lymph {{flow in the}} body is about 4 to 5 liters per day. This can be elevated several folds while exercising. Thus it can be estimated that without lymphatic flow, an <b>average</b> resting <b>person</b> would die within 24 hours.|$|R

50|$|Emotional mental {{illnesses}} {{should be a}} particular concern in the United States since the U.S. has the highest annual prevalence rates (26 percent) for {{mental illnesses}} among a comparison of 14 developing and developed countries. While approximately 80 percent of all people in the United States with a mental disorder eventually receive some form of treatment, on the <b>average</b> <b>persons</b> do not access care until nearly a decade following {{the development of their}} illness, and less than one-third of people who seek help receive minimally adequate care.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—USA Census {{data from}} 2000 {{is used to}} {{estimate}} the white space available for cognitive radios in TV bands in the continental USA. The FCC’s November 2008 ruling is analyzed to show there are roughly nine white-space channels available on <b>average</b> per <b>person</b> given the currently active television stations. The analysis also demonstrates the conservatism of fixed threshold sensing rules for white-space detection — the- 114 dBm rule for sensing ATSC signals is expected to recover less than one white-space channel on <b>average</b> per <b>person.</b> I...|$|R

[...] This observation made in 1887 counts for 220 {{people living in}} 49 houses {{in an area of}} 1241 acres meaning an average of around 5 persons in each household. This is very different to the <b>average</b> <b>persons</b> per household data from the 2011 census which states a total 150 dwellings for a population of 342 giving an average of just over 2 persons per household.|$|R
