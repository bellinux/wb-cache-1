500|$|On 23 July, the {{day after}} leaving the camp, Nansen had the first indisputable glimpse of land. He wrote: [...] "At last the marvel has come to pass—land, land, <b>and</b> <b>after</b> <b>we</b> had almost given up our belief in it!" [...] In the {{succeeding}} days the pair struggled towards this land, which seemingly grew no nearer, although {{by the end of}} July they could hear the distant sound of breaking surf. On 4 August they survived a polar bear attack; two days later they reached the edge of the ice, and only water lay between them and the land. On 6 August they shot the last two Samoyed dogs, converted the kayaks into a catamaran by lashing sledges and skis across them, and raised a sail.|$|E
500|$|Timberlake was {{impressed}} by the amount of recording material Madonna would already have ready. He said that he does not normally write down his lyrics, since the ideas come faster to him, but Madonna had [...] "all these thoughts, riddles, poems, feelings, all written in huge notebooks ... she kept handing them over. It was amazing, taking these little bits here and there and putting them together like a puzzle." [...] For recording [...] "Miles Away", Timberlake played a guitar riff for Madonna and asked [...] "How do we want to do this? What do {{we want it to be}} about? What do we want to say?" [...] Madonna decided to have discussions between herself and Timberlake to develop other ideas for the songs. One of the ideas they connected on was the universality of long-distance relationships, which they felt was too personal for them, but nevertheless used the concept in [...] "Miles Away". Madonna commented on the recorded version: [...] "We put our stuff out there. [...] <b>And</b> <b>after</b> <b>we</b> did the song, everybody in the studio was like, 'Oh, I can relate to that.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} April they {{observed}} the tracks of an Arctic fox, the first trace they had seen of a living creature other than their dogs since leaving Fram. Soon they began to see bear tracks, {{and by the end}} of May seals, gulls and whales were in evidence. On 31 May, by Nansen's calculations, they were only [...] from Cape Fligely, the northernmost known point of Franz Josef Land. However, travel conditions worsened as the warmer weather caused the ice to break up. On 22 June the pair decided to rest on a stable ice floe while they repaired their equipment and gathered their strength for the next stage of their journey. They remained on the floe for a month. The day after leaving this camp Nansen recorded: [...] "At last the marvel has come to pass—land, land, <b>and</b> <b>after</b> <b>we</b> had almost given up our belief in it!" [...] Whether this still-distant land was Franz Josef Land or a new discovery they did not know—they had only a rough sketch map to guide them. On 6 August they reached the edge of the ice, where they shot the last of their dogs—they had been killing the weakest regularly since 24 April, to feed the others. They then lashed their two kayaks together, raised a sail and made for the land.|$|E

5000|$|In 2015, GoldLink {{released}} his second mixtape, <b>And</b> <b>After</b> That, <b>We</b> Didn't Talk on Soulection to critical acclaims. In 2016, {{it was announced}} that GoldLink had signed a major deal with RCA Records. To celebrate him signing to RCA, GoldLink and Soulection released a remixed version of <b>And</b> <b>After</b> That, <b>We</b> Didn't Talk. Later that year, he {{released his}} new single [...] "Fall In Love" [...] featuring fellow DC rapper and close friend Cisero, produced by BADBADNOTGOOD and Kaytranada.|$|R
2500|$|The {{piece is}} a {{meditation}} on death. Pärt's biographer, Paul Hillier, suggests that [...] "how we live depends on our relationship with death: how we make music depends on our relationship to silence." [...] It is significant that the piece begins and ends with silence—that the silence is written in the score. This silence creates a frame around the piece and has spiritual significance. It suggests that we come from silence, and return to silence; it reminds us that before we were born <b>and</b> <b>after</b> <b>we</b> die we are silent {{with respect to this}} world.|$|E
2500|$|The Israeli-Palestinian conflict, however, {{has been}} found to have {{negative}} impacts on children's health and medical care. A 2007 study found that stress from the violence in years prior has led to sharply increased levels of alcohol consumption, smoking, and substance abuse among Israeli adolescents. It stated, in part, that [...] "Close physical exposure to acts of terrorism was positively associated with higher levels of alcohol consumption, binge drinking, and cannabis that were significant before <b>and</b> <b>after</b> <b>we</b> controlled for PTSS and depression." [...] The study concluded that there is a high risk of future health complications {{as a result of these}} behaviors.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{one week}} before {{recording}} was due to start, a dearth of material became apparent: [...] "I had four songs written, because {{that was all the}} lyrics I had from Graham. And I realized I wasn't getting any more words out of him. So I had to write a song a day so there was enough. Graham came with a couple of things, {{but there was no way}} he would come with enough songs to fill out the rest of the record. So I took an instant editorial decision that was what was going to happen. Some of those words stayed, and some of those words got worked on by Graham and me. That was it, basically." [...] The band worked on more than a dozen songs, dropping those that were not [...] "working quite well enough". Many of the songs were recorded in a single take, the band playing as a threesome: [...] "You have to understand, as a three-piece, we'd very rarely played together. [...] So [...] I thought, 'Let's see how it goes in the studio.' We worked with an engineer that we'd never worked with before, who was Irish. We did 'Moreover,' <b>and</b> <b>after</b> <b>we</b> were done playing, he came in and said, 'You make a big fookin' noise for three.'" [...] The band felt vindicated.|$|E
