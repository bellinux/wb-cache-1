25|$|Amulya Malladi's 2002 novel <b>A</b> <b>Breath</b> <b>of</b> Fresh Air {{relates the}} story of a mother and son who develop health issues as a result of {{exposure}} to gas at Bhopal. The book is based on Malladi's recollections of Bhopal during the incident.|$|E
25|$|During {{the time}} Burial was released, Extol was {{described}} as Norway's second best band by the Norwegian magazine Scream.

25|$|Adjectives {{with the}} very common -sk ending are special. If they are polysyllabic or refer to a country, {{geographic}} area or ethnic group, they never take -t. Et klassisk stykke (a classical piece), et svensk hus (a Swedish house). Otherwise the -t is optional. Et friskt pust, or et frisk pust (<b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> fresh air).|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, Thomas Midgley, Jr. {{improved}} {{the process of}} synthesis and led the effort to use CFC as refrigerant to replace ammonia (NH3), chloromethane (CH3Cl), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), which are toxic but were in common use. In searching for a new refrigerant, requirements for the compound were: low boiling point, low toxicity, and to be generally non-reactive. In a demonstration for the American Chemical Society, Midgley flamboyantly demonstrated all these properties by inhaling <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> the gas and using it to blow out a candle in 1930.|$|E
25|$|Seal: Depending on the season, Inuit {{hunt for}} {{different}} types of seal: harp seal, harbour seal, and bearded seal. Ringed seals are hunted all year, while harp seals are only available during the summer. Because seals need {{to break through the}} ice to reach air, they form breathing holes with their teeth and claws. Through these, Inuit hunters are able to capture seals. When a hunter arrives at these holes, they set up a seal indicator that alerts the hunter when a seal is coming up for <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> air. When the seal comes up, the hunter notices movement in the indicator and uses his harpoon to capture the seal in the water.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile Valdobrev {{attended}} the High School for Foreign Languages in Stara Zagora. For a Communist country behind the Iron Curtain which Bulgaria {{was at that}} time, this school was like <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> fresh air – with a discipline not so strict and teachers being lenient and having a personal approach {{to each of the}} students. They soon noticed Valdobrev's wandering mind and lack of concentration in class and created a system which tried to help him study the English language better. They gave him constant tasks to listen to and write down lyrics of new songs, perform them with his guitar in the lessons and translate the words for his classmates. These everyday concerts were the real productive education for him and later, when he was traveling over the Black Sea resorts and Germany as a street musician, he already had a set-list of 300 prepared and well-rehearsed world hit songs of any genre.|$|E
25|$|A {{demand valve}} detects when the diver starts inhaling and {{supplies}} the diver with <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> gas at ambient pressure. This {{is done by}} a mechanical system linking a pressure differential sensor (diaphragm) to a valve which is opened to an extent proportional to the displacement of the diaphragm difference. The pressure difference between {{the inside of the}} mouthpiece and the ambient pressure outside the diaphragm required to open the valve is known as the cracking pressure. This cracking pressure difference is usually negative but may be slightly positive on a positive pressure regulator (a regulator that maintains a pressure inside the mouthpiece, mask or helmet, which is slightly greater than the ambient pressure). Once the valve has opened, gas flow should continue at the smallest stable pressure difference reasonably practicable while the diver inhales, and should stop as soon as gas flow stops. Several mechanisms have been devised to provide this function, some of them extremely simple and robust, and others somewhat more complex, but more sensitive to small pressure changes.|$|E
25|$|USNS Courier (MARAD hull AK-5019) was a {{cargo ship}} of the National Defense Reserve Fleet. The cargo ship {{was built by}} Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock, Chester, Pennsylvania, {{at the request of}} the US Maritime Administration (MARAD hull 124) in 1962. The ship was 470 ft in length and has <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> 73 and weighs 11420 tons, empty. The ship was {{originally}} administered by American Export Lines under the civilian name SS Export Courier and eventually became part of the James River Reserve Fleet. The company ran into financial trouble in 1977. Before 1981, Farrell Lines, which took over parts of the dissolved American Export Lines, transferred administration of the Courier to the Military Sealift Command, which renamed the ship USNS Courier. The ship was officially accepted as part of the Maritime Administration in February 1983. From 1981 it was stationed with the Beaumont Reserve Fleet or docked at Port Neches, Beaumont Texas. Service records indicate repairs after Operation Desert Storm. In 2001 the ship was transferred to the National Defense Reserve Fleet and remained in this status until July 2008 when it was sold to Southern Scrap Metal Corporation of New Orleans, Louisiana and subsequently transferred to New Orleans' Industrial Canal on 13 August, a little more than two weeks before Hurricane Gustav reached Louisiana's southeastern coast.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{its release}} in the United States Variety praised {{the film as}} an [...] "extravagant piece of science fiction.

According to Hallenbeck, many US critics found Brian Donlevy's gruff Quatermass <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> fresh air from the earnest hero scientists of American science fiction films, such as Gene Barry's character in War of the Worlds.|$|E

500|$|Released on November 16, 2012, Omen {{was well}} {{received}} by music critics. They highlighted the drumming on the album, remarking on how Børven {{was able to}} match the skill and intensity of Blomberg. Steven Ecott of Cross Rhythms praised the drumming, guitar work, and harsh vocals. He concluded that [...] "'Omen' is <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> fresh air in the rather stale and stuffy room that black metal finds itself resting." [...] Scott Waters of HM wrote that [...] "the musicianship is beyond reproach. To simply play that fast and accurate, even for four-minute spurts, requires more than just talent. It requires skill and endurance. Much of the music on Omen display that skill and endurance and definitely accomplishes what it set out to do." ...|$|E

[...] Ben Ratliff of The New York Times described the album as possessing [...] "a kind of demented gravity, and the music bears it out: {{it is the most}} concentrated, focused Slayer record in 20 years." [...] PopMatters critic Adrien Begrand called it [...] "Slayer's best album in sixteen years and their most thought-provoking work to date", and the album was placed at number 15 on PopMatters' list of The Best Metal Albums of 2006.|$|E
500|$|The 19th-century Welsh {{antiquarian}} Angharad Llwyd {{described the}} church as a [...] "spacious handsome structure", and Samuel Lewis (a writer of topographical guides in the 19th century) described the church in very similar words as a [...] "spacious and handsome structure"; he particularly noted the [...] "lofty square embattled tower crowned with pinnacles." [...] A 2009 guide to the buildings of north Wales describes the 19th-century alterations by Kennedy as [...] "egregious", but says that the interior [...] "possesses considerable grace", with the columns of the arcades being [...] "touched by <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> classicism". A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey describes it as [...] "a good example of a tastefully restored church", and a [...] "spacious, high sided building with an impressive tower". It also comments that its shape is not typical of churches on the island.|$|E
500|$|On 20 January 1948, Mackenzie King {{announced}} his intent to resign. He also announced a Cabinet reshuffle; both St. Laurent and Howe had urged the Prime Minister to move Howe, {{who had not}} enjoyed {{his work at the}} Ministry of Reconstruction and Supply. Mackenzie King finally yielded, moving James Angus MacKinnon, the Minister of Trade and Commerce to open his place for Howe (the Albertan became Minister of Fisheries). [...] Howe publicly announced that he was [...] "not available" [...] to stand for the leadership, and that he was supporting St. Laurent. The Quebecer was elected Leader of the Liberal Party in August, and Mackenzie King finally resigned on 15 November. [...] At age66, St. Laurent was only seven years younger than Mackenzie King, but was nevertheless seen as <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> fresh air—except at Cabinet meetings, where he reversed Mackenzie King's smoking ban.|$|E
