5|$|<b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> the Emperor's {{confirmation}} of his directorship, Mahler shared duties as a resident conductor with Joseph Hellmesberger Jr. (son {{of the former}} conservatory director) and Hans Richter, an internationally renowned interpreter of Wagner and the conductor of the original Ring cycle at Bayreuth in 1876. Director Wilhelm Jahn had not consulted Richter about Mahler's appointment; Mahler, sensitive to the situation, wrote Richter a complimentary letter expressing unswerving admiration for the older conductor. Subsequently, the two were rarely in agreement, but kept their divisions private.|$|E
25|$|Bevins came to {{prominence}} aged 18 in August 1985, when he captained, and kept wicket for, the Warwickshire Young Amateurs team which beat Lancashire Federation Under-19s {{to win the}} 1985 Oxford and Cambridge Festival. He dismissed three players, and two whom he stumped were {{to go on to}} have long careers in the game: future England captain Mike Atherton and Nick Speak. By 1987, Bevins was a regular in Worcestershire's second team, and that continued the following season <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> his break.|$|E
25|$|Voigt {{rode the}} 2004 Tour de France for Team CSC captain Ivan Basso. Voigt and team mate Jakob Piil were often in breakaways, {{covering}} the break for CSC. On the 15th stage, Voigt {{was in a}} break as Ullrich attacked up the Col de l'Echarasson, leaving race leader Lance Armstrong and second-placed Basso. With Armstrong's team unable to pull Ullrich back in, Voigt was ordered back from his breakaway to help Basso defend his place. Voigt saw Ullrich ride past <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> his captain, before he single-handedly closed the gap to Ullrich. Next day was a time trial up the Alpe d'Huez with 900,000 spectators at the roadside. Voigt was heckled by German fans calling him Judas for his effort to ruin fellow German Ullrich's chances. Voigt criticised German TV-channel ARD for starting a witch-hunt against him and pleaded that he was paid by Team CSC, not Germany and that (as he stated in the documentary Overcoming) thanks to his help, Ullrich won his olympic gold medal in 2000.|$|E

25|$|At 11:15 that morning, Fred {{formally}} {{admitted to}} police he had indeed killed his daughter, albeit {{in an act}} of manslaughter. He confessed to strangling Heather in a fit of rage before dismembering her body in the ground floor bathroom with a heavy serrated knife he normally used for cutting slabs of frozen meat. Her remains had been stored in a dustbin <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> an opportunity to dig her grave. Fred was insistent his wife had no knowledge of her daughter's murder, claiming he had committed this murder as Rose was preoccupied with one of her clients, adding the fact the search team had not yet unearthed Heather's remains was because they had been excavating the wrong section of his garden. He then volunteered to accompany police to the house to pinpoint the precise location of Heather's body. Upon receipt of this confession, Fred's solicitor, Howard Ogden, and his appointed appropriate adult, Janet Leach, informed Mae and Stephen their father had confessed to their sister's murder. In response, Stephen slumped against a wall and began sobbing; Mae entered a state of shock, before stammering that her father had not killed her sister.|$|E
500|$|The cholera {{epidemic}} reached Mexico City {{within days}} of Austin's arrival, prompting Congress to adjourn before Austin could present the convention's resolutions. [...] <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> the legislature to reconvene, Austin heard rumors that Texians were planning a third convention to unilaterally declare themselves a separate state. [...] Although Austin was also frustrated {{at the lack of}} progress, he disapproved of this drastic proposal. [...] In an attempt to quell the more radical groups in Texas, in October Austin {{sent a letter to the}} ayuntamiento in San Antonio de Béxar in which he proposed that all of the ayuntamientos should jointly form a new state government. In what could be interpreted as an inflammatory gesture, Austin signed his letter [...] "dios y Tejas" [...] ("God and Texas") rather than the traditional Mexican closing [...] "dios y libertad" [...] ("God and liberty"). [...] A few days after he had posted the letter, the immigration ban was repealed, assuaging one of the major Texian concerns.|$|E
500|$|<b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> {{offers of}} {{employment}} through the summer and autumn of 1943, Larkin added more works to the Coleman oeuvre. He began a sequel to Trouble at Willow Gables, set in a women's college at Oxford and entitled Michaelmas Term at St Bride's, but did not finish it: [...] "All literary inspiration has deserted me", he informed Amis on 13 August. Nevertheless, a week later he told Amis that Brunette was helping him to write a novel, provisionally entitled Jill, about [...] "a young man who invents an imaginary sister, and {{falls in love with}} her". With this letter Larkin sent a Coleman poem, [...] "Bliss", the first of seven written in the girls' school idiom. [...] As late as 19 October he reported to Amis that [...] "Brunette is working on a little monograph about girls' school stories". This is a reference to the putative literary manifesto [...] "What Are We Writing For", which became the final Coleman work. Thereafter, Motion records, she disappeared, [...] "to be mentioned only fleetingly in later accounts of his university life... She ended up as an occasional comic reminder of lost youth".|$|E

500|$|Multiple reviewers noted Hundreds {{variety of}} puzzles and endgame difficulty. Edge {{commented that the}} [...] "arcane codes" [...] and puzzles with {{prescribed}} solutions made the game's pacing [...] "unusual" [...] {{when compared to the}} other puzzles designed to be completed leisurely. Slater of Pocket Gamer too felt the pacing was [...] "swift but uninspiring", and Eurogamer Whitehead called its rhythm [...] "weird" [...] <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> the right opportunity some puzzles and could finish others with a single trick. Game Informer Ryckert also found the final puzzles too aggravating, especially the ones with invisible elements. Campbell of TouchArcade appreciated the [...] variety of puzzles from [...] "twitch" [...] to [...] "slow and thoughtful" [...] to, her favorite, the [...] "cerebral" [...] puzzles that required specific tricks as well as the ability to skip puzzles. She also found the last level nigh impossible. Multiple reviewers felt that the cipher puzzles were out of place, and TouchArcade said it was easy to ignore them as what felt like an [...] "utterly distinct" [...] game. The Atlantic Bogost thought that the hidden ciphers were the [...] "surest clue" [...] of its status as [...] "a design object and not a consumable media experience". Slater of Pocket Gamer wrote that the ciphers felt forced and unexciting, and was disappointed overall in consideration of [...] "the incredible talent involved". Whitehead of Eurogamer called the puzzles [...] "deftly constructed" [...] and said the game [...] "delights more than it frustrates". Wired Ryan Rigney wrote that Hundreds distinguished itself among iOS puzzle games in its style and design.|$|E

Strand did not return until morning, and Olsen was getting wetter and colder <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> help. In the end Olsen decided that further help would not come in time and started following Strand's footsteps, but he soon had to give up, having traversed about [...] Three of the four crew at the station returned and transported Olsen to safety.
