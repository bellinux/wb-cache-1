40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two separate but broadly related essays investigating the role of <b>authorized</b> <b>shares</b> in corporate events. In the first essay, I examine the relation between management`s power to issue new shares of stock and stock split abnormal announcement returns. I posit that the mechanical reduction in excess <b>authorized</b> <b>shares</b> (EAS) caused by a stock split, decreases management`s power to issue stock. I argue that this results in lower agency costs and thereby increases shareholder`s value. After controlling for other factors, and consistent with my hypothesis, I find that the pre-split ratio of unissued <b>authorized</b> <b>shares</b> to total outstanding <b>shares</b> (Excess <b>Authorized</b> Ratio-EAR) is positively related to the abnormal stock split announcement returns. My analysis suggests nontrivial economic benefits accrue to shareholders from a reduction in management 2 ̆ 7 s power to issue stock and firms that have a higher pre-split EAR benefit the most. In the second essay, I investigate the role of top-up options granted by target managers to bidders in tender offers. A top-up option enables bidders to bypass target shareholder consent and allows for relatively fast execution of the tender offer. My evidence, from 456 tender offers announced during 2000 - 2012 suggests that deals with top-up options are detrimental to both bidder and target shareholders, when compared to tender offers without the top-up feature. This effect seems to be concentrated in the pre- 2007 period. After 2006 {{a large majority of}} tender offers include top-up options. I also find that the use of top-up options is negatively related to the use of lock-up options in the early period. In the later period of my sample, when lock-up options were no longer used in tender offers, toeholds are negatively related to the use of top-up options. Moreover top-up options increase the speed of deal completion and are associated with less hostility, higher target free cash flows, and higher termination fees. Overall, I conclude that the use of top-up options is most consistent with the anti-competitive hypothesis. ...|$|R

50|$|Because a {{bonus issue}} does not {{represent}} an economic event - no wealth changes hands.

Another difference between a bonus issue and a stock split is that while a stock split usually also splits the company's <b>authorized</b> <b>share</b> capital, the distribution of bonus shares only changes its issued share capital (or even only its outstanding shares).|$|E
