Whitney is left alone and vulnerable, and falls for a man, Rob Grayson, played by Jody Latham, who exploits her for financial gain. EastEnders worked alongside charity Comic Relief on the storyline, which started planning in 2010. The storyline culminated during Red Nose Day 2011 on 19 March 2011, in a special ten-minute episode. Gilly Green, Head of UK Grants at Comic Relief, said: [...] "It is vital that we continue to alert young people to the dangers if we are to stop them being exploited and the opportunity to work with EastEnders will make a huge audience aware of this issue. We have been working with the EastEnders script writers and some of the young women from projects we support to ensure the story reflects the reality of young people caught up in sexual exploitation." [...] Kevin Cahill, Chief Executive of Comic Relief, added [...] "We have worked over many years with EastEnders in <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>ways.</b> It's been a real pleasure this year to work together on a piece of serious drama, in the best traditions of public service, which will highlight an important issue and also, because it occurs on the night of Comic Relief, actually help raise crucial funds to help young women caught up in it." [...] The storyline begins when Bianca is sent to prison and Whitney rejects her family, moving in with Janine and attempting to make money by stealing from The Queen Victoria, causing her to get sacked, working for Max, whom she tries to kiss as she has a crush on him, and pickpocketing. When she is caught, Rob rescues her from the situation and offers her what McGarty called a [...] "dream life", which Whitney thinks is her chance to move up in the world as she feels lonely and has no friends.|$|E

2500|$|The {{theory of}} unequal {{exchange}} talks about exploitation {{in the sphere}} of distribution, in addition to the sphere of production. This is regarded by classical revolutionary orthodox Marxists as a reformist threat to the core orthodox classical revolutionary Marxist principle that exploitation occurs only at the point of production, and that capitalism cannot be made fair through fair trade or redistribution, only abolished by abolishing wage labor. Thus, for example, Paul Cockshott and Allin Cottrell prefer a Ricardian theory of comparative advantage to explain world trade. One Marxist states that [...] "Radicals assume unequal exchange after Ricardo and want the state to intervene to equalize exchange. Marxism critiques both these theories as limited by the level of analysis." [...] According to Marxist theory, exploitation is a grievance of the working class, but according to unequal exchange theory, capitalists can be just as aggrieved about exploitation, in <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>ways,</b> by other competing capitalists or by the state.|$|E

2500|$|If {{the values}} and prices of goods can vary {{independently}} in <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>ways,</b> then the classical revolutionary orthodox Marxist principle that total production prices are equal to total product values cannot, realistically, be true; there exists no causal mechanism by which such price-value fluctuations perfectly compensate each other in aggregate, so that total product values equal total production prices. The principle can then be true only in an abstract theoretical model, but not in reality. Yet, if that classical revolutionary orthodox core principle is not true in reality, then it seems to follow there cannot be any systematic relationship {{in the real world}} between the Marxist labor-values and the actual price-levels for products – which was precisely what critics argued during the 20th century about the insolubility of the transformation problem. If the Marxian product values are really determinants of product-prices, {{is there a way to}} express that relationship, other than as an accounting consolidation, or as a simultaneous input-output equation? There is no consensus about that issue among mathematicians and computer scientists, although the main trend is now toward probabilistic analysis and vector algebra. Many mathematical Marxists have abandoned Marx's analysis of the equalization of the rate of profit and Marx's concept of production prices, arguing that an analysis of input-output data can straightforwardly prove a strong, robust positive correlation between product-prices and employee hours worked. They argue, with Marx, that a uniform profit rate does not exist in reality, but against Marx that, therefore, a tendency for differences in profit rates to be levelled out by competition does not exist either. Since (they argue) the deviation of product-prices from product-values is not very great in reality, the law of value is an empirical law with predictive power. At least for output aggregates, this is quite easy to prove, since net value-added (gross labour compensation earned and paid + gross profits earned and paid, net of write-offs) is by definition strongly correlated with the total amount of labour hours worked. [...] This analysis does not, however, refer to foreign trade.|$|E

How might one address those less remarked-upon, extra-‘ordinary’ lived moments of credit and debt: moments that can come, when all is added up, to say much more about the weight of the day-to-day and, thus, offer – by their very intimacy – the surest potential for their own transformation? Encounters between the monetary and the mundane transpire in <b>all</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>ways,</b> through <b>all</b> manner of instruments/practices, arrangements/assemblages, moralities/affects, rhythms/routines and across vastly different contexts and registers (familial, communal, gendered, racial, national, global, etc.). We argue that only by adhering closely to the empirical contents of one's immediate situation, as always crossed by the abstractions of theory, does it become possible to grasp in all its temporal and scalar diversity the ‘big picture’, a totality that might begin to unite these fragments and moments that otherwise escape continuously into the background. Our contributors speak from out of very specific sets of circumstances, histories and intimacies: with essays that take the reader into the decision-making practices at Portuguese retail banks, the mortgage worries of residents in new-build homes in Warsaw Poland, American military families and their struggles with debt management, the lives of mamapreneurs working a ‘fourth shift’, the tactical use of credit and debt in the slums of Buenos Aires, the bookkeeping practices of merchants in a Russian small town, the troubling subterranean history of today's philanthrocapital, Hungarian home borrowers' sense of futurity, the stylistics of household consumption in Chile, the appetites that drive financial apps, leverage's force-affects on space and time and the complicated hopefulness of the Rolling Jubilee. Together, these essays provide an empirics of indebtedness traversing the diverse social, affectual and material terrain of the everyday. This editors' introduction draws from their coordinates and atmospheres to enact a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> thinking across them: a way to gather up the residual, the unnoticed, the moment and the whole, in order to capture ‘something more’ of everyday debt and credit, not only as it passes but also in what it portends...|$|R
