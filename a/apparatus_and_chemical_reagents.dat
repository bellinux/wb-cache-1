30|$|A {{low-cost}} {{technology of}} treating furs with different contents of fatty substances was developed, which {{involves the use}} of solutions based on electrochemically activated water. The technology foresees substantial economy of water <b>and</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>reagents,</b> a two to threefold accceleration of soaking and tanning processes, and the formation of fur materials with necessary physical/chemical properties. The exclusion of such toxic reagents as formalin and sodium silicofluoride from treatment allows to regard this technology as ecologically safe compared to other technologies of fur manufacture.|$|R
40|$|As {{the desired}} feature sizes of {{semiconductor}} wafers continue to shrink, {{the ability to}} globally planarize the wafer surface becomes increasingly important. Chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) has the capability to achieve adequate local and global planarization necessitated by stringent future submicrometer very large scale inte-gration (VLSI) requirements. 1 - 3 CMP is now widely accepted for pla-narizing interlevel dielectrics 4, 5 and forming inlaid metal patterns. 6 - 8 Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of the CMP process. A rotating wafer is pressed facedown against a rotating polish pad.

30|$|Most fungal lipases act over a broad pH range, {{with the}} pH optima of 4.0 – 8.0 (Sharma et al. 2011; Singh and Mukhopadhyay 2012), and are {{mesophilic}} with thermolability at[*]>[*] 40  °C (Gutarra et al. 2009). The pH optimum of TlLipA was 9.5, which {{is higher than}} most fungal lipases characterized so far. Moreover, it showed great adaptability and stability under neutral to alkaline conditions (pH 7.0 – 10.0). On the other hand, TlLipA showed maximum activity at 50  °C and thermolability at[*]>[*] 40  °C. These enzymatic properties make TlLipA potential for application in the alkaline and low to moderate temperature fields, especially the washing industry (Jurado et al. 2007; Grbavčić et al. 2011). Some lipases are resistant to heavy metals, such as Ca 2 +, Fe 2 +, and Mg 2 + (Jurado et al. 2007; Gaur et al. 2008; Rao et al. 2009; Sethi et al. 2016). TlLipA showed similar tolerance to Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +, but showed sensitivity to heavy metals Ni 2 +, Mn 2 + and Zn 2 + <b>and</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>reagents</b> EDTA <b>and</b> β-mercaptoethanol. Thus the effects of metal ions <b>and</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>reagents</b> on TlLipA should be considered for future application.|$|R
