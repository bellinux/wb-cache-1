5|$|The Court's {{caseload}} {{continued to}} grow over time. In 1881 the general assembly approved {{the creation of a}} five-member panel of commissioners to assist the justices in administrative tasks. Even this was not enough to handle the load. In 1891 the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Court</b> of Indiana was created to handle cases of lower importance. At first the <b>appellate</b> <b>court</b> only took {{a small portion of the}} Supreme Court's caseload, but its responsibility gradually increased.|$|E
5|$|Its Supreme Court, {{headed by}} the Chief Justice, is {{paramount}} on constitutional issues. Other cases can be appealed to the two-judge <b>Appellate</b> <b>Court.</b> Parliament cannot overturn court decisions, but <b>Appellate</b> <b>Court</b> rulings can be appealed to the High Court of Australia. In practice this rarely happens. Lower courts consist of the District Court and the Family Court, {{both of which are}} headed by a Resident Magistrate, who also is the Registrar of the Supreme Court. There are two other quasi-courts: the Public Service Appeal Board and the Police Appeal Board, both of which are presided over by the Chief Justice.|$|E

40|$|This Article first {{examines}} the problem currently facing the <b>appellate</b> <b>courts</b> {{as to whether}} a party may initially raise ERISA preemption after trial or on appeal. The Article then reviews the various approaches to the problem by the <b>appellate</b> <b>courts.</b> Next, the Article {{examines the}} preemption principle enunciated by the Supreme Court under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) that some <b>appellate</b> <b>courts</b> regard as dispositive. The Article then explores {{the failure of the}} <b>appellate</b> <b>courts</b> to follow the ERISA mandate. Finally, the Article outlines the analysis <b>appellate</b> <b>courts</b> should conduct relating the legislative intent to the procedural effect of ERISA preemption in answering the question of whether a party can waive the preemption. This Article asserts that ERISA preemption is jurisdictional and, therefore, may be raised {{for the first time on}} appeal. This approach gives ERISA preemption the same procedural effect as NLRA preemption and preserves a uniform federal common law with respect to employee benefit plans, thereby encouraging the growth of private employee benefit plans...|$|R

5|$|Because Andrew Wilson {{was given}} a death sentence, his case was not {{reviewable}} on the same grounds by the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Court,</b> and it {{went directly to the}} Illinois Supreme Court. In April 1987, the Supreme Court overturned Andrew's conviction with a ruling that his confession had been coerced involuntarily from him while under duress. It ordered a new trial.|$|E
5|$|For example, between 1985 and 1991, over 75 public {{officials}} {{were convicted of}} corruption offenses in the Southern District of West Virginia alone.

5|$|In May 1999, Time Asia {{estimated}} Suharto's family fortune at US$15 {{billion in}} cash, shares, corporate assets, real estate, jewellery and fine art. Suharto sued the magazine seeking more than $US 27 billion in damages for libel over the article. On 10 September 2007, Indonesia's Supreme Court awarded Suharto damages against Time Asia magazine, ordering it {{to pay him}} one trillion rupiah ($128.59 million). The High Court reversed the judgement of an <b>appellate</b> <b>court</b> and Central Jakarta district court (made in 2000 and 2001).|$|E

At this time justices of the court also rode circuit, presiding over trials in designated counties in addition to serving as an <b>appellate</b> <b>court</b> judge for the Supreme Court. Deady {{was assigned to the}} southern counties of the territory, holding court in each county twice per year.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} 2 Live Crew responded to these efforts by suing the Broward County sheriff in federal {{district}} court. The sheriff had previously told local retailers that selling the album {{could result in}} a prosecution for obscenity violations. While they were granted an injunction because law enforcement actions were an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech, the court ruled that the album was in fact obscene. However, an <b>appellate</b> <b>court</b> reversed the obscenity ruling, because simply playing the tape was insufficient evidence of the constitutional requirement that it had no artistic value.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle finger}} has been {{involved}} in judicial hearings. An <b>appellate</b> <b>court</b> in Hartford, Connecticut ruled in 1976 that gesturing with the middle finger was offensive, but not obscene, after a police officer charged a 16-year-old with making an obscene gesture when the student gave the officer the middle finger. The case was appealed to the Connecticut Supreme Court, which upheld the decision. In March 2006, a federal lawsuit was filed regarding the free speech issue.|$|E

5|$|Honório Hermeto Carneiro Leão, Marquis of Paraná (11 January 1801– 3 September 1856) was a politician, diplomat, {{judge and}} monarchist of the Empire of Brazil. Paraná {{was born to}} a family of humble means in São Carlos do Jacuí, {{in what was then}} the {{captaincy}} of Minas Gerais. After attending the University of Coimbra in Portugal and having returned to Brazil, Paraná was appointed a judge in 1826 and later elevated to <b>appellate</b> <b>court</b> justice. In 1830, he was elected to represent Minas Gerais in the Chamber of Deputies; he was re-elected in 1834 and 1838, and held the post until 1841.|$|E
5|$|On July 17, 2012, Prague Municipal Court's {{panel of}} three judges headed by judge Luboš Vrba {{overturned}} the bail decision by doubling the bail amount to CZK 8 million (~ US$ 400,000). After this, the State Attorney challenged {{the conditions of}} release, trying to achieve that the bail is subject to Blythe staying in the country and/or Blythe having to report at a given police station regularly until the criminal proceedings are finished. On August 2, 2012, the <b>appellate</b> <b>court</b> rejected the State Attorney's second complaint and ordered Blythe's immediate release.

5|$|Tera McArthur asked {{two police}} {{officers}} to accompany her to a trailer home where she lived with her husband Charles, {{so that she could}} take her belongings out of the home. Just after she came out of the trailer, she told the police that Charles McArthur had drugs inside. The police knocked and asked Charles if they could search, which he refused. He then came out of the trailer; an officer prevented him from going back inside while the other policeman rushed to get a warrant. The Illinois <b>Appellate</b> <b>Court</b> held that this action violated the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures without a warrant. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to hear the case in 2000.|$|E
5|$|After filing suit, Monsanto moved for summary judgment. In response, Bowman {{argued that}} if Monsanto {{was allowed to}} {{continue}} its license past exhaustion, it {{would be able to}} dominate the market. Although the district court found Bowman's arguments compelling, it found that it was bound by previous <b>appellate</b> <b>court</b> decisions in Monsanto Co. v. Scruggs and Monsanto Co. v. McFarling to control, and in 2009, the district court ruled in favor of Monsanto. The court held that since the original farmers could not use the later generation seeds without a license, they could not make an unrestricted sale and therefore the patent rights were not exhausted. The court entered judgment for Monsanto in the amount of $84,456.30 and enjoined Bowman from making, using, selling or offering to sell any of the seeds from Monsanto's patent.|$|E
5|$|Although Roosevelt, {{most of his}} aides, Johnson, and the NRA staff {{felt the}} Act would survive a court test, the U.S. Department of Justice had on March 25, 1935, {{declined}} to appeal an <b>appellate</b> <b>court</b> ruling overturning the lumber industry code {{on the grounds that}} the case was not a good test of the NIRA's constitutionality. The Justice Department's action worried many in the administration. But on April 1, 1935 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of the NIRA in the Schechter case. Although Donald Richberg and others felt the government's case in Schechter was not a strong one, the Schechters were determined to appeal their conviction. So the government appealed first, and the Supreme Court heard oral argument on May 2 and 3.|$|E

5|$|English law is {{regarded}} as a common law system, with no major codification of the law, and legal precedents are binding as opposed to persuasive.The court system is headed by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom which is the highest court of appeal in the land for criminal and civil cases. The Senior Courts of England and Wales is the highest court of first instance as well as an <b>appellate</b> <b>court.</b> The three divisions are the Court of Appeal; the High Court of Justice and the Crown Court. Minor cases are heard by the Magistrates' Courts or the County Court. In 2007 the Wales and Cheshire Region (known as the Wales and Cheshire Circuit before 2005) came to an end when Cheshire was attached to the North-Western England Region. From that point Wales became a legal unit in its own right, although it remains part of the single jurisdiction of England and Wales.|$|E
5|$|In 1873 Reitz {{was asked}} to {{represent}} the district of Beaufort West in the Cape Parliament. The day he took his seat, 30 May, his father, who was the representative for Swellendam, announced his retirement from the Assembly. As so many of Reitz's activities up to that point, his parliamentary career was short-lived. Only two months later, President Johannes Brand of the Orange Free State offered Reitz the position of chairman of the newly formed <b>Appellate</b> <b>Court</b> of the Orange Free State, {{despite the fact that}} Reitz was not fully qualified (inter alia too young). Reitz refused the offer for this reason, but when another candidate also refused, Brand insisted on the nomination of Reitz, and convinced the Volksraad to appoint him.|$|E
5|$|In 1970 state {{constitutional}} amendments reorganized the Court. The constitution renamed the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Court</b> the Indiana Court of Appeals. With {{the formation of}} the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court could choose which cases it would hear and which cases it would leave to the lower courts. Constitutional amendments also lengthened judicial terms to ten years and changed the limits {{on the size of the}} Court to a minimum of five members and a maximum of nine. The method of selecting justices was changed from statewide election to appointment by the governor. The amendment also provided for a Judicial Nominating Commission to choose candidates. Justices also became subject to a retention election. In addition, the office of chief justice became permanent. Previously the title rotated among the justices. In 2004 the Indiana General Assembly created the Supreme Court Division of Administration, legalizing and expanding the role of the clerks of the Court.|$|E
