5|$|Astronomy {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} of the natural sciences.

Historically, astronomy has included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>making</b> of calendars, but professional astronomy is now often considered to be synonymous with astrophysics.|$|E

5|$|John Nott's The Cooks and Confectioners Dictionary (1723), {{still with}} rather few {{precedents}} to go by, chose an alphabetical treatment for its recipes, from Al to Zest. The book covered everything from soups and salads to meat and fish, {{as well as}} pastries of many kinds, confectionery, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>making</b> of beer, cider, and wine. Bills of fare are given for each month of the year.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the book}} Alfred Hitchcock <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Making</b> of Psycho, the censors in charge of {{enforcing}} the Production Code wrangled with Hitchcock because some of them insisted they could see one of Leigh's breasts. Hitchcock held onto the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Each of the censors reversed their positions: those who had previously seen the breast now did not, {{and those who had}} not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the buttocks of Leigh's stand-in. The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening with them on the set. Since they did not show up for the re-shoot, the opening stayed.|$|E
5|$|Eastwood {{directed}} {{and starred in}} White Hunter Black Heart (1990), an adaptation of Peter Viertel's roman à clef, about John Huston <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>making</b> of the classic film The African Queen. Shot on location in Zimbabwe {{in the summer of}} 1989, the film received some critical attention but with only a limited release earned just $8.4million. Later in 1990, Eastwood {{directed and}} co-starred with Charlie Sheen in The Rookie, a buddy cop action film. Critics found the film's plot and characterization unconvincing, but praised its action sequences. An ongoing lawsuit, in response to Eastwood allegedly ramming a woman's car, resulted in no Eastwood films being shown in cinemas in 1991. Eastwood won the suit and agreed to pay the complainant's legal fees if she did not appeal.|$|E

5|$|In Jainism, God has no {{role to play}} in an individual's destiny; one's {{personal}} destiny is {{not seen}} as a consequence of any system of reward or punishment, but rather {{as a result of its}} own personal karma. A text from a volume of the ancient Jain canon, Bhagvati sūtra 8.9.9, links specific states of existence to specific karmas. Violent deeds, killing of creatures having five sense organs, eating fish, and so on, lead to rebirth in hell. Deception, fraud and falsehood leads to rebirth in the animal and vegetable world. Kindness, compassion and humble character result in human birth; while austerities <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>making</b> and keeping of vows leads to rebirth in heaven.|$|E
5|$|Still {{photographs}} and scripts {{for the production}} survive, as do some amateur off-air reel-to-reel audio tape recordings of four of Dylan's songs. In 2005 the BBC launched {{a search for a}} video recording of the play, uncovering some audio recordings of the songs, but it seems that a full off-air audio copy does not exist. In April 2007, BBC Four broadcast a documentary about the making of the play in the Arena strand, featuring interviews with Saville, Jones, Martin Carthy, Peggy Seeger, Dylan collector Ian Woodward, and the first re-broadcast of the songs from the play. In November 2008, BBC Radio 2 broadcast a documentary, narrated by Bob Harris, about Dylan's visit to London <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>making</b> of the play.|$|E
