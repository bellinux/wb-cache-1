40|$|Vitamin B 12 (cobalamin) was {{identified}} nearly 80 {{years ago as}} the <b>anti-pernicious</b> <b>anaemia</b> <b>factor</b> in liver, and its importance in human health and disease has resulted in much work on its uptake, cellular transport and utilization. Plants do not contain cobalamin {{because they have no}} cobalamin-dependent enzymes. Deficiencies are therefore common in strict vegetarians, and in the elderly, who are susceptible to an autoimmune disorder that prevents its efficient uptake. In contrast, many algae are rich in vitamin B 12, with some species, such as Porphyra yezoensis (Nori), containing as much cobalamin as liver. Despite this, the role of the cofactor in algal metabolism remains unknown, as does the source of the vitamin for these organisms. A survey of 326 algal species revealed that 171 species require exogenous vitamin B 12 for growth, implying {{that more than half of}} the algal kingdom are cobalamin auxotrophs. Here we show that the role of vitamin B 12 in algal metabolism is primarily as a cofactor for vitamin B 12 -dependent methionine synthase, and that cobalamin auxotrophy has arisen numerous times throughout evolution, probably owing to the loss of the vitamin B 12 -independent form of the enzyme. The source of cobalamin seems to be bacteria, indicating an important and unsuspected symbiosis...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The new {{red blood}} cell (RBC) {{parameters}} from automated haematology analyzers, such as reticulocyte haemoglobin content and percentage of hypochromic red cells or equivalent, are useful in the laboratory assessment of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA). However, the clinical utility of these parameters are confounded by thalassaemia trait (TT) especially in geographical areas of high thalassaemia prevalence. We aimed to evaluate the new formula derived from some red cell parameters on the Beckman Coulter DxH 800 in distinguishing between IDA and TT in Hong Kong population. Methods: A total of 246 normal subjects, 102 patients with IDA and 115 subjects with TT were accrued for the study. Concurrent chronic disorder and ovelapped IDA and TT cases were excluded. The new red cell parameters studied were {{red blood cell}} size factor (RSF), low haemoglobin density (LHD%), microcytic <b>anaemia</b> <b>factor</b> (MAF), standard deviation of conductivity of the non-reticulocyte population (SD-C-NRET) and unghosted cell (UGC). Comparison between groups was performed by student t-test and the diagnostic performance of the parameters was determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: Both LHD% and RSF were significantly higher in IDA than TT, whereas MAF was significantly lower. Although the biological basis was uncertain, SD-C-NRET was significantly lower in IDA than TT and showed the best diagnostic performance as a single parameter. A formula ((RBC+HB) *(HCT+SD-C-NRET)) /(RDW-SD) was devised to distinguish between IDA and TT. With a cutoff value of 23, the area under curve (AUC) was 0. 995 (95 % CI of 0. 99 – 1. 00), the sensitivity was 97 % and the specificity was 99. 1 %. This formula was superior to other discriminant functions in the literature. The UGC number was not significantly different between alpha- and beta-TT. Conclusions: The new RBC parameters on Beckman Coulter DxH 800 provided useful information in distinguishing between IDA and TT, which is important for clinical decision making and streamlining further laboratory testing. This index {{can be used to}} screen patients who are likely to be IDA or TT for further hematological studies to confirm diagnosis. published_or_final_versionPathologyMasterMaster of Medical Science...|$|R
40|$|Malaria {{and other}} haemosporin parasites must undergo {{a round of}} sexual {{reproduction}} in their insect vector {{in order to produce}} stages that can be transmitted to vertebrate hosts. Consequently, it is crucial that parasites produce the sex ratio (proportion of male sexual stages) that will maximize the number of fertilizations and thus, transmission to new vertebrate hosts. There is some evidence to show that, consistent with evolutionary theory, the sex ratios of malaria parasites are negatively correlated to their inbreeding rate. However, recent theory has shown that when fertilization success is compromised, parasites should respond by increasing their investment in sexual stages or by producing a less female biased sex ratio than predicted by their inbreeding rate alone. Here, we show that two species of rodent malaria, Plasmodium chabaudi and Plasmodium vinckei petteri, adopt different strategies in response to host <b>anaemia,</b> a <b>factor</b> thought to compromise transmission success: P. chabaudi increases investment in sexual stages, whereas P. vinckei produces a less female biased sex ratio.

40|$|The authors review recent {{progresses}} made in {{the understanding}} of the disturbed gastrin homeostasis in Helicobacter pylori infection and in pernicious anaemia. Regulation of gastrin release is a complex mechanism involving inhibition by a low gastric pH and several peptides including somatostatin, and stimulation by different factors, mainly alimentary peptides and amino-acids. The hypergastrinaemia observed in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection occurs despite a normal intraluminal pH. This may be through alcalinisation of the gastric mucus layer due to the production of ammonia by the bacterial urease or through local release of inflammatory mediators. In pernicious <b>anaemia</b> a <b>factor</b> present in the anacid gastric juice could explain the important hypergastrinaemia observed. The gastrin releasing activity of the gastric juice itself was demonstrated by a decrease of the patients' plasma gastrin concentration during a neutral gastric lavage and by a rise of the gastrin levels in rats whose stomachs were perfused with gastric juice from pernicious anaemia patients. A better understanding of the relation between gastric pH and gastrin release is important not only for these pathological states but also for treatments which suppress acid secretion...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Severe anaemia (SA), {{intravascular}} haemolysis (IVH) {{and respiratory}} distress (RD) are severe forms of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, with RD {{reported to be}} of prognostic importance in African children with malarial <b>anaemia.</b> Complement <b>factors</b> have been implicated in the mechanism leading to excess anaemia in acute P. falciparum infection. Methods The direct Coombs test (DCT) and flow cytometry were used to investigate the mean levels of RBC-bound complement fragments (C 3 d and C 3 bαβ) and the regulatory proteins [complement receptor 1 (CD 35) and decay accelerating factor (CD 55) ] in children with discrete clinical forms of P. falciparum malaria. The relationship between the findings and clinical parameters including coma, haemoglobin (Hb) levels and RD were investigated. Results Of the 484 samples tested, 131 (27 %) were positive in DCT, out of which 115 / 131 (87. 8 %) were positive for C 3 d alone while 16 / 131 (12. 2 %) were positive for either IgG alone or both. 67. 4 % of the study population were below 5 {{years of age and}} DCT positivity was more common in this age group relative to children who were 5 years or older (Odds ratio, OR = 3. 8; 95 %CI, 2. 2 – 6. 7, p Conclusion These results suggest that complement activation contributed to anaemia in acute childhood P. falciparum malaria, possibly through induction of erythrophagocytosis and haemolysis.

40|$|The {{mortality}} rate in diabetics with {{chronic kidney disease}} (CKD) is seven times higher than end-stage renal disease mainly because of cardiac causes. Anaemia may have a relevant role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular (CV) disease in CKD. Anaemia occurs at an earlier stage of CKD in diabetic individuals than in those with other causes of CKD. Observational findings support the unfavourable influence of anaemia on mortality in CKD patients, and the combination of anaemia and CKD in diabetics identifies a group with a particularly high mortality risk. While the effect of erythropoietin on these patients' {{quality of life is}} known, its impact on mortality and CV risk is uncertain. The recent Anaemia Correction in Diabetes (ACORD) trial in diabetic CKD patients, which targeted haemoglobin levels of 13 - 15 mg/dl, disclosed no statistically significant favourable or adverse effects on mortality or morbidity over the 2 -year follow-up, while other studies endeavouring to nearly normalize haemoglobin have reportedly proved risky.

40|$|In malaria-endemic {{countries}} of Africa, anaemia {{is very common}} in pregnant women and in children under five. Although <b>anaemia</b> is multifactorial—causative <b>factors</b> include iron deficiency and other nutritional deficiencies, helminth infection, and HIV—malaria is clearly an extremely important factor. Over half of malaria-related deaths are attributed to severe malaria anaemia (which is defined as malaria parasitaemia and a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration less than 50 g/l) [1]. Several antimalarial interventions {{have been shown to}} prevent anaemia, including insecticidetreated nets, residual spraying, malaria chemoprophylaxis, and, more recently, intermittent presumptive treatment of infants (i. e., antimalarials coadministered with childhood immunization). Insecticide-treated nets have been shown to decrease all-cause mortality [2]. The pathogenesis of malaria anaemia remains incompletely understood. Dyserythropoiesis (disordered red cell development, which is, at least in part, due to inflammatory cytokines acting on erythroid precursors), intravascular haemolysis of infected red cells, and destruction of both parasitized and uninfected erythrocytes by splenic macrophages are all important [3, 4]. Interestingly, {{it has been estimated that}} ten or more uninfected erythrocytes may be lost for each infected one [5], presumably because malaria infection alters uninfected erythrocytes. The probable causes of red cell loss include oxidation of band 3 (the anion transporter of the erythrocyte membrane) or membrane lipids, and deposition of IgG, complement, or immune complexes on the erythrocyte surface.

40|$|Background The {{determination}} of dosing regimens {{for the treatment}} of malaria is largely empirical and thus {{a better understanding of the}} pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of antimalarial agents is required to assess the adequacy of current treatment regimens and identify sources of suboptimal dosing that could select for drug-resistant parasites. Mefloquine is a widely used antimalarial, commonly given in combination with artesunate. Patients and methods Mefloquine pharmacokinetics was assessed in 24 healthy adults and 43 patients with Plasmodium falciparum malaria administered mefloquine in combination with artesunate. Population pharmacokinetic modelling was conducted using NONMEM. Results A two-compartment model with a single transit compartment and first-order elimination from the central compartment most adequately described mefloquine concentration-time data. The model incorporated population parameter variability for clearance (CL/F), central volume of distribution (VC/F) and absorption rate constant (KA) and identified, in addition to body weight, malaria infection as a covariate for VC/F (but not CL/F). Monte Carlo simulations predict that falciparum malaria infection is associated with a shorter elimination half-life (407 versus 566 h) and T>MIC (766 versus 893 h). Conclusions This is the first known population pharmacokinetic study to show falciparum malaria to influence mefloquine disposition. Protein binding, <b>anaemia</b> and other <b>factors</b> may contribute to differences between healthy individuals and patients.

Results: Two hundred and twenty-seven pregnant women whose ages ranged from 16 to 40 years {{with a mean age}} of 26. 8 ± 4. 3 years were recruited for the study. The haemoglobin concentration ranged from 6 g/dL – 15 g/dL with a mean of 10. 10 ± 1. 27 g/dL. A total of 142 (62. 6 %) participants were anaemic. Anaemia was observed to be least prevalent in women within the extremes of reproductive age (≤ 20 years and 36 – 40 years). There was no statistically significant association between age, educational level and marital status (p > 0. 05). The association of anaemia with social class was statistically significant (p = 0. 000).

Conclusion: The prevalence of anaemia amongst the pregnant participants in the primary health centre was high. Out of all the socio-demographic characteristics, only socio-economic status was significantly associated with anaemia. It is recommended that the socio-economic status of women should be enhanced in line with the Millennium Development Goals to prevent anaemia and to enhance pregnancy outcomes. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{determination}} of dosing regimens {{for the treatment}} of malaria is largely empirical and thus {{a better understanding of the}} pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of antimalarial agents is required to assess the adequacy of current treatment regimens and identify sources of suboptimal dosing that could select for drug-resistant parasites. Mefloquine is a widely used antimalarial, commonly given in combination with artesunate. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Mefloquine pharmacokinetics was assessed in 24 healthy adults and 43 patients with Plasmodium falciparum malaria administered mefloquine in combination with artesunate. Population pharmacokinetic modelling was conducted using NONMEM. RESULTS: A two-compartment model with a single transit compartment and first-order elimination from the central compartment most adequately described mefloquine concentration-time data. The model incorporated population parameter variability for clearance (CL/F), central volume of distribution (VC/F) and absorption rate constant (KA) and identified, in addition to body weight, malaria infection as a covariate for VC/F (but not CL/F). Monte Carlo simulations predict that falciparum malaria infection is associated with a shorter elimination half-life (407 versus 566 h) and T>MIC (766 versus 893 h). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first known population pharmacokinetic study to show falciparum malaria to influence mefloquine disposition. Protein binding, <b>anaemia</b> and other <b>factors</b> may contribute to differences between healthy individuals and patients. As VC/F is related to the earlier portion of the concentration-time profiles, which occurs during acute malaria, and CL/F is more related to the terminal phase during convalescence after treatment, this may explain why malaria was found to be a covariate for VC/F but not CL/F.

40|$|Objectives: The {{present study}} was carried {{to find out the}} {{frequency}} of haemolytic anaemia, to know the different etiological factors and their percentage in the region of marathwada, Maharashtra. Background: Knowledge of frequency and different etiological factors is essential for the information of magnitude and treatment of the patients. The {{present study was}} done in the department of pathology, Gov. Medical College, Aurangabad, district of Maharashtra. The patients from marathwada region of the Maharashtra were included in this study. The concerned study of “Haemoglobinopathies in Childhood” was conducted by Anil J in 1984 in the same institute. Methodology: Total 76 clinically suspected cases were investigated. For the study routine investigations like Hb estimation, peripheral blood smear examination, reticulocyte count and special investigations like sickling test, Hb solubility test, estimation of faetal haemoglobin and Hb electrophoresis were carried out. Results: Total 76 cases were studied. Out of it 51 cases were male (67. 10 %) and 25 (32. 89 %) cases were female. The patients are in the age group, 5 months to 45 years. Out of 76 cases 51 cases were diagnosed as haemolytic anaemia. In these 51 cases of haemolytic anaemia, 42 cases (82. 35 %) of haemoglobinopathies, it cases (15. 68 %) of malaria and one case (1. 96 %) of auto immune haemolytic anaemia were found to have as causative factor. Conclusion: It showed that the frequency of haemolytic anaemia in studied 76 cases was 67. 10 %. In diagnosed 51 cases of haemolytic <b>anaemia,</b> the causative <b>factor</b> as haemoglobinopathy was 82. 35 % and other than haemoglobinopathy was 17. 65 %. It also showed that majority of the cases in this region were belonging to beta thalassaemia major, which is more common in western zone of India followed by sickle cell anaemia...|$|R
40|$|Background: Nutritional anaemia, one of {{the major}} public health {{problems}} in India is associated with lower productivity, higher sickness rate and absenteeism having inter-generational effect. Morbidity during adolescent has implication on future safe motherhood, optimum growth and development of foetus and children. Aims and Objective: To assess, prevalence and determinants of anaemia and effect of different interventions amongst tea tribe adolescent girls. Materials & Methods : A community based intervention study was conducted covering 16 tea estates of Dibrugarh District, Assam. Variables includes socio-demographic, environmental, anthropometry, history of present and past illness, clinical examination and laboratory investigation including haemoglobin, serum ferritin, haemoglobin typing and routine stool examination. Interventions given were weekly IFA supplementation, dietary diversification, health promotion by monthly NHED, cooking demonstration, cooking competition and kitchen garden promotion and counselling to improve IFA compliance and remove barriers was done. SPSS and EpiInfo software, used to calculate of rates, ratios, chi-square test, Fisher Exact test and multiple logistic regression analysis. Results: Enrolments were 802, with mean age, 14. 8 years. Anaemia prevalence was 96. 3 % with median serum ferritin, 22. 9 ng/ml. Prevalence of Sickle cell anaemia was, 12 % and helminthiasis 84. 20 %.   History of passage of worms (9. 1 %), night blindness (5. 6 %), weakness (62. 1 %), loss of appetite (37. 5 %), gum bleeding (23. 6 %), loose motion (13 %), loss of weight (9. 9 %), menstrual problem (19. 3 %) was common. Following intervention mean haemoglobin difference was 1. 48 gm/dl with 13. 5 % difference in prevalence. Associated morbidities showed significant reduction following active intervention. Conclusions: High anaemia prevalence requires urgent attention to avoid preventable morbidities.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{is limited}} {{longitudinal}} data from high-income {{countries on the}} sequelae of anaemia during pregnancy. The {{aim of this study}} is to examine whether anaemia of pregnancy is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes and with children's developmental vulnerability. METHODS: We conducted a population-based study to link routinely collected government administrative data that involved all live births in the state of South Australia 1999 - 2005 (n[*]=[*] 124 [*] 061) and a subset for whom developmental data were collected during a national census of children attending their first year of school in 2009 (n[*]=[*] 13 [*] 654). Perinatal outcomes were recorded by midwives using a validated, standardised form. Development was recorded by schoolteachers using the Australian Early Development Index (AEDI). Children in the lowest 10 % of AEDI scores are indicative of developmental vulnerability. RESULTS: There were 8764 / 124 [*] 061 (7. 1 %) cases of anaemia. After adjustment for a range of potentially confounding <b>factors,</b> <b>anaemia</b> of pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of fetal distress [incident rate ratio (IRR) 1. 20 [95 % CI 1. 13, 1. 27]] and preterm birth < 37 weeks gestation (IRR 1. 23 [1. 15, 1. 31]), slightly higher birthweight [14 [*]g (2, 26) ] and newborns were less likely to require resuscitation (IRR 0. 94 [0. 91, 0. 097]). Anaemia of pregnancy was not associated with children's developmental vulnerability after adjustment for maternal, obstetric and sociodemographic covariables, either in complete case analyses (n[*]=[*] 11 [*] 949) or after imputation for missing data (n[*]=[*] 13 [*] 654). CONCLUSIONS: Anaemia of pregnancy is associated with perinatal complications but not with children's developmental vulnerability at school entry. Lisa G.

40|$|Little {{evidence}} {{about the effects of}} antenatal iron supplementation on infant anaemia is available. The aim was to compare effects on six-month-old infants' Haemoglobin (Hb) concentration and anaemia of daily iron-folic acid (IFA), twice-weekly IFA with or without other micronutrients (MMN) and usual antenatal care in rural Vietnam. Secondary data analysis from: a prospective population-based observational study (OS) which examined effects of antenatal psychosocial <b>factors,</b> <b>anaemia</b> and iron deficiency on infant development and health; and a three-arm cluster randomised trial (CRT) of different antenatal iron supplementation regimens. In the OS 497 women (< 20 weeks gestation) from 50 randomly-selected communes participated, and in the CRT 1, 258 pregnant women (< 16 weeks gestation) in 104 communes were allocated randomly to trial arms. The main outcome was six-month-old infant Hb concentration. Baseline data included women's socio-demographic characteristics, reproductive health, Hb and serum ferritin. Mean differences in infant Hb and odds ratios of infant anaemia between CRT arms and OS were calculated by multivariable regression models, controlling for baseline differences and clustering, using robust standard errors. Infant anaemia prevalence was 68. 6 % in the OS, 47. 2 % daily IFA, 53. 5 % weekly IFA, and 50. 3 % MMN conditions. After adjustment, mean infant haemoglobin levels in daily IFA (mean difference = 0. 95 g/dL; 95 %CI 0. 7 - 11. 18); weekly IFA (0. 91; 95 %CI 0. 69 - 1. 12) and MMN (1. 04; 95 %CI 0. 8 - 1. 27) were higher than in the OS.

40|$|Almost 40 years ago, it was {{reported}} that cattle-feed which had been extracted with hot trichloroethylene and then fed to calves produced renal injury and a fatal aplastic <b>anaemia.</b> The toxic <b>factor</b> was subsequently identified as S-(1, 2 -dichlorovinyl) -L-cysteine (DCVC). These original findings have been confirmed, a single intravenous dose of DCVC at 4 mg/kg, or 0. 4 mg/kg intravenously per day administered for 10 days to calves produced aplastic anaemia, and renal injury after a single dose of 4 mg/kg. The toxicity to calves of a number of other haloalkene cysteine conjugates has been examined to ascertain whether, like DCVC, they produce bone marrow and renal injury. Intravenous administration of the N-acetyl cysteine conjugate of DCVC produced renal but not bone marrow injury at a molar equivalent dose to DCVC, indicating that the calf can deacetylate the mercapturic acid and further that sufficient chemical had reached the kidney to be a substrate for the enzyme cysteine conjugate β-lyase. However, intravenous administration of the α-methyl analogue of DCVC, which cannot undergo metabolism via the enzyme cysteine conjugate β-lyase, was without toxicity at doses about five-fold higher than DCVC. These latter findings provide strong evidence that metabolism of DCVC via the enzyme β-lyase is necessary for bone marrow and renal injury to occur. The cysteine conjugates of perchloroethylene and hexachloro- 1, 3 -butadiene(HCBD) when given intravenously to calves at molar equivalent doses to DCVC, or above, did not produce either bone marrow or renal injury. In contrast, intravenous administration of the cysteine conjugate of tetrafluoroethylene (TFEC) produced severe renal tubular injury in calves without affecting the bone marrow. In vitro studies with these haloalkene cysteine conjugates showed, like DCVC, that they were good substrates for calf renal cysteine conjugate β-lyase and toxic to renal cells as judged by their ability to reduce organic anion and cation transport by slices of calf renal cortex and inhibit the renal enzyme glutathione reductase. Calves were also dosed either orally or intravenously with HCBD to assess its toxicity. HCBD at higher molar equivalent doses than DCVC produced mid-zonal necrosis in the liver, renal tubular- necrosis but no bone marrow injury in calves. The key findings emerging from these studies are (I) that none of the other cysteine conjugates, at molar equivalent doses to DCVC and above, produce bone marrow injury in calves, (2) TFEC produced only renal injury, suggesting that sufficient of the other conjugates had not reached the kidney for metabolism by β-lyase to produce cytotoxicity and (3) that HCBD itself is more toxic than its cysteine or mercapturic acid conjugate, suggesting that pharmacokinetics and disposition are important factors in determining the toxicity of these conjugates to calves. Further studies are needed to understand the basis for the selective toxicity of DCVC to the bone marrow of calves...|$|R
40|$|Anaemia in {{pregnancy}} {{is one of}} the main maternal health problems globally, affecting over 50 % of pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa. Although not always shown to have a causal link, severe anaemia contributes to maternal morbidity and mortality and to poor pregnancy outcomes and infant survival. The work encompassed in this thesis describes fertility and health {{in pregnancy}} with a specific emphasis on anaemia. In addition, the applicability of ITNs for the prevention of malaria and anaemia in pregnancy is examined in more detail. In Part II of the thesis, achieved fertility and the family building preferences of women are described. A high fertility setting is described in which there is also a high incidence of late pregnancy loss, which increases the exposure of women to poor maternal health outcomes. There were indications of an increasing desire for fertility regulation methods, especially amongst teenagers. This was evidenced principally by high levels of unmet need amongst teenagers for family planning methods, and through focus group discussions which highlighted induced abortion as a pressing concern for the health of young women. In Part III of the thesis the magnitude of anaemia as a health problem in pregnancy is discussed. In Kilombero over three-quarters of pregnant women were anaemic, 11 % severely so, which defines the area as high risk. Multiple risk <b>factors</b> for <b>anaemia</b> were present and there was a sharp seasonal peak. In this study malaria and iron deficiency were both important contributors. Unmarried women, both primigravidae and multigravidae, were at increased risk of being severely anaemic suggesting that socio-economic vulnerability also plays an important role. The relevance of pregnancy anaemia as a public health issue was underlined by our findings that, independent of other <b>factors,</b> <b>anaemia</b> in pregnancy was associated with a three-fold increase in infant mortality risk. In Part IV the impact of socially-marketed insecticide treated nets on pregnancy and child morbidity was reported. Social marketing proved to be a highly successful tool for delivering ITNs with a rapid increase in uptake of the product. At the time of these impact surveys 61 % of under two year olds and 53 % of pregnant women were ITN users. This was the first evaluation of the impact of ITNs on morbidity under programme conditions. ITN use was associated with a reduction of 38 % of all cases of severe anaemia in pregnancy and 63 % of all cases in children under two years of age. It is recommended that ITNs be promoted at every level for use by pregnant women and children. Women in the Kilombero Valley have a high life-time risk of dying due to pregnancy related causes, typical of the sub-Saharan Region as a whole. They are exposed to the three biggest contributors to ill health: poverty, malnutrition and infectious disease, especially malaria. Approaches for tackling these problems using complimentary strategies are discussed. However, due to the multi-level benefits of ITN use in pregnancy – through protection of the pregnant woman, her growing foetus, and subsequently impacting on infant health - insecticide-treated bednets, together with improved campaigns for highlighting the needs of pregnant women, are indicated as the principal way forward to better health...|$|R
