50|$|The <b>alfonsino</b> (<b>Beryx</b> decadactylus), {{also known}} as the alfonsin, longfinned beryx, red bream, or imperador, is a species of {{deepwater}} berycid fish of the order Beryciformes. It can be found in temperate and subtropical ocean waters nearly worldwide, though it is uncommon. It is typically associated with deep-sea corals, and schools are known to form over seamounts. Adults are demersal and search for prey along the ocean floor, primarily fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans. Like other members of its family, it is remarkably long-lived, with individuals reaching ages of up to 69 years, and possibly longer. It can reach sizes of up to 100.0 cm in length and 2.5 kg in weight and is targeted by commercial fisheries. Its low reproductive rate and the time it takes for juveniles to mature make it vulnerable to expanding deep-sea fisheries, but it is listed as Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to its extensive range.|$|R

40|$|A benthic {{community}} constituted by {{an assemblage of}} at least four species of deep-sea corals collected in only one trawl carried-out on {{the summit of the}} O'Higgins I seamount, central Chile. The corals were collected in only one trawl carried-out during a Chilean-Japanese cruise onboard the R/V" Koyo Maru" in December 29, 2004. Presence of oxygenated and cold Antarctic Intermediate Water (> 400 m depth) on the plateau was recorded under of the Equatorial Subsurface Water associated to the oxygen-minimum zone (OMZ, < 1 mL O 2 L- 1). The biogeographic origin of the fauna evidenced a mix of Subantarctic and central Chile continental margin species. The assemblage is represented by two species of anthipatarians (Leiopathes sp. and Chrysopathes sp.), one unidentified species of Paragorgiidae and one species of Isididae (Acanella chilensis).

Ninety-two hauls were carried out over one peak located in Div. 6 G, with big catches of <b>alfonsino</b> (<b>Beryx</b> splendens), but only six hauls showing coral records (Enallopsamia rostrata, Solenosmilia variabilis, Madrepora oculata, Acanella eburnea and Placogorgia terceira) and in less quantities in comparison with Divs. 6 EF.

40|$|<b>Alfonsino</b> (<b>Beryx</b> splendens) is {{a species}} {{associated}} with seamounts, with an important fishery in Juan Fernandez archipelago, Chile (33 ° 40 'S, 79 ° 00 'W). Since 2004, this resource has been managed by catch quotas estimated from stock assessment models. The alfonsino model involves {{high levels of}} uncertainty for several reasons including {{a lack of knowledge}} of aspects of the population dynamics and poorly informative time-series that feed the proposed evaluation models. This work evaluated three hypotheses regarding population dynamics and their influence on the main state variables (biomass, recruitment) of the model using age-structured and dynamic biomass models. The hypotheses corresponded to de-recruitment of older individuals, non-linearity between standardized catch per unit effort, and population abundance as well as variations of the relative importance of length structures. According to the results, the depletion of the spawning biomass between 1998 and 2008 varied between 9 and 56 %, depending on the combination of hypotheses used in the model. This indicates that state variables in alfonsino are not robust to the available information; rather, they depend strongly on the hypothesis of population dynamics. The discussion is focused on interpreting the causes of the changes in the state variables in light of a conceptual model for population dynamics in alfonsino and which pieces of information would be necessary to reduce the associated uncertainty...|$|R

40|$|Research Paper and PowerPoint PresentationThis paper aims {{to analyse}} and {{elucidate}} key {{conditions for the}} sustainability of community-based fisheries management (CBFM) on unrestricted fisheries in Japan. It re-examines more than 50 years’ worth of empirical evidence regarding the outcomes of the socio-economic rationality of the self-imposed management of common property, with particular reference to splendid <b>alfonsino</b> (<b>Beryx</b> splendens) fishing grounds off Katsuura, Chiba Prefecture, and the Small-Type Coastal Fishing Vessel Fishery Cooperative (STCC) there. It shows that the exclusive use of fishing grounds and other factors, including communal solidarity and a social milieu advocating fishermen’s protection of fishing grounds observed roughly 20 years ago, have for more than 50 years continuously existed as conditions necessary to establishing sustainable CBFM in unrestricted alfonsino fisheries using waters off Katsuura. At present, however, it should be recognised that the resource management of alfonsino as a migratory species would be required with different types of fishery operations in fishing grounds other than STCC’s operation near Katsuura. To resolve this issue, a co-management system involving a resource management plan and fisheries risk management plan under the fraternal insurance of the fishery was recently introduced {{in collaboration with the}} Japanese government, Chiba’s prefectural government, and the STCC. As a type of adaptive fisheries management system in Japan, this co-management system would {{play an important role in}} securing key sustainable conditions for CBFM in unrestricted, self-managing fisheries in alfonsino fishing grounds off Katsuura, Japan...|$|R
40|$|Identification of two sibling {{species of}} <b>alfonsino,</b> <b>Beryx</b> mollis Abe 1959 and B. splendens Lowe 1834, using simple {{morphological}} and meristic measurements - Two sibling species, Beryx mollis and B. splendens, are potentially the main fish species of commercial interest for a bottom-line fishery {{in the deep}} waters of New Caledonia's EEZ. Two datasets, morphological and meristic (one from Japan, the other one from New Caledonia) were obtained from specimen samples of the two species, which were species-identified by either the number of pyloric caeca (which allows total discrimination of the two species), or DNA markers, or a posteriori by the outcome of principal component analysis (PCA). Four morphological variables were measured (body height, head length, snout length, orbit diameter) and transformed to take standard length into account. None of these morphological variables, either single or combined to another, allowed sufficient discrimination between the two species. PCA on the four morphological variables led to a slightly better result, but still insufficient. Six meristic variables were utilized (numbers of soft rays in the dorsal, pectoral, pelvic, and anal fins, number of branchiospines on {{the lower half of}} the first branchial arch, number of scales on the lateral line). All these variables except the number of scales on the lateral line, proved useful to statistically distinguish the two species. However, none was diagnostic when taken separately from the other variables and the combination of two variables was only slightly better for this purpose. Canonical discriminant analysis helped determine which meristic characters could be used in priority to identify individuals: these were the numbers of soft rays on the dorsal, pectoral, and pelvic fins, and the number of branchiospines. In practice, if the fish is disembowelled or filetted, it takes only counting the number of pyloric caeca for identification to species. If the fish is preserved whole before being marketed, then we recommend to count the numbers of soft rays on the dorsal, pectoral, and pelvic fins for a reasonably reliable identificatio...|$|R
