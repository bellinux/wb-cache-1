5|$|Whilst {{the last}} members were signing it Doctor. Franklin looking towards the Presidents Chair, {{at the back}} of which <b>a</b> <b>rising</b> sun {{happened}} to be painted, observed to a few members near him, that Painters had found it difficult to distinguish in their art <b>a</b> <b>rising</b> from a setting sun.

60|$|The doctrine, indeed, that <b>a</b> <b>rise</b> {{of wages}} causes <b>an</b> {{equivalent}} <b>rise</b> of prices, is, as we formerly observed, self-contradictory: for, {{if it did}} so, {{it would not be}} <b>a</b> <b>rise</b> of wages; the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before, let his money wages rise ever so much; <b>a</b> <b>rise</b> of real wages would be an impossibility. This being equally contrary to reason and to fact, it is evident that <b>a</b> <b>rise</b> of money wages does not raise prices; that high wages are not a cause of high prices. <b>A</b> <b>rise</b> of general wages falls on profits. There is no possible alternative.|$|R
