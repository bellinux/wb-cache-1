50|$|A trap primer (or {{trap seal}} primer) is a <b>plumbing</b> <b>device</b> or valve that adds water to traps.

The trap primer mitigates this problem by injecting water, either directly or indirectly, into the trap to maintain the water seal indefinitely.|$|R

50|$|A {{grease trap}} (also known as grease interceptor, grease {{recovery}} device and grease converter) is a <b>plumbing</b> <b>device</b> (a type of trap) designed to intercept most greases and solids before they enter a wastewater disposal system. Common wastewater contains {{small amounts of}} oils which enter into septic tanks and treatment facilities to form a floating scum layer. This scum layer is very slowly digested and broken down by microorganisms in the anaerobic digestion process. Large amounts of oil from food preparation in restaurants can overwhelm a septic tank or treatment facility, causing release of untreated sewage into the environment. High-viscosity fats and cooking grease such as lard solidify when cooled, and can combine with other disposed solids to block drain pipes.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Fat, oil {{and grease}} are the three {{elements}} usually found in the municipal sewage systems as the results of improper disposal from the sink. These elements come from domestic and commercial kitchens. The absent or inefficient of a <b>plumbing</b> <b>device</b> known as grease trap has caused the trapped of fat, {{oil and grease}} in the sewage systems. There {{are two types of}} grease trap, namely Passive Grease Trap and Active Grease Trap. These grease types are collected and they can be recycled and used to produce an energy source, for example biodiesel. In Malaysia, the usages of passive grease traps are exercised. There are two parameters that govern the construction of the grease trap, namely retention time and flow rate. The ratio of sizing including the empirical formulations regarding the flow rate and the retention time will be discussed thoroughly in this paper. Furthermore, the {{understanding of the nature of}} the fat, oil and grease and the construction guideline for grease trap will be covered in this paper...|$|R
40|$|For roughly forty years, from 1870 to 1910, Americans {{recognized}} and feared gases emanating from sewers, believing {{that they were}} responsible for causing an array of diseases. Fears of sewer gas arose from deeper anxieties toward contact with decomposing organic matter and the vapors emitted from such refuse. These anxieties were exacerbated by the construction of sewers across the country during the mid-to-late-nineteenth century, which concentrated waste emanations and connected homes to one another. The result was the birth of sewer gas and the attribution of sickness and death to it, {{as well as the}} development of a host of <b>plumbing</b> <b>devices</b> and, especially, bathroom fixtures, to combat sewer gas. The rise of the germ theory, laboratory science, and belief in disease specificity, however, transformed the threat of sewer gas, eventually replacing it (and the larger fear of miasmas) with the threat of germs. The germ theory framework, by 1910, proved more suitable than the sewer gas framework in explaining disease causation; it is this suitability that often shapes the relationship between science and society...|$|R

40|$|Some {{may think}} there’s a conflictbetween NSF International ’sStandard 61 —which deal with lead, other heavy metals and organ-ics—and the Drinking Water Treat-ment Unit (DWTU) program stan-dards, but this isn’t so. As {{explained}} in ANSI/NSF Standard 61 Section 9, in-line devices, point-of-use and point-of-entry (POU/POE) drinking water treatment units are exempt. Therefore, any faucet that’s used {{exclusively for the}} dispensing of filtered water from a point-of-use filtration device is exempt from Standard 61. That being said, Section 9 includes basically all me-chanical <b>plumbing</b> <b>devices,</b> compo-nents and materials typically installed within the last liter of the distribution system and are intended by the manu-facturer to dispense water for human ingestion. There are products, however, crossing into both standards. An ex-ample would be refrigerator water dis-pensers and icemakers. With these, the filter and filter housing are certified to DWTU standards, but the internal waterway and dispensing units are Section 9 certified, {{whether or not they}} include a filter. A second example is the new filter-faucet products; again, the filter unit would obtain DWTU certification where the faucet would obtain Section 9 certification.

40|$|From the Proceedings of the 1984 Meetings of the Arizona Section - American Water Resources Assn. and the Hydrology Section - Arizona-Nevada Academy of Science - April 7, 1984, Flagstaff, ArizonaUnderstanding {{residential}} water uses {{is important}} for forecasting water demand. Data from survey questionnaires received from over 2000 Tucson Water customers are used to analyze individual household water use patterns. Earlier findings by the authors based on aggregate census data are verified and expanded. Initial findings indicate that both indoor and peak outdoor water demand, modeled separately, are determined by three factors. The factors are categorized as 1) a demographic component, describing {{the number of people}} in the household and their ages, 2) a wealth component, relating water consumption to income, home value and certain appliance ownership, and 3) a residency component, which includes the age of the home, length of time the household has lived in the home, and length of time the household has lived in the Tucson area. Regression analysis indicates that households newer to Tucson consume less water than otherwise similar households. The analysis also shows that an average swimming pool consumes substantially more water than a lawn of equal area. Two actions resulting in reduced indoor water consumption are installing low-flow <b>plumbing</b> <b>devices</b> and directly paying the water bill. Water conservation program strategies based upon these findings are summarized...|$|R

40|$|Microbial {{analysis}} {{has long been}} used {{as an indicator of}} water quality. Since the passing of the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1974, microbial standards have been strictly set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to ensure that the public health is protected from bacterial pathogens. The bacteriological quality of water generally deteriorates as it travels from water treatment facilities through the main distribution system and into private plumbing and distribution systems. For example, Heterotrophic Plate Count (HPC) values typically increase once the water has entered <b>plumbing</b> <b>devices</b> such as beverage vending machines. Upon reaching a private facility, the opportunity for bacterial growth and human contamination is present. In this study used the EPA water quality standards were used as a reference to analyze ice and soda samples collected from local food establishments for the presence of heterotrophic and coliform bacteria. The samples were evaluated with respect to the U. S. drinking water standards as indicators {{of the quality of the}} ice and soda. The study provided important information regarding the quality of the ice and soda dispensed in Las Vegas food establishments. Of the samples analyzed in this study, 33. 3 % of ice samples and 55. 6 % of soda samples exceeded the EPA limits set for heterotrophic bacteria concentration for drinking water. Of the ice samples collected, 72. 2 % were positive for presumptive coliform bacteria presence, and 88. 9 % of the soda samples were positive for presumptive coliform presence. No statistical significance was observed between the concentration of heterotrophic bacteria in ice samples (median = 202 CFU/ml) and soda samples (median = 775 CFU/ml). However, the presumptive coliform bacteria data did show that the soda samples (median = 139 CFU/ml) had a significantly higher concentration when compared to the ice samples (median = 3 CFU/ml). The type of food establishment from which the samples were collected did not have a significant influence on the bacteriological quality of the ice and soda. The findings of this study provide important evidence that could have public health implications and may influence future studies related to bacterial contamination of beverages sold in the Las Vegas Valley...|$|R

A lack of {{information}} is available about injury in ballet dancers {{and its relationship to}} the amount of compensation acquired with excessive movement in the joints of the lower extremities and lumbar spine during external rotation at the hips that is required in ballet. The {{purpose of this study was}} to look at the relationship between injury and compensation at the lumbar spine, knee, and ankle when moving from parallel to first position in adolescent dancers. Methods. Twenty-one adolescent dancers completed a self-reported injury survey and were measured with a rod and <b>plumb</b> line <b>device</b> for rotation at the hip, knees, and ankle, as well as with a flexible curve for lumbar spine movement. Results. Of the twenty-one subjects, twenty appeared to demonstrate compensation at the lower extremities and eleven appeared to demonstrate an increase in lumbar lordosis. No significant difference between the injured and noninjured groups was found in terms of compensation at the lower extremities or lumbar spine. Discussion and Conclusion. Although no significance was found, further studies should be conducted to determine if injury and compensation have a relationship...|$|R

Despite having grown to a population of 8.2 million in 2006, the city is now using 28% less water {{than it did in}} 1979. The drop in consumption is mostly a result of city policy; water-saving <b>plumbing</b> fixtures and <b>devices</b> in renovations and new construction are required, the city has been more diligent in finding and fixing leaks, and since the late 1980s it has been metering residential customers’ water use. The city uses sonar and other equipment to more efficiently find and fix leaks in its millions of feet of water mains and has taken steps like installing sprinkler caps on fire hydrants during the summer, letting overheated kids cool off without torrents of gushing water.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a decision-support system for domestic-water demand management (DMS). The developed system forms {{part of a}} highly integrated water resources management system for river basin (WaterWare). It comprises expert system, multi-decision component and on-line help files (hypertext file). The basic component {{of the system is}} the expert system which has the following main functions:- it controls the interface between user and the system;- it deduce the answers numerically and symbolically;- it explain why certain answer has been deduced;- it allows for tracing back the various steps used in the deduction process;- it links the hypertext files which are necessary to help user in a friendly way;- it links mathematical models which are necessary to deduce certain answer. The system estimates conservation effectiveness as a result of implementing certain conservation measure(s) in a given area and time period. The conservation effectiveness of each measure is determined from the following variables: potential reduction in water consumption due to certain measure, interaction effect between proposed measure(s) and existing measures and the penetration level of proposed measure in the demand area. Several conservation mea-sures are incorporated in the system these include; water metering, water rationing, pressure reduction, public education, water pricing, conservation <b>devices,</b> <b>plumbing</b> codes and water use restrictions. The system capabilities are demonstrated using the data of Swindon demand zone in Thames basin in the UK. ...|$|R
