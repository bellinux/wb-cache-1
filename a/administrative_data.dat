25|$|Responding in July 2014 to the National Statistical Authority, the Minister to the Cabinet Office {{welcomed the}} {{recommendations}} of a predominantly online census for England and Wales supplemented {{by the use of}} governmental and other <b>administrative</b> <b>data.</b> However, it was also made clear that whereas for 2021 a dual-running dicennial national census with <b>administrative</b> <b>data</b> gathering was viewed as an acceptable transitional approach the government did not seen this as the way forward post 2021. It asked the National Statistician to ensure sufficient research is undertaken and the feasibility of alternative methods validated in the run up to 2021 to replace the traditional national census and intermediate surveying approach from after that date. The Government also indicated it recognised the implications of greater data-sharing between government departments on public confidence in the security and privacy of their personal information.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The Social Security Administration (SSA) {{maintains}} a rich system of administrative record databases.

These matched data offer a unique possibility to both construct measures of total expenditure and to check directly on the reliability of our imputations. The results are promising. It gives clear indication that <b>administrative</b> register <b>data</b> on income, tax payments, and wealth can be used to construct a measure of total expenditure at the household level. ...|$|R
25|$|Initially, eight {{options were}} {{identified}} which were assessed. Following initial consideration {{it was found}} that some of the options had identical components so it was decided to redefine the options in the form of varying quality standards covering census, survey and <b>administrative</b> <b>data</b> aggregation, which would each be assessed in terms of accuracy, frequency and geography. In 2012 the second round of assessment commenced with six possible options identified for detailed investigation. The criteria for assessment of these options will comprise cost, technical feasibility, risk, public acceptability, and fitness for purpose.|$|E
25|$|Commentary by the ONS in May 2013 {{reported}} that initial assessment found:- Option 1, the Full Census produced high quality data but only every ten years but was expensive to produce though {{could be reduced}} through a move to predominantly an internet-based completion approach. Option 2, the rolling census and Option 3, the Short-form census have both been assessed as even {{more expensive than the}} full census. Of the three options making use of <b>administrative</b> <b>data,</b> option 5, with an annual rolling survey comprising around 4% of the population was the most cost-effective and produced the best quality data.|$|E
