Common laborers had their salaries subjected to a government cap, and the gauchos were arrested by Rivadavia for vagrancy and forced to work on public projects, usually without pay.|$|E

25|$|Valerie Arem of PCB Productions was {{the voice}} {{director}} for dubbing. Rather than recording as a team, each actor recorded their lines separately. Baker, Bailey and Willingham, the respective voices of Vincent, Catherine and Johnny, described the voice recording period as <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>experience,</b> reinforced {{by the fact that}} they were all old friends. Baker noted that it was a relative rarity for this to be the case in general voice acting. Ruff, the voice of Katherine, was helped in her performance by both Arem and Atlus staff. In contrast to the majority of Japanese game localizations, the lip movements for some cutscenes were adjusted so they would sync with the English voices. This was done to give the acting and performances a more natural feel. This meant that the voice actors had more freedom to adlib parts of their performance: a cited example was the fight between Katherine and Catherine, where the two actresses adlibed the majority of the characters' argument. The aim for realism also meant that the performances were more restrained than those given for Japanese anime, which leaned towards stylized performances. For real-time cutscenes, lines had to be matched with gestures and line lengths to within 0.2 seconds; the Atlus staff needed to go through the Japanese script and create a dedicated column for speaking times, then they acted out the lines themselves so they had a reference for the voice actors, and finally they would allow an actor to alter things a little to suit their performance and document those changes so the subtitles matched.|$|E

40|$|Background: Due to the {{profound}} and life-changing aspects of giving birth {{and to each}} woman’s individualized birthing experience, {{it is important to}} understand the myriad of factors that contribute to <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> childbirth <b>experience.</b> The aims of this study were to: (1) identify factors related to <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> childbirth experience; (2) to examine relationships among women’s perceptions and personal evaluations of their childbirth experience, stress associated with labor pain, support from the nursing staff, initial contact with the baby following birth, support from partners, education, age, and obstetric history; and (3) to identify predictors of <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> childbirth <b>experience.</b> Method: <b>A</b> cross-sectional correlational study was conducted using a sample of 122 new mothers recruited over a 3 -month period. Data were collected using self-report questionnaires. The three questionnaires used in this study consisted of: (a) the Questionnaire Measuring Attitude About Labor and Delivery Experience (QMAALD 29 items); (b) the Questionnaire Measuring Stress Associated with Labor Pain [SLPS (version 2) ]; and (c) Personal Information Questionnaire (Demographic data). The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the 29 item QMAALD in this study was. 82 and the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of the SLPS (version 2) in this study was. 89. The SPSS statistical software version 16. 0 for Windows was used for data analysis. Results: Participants reported a low degree of stress associated with labor pain and a moderate amount of support received from the nursing staff. They reported holding and touching their baby immediately after birth. <b>A</b> <b>positive</b> childbirth <b>experience</b> was inversely related to stress associated with labor pain. The reduction of stress due to support received from the nursing staff was found to be positively related to <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> childbirth. Education was related to <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> childbirth experience; but not a significant predictor of <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> childbirth <b>experience.</b> Maternal age, initial contact with the baby following birth, number of labor and delivery experiences, duration of labor, interventions during labor, attendance at prenatal classes, and support from a partner did not relate to <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> childbirth <b>experience.</b> The regression analysis results indicated that the stress associated with labor pain, the reduction of stress due to the support received from the nursing staff, and attendance at prenatal classes were significant predictors of <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> childbirth <b>experience.</b> Conclusion: Stress associated with labor pain and the reduction of stress due to support received from the nursing staff were key factors contributing to <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> childbirth <b>experience.</b> Further research is needed to better understand the factors influencing women’s positive perceptions of the childbirth experience...|$|R

Shatner disagreed with having a clear glass separation between Spock and Kirk during the death scene; he instead wanted a translucent divider allowing viewers to see only Spock's silhouette, but his objection was overruled. During Spock's funeral sequence Meyer wanted the camera to track the torpedo that served as Spock's coffin as it was placed in a long trough and slid into the launcher.
