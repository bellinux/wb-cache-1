5|$|According to Josephus, Alexander {{was shown}} the Book of Daniel {{when he entered}} Jerusalem, which {{described}} a mighty Greek king who would conquer the Persian Empire. This is cited <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> sparing Jerusalem.|$|E

5|$|In later medieval tellings of the war, {{the episode}} of Troilus and Briseida/Cressida is {{acknowledged}} and often given <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> Diomedes and Troilus to seek {{each other out}} in battle. The love story also becomes one that is told separately.|$|E

5|$|Kraft {{has been}} an avid golfer {{ever since he was}} {{introduced}} to the game in the 1940s by his friend and NASA colleague Sig Sjoberg. He cited the good golfing <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> staying in Houston after his retirement.|$|E
5|$|Langkow and {{his wife}} Stephanie have four children, and {{expressed}} a desire to put down roots in the city of Calgary <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> his decision to sign a long-term contract extension with the Flames in 2008 rather than test free agency.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{the general}} {{refusal of the}} Belgian police {{to assist in the}} Holocaust has been cited <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the {{comparatively}} high survival rate of Belgian Jews during the Holocaust.|$|E

5|$|On June 21, 2011, Kelly {{announced}} that he would be leaving NASA's astronaut corps and the U.S. Navy effective October 1. He cited the needs of his wife during her recovery <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> his retirement.|$|E
5|$|Rivett's body, {{which had}} been held for several weeks {{following}} the murder, was released to her family and cremated at Croydon crematorium on 18December 1974. A police spokesman cited Lady Lucan's desire not to upset the family <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> her non-attendance at the cremation.|$|E
5|$|In October 1963, {{three young}} boys {{turned up at}} a senior {{athletics}} meet in Geelong, Victoria. They approached official Trevor Billingham, but Billingham turned them away citing their youth <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> them not {{to be allowed to}} compete. A few months later, Billingham held a coaching camp for secondary school students. His camp had a lot of primary school students in attendance.|$|E
50|$|Three {{days after}} the {{disastrous}} 2005 season, Guzmán had eye surgery, which he credited <b>as</b> <b>a</b> prime <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> his resurgence in the following years.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, {{homosexuality}} {{was also used}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> valid <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> deportation in Australia. The nation specifically allowed for homosexual immigration in the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The {{company has}} been criticised for repeating plots, the inevitability of their happy endings, and a simple writing style, whereas fans cite {{predictability}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> key <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> reading.|$|R
5|$|Like other New World vultures, the Andean condor has {{the unusual}} habit of urohidrosis: it often empties its cloaca onto its legs and feet. A cooling effect through {{evaporation}} {{has been proposed}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> this behavior, {{but it does not}} make any sense in the cold Andean habitat of the bird. Because of this habit, their legs are often streaked with a white buildup of uric acid.|$|E
5|$|As the new emperor, Macrinus had to {{deal with}} the major threat of the Parthians, with whom Rome were {{currently}} at war. An indecisive battle at Nisibis is cited <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the opening of peace negotiations. Negotiations may have been favourable for both sides; Rome was being threatened by Armenia and Dacia, and the Parthians were far from home and low on supplies. The settlement, however, was viewed by many people as being unfavourable to Rome. The Roman historian Cassius Dio wrote that a concession of 200 million Sesterces was rendered to the Parthians in exchange for peace. Historian Andrew Scott doubts the credibility of this high figure, noting that Dio's records are frequently unreliable on finances. Regardless, the prevailing opinion accuses Macrinus of being cowardly and weak during negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Dvořák often adapted Bohemian {{folklore}} for his compositions, and {{his previous}} four symphonic poems {{were based on}} actual poems by the Czech poet Karel Jaromír Erben, especially Erben's collection of ballads Kytice. A Hero's Song broke away from this pattern of programmatic symphonic works, as Dvořák did not specify a specific accompanying text, and he only roughly outlined its plot in a later letter. The lack of a fixed programme has been hypothesized <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> its relative neglect when compared to Dvořák's other symphonic works. It has also been suggested that the work {{was intended to be}} autobiographical, an unusual approach for Dvořák. This was Dvořák's only symphonic poem that pursued Franz Liszt's idealized view of the genre, as Dvořák's other four works were based on eerie subjects not appropriate to Liszt's conception.|$|E
50|$|Muthesius {{identifies}} privacy <b>as</b> <b>a</b> key <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the clearly divided {{design of}} the house. The layout is separated into residential and servant's quarters to segregate the residents and employees.|$|R
50|$|West Virginia {{presently}} ranks 49th for {{the incidence}} {{and duration of}} breastfeeding in the U.S., with mothers citing a lack of support, even active discouragement, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> primary <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> stopping.|$|R
50|$|Foreign investors often cite Luxembourg's labour {{relations}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> primary <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> locating in the Grand Duchy. Unemployment in 1999 averaged less than 2.8% of the workforce, but reached 4.4% by 2007.|$|R
5|$|Following Australia's {{unlikely}} win at Headingley, the England selectors {{were widely}} condemned for {{their failure to}} choose a specialist wrist spinner to exploit the turning pitch. This was cited <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the hosts' loss, as the part-timer Compton was able to trouble the batsmen and generate opportunities for wickets, only to see them foregone because of missed catches and stumpings. In response, the English selectors made four changes to the team for the Fifth Test, one of these being the inclusion of leg spinner Eric Hollies. Their frequent changes to the team meant the hosts used a total of 21 players for the five Tests, and the repeated changes to personnel resulted in heavy criticism.|$|E
5|$|In Ahmedabad, Modi renewed his {{acquaintance}} with Inamdar, who was {{based at the}} Hedgewar Bhavan (RSS headquarters) in the city. After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, he stopped working for his uncle and became a full-time pracharak (campaigner) for the RSS, working under Inamdar. Shortly before the war, Modi {{took part in a}} non-violent protest against the Indian government in New Delhi, for which he was arrested; this has been cited <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> Inamdar electing to mentor him. Many years later Modi would co-author a biography of Inamdar, published in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Jose Brandao, a {{historian}} specializing in North American Native history, suggests that contemporary {{analyses of the}} Lachine Massacre continue to demonstrate cultural bias. Brandao criticizes historians Parkman, Charles McIlwain, and George Hunt for citing the growing dependence on European goods (which were, according to these historians, viewed by the Iroquois as superior to other goods) <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> Iroquois dissatisfaction and violence. Brandao dismisses this theory as a largely ethnocentric interpretation with little evidence to support it. Brandao also dismisses Hunt’s suggestion that natives, similar to the Europeans, waged wars for economic reasons.|$|E
2500|$|Referenced in Twilight Zone Season 1, Episode 21, titled [...] "Wong's Lost and Found Emporium" [...] (Aired Nov 22, 1985), <b>as</b> <b>a</b> central <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> {{the protagonist}} {{to have lost}} his compassion.|$|R
50|$|Fitch was a U.S. Marine Corps drill instructor, a {{fact that}} Larry Bird {{credited}} in his book Drive: The Story of My Life <b>as</b> <b>an</b> important <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> Bird's own strong work ethic.|$|R
5000|$|... Panama only {{declared}} its candidacy after fourteen rounds of inconclusive voting were already complete, having initially endorsed Costa Rica, citing {{the election of}} Ronald Reagan <b>as</b> <b>a</b> compelling <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> Panama's presence on the Council.|$|R
5|$|Nash, {{along with}} former Yahoo! {{president}} and fellow Victoria-native Jeff Mallett, are investors in Women's Professional Soccer, a soccer league that {{was launched in}} March 2009. Nash cited his twin daughters and wanting to have role models for them {{to look up to}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> supporting the league. Nash also co-hosted Showdown in Chinatown in 2008, an 8-on-8 charity soccer game held at Sara D. Roosevelt Park. He scored two goals in his team's 8–5 victory. Participants included Thierry Henry, Jason Kidd, Baron Davis, and Suns teammates Raja Bell and Leandro Barbosa.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the battle, Sparta and Athens were the two largest city-states in Greece. Once the Ionian revolt was finally crushed by the Persian victory at the Battle of Lade in 494 BC, Darius began plans to subjugate Greece. In 490 BC, he sent a naval task force under Datis and Artaphernes across the Aegean, to subjugate the Cyclades, and then to make punitive attacks on Athens and Eretria. Reaching Euboea in mid-summer after a {{successful}} campaign in the Aegean, the Persians proceeded to besiege and capture Eretria. The Persian force then sailed for Attica, landing in the bay near the town of Marathon. The Athenians, joined by a small force from Plataea, marched to Marathon, and succeeded in blocking the two exits from the plain of Marathon. The Athenians also sent a message asking for support to the Spartans. When the messenger arrived in Sparta, the Spartans were involved in a religious festival and gave this <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> not coming to aid of the Athenians.|$|E

It also boosted sales of the 3DS to just over 67,000 from just under 26,000 the {{previous}} week. By April, the game remained in the top five best-selling games with over 205,000 units sold. Going into May, it was cited by Nintendo <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> increased profits, alongside other titles such as Fire Emblem Awakening.

In North America, the game sold over 135,000 units, becoming one of the better-selling Nintendo products of the month. In the UK, the game came in seventh place in the all-format gaming charts. As of April 2013, the game has sold 1.18 million units, being the 10th best-selling title for the system at that time.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2013, Sony {{announced}} it lost $197 million for June, July, and August 2013, and largely blamed [...] "the box office flop {{of the movie}} White House Down <b>as</b> <b>a</b> key <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the weakness".|$|R
40|$|Background. Fever is {{a marker}} of {{potentially}} serious illness in returned travelers. Information about causes of fever, organized by geographic area and traveler characteristics, can facilitate timely, appropriate treatment and preventive measures. Methods.
