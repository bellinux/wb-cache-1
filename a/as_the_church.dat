5|$|A {{still more}} {{resonant}} {{aspect of his}} legacy was the uniform rewriting of Roman law, the Corpus Juris Civilis, which is still the basis of civil law in many modern states. His reign also marked a blossoming of Byzantine culture, and his building program yielded such masterpieces <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> of Hagia Sophia.

5|$|By the 1570s, an {{underground}} church was growing fast <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> of England became more Protestant and less bearable for Roman Catholics {{who were still}} a sizeable minority. Only one public attempt to restore the old religion occurred: the Rising of the Northern earls in 1569. It was a botched attempt; in spite of tumultuous crowds who greeted the rebels in Durham, the rebellion did not spread. The assistance they sought did not materialise, their communication with allies at Court was poor. They came nowhere near to freeing Mary Stuart, whose presence might have rallied support, from her imprisonment in Tutbury.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Schleiermacher, an {{influential}} nineteenth-century Reformed theologian, saw baptism {{as the way}} the church receives new members and taught that faith is a precondition for baptism. He was ambivalent about the practice of infant baptism, teaching {{that it was not}} an essential institution, but could be continued as long <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> was faithful in bringing children to confirmation. Schleiermacher also saw baptism as primarily individual rather than initiating one into a covenant community, and rejected the idea that baptism should be connected with Old Testament circumcision.|$|E

5|$|Many {{existing}} Wesleyan-holiness denominations {{adopted the}} Pentecostal message, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> of God (Cleveland, Tennessee), the Church of God in Christ, and the Pentecostal Holiness Church. The formation of new denominations also occurred, motivated by doctrinal differences between Wesleyan Pentecostals and their Finished Work counterparts, {{such as the}} Assemblies of God formed in 1914 and the Pentecostal Church of God formed in 1919. An early doctrinal controversy led to a split between Trinitarian and Oneness Pentecostals, the latter founded the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World in 1916.|$|E
5|$|St Paul's, {{commonly}} known as the Actors' Church, was built in 1633, at a cost of £4,000, though was not consecrated until 1638. In 1645 Covent Garden was made a separate parish and the church was dedicated to St Paul. How much of Jones's original building is left is unclear, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> was damaged by fire in 1795 during restoration work by Thomas Hardwick; the columns are thought to be original but the rest is mostly Georgian or Victorian reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|The Russians, {{unlike the}} British and Americans, endeavoured {{to convert the}} natives to Christianity. Many Aleuts joined the Russian Orthodox Church. Russian missionaries founded a number of churches for the natives, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> of the Holy Ascension in Unalaska. A notable Russian missionary was Saint Innocent of Alaska. For {{his work as a}} missionary, bishop, and later {{archbishop}} in Alaska and the Russian Far East he was canonized.

5|$|The {{original}} church {{within this}} movement, founded in April 1830 in New York by Joseph Smith, was the Church of Christ, which was later named the Church of the Latter Day Saints. It was renamed the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1838 (stylized <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the United Kingdom), which remained its official name until Smith's death in 1844. This organization subsequently splintered into several different denominations, {{each of which}} {{claims to be the}} legitimate continuation of this original church, and most of which dispute the right of other denominations within the movement to claim this distinction.|$|E
5|$|The wars {{destroyed}} the old civilian bureaucracy that had governed {{the region for}} centuries, as {{institutions such as the}} audiencias were eliminated and many Peninsular officials fled to Spain. The Catholic Church, which had been an important social and political institution during the colonial period, initially came out weakened {{by the end of the}} conflicts. As with government officials, many Peninsular bishops abandoned their dioceses and their posts were not filled for decades until new prelates could be created and relations between the new nations and the Vatican were regularized. Then <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> recovered, its economic and political power was attacked by liberals.|$|E

5|$|After 1935, {{the mines}} were reopened {{and there was}} steady growth in the region. According to David M. Gordon, the unrest gave missionaries {{a chance to respond}} to the Watchtower {{movement}} in a coordinated fashion. The London Missionary Society and the Church of Scotland worked together after the strike, saying that the lack of education and religious instruction were contributing factors. The missionaries and the mining companies said that a Christian education would create a disciplined workforce, a belief which was called the spiritual wing of industrial capitalism. The region's Protestant mission established the United Mission of Copperbelt (UMCB), which led to the establishment of Protestant bodies such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> of Central Africa in Rhodesia (CCAR) in 1945 and the United Church of Central Africa in Rhodesia in 1958 (which became the United Church of Zambia in 1965).|$|E
5|$|Hensley {{was arrested}} in Tennessee on moonshine-related charges during the Prohibition era and sentenced to a term in a workhouse, from which he escaped and fled the state. Hensley {{traveled}} to Ohio, where he held revival services, though {{he and his family}} rarely stayed long in one location. He established churches, known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> of God with Signs Following, in Tennessee and Kentucky. His services ranged from small meetings held in houses to large gatherings that drew media attention and hundreds of attendees. Although he conducted many services, he made little money, and he was arrested for violating laws against snake handling at least twice. During his ministry, Hensley claimed to have been bitten by many snakes without ill effect, and {{toward the end of his}} career, he estimated that he had survived more than 400bites. In 1955, while conducting a service in Florida, he was bitten by a snake and became violently ill. He refused to seek medical attention and died the following day. Despite his personal failings, he convinced many residents of rural Appalachia that snake handling was commanded by God, and his followers continued the practice after his death. Although snake handling developed independently in several Pentecostal ministries, Hensley is generally credited with spreading the custom in the Southeastern United States.|$|E

She acknowledged {{the church in the}} game holds a resemblance to Manchester Cathedral, but that the point was to depict a backdrop of an old church, not to illustrate a specific church. She added that Sony understands why the Church of England was offended especially because of its efforts to reduce the serious problem of gun violence in Manchester. She did not answer on whether Sony would donate money to the Cathedral's anti-gun program <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> has demanded.

5|$|St Mary the Virgin's Church {{has been}} in {{existence}} since the 12th century and probably much earlier. It was once known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> of St Peter at Westleigh in Leigh, and straddles {{the boundary between the}} old townships of Westleigh and Pennington, the nave and churchyard, in Westleigh and the chancel in Pennington. Its early history is connected with the Westleigh and Urmston families. Its dedication changed to St Mary the Virgin in the 14th century. The church tower, said to have been built in 1516, is all that remains of the medieval structure, which was replaced by the present church after becoming unsafe. Paley and Austin of Lancaster designed the present church, the foundation stone was laid in 1871 and the church consecrated in 1873. The church is built in red sandstone it is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} Tkach’s tenure {{as the head}} of the WCG was notable. Church income dropped from a high of over $200 million in 1990 to $50 million by 1996. By then the church could only count 49,000 as members, less than half from its peak. The {{circulation}} of The Plain Truth, distributed free by subscription and via newsstand distribution around the globe, fell from a peak of 8,000,000 to less than 100,000 before it switched to a paid subscription status. Eventually the magazine was spun off into a separate, independent, evangelical ministry. The number of employees at the church headquarters fell from 1,000 to about 50. Ambassador University, as the college had become after earning regional accreditation in Texas, ceased operations in 1997 <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> could no longer provide its annual operating subsidy. The Pasadena campus was finally sold in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The two strongest {{succession}} {{candidates were}} Brigham Young, senior member {{and president of}} the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and Sidney Rigdon, the senior member of the First Presidency. In a church-wide conference on August 8, most of the Latter Day Saints elected Young, who led them to the Utah Territory <b>as</b> <b>The</b> <b>Church</b> of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Membership in Young's denomination surpassed 14 million members in 2010. Smaller groups followed Sidney Rigdon and James J. Strang, who had based his claim on an allegedly-forged letter of appointment. Others followed Lyman Wight and Alpheus Cutler. Many members of these smaller groups, including most of Smith's family, eventually coalesced in 1860 under the leadership of Joseph Smith III and formed what was known {{for more than a century}} as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (now Community of Christ), which now has about 250,000 members. , members of the denominations originating from Smith's teachings number approximately 15 million.|$|E
