The whole life history of the focused pulses is then reconstructed by means of numerical simulations. We show that beam breakup leads to a dual-rate increase in filament numbers with laser power. Linearly and circularly polarized pulses give rise to beam breakup and fusion governed by external focusing conditions. For tight focusing conditions, intensity saturation due to plasma generation and nonlinear losses does not limit the intensity growth, thereby giving access to a new propagation regime featured by an efficient laser energy deposition in fully ionized air and intense 10 ^ 15 W/cm^ 2 pulses at the focus...|$|R

50|$|In the {{earliest}} {{part of the}} bronze age, tribal leaders and other important people were buried in the mounds encased in a hollowed out oak log. Often the mounds were used multiple times, with both early oak log burials and later urn burials found in the same mound. The Bronze Age {{in what is now}} Denmark was in many ways an international affair with import of copper and tin from far away for bronze production, and export of cattle. Archeologists reckon that the burials changed from coffin burials to cremation due to international influence. A hallmark of the turf built bronze age mounds is that a layer of metallic oxides tended to wash out from the top turf creating a hard and <b>air</b> <b>tight</b> cap isolating the inner mound from the atmosphere. This <b>air</b> <b>tight</b> lid prevents decay of the burials due to oxidation including protecting offerings accompanying the deceased inside the mounds.|$|E
50|$|More recently, {{tubeless}} clincher tires {{have become}} popular after their successful presence on mountain bikes {{for the last}} several years. Advantages include lower overall wheel weight (no inner tube), lower tire pressures allowing for more traction without risk of a 'pinch flat' and no glue as required for tubular tires. It should be noted that not all clincher rim designs allow for tubeless tires as an <b>air</b> <b>tight</b> contact surface is required to prevent the unintended loss of tire pressure.|$|E

5000|$|Ventilation {{should be}} {{considered}} for its relationship to [...] "venting" [...] for appliances and combustion equipment such as water heaters, furnaces, boilers, and wood stoves.

[...] She wrote in the score program notes: The work is an expression of imagined scenes played out here. A rainbow seen at night can be referred to as a black rainbow; difficult to see, the colors are often hidden; a metaphor for something sought after but impossible to attain, an alluring ongoing search. She also described the nature of the two movements, adding, [...] "The first movement is dark and ritualistic. It’s mid summer and the <b>air</b> is <b>tight,</b> uncomfortable.

50|$|From {{an energy}} point of view, {{it is almost}} always {{desirable}} to increase air tightness, but if infiltration is providing useful dilution of indoor contaminants, indoor air quality may suffer. However, it is often unclear how useful this dilution is because building leaks cause uncontrolled airflows and potentially poorly ventilated rooms although the total building air exchange rate may be sufficient. This adverse effect has been confirmed by numerical simulations in the French context which has shown that typical mechanical ventilation systems yielded better indoor <b>air</b> quality with <b>tighter</b> envelopes.|$|R

50|$|Seeds stored {{hermetically}} {{have shown}} to exhibit prolonged quality. Researches in Ghana investigated {{the effectiveness of}} storing seeds using three different types of grain storage. The three methods used in the research included the jute, polypropylene and triple layer hermetic storage. Two destructive insects pests, Adult Prostephanus truncatus and Sitophilus were infested in each bag. These two insects pests are common in Africa and are very destructive to maize. Unprotected maize in storage can be totally annihilated by these organisms. Of these three methods, the triple layer hermetic storage offered outstanding results of seed quality with prolonged germination rate and viability despite insect infestation. Additionally, to ensure that grain maintains its natural quality in storage, {{it has to be}} stored at optimal moisture contents of approximately 12 -14% and preferably low moisture content. The bags have to be sealed for the entire period of storage and regular check ups need to be down to ascertain that the seal remains intact i.e. very <b>air</b> <b>tight</b> bags. Another study investigated the efficacy of controlling bean pests i.e. Acanthoscelides obtectus on the quality of beans by employing the hermetic storage system (silo bags and plastic bottles) and non-hermetic glass containers. Beans were stored at high moisture contents of 15%, temperature 25 C and relative humidity 70± 5%. In the study the hermetic method showed no alteration in quality.Deterioration in grain quality arises from several factors (1) high moisture content at the time of storage. High grain moisture content promotes development of molds which renders the grains unusable or unsafe for consumption. (2) failure to keep storage bags <b>air</b> <b>tight</b> from oxygen which would otherwise accelerate insect infestation leading to total destruction of grain. In this phenomenon, hermetic conditions are not met to secure the grain from insects. (3) Failure to keep the bags water tight to prevent moisture infiltration, (4) high temperatures leading to grain discoloration and largely insect infestation.|$|E

On April 10, however, Lawrence wrote to Watt to inform him [...] "that evening at about four o'clock we put the engine to work and mean to continue working it for some time". The former hoped {{that this would be}} for at least 3 months. In December, a further letter confirmed that the engine [...] "goes very prosperously being steam and <b>air</b> <b>tight</b> but that the boiler is very bad".

40|$|Flat {{collectors}} {{are usually}} not <b>air</b> or water <b>tight.</b> Therefore, they can exchange air and moisture with the environment.

An optimised ventilation rate, which {{is a measure of}} the air exchange between the collector and the environment, with respect to the moisture absorption properties of the thermal insulation materials helps to keep the collector dry. Optimum might be a relatively high ventilation if the collector case is not designed to be completely tight...|$|R
25|$|Following its introduction, the MacBook Air {{was greeted}} with a mixed reception. The {{portability}} of the MacBook Air was praised in reviews, but the compromise in features was criticized.

2500|$|However, {{on third}} down (the second {{play of the}} second quarter), Morrall's pass was tipped by Jets linebacker Al Atkinson, bounced crazily, high into the <b>air</b> off <b>tight</b> end Tom Mitchell, and was intercepted by Jets cornerback Randy Beverly {{in the end zone}} for a touchback. [...] "That was the game in a nutshell," [...] says Matte. Starting from their own 20-yard line, Snell rushed on the next 4 plays, {{advancing}} the ball 26 yards. The Jets would have success all day running off left tackle behind the blocking of Winston Hill, who, according to Snell, was overpowering 36-year-old defensive end Ordell Braase, the man who had tormented the rookie Hill in Colts' training camp. Said Snell, [...] "Braase pretty much faded out." [...] Namath later completed 3 consecutive passes, moving the ball to the Colts 23-yard line. Boozer gained just 2 yards on the next play, but Snell followed it up with a 12-yard reception at the 9-yard line and a 5-yard run to the 4-yard line, and capped the drive with a 4-yard touchdown run, once again off left tackle. The score gave the Jets a 7–0 lead, and marked {{the first time in history}} that an AFL team led in the Super Bowl.|$|R

5000|$|General {{technique}} for NPWT is as follows: [...] "protect the periwound by applying a skin barrier {{then it should}} {{be followed by a}} transparent film." [...] a dressing or filler material is fitted to the contours of a wound (which is covered with a non-adherent dressing film) and the overlying foam is then sealed with a transparent film. A drainage tube is connected to the dressing through an opening of the transparent film. A vacuum tube is connected through an opening in the film drape to a canister {{on the side of a}} vacuum pump. or vacuum source, turning an open wound into a controlled, closed wound while removing excess fluid from the wound bed to enhance circulation and remove wound fluids. This creates a moist healing environment and reduces edema. [...] "There must be an <b>air</b> <b>tight</b> seal in order for this therapy to be successful." [...] The technique is usually used with chronic wounds or wounds that are expected to present difficulties while healing (such as those associated with diabetes).|$|E
50|$|Excess salt {{solution}} is then {{removed from the}} fibers through squeezing or centrifuging prior to further processing. After the drying process, edible binders such as proteins, starches, cereals, dextrins, carboxy methyl cellulose, {{or a combination of}} them, are added to keep the fibers physically tied together through functioning as an adhesive or serving as a matrix in which the fibers embed upon. The fibers are then passed through a bath of melted fat and proceed to be pressed together to form the final product. The meat analog is then cut into suitable length for either packaging and distribution or further processing. Overall this method allows for the desirable formation of highly fine fibers, but at the cost of longer and more complicated processing steps, as well as incurring an increase in cost. Regardless of which method was used, the final product should be stored under at temperatures ranging from 13 °C to 21 °C. Ideally the humidity should be around 15%. The expected shelf life of meat analog products while in an <b>air</b> <b>tight</b> package is up to 10 years, while it its only up to 1 year when it has been opened.|$|E
50|$|As expected, {{the bulk}} of the field was in GT: 27 cars in GT1 plus 12 in GT2. Many teams came from the {{thriving}} BPR Global series.

40|$|Residential {{construction}} {{practices are}} progressing toward {{higher levels of}} energy efficiency. A proven strategy to save energy is to simultaneously increase building insulation levels and reduce outdoor <b>air</b> infiltration. <b>Tight</b> homes require intentional mechanical ventilation to ensure healthy indoor air. Overall, this strategy results in {{a shift in the}} mix of latent and sensible space conditioning loads, requiring proportionally more moisture to be removed compared to standard homes. There is currently not sufficient information available at a wide enough range of operating points to design dehumidification systems for high performance homes in hot-humid climates. The only industry information available on dehumidifier moisture removal and energy consumption are performance ratings conducted at a single test condition, which does not provide a full representation of dehumidifier operation under real-world conditions. Winkler et al. (2011) developed steady state performance maps to predict dehumidifier performance at a variety of indoor conditions. However, installed heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) equipment rarely operates at steady state. Part load performance testing of residential dehumidifiers is not mandated by current test standards. Therefore, we tested the part load performance of four residential dehumidifiers in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) Advanced HVAC Systems Laboratory. The part load efficiency of each dehumidifier was measured under 13 cycling scenarios, and combined with NREL field data to develop part load fraction (PLF) performance curves under realistic cycling scenarios...|$|R
