5|$|In 1917, Providence College {{was founded}} as an all-male school {{through the efforts}} of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence and the Dominican Province of St. Joseph.

5|$|Middleton {{stayed at}} LSU until 1942, {{describing}} {{his days as}} the comptroller of LSU as long days {{that he would not}} want to relive, but after the first year he found both the work and his association with Hebert, Borth and Hornbeak to be satisfying and rewarding.

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the second}} day, the Seimas adopted a four-{{paragraph}} resolution. The first paragraph declared that the Tsarist government was Lithuania's most dangerous enemy. The second paragraph demanded autonomy; the third outlined the means towards this goal that were deemed acceptable. The resistance was to be peaceful and passive. The fourth and final paragraph demanded that children be taught in their native language by teachers chosen by the people. The Seimas, unlike the 1917 Vilnius Conference, did not attempt to elect <b>an</b> <b>institution</b> <b>that</b> could carry out these resolutions and act as a Lithuanian government. After the Seimas, rural areas were left on their own without central guidance. After the resolution was adopted by the Seimas, near midnight, Jonas Basanavičius read aloud his proposal to include an attachment condemning Polish ecclesiastical authorities for suppressing the use of the Lithuanian language in churches within the diocese of Vilnius. The church matters had not been discussed during the sessions, but the majority agreed to the proposal by a show of hands. Because the attachment was not fully discussed, Social Democrats did not consider it officially adopted.|$|E
5|$|The {{woodwork}} {{removed by}} Street was sold for a nominal sum, with {{a condition that}} {{it could only be}} used for a hall, chapel or library. Some pieces ended up in the library and chapel of Forest School in Walthamstow, east London (<b>an</b> <b>institution</b> <b>that</b> previously had no link to the college). Panels under the communion rail were also removed from the chapel, even though Street had reported to the college that these carvings were the only portion of the chapel woodwork with any real value, and had suggested at one point reusing them in connection with the ante-chapel screen and the adjoining seats. Some of the woodwork was transferred to St Edern's Church, Bodedern, in Anglesey, which had links with the college from 1648 until the Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920. Some of the panels may also have been re-used in the Fellows' Library (in the second quadrangle); other panelling at Bodedern came from the college, but not apparently from the chapel, and so may have been from a disused library gallery.|$|E
