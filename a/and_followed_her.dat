5|$|Bader {{attended}} Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, {{where she}} was a member of Alpha Epsilon Phi. While at Cornell, she met Martin D. Ginsburg at age seventeen. She graduated from Cornell with a Bachelor of Arts degree in government on June 23, 1954. She was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and the highest-ranking female student in her graduating class. Bader married Martin Ginsburg a month after her graduation from Cornell <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>her</b> new husband to Fort Sill, Oklahoma where he was stationed as a Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) officer in the Army Reserve after he was called up for active duty. At age twenty-one, she worked for the Social Security Administration office in Oklahoma {{where she was}} demoted after becoming pregnant with her first child. She gave birth to a daughter in 1955.|$|E
5|$|A {{variation}} of this origin of Chamba {{is that it}} originated as a hermitage which Champavati, a devout Hindu, used to frequent. The king, being suspicious of his daughter's fidelity, one day investigated <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>her</b> to the hermitage, but surprisingly he found neither his daughter nor the hermit there. Suddenly he {{was said to have}} heard a voice which informed him that his suspicions were ill-founded, admonishing him and informing him that his daughter had been taken away from him permanently as a punishment for his lack of trust in her morals. The King, fully chastened, sought redemption for his sin by expanding the hermitage into a temple, named in his daughter’s honour and built a city around the temple. Today this temple, called the Champavati Temple, belongs to the Royal family and the King’s daughter is venerated as a goddess. Every year, since 935, the Minjar festival or fair has been held. It lasts for 21 days, coinciding with the first day of Baisakhi.|$|E

25|$|The witch Circe later {{entered the}} Amazons' {{protected}} dimension and revived Queen Hippolyta from death.

Artemis and Philippus were assigned to oversee the battle, but soon lost faith in Hippolyta when they discovered some of her actions against Man's World proved to be less honorable. Due to their failure to follow-through in stopping Hippolyta during the war, a disguised Granny Goodness cursed all of the Amazons by erasing their memories and scattering them across the globe with false personas.

500|$|Clarence Edward Smith (February 22, 1928– June 13, 1969), {{better known}} by his assumed names Clarence13X and Allah, was an American leader {{and founder of}} the Five-Percent Nation.

500|$|Lennon {{was born}} in war-time England, on 9 October 1940, at Liverpool Maternity Hospital, to Julia (née Stanley) and Alfred Lennon. His father was a {{merchant}} seaman of Irish descent who was away {{at the time of}} his son's birth. His parents named him John Winston Lennon after his paternal grandfather, John [...] "Jack" [...] Lennon, and Prime Minister Winston Churchill. His father was often away from home but sent regular pay cheques to 9Newcastle Road, Liverpool, where Lennon lived with his mother; the cheques stopped when he went absent without leave in February 1944. When he eventually came home six months later, he offered to look after the family, but Julia—by then pregnant with another man's child—rejected the idea. After her sister Mimi complained to Liverpool's Social Services twice, Julia gave her custody of Lennon. In July 1946, Lennon's father visited her and took his son to Blackpool, secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him. Julia followed them—with her partner at the time, 'Bobby' Dykins—and after a heated argument his father forced the five-year-old to choose between them. Lennon twice chose his father, but as his mother walked away, he began to cry <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>her,</b> although this has been disputed. According to author Mark Lewisohn, Lennon's parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home as Alf left again. A witness who was there that day, Billy Hall, has said the dramatic scene often portrayed with a young John Lennon having to make a decision between his parents never happened. It would be 20 years before he had contact with his father again.|$|E

At the age of around 16years, Nanak started working under Daulat Khan Lodi, employer of Nanaki's husband.

2500|$|Lilian [...] "Lillie" [...] Belle Bridgman (18661948) was an American {{scientist}} and architect. She was an independent person and pursued her goals with determination. As a child, {{she had fallen}} from a barn roof and broken her leg {{which resulted in a}} lifelong impairment because there had been no doctors nearby to properly set the bones. This condition may have changed her focus from helping with outdoor farm work to studying, writing and reading. It did not prevent her from hiking in the Berkeley Hills and the Sierras using a crutch. After working first as a science teacher and writer, she changed her profession in mid-life <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>her</b> dream of becoming an architect.|$|E

He stated that he got up that night around 2a.m., leaving his wife asleep at home, and drove through Queens to find a victim. He saw Genovese {{on her way home}} <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>her</b> to the parking lot before killing her. He also confessed to murdering and sexually assaulting two other women and to committing between 30 and 40 burglaries. Subsequent psychiatric examinations suggested that Moseley was a necrophile.|$|E

2500|$|By 1980 Cold Chisel was {{the biggest}} band in Australia and Barnes had {{developed}} a notorious reputation as a hard-drinking wild man who reportedly drank more than two bottles of vodka a day, much of it onstage during performances. While in Canberra in November 1979 however, he met Jane Mahoney (born 1958 as Jane Dejakasaya, Bangkok, Thailand), the stepdaughter of an Australian diplomat. Barnes began a relationship with her and they started living together but in March 1980 {{she began to feel}} overwhelmed by the rock lifestyle <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>her</b> family to Tokyo where her father was posted. Barnes wrote the song [...] "Rising Sun" [...] about this, which would appear on the album East. The pair married in Sydney on 22 May 1981 and Jane soon gave birth to their first child Mahalia, named after Mahalia Jackson, on 12 July 1982. The couple have four children (Mahalia, Eliza-Jane, Elly-May and Jackie), who formed the group Tin Lids, and Barnes had already fathered a son, singer David Campbell, who, due to the young age of his parents {{at the time of his}} birth, was being raised by his grandmother, but while Barnes maintained contact with him, Campbell did not become aware that Barnes was his father and not merely a family friend until the mid-1980s.|$|E
2500|$|Press {{reported}} on November 6, 2006, {{the arrest of}} a construction worker Diego Pillco, a 19-year-old Ecuadorian illegal immigrant who according to police had confessed on tape to attacking Shelly, and then staging the fake suicide by hanging her. Pillco's original version of {{what happened was that}} when Shelly asked if the noise could be kept down, he threw a hammer at her and, afraid she would make a complaint that might result in his deportation, followed her back to her apartment, where the petite 40-year-old hit him, and was killed by a fall during a struggle. Subsequently, Pillco gave a completely different [...] account in which he said while on a break he had noticed Shelly returning to her apartment <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>her.</b> After assaulting her and rendering [...] her unconscious, he killed her by staging the fake suicide. The second version was consistent with the lack of dust on Shelly's shoes (which she was not wearing when found) and seemed to be a confession to murder, but prosecutors reportedly thought if charged with murder Pillco might return to his original account and a jury trial could find him guilty of a lesser charge. The medical examiner determined that Shelly was still alive when hanged. Pillco pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter and was sentenced to 25 years in prison without parole.|$|E
