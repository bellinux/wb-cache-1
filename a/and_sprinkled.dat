5|$|Kanafeh, a {{well-known}} dessert in the Arab World and Turkey. Made of several fine shreds of pastry noodles with honey-sweetened cheese in the center, {{the top layer}} of the pastry is usually dyed orange with food coloring <b>and</b> <b>sprinkled</b> with crushed pistachios. Nablus, to the present day is famed for its kanafeh, partly due to its use of a white-brined cheese called Nabulsi after the city. Boiled sugar is used as a syrup for kanafeh.|$|E
5|$|Genghis Khan (also {{known as}} Chinggis Khan) lost his {{battle against the}} Merkit (one of the major tribal confederations (khanlig) of the Mongols) and escaped death by seeking {{protection}} in the sacred precincts of the Burkhan Khaldun mountains. An old woman saved him and a few others. As mark of great reverence, which in Mongolia is considered a highly sacred mountain of spiritual significance, and to the sun above, he offered his respects to {{the spirits of the}} mountain around him, sprayed milk into the air <b>and</b> <b>sprinkled</b> it on the earth. He removed his girdle strap, unwinding it from his outfit, and then put it around his neck. Symbolically by this act he surrendered his Mongolian man's pride and expressed his submission to the gods.|$|E
5|$|Kanafeh is {{the most}} famed Nabulsi sweet. Originating in Nablus during the 15th century, by 1575, its recipe was {{exported}} throughout the Ottoman Empire — which controlled Palestine at the time. Kanafeh is made of several fine shreds of pastry noodles with honey-sweetened cheese in the center. The top layer of the pastry is usually dyed orange with food coloring <b>and</b> <b>sprinkled</b> with crushed pistachios. Though it is now made throughout the Middle East, to the present day, kanafeh Nabulsi enjoys continued fame, partly due to its use of a white-brine cheese called jibneh Nabulsi. Boiled sugar {{is used as a}} syrup for kanafeh.|$|E

25|$|According to the Mishnah, the {{ceremony}} {{of the burning}} of the red heifer itself {{took place on the}} Mount of Olives. A ritually pure kohen slaughtered the heifer, <b>and</b> <b>sprinkled</b> of its blood {{in the direction of the}} Temple seven times. The Red Heifer was then burnt on a pyre, together with crimson dyed wool, hyssop, and cedar wood.

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} they bound the Red Cow with a bast rope {{and placed it}} on the pile with its head towards the south and its face towards the west. The priest stood on the east side facing west. He {{slaughtered}} the cow with his right hand and received the blood with his left hand. But Rabbi Judah said that he received the blood with his right hand, put it on his left hand, and then sprinkled with his right hand. He dipped his finger in the blood <b>and</b> <b>sprinkled</b> it towards the Holy of Holies seven times, dipping once for each sprinkling.|$|E
25|$|The {{literary}} reunions {{attracted interest}} and became noisy banquets, {{the atmosphere of}} which is documented by Negruzzi's memoirs. He notes that Carp hardly ever consumed alcohol in public, but that, when he did, he was a sentimental drunk. The Junimea debates were lively <b>and</b> <b>sprinkled</b> with biting ad hominems. Young Carp casually addressed the audience with the insult gogomani ("dopes"), {{and it became a}} badge of pride for the oldest Junimists to have been identified as such. The inside joke was replicated among the more minor Junimists. They casually misspelled Carp's surname as Chirp (pretending to follow the obscure lexical theories of folklorist Ioan D. Caragiani); also, during one Junimea party, novelist Nicolae Gane staged a puppet show in which Carp and Maiorescu were the main characters.|$|E

25|$|In November 2011, {{the company}} {{announced}} {{that they would be}} adding espresso machines in 1,000 of their locations, later that month. Lattes were added to Ontario stores on November 14, 2011. In February 2012, they offered a new beverage, White Hot Chocolate, in select branches. On April 16, 2012, the brand launched frozen lemonade, in two flavours: original and raspberry. In May 2014, they first offered frozen green tea. On August 15, 2014, the company added a dark roast coffee blend as an alternative. In the summer of 2015, they introduced a frozen drink called Creamy Chocolate Chill which was essentially a chocolate milkshake topped with chocolate whipped cream and drizzled with chocolate syrup. In addition to the Creamy Chocolate Chill, they also launched a Maple Chill, a maple milkshake topped with regular whipped cream <b>and</b> <b>sprinkled</b> with maple flakes.|$|E
25|$|As {{the meal}} {{resulting}} from a slaughter offering was seen as holy, the guests were required to change their garments if possible; impurity would have excluded them from participation. Sometimes festive garments, which were seen as having sanctity, were borrowed for this purpose from the priests, and rings, having the significance of amulets, were worn in honour of the deity. Like the other types of sacrifice, the act began with the imposition of the offerer's hands onto the sacrificial animal, which would then be killed, and its blood collected <b>and</b> <b>sprinkled</b> upon the altar; however, slaughter offerings could be killed anywhere within the Temple Courtyard, {{not only on the}} north side of the altar. Oxen, sheep, and goats, are explicitly identified by the Biblical text as being used for slaughter offerings, but unlike other types of sacrifice, there was no rigid insistence that the animal be unblemished, or on the gender of the animal.|$|E

Chopped veal, ham, or crawfish tails may be added as well.|$|E

In the late 16th century, Suleiman ordered the {{construction}} of an imposing fortress wall to be built around the entire city, which still stands today. At the time, Jews received official permission to worship at the site and Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan built an oratory for them there. In 1625 organised prayers at the Wall are mentioned for the first time.|$|E

Its laziness is demonstrated in the first 21 seconds, during which Lavigne holds a plush stack of cupcakes, shakes her hips, stares at the cupcakes, bounces her shoulders, and then, when she sings the line 'Someone chuck a cupcake at me'... tosses the fake cupcakes at the camera, her lip movement not matching up to the backing track whatsoever." [...] Alexa Camp of Slant Magazine called it [...] "truly eyebrow-raising, taking cultural mis-appropriation to cringe-inducing levels." [...] The Independent suggested that [...] "'Hello Kitty' will make your eyes and ears bleed", while Jezebel wrote: [...] "It looks like what would happen if someone scraped off the diseased underbelly of American pop culture from 2004-2010 <b>and</b> <b>sprinkled</b> it generously over a festering pile of garbage." ...|$|E
