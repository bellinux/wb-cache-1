40|$|The {{dissemination}} of scholarly information through scholarly publishing {{is one of}} the most important requirements to be successful in academia. Approximately 25 - 45 % of nursing scholarship has at least one reference error. Reference inaccuracy occurs in scholarly publishing because most faculty authors focus more on the writing than on the accuracy of the references or these authors inadvertently miss the reference errors. Nevertheless, inaccurate references hinder the retrieval of material if author names are misspelled or the year or volume number is incorrect. Also, this lack of precision can raise questions about the accuracy of other parts of the material and the overall quality of the faculty scholarship. There are various strategies that authors can use to ensure reference accuracy: (a) the use of <b>a</b> <b>reference</b> <b>manager</b> software program ($ 100 -$ 200 /program), or (b) work with a copyeditor ($ 30 -$ 50 /hr). On the surface, the use of a copyeditor appears to be a more costly strategy than faculty use of <b>a</b> <b>reference</b> <b>manager</b> software. Also, many faculty do not have copyeditor skills; therefore, the use of a copyeditor may be the best strategy for faculty and university performance...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a CORBA-compliant middleware architecture {{that is more}} flexible and extensible compared to standard CORBA. The portable design of this architecture is easily integrated in any standard CORBA middleware; for this purpose, mainly the handling of object references (IORs) has to be changed. To encapsulate those changes, we introduce the concept of <b>a</b> generic <b>reference</b> <b>manager</b> with portable profile managers. Profile managers are pluggable and in extreme can be downloaded on demand. To illustrate {{the use of this}} approach, we present a profile manager implementation for fragmented objects and another one for bridging CORBA to the Jini world. The first profile manager supports truly distributed objects, which allow seamless integration of partitioning, scalability, fault tolerance, end-toend quality of service, and many more implementation aspects into a distributed object without losing distribution and location transparency. The second profile manager illustrates how our architecture enables fully transparent access from CORBA applications to services on non-CORBA platforms...|$|R
40|$|The {{choice of}} {{reference}} frames used in simulations is typically fixed in dynamic models based on modeling decisions made early during their development, restricting model fidelity, numerical accuracy and integration into large-scale simulations. Individual simulation components typically need {{to model the}} transformations between multiple reference frames in order to interact with other components, resulting in additional development effort, time and cost. This dissertation describes the methods for defining and managing different <b>reference</b> frames in <b>a</b> simulation, thereby creating a shared simulation environment that can provide reference frame transformations, comprising of kinematics and rotations, to all simulation components through <b>a</b> <b>Reference</b> Frame <b>Manager.</b> Simulation components can use this <b>Reference</b> Frame <b>Manager</b> to handle all kinematics and rotations when interacting with components using different reference frames, improving the interoperability of simulation components, especially in parallel and distributed simulation, while reducing their development time, effort and cost. The <b>Reference</b> Frame <b>Manager</b> also facilitates the development of Generic Dynamic Models that encapsulate the core service of dynamic model, enabling the rapid development of dynamic models that can be reused and reconfigured for different simulation scenarios and requirements.

The SEI developed <b>a</b> remediation <b>manager</b> <b>reference</b> implementation that demonstrates how evolving standards can communicate and process information on vulnerabilities, compliance issues, remediation policy, and remediation actions. An earlier report, Standards-Based Automated Remediation: <b>A</b> Remediation <b>Manager</b> <b>Reference</b> Implementation (CMU/SEI- 11 -SR- 007), described the project 2 ̆ 7 s concept, vision, scope, requirements, and the remediation manager implementation as of December 30, 2010.

The remediation manager can employ standards throughout the compliance issue remediation cycle. Using common formats and languages, the reference implementation ingests scan findings, extracts host compliance issues and vulnerabilities, maps them to remediation actions, builds remediation tasks, transmits remediation tasks to a Remediation Tool on a host system, and receives remediation task execution status from the Remediation Tool.
