5|$|Also in August 2014, 4chan was {{involved}} in the Gamergate controversy, which began with unsubstantiated <b>allegations</b> about indie game developer Zoë Quinn from an ex-boyfriend, followed by false <b>allegations</b> from anonymous Internet users. The <b>allegations</b> were followed by a harassment campaign against several women in the video game industry, organized by 4chan users.|$|E
5|$|Most of the <b>allegations</b> had not {{previously}} been reported to authorities, the reasons given included fear of disbelief and distrust in the judicial system. At least seven <b>allegations</b> of sexual assault made to police during Savile's lifetime were not linked by police, with Savile as the same alleged perpetrator. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said that the <b>allegations</b> made to Surrey Police between 2007 and 2009 could have resulted in prosecutions being undertaken.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Edward and Gaveston {{may have}} simply been {{friends with a}} close working relationship. Contemporary chronicler {{comments}} are vaguely worded; Orleton's <b>allegations</b> were {{at least in part}} politically motivated, and are very similar to the highly politicised sodomy <b>allegations</b> made against Pope Boniface VIII and the Knights Templar in 1303 and 1308 respectively. Later accounts by chroniclers of Edward's activities may trace back to Orleton's original <b>allegations,</b> and were certainly adversely coloured by the events at the end of Edward's reign. Such historians as Michael Prestwich and Seymour Phillips have argued that the public nature of the English royal court would have made it unlikely that any homosexual affairs would have remained discreet; neither the contemporary Church, Edward's father nor his father-in-law appear to have made any adverse comments about Edward's sexual behaviour.|$|E
50|$|Quinn sued TVNZ for {{defamation}} {{for both}} matters, and was awarded $400,000 for the horse doping <b>allegation,</b> and $1.1 {{million for the}} financial misconduct <b>allegation.</b>|$|R

50|$|On 9 March 2012, the Department of Work and Pensions {{announced}} it had 'been {{made aware of}} an <b>allegation</b> of attempted fraud {{in relation to a}} Mandatory Work Activity contract with A4e'. It stated that it had begun an investigation into this <b>allegation,</b> and also, {{as a result of the}} <b>allegation,</b> an 'independent audit of all our commercial relationships with A4e'.|$|R
5|$|Kaspersky's prior {{work for}} the Russian {{military}} and his education at a KGB-sponsored technical college has led to controversy about whether he uses his position to advance Russian government interests and intelligence efforts. According to Kaspersky, <b>allegations</b> of dubious connections with Russian agencies began after {{he got his first}} clients in America. He spends much of his working life trying to get governments and organizations to trust him and his software in spite of the <b>allegations.</b>|$|E
5|$|Moran joined Virginia Reps. Gerry Connolly and Bobby Scott {{in asking}} Attorney General Eric Holder for a Department of Justice {{investigation}} into <b>allegations</b> of voter fraud in Virginia following charges that a contractor to the Republican Party of Virginia was caught discarding completed voter registration forms in a Harrisonburg, Virginia dumpster. Shortly thereafter, conservative activist James O'Keefe released a video alleging involvement by Moran's {{son in a}} voting fraud discussion; see Voter fraud <b>allegations</b> below.|$|E

5|$|On , {{a senior}} army officer on active duty, Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice, {{prompted}} a second crisis {{when he went}} public with <b>allegations</b> that Lloyd George had lied to Parliament on military matters. Asquith, the Liberal leader in the House, took up the <b>allegations</b> and attacked Lloyd George (also a Liberal). While Asquith's presentation was poor, Lloyd George vigorously defended his position, treating the debate as a vote of confidence. He won over the House with a powerful refutation of Maurice's <b>allegations.</b> The main results were to strengthen Lloyd George, weaken Asquith, end public criticism of overall strategy, and strengthen civilian control of the military. Meanwhile, the German offensive stalled and was ultimately reversed. Victory came on 11 November 1918.|$|E
5|$|Presidential {{elections}} were again held in 2002 amid <b>allegations</b> of vote-rigging, intimidation and fraud. The 2005 Zimbabwe parliamentary {{elections were}} held on 31 March and multiple claims of vote rigging, election fraud and intimidation {{were made by}} the MDC and Jonathan Moyo, calling for investigations into 32 of the 120 constituencies. Jonathan Moyo participated in the elections despite the <b>allegations</b> and won a seat as an independent member of Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The {{institute}} did not {{execute the}} order and incumbent director Devi Singh who completed his six months of extension period, on September 8 did not leave office even after receiving the letter. As a result, there was confusion at IIM-L campus for almost a week. The <b>allegations</b> against Devi Singh, who served two term as director of IIM-L, ranges from nepotism to mismanagement of accounts. The Central Vigilance Commission also asked the HRD ministry to 're investigate' <b>allegations</b> of corruption against Devi Singh.|$|E

5000|$|In the US, {{plausible}} deniability {{is also a}} legal concept. It {{refers to}} lack of evidence proving an <b>allegation.</b> Standards of proof vary in civil and criminal cases. In civil cases, the standard of proof is [...] "preponderance of the evidence" [...] whereas in a criminal matter, the standard is [...] "beyond a reasonable doubt". If an opponent cannot provide evidence for his <b>allegation,</b> one can plausibly deny the <b>allegation</b> {{even though it may}} be true.|$|R
5|$|To a local reporter, Adidam {{threatened}} to file its own lawsuit against O'Mahoney, {{as well as}} five others who had been named in stories and interviews making <b>allegations</b> of abuse (no suit was ever filed).

5000|$|In March 2015, The Independent {{reported}} that Butler had reported former Conservative MP Enoch Powell as {{being involved with}} a Westminster paedophile ring in the 1980s (although there was no basis in fact for this <b>allegation).</b> Simon Heffer who has published a biography of Powell has described the <b>allegation</b> as a [...] "monstrous lie" [...] and criticised the Church of England's actions in [...] "putting this smear into the public domain".

5|$|After <b>allegations</b> {{that the}} design {{contractor}} had inflated {{costs for the}} tunnel {{in order to avoid}} sharing the job with an outside tunneling contractor, the long tunnel concept was revived in April 2006. The <b>allegations</b> led to calls for an outside cost estimate to determine more realistic tunnel costs. On May 15, 2006, Virginia Transportation Secretary Pierce R. Homer announced the creation of an advisory panel headed by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The panel had about two months to evaluate options for completing the line through Tysons Corner, with the results presented to the state on July 27, 2006 and published on July 31, 2006.|$|E

25|$|On September 1, 2009, Ventura County Superior Court Judge Kevin DeNoce {{ruled that}} the {{addition}} of a lying-in-wait <b>allegation</b> to the list of charges was acceptable. The addition of this <b>allegation</b> would automatically mean that the case must be heard in an adult court. The addition was petitioned, and in November the Ventura 2nd District Appellate Court denied the request to overturn the earlier ruling, finding that the District Attorney’s Office did not act vindictively in adding the lying-in-wait <b>allegation</b> to the murder charge.|$|R
5000|$|If the Defendant {{was aware}} of only two {{complaints}} that the Plaintiff had made to his wife, which related to a dog otherwise unconnected with the lawsuit, the Defendant would be very unwise to admit the <b>allegation.</b> Similarly, to either [...] "not admit" [...] or deny the <b>allegation</b> would invite a finding against himself on that point, and may lead to an award of costs. Accordingly, the Defendant could reasonably ask for the <b>allegation</b> to be better particularised so that he may plead to it properly.|$|R

Professor Ted Postol has accused the MIT administration since 2000 of attempting to whitewash potential research misconduct at the Lincoln Lab facility involving a ballistic missile defense test, though a final investigation into the matter has not been completed. Associate Professor Luk Van Parijs was dismissed in 2005 following <b>allegations</b> of scientific misconduct and found guilty of the same by the United States Office of Research Integrity in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Concerned that <b>allegations</b> of communists in the SCLC, if made public, would {{derail the}} administration's civil rights initiatives, Kennedy warned King to {{discontinue}} these associations, and later {{felt compelled to}} issue the written directive authorizing the FBI to wiretap King and other SCLC leaders. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover feared the Civil Rights movement and investigated the <b>allegations</b> of communist infiltration. When no evidence emerged to support this, the FBI used the incidental details caught on tape {{over the next five}} years in attempts to force King out of his leadership position, in the COINTELPRO program.|$|E
