500|$|After a month out of work, Westley rejoined Stevenage on 30 March 2013, {{his third}} spell in charge at the club. On the appointment, Stevenage {{chairman}} Phil Wallace stated [...] "Graham was keen {{to come back}} to Stevenage and, although I met some strong candidates, without doubt I think he’s the best man for the job right now. The club enjoyed a great deal of success before he left last year <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> forwards significantly in his time here on several levels". On his return, Westley said [...] "I'm really happy to be back, the training ground is fantastic, the club just keeps moving forward. All the facilities keep improving and I hope that I can come back and make another positive difference". In his first game back in charge of the club, Stevenage secured a 1–0 victory over Hartlepool United on 1 April. Stevenage ended the 2012–13 campaign in 18th-place, and Westley released four players and transfer-listed three others.|$|E
500|$|In February 2002, Lena Banks, a space {{advocate}} and founder/producer of Think Tank Ink Productions, contacted Lance Bass to propose {{his involvement in}} her Youngest Person in Space project. Banks brought her longtime associate David Krieff of Destiny Productions on board and {{through a series of}} events in August 2002, Bass entered cosmonaut training in Star City, Russia. Bass was considered as the US host of a space competition show to be entitled The Big Mission, which had been successful in Denmark, in which several contestants would go through rigorous training in order to win a seat on a Russian Soyuz space capsule. However, the game show concept was reconsidered, as the producers of the show decided it would be a much better idea to shoot a documentary of a celebrity actually training and going into space, and airing it on a major network. Lena Banks {{came up with the idea}} of the Youngest Person in Space many years before Dennis Tito had his historical flight. Through a series of events in early 2002 the chance of using Bass was presented when a colleague mentioned her space project to a friend and the friend's daughter shouted out, [...] "Lance Bass wants to go into space!" [...] The girl, who was an NSYNC fan, learned of Bass' lifelong dream of space travel when she read it online via a MTV forum. Lena Banks spoke to Lance Bass's management who then went to him with the proposal. [...] "At first he thought we were joking," [...] Lena Banks remarks. [...] "I assured him it was for real; he accepted <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> forward with the project." ...|$|E

60|$|Andries {{nodded his}} head, in sign of acquiescence, and thenceforth {{he seemed to}} aim at drawing things out, {{in order to gain}} time, instead of {{bringing}} them to a speedy conclusion.

6000|$|... "Yes, in the devil's name!" [...] {{replied the}} doctor, like a {{snapping}} turtle; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> {{on to the}} house. Notwithstanding his ungracious answer, he probably thought that, after the gastronomic performance of the day previous, it would hardly do to hang back.

60|$|I {{drew her}} into the {{adjoining}} cave. Thence {{we made our way}} to the mouth of the cave that had given me entrance to the cliff. Here I reconnoitered for a mo-ment, and seeing the coast clear, ran swiftly forth with Dian at my side. We dodged around the cliff-end, then paused for an instant, listening. No sound reached our ears to indicate that any had seen us, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> cautiously onward along the way by which I had come.|$|E
60|$|In {{the shop}} the sickly man was {{studying}} his smudgy newspaper, now spread out {{largely on the}} counter.

She remarked that she would send Anna with a note the {{first thing in the}} morning. I respected her taciturnity, silence being perhaps the best way to show my concern.|$|E
60|$|The enemy's shells, which {{occasionally}} burst on {{the advanced}} kopje, and a whistle of stray bullets from the left, advised us {{to change our}} position, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> a little further down the slope towards the river. Here the bridge was no longer visible. I looked towards the hill-top, whence the roar of musketry was ceaselessly proceeding. The Artillery had seen the slouch hats, too, and forgetting their usual apathy in the joy of a live target, concentrated a most hellish and terrible fire on the trenches.|$|E

40|$|Handheld {{displays}} leave {{little space}} for the visualization and navigation of spatial layouts representing rich information spaces. The most common navigation method for handheld displays is static peephole navigation: The peephole is static <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>move</b> the spatial layout behind it (scrolling). A more natural method is dynamic peephole navigation: here, the spatial layout is static <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>move</b> the peephole across it. In the experiment reported here, <b>we</b> compared dynamic <b>and</b> static peephole navigation in otherwise similar conditions. Subjects viewed a spatial layout containing two lines on a static display screen. Only {{a part of the}} screen [...] -the peephole [...] -was visible. Subjects had to discriminate line length by either moving a dynamic peephole across a static layout of the lines or by moving a dynamic layout behind a static peephole. In both conditions, they used mouse-cursor control to move either the peephole or the lines. Results show significant differences in discrimination performance between conditions when lines are larger than the size of the peephole. Discrimination thresholds for static peephole navigation were 50 [...] 75 % higher than for dynamic peephole navigation. Furthermore, static peephole navigation took 24 % more time than dynamic peephole navigation...|$|R

60|$|At all events, {{our place}} was bought, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> out, well pleased, {{the first morning}} in April, not at all remembering the ill savor of that day for matters of wisdom. Our place was a pretty cottage, about {{two miles from the}} city, with grounds that had been tastefully laid out. There was no lack of winding paths, arbors, flower borders, and rosebushes, with which my wife was {{especially}} pleased. There was a little green lot, strolling off down to a brook, with a thick grove of trees at the end, where our cow was to be pastured.|$|E
60|$|He {{had enjoyed}} The Holt, his New Jersey home, and was much {{interested}} in improving it. His neighbors and friends there were valued companions. But in his heart there {{had always been a}} longing for a home, not suburban--a place in the real country, and with more land. Finally, the time came when he felt that he could gratify this longing. He liked the Virginia climate, and decided to look for a place somewhere in that State, not far from the city of Washington. After a rather prolonged search, we one day lighted upon Claymont, in the Shenandoah Valley. It won our hearts, and ended our search. It had absolutely everything that Mr. Stockton coveted. He bought it at once, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> into it as speedily as possible.|$|E

60|$|It {{reminded}} me of the great hoot-owl, listening, after its booming cry, for the stir of its frightened prey. But we did not fir, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> only when he moved. And so we dodged about the deck, hand in hand, like a couple of children chased by a wicked ogre, till Wolf Larsen, evidently in disgust, left the deck for the cabin. There was glee in our eyes, and suppressed titters in our mouths, as we put on our shoes and clambered over the side into the boat. And as I looked into Maud’s clear brown eyes I forgot the evil he had done, and I knew only that I loved her, and that because of her the strength was mine to win our way back to the world.|$|E
60|$|Not one of {{our party}} spoke for several minutes. Astonishment seemed to hold us all tongue-tied, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> slowly forward into the {{fluttering}} throng, silent, absorbed, and full of admiration {{of the works of}} the Creator. It was not easy to hear each others' voices when we did speak, the incessant fluttering of wings filling the air. Nor were the birds silent in other respects. The pigeon is not a noisy creature, but a million crowded together on the summit of one hill, occupying a space of less than a mile square, did not leave the forest in its ordinary impressive stillness. As we advanced, I offered my arm, almost unconsciously, again to Dus, and she took it with the same abstracted manner as that in which it had been held forth for her acceptance. In this relation to each other we continued to follow the grave-looking Onondago as he moved, still deeper and deeper, into the midst of the fluttering tumult.|$|E
60|$|At a {{cool and}} early hour on a {{pleasant}} morning in July, my companion and I passed rapidly through Acton and Stow, stopping {{to rest and}} refresh us {{on the bank of}} a small stream, a tributary of the Assabet, in the latter town. As we traversed the cool woods of Acton, with stout staves in our hands, we were cheered by the song of the red-eye, the thrushes, the phoebe, and the cuckoo; and as we passed through the open country, we inhaled the fresh scent of every field, and all nature lay passive, to be viewed and travelled. Every rail, every farm-house, seen dimly in the twilight, every tinkling sound told of peace and purity, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> happily along the dank roads, enjoying not such privacy as the day leaves when it withdraws, but such as it has not profaned. It was solitude with light; which is better than darkness. But anon, the sound of the mower's rifle was heard in the fields, and this, too, mingled with the lowing kine.|$|E
50|$|A {{percentage}} of the gas we breathe (air) is always dissolved in our blood, like the gas dissolved in a soda bottle with the lid on. If <b>we</b> <b>move</b> to a higher ambient pressure, then the gas we breathe is at a higher pressure, and more of it dissolves in our blood and body tissues. If <b>we</b> <b>move</b> back to a lower pressure, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>move</b> slowly, then the extra gas comes out slowly until we are back to our normal amount of dissolved gas. But if <b>we</b> <b>move</b> quickly to a lower ambient pressure, then the gas comes out of our blood and tissues violently, in large bubbles, like {{to the difference between}} slowly opening a bottle of soda (dropping the pressure in the bottle slowly down to sea level), versus ripping the cap off quickly.|$|R
