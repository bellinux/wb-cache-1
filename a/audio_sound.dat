500|$|The studio {{recording}} on The Piper at the Gates of Dawn is the {{one that}} most listeners are familiar with, yet several other versions survive from both the recording studio and the stage. It was first recorded as a demo on 31 October 1966, recorded live-in-studio at Thompson Private Recording Company. This version was used as the <b>audio</b> <b>sound</b> to the film San Francisco, which was made by a friend of Barrett's, Anthony Stern. While filmmaker Peter Whitehead and his secondhand Stern were having a discussion, the topic about Pink Floyd was brought about by Stern, to which Whitehead told him, [...] "yeah, terrible music". Stern said that [...] "they're successful now", and suggest the pair go watch Pink Floyd, at their gig at the Royal College of Art. Whitehead recalled that they [...] "went to UFO and I liked them. Not connected to pop music, a long improvisatory quality, ideal for what I wanted." [...] Whitehead convinced Pink Floyd to record [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] for a film he was working on. Before turning up at the recording studio, the band held a rehearsal, and the next day, 11 January 1967, went to Sound Techniques studios. The studio, which was originally a dairy factory, was run by engineers Geoff Frost and John Wood.|$|E

40|$|Movie affective content {{detection}} attracts ever-increasing research efforts. However, {{the affective}} content analysis {{is still a}} challenging task due to the gap between low-level perceptual features and high-level human perception of the media. Moreover, clues from multiple modalities should be considered for affective analysis, since they were used in movies to represent emotions and romance emotional atmosphere. In this paper, mid-level representations are generated from low-level features. These mid-level representations are from multiple modalities and used for affective content inference. Besides video shots which is commonly used for video content analysis, <b>audio</b> <b>sounds,</b> dialogue and subtitle are explored to contribute to detect affective content. Since affective analysis rely on movie genres, experiments are implemented in respective genres. The results shows that <b>audio</b> <b>sounds,</b> dialogues and subtitles are effective and efficient for affective content detection...|$|R
