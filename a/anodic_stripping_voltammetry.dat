50|$|<b>Anodic</b> <b>stripping</b> <b>voltammetry</b> usually {{incorporates}} 4 steps if {{the working}} electrode is a mercury film or mercury drop electrode and the solution incorporates stirring. The solution is stirred {{during the first}} two steps at a repeatable rate. The first step is a cleaning step; in the cleaning step, the potential is held at a more oxidizing potential than the analyte of interest {{for a period of time}} in order to fully remove it from the electrode. In the second step, the potential is held at a lower potential, low enough to reduce the analyte and deposit it on the electrode. After the second step, the stirring is stopped, and the electrode is kept at the lower potential. The purpose of this third step is to allow the deposited material to distribute more evenly in the mercury. If a solid inert electrode is used, this step is unnecessary. The last step involves raising the working electrode to a higher potential (anodic), and stripping (oxidizing) the analyte. As the analyte is oxidized, it gives off electrons which are measured as a current.|$|E

40|$|Platinum-germanium {{catalysts}} {{supported on}} carbon were synthesised from organometallic precursors using surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC). The catalysts were characterised using chemisorption, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, X-ray diffraction and cyclic voltammetry. Physical characterisation provided {{evidence for the}} selective deposition of the germanium with the platinum using SOMC, existing mainly as platinum metal in association with GeO 2. From <b>anodic</b> <b>stripping</b> cyclic <b>voltammetry</b> it can be inferred {{that the presence of}} GeO 2, at the platinum sites changes the CO oxidation profile of strongly adsorbed CO, increasing its oxidation at 0. 68 V versus RHE relative to the main oxidation at 0. 85 V versus RHE. The peak potentials appear to be independent of the germanium loading; however, significant changes were observed in the peak current densities, with an increased promotional effect at higher germanium content. We believe the change in the relative distribution between these sites is mainly due to changes in the surface structure of the platinum on addition of GeO 2. Further promotional activity is seen, with a limited oxidation activity evident at an onset of 0. 35 V versus RHE. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
