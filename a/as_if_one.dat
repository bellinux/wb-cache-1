5|$|The game also {{provides}} a co-operative mode where two players may play through the game's campaign together via split-screen, system link, or through the Xbox Live online service. In co-operative, the missions are slightly altered to suit both players. For instance, some doors may require two players to open them. Additionally, in certain missions, the second player can occasionally start {{far away from the}} main player and takes over an allied character that was AI-controlled in the single player campaign. The respawn procedure is also altered substantially, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> player dies, the other has to find and revive the partner's corpse to bring it back to life.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they all}} share the forest, {{relationships}} between different Clans are tense. They often come {{into conflict with}} one another, becoming aggressive if a cat from a neighboring Clan accidentally crosses a border. This rivalry can increase in times of deprivation, such <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> Clan is suffering from a shortage of prey but another is thriving. An attempt for one Clan to steal all of or part of another Clan's territory is not unusual. To prepare for this, cats in all Clans are taught battle moves {{in order to protect}} their territory. Each Clan has signature battle moves that are taught to them from an early age (6 months/moons old). Border fights are the most common source of battle (a cat intentionally or unwittingly steps into another Clan's territory), and are often short-lived and cause no real damage to either side. However, bigger and more brutal battles can occur; at this point, casualties are to be expected. Despite this rivalry, the Clans can also show concern for another's well being; the idea of one Clan being destroyed causes deep distress, and will prompt urgent action on behalf of all four Clans. On the night of every full moon, the Clans will meet at a designated spot in order to share stories and news in peace. This is known as a 'Gathering', and is the only time in which fighting is prohibited.|$|E

Rav Huna taught that God said that engaging in the study of Mishnah is <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> were offering up sacrifices.

25|$|There {{are several}} ways to play six bells at a time (i.e., to ring three bells in each hand). One way is to pick two bells up <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> were Shelley ringing, then pick the third up between one's little and ring fingers (a 'triple Shelley'). All three bells ring {{together}} when ringing in a knocking motion. A second way is to pick up the third bell sideways so the clapper swings outward. Ringers with good control can then ring the first bell without ringing the third, allowing him or her to play three notes in one hand.|$|E
25|$|The Model {{is divided}} into three sections. In the first Scott defines poetry, making his debts to earlier theorists clear: All antiquity, {{following}} their great leader Aristotle, have defined poetry to be an art of imitation, or an instrument of reason, that consists in laying down the rules and way how in style to feign or represent things, with delight to teach to move us to good; <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> should say with the lyric Simonides (after whom Sir Philip Sidney saith) the poem is a speaking or wordish picture' (Cambridge edition, p. 6). Scott then discusses the 'genus' (matter), difference' (form) and 'end' of poetry in turn, dealing with such questions as the source of poetic inspiration, and the temperament required of the poet.|$|E
25|$|Many {{accounts}} {{state that}} both men fired in near perfect unison. Some stated it sounded <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> shot had been fired. “One witness said {{it looked as}} if the guns were spitting fire at the same time.” Then, a number of shots followed, ranging between five and nine according to different testimonies. As reports tell of a total of five entry wounds in the two men, the minimum number of shots fired had to be five. The exchange occurred rapidly. Reid received a bullet to one leg. Reid fired two more rounds, one grazing Smith’s left arm and the other striking his left thigh above the knee and exiting the other side. Chambering his Winchester, Smith sent a bullet into Reid’s lower abdomen and groin. Reid fell face down upon the planking, severely wounded. It is not known if Smith remained standing or also had fallen.|$|E

5000|$|Two homeomorphic spaces {{share the}} same topological properties. For example, <b>if</b> <b>one</b> of them is compact, then the other is <b>as</b> well; <b>if</b> <b>one</b> of them is connected, then the other is <b>as</b> well; <b>if</b> <b>one</b> of them is Hausdorff, then the other is as well; their {{homotopy}} and homology groups will coincide. Note however that this does not extend to properties defined via a metric; there are metric spaces that are homeomorphic even though {{one of them is}} complete and the other is not.|$|R
25|$|If cross-effects {{that result}} in {{diffusive}} transfer of internal energy were also labeled as heat transfers, they would sometimes violate the rule that pure heat transfer occurs only down a temperature gradient, never up one. They would also contradict the principle that all heat transfer is of {{one and the same}} kind, a principle founded on the idea of heat conduction between closed systems. One might to try to think narrowly of heat flux driven purely by temperature gradient as a conceptual component of diffusive internal energy flux, in the thermodynamic view, the concept resting specifically on careful calculations based on detailed knowledge of the processes and being indirectly assessed. In these circumstances, if perchance it happens that no transfer of matter is actualized, and there are no cross-effects, then the thermodynamic concept and the mechanical concept coincide, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> were dealing with closed systems. But when there is transfer of matter, the exact laws by which temperature gradient drives diffusive flux of internal energy, rather than being exactly knowable, mostly need to be assumed, and in many cases are practically unverifiable. Consequently, when there is transfer of matter, the calculation of the pure 'heat flux' component of the diffusive flux of internal energy rests on practically unverifiable assumptions. This is a reason to think of heat as a specialized concept that relates primarily and precisely to closed systems, and applicable only in a very restricted way to open systems.|$|E

500|$|The first {{movement}} {{begins with}} violas softly oscillating between the C and A notes; after four {{bars of the}} single, minimally-inflected line, a pair of bassoons enters with the initial theme. The beginning {{has been described by}} Nielsen scholar Robert Simpson, in his own words, as like [...] "in outer space" [...] and the wave-like line [...] "appears from nowhere, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> were suddenly made aware of time as a dimension". The very first theme ends at b.20 with a descending scale slide, followed by a fortissimo interruption from violas and a subsequent horn and flute dialogue. The prominent feature of instrumental pairing does not lead to any permanent thematic or textural stability, but contrarily grows into a persistent textural sparseness.|$|E

[...] Madeline Roth of MTV, called the song, [...] "a summer anthem in the making", and noted the song's themes of [...] "self-care" [...] and [...] "the importance of living stress-free". Writing for Vulture, Dee Lockett thought [...] "The Life" [...] generates a feeling <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> is [...] "floating on a summer breeze." [...] Lockett continues his review by acknowledging the success of Fifth Harmony's life, saying it is their [...] "God-given right of any young girl group" [...] to live {{the way they want}} to live. Lewis Corner and Amy Davidson from British entertainment website Digital Spy, listed the song at number one on their top 10 playlist songs, calling it an [...] "urban bop with an earworm refrain".

500|$|The {{producers}} {{learned from}} an ex-MI5 officer {{that it is}} common for intelligence gatherers who spend most of their work listening in to other people {{to fall in love with}} civilians through just their voices. This story was the basis of Ruth wanting to go out with John in [...] "Love and Death". Khoury based [...] "Outsiders" [...] on Internet security. He already became intoned with the area, as he once worked with an internet company. Although the story is dramatised, Khoury did research on what was feasible, such <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> man and a laptop could theoretically bring Britain to its knees. Also in the episode, the G algorithm is based on an actual computer programme. [...] "Frequently Asked Questions" [...] deals with interrogation and torture. Walters realised that torture is counterproductive as the suspects can say anything the interrogators want to hear, but rationalises that Adam is an expert in that field. To get the interrogation as true as possible, the producers consulted with ex-Army advisors who were trained in questioning terror suspects. As the episode was first broadcast, a prison abuse scandal in Iraq was put on the news. In response to this, Kudos director Stephen Garrett stated [...] "Spooks is really well researched and sometimes we look like we're ahead of the game. It's just we know stuff that's happening, and it'll come out in the news a bit later on."

500|$|The {{music video}} {{consists}} of a simplistic concept [...] a One Direction recording session. In a November 2012 interview with MTV News, Arnell {{said he did not}} want to make it about anything more than that, [...] "When I first heard the track, the mix on it was so simple and so pure and you could hear all the qualities of the voices on the track, I just wanted to come up with something that when the viewer watched it, it was almost like sitting there listening to the boys sing the track." [...] Arnell subsequently developed the idea of a recording studio setting, thinking that it was [...] "the most pure way to do it". He wanted to make the music video as [...] "uncontrived as possible" [...] without [...] "any other bullsh-- or effects in the way of it." [...] While Arnell conceded that music video may seem like a simple concept, the shoot itself took over twelve hours to complete and said that it was [...] "one of the hardest things I've ever done." [...] The group performed it [...] "over and over again because I was just trying to get different shots, different angles, different qualities." [...] As for the decision to shoot the video in black-and-white, Arnell felt it best captured the essence of the ballad. He also noted that was his intention to give the music video the feeling <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>One</b> Direction are singing it right to you, [...] "It's purely about the clarity of it. When you sit there watching it, it's almost like these little bits of eye contact [...] you really feel like the guys are singing it to you." ...|$|E
