From the Early and Middle Bronze Age there is evidence of cellular round houses of stone, as at Jarlshof and Sumburgh on Shetland. At Jarlshof these are oval houses with thick stone walls, which may have been partly subterranean at the earliest period of inhabitation, a technique that provided both structural stability and insulation. There is also evidence of the occupation of crannogs, roundhouses partially or entirely built on an artificial islands, usually in lakes, rivers and estuarine waters. They were often constructed of layers of brushwood and rubble. Sometimes they were revetted around the edges with vertical piles and sometimes surfaced with logs of oak.|$|E

As elsewhere in Europe, hill forts were first introduced in this period, including the occupation of Eildon hill near Melrose in the Scottish Borders, from around 1000 BCE, which accommodated several hundred houses on a fortified hilltop, and Traprain Law in East Lothian, which had a 20-acre enclosure, sectioned in two places west of the summit, made up of a coursed, stone wall with a rubble core.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the agricultural depression of the 1930s, the government encouraged domestic production by imposing tariffs on agricultural imports. This policy enjoyed some success: the total <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>cultivation</b> increased, and farm incomes fell less sharply in Finland than in most other countries. Barriers to grain imports stimulated a return to mixed farming, and by 1938 Finland's farmers were able to meet roughly 90 percent of the domestic demand for grain.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the late}} nineteenth century, Finland's {{isolation}} required that most farmers concentrate on producing grains to meet the country's basic food needs. In the fall, farmers planted rye; in the spring, southern and central farmers started oats, while northern farmers seeded barley. Farms also grew small quantities of potatoes, other root crops, and legumes. Nevertheless, the total <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>cultivation</b> was still small. Cattle grazed {{in the summer and}} consumed hay in the winter. Essentially self-sufficient, Finland engaged in very limited agricultural trade.|$|E
25|$|Irrigation {{has always}} played a {{significant}} role in the island's agriculture, and the need to continuously improve irrigation practices has long been recognized. Over the years some of the improvements which have been made included channel lining and utilization of closed pipes in order to improve efficiency in conveyance infrastructure, the use of water measuring techniques to encourage improved management, and the use of overnight storage facilities. Approximately 9% (about 25,000 ha) of the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>cultivation</b> are irrigated, and about 9,000 ha require rehabilitation.|$|E
50|$|The Cariri {{climbing}} mouse, Rhipidomys cariri, is a partly arboreal rodent {{species from}} South America.

25|$|Agriculture {{was not a}} {{profitable}} business for Bermudians in any case. The land <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>cultivation</b> was so small (especially by comparison to the plots granted settlers in Virginia), that fields could {{not be allowed to}} lie fallow, and farmers attempted to produce three crops each year. Islanders quickly turned to shipbuilding and maritime trades, but the Company, which gained its profits only from the land under cultivation, forbade the construction of any vessels without its license. Its interference in Bermudians livelihood would lead to its dissolution in 1684.|$|E
25|$|Low {{rainfall}} made farming difficult {{until the}} introduction of irrigation. Currently, the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>cultivation</b> is quite low, ranging from 60% in Maharastra to about 10% in Western Ghats. Except in developed areas of certain river valleys, double-cropping is rare. Rice is the predominant crop in high-rainfall areas and sorghum in low-rainfall areas. Other crops of significance include cotton, tobacco, oilseeds, and sugar cane. Coffee, tea, coconuts, areca, pepper, rubber, cashew nuts, tapioca, and cardamom are widely grown on plantations in the Nilgiri Hills and on the western slopes of the Western Ghats. Cultivation of Jatropha has recently received more attention due to the Jatropha incentives in India.|$|E
25|$|However, such {{intensive}} agriculture {{in such an}} arid area has had a significant negative impact of water supplies. Eighty-eight percent of all water taken from {{above and below the}} surface is used for agriculture. One third of aquifers are overdrafted, especially in Caborca, Guaymas and the coast near Hermosillo. There have been water disputes in the state, notablely between officials from Hermosillo and the relatively water-rich Ciudad Obregón. The overpumping has drastically lowered water tables and has increased soil salinity in many areas. In some areas, the tables have dropped by as much as one or two meters per year, making fresh water increasing unavailable and forcing the abandonment of croplands. For this reason, {{in the last quarter of}} the 20th century <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>cultivation</b> in Sonora dropped by more than 24%.|$|E
50|$|The hooded red-sided opossum (Monodelphis palliolata) is a South American opossum {{species of}} the family Didelphidae. Until recently, it {{was viewed as a}} {{subspecies}} of M. brevicaudata.

500|$|From the {{commencement}} of the Bronze Age to about 2000 BC the archaeological record shows {{a decline in the}} number of large new stone buildings constructed. Pollen analyses suggest that at this time woodland increased at the expense of the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>cultivation.</b> In Orkney, burials were now being made in small cists well away from the great megalithic sites and a new Beaker culture began to dominate. Bronze and Iron Age metalworking was slowly introduced to Scotland from Europe over a lengthy period. (By contrast, the Neolithic monumental culture spread south from northern Scotland into England.) As the Bronze Age developed, Scotland's population grew to perhaps 300,000 in the second millennium BC. [...] There were evidently significant differences between the lifestyles of Bronze Age peoples inhabiting Scotland. For example, finds at the Traprain Law site (near modern Edinburgh) suggest that the priests there may have overseen ceremonies on a par with their contemporaries on mainland Europe. On the other hand, although the mummifications found at Cladh Hallan in the Western Isles invite comparisons with Egypt, the simple lifestyle of the inhabitants of this settlement contrasts with that of Tutankamun – even if the former's lives may have been preferable to those of the toiling slaves who built Amarna at this time.|$|E

2500|$|Increases in {{urbanization}} {{and in the}} <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>cultivation</b> during Roman rule caused wholesale dislocations of the Berber society, forcing nomad {{tribes to}} settle or to move from their traditional rangelands.

The Roman emperor Trajan established a frontier in the south by encircling the Aurès and Nemencha mountains and building a line of forts from Vescera (modern Biskra) to Ad Majores (Hennchir Besseriani, southeast of Biskra). The defensive line extended {{at least as far}} as Castellum Dimmidi (modern Messaâd, southwest of Biskra), Roman Algeria's southernmost fort.
