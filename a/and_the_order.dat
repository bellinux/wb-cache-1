5|$|All of the Peano axioms {{except the}} ninth axiom (the {{induction}} axiom) are statements in first-order logic. The arithmetical operations of addition and multiplication <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> relation {{can also be}} defined using first-order axioms. The axiom of induction is in second-order, since it quantifies over predicates (equivalently, sets of natural numbers rather than natural numbers), {{but it can be}} transformed into a first-order axiom schema of induction. Such a schema includes one axiom per predicate definable in the first-order language of Peano arithmetic, making it weaker than the second-order axiom.|$|E
