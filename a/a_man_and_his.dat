5|$|Although written {{during the}} Twelfth dynasty, Ipuwer only survives from a Nineteenth dynasty papyrus. However, <b>A</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> Ba is found on an {{original}} Twelfth dynasty papyrus, Papyrus Berlin 3024. These two texts resemble other discourses in style, tone, and subject matter, {{although they are}} unique in that the fictional audiences are given very active roles in the exchange of dialogue. In Ipuwer, a sage addresses an unnamed king and his attendants, describing the miserable state of the land, which he blames on the king's inability to uphold royal virtues. This can be seen either {{as a warning to}} kings or as a legitimization of the current dynasty, contrasting it with the supposedly turbulent period that preceded it. In <b>A</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> Ba, a man recounts for an audience a conversation with his ba (a component of the Egyptian soul) on whether to continue living in despair or to seek death as an escape from misery.|$|E

5|$|De Stem des Bloeds (The Voice of Blood), {{also known}} as Njai Siti, is a 1930 film from the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). It was {{directed}} by Ph. Carli and starred Annie Krohn, Sylvain Boekebinder, Vally Lank, and Jan Kruyt. The film follows <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> mistress who reunite after their son and step-daughter unwittingly fall in love. The black-and-white film, which may now be lost, was tinted different colours for certain scenes. It was released in early 1930 to commercial success, although critical opinion was mixed.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the caves}} around Adams {{were subject to}} {{commercial}} ventures. In the 1860s, ice was gathered from the Ice Cave and shipped to Portland and The Dalles in years of short supply elsewhere. Oddly, a “claim” to the cave using mining laws was used {{in order to gain}} exclusive access to the ice. Cheese Cave was used for potato storage in the 1930s and later was home to the Guler Cheese Company, which produced, {{for a number of years}} in the 1950s, a bleu cheese similar to the Roquefort produced in Roquefort-sur-Soulzon, France. A legend from the Klickitats regarding the formation of the caves, involves <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> wife who were of gigantic stature. The man left his wife and married a mouse, which became a woman. His wife was furious and because she threatened to kill the man and the “mouse-wife,” they hid farther up the mountain at a lake. The man’s wife assumed they were underground and began digging for them. In the process, she dug out the many caves in the area. Eventually, she reached the place where they were and the man allowed her to kill the “mouse-wife” to save his own life. Her blood colored the rocks of the lake red and the place was known as Hool-hool-se, which is from the Native American word for mouse. Eventually, the wife killed the man as well and lived alone in the mountains.|$|E
