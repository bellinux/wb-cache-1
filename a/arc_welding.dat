5|$|Shielded metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> (SMAW), {{also known}} as manual metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> (MMA or MMAW), flux {{shielded}} <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> or informally as stick welding, is a manual <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> process that uses a consumable electrode covered with a flux to lay the weld.|$|E
5|$|During {{the middle}} of the century, many new welding methods were invented. In 1930, Kyle Taylor was {{responsible}} for the release of stud welding, which soon became popular in shipbuilding and construction. Submerged <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> was invented the same year and continues to be popular today. In 1932 a Russian, Konstantin Khrenov successfully implemented the first underwater electric <b>arc</b> <b>welding.</b> Gas tungsten <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> after decades of development, was finally perfected in 1941, and gas metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> followed in 1948, allowing for fast welding of non-ferrous materials but requiring expensive shielding gases. Shielded metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> was developed during the 1950s, using a flux-coated consumable electrode, and it quickly became the most popular metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> process. In 1957, the flux-cored <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> process debuted, in which the self-shielded wire electrode could be used with automatic equipment, resulting in greatly increased welding speeds, and that same year, plasma <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> was invented. Electroslag welding was introduced in 1958, and it was followed by its cousin, electrogas welding, in 1961. In 1953, the Soviet scientist N. F. Kazakov proposed the diffusion bonding method.|$|E

5|$|Submerged <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> (SAW) is a {{high-productivity}} {{welding method}} {{in which the}} arc is struck beneath a covering layer of flux. This increases arc quality, since contaminants in the atmosphere are blocked by the flux. The slag that forms on the weld generally comes off by itself, and combined {{with the use of}} a continuous wire feed, the weld deposition rate is high. Working conditions are much improved over other <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> processes, since the flux hides the arc and almost no smoke is produced. The process is commonly used in industry, especially for large products and in the manufacture of welded pressure vessels. Other <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> processes include atomic hydrogen welding, electroslag welding, electrogas welding, and stud <b>arc</b> <b>welding.</b>|$|E
5|$|To {{supply the}} {{electrical}} power necessary for <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> processes, {{a variety of}} different power supplies can be used. The most common welding power supplies are constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> the length of the arc {{is directly related to the}} voltage, and the amount of heat input is related to the current. Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> and shielded metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> flux cored <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> and submerged <b>arc</b> <b>welding.</b> In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.|$|E
5|$|GMAW {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular welding methods, {{especially}} in industrial environments. It is used extensively by the sheet metal industry and, by extension, the automobile industry. There, the method is often used for arc spot welding, thereby replacing riveting or resistance spot welding. It is also popular for automated welding, in which robots handle the workpieces and the welding gun to speed up the manufacturing process. GMAW can be difficult to perform well outdoors, since drafts can dissipate the shielding gas and allow contaminants into the weld; flux cored <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> is better suited for outdoor use such as in construction. Likewise, GMAW's use of a shielding gas does not lend itself to underwater welding, which is more commonly performed via shielded metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> flux cored <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> or gas tungsten <b>arc</b> <b>welding.</b>|$|E

5|$|GTAW is most {{commonly}} used to weld thin sections of stainless steel and non-ferrous metals such as aluminum, magnesium, and copper alloys. The process grants the operator greater control over the weld than competing processes such as shielded metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> and gas metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> allowing for stronger, higher quality welds. However, GTAW is comparatively more complex and difficult to master, and furthermore, it is significantly slower than most other welding techniques. A related process, plasma <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> uses a slightly different welding torch {{to create a more}} focused welding arc and as a result is often automated.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> is {{most commonly}} used to weld stainless steel and nonferrous materials, such as aluminum and magnesium, {{but it can be}} applied to nearly all metals, with a notable exception being zinc and its alloys. Its applications involving carbon steels are limited not because of process restrictions, but because of the existence of more economical steel welding techniques, such as gas metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> and shielded metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding.</b> Furthermore, GTAW can be performed in a variety of other-than-flat positions, depending on the skill of the welder and the materials being welded.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} common types of <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> is {{shielded}} metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> (SMAW); it is also known as manual metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> (MMA) or stick welding. Electric current is used to strike an arc between the base material and consumable electrode rod, which is made of filler material (typically steel) and is covered with a flux that protects the weld area from oxidation and contamination by producing carbon dioxide (CO2) gas during the welding process. The electrode core itself acts as filler material, making a separate filler unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Shielded metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> {{is one of}} the world's {{most popular}} welding processes, {{accounting}} for over half of all welding in some countries. Because of its versatility and simplicity, it is particularly dominant in the maintenance and repair industry, and is heavily used in the construction of steel structures and in industrial fabrication. In recent years its use has declined as flux-cored <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> has expanded in the construction industry and gas metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> has become more popular in industrial environments. However, because of the low equipment cost and wide applicability, the process will likely remain popular, especially among amateurs and small businesses where specialized welding processes are uneconomical and unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|While many welding {{applications}} {{are done in}} controlled environments such as factories and repair shops, some welding processes are commonly used {{in a wide variety}} of conditions, such as open air, underwater, and vacuums (such as space). In open-air applications, such as construction and outdoors repair, shielded metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> is the most common process. Processes that employ inert gases to protect the weld cannot be readily used in such situations, because unpredictable atmospheric movements can result in a faulty weld. Shielded metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> is also often used in underwater welding in the construction and repair of ships, offshore platforms, and pipelines, but others, such as flux cored <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> and gas tungsten <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> are also common. Welding in space is also possible—it was first attempted in 1969 by Russian cosmonauts, when they performed experiments to test shielded metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> plasma <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> and electron beam welding in a depressurized environment. Further testing of these methods was done in the following decades, and today researchers continue to develop methods for using other welding processes in space, such as laser beam welding, resistance welding, and friction welding. Advances in these areas may be useful for future endeavours similar to the construction of the International Space Station, which could rely on welding for joining in space the parts that were manufactured on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Shielding gases are {{necessary}} for gas metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they {{come in contact with}} the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. This problem is common to all <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> processes; for example, in the older Shielded-Metal <b>Arc</b> <b>Welding</b> process (SMAW), the electrode is coated with a solid flux which evolves a protective cloud of carbon dioxide when melted by the arc. In GMAW, however, the electrode wire does not have a flux coating, and a separate shielding gas is employed to protect the weld. This eliminates slag, the hard residue from the flux that builds up after welding and must be chipped off to reveal the completed weld.|$|E
5|$|The type {{of current}} used plays an {{important}} role in <b>arc</b> <b>welding.</b> Consumable electrode processes such as shielded metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> and gas metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> generally use direct current, but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively. In welding, the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration, and as a result, changing the polarity of the electrode affects weld properties. If the electrode is positively charged, the base metal will be hotter, increasing weld penetration and welding speed. Alternatively, a negatively charged electrode results in more shallow welds. Nonconsumable electrode processes, such as gas tungsten <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> can use either type of direct current, as well as alternating current. However, with direct current, because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a positively charged electrode causes shallow welds, while a negatively charged electrode makes deeper welds. Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration welds. One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every zero crossing, has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal sine wave, making rapid zero crossings possible and minimizing the effects of the problem.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{versatility}} of {{the process}} and the simplicity of its equipment and operation, shielded metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> is one of the world's first and most popular welding processes. It dominates other welding processes in the maintenance and repair industry, and though flux-cored <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> is growing in popularity, SMAW continues to be used extensively in the construction of heavy steel structures and in industrial fabrication. The process is used primarily to weld iron and steels (including stainless steel) but aluminium, nickel and copper alloys can also be welded with this method.|$|E
