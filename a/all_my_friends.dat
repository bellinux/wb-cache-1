5|$|Nobody {{has ever}} cut {{anything}} from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In {{the first version}} the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second — 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. I am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes of brutality in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, {{as opposed to a}} mere unpleasant impression which would only destroy our intent. <b>All</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> and colleagues who during long discussions were advising me to make those cuts turned out right in the end. It took me some time to understand it. At first I got the impression they were attempting to pressure my creative individuality. Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for it. And I do not regret at all that the film has been shortened to its present length.|$|E

500|$|Nutting {{ordered an}} initial {{production}} run of 1,500 units of Computer Space, an optimistic decision given that a hit arcade {{game at the}} time would sell around 2,000 units, though a handful had reached 10,000. Reception to the game from distributors was mixed; while some were excited by the game, others felt it to be confusing {{and part of a}} passing video game fad. By spring 1972 the game had sold over 1,000 units, and according to Bushnell in 1976 ended up selling between 1,300 and 1,500 units. While this was a commercial success, making over US$1,000,000, it was a disappointment to Nutting, who had been hoping for a large-scale success like Computer Quiz. The game's relative lack of success was attributed to the complexity of its controls and a steep learning curve, which pushed away customers used to less complex games. Bushnell noted that the locations that the game did well in, like the Dutch Goose playtest location, were generally located near university campuses; the general market for coin-operated games, however, was in working-class bars, where the patrons were less interested in deciphering a complicated game. In the documentary Video Game Invasion: The History of a Global Obsession, Bushnell explained, [...] "Sure, I loved it, and <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> loved it, but <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> were engineers. It was a little too complicated for the guy with the beer in the bar." [...] Bushnell has also stated that part of the difficulty lay in the novelty of the game; he has said that even a few years later the controls and gameplay would have been more understandable to players who would have seen other video games by then. Conversely, Bushnell and Dabney have said that the game's novelty was also part of its appeal to players—most people had never seen a television screen displaying images being controlled by a person in front of it, rather than playing video from a remote television station.|$|E
500|$|Björk {{chose the}} title Post for two reasons. Firstly, {{it refers to}} the fact that all the songs on the album were written after her move to England, while the songs on Debut were songs she had written during the {{previous}} ten years of her life in Iceland. In a 1996 interview, Björk said: [...] "I always knew it would be two albums and that's why I called them Debut and Post. Before and after". Secondly, the title was inspired by the singer's desire to communicate with friends and family back in Iceland, giving Post the additional meaning of [...] "mail". Talking with Raw in 1996, Björk stated: [...] "I called the record Post, because I always address my songs back in my head to Iceland in a letter. Because it was such a big jump for me to move away from all my relatives, <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends,</b> everything I know".|$|E

So it's a dream come true. Never did I ever think that I'd be in the mix with Britney. I'm just lucky." [...] When asked about how she learned about Sabi {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone, Spears revealed, [...] "friends and people around me are always showing me new artists that they love and that's how I learned about Sabi and ended up working with her on '(Drop Dead) Beautiful'. I have always wanted to feature a new artist on one of my albums and she is really cool." [...] A small teaser of the song was unveiled by the singer on March 7, 2011. Four days later, it leaked in full online, along with another Femme Fatale track, [...] "Inside Out". On August 5, 2011, Spears posted a poll on her Facebook page asking fans whether her next single should be [...] "Criminal", [...] "Inside Out" [...] or [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful."

2500|$|By {{the age of}} 10, Theile {{was enjoying}} success at local {{swimming}} carnivals, so his father offered to arrange {{for him to be}} coached, but left Theile with the choice of coaches. Of the two coaches in the town, Theile chose Arthur Cusack, who had a reputation as a physical training instructor of whom Theile recounted as being [...] "tough and enthusiastic. <b>All</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> avoided him....somehow I sensed that it was an important decision." [...] Cusack turned out to be his lifelong coach. Under the guidance of Cusack, Maryborough Swimming Club challenged the metropolitan clubs in Brisbane for statewide supremacy. Theile won Queensland junior and open titles in all four strokes. In 1954, at the age of 16, he came second in the open backstroke, and after becoming the national junior champion that year, he decided to concentrate on the given stroke. In 1955, he captured the 110yd backstroke title at the Australian Championships in Adelaide. At the same time, Theile completed his secondary education and was awarded an academic scholarship to study medicine at the University of Queensland.|$|E

2500|$|Loyalties to the {{two teams}} divided friends, families, and co-workers, and shaped the locals in various ways, as George Will noted in a 1998 {{commencement}} address at Washington University in St. Louis: [...] "I grew up in Champaign, Illinois, midway between Chicago and St. Louis. At an age too tender for life-shaping decisions, I made one. While <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> were becoming Cardinals fans, I became a Cub fan. My friends, happily rooting for Stan Musial, Red Schoendienst, and other great Redbirds, grew up cheerfully convinced {{that the world is}} a benign place, so of course, they became liberals. Rooting for the Cubs in the late 1940s and early 1950s, I became gloomy, pessimistic, morose, dyspeptic and conservative. It helped out of course that the Cubs last won the World Series in 1908, which is two years before Mark Twain and Tolstoy died. But that means, class of 1998, that the Cubs are in the 89th year of their rebuilding effort, and remember, any team can have a bad moment." ...|$|E

His memory connect him to his ideals {{as well as his}} individuality, his creativity, his natural life, even if it leaves him [...] "appallingly out of sync with the times", in which the trend was to speak of {{sweeping}} away the entire social system, taking a nuanced view, [...] "preserving the old things", as well as [...] "protecting the new", yet still condemning the worst of the new – skyscrapers and office blocks – as well as the old.
