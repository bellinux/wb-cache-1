5|$|Grønlandsfly also {{purchased}} {{its first}} jet aircraft, a Boeing 757–200 which began operation in May 1998. The <b>airliner</b> was named Kunuunnguaq {{in honour of}} the Greenlandic explorer and ethnologist Knud Rasmussen, whose bust decorates in the terminal of Kangerlussuaq hub. The <b>airliner</b> allowed the company to run the profitable Kangerlussuaq–Copenhagen route directly, without affiliates or a layover in Iceland. Thus, in 1999, the airline served 282,000 passengers, nearly triple the number {{at the end of}} the previous decade.|$|E
5|$|The Avro Type 722 Atlantic was a 1952 {{proposal}} (announced in June 1953) for a 120-passenger delta-winged <b>airliner</b> {{based on}} the Type 698.|$|E
5|$|The Boeing 767 is a mid- to large-size, mid- to long-range, {{wide-body}} twin-engine jet <b>airliner</b> {{built by}} Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It was Boeing's first wide-body twinjet and its first <b>airliner</b> with a two-crew glass cockpit. The aircraft has two turbofan engines, a conventional tail, and, for reduced aerodynamic drag, a supercritical wing design. Designed as a smaller wide-body <b>airliner</b> than earlier aircraft {{such as the}} 747, the 767 has seating capacity for 181 to 375 people, and a design range of , depending on variant. Development of the 767 occurred in tandem with a narrow-body twinjet, the 757, resulting in shared design features which allow pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate both aircraft.|$|E
50|$|A great {{majority}} of the global market for middle-sized and large-sized <b>airliners</b> is divided between Airbus and Boeing, although Russian/former Soviet manufacturers still sell significant numbers of <b>airliners</b> to their traditional markets. The market for smaller-sized <b>airliners</b> is mostly split between ATR, Embraer and Bombardier.|$|R
50|$|A smaller, {{more common}} class of <b>airliners</b> is the narrow-body or single aisle aircraft. These smaller <b>airliners</b> are {{generally}} used for medium haul flights with fewer passengers than their wide-body counterparts. Currently produced narrow-body <b>airliners</b> are the Boeing 737, Airbus A320 family, Bombardier CSeries or Tupolev Tu-204/214.|$|R
50|$|Propeller-driven <b>airliners</b> had {{useful load}} {{fractions}} {{on the order}} of 25-35%. Modern jet <b>airliners</b> have considerably higher useful load fractions, {{on the order of}} 45-55%.|$|R
5|$|By April 2014, with {{cumulative}} sales surpassing {{those of}} the 747, the 777 became the best-selling wide-body airliner; at existing production rates, the aircraft was on track to become the most-delivered wide-body <b>airliner</b> by mid-2016.|$|E
5|$|Korean Air Lines Flight 007 (also {{known as}} KAL007 and KE007) was a {{scheduled}} Korean Air Lines flight from New York City to Seoul via Anchorage, Alaska. On September 1, 1983, the South Korean <b>airliner</b> serving {{the flight was}} shot down by a Soviet Su-15 interceptor. The Boeing 747 <b>airliner</b> was en route from Anchorage to Seoul, but deviated from its original planned route and flew through Soviet prohibited airspace {{around the time of}} a U.S. aerial reconnaissance mission. The Soviet Air Force treated the unidentified aircraft as an intruding U.S. spy plane, and proceeded to destroy it with air-to-air missiles, after firing warning shots which were likely not seen by the KAL pilots. The Korean <b>airliner</b> eventually crashed in the sea near Moneron Island west of Sakhalin in the Sea of Japan. All 269 passengers and crew aboard were killed, including Larry McDonald, a Representative from Georgia in the United States House of Representatives. The Soviets found the wreckage under the sea on September 15, and found the flight recorders in October, but this information was kept secret until 1993.|$|E
5|$|On 19 December 1946 a Railway Air Services Dakota 3 <b>airliner</b> taking-off from Northolt {{crashed into}} a house in Angus Drive, Ruislip, {{fortunately}} with no serous injuries to anyone, either in the aircraft or on the ground.|$|E
50|$|A smaller, {{more common}} class of <b>airliners</b> is the narrow-body or single aisle aircraft. These smaller <b>airliners</b> are {{generally}} used for short to medium-distance flights with fewer passengers than their wide-body counterparts.|$|R
50|$|Today's {{turboprop}} <b>airliners</b> {{have better}} fuel efficiency than current jet <b>airliners,</b> {{in part because}} of their lower cruising speed and propellers that are more efficient than those of the 1950s-era piston-powered airlines.|$|R
50|$|With the {{airlines}} set to re-equip with the then-new jet <b>airliners,</b> Cessna management identified that surplus propeller-driven <b>airliners</b> would soon flood the used aircraft market, driving prices down. A cost {{analysis indicated that}} the model 620 would be smaller and cost more than the surplus <b>airliners</b> and thus was not economically viable. The project was cancelled in October 1957, one aircraft having been completed. The airplane was eventually sold for scrap.|$|R
5|$|Production {{aircraft}} for Cubana de Aviación, four built. Delivery {{taking place}} on 15 December 1958, later one leased to Cunard Eagle in 1960–1961 and this same <b>airliner</b> leased to CSA in 1962.|$|E
5|$|The A320 was {{the first}} civil <b>airliner</b> to include a full digital {{fly-by-wire}} flight control system. At {{the time of the}} aircraft's introduction, the behaviour of the fly-by-wire system equipped with full flight envelope protection was a new experience for many pilots.|$|E
5|$|The {{eruption}} {{also caused}} an <b>airliner</b> {{to have all}} four engines fail after a Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet operated by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines flew into a cloud of volcanic ash.|$|E
50|$|Modern jet {{aircraft}} have twice the fuel {{efficiency of the}} earliest jet <b>airliners.</b> Late 1950s piston <b>airliners</b> like the Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation and DC-7 were 1% to 28% more energy intensive than 1990s jet <b>airliners</b> which cruise 40 to 80% faster. The early jet <b>airliners</b> were designed {{at a time when}} air crew labor costs were higher relative to fuel costs than today. Despite the high fuel consumption, because fuel was inexpensive in that era the higher speed resulted in favorable economical returns since crew costs and amortization of capital investment in the aircraft could be spread over more seat miles flown per day.|$|R
50|$|Hydromash JSC {{then became}} {{involved}} in various international projects, such as Embraer regional jets, Airbus A320 family <b>airliners,</b> Airbus A330 and Airbus A340 long-haul <b>airliners,</b> {{as well as the}} Bombardier Global Express business jet and AgustaWestland AW139 helicopter.|$|R
5000|$|Deicing {{boots are}} most {{commonly}} seen on medium-sized <b>airliners</b> and utility aircraft. Larger <b>airliners</b> and military jets {{tend to use}} heating systems within the wing, keeping it constantly warm and preventing ice from forming. Sources of heat include: ...|$|R
5|$|The final {{scenes in}} the film, shot at Buchanan Field, feature a Douglas DC-7C <b>airliner</b> of Magic Carpet Airlines which had {{previously}} been leased from owner Club America Incorporated by the rock band Grand Funk Railroad from March 1971 to June 1971.|$|E
5|$|United Airlines first {{placed the}} 767 in {{commercial}} service in 1982. The aircraft was initially flown on domestic and transcontinental routes, during which it demonstrated {{the reliability of}} its twinjet design. In 1985, the 767 became the first twin-engined <b>airliner</b> to receive regulatory approval for extended overseas flights. The aircraft was then used to expand non-stop service on medium- to long-haul intercontinental routes. In 1986, Boeing initiated studies for a higher-capacity 767, ultimately leading {{to the development of}} the 777, a larger wide-body twinjet. In the 1990s, the 767 became the most frequently used <b>airliner</b> for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe.|$|E
5|$|Aboard the <b>airliner</b> FBI agents {{recovered}} 66 unidentified latent fingerprints, Cooper's black clip-on tie and mother-of-pearl tie clip, {{and two of}} {{the four}} parachutes, one of which had been opened and two shroud lines cut from its canopy. Eyewitnesses in Portland, Seattle, and Reno, and all those who personally interacted with Cooper were interviewed. A series of composite sketches was developed.|$|E
5000|$|Having {{previously}} operated smaller aircraft types, Schreiner Aerocontractors NV acquired two Douglas DC-3 twin engined 28-seat <b>airliners</b> in 1963 {{and operated}} them on intra-European passenger and freight charter flights. The aircraft were disposed of in 1967. [...] Between April 1964 and December 1967 {{a total of}} six owned and leased Fokker Friendship twin-engined turboprop <b>airliners</b> were flown on European passenger flights. Three Douglas DC-7C long range <b>airliners</b> were operated on intercontinental charter flights between July 1965 and June 1968.|$|R
50|$|Later 727 {{models were}} {{stretched}} to carry more passengers and replaced earlier jet <b>airliners</b> {{such as the}} Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, as well as aging propeller <b>airliners</b> such as the DC-4, DC-6, DC-7, and the Lockheed Constellations on short- and medium-haul routes.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{the airport}} had no {{perimeter}} rule; from 1954 to 1960, airlines scheduled nonstop flights to California on piston-engine <b>airliners.</b> Scheduled jet <b>airliners</b> {{were not allowed}} at all until April 1966; the perimeter rule arrived with them, and apparently applied only to them.|$|R
5|$|An off-duty Northwest Airlines {{pilot who}} {{observed}} the crash told newspapers {{that he believed}} that the <b>airliner</b> had been struck by lightning. Some local farmers said that the plane seemed to barrel roll, but also observed that while rainfall was significant, winds were relatively light.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the accident, the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 was the only tri-jet <b>airliner</b> in production. The MD-11 was {{produced}} as a freighter then; the last passenger version was delivered to Sabena in 1998. The last MD-11 overall was delivered to Lufthansa Cargo in 2001, as a freighter.|$|E
5|$|Bond is {{eventually}} captured by Gorner in the heroin plant, who explains that Bond {{is to be}} used as bait during a drugs delivery across the Afghan desert, and should he survive an expected ambush, is to fly the captured <b>airliner</b> into the Russian heartland. Bond would be identified as British upon its destruction, increasing the evidence against the British Government. Bond survives the predicted Afghan attack and plots an escape attempt, which sees Scarlett get away due to Bond surrendering himself as a diversion. In the morning he is taken aboard the aeroplane. Before the <b>airliner</b> can bomb the Soviets, with the aid of the airliner's pilot and Scarlett (who had been hiding on board), Bond regains control of the aeroplane and crashes it into a mountainside after parachuting to safety.|$|E
5000|$|In 1961, {{service to}} Miami was {{originated}} with four-engined Douglas DC-6 <b>airliners.</b> The airline later operated the Douglas DC-6B version as well. Convair 340/440 twin-engined medium <b>airliners</b> were also acquired to replace {{some of the}} DC-3s on short-haul routes in Latin America.|$|R
50|$|G.212CP:The first {{production}} series civil <b>airliners.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Originally, {{the airport}} had no {{perimeter}} rule. From 1954 to 1960, airlines operated nonstop flights to California on piston-engine <b>airliners.</b> Scheduled jet <b>airliners</b> {{were not allowed}} until April 1966, and concerns about aviation noise led to noise restrictions even before jet service began in 1966.|$|R
5|$|Garrett Brock Trapnell hijacked a TWA <b>airliner</b> {{en route}} from Los Angeles to New York City in January. He demanded $306,800 in cash, the release of Angela Davis, and an {{audience}} with President Richard Nixon. After the aircraft landed at Kennedy Airport, he was shot and wounded by FBI agents, then arrested.|$|E
5|$|On January4, 1973, a Pacific Western Airlines Convair {{turboprop}} <b>airliner</b> {{preparing to}} take off from Vancouver, British Columbia, for a flight to Penticton with 18 people on board was hijacked by 26-year-old passenger Christopher Kenneth Nielson, who drew a gun and demanded $2 {{million in cash and}} to be flown to North Vietnam, threatening to blow up the <b>airliner</b> if his demands were not met. During negotiations at Vancouver International Airport, Nielson allowed the other 13 passengers and one crew member to disembark, leaving three crew members aboard the plane with him. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) then stormed the plane and arrested Nielson, finding that he was armed only with two toy guns. There were no fatalities in the incident.|$|E
5|$|On October 16, 2017, Airbus {{announced}} {{a partnership with}} Bombardier Aerospace, taking over a majority share of the Bombardier CSeries <b>airliner</b> program. As {{a result of this}} partnership, Airbus plans to open an assembly line for CSeries aircraft in Mobile, particularly to serve the US market. This effort may allow the companies to circumvent high import tariffs on the CSeries family.|$|E
50|$|With the Boeing 777 model <b>airliners,</b> the two pilots can {{completely}} {{override the}} computerized flight-control system {{to permit the}} aircraft to be flown beyond its usual flight-control envelope during emergencies.
