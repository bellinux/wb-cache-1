40|$|The {{present study}} shows that inhibition-of-return reduces {{competition}} for selection within the oculomotor system. We examined the e#ect of a distractor when it was presented <b>at</b> <b>an</b> inhibited <b>location</b> (IOR). The results show that due to IOR distractors cause less interference. This was evident in all three measures. First, there was less oculomotor capture when a distractor was presented <b>at</b> <b>an</b> inhibited <b>location.</b> Second, the saccade latency to the target was shorter when <b>a</b> distractor appeared <b>at</b> <b>an</b> inhibited <b>location</b> than when it appeared <b>at</b> <b>a</b> non-inhibited <b>location.</b> Third, there was less curvature towards the distractor when it was presented at inhibited <b>location</b> relative to <b>a</b> non-inhibited <b>location.</b> The observation that there is less interference for <b>a</b> distractor presented <b>at</b> <b>an</b> inhibited <b>location</b> suggests that IOR reduces the exogenous activation of the distractor within the saccade map...|$|R

5|$|Holland {{suggests}} {{that under the}} reign of Arab Emperor Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, even though {{only a small percentage}} of the inhabitants of the Empire was Muslim, Mecca was intentionally yet erroneously portrayed as Muhammad's home and the birthplace of Islam in order to provide the religion with Arabian origins.

5|$|Across {{the county}} line, US31 {{continues}} eastward, passing {{north of the}} community of Interlochen. At Interlochen Corners, it intersects M-137. The highway then angles northeasterly north of Duck Lake and south of Silver Lake. A few miles farther east, US31 meets M-37 <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>location</b> known as Chums Corners. The two highways join and run northward through the unincorporated community. It passes Wuerfel Park, the home stadium for the Traverse City Beach Bums, a minor-league baseball team. From there, US31/M-37 runs downhill into Garfield Township. In this area, the highway passes through a cluster of retail stores and car dealerships near the Grand Traverse Mall. North of the intersection with 14th Street, the trunkline follows Division Street into Traverse City. From there it runs to the east of Grand Traverse Commons, the former Traverse City State Hospital, before US31/M-37 meets Grandview Parkway next to the West Arm of the Grand Traverse Bay.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} failed {{attempts}} to extract {{oil from the}} salt domes near Beaumont, a small enterprise known as the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company was joined in 1899 by Croatian/Austrian mechanical engineer Anthony F. Lucas, an expert in salt domes. Lucas joined the company {{in response to the}} numerous ads the company's founder Pattillo Higgins placed in industrial magazines and trade journals. Lucas and his colleagues struggled for two years to find oil <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>location</b> known as Spindletop Hill before making a strike in 1901. The new well produced approximately 100,000 barrels of oil per day, an unprecedented level of production at the time. The 1902 total annual production at Spindletop exceeded 17 million barrels. The state's total production in 1900 had been only 836,000 barrels. The overabundance of supply led oil prices in the U.S. to drop to a record low of 3 cents per barrel, less than the price of water in some areas.|$|E
5|$|Coalhouse Fort is an {{artillery}} fort {{built in the}} 1860s to guard the lower Thames from seaborne attack. It stands at Coalhouse Point in Essex on the north bank of the river, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>location</b> near East Tilbury that was vulnerable to raiders and invaders. It was the last {{in a series of}} fortifications dating back to the 15th century and was the direct successor to a smaller mid-19th century fort built on the same site. Constructed during a period of tension with France, its location on marshy ground caused problems from the start and led to a lengthy construction process. The fort was equipped with a variety of large-calibre artillery guns and the most modern defensive facilities at the time, including shell-proof casemates protected by granite facing and cast-iron shields. However, its lengthy construction and the rapid pace of artillery development at the time meant that it was virtually obsolete for its original purpose within a few years of its completion.|$|E

The driver is required to retain a copy of each log page for the previous seven consecutive days which must be in his/her possession and available for inspection while on-duty.|$|E
5|$|Freyr arrives {{home and}} neither sleeps nor drinks, {{remaining}} in silence. No one dares speak to him. The god NjÃ¶rÃ°r sends Freyr's servant SkÃ­rnir {{to speak to}} Freyr. Freyr tells SkÃ­rnir that he saw a beautiful woman, so beautiful that he was filled with grief {{and that he would}} soon die if he could not have her. Freyr tells SkÃ­rnir that he must go gain her hand on his behalfâ€”whether the woman's father agrees or notâ€”and he will be rewarded. SkÃ­rnir replies that he accepts the mission but only in exchange for Freyr's sword, which can fight on its own. Freyr gives him the sword and SkÃ­rnir sets off. SkÃ­rnir asks for the woman's hand for Freyr and receives her promise. Nine nights later she is to meet with Freyr <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>location</b> called Barey. SkÃ­rnir delivers the news to Freyr and Freyr responds with the final stanza from the Poetic Edda poem SkÃ­rnismÃ¡l, lamenting that he must wait.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus' {{divisions}} met {{up to the}} north, and ravaged {{the countryside}} between the Ems and the Lippe, and penetrated to the Teutoburg Forest, a mountain forest in Western Germany situated between these two rivers. There, Germanicus {{and some of his}} men visited the site of the disastrous Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, and began burying the remains of the Roman soldiers that had been left in the open. After half a day of the work, he called off the burial of bones so that they could continue their war against the Germans. He made his way into the heartland of the Cherusci. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>location</b> Tacitus calls the pontes longi ("long causeways"), in boggy lowlands somewhere near the Ems, Arminius' troops attacked the Romans. Arminius initially caught Germanicus' cavalry in a trap, inflicting minor casualties, but the Roman infantry reinforced the rout and checked them. The fighting lasted for two days, with neither side achieving a decisive victory. Germanicus' forces withdrew and returned to the Rhine.|$|E

5|$|In Virginia, {{the storm}} {{produced}} a storm tide of 3.6feet (1.1m) above normal in Norfolk. Sustained winds peaked at 60mph (95km/h) in Langley Air Force Base, while gusts reached 71mph (114km/h) in Norfolk. The bands {{of the storm}} spawned an F1 tornado near Portsmouth and Chesapeake, damaging twelve homes and downing hundreds of trees. Damage from the tornado amounted to $250,000 (1971USD, $ USD). Rainfall from Doria was moderate, peaking at 6.44inches (164mm) <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>location</b> 2miles (3.2km) south-southeast of Halifax. One person drowned in Alexandria when she fell into a draining ditch. The storm severely damaged a large warehouse in Norfolk, as well. Damage in Virginia totaled $375,000 (1971USD, $ USD). Floodwaters from Doria clogged sewage systems near Norfolk, Virginia with sand and silt. This forced the sewage to be dumped into the Chesapeake Bay, resulting in the closure of several beaches for days.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to recruiting in battle, new demons are acquired through fusion <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>location</b> called the Cathedral of Shadows. Normally only two demons can be fused at once, but {{under certain conditions}} more demons can be fused together. Fusions can produce a variety of results based on various circumstances, such as the current phase of Kagutsuchi {{and the addition of}} items called Deathstones. When in the Cathedral of Shadows, the Protagonist can select two demons, viewing a preview of the resultant demon, then initiate a fusion. The resultant demon will both possess its own skills and inherit skills from its two parents: skill inheritance is randomized. Higher-level demons produce more powerful fusions. Demons gained through negotiation or fusion are automatically stored in the Demon Compendium, a record kept within the Cathedral of Shadows. The Protagonist can also pay to summon a demon from the Compendium, returning it to his ranks.|$|E

Longstreet began the Siege of Suffolk on April 11, 1863. The 6th Massachusetts occupied {{a position on the}} right of the Union defensive siege lines <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>location</b> called Fort Nansemond by the bank of the Nansemond River.
