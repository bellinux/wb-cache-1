On the 25th anniversary documentary Blackadder Rides Again, Atkinson added that as the cameras were about to roll for the first time, he suddenly realised he wasn't even sure what voice to use for the character.|$|E

He added that the film's plot twist came somewhat accidentally. Having described the skeleton of the story to a friend during its development, the friend called him back {{a few days later}} to enquire about his film. The friend had mistakenly imagined sequences which he assumed to be parts of the plot, from which the twist ending was derived.|$|E

5|$|The {{emergency}} room {{is filled with}} victims from a chain car accident, one of whom is <b>admitted</b> <b>in</b> the department of neurosurgery, under the care of Shepherd and Yang. As the physicians soon discover that he has been internally decapitated, they {{come to the conclusion that}} even a minor move would result in irreparable damage. A pregnant woman is <b>admitted</b> <b>in</b> plastic surgery, after having her arm severed. Meredith is assigned to work for Sloan during the day, and is immediately told to find the arm, much to the fascination of her interns. Despite trying to deal with her trainees in a strict manner, Stevens is looked upon as unprofessional by the interns she was assigned to. Her image is further deteriorated when she decides to abandon her hospital duties, in order to perform surgery on a deer, once again letting her emotional involvement interfere with her career. Meredith and Shepherd discuss the repercussions of their breakup, and realize that they cannot reconcile. However, the two engage in sexual intercourse, as a manner to express their mutual feelings for the last time. O'Malley comes to the realization of his love for Stevens, and quickly discloses to her that he shares her romantic feelings.|$|E
5|$|The most {{competitive}} undergraduate programs are Medicine with a 0.5% acceptance rate, Architecture and Urbanism with 0.6%, and Communication with 2%. Such high competitivity leads many {{students to take}} preparatory courses during or after the last regular high school year called cursinhos in Portuguese, generally privately offered or managed by some association or organization. Many private cursinhos have special classes focused on highly competitive programs like medicine, making them very expensive. It is common to find students <b>admitted</b> <b>in</b> Medicine, Engineering and other programs {{after several years of}} preparatory courses.|$|E
5|$|A patient, Jillian Miller (Jessica Stroup), is <b>admitted</b> <b>in</b> {{obstetrics}} and gynaecology, and is revealed {{to suffer from}} advanced cervical cancer, which leads to her contacting her parents, from whom she ran away from years ago, along with her best friend Rachel Meyer (Rachel Boston). Stevens quickly becomes emotionally involved in the patient's situation and encourages her to return home, after learning that the two girls were Amish, shunned from their natal village. Torres and Yang operate on a runner who is <b>admitted</b> <b>in</b> orthopedics, coping {{with the news that}} he {{will never be able to}} compete in races after the extensive surgical procedure. Sloan announces his plans of returning to New York City, but abruptly decides to stay in Seattle, following Grey accidentally revealing Webber's retirement plans. Shepherd is displeased with Sloan's decision, which results in an argument between him and Grey, which threatens putting damage on their relationship. Webber returns to his wife, Adele (Loretta Devine), seeking forgiveness, but is left devastated at the realization that she has been spending the night with another man. Bailey ultimately finds support in Stevens, who proves enthusiastic to spend her entire US$8 million inheritance, for the opening of the free clinic. At the conclusion of the episode, Yang confides in Burke, who unexpectedly proposes to her, whereas O'Malley, who finally admits how affected he was by the death of his father, proposes to Torres.|$|E

5|$|Aykroyd {{had never}} written a {{screenplay}} before, as he <b>admitted</b> <b>in</b> the 1998 documentary, Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers, or even read one, {{and he was}} unable to find a writing partner. Consequently, he put together a very descriptive volume that explained the characters' origins and how the band members were recruited. His final draft was 324 pages, which was three times longer than a standard screenplay, written not in a standard screenplay format, but more like free verse. To soften the impact, Aykroyd made a joke of the thick script and had it bound with the cover of the Los Angeles Yellow Pages directory for when he turned it in to producer Robert K. Weiss. Landis was given the task of editing the script into a usable screenplay, which took him about two weeks.|$|E
5|$|In 1938 Vaughan Williams met Ursula Wood (1911–2007), {{the wife}} of an army officer, Captain (later Lieutenant-Colonel) Michael Forrester Wood. She was a poet, and had {{approached}} the composer with a proposed scenario for a ballet. Despite their both being married, and a four-decade age-gap, {{they fell in love}} almost from their first meeting; they maintained a secret love affair for more than a decade. Ursula became the composer's muse, helper and London companion, and later helped him care for his ailing wife. Whether Adeline knew, or suspected, that Ursula and Vaughan Williams were lovers is uncertain, but the relations between the two women were of warm friendship throughout the years they knew each other. The composer's concern for his first wife never faltered, according to Ursula, who <b>admitted</b> <b>in</b> the 1980s that she had been jealous of Adeline, whose place in Vaughan Williams's life and affections was unchallengeable.|$|E

5|$|Mary Leonard {{became the}} first woman {{admitted}} to the state bar on April 13, 1886, when the court admitted her after a year-long battle that included the state legislature passing a new law to allow women to be <b>admitted.</b> <b>In</b> 1906, the Oregon court upheld a maximum hour law for women in State v. Muller, 48 Or. 252, 85 P. 855 (1906). Due partly to a brief by future U.S. Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Oregon law in Muller v. Oregon, 208 U.S. 412 (1908) despite ruling in 1905 in Lochner v. New York that a maximum hour law for bakers was unconstitutional. Then in 1910, the state legislature expanded the court back to five justices, and lastly, in 1913 the court expanded to the current seven justices.|$|E
5|$|One of Briskin's children, Gerald (Jerry), {{also became}} a {{producer}} in the film industry, working at the same company as his father, Columbia. He also followed his father into the armed services during World War II, becoming a sergeant in the Signal Corps. Through Jerry, Briskin became a grandfather on May 23, 1944. Briskin's wife's name was Sara, and they had one other child, a son named Bernard. Throughout his life Briskin was a well-known philanthropist, and was quite active in Temple Israel in Los Angeles, as well as Cedars-Sinai Hospital, where he served as president. On Halloween 1968 (October 31), Briskin had a major heart attack and was <b>admitted</b> <b>in</b> critical condition to the hospital. He died two weeks later on November 14, 1968 at UCLA Medical Center, where he was under treatment.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{hardware}} units under Iwata's tenure, {{including the}} Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, {{were not as}} successful as the DS and Wii, and Nintendo's finances took a downward turn starting in 2010. During the development phase of the 3DS, a handheld device featuring stereoscopic 3D without the need of accessories, Iwata stated that his background in technology helped keep Nintendo's engineers in line. It was hoped that the successor to the Nintendo DS would reinvigorate the company after profits began declining. However, weak sales upon {{the release of the}} Nintendo 3DS caused the company's stock to fall by 12percent on July29, 2011. The console's poor sales prompted a price cut in August from its launch price of US$250 to US$170. Sales of the 3DS continually fell below expectations. Iwata later <b>admitted</b> <b>in</b> 2014 that he misread the market and did not appropriately account for changing lifestyles since the launch of the Wii. He continually placed focus on family-oriented games despite declining popularity.|$|E

5|$|The Judd School sixth form {{can be said}} to {{have been}} {{established}} as early as 1903in the wake of the Education Act of 1902when the Pupil Teachers Scheme was born and The Judd School was used a training centre for young teachers. However, normal pupils above the age of 16 were not permitted until 1919; previously special permission from the governors was required to stay on beyond this age. A 1952 government inspection stated that 42 students were in the sixth form. Judd's sixth form has significantly grown over the last decade, consisting of 308 students at the last Ofsted inspection in 2007. A minimum of 40 offers per year will be made to external applicants; girls are <b>admitted</b> <b>in</b> Year Twelve (aged 16) and make up about 16 percent of the sixth form. The sixth form has its own Common Room in the main school building, including a dedicated cafeteria and study area.|$|E
5|$|The life of {{the college}} was {{disrupted}} by the English Civil War. Leoline Jenkins, who became principal after the war in 1661, put the college on a more stable financial footing. Little happened at the college during the 18th century, and the 19th century saw a decline in numbers and academic standards. Reforms of Oxford University after two Royal Commissions {{in the latter half}} of the 19th century led to removal of many of the restrictions placed on the college's fellowships and scholarships, such that the college ceased to be predominantly full of Welsh students and academics. Students' academic achievements rose in the early 20th century as fellows were appointed to teach in new subjects. Women were first <b>admitted</b> <b>in</b> 1974 and now form a large part of the undergraduate population.|$|E

There are also several notable non-graduate alumni, including Louis Farrakhan, a leader of the Nation of Islam. Boston Latin admitted only male students at its founding in 1635. The school's first female student was <b>admitted</b> <b>in</b> the nineteenth century. In 1972, Boston Latin admitted its first co-educational class.|$|E
