5|$|The cartoon has {{inspired}} the play Nobody Knows I'm a Dog by Alan David Perkins. The play revolves around six different individuals unable to communicate effectively {{with people in}} their lives who find the courage to socialize on the Internet, protected by their <b>anonymity.</b>|$|E
5|$|The draft group {{allegedly}} comprised over 100 {{party members}} {{from across the}} country—including two MPs and one Senator (who, reportedly, had requested <b>anonymity).</b> In its only contact with the media, the campaign claimed it had nearly 3,000 visitors and 237 new supporters in less than ten hours.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from fighting Dyer ran various boxing gyms in London, successfully managing British flyweight champion Bert Kirby. Dyer {{then became a}} physical culture coach and was {{at the forefront of}} a diet fad in the 1920s based on fruit and vegetable drinks. Little is known of his life after the Second World War and he faded into <b>anonymity.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the Stuxnet attack, Kaspersky {{proposed}} that the Internet needed more regulation and policing. One idea was to have {{some parts of the}} Internet anonymous, while more secure areas require user identification. He argued that <b>anonymity</b> mostly benefited cybercriminals and hackers. For example, accessing a nuclear power plant network could require a verified identity through a digital passport.|$|E
5|$|Bowie shelved his solo {{career in}} 1989, {{retreating}} {{to the relative}} <b>anonymity</b> of band membership {{for the first time}} since the early 1970s. A hard-rocking quartet, Tin Machine came into being after Bowie began to work experimentally with guitarist Reeves Gabrels. The line-up was completed by Tony and Hunt Sales, whom Bowie had known since the late 1970s for their contribution, on bass and drums respectively, to Iggy Pop's 1977 album Lust For Life.|$|E
5|$|In February 2015, UBS {{announced}} {{to be investigated}} {{by the federal government}} over new charges stating that UBS facilitated tax evasion by its U.S. clients. The focus of the investigation lies on the possible sale of bearer bonds, a type of unregistered security that provides <b>anonymity</b> to the owner. UBS announced that it was cooperating with the investigators.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1970s, a bootleg {{containing}} rare {{singles and}} B-sides entitled The Dark Side of the Moo appeared, {{with a similar}} cover. Like Atom Heart Mother, the cover had no writing on it, although {{in this case it}} was to protect the bootlegger's <b>anonymity</b> rather than any artistic statement. The album cover to The KLF's concept album Chill Out was also inspired by Atom Heart Mother.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the baths {{served as}} {{community}} spaces for gay men. Even now, some men {{choose to go}} to the baths with their friends (even though they may not necessarily have sex with each other). While many men talk to each other at the baths, even forming long-lasting friendships or relationships, many others do not, preferring, for various reasons, <b>anonymity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Invader works incognito, often masked {{and largely}} at night. To guard his <b>anonymity</b> on camera during interviews, he pixellates {{his own image}} or wears a mask as a disguise. He claims {{that only a few}} people know his real name and his face, and that his parents think he works as a tiler in the {{construction}} industry.|$|E
5|$|Police {{continued}} to arrest homosexuals in large numbers, routinely bringing paddy wagons to gay bars and arresting their patrons. Charges were usually dismissed but those arrested often lost their <b>anonymity</b> when newspapers printed their names, addresses and places of employment. Officers also notified the employer and {{family of the}} accused, causing serious damage to their reputations.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{encounters}} at bathhouses are frequently, but not always, anonymous. Some {{feel that}} the <b>anonymity</b> adds to the erotic excitement: that is what, for these patrons, one goes to the bathhouse for. Bathhouse encounters sometimes lead to relationships, but usually do not. Bathhouses are still used by {{men who have sex}} with men and do not identify as gay or bisexual, including those that are closeted or in heterosexual relationships.|$|E
5|$|The article {{said that}} Essjay spent some 14 {{hours or more}} a day on Wikipedia but was careful to keep his online life a secret from his colleagues and friends. It portrayed Essjay as often taking his laptop to class {{so he could be}} {{available}} to other Wikipedians while giving a quiz. He asserted that he required <b>anonymity</b> to avoid cyberstalking.|$|E
5|$|The {{cast for}} the film {{featured}} Thanhouser's first leading male actor, Frank H. Crane, along with two stage actors, Isabelle Daintry and Fred Santley. Isabelle Daintry has one other known Thanhouser credit, but this marks Fred Santley's only known credit. During this era, {{the players in the}} film were not credited and <b>anonymity</b> was the rule.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{produced}} by the Rex Motion Picture Company and was released on November 7, 1912. It was released as a single reel. The film's length was approximately 592 feet. The production credits or cast are not known. During this era, {{the players in the}} film were not credited and <b>anonymity</b> was the rule.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Morales {{returned}} to her birthplace of Santiago. While few knew of her actions during the war, the men she served alongside remembered her well. When she appeared at the unveiling of the monument to the common Chilean roto at the Plaza Yungay, she received some of the most enthusiastic applause. After years of illness, she died in <b>anonymity</b> in the common room of a Santiago hospital on 25 August 1890, aged only 25. For her, widespread recognition came only after her death.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the season, she {{continued}} her successful run with four more World Cup wins. In March 2007, Neuner won the pursuit and mass start races at Holmenkollen in Oslo, Norway, and she won the sprint and pursuit events at the season final in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia, giving her seven career World Cup wins. She ended her first complete season fourth in the Overall World Cup standings and finished second in the pursuit discipline. In the course of three months, Neuner had emerged from <b>anonymity</b> to become one of Germany's most popular female athletes. At the end of 2007, she had earned an estimated 1.3million euros through sponsorship and endorsement deals.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Carlos Rodríguez Rodríguez {{was convicted}} on bank fraud charges {{and became an}} FBI {{informant}} {{in exchange for a}} lower sentence. However, due to the EPB's policies of <b>anonymity,</b> most of the information was hampered by the use of codenames and useless for the investigation. During this time, there were internal issues between Segarra and group leaders Ojeda and Avelino González, with the first being considered inefficient by the others and general concern arising from his reputation as an unfaithful husband. On January 25, 1985, the EPB detonated a bomb in an empty United States Courthouse, later noting that it was a tribute to Juan Antonio Corretjer.|$|E
5|$|In {{her next}} letter Hańska made {{arrangements}} for a trusted courier to collect letters from Balzac, and thereby {{allow for a}} direct correspondence. Before long she sent him the news {{that she and her}} husband would be traveling Europe, and visiting Vienna, Hanski's childhood home. They would also travel to the Swiss village of Neuchâtel, to visit the family of her daughter's governess. Contradicting her vow of eternal <b>anonymity,</b> she suggested a meeting. Balzac agreed immediately, and began to make preparations for the journey. Also, sometime in 1833, Balzac wrote his first confession of love to her, despite being at that time in another relationship.|$|E
5|$|Mayor Quimby is {{the subject}} of a citywide scandal when a barrage of reporters find a luxurious pool along with many scantily dressed women in Quimby's office. Homer keeps his <b>anonymity</b> while posting more rumors and finds out Mr. Burns plans to sell {{plutonium}} to terrorists and is later arrested by the CIA. Eventually, Mr. X wins the Pulitzer Prize for his journalistic achievements, despite nobody knowing who he is. When he hears that the prize money will be given to starving children, Homer reveals that he is Mr. X.|$|E
5|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{disguise}} are unknown. Hingley notes that many contemporary publications attempted to suggest women had {{played a role in}} their creation, perhaps to make them sound less threatening. He suggests that <b>anonymity</b> might have been necessary to protect Bloxam's position at Rugby, but notes Rugby was quite progressive, which makes this unlikely; and, finally, suggests modesty as a possibility. Ian Ridpath, noting the plagiarism of the art from A Celestial Atlas, suggests that this alone might be sufficient to cause the author to wish to remain anonymous.|$|E
5|$|The victim, as {{presented}} by Goya, is as anonymous as his killers. His entreaty is addressed not to God {{in the manner}} of traditional painting, but to an unheeding and impersonal firing squad. He is not granted the heroism of individuality, but is merely part of a continuum of victims. Beneath him lies a bloody and disfigured corpse; behind and around him are others who will soon share the same fate. Here, for the first time, according to biographer Fred Licht, nobility in individual martyrdom is replaced by futility and irrelevance, the victimization of mass murder, and <b>anonymity</b> as a hallmark of the modern condition.|$|E
5|$|Valor por Tamaulipas ("Courage for Tamaulipas") is a Facebook {{page that}} covered {{security}} updates in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. It {{was founded by}} an anonymous user on 1 January 2012, and its goal is to share information with other social media users on the drug-related violence and risk situations all across the state. With over 515,000 likes on Facebook, Valor por Tamaulipas routinely posted messages and photos of crime scenes on its page. In a country where many journalists have been assassinated for writing about drug trafficking and organized crime, the page survives under <b>anonymity,</b> {{but it has not}} been immune to threats.|$|E
5|$|Washed {{up and out}} of {{the public}} eye, Keating pleads with Toohey to use his {{influence}} to get the commission for the much-sought-after Cortlandt housing project. Keating knows his most successful projects were aided by Roark, so he asks for Roark's help in designing Cortlandt. Roark agrees in exchange for complete <b>anonymity</b> and Keating's promise that it will be built exactly as designed. After taking a long vacation with Wynand, Roark returns to find that Keating was not able to prevent major changes from being made in Cortlandt's construction. Roark dynamites the project to prevent the subversion of his vision.|$|E
5|$|After the 15 September incident, Blackman {{continued}} with his tour of duty, leaving Helmand Province in late October 2011. On 13 October 2012, at {{the decision of}} the Service Prosecution Authority, Marines A–E were charged with the murder of the unnamed Afghan insurgent. The lead came after British civilian police discovered suspicious video footage on a serviceman's laptop. Marines D and E had charges against them dropped on 5 February 2013. Marines A, B and C first appeared in court in August 2013, where they entered a not-guilty plea. The military trial of Marines A, B and C, protected from view in court behind a screen because of an <b>anonymity</b> order, began on 23 October 2013 and lasted two weeks. Their court-martial board (equivalent to a jury in the civilian justice system) was seven members strong, instead of the five used for less serious cases.|$|E
5|$|For some, {{being a part}} of a {{community}} is an important resource because they often report having felt ostracized. Although online communities exist, affiliation with online communities vary. Some question the concept of online community, while others depend on the online asexual community heavily for support. Elizabeth Abbott posits that there has always been an asexual element in the population, but that asexual people kept a low profile. While the failure to consummate marriage was seen as an insult to the sacrament of marriage in medieval Europe, and has sometimes been used as grounds for divorce or to rule a marriage void, asexuality, unlike homosexuality, has never been illegal, and it has usually gone unnoticed. However, in the 21st century, the <b>anonymity</b> of online communication and general popularity of social networking online has facilitated the formation of {{a community}} built around a common asexual identity.|$|E
5|$|In August 1982, he fronted a {{consortium}} – funded by Saudi brothers Mahmud and Mohammad Bhatti {{of the company}} Allied Properties – that took Wolverhampton Wanderers out of liquidation, beating a rival bid from Doug Ellis. The brothers wanted <b>anonymity,</b> and were only revealed to the public after investigation by journalists. He sacked manager Ian Greaves and replaced him with former Wolves teammate Graham Hawkins. However the council rejected planning permission for the club to construct a supermarket, and the Bhattis were {{unwilling or unable to}} provide further funding for the club. Wolves won promotion out of the Second Division in 1982–83, but were relegated out of the First Division in last place in 1983–84, and Dougan sacked Hawkins and replaced him with Tommy Docherty. Dougan resigned in January 1985.|$|E
5|$|Making {{contemporary}} political points {{in this way}} through reinterpretation of distant historical episodes was now common. In 17th century France, {{the fall of the}} powerful Cardinal Mazarin was celebrated in a political pamphlet that also drew parallels with the career of Sejanus, L'Ambitieux ou le portraict d'Aelius Sejanus en la personne du Cardinal Mazarin (Paris, 1642). In England other royal favourites were seen in these terms too. George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, is the target of an anonymous manuscript Roman tragedy, The Emperor’s Favourite. The prudent need for <b>anonymity,</b> is suggested by the arrest of Sir John Eliot, who was sent to the Tower of London for his outspoken criticism of the Duke in the 1626 parliament, comparing him to Sejanus.|$|E
5|$|Song scholar-officials {{were granted}} ranks, honors, and career {{appointments}} {{on the basis}} of merit, the standards of which were codified and more objective than those in the Tang dynasty. The <b>anonymity</b> of exam candidates guarded against fraud and favoritism by those who could judge papers based upon handwriting and/or signature calligraphy; a bureau of copyists was tasked with the job of recopying all the candidates' papers before grading. After passing the prefectural, provincial, and then palace exam (the most prestigious), scholarly degrees did not immediately ensure an appointment to office, but the more prestigious the degree, the more certain one's career in higher administrative posts would be. The central government held the exclusive right to appoint or remove officials. The case for removal was always carefully examined, since the central government kept a recorded dossier of reports on each official, stored in the capital for later review.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} attention of both flood and fire reached Joan Kroc, the McDonald's heiress, who anonymously (her <b>anonymity</b> was later {{revealed to the}} public by the Grand Forks Herald) donated $15,000,000 to be divided into $2,000 portions for each damaged household (though the amount some homeowners received was less due to the huge number of devastated homes; in all 7,500 households received funds). Additionally, another single anonymous donor gave $5 million which was distributed in $1,000 allotments. In November 1997, North Dakota Governor Ed Schafer reported that victims had been assisted by 50,000 relief agency volunteers who had served more than 2 million meals. Additionally, the communities received clothing and supplies that were donated from every U.S. state. During a concert in Fargo, the rock group KISS donated the money from sales of a special T-shirt to the Fargo and Grand Forks areas to assist in flood relief.|$|E
5|$|Wendell and Edith Willkie {{moved to}} New York in October 1929, only {{weeks before the}} Wall Street Crash of 1929, and found an {{apartment}} overlooking Central Park. Initially intimidated by the size and <b>anonymity</b> of the big city, Wendell Willkie soon learned to love it. He attended the Broadway theatre, and read through ten newspapers each day. Willkie {{and his wife had}} little in common, and grew apart through the 1930s. He acquired a social life, and met Irita Van Doren, the book review editor of the New York Herald Tribune who became a friend, and later his lover. Cultured, brilliant and well connected, Van Doren introduced him to new books, new ideas, and new circles of friends. Unlike Van Doren, Willkie was indiscreet about their relationship, and their affair was well known to the reporters covering him during his 1940 presidential campaign. None of them printed a word.|$|E
5|$|Having left Thompson's tradition, Buczynski {{decided to}} form his own form of Wicca, which he claimed had {{actually}} dated {{back to the}} Palaeolithic and transmitted to him by a figure whose <b>anonymity</b> he had to protect. Referring to this new tradition as Welsh Traditionalist Witchcraft or the Traditionalist Gwyddoniaid, it was heavily influenced by the Welsh mythology contained in texts like The Mabinogion and the Arthurian legends which fascinated him, despite his lack of Welsh heritage. It took as its basis {{the structure of the}} Gardnerian tradition, with its Book of Shadows being largely based upon that which he had obtained through his work with Thompson, accompanied by sections taken from the recently published Lady Sheba's The Book of Shadows. Officially founded in October 1972, later that year an outer court was founded through which to teach interested persons who were not yet initiated. Notably, he welcomed LGBT people and non-caucasians into his tradition {{at a time when they}} were denied entry to most other Wiccan covens. Although taking an open attitude to spiritual seekers, Buczynski prevented the occult investigator, Hans Holzer, from entering the outer coven when the latter requested admission to undertake research for his book The Witchcraft Report; like many in the Pagan and occult community, Buczynski was wary of Holzer's intentions and the sensationalist claims he purported in his publications.|$|E
5|$|The book {{consists}} of twelve chapters, plus an Epilogue and an Acknowledgements section at the end. Smith and MacKinnon individually write alternating chapters, {{each of which}} covers one month from March 2005 to February 2006. In the first chapter MacKinnon tells how his idea for the 100-mile diet began and Smith agrees to try it for one year. They begin symbolically {{on the first day}} of Spring, March 21, and define 'local' as 100 miles, a convenient radius that would include the Lower Mainland, the southern half of Vancouver Island, and Whatcom County and Skagit County in Washington State. Their exceptions to this rule include meals eaten while traveling, meals prepared by friends, and business lunches. Their initial month was expensive as they scoured grocery stores for whatever they could find. In the second chapter, Smith describes her and MacKinnon as an unwed urban couple in their early thirties with no children and living in a rented apartment. They recount how eating impacted their relationship before and after the diet, the <b>anonymity</b> of prepackaged foods, the traceability of their diet, and the diets of the Coast Salish.|$|E
5|$|The {{dramatic}} {{contrast between}} Ranavalona's isolationism and her son's pro-European stance represented an abrupt reversal of policy that threatened the traditional sociopolitical order. Radama's absolutism in pursuing dramatic reforms in disregard {{of the advice}} of his ministers ultimately turned them against him. In a coup led by his Prime Minister, Rainivoninahitriniony, Radama II was strangled on May 12, 1863. His wife Rabodo, who took the throne name Rasoherina, was allowed by the ministers to succeed her husband on the condition that she and future sovereigns would no longer rule unilaterally, but rather in concert with the Hova (the class of free citizens) as represented by the position of Prime Minister. The public was informed that Radama had committed suicide and that his body had been unceremoniously interred in a tomb in Ilafy. However, there soon emerged rumors – believed by prominent foreigners Jean Laborde and William Ellis – that Radama lived and was making plans to reclaim the throne. A strong case has since been {{made on the basis of}} significant evidence that Radama may indeed have revived after the strangling and lived to old age in <b>anonymity</b> near Lake Kinkony in the northwestern part of the island.|$|E
25|$|Blogs often give a {{sense of}} <b>anonymity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Reviewers {{are often}} {{anonymous}} and independent. However, some reviewers {{may choose to}} waive their <b>anonymity,</b> and in other limited circumstances, such as the examination of a formal complaint against the referee, or a court order, the reviewer's identity {{may have to be}} disclosed. <b>Anonymity</b> may be unilateral or reciprocal (single- or double-blinded reviewing).|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} Linux {{distributions}} created with privacy, secrecy, network <b>anonymity</b> and information security in mind, including Tails, Tin Hat Linux and Tinfoil Hat Linux. Lightweight Portable Security is a distribution based on Arch Linux and {{developed by the}} United States Department of Defense. Tor-ramdisk is a minimal distribution created solely to host the network <b>anonymity</b> software Tor.|$|E
