5|$|A Song of Ice and Fire {{takes place}} in a fictional world in which seasons last for years and end unpredictably. Nearly three centuries before the events of the first novel (see backstory), the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros were united under the Targaryen dynasty by Aegon I and his sisters Visenya and Rhaenys, with Aegon Targaryen {{becoming}} the first king of the whole of the continent of Westeros, save for the southerly Dorne. At the beginning of A Game of Thrones, 15 peaceful years have passed since the rebellion led by Robert Baratheon deposed <b>and</b> <b>killed</b> <b>the</b> last Targaryen king, Aerys II, and proclaimed Robert king of the Seven Kingdoms, with a nine year long summer coming to an end.|$|E
5|$|According to a 1992 article, the Iroquois, {{wielding}} weapons {{such as the}} tomahawk, killed 24 French {{and took}} more than 70 prisoners. Other sources, such as Encyclopædia Britannica, claim that 250 settlers and soldiers lost their lives during the “Massacre.” The Iroquois wanted to avenge the 1,200,000 bushels of corn burned by the French, but since {{they were unable to}} reach the food stores in Montreal, they kidnapped <b>and</b> <b>killed</b> <b>the</b> Lachine crop producers instead. Lachine was the main departure point for westward-traveling fur traders, a fact which may have provided extra motivation for the Mohawk attack.|$|E

5|$|After her commissioning, Karlsruhe was {{assigned}} to overseas duties in the Caribbean. She arrived {{in the area in}} July 1914, days before the outbreak of World War I. Once the war began, she armed the passenger liner , but while the ships were transferring equipment, British ships located them and pursued Karlsruhe. Her superior speed allowed her to escape, after which she operated off the northeastern coast of Brazil. Here, she captured or sank sixteen ships. While en route to attack the shipping lanes to Barbados on 4 November 1914, a spontaneous internal explosion destroyed the ship <b>and</b> <b>killed</b> <b>the</b> majority of the crew.

5|$|As {{a prelude}} to his planned {{campaign}} in Greece, Philip went on campaign {{in the winter of}} 339 BC, against the Scythians living south of the Danube, near the river's mouth (in Dobruja). He defeated them in battle, taking many captive, and built a statue of Heracles to commemorate his victory. He then marched through the territory of the Triballi in a demonstration of force, which probably lay upstream along the course of the Danube. During a skirmish, he was severely wounded in the leg when a spear passed through it <b>and</b> <b>killed</b> <b>the</b> horse he was riding. Recovering from this wound may have delayed Philip's campaign in Greece, since he did not set off until the autumn of 339 BC.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{frequent}} derailments, {{low speed}} meant Wotton Tramway {{had a good}} safety record. The locomotives occasionally ran over stray sheep, and on 12September1888 sparks {{from one of the}} Aveling and Porter engines blew back into one of the train's cattle trucks, igniting the straw bedding and badly burning two cows. The line had one serious accident, in which Ellen Maria Nickalls, a servant at Wotton House, was struck by a locomotive near Church Siding <b>and</b> <b>killed.</b> <b>The</b> coroner returned a verdict of accidental death, absolving driver James Challis.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} weeks, other isolated incidents occurred when whites in Paiute country were ambushed <b>and</b> <b>killed.</b> <b>The</b> Pony Express {{was a special}} target.

5|$|Famously, {{the much}} smaller Greek army held the pass of Thermopylae against the Persians {{for three days}} before being outflanked by a {{mountain}} path. Much of the Greek army retreated, before the Spartans and Thespians who had continued to block the pass were surrounded <b>and</b> <b>killed.</b> <b>The</b> simultaneous Battle of Artemisium was {{up to that point}} a stalemate; however, when news of Thermopylae reached them, the Allied fleet also retreated, since holding the straits of Artemisium was now a moot point.|$|E
5|$|He {{participated in}} the drive through France and was wounded in Aachen, Germany and was sent to England to recover. After he recovered, he rejoined the front lines reassigned to the 3rd Infantry Division and was given a {{battlefield}} commission to second lieutenant. By April 18, 1945, he was a first lieutenant in command of Company A, 15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division, 7th Army. On that day, he led his company in their advance through Nuremberg, Germany, and single-handedly engaged German forces several times. As his unit passed a city square, a German machine gun opened fire, causing several casualties. Daly rushed the position <b>and</b> <b>killed</b> <b>the</b> three gunners. Advancing ahead of his men, he came across a German patrol preparing to use rocket launchers to ambush American tanks. He again attacked alone and, despite being outnumbered and outgunned, killed all six patrol members. When a machine gun opened fire at close range, {{he picked up a}} dead man's rifle <b>and</b> <b>killed</b> <b>the</b> two-man German crew. On April 19, he was shot through the head; a bullet entered at his ear and exited from the opposite cheek. He was sent to England and eventually the United States to recuperate. At about the same time, his father, who had been wounded in France, was also being evacuated to the United States.|$|E

5|$|Lieutenants Nuge and Klaus, {{the other}} two Yellow Jacket {{commanding}} officers, were also soon shot <b>and</b> <b>killed.</b> <b>The</b> Yellow Jackets began to fall back from the main line, retreating with the sentinels.

During the charge Bartholomew was shot through the lower arm, breaking both bones. He was still clutching his sword when he was treated hours later. For his leadership during the Battle of Tippecanoe, Bartholomew was promoted to brigadier general.|$|E
