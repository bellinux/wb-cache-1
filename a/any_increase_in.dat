5|$|As {{the site}} of the Necropolis station had been {{intentionally}} chosen to abut the arches of the LSWR's viaduct, it acted as an obstacle to <b>any</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the number of lines serving Waterloo station. Urban growth in the area of what is now south west London, through which trains from Waterloo ran, led to congestion at the station, only slightly alleviated by the LSWR's 1877 takeover of the western LNC track. In the 1890s the situation became untenable, and the LSWR began to investigate the possibility of repositioning the LNC station to permit the expansion of the main line terminus.|$|E
5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly elastic (Ed is − ∞), <b>any</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the price, no matter how small, will cause the quantity demanded for the good to drop to zero. Hence, when the price is raised, the total revenue falls to zero. This situation is typical for goods that have their value defined by law (such as fiat currency); if a 5 dollar bill were sold for anything more than 5 dollars, nobody would buy it, so demand is zero.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the puffadder shyshark can {{be easily}} caught by hand. Not {{targeted}} by commercial fisheries because of its small size, it is taken incidentally and discarded by bottom trawlers operating between Mossel Bay and East London, and by fishing boats in False Bay. Many are hooked by recreational anglers casting from the shore, who also generally discard or kill them as minor pests. Some local exploitation of this species does occur for lobster bait and the aquarium trade. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the puffadder shyshark as Near Threatened. Although it remains abundant, the small range of this shark lies entirely within a heavily fished region, and <b>any</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> fishing activities or habitat degradation could potentially impact the entire population.|$|E

5|$|The bill {{itself was}} {{formally}} {{introduced to the}} House of Commons on 4 March 1907. The subject was debated in the House of Lords on 21 March, where the proposed changed to the Militia were strongly opposed. The bill had its second reading in the Commons on 9, 10, and 23 April, and was passed into Committee, where it was discussed at some length over nine days. The opposition to the bill, whilst verbose, was not very effective. Hugh Arnold-Forster, the previous War Secretary, argued that the Territorial Force would prove ineffective in opposition to conscripted Continental armies, whilst the Labour Party objected generally to <b>any</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> military strength. Most of the opposition came from partisans of the existing system; {{as well as the}} implacable opposition from the Militia element, supporters of the Yeomanry objected to the reduction in their daily rates (from 5s. 6d. to 2s. 8d.), whilst Sir Howard Vincent led the opposition from the Volunteers against the stricter control of the new regulations. However, the strong Liberal majority saw off all opposition, and the bill moved for a third reading on 19 June, where it passed with 286 votes to 63. The opposition was mainly led by the Irish MPs, who voted against the government for reasons unrelated to the bill, and some of the Labour Party; most of the Unionists, save a few like Vincent or Charles Dilke, abstained rather than oppose.|$|E

The process by which this is achieved should be undertaken with speed and secrecy so as not to deter efficiency-enhancing mergers. The twin requirements of speed and secrecy will, in turn, present problems in achieving fair process and the creation of precedent. ...|$|R

40|$|Clustering {{ensemble}} combines some clustering outputs {{to obtain}} better results. High robustness, accuracy and stability {{are the most}} important characteristics of clustering ensembles. Previous clustering ensembles usually use k-means to generate ensemble members. The main problem of k-means is initial samples which have high effect on final results. Refining initial samples of kmeans increases the complexity of algorithm significantly. In this paper we try to predict initial samples, especially for clustering ensemble, without <b>any</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>in</b> time complexity. In this paper we introduce two approaches to select the initial samples of k-means intelligently to generate ensemble members. The proposed methods increase both accuracy and the speed of convergence without <b>any</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>in</b> time complexity. Selecting one sample from each cluster of previous result and selecting k samples which have minimum similarity to each other from coassociation matrix are the two proposed method in refining initial samples of k-means. Clarity, simplicity, fast convergence and higher accuracy {{are the most important}} parameters of proposed algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the effect of proposed algorithm in convergence and accuracy of common datasets...|$|R

25|$|It can be {{observed}} from this equation that, ceteris paribus, <b>any</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> either vaccine coverage or vaccine effectiveness, including <b>any</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> excess of a disease's HIT, further reduces {{the number of cases}} of a disease. The rate of decline in cases depends on a disease's R0, with diseases with lower R0 values experiencing sharper declines. Vaccines usually possess at least one contraindication for a specific population for medical reasons, so it is vital for both effectiveness and coverage to be high so that herd immunity can be established to protect these individuals. Vaccine effectiveness is often, but not always, adversely affected by passive immunity, so additional doses are recommended for some vaccines while others are not administered until after an individual has lost his or her passive immunity.|$|E

The lack of convincing evidence of the effectiveness of charter schools has not been remedied by this brief's author nor by his prior publications. <b>Any</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> revenues in the Big Eight urban dis-tricts have little or {{nothing to do with the}} existence of charter schools.

Shannon's formulation defaults to Boltzmann's 19th century formulation of entropy in case all probabilities are equal.

25|$|If the {{frequency}} {{and the intensity of}} the incident radiation are fixed, the photoelectric current increases gradually with an increase in the positive potential on the collector electrode until all the photoelectrons emitted are collected. The photoelectric current attains a saturation value and does not increase further for <b>any</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the positive potential. The saturation current increases with the increase of the light intensity. It also increases with greater frequencies due to a greater probability of electron emission when collisions happen with higher energy photons.|$|E
