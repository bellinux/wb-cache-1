It is also shown that when nr>nt, the IBI can be eliminated without the need of any zero-padding or adding CP or precoding when the OFDM block length is not too small.

40|$|We {{consider}} numerical solutions of nonlinear multiterm fractional integrodifferential equations, {{where the}} order of the highest derivative is fractional and positive but is otherwise arbitrary. Here, we extend and unify our previous work, where a Galerkin method was developed for efficiently approximating fractional order operators and where elements of the present differential algebraic equation (DAE) formulation were introduced. The DAE system developed here for arbitrary orders of the fractional derivative includes an <b>added</b> <b>block</b> of equations for each fractional order operator, as well as forcing terms arising from nonzero initial conditions. We motivate and explain the structure of the DAE in detail. We explain how nonzero initial conditions should be incorporated within the approximation. We point out that our approach approximates the system and not a specific solution. Consequently, some questions not easily accessible to solvers of initial value problems, such as stability analyses, can be tackled using our approach. Numerical examples show excellent accuracy.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the author's earlier results, a new source {{function}} for a numerical wind-wave model optimized by the criterion of accuracy and speed of calculation is substantiated. The proposed source function includes (a) an optimized version of the discrete interaction approximation for parametrization of the nonlinear evolution mechanism, (b) a generalized empirical form of the input term modified by adding a special block of the dynamic boundary layer of the atmosphere, and (c) a dissipation term quadratic in the wave spectrum. Particular attention is given to a theoretical substantiation of the least investigated dissipation term. The advantages of the proposed source function are discussed by its comparison to the analogues used in the widespread models of the third generation WAM and WAVEWATCH. At the initial stage of assessing the merits of the proposed model, the results of its testing by the system of academic tests are presented. In the course of testing, some principals of this procedure are formulated. The possibility of using the testing results to study the physics of evolution processes in wind waves is shown. It is noted that the specially <b>added</b> <b>block</b> of the dynamic boundary layer of the atmosphere makes it possible to give an exhaustive description of the air-sea-interface's characteristics, which may be used to improve wave forecasting. This new modeling quality allows us to make a statement about the construction of a model of the next (fourth) generation. Comment: 17 pages, 10 Figure...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{engineering}} friendly one-step {{process has been}} used to prepare zirconium titanium mixed oxide beads with porosity on multiple length scales. In this facile synthesis, the bead diameter and the macroporosity can be conveniently controlled through minor alterations in the synthesis conditions. The precursor solution consisted of poly(acrylonitrile) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to which was <b>added</b> <b>block</b> copolymer Pluronic F 127 and metal alkoxides. The millimeter-sized spheres were fabricated with differing macropore dimensions and morphology through dropwise addition of the precursor solution into a gelation bath consisting of water (H 2 O beads) or liquid nitrogen (LN 2 beads). The inorganic beads obtained after calcination (550 °C in air) had surface areas of 140 and 128 m 2 g− 1, respectively, and had varied pore architectures. The H 2 O-derived beads had much larger macropores (5. 7 μm) and smaller mesopores (6. 3 nm) compared with the LN 2 -derived beads (0. 8 μm and 24 nm, respectively). Pluronic F 127 was an important addition to the precursor solution, as it resulted in increased surface area, pore volume, and compressive yield point. From nonambient XRD analysis, it was concluded that the zirconium and titanium were homogeneously mixed within the oxide. The beads were analyzed for surface accessibility and adsorption rate by monitoring the uptake of uranyl species from solution. The macropore diameter and morphology greatly impacted surface accessibility. Beads with larger macropores reached adsorption equilibrium much faster than the beads with a more tortuous macropore network. © 2010, American Chemical Societ...|$|E
40|$|A {{new series}} of {{amphiphilic}} di- and triblock copolymers of Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and Poly(perfluorohexylethyl methacrylate) (PFMA) has been synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization using mono- or bifunctional PEO macroinitiators. Small angle X-ray scattering studies above the melting temperature of the PEO block have revealed a composition dependent ordered morphologies of cubic arrangement of spheres (bcc), hexagonally packed cylinders (hpc) and lamellar microdomains. Crystallization was, however, found to destroy the ordered melt morphology and imposes a layered structure. Self-assembly in aqueous medium was explored by dynamic light scattering (DLS), and TEM. DLS data reveal the formation of small aggregates (micelles) and single chains in diblock copolymer solutions. In triblock copolymer aqueous solution, large clusters were the dominant scatterers {{in addition to the}} micelles and single chains. The individual micelles were assumed flower-like micelles having some chains dangling in solution and the large clusters as the loose aggregates formed by the intermicellar connection through bridges. Interfacial behavior and penetration into 1, 2 -diphytanoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DPhPC) monolayer by block copolymers at the air/water interface was studied by measuring the surface pressure (pi) -area (A) isotherms in conjunction with infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy. The pi/A isotherms of the block copolymers show pressure regimes corresponding to different conformations of the polymer chains, i. e. a pancake like conformation at low surface coverage, and a brush conformation at high surface pressures. Cytotoxicity of the block copolymers on K 562 human erythroleucemia cells reveal that these materials are nontoxic up to a copolymer concentration of 0. 2 wt. -%. The interaction of the copolymers with model bilayer membranes was studied by measuring the effect of block copolymers on the zeta-potential value {{and the size of the}} liposomes as function of <b>added</b> <b>block</b> copolymer concentration.

40|$|The wheel-rail {{interaction}} {{problem has}} been widely studied {{in the past few}} decades. In this problem, dynamic responses at the contact areas remain the central issue since they induce damage to the rail over time. In particular, the dynamic responses at the contact areas between the wheels and rails present difficulties in understanding and mathematical modeling. Even with the computer power one has today, its mathematical modeling employs the versatile numerical analysis method, the finite element method (FEM) remains a formidable challenge due to its extremely small contact areas and in turn the extremely high stress levels. In addition, friction at the contact areas is another challenge in the modeling. These extremely high stress levels and difficulties in modeling friction at the small contact areas lead to the simplified analytical and finite element (FE) models available in the literature. However, to-date, these simplified mathematical and computational models are far from satisfactory. Therefore, in the investigation reported here, simplified analytical and FE models are first studied {{in order to understand the}} parameters of the models and to provide a foundation for more detailed studies. In these simplified analytical and FE models, the wheels are treated as traveling point loads. Subsequently, a more detailed FE model employing three-dimensional (3 D) finite elements for the wheel and rail is studied while the computed results are compared with those of the same FE model but with the wheel replaced by the traveling point loads. In this model, frictions at the contact areas are considered. In parallel, the effect of block dampers on the dynamic responses at the contact areas is studied. Various configurations of attaching the block dampers to the rail are considered. Conclusions are then drawn from the accuracy and efficacy of replacing the wheels by traveling point loads, and the effect on the dynamic responses of <b>added</b> <b>block</b> dampers to the rail.

40|$|International audienceClustering data is {{challenging}} especially for two reasons. The dimensionality {{of the data}} is often very high which makes the cluster interpretation hard. Moreover, with high-dimensional data the classic metrics fail in identifying the real similarities between objects. The second challenge is the evolving nature of the observed phenomena which makes the datasets accumulating over time. In this paper we show how we propose to solve these problems. To tackle the high-dimensionality problem, we propose to apply a co-clustering approach on the dataset that stores the occurrence of features in the observed objects. Co-clustering computes a partition of objects and a partition of features simultaneously. The novelty of our co-clustering solution is that it arranges the clusters in a hierarchical fashion, and it consists of two hierarchies: one on the objects {{and one on the}} features. The two hierarchies are coupled because the clusters at a certain level in one hierarchy are coupled with the clusters at the same level of the other hierarchy and form the co-clusters. Each cluster of one of the two hierarchies thus provides insights on the clusters of the other hierarchy. Another novelty of the proposed solution is that the number of clusters is possibly unlimited. Nevertheless, the produced hierarchies are still compact and therefore more readable because our method allows multiple splits of a cluster at the lower level. As regards the second challenge, the accumulating nature of the data makes the datasets intractably huge over time. In this case, an incremental solution relieves the issue because it partitions the problem. In this paper we introduce an incremental version of our algorithm of hierarchical co-clustering. It starts from an intermediate solution computed on the previous version of the data and it updates the co-clustering results considering only the <b>added</b> <b>block</b> of data. This solution has the merit of speeding up the computation with respect to the original approach that would recompute the result on the overall dataset. In addition, the incremental algorithm guarantees approximately the same answer than the original version, but it saves much computational load. We validate the incremental approach on several high-dimensional datasets and perform an accurate comparison with both the original version of our algorithm and with {{the state of the art}} competitors as well. The obtained results open the way to a novel usage of the co-clustering algorithms in which it is advantageous to partition the data into several blocks and process them incrementally thus "incorporating" data gradually into an on-going co-clustering solutio...|$|E
