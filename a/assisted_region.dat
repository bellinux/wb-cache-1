40|$|The data {{presented}} here were collected as {{one component of}} a project aimed at developing a regional innovation strategy for the West Midlands region of England. Like most regional policy measures the regional innovation strategy programme was driven by concern over widening economic performance differences between (European) regions and {{was intended as a}} means of closing observed cohesion and technology gaps [Commission of the European Communities, 1998 Reinforcing Cohesion and Competitiveness Through Research, Technological Development and Innovation COM (98) 275]. More importantly, however, the notion that distinct regional innovation strategies may be developed in each <b>assisted</b> <b>region</b> is premised on a belief in underlying idiosyncrasies in regional resource endowments, competencies, institutional infrastructure, industry, and governance. In other words, it is premised on the belief that there exist, or may exist with sufficient encouragement or facilitation, distinct regional innovation systems within Europe (Thomas K, 2000 Regional Studies 34 190 - 198). Accordingly, my purpose in the current paper is to outline the basic precepts underpinning a systemic approach to innovation, generally, and a regional systemic approach, specifically. Thereafter, an attempt is made to map partially the existence, or indeed absence, of a West Midlands regional innovation system, proxied by available firm-level data, and to comment on the appropriateness of regional systems of innovation as units of analyses. ...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the next}} five years, Austria {{might be able to}} obtain about Sch 20. 9 billion from the EU Structural Fund. This would {{significantly}} enhance the importance of regional policy in Austria. Because projects supported by EU funds must be co-financed by the national government, the total volume of financing is likely to increase markedly: ECU 1, 163 million (63 percent) must be raised at the national level for the common regional policy. The incorporation of pre-existing support schemes and of infrastructure projects into the system of co-financing will, however, have the budgetary effects small; on the other hand, EU decisions on regional policy will {{play an important role in}} the design of national regional policy. It is also for this reason that the list of <b>assisted</b> <b>regions</b> in Austria agreed upon in the negotiations with the EU is of great importance. This list covers regions with 40. 9 percent of the population; it is about as comprehensive as in comparable countries. The differentiation between <b>assisted</b> and non-assisted <b>regions</b> clearly follows the logic of regional economics. The economic performance, as measured by GDP per capita, in Burgenland (Objective 5 b region) is markedly below that in the non-assisted regions; there are still significant differences with regard to the Objective 5 b regions. This does not hold, though, with regard to the Objective 2 regions; in these regions, however, labor market problems are very severe, with 11 jobless per vacancy. In the <b>assisted</b> <b>regions,</b> the potential for restructuring is limited by the scarcity of skilled labor. The unfavorable development of employment (1981 / 1991 – 1. 4 percent as compared to + 7. 5 percent in non-assisted regions) in the Objective 1 and Objective 5 b regions has been "solved" by commuting to non-assisted regions; even Objective 2 regions suffer from outmigration. Thus, <b>assisted</b> <b>regions</b> do indeed have to cope with more serious regional problems. Nonetheless, there are doubts whether the coverage of the agreed-upon assistance scheme is not too broad. Therefore, it must be hoped that Austria's policy makers will be able to resist the demands of less deserving areas included in the designated <b>assisted</b> <b>regions.</b> The regional incentive schemes as elaborated in the preparation of the EDPP provide adequate guidance for focusing assistance funds to the most disadvantaged areas.

40|$|Compared {{with the}} {{constitutional}} changes introduced {{elsewhere in the}} United Kingdom, in the English regions a more cautious approach has been adopted based on administrative decentralisation. A key feature of the government’s reforms has been the strengthening of regional spatial planning and {{the transfer of the}} regional planning function to unelected regional assemblies. We examine how far these reforms have <b>assisted</b> <b>regions</b> to achieve greater discretion over planning policies and a more corporate approach to spatial planning. Our central argument is that, given the absence of elected regional government in England, there are outstanding institutional, cultural, and resource obstacles to extending regional freedoms and flexibilities. Nonetheless, the introduction of new statutory regional spatial strategies, together with a greater commitment in Whitehall to coordinate regional budgets, offers a potential way forward. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{tests for}} the {{existence}} of long run inter-regional equilibrium relationships in income per capita within the UK over the period 1971 - 95. We examine both the cross-sectional and time-series evidence of inter-regional convergence. The time series approach allows us to investigate whether there are long-run regional equilibrium trends, whereas the cross-sectional analysis allows us to investigate whether the dispersion in per capita incomes between regions has narrowed. While it was found that some of the regions converged over time, there were no obvious explanations for why these regions converged and others did not. Moreover, with the exception of Northern Ireland and Scotland, regional policy appears to have had little impact on the relative positions of <b>assisted</b> <b>regions</b> in terms of their share of UK GDP. ...|$|R

40|$|In November 2005 the US Department of Labor 2 ̆ 7 s Employment and Training Administration {{announced}} a bold new initiativeöWorkforce Innovations in Regional Economic Development (known as WIRED).

Despite a sound basis in regional development theory, the implementation of WIRED fell short of its original goals that, in many cases, stymied regional attempts at innovation. The difficulties experienced by first-generation WIRED recipients led to a stark revision of the federal WIRED concept and a reversion to more traditional workforce development approaches. To be truly effective, future federal endeavors in regional economic development must overcome the persistent institutional divisions, legal impediments, and political pressures that work contrary to the desired goal of a flexible and competitive regional development strategy...|$|R
40|$|The paper surveys what {{is known}} from various data sources {{about the process of}} firm {{migration}} in the Netherlands. The availability and quality of data sources concerning firm migration are discussed, just as the development of firm migration processes in the past decades, and the impact of firm migrations on regional economic structures and regional employment. This impact is then compared with the impact of other firm demographic components, i. e. new firm establishments, and firm closures. Then the regional patterns of firm migration are shown – {{to the extent that the}} data sources allow - with a focus on the movements in and out of the national economic core region (the Randstad). Especially for the sector of manufacturing industry we witness a gradual change, from a clear-cut core-periphery deconcentration pattern in the past to a more erratic pattern at present. This is related to a gradual change in the main migration motives, from labour market shortages to lack of space and accessibility, and from hard to soft location factors. Finally the paper addresses the role of government policies in guiding firm migrations to policy <b>assisted</b> <b>regions</b> and locations. ...|$|R

40|$|European {{regional}} {{support has}} grown in parallel with European integration. The funds targeted at achieving greater economic and social cohesion and reducing disparities within the European Union (EU) {{have more than doubled}} in relative terms {{since the end of the}} 1980 s, making development policies the second most important policy area in the EU. The majority of the development funds have been earmarked for Objective 1 regions, i. e. regions whose GDP per capita is below the 75 % threshold of the EU average. However, the European development policies have come under increasing criticism based on two facts: the lack of upward mobility of <b>assisted</b> <b>regions</b> and the absence of regional convergence. This paper assesses, using cross-sectional and panel data analyses, the failure so far of European development policies to fulfil their objective of delivering greater economic and social cohesion by examining how European Structural Fund support is allocated among different development axes in Objective 1 regions. We find that, despite the concentration of development funds on infrastructure and, to a lesser extent, on business support, the returns to commitments on these axes are not significant. Support to agriculture has short-term positive effects on growth, but these wane quickly, and only investment in education and human capital – which only represents about one eight of the total commitments – has medium-term positive and significant returns. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{prepared}} for a conference on income convergence and European regional policy organized by the Bertelsmann Foundation, the World Bank and Fundación CIDOB. Over the last two decades, the EU has adopted an active cohesion policy aimed at reducing income disparities by subsidizing various types of investment programmes in the Union's poorest regions through the so-called Structural Funds. This policy has often been questioned {{on at least two}} different grounds. Perhaps the most common argument is that it has not worked: since most of the <b>assisted</b> <b>regions</b> continue to be relatively poor in spite of these programmes, EU grants are mostly a waste and should therefore be scrapped, or at least severely curtailed. The second objection, which is often not explicitly stated but often lurks behind calls for cuts in structural programmes, is based on the view that {{there is no reason why}} the EU should engage in redistribution across its constituent territories. The Commission's view on this last issue seems to be that such redistribution is necessary because economic integration will tend to hurt the poorer regions of the Union by facilitating the concentration of economic activity in certain core areas.

40|$|Background : Internal {{residential}} mobility {{is an important}} contributor to economic vitality, helping to address gaps in the labour market, <b>assisting</b> <b>regions</b> to develop comparative advantages, and encouraging the circulation of skills, capital, and networks within a country. Mobility is, however, a complex sociological phenomenon influenced by individual, household, and community-level variables. Objective : This article examines the combined impact of individual, household, and community characteristics on both short- and long-distance {{residential mobility}} in Canada. The study is motivated by a broader concern with economic development and community vitality, particularly in smaller towns and cities that have recently struggled to attract newcomers. Methods : A series of multilevel random intercept regression models are run on Canadian census data from 2006. Canada-wide findings are compared to those for five sizes of community - from small towns with fewer than 10, 000 people to major metropolitan cities. Results : Despite the continued growth of major metropolitan areas, city size is not an attractor in and of itself. Rather, {{one of the most}} powerful draws for both small towns and large cities is the diversity of the existing population, as measured by the proportion of residents who are immigrants and/or visible minorities. Conclusions : These findings challenge some long-held stereotypes about rural living, and suggest that rural development strategies ought to include measures for enhancing diversity as a means of attracting all types of internal migrants to small towns and cities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{presented}} assisted {{common information}} as a generalization of Gács-Körner (GK) common information at ISIT 2010. The motivation for our formulation was to improve upperbounds on {{the efficiency of}} protocols for secure two-party sampling (which {{is a form of}} secure multi-party computation). Our upperbound was based on a monotonicity property of a rate-region (called the <b>assisted</b> residual information <b>region)</b> associated with the assisted common information formulation. In this note we present further results. We explore the connection of assisted common information with the Gray-Wyner system. We show that the <b>assisted</b> residual information <b>region</b> and the Gray-Wyner region are connected by a simple relationship: the <b>assisted</b> residual information <b>region</b> is the increasing hull of the Gray-Wyner region under an affine map. Several known relationships between GK common information and Gray-Wyner system fall out as consequences of this. Quantities which arise in other source coding contexts acquire new interpretations. In previous work we showed that assisted common information can be used to derive upperbounds on the rate at which a pair of parties can securely sample correlated random variables, given correlated random variables from another distribution. Here we present an example where the bound derived using assisted common information is much better than previously known bounds, and in fact is tight. This example considers correlated random variables defined in terms of standard variants of oblivious transfer, and is interesting on its own as it answers a natural question about these cryptographic primitives.
