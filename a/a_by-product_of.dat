5|$|Rome's {{territorial}} {{expansion in}} Europe {{and across the}} Mediterranean, and its development of mining, led to it becoming the greatest producer of lead during the classical era, with an estimated annual output peaking at 80,000 tonnes.

Lead mining occurred in Central Europe, Britain, the Balkans, Greece, Anatolia, and Hispania, the latter accounting for 40% of world production.|$|E

Zirconium metal is much higher priced than zircon because the reduction processes are expensive.|$|E
5|$|After the French chemists Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, Louis Jacques Thénard, and Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac {{approved}} the experiments {{of the young}} pharmacist Balard, the results were presented at a lecture of the Académie des Sciences and published in Annales de Chimie et Physique. In his publication, Balard states that he changed the name from muride to brôme on the proposal of M. Anglada. Brôme (bromine) derives from the Greek βρωμος (stench). Other sources claim that the French chemist and physicist Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac suggested the name brôme for the characteristic smell of the vapors. Bromine was not produced in large quantities until 1858, when the discovery of salt deposits in Stassfurt enabled its production as <b>a</b> <b>by-product</b> <b>of</b> potash.|$|E

Each year about 20tonnes of the element is still produced as <b>a</b> <b>by-product</b> <b>of</b> the nuclear power industry. As much as 1000tonnes of plutonium may be in storage with more than 200tonnes of that either inside or extracted from nuclear weapons.|$|E
40|$|A general {{method for}} {{establishing}} {{the existence of}} quasi-periodic solutions of Hamiltonian systems for vortex lattices is illustrated in a simple example involving two degrees of freedom. The geometry of intersecting singular manifolds of the Hamiltonians introduces suitable canonical transformations which put the Hamiltonian into the form of singular weakly coupled oscillators. <b>As</b> <b>by-products</b> <b>of</b> this procedure, additional integrals of motion are found for the leading term in the transformed Hamiltonian.

5|$|Rhenium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Re and atomic number 75. It is a silvery-white, heavy, third-row transition metal in group 7 of the periodic table.

5|$|The mycelia (but not {{the fruit}} bodies) of Armillaria gallica {{are known to}} be bioluminescent. Experiments have shown that the {{intensity}} of the luminescence is enhanced when the mycelia are disturbed during growth or when they are exposed to fluorescent light. Bioluminescence is caused by the action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). The biological purpose of bioluminescence in fungi is not definitively known, although several hypotheses have been suggested: it may help attract insects to help with spore dispersal, it may be <b>a</b> <b>by-product</b> <b>of</b> other biochemical functions, or it may help deter heterotrophs that might consume the fungus.|$|E
5|$|The seventh symphony, the Sinfonia antartica (1952), <b>a</b> <b>by-product</b> <b>of</b> the composer's {{score for}} Scott of the Antarctic, has {{consistently}} divided critical opinion {{on whether it}} can be properly classed as a symphony. Alain Frogley in Grove argues that though the work can make a deep impression on the listener, it is neither a true symphony in the understood {{sense of the term}} nor a tone poem and is consequently the least successful of the mature symphonies. The work is in five movements, with wordless vocal lines for female chorus and solo soprano in the first and last movements. In addition to large woodwind and percussion sections the score features a prominent part for wind machine.|$|E
