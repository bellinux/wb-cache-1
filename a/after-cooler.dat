25|$|Inside the dryer, hot dry air {{is pumped}} {{into the bottom of}} the hopper {{containing}} the resin so that it flows up through the pellets, removing moisture on its way. The hot wet air leaves the top of the hopper and is first run through an <b>after-cooler,</b> because it is easier to remove moisture from cold air than hot air. The resulting cool wet air is then passed through a desiccant bed. Finally, the cool dry air leaving the desiccant bed is re-heated in a process heater and sent back through the same processes in a closed loop. Typically, residual moisture levels in the resin must be less than 50 parts per million (parts of water per million parts of resin, by weight) before processing. Dryer residence time should not be shorter than about four hours. This is because drying the material in less than 4 hours would require a temperature above 160°C, at which level hydrolysis would begin inside the pellets before they could be dried out.|$|E

In an engine, roughly half the waste heat arises (from the engine jacket, oil cooler and <b>after-cooler</b> circuits) as hot water which can be at up to 110 °C. The remainder arises as high-temperature heat which can generate pressurised hot water or steam by the use of an exhaust gas heat exchanger.|$|E
40|$|A {{critical}} {{enabling technology}} in the evolutionary development of Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) {{is the ability to}} predict the system performance under a variety of operating conditions. The ability to predict the system performance is critical for mission analysis and for control subsystem testing, {{as well as for the}} modeling of various failure modes. Performance must be accurately predicted during steady-state and transient operation, such as start-up, shut-down and <b>after-cooling.</b> The development and application of verified and validated system models has the potential to reduce testing, cost and time required for the technology to again reach flight-ready status. An integrated NASA/DOE team was formed in late 1991 to develop and implement a strategy for modeling NTP systems. It is the intent of the interagency team to develop several levels of computer programs, which vary in detail, to simulate NTP systems based on either prismatic, particle or advanced fuel forms. This paper presents an overview of the models under development by the interagency team. In addition, the status of the development and validation efforts for the Level 1 steady-state parametric model is discussed...|$|R
5000|$|ASh-82T (M-82T) - New {{version of}} the ASh-82FNV {{developed}} in the early fifties for civilian aircraft. Previous version twin superchargers were replaced with a large single-speed compressor attached to an <b>after-cooler</b> (the critical altitude was 2,000 m, 6,561 ft). New alloys were used and some components were upgraded, thus reducing maintenance operations. Special care was put into reducing the engine noise level and an optional exhaust double silencer was available. The engine had a new fuel injection system and improved specific fuel consumption. A four-blade high efficiency propeller, the Typ AV-50m, was developed for the 82T version. Take-off power was 1,900 hp (1,417 kW) at 2,600 RPM, with 95 octane Avgas. Maximum continuous power was 1,630 hp (1,215 kW). At 85 octane Avgas and minor modifications, power output was rated at 1,700 hp (1,268 kW).|$|E
5000|$|ASh-2TK and ASh-2K (ASh-4K) - Four-row {{versions}} of the ASh-82, developed in the late '40s. The ASh-2TK had a two-stage two-speed supercharging system with intercooler (similar to the ASh-73) that compromised the engine's long TBO. Finally the ASh-2TK was discarded and a new version was developed, the ASh-4K, with an experimental variable-speed turbocharger and <b>after-cooler,</b> which allowed a cruising altitude of 11,000 m (36,089 ft). The engine had 82.4 litres (5,030 cu in) and 4,000 HP (2,985 kW) at 2,600 RPM (dry). The Ash-2K (ASh-4K) version had 4,700 HP (3,507 kW) wet, with a water-methanol system. For political reasons, these engines were prematurely installed in Tupolev Tu-4LL testbeds {{at the end of}} 1950, when the prototypes' initial tests had barely begun. The engines had various teething and overheating problems, and required a long testing period. Most of the flaws were fixed in the mid-fifties, but the production was cancelled: in those days, the priority for the Soviet Air Force were the turboprop and jet engines.|$|E

30|$|The filter removes {{any large}} piece of debris and liquid that may have become mixed with the gas. Then it enters a compressor. This raises the {{pressure}} until it is high enough for the gas {{to be used as}} a fuel. During compression, the temperature of the gas rises and must be cooled down by an <b>after-cooler.</b> Inside the <b>after-cooler,</b> the temperature of the gas is lowered and this allows for any remaining moisture to be condensed. The gas is then filtered a second time to remove condensed moisture. At this stage, the gas is re-heated to prevent any further condensation and is thus ready {{to be used as a}} renewable energy fuel. All these processes take seconds.|$|E
40|$|All {{over the}} world huge masses of gas are {{compressed}} {{in a number of}} storage stations to compensate seasonal fluctuations of the users’ demand versus the methane extraction from geological deposits. In the great majority of such plants, turbocompressors are used, namely centrifugal machines. Since in this kind of machines compression is essentially adiabatic, gas temperature rises up even to dangerous values. Natural gas cannot be injected into the reservoirs too hot without risk of geological damage, so often an <b>after-cooler</b> has to be provided. Natural gas compressors are driven by gas turbines (GT), fuelled by part of the gas flowing through the station; otherwise electric motors connected to the general grid are used. In the paper the exploitation of the renewable energy of the wind to drive the compressors of the system is proposed. The matching with the driving wind turbine is different from the matching with a gas turbine or an electric motor. However whereas the stochastic character of the wind source affects power generation seriously, in the proposed use it is not a real problem: the only constraint consists of having enough wind energy to complete a charge all over a season. An in-house code, based on the lumped parameter approach and a quasi-steady dynamics, has been developed in order to simulate the system performance during a complete charge for a known wind distribution. The turbo-compressor is modeled through its characteristic maps. Similarly the wind turbines, that drive the storage station, and the fans, that counterbalance the friction losses of the <b>after-cooler,</b> are replaced with their characteristic curves. The <b>after-cooler,</b> which is a gas-air compact heat exchanger, is modeled by means of the overall heat transfer coefficient and the total pressure losses. Finally the reservoir is supposed omothermal and isothermal. In order to investigate the plant performance, different kinds of wind distributions have been considered and the corresponding operation paths as well as power and pressure evolutions are shown and discussed...|$|E

40|$|An Integrated Multispectral Atmospheric Sounder (IMAS) {{cryocooler}} {{has been}} developed {{over the past two}} years for providing on the order of 0. 5 -watt cooling at 55 K in a lightweight compact configuration. The design goal for the cooler was a factor-of-three in size and mass reduction over the AIRS cooler design. In addition, the efficiency goal for the 0. 5 -watt at 55 K cryogenic load was a compressor input power of less than 50 W/W- 50 % lower than the AIRS cooler at that cooling capacity. The developed cooler incorporates a vibrationally balanced compressor with heat spreader in the center plate; this further increases the total system effi-ciency by maintaining a temperature difference of < 5 °C between the <b>after-cooler</b> and the heat-rejection interface. Two different coldheads have been designed for the IMAS application: an integral-linear option, and a split-coaxial option. The integral-linear option offers efficient per-formance, and a single warm mechanical/thermal interface. The split-coaxial option offers com-pactness and some cold interface system advantages. The development of the IMAS cryocooler is presented together with thermal, vibration, and EM 1 performance data gathered on the com-pleted cooler both at TRW and at JPL...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} the studies conducted on turbocharged producer gas engines designed originally {{for natural gas}} (NG) as the fuel. Producer gas, whose properties like stoichiometric ratio, calorific value, laminar flame speed, adiabatic flame temperature, and related parameters that {{differ from those of}} NG, is used as the fuel. Two engines having similar turbochargers are evaluated for performance. Detailed measurements on the mass flowrates of fuel and air, pressures and temperatures at various locations on the turbocharger were carried out. On both the engines, the pressure ratio across the compressor was measured to be 1. 40 +/- 0. 05 and the density ratio to be 1. 35 +/- 0. 05 across the turbocharger with <b>after-cooler.</b> Thermodynamic analysis of the data on both the engines suggests a compressor efficiency of 70 per cent. The specific energy consumption at the peak load is found to be 13. 1 MJ/kWh with producer gas as the fuel. Compared with the naturally aspirated mode, the mass flow and the peak load in the turbocharged after-cooled condition increased by 35 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively. The pressure ratios obtained with the use of NG and producer gas are compared with corrected mass flow on the compressor map...|$|E
40|$|The Evaporative Gas Turbine Pilot Plant {{has been}} in {{operation}} at Lund Institute of Technology in Sweden since 1997. In this cycle low-grade heat in the flue gases is utilized for water evaporation into the compressed air in the humidification tower. This result in, amongst others, power augmentation, efficiency increase and lower emissions. This article presents the experimental and theoretical results of the humidification tower, in which simultaneous heat and mass transfer occurs. A theoretical model has been established for the simultaneous heat and mass transfer occurring in the humidification tower {{and it has been}} validated with experiments. The humidification tower in the pilot plant can be operated at several operating conditions. An <b>after-cooler</b> makes it possible to chill the compressor discharge air before entering the humidification tower. The saturation temperature of the incoming compressed air can thereby be varied from 62 to 105 °C at the operating pressure of 8 bar(a). It has been shown that the air and water can be calculated throughout the column in a satisfactory way. The height of the column can be estimated with an error of 10 % compared with measurements. The results from the model are most sensitive of the properties of the diffusion coefficient, viscosity and thermal conductivity due to the complexity of the polar gas mixture of water and air...|$|E
40|$|TutorialTutorial 10 A: Centrifugal {{compressors}} {{are subject}} to transient events, such as emergency shutdowns, which can cause energetic surge events during rapid shutdown transients. Many modeling tools are used to predict the behavior of compressor systems during fast transient events. Even more, centrifugal compressor dynamic modeling is a valuable assessment tool that can help improve {{the design of the}} compressor anti-surge system to prevent harsh conditions while the unit is coasting down. Modeling of centrifugal compressor transient events requires a detailed evaluation of many system variables to obtain accurate results. Additionally, many parameters should be included and analyzed to adjust the model and obtain acceptable predictions. Those parameters can include recycle valve characteristics, the controller and actuator, suction and discharge piping volumes, aftercoolers, and operating conditions. Other parameters, such as machine coast down speed and inertia and different control response times will determine if the compressor will reach its surge limit at a detrimental high head condition, avoid it or go through it at low acceptable energy conditions. Many designs use general guidelines to select and plan the compressor anti-surge system and its main components. For example, the recycle valve type, size and actuation time are key parameters during the shutdown of the compressor unit since they directly affect the amount of flow through the compressor and its reaction time. Other factors are also relevant and should be assessed in detail to assure a proper design to avoid such transient events as a sudden shutdown of a compressor from a full load or high head operating conditions resulting in damaging surge events. In order to refine the simulation approach of the transients in centrifugal compressors, an extensive assessment has been conducted of the main parameters that will affect the modeling predictions. Parameters such as recycle valve size, type, actuation time, <b>after-cooler</b> volume, friction factors, unit speed coast down predictions, compressor map, isolation valve control, acting time, as well as placement of the discharge check valve influence the modeling predictions considerably. Therefore, parametric studies of some of those variables have helped to refine and adjust the modeling technique while improving the accuracy of the results. Moreover, computational predictions have been compared against high fidelity ? high accuracy data collected in a full scale compressor system. Initial comparisons indicated reasonable results while adjustments in the technique and main assumptions improved the modeling predictions considerably. A generic methodology to improve modeling predictions and main considerations are part of the analysis. In addition, a comparison of the modeling results and experimental data are presented and complemented with parametric studies of different variables. In general, this work should provide guidelines for advancing the modeling of centrifugal compressor transients as well as showing the application of a valuable tool for designing surge control systems for centrifugal compressors...|$|E
