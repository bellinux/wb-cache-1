Acoustic forces from travelling waves are rarely used in such devices.

50|$|A node {{is a point}} along a {{standing}} wave where the wave has minimum amplitude. For instance, in a vibrating guitar string, {{the ends of the}} string are nodes.

50|$|Reed {{instruments}} such as {{the clarinet}} or oboe have a flexible reed or reeds at the mouthpiece, forming a pressure-controlled valve. An increase in pressure inside the chamber will decrease the pressure differential across the reed; the reed will open more, increasing the flow of air.The increased flow of air will increase the internal pressure further, so a pulse of high pressure arriving at the mouthpiece will reflect as a higher-pressure pulse back down the tube. Standing waves inside the tube will be odd multiples of a quarter-wavelength, with a pressure <b>anti-node</b> at the mouthpiece, and a pressure node at the open end.

5000|$|On 23 February 1549 the [...] "water {{miracle of}} Constance" [...] is {{reported}} to have happened: the Seerhein rose and fell over several hours at intervals of about {{a quarter of an hour}} by a ell, more than half a meter. Fishermen on the Lower Lake reported that the water of the Rhine appeared to flow backwards. Today, this event can be explained scientifically: Certain wind conditions induce waves at the natural frequency of the upper and lower lake. This creates a seiche, i.e. standing wave, in which the entire lake resonates at its natural frequency. As it happens, Constance is close to an <b>anti-node</b> in this wave, making the effect especially visible.|$|E
50|$|Sonoluminescence {{can occur}} when a sound wave of {{sufficient}} intensity induces a gaseous cavity within a liquid to collapse quickly. This cavity {{may take the}} form of a pre-existing bubble, or may be generated through a process known as cavitation. Sonoluminescence in the laboratory can be made to be stable, so that a single bubble will expand and collapse over and over again in a periodic fashion, emitting a burst of light each time it collapses. For this to occur, a standing acoustic wave is set up within a liquid, and the bubble will sit at a pressure <b>anti-node</b> of the standing wave. The frequencies of resonance depend on the shape and size of the container in which the bubble is contained.|$|E

Mancers who cannot draw from a distat node's field must rely on charged crystals, while clankers, constructs and any other devices of the Art will not work. There are also rare places called <b>anti-nodes,</b> where the Art does not work or is at least greatly reduced.|$|R
5|$|For a {{transmission}} line carrying sinusoidal waves, {{the phase of}} the reflected wave is continually changing with distance, {{with respect to the}} incident wave, as it proceeds back down the line. Because of this continuous change there are certain points on the line that the reflection will be in phase with the incident wave and the amplitude of the two waves will add. There will be other points where the two waves are in anti-phase and will consequently subtract. At these latter points the amplitude is at a minimum and they are known as nodes. If the incident wave has been totally reflected and the line is lossless, there will be complete cancellation at the nodes with zero signal present there despite the ongoing transmission of waves in both directions. The points where the waves are in phase are <b>anti-nodes</b> and represent a peak in amplitude. Nodes and <b>anti-nodes</b> alternate along the line and the combined wave amplitude varies continuously between them. The combined (incident plus reflected) wave appears to be standing still on the line and is called a standing wave.|$|R
50|$|Multiple Nodes. Because of {{the central}} {{location}} of the <b>anti-node,</b> the center of expansion of DR3-DQ2 with the recolonization of western Europe after the last glacial maximum has been obscured. However, the frequency is still high within the Basque of NE Spain, including some Super-B8 haplotype. The highest frequency of this node is in Western Ireland. Despite its high frequency Ireland is not likely {{the source of the}} haplotype in European, but a region that has been least disturbed by the negative selection of wheat culture and migrations. Much of Ireland was covered in glacial ice in the late paleolithic and few exploitable resources. Colonization started about 10500 years ago, whereas neolithization started about 6500 years ago and was dominated by cattle culture with some wheat and minor barley cultivation. The paleontology of Europe during the last glacial maximum suggests that the most likely places of origin are NE Iberia, Southern France and new ice-core evidence suggests that final spread northward probably occurred after Younger Dryas.|$|E
50|$|Standing {{waves are}} also {{observed}} in physical media such as strings and columns of air. Any waves traveling along the medium will reflect {{back when they}} reach the end. This effect is most noticeable in musical instruments where, at various multiples of a vibrating string or air column's natural frequency, a standing wave is created, allowing harmonics to be identified. Nodes occur at fixed ends and anti-nodes at open ends. If fixed at only one end, only odd-numbered harmonics are available. At the open end of a pipe the <b>anti-node</b> will not be exactly at the end as it is altered by its contact with the air and so end correction is used to place it exactly. The density of a string will affect the frequency at which harmonics will be produced; the greater the density the lower the frequency needs to be to produce a standing wave of the same harmonic.|$|E
