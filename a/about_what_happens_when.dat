500|$|As {{the sixth}} and seventh seasons saw Daenerys, Sansa and Cersei assume ruling positions, Alyssa Rosenberg of the Washington Post noted that the series {{could be seen as}} a [...] "long-arc revenge fantasy <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> women who have been brutalized and raped gain power"—namely, that their past leaves them too broken to do {{anything}} but commit brutal acts in their own turn, and that their personal liberation does not effect the social change needed to protect others from suffering.|$|E
500|$|The series {{not only}} explores Khan's {{conflicts}} with supervillains but also explores conflicts with Khan's home and religious duties. Wilson, a convert to Islam, said [...] "This is not evangelism. It {{was really important}} for me to portray Kamala as someone who is struggling with her faith." [...] Wilson continued, [...] "Her brother is extremely conservative, her mom is paranoid that she's going to touch a boy and get pregnant, and her father wants her to concentrate on her studies and become a doctor." [...] Amanat added, As much as Islam is a part of Kamala’s identity, this book isn't preaching about religion or the Islamic faith in particular. It's <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> you struggle with the labels imposed on you, and how that forms your sense of self. It's a struggle we've all faced in one form or another, and isn't just particular to Kamala because she's Muslim. Her religion is just one aspect of the many ways she defines herself.|$|E
500|$|Skelton's {{season premiere}} for the 1960–1961 {{television}} season was {{a tribute to}} the United Nations. Six hundred people from the organization, including diplomats, were invited {{to be part of the}} audience for the show. The program was entirely done in pantomime, as UN representatives from 39 nations were in the studio audience. One of the sketches he performed for the UN was that of the old man watching the parade. The sketch had its origins in a question Skelton's son, Richard, asked his father <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> people die. He told his son, [...] "They join a parade and start marching." [...] In 1965, Skelton did another show in complete pantomime. This time he was joined by Marcel Marceau; the two artists alternated performances for the hour-long program, sharing the stage to perform Pinocchio. The only person who spoke during the hour was Maurice Chevalier, who served as the show's narrator.|$|E

500|$|... "Indestructible" [...] {{was written}} by Robyn and Klas Åhlund with {{production}} done by the latter. The song was recorded at a studio named Apmamman, in Stockholm, Sweden. The strings in the song were arranged by Carl Bagge, and played by various cello and violin players. The song alongside [...] "Hang with Me" [...] {{were among the first}} songs to be recorded for the Body Talk series, and Robyn said that she saved them for a later release because [...] " [...] knew they would be singles, or could be singles, and [...] wanted them to get that chance." [...] Robyn described the song to The Macomb Daily as [...] "a love song ... about what you can do in a club". In an interview with MTV News, she elaborated on the song's theme and message, saying, [...] "I think 'Indestructible' is a song that talks <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> you meet new people and fall in love, and how that can be scary and fun at the same time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Christians will {{sometimes}} {{point out that}} in their points of view, the wrongdoings of other Christians are not the fault of their religious scriptures but {{of those who have}} wrongly interpreted it. They posit that the mistakes of Christians do not refute the validity of their teachings, but merely proves their weakness and sinful nature, of which they then turn to Christ. Thus, according to them, the [...] "Word of God" [...] can still be true and valid without it having been accurately followed. According to Ron Sider, an Evangelical theologian, [...] "The tragedy is that poll after poll by Gallup and Barna show that evangelicals live just like the world. Contrast that with what the New Testament says <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> people come to living faith in Christ. There's supposed to be radical transformation {{in the power of the}} Holy Spirit (2 Cor 5:17, 1 Cor 10:13). The disconnect between our biblical beliefs and our practice is just, I think, heart-rending." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gartside's {{change in}} beliefs {{directly}} affected {{the music and}} particularly the lyrics of Songs to Remember. In one interview with NME in October 1981 he told the paper, [...] "The politics have moved from an essentialist and reductionist position in which we believed in a history of science which could {{make sense of the}} future to one that realized that what you've got is needs, demands, and desires, and you go out and you fight for them. Which means that your music will at points be indexed fairly clearly to Politics with a big 'P' and at other points will cut across it completely." [...] In another interview with The Face the following year Gartside said, [...] "My loss has been political conviction, the idea of a correct understanding of the past, present and future (Marxism). I've always been obsessively concerned that my understanding of political truth should be scientifically grounded. Many songs [...] are <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> the anchor points of political, moral or religious understanding fall away." [...] For example, he stated that the track [...] "Faithless" [...] was about [...] "how living without faith brings you both happiness and sadness. I've never had any religion, except maybe politics, although I am interested in having some means of achieving social order and progress." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{development}} of American science fiction as a self-conscious genre dates {{in part from}} 1926, when Hugo Gernsback founded Amazing Stories magazine, which was devoted exclusively to science fiction stories. Though science fiction magazines had been published in Sweden and Germany before, Amazing Stories was the first English language magazine to solely publish science fiction. Since he is notable for having chosen the variant term scientifiction to describe this incipient genre, the stage in the genre's development, his name and the term [...] "scientifiction" [...] are often thought to be inextricably linked. Though Gernsback encouraged stories featuring scientific realism to educate his readers about scientific principles, such stories shared the pages with exciting stories with little basis in reality. Much of what Gernsback published {{was referred to as}} [...] "gadget fiction", <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> someone makes a technological invention. [...] Published in this and other pulp magazines with great and growing success, such scientifiction stories were not viewed as serious literature but as sensationalism. Nevertheless, a magazine devoted entirely to science fiction was a great boost to the public awareness of the scientific speculation story. Amazing Stories competed with several other pulp magazines, including Weird Tales (which primarily published fantasy stories), Astounding Stories, and Wonder Stories, throughout the 1930s. It was in the Gernsback era that science fiction fandom arose through the medium of the [...] "Letters to the Editor" [...] columns of Amazing and its competitors. In August 1928, Amazing Stories published Skylark of Space and Armageddon 2419 A.D., while Weird Tales published Edmond Hamilton's Crashing Suns, all of which represented the birth of space opera.|$|E
