2500|$|In 1951, as part {{of testing}} of {{aircraft}} for Strategic Air Command Escape and Evasion missions, the prototype USAF Douglas YC-47F [...] "Super DC-3" [...] conducted short-field landings with and without a drogue chute as well as RATO (rocket <b>assisted</b> <b>take-off)</b> tests from rough terrain at Eglin Air Force Base. Also tested was the Chase XC-123 Avitruc modified from the Chase XCG-20 glider, and a Fairchild C-119C Flying Boxcar.|$|E

50|$|CATOBAR (Catapult <b>Assisted</b> <b>Take-Off</b> But Arrested Recovery or Catapult <b>Assisted</b> <b>Take-Off</b> Barrier Arrested Recovery) is {{a system}} used for the launch and {{recovery}} of aircraft from the deck of an aircraft carrier. Under this technique, aircraft launch using a catapult-assisted take-off and land on the ship (the recovery phase) using arrestor wires.|$|E
50|$|Variant for South Africa. Wings {{could be}} folded, but folding {{was no longer}} powered. Aircraft could be {{equipped}} with two Bristol Siddeley 605 single-stage RATO rockets to <b>assist</b> <b>take-off</b> from hot-and-high airfields like that of AFB Waterkloof in Pretoria, where the type was mostly based.|$|R
50|$|The {{airfield}} {{was based}} upon the standard Class A airfield for wartime operations with pan dispersals and concrete runways. The runway pattern was aligned with prevailing winds to <b>assist</b> <b>take-offs</b> and landings. The airfield originally had a standard bomber type control tower which was demolished sometime before 1955.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{prototype}} - Seagull serial PA143 - {{first took}} off on 14 July 1948 from Southampton Water, flown by test pilot Mike Lithgow. The second aircraft - PA147 - flew in September 1949, and was used for carrier trials on [...] later in that year, during which it demonstrated the capability to carry five passengers. Experiments were also carried out with rocket <b>assisted</b> <b>take-offs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|PB2Y-3s {{converted}} {{with four}} [...] Pratt & Whitney R-1830-92 Twin Wasp engines, increased fuel capacity and provision for RATOG (rocket <b>assisted</b> <b>take-off</b> gear).|$|E
50|$|During World War II the HWK {{developed}} {{and built a}} variety of rocket engines for <b>assisted</b> <b>take-off</b> (RATO), and guided missiles, before developing main propulsion engines for rocket-powered interceptor aircraft, notably the Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet and the Bachem Ba 349 Natter.|$|E
50|$|STOBAR (Short Take Off But Arrested Recovery) is {{a system}} used for the launch and {{recovery}} of aircraft from the deck of an aircraft carrier, combining elements of both STOVL (Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing) and CATOBAR (Catapult <b>Assisted</b> <b>Take-Off</b> But Arrested Recovery).|$|E
50|$|Construction of {{test rigs}} and a static test {{fuselage}} {{was carried out}} throughout 1947 and the final propulsion arrangement was settled by a Council of Ministers directive on 11 March 1947, calling for the development and construction of a medium bomber powered by four Lyul'ka TR-1A turbojets. To <b>assist</b> <b>take-off</b> the Su-10 could also use four U-5 JATO boosters fitted on the lower rear fuselage sides.|$|R

50|$|Aircraft launch {{under their}} own power using a {{ski-jump}} to <b>assist</b> <b>take-off</b> (rather than using a catapult like most carriers). However, these are conventional, rather than STOVL aircraft, and thus require arrestor wires {{to land on the}} ship. The STOBAR system is simpler to build than CATOBAR — but it works only with aircraft that have a high thrust to weight ratio. As of 2015, it has only been used regularly on Russian, Indian, and Chinese carriers.|$|R
5000|$|ASN-7 is a fixed wing UAV in {{conventional}} layout with high wing configuration and V-tail. Propulsion {{is provided by}} a two-blade propeller driven tractor engine mounted in the nose. ASN-7 can be launched with solid rocket <b>assisted</b> <b>take-off,</b> and after separation, the rocket casing can be reused. Specification: ...|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two main}} philosophies {{in order to keep}} the deck short: add thrust to the aircraft, such as using a Catapult <b>Assisted</b> <b>Take-Off</b> (CATO-); and {{changing}} the direction of the airplanes' thrust, as in Vertical and/or Short Take-Off (V/STO-). Each method has advantages and disadvantages of its own: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} 2008 design envisaged flying F-35B Lightning II Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) jets from a ski-jump ramp. However, in May 2010, {{the government}} {{decided it would}} acquire the Catapult <b>Assisted</b> <b>Take-Off</b> But Arrested Recovery (CATOBAR) variant, the F-35C, and convert Prince of Wales to a CATOBAR configuration.|$|E
50|$|STOBAR is {{a system}} used for the launch and {{recovery}} of aircraft from the deck of an aircraft carrier, combining elements of both STOVL and CATOBAR. Aircraft launch under their own power using a ski-jump to <b>assist</b> <b>take-off</b> (rather than using a catapult). These are conventional aircraft however and require arresting wires {{to land on the}} ship. The Russian Navy aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov operated the Su-33, in this manner. Others include the Indian Vikramaditya and the future Vikrant class aircraft carrier; both will operate MiG-29Ks.|$|R
5|$|A second I-215 {{was built}} to an order from OKB-1 as the I-215D (dooblyor, second prototype), to {{evaluate}} the bicycle or tandem landing gear configuration. It used wider-diameter paired wheels in a tandem arrangement that retracted into the fuselage, along with small outrigger wheels under the engine nacelles which retracted into fairings. The main undercarriage of the I-215D also incorporated a kneeling feature which could increase the incidence of the aircraft by 3° to <b>assist</b> <b>take-off.</b> Trials with this undercarriage arrangement were successful and {{paved the way for}} its use in other Soviet aircraft, including Dr. Brunolf Baade's Aircraft 150, then under development.|$|R
5000|$|The Sprite was a British {{rocket engine}} built by de Havilland {{for use in}} RATO (Rocket-assisted take off) applications. For RATO use only a short burn time is required, with {{simplicity}} and light weight as major virtues. The intended market was for <b>assisting</b> <b>take-off</b> of de Havilland Comet 1 airliners (as hot and high operations in the British Empire were considered important) and also for V bombers carrying heavy nuclear weapons. [...] 30 successful test flights were carried out by Comets, from May 1951, but gas turbine performance improved rapidly, and so RATO was not required in service.|$|R
50|$|Hypergolic {{propellants}} {{were discovered}} independently, {{for the third}} time, in the U.S. by GALCIT and Navy Annapolis researchers in 1940. They developed engines powered by aniline and nitric acid. Robert Goddard, Reaction Motors and Curtiss-Wright worked on aniline/nitric acid engines in the early 1940s, for small missiles and jet <b>assisted</b> <b>take-off</b> (JATO).|$|E
50|$|JATO (acronym for jet-assisted take-off), {{is a type}} of <b>assisted</b> <b>take-off</b> {{for helping}} {{overloaded}} aircraft into the air by providing additional thrust in the form of small rockets. The term JATO is used interchangeably with the (more specific) term RATO, for rocket-assisted take-off (or, in RAF parlance, RATOG for rocket-assisted take-off gear).|$|E
50|$|CH-2 {{is second}} member of Rainbow (CH) series UAV {{and it is}} a {{development}} of earlier CH-1, with identical twin-boom layout. As with its predecessor CH-1, propulsion of CH-2 is also provided by a two-blade propeller driven by a pusher engine mounted at the rear end of the fuselage, and the UAV is launched via vehicle mounted catapult with rocketed <b>assisted</b> <b>take-off.</b> CH-2 is mainly intended for reconnaissance and surveillance missions.|$|E
50|$|After {{testing the}} first {{production}} aircraft were fitted with the improved undercarriage and two rocket units. These may have <b>assisted</b> with <b>take-off</b> or {{may have been}} designed for the final acceleration towards the target.|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{extension}} of a previous effort by the Principal Investigator to develop baseline data to support comparative analysis of Highly Reusable Space Transportation (HRST) concepts. The analyses presented herin develop baseline data bases for two two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) concepts: (1) <b>Assisted</b> horizontal <b>take-off</b> all rocket (<b>assisted</b> HTOHL); and (2) <b>Assisted</b> vertical <b>take-off</b> rocket based combined cycle (RBCC). The study objectives were to: (1) Provide configuration definitions and illustrations for assisted HTOHL and assisted RBCC; (2) Develop a rationalization approach and compare these concepts with the HRST reference; and (3) Analyze TSTO configurations which try to maintain SSTO benefits while reducing inert weight sensitivity...|$|R
50|$|During the 1960s, further {{development}} work was undertaken, with the School of Fighter Direction {{returning to the}} site and the Sea Venoms being replaced by the de Havilland Sea Vixens then in turn by the McDonnell-Douglas Phantom FG1 as a carrier-borne fighter. The 1970s saw the Flag Officer, Naval Air Command (FONAC), transferring from RNAS Lee-on-Solent. Royal Navy fixed wing operations were phased out, and the Phantoms transferred to the RAF. The base remained {{as the home of}} the Commando Helicopter Squadrons, using the Wessex HU5 and later the Sea King HC4, and the fixed wing Fleet Requirements and Aircraft Direction Unit (FRADU) and became the main shore base for the Navy's fleet of Sea Harrier FRS1 (and later, FA2). A ski-jump (now removed) was installed to enable practice of ski-jump <b>assisted</b> <b>take-offs.</b>|$|R

50|$|Catapult <b>assisted</b> <b>take-off</b> but arrested {{recovery}} (CATOBAR): A steam-powered catapult {{is connected}} to the aircraft, and is used to accelerate conventional aircraft to a safe flying speed. By the end of the catapult stroke, the aircraft is airborne and further propulsion is provided by its own engines. This is the most expensive method as it requires complex machinery to be installed under the flight deck, but allows for even heavily loaded aircraft to take off.|$|E
50|$|The Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II is {{a family}} of single-seat, single-engine, {{all-weather}} stealth multirole fighters. The fifth-generation combat aircraft is designed to perform ground attack and air superiority missions. It has three main models: the F-35A conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) variant, the F-35B short take-off and vertical-landing (STOVL) variant, and the F-35C carrier-based Catapult <b>Assisted</b> <b>Take-Off</b> But Arrested Recovery (CATOBAR) variant. On 31 July 2015, the United States Marines declared ready for deployment the first squadron of F-35B fighters after intensive testing. On 2 August 2016, the U.S. Air Force declared its first squadron of F-35A fighters combat-ready.|$|E
50|$|In 1939, {{researchers}} at the California Institute of Technology seeking to develop a high performance solid rocket motor to <b>assist</b> aircraft <b>take-off,</b> combined black powder with common road asphalt to produce the first true composite motor. This was {{the birth of the}} true composite motor and marked the end of the use of black powder in major rocketry applications.|$|R
50|$|Germany {{had very}} active rocket {{development}} {{before and during}} World War II, both for the strategic V-2 rocket and other missiles. The V-2 used an alcohol/LOX liquid propellant engine, with hydrogen peroxide to drive the fuel pumps. The alcohol was mixed with water for engine cooling. Both Germany and the United States developed reusable liquid propellant rocket engines that used a storeable liquid oxidizer with much greater density than LOX and a liquid fuel that would ignite spontaneously on contact with the high density oxidizer. The German engine was powered by hydrogen peroxide and a fuel mixture of hydrazine hydrate and methyl alcohol. The U.S. engine was powered by nitric acid oxidizer and aniline. Both engines were used to power aircraft, the Me-163B Komet interceptor {{in the case of}} the German engine and RATO units to <b>assist</b> <b>take-off</b> of aircraft {{in the case of the}} U.S. engine.|$|R
2500|$|In {{parallel}} with the guided missile programme in Nazi Germany, rockets were also used on aircraft, either for <b>assisting</b> horizontal <b>take-off</b> (RATO), vertical take-off (Bachem Ba 349 [...] "Natter") or for powering them (Me 163, etc.). During the war Germany also developed several guided and unguided air-to-air, ground-to-air and ground-to-ground missiles (see list of World War II guided missiles of Germany).|$|R
50|$|Silver Eagle is {{launched}} from a 6 x 6 truck, {{which is both}} the launching platform and transportation vehicle, and the UAV utilizes rocket <b>assisted</b> <b>take-off.</b> Presumably, there {{would be at least}} another vehicle housing the ground control station. Very little information has been publicized by the official Chinese government sources, which only reveal (as of 2014) that Silver Eagle is a shore-based naval UAV. There are postulates that Silver Eagle can either act as a communication relay or electronic intelligence gathering platform, or as an aerial jamming platform, but such claims have yet to be confirmed.|$|E
5000|$|A ramjet, {{sometimes}} referred to as a flying stovepipe or an athodyd (an abbreviation of aero thermodynamic duct), is a form of airbreathing jet engine that uses the engine's forward motion to compress incoming air without an axial compressor. Because ramjets cannot produce thrust at zero airspeed, they cannot move an aircraft from a standstill. A ramjet-powered vehicle, therefore, requires an <b>assisted</b> <b>take-off</b> like a rocket assist to accelerate it to a speed where it begins to produce thrust. Ramjets work most efficiently at supersonic speeds around [...] This type of engine can operate up to speeds of [...]|$|E
50|$|The Potez 42 {{differed}} {{most obviously}} from the Hanriot and the Guillemin {{in having a}} low wing. This <b>assisted</b> <b>take-off</b> and landing performance, important for short, rough strip operation but required the patient's compartment to be well behind the centre of gravity for easy access, making trimming more difficult. The cantilever wing was in three parts, with a short (3.0 m) centre-section and long outer panels. Strongly straight tapered in plan, though with very little sweep on the leading edge, it had a high aspect ratio (8.2); the tips were semi-elliptical. High aspect ratio ailerons occupied about half the span. The wings were built around two spruce spars.|$|E

The Allies' rocket programs were [...] less sophisticated, relying mostly on unguided missiles like the Soviet Katyusha rocket.|$|R

50|$|The 109-500 is a self-contained. modular {{monopropellant}} Starthilfe (<b>take-off</b> <b>assist)</b> motor in a pod, able {{to produce}} 500 kg thrust for thirty seconds. After the fuel was expended, the pod was jettisoned and it returned to earth by parachute, with the parachute packed externally, onto the blunt forward end of the pod.|$|R
