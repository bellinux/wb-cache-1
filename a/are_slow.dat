5|$|Propagation is by seed, {{though these}} can be {{difficult}} to extract from the follicles. Seeds do not require any treatment before sowing, and take 12 to 48 days to germinate. Cultivars require propagation by cutting for progeny to grow true. Cuttings <b>are</b> <b>slow</b> to strike. Attempts to graft B.coccinea have met with little success.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{is divided into}} a number of sections depending on altitude. The densest part of the atmosphere, the troposphere, begins at the surface and extends upwards to 65km. At the furnace-like surface the winds <b>are</b> <b>slow,</b> but {{at the top of the}} troposphere the temperature and pressure reaches Earth-like levels and clouds pick up speed to 100m/s.|$|E

5|$|Nickel is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ni and atomic number 28. It is a silvery-white lustrous metal {{with a slight}} golden tinge. Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile. Pure nickel, powdered to maximize the reactive surface area, shows a significant chemical activity, but larger pieces <b>are</b> <b>slow</b> to react with air under standard conditions because an oxide layer forms {{on the surface and}} prevents further corrosion (passivation). Even so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the interiors of larger nickel–iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Thermal inertia and the {{transfer}} of heat by winds in the lower atmosphere mean that the temperature of Venus's surface does not vary significantly between the night and day sides, despite Venus's extremely slow rotation. Winds at the surface <b>are</b> <b>slow,</b> moving at a few kilometres per hour, {{but because of the}} high density of the atmosphere at the surface, they exert a significant amount of force against obstructions, and transport dust and small stones across the surface. This alone would make it difficult for a human to walk through, even if the heat, pressure, and lack of oxygen were not a problem.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not known}} if C.tuberosa is {{strictly}} parasitic, and needs the host to be living, {{or whether it is}} saprobic. Either way, the fruit bodies of the fungus are found growing solitarily or in dense clusters on the decomposing, often blackened remains of other mushrooms. Hosts include agarics (particularly Lactarius and Russula), boletes, hydnums, and polypores. In the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, Russula crassotunicata is a common and abundant species that has been definitively identified as a host of both C.tuberosa and Dendrocollybia racemosa. The Russula fruit bodies <b>are</b> <b>slow</b> to decay, and are available nearly year-round as a substrate for the saprobes. Based on field observations, the authors suggest that C.tuberosa may produce fruit bodies on less decayed mushrooms, while D.racemosa produces them on much more heavily decayed mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|Like all Lactarius species, L.argillaceifolius is mycorrhizal. The fruit {{bodies of}} Lactarius argillaceifolius grow {{scattered}} or in {{groups on the}} ground under hardwoods, especially oak, from July to October. It is often {{one of the first}} mycorrhizal mushrooms to fruit in forests dominated by oak and hickory. The fruit bodies <b>are</b> <b>slow</b> to develop and are long-lasting. The species is found from eastern Canada south to Florida, and west to Minnesota and Texas. It is common in northeast Mexico. The mushroom has also been reported from southern Brazil (state of Santa Catarina) growing in association with pine (Pinus elliottii) plantations, where it has probably been introduced with pine seedlings brought by settlers. L.argillaceifolius var. megacarpus has been collected from Baja California, California, Oregon, and Washington, where it grows in association with coast live oak and tanoak.|$|E
5|$|Loggerhead {{sea turtles}} {{observed}} in captivity {{and in the}} wild are most active during the day. In captivity, the loggerheads' daily activities are divided between swimming and resting on the bottom. While resting, they spread their forelimbs to about midstroke swimming position. They remain motionless with eyes open or half-shut and are easily alerted during this state. At night, captives sleep {{in the same position}} with their eyes tightly shut, and <b>are</b> <b>slow</b> to react. Loggerheads spend up to 85% of their day submerged, with males being the more active divers than females. The average duration of dives is 15–30 min, but they can stay submerged for up to four hours. Juvenile loggerheads and adults differ in their swimming methods. A juvenile keeps its forelimbs pressed to the side of its carapace, and propels itself by kicking with its hind limbs. As the juvenile matures, its swimming method is progressively replaced with the adult's alternating-limb method. They depend entirely on this method of swimming by one year old.|$|E

5|$|Marine mammals were hunted by coastal {{aboriginal}} humans historically {{for food}} and other resources. These subsistence hunts still occur in Canada, Greenland, Indonesia, Russia, the United States, and several nations in the Caribbean. The effects of these are only localized, as hunting efforts were on a relatively small scale. Commercial hunting took this to a much greater scale and marine mammals were heavily exploited. This led to the extinction of the †Steller's sea cow (along with subsistence hunting) and the †Caribbean monk seal. Today, populations of species that were historically hunted, such as blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) and the North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica), are much lower than their pre-whaling levels. Because whales generally have slow growth rates, <b>are</b> <b>slow</b> to reach sexual maturity, and have a low reproductive output, population recovery has been very slow.|$|E
5|$|The AWS has {{a mind of}} its own {{at times}} and reaches peak {{performance}} with the owner who is dedicated to teaching the dog just what is expected of it. The breed takes well to training, and especially excels at training that offers some variety rather than routine training drills. However, members of the breed can may have issues with food possessiveness. They can be stubborn, and mentally <b>are</b> <b>slow</b> to mature from puppyhood. Some lines of the breed still retain dominant and aggressive temperaments; other than these lines, the AWS gets on well with children and enjoys playing with them. Even though they were originally bred to hunt, due to their size, they are suitable for apartment living as long as they receive enough exercise.|$|E
5|$|The Oakridge {{students}} are placed into learning groups named after animals. Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) initially suspects her daughter Juanita (Madison De La Garza), {{who is in}} the Leopards, is among the slow group, whereas Susan (Teri Hatcher) is pleased that her son M.J. (Mason Vale Cotton) is in the Giraffes, which she believes are advanced. This leads to competitive behavior between the two ladies. Eventually, by taking pictures of different students' homework and studying them, Gabrielle realizes the Leopards are actually advanced and the Giraffes <b>are</b> <b>slow.</b> When Susan realizes this, she confronts a teacher in public, and the secret code of the animal groups becomes widespread. While Susan and Gabrielle wait to talk to the principal, they both admit they got carried away and confess fears that they are letting their kids down.|$|E

5|$|The {{nestling}} period also {{varies by}} species size, with larger species having longer nestling periods. It is also affected by season {{and environmental factors}} and by competition with siblings in species with clutch sizes greater than one. Much {{of what is known}} about the nestling period of some species is dependent on aviary studies– aviary cockatiels can fledge after 5weeks and the large palm cockatoos after 11weeks. During this period, the young become covered in juvenile plumage while remaining in the hollow. Wings and tail feathers <b>are</b> <b>slow</b> to grow initially but more rapid as the primary feathers appear. Nestlings quickly reach about 80–90% of adult weight about two thirds of the time through this period, plateauing before they leave the hollow; they fledge at this weight with wing and tail feathers still to grow a little before reaching adult dimensions. Growth rate of the young, as well as numbers fledged, are adversely impacted by reduced food supply and poor weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins in}} its {{principal}} setting with Swift and two backup musicians atop {{a stage in}} a crowded barn. Swift {{is dressed in a}} fitted pastel sundress and plays an acoustic guitar strapped over her shoulder. The backup musicians play the fiddle,the piano, the drum set, and the upright bass. The video then transitions to a clip from Hannah Montana: The Movie in which Miley Stewart (Cyrus) spots her love interest, Travis Brody (Lucas Till), riding a brown horse. The video alternates between Swift performing and more film clips. Other scenes include Stewart and Brody riding the brown horse together, Stewart staring out from a red car into the street, Brody swinging from a rope in a waterfall, and the two characters on a date. At the end of the video, the couple <b>are</b> <b>slow</b> dancing while Swift sings.|$|E
5|$|The North of England pioneered rail transport. Milestones {{include the}} 1758 Middleton Railway in Leeds, the first railway {{authorised}} by Act of Parliament {{and the oldest}} continually operating in the world; the 1825 Stockton and Darlington Railway, the first public railway to use steam locomotives; and the 1830 Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the first modern main line. Today the region retains many of its original railway lines, including the East Coast and West Coast main lines and the Cross Country Route. Passenger numbers on Northern routes increased over 50% between 2004 and 2016, and Northern England handles over half of total UK rail freight, but infrastructure is poorly funded compared to Southern railways: railways in London received £5426 per resident in 2015 while those in the North East received just £223 per resident, and journeys between major cities <b>are</b> <b>slow</b> and overcrowded. To combat this, the Department of Transport has devolved many of its powers to Rail North, an alliance of local authorities from the Scottish Borders down to Staffordshire which manages the Northern Rail and TransPennine Express franchises that operate many routes in Northern England. Meanwhile, new build such as the Northern Hub around Manchester, High Speed 2 from Manchester and Leeds to London and High Speed 3 from Liverpool to Hull and Newcastle is planned to increase capacity on important Northern routes and decrease travel times.|$|E
