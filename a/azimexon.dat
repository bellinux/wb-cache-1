40|$|ABSTRACT-Effects {{produced}} by long-term application of three immune modifiers (<b>azimexon,</b> retinoic acid, and tuftsin) on the depressed immune systems of 18 -month-old inbred C 57 BU 6 female mice were investigated. The effect of each agent was examined on four cell types (cytotoxic T-cells, K-cells, NK cells, and macrophages) possibly involved in antitumor defenses {{and on the}} spontaneous tumor development that accompanied ad-vancing age. Three substances chosen for this study appeared able to alter immune parameters, and each one displayed its own pattern of activity. Common to all three agents were an increase of age-depressed tumoricidal activity of peritoneal macrophages and {{no effect on the}} depressed NK activity of spleen cells. Retinoic acid increased splenic K-cell activity, already elevated in aged mice and unaffected by the other two agents. Cytotoxic T-cell activity, diminished by age, was stimulated considerably b...|$|E
40|$|The {{first part}} of this paper focuses on the {{secondary}} immunodeficiencies caused by immunosuppressive drugs and environmental chemicals. The mechanism of action and the therapeutic effects of azathioprine, glucocorticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporin A, and anticancer drugs will be discussed. The im-munotoxic actions of benzene, polychlorinated and polybrominated biphenyls, tetrachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, various insecticides, metals and abused drugs or drugs with side effects are also described. Immunorestorative approaches are discussed in the second part, based on our current knowledge of the immune system and the lymphokines and hormones involved in its function. The usefulness of thymic hormones, interleukin 2, macrophage growth factorkolony stimulating factor, and interferons as immunotherapeutic agents is considered. In addition, we address chemically defined drugs, such as levamisole, diethyldithiocarbamate, isoprinosine, muramyl dipeptides, <b>azimexon,</b> ciamexon, bestatin, tuftsin, and pyrimidinoles, and finally conclude that combined use of different immunostimulants may be {{the most effective way to}} treat the above mentioned immunodeficiencies.
