5|$|During the pouring rain, a {{young boy}} helps {{his mother and father}} leave a heavily chained toy box at the {{doorstep}} of Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends with instructions to not be opened. The next day, Frankie has grown outraged about her job as the house caretaker; Mr. Herriman has been giving her endless chores to take care day after day without thanking her for any of it. When Frankie discovers the box left on the doorstep, Herriman instructs her to leave it in the attic. In a fit of <b>anger</b> <b>toward</b> Herriman, she intentionally ignores the instructions given in the box and peeks inside it. She falls inside, only to discover it is a vast world filled with anthropomorphic toys and delectable treats. She hears and sympathizes with {{a young boy}}'s voice (Max Burkholder), later revealed to be the imaginary friend named World (given the name by the crew of the show), who has been living alone in the toy chest since his family left the box at Foster's.|$|E
5|$|Piso {{was rumored}} to have been {{responsible}} for his death and with accusations coming in it wasn't long before the well known accuser, Lucius Fulcinius Trio, brought charges against him. The Pisones were longtime supporters of the Claudians, and had allied themselves with Octavian early on. The continued support of the Pisones and his own friendship to Piso made him hesitant to hear the case himself. After briefly hearing both sides, Tiberius deferred the case to the Senate, making no effort to hide his deep <b>anger</b> <b>toward</b> Piso. Tiberius made allowances for Piso to summon witnesses of all social orders, including slaves, and he was given more time to plea than the prosecutors, but it made no difference: before the trial was over Piso died ostensibly by suicide, but Tacitus supposes Tiberius may have had him murdered before he could implicate the emperor in Germanicus' death.|$|E
50|$|Robert C. Solomon places {{contempt}} on {{the same}} continuum as resentment and anger, and {{he argues that the}} differences between the three are that resentment is <b>anger</b> directed <b>toward</b> a higher-status individual; <b>anger</b> is directed <b>toward</b> an equal-status individual; and contempt is <b>anger</b> directed <b>toward</b> a lower-status individual.|$|R

5|$|The new work, {{like its}} predecessor, {{attracted}} minimal readership. On 21 June 1791, {{just days after}} it was published, all attention became focused on King Louis XVI's ill-fated flight to Varennes, and Saint-Just's theories about constitutional monarchy were made suddenly irrelevant. Yet the episode had another effect – it fostered a public <b>anger</b> <b>toward</b> the king which simmered all year until finally a Parisian mob attacked the Tuileries Palace on 10 August 1792. In response, the Assembly declared itself ready to step down ahead of schedule {{and called for a}} new election, this one under universal male suffrage. The timing was excellent for Saint-Just, who turned the legal age of twenty-five {{before the end of the}} month. The fear inspired by the invasion of the Tuileries made most of his opponents retire from the scene, and Saint-Just was elected as one of the deputies for the département of Aisne. He left for Paris to join the National Convention as its youngest member.|$|E
5|$|In March 1955, Richard was {{suspended}} {{for the remainder of}} the season, including the playoffs, after he received a match penalty for slashing Boston's Hal Laycoe and subsequently punching a linesman who intervened. The suspension touched off a wave of <b>anger</b> <b>toward</b> league president Clarence Campbell, who was warned not to attend a scheduled game in Montreal after receiving numerous death threats, mainly from French-Canadians accusing him of anti-French bias. Campbell dismissed the warnings, and attended the March 17 game as planned. His presence at the game was perceived by many fans as a provocation and he was booed and pelted with eggs and fruit. An hour into the game, a fan lobbed a tear-gas bomb in Campbell's direction, causing fire officials to clear the building. Fans leaving the Forum were met by a growing mob of angry demonstrators who overwhelmed the 250 police officers on the scene and rioted outside of the Forum. Seventy people were arrested, 37 people injured, 50 stores were looted and $100,000 in property damage was reported as a result of the melee, which became known as , or the Richard Riot. The incident highlighted the growing cultural gap between French Quebec and English Canada and the riot is often described as an early manifestation of Quebec's Quiet Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris {{learns that}} his best customer, Herbert, has made Kyle, a neighbor's {{son and a}} bully, his new paper boy. Chris decides to confront them both but ends up getting pushed over by Kyle and laughed at by Kyle's friends {{subsequently}} returning home in tears much to Peter and Lois' concern. Peter goes to talk with Kyle who makes fun of him over and over. Unable to control his <b>anger</b> <b>toward</b> Kyle, Peter beats him up leaving Kyle bleeding and bruised. Kyle’s mother agrees not to press charges if Peter apologizes to Kyle which he reluctantly does. Kyle comments on how good bullying makes you feel which encourages Peter to become a bully. Peter splashes a {{pot of boiling water}} over Lois and makes her punch herself in the face. He also hits Stewie on his sunburned buttocks, knocks Chris out of his chair, and sticks his large butt out at Meg to fart repeatedly in her face following her backwards around the kitchen table until she finally trips and vomits on the floor at which Peter gets mad with her. When Peter also bullies his friends, such as using Joe as a marionette and pulling Cleveland's pants down, Lois points out that he is as bad as his old school bully, Randy Fulcher. Deciding he should bully him instead, Peter finds Randy who is now suffering from multiple sclerosis. Thinking, when Randy says “I have MS,” that he is bragging that he has a monkey’s scrotum, Peter is about to beat up Randy but is stopped by Chris who beats Peter up instead and finally convinces him bullying is wrong. As the event is witnessed by a wrong sounding Kermit the Frog and a wrong sounding Swedish Chef, a wrong sounding Fozzie Bear (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) asks them if they want to hear a joke as the episode ends.|$|E
40|$|Subjects were angered or not angered {{during a}} bogus {{experimental}} task following which their assistance was solicited. Consistent with derivations from Pawling's concept of Anticipatory Guilt, {{the results indicated}} that anger facilitated helping only when the lone bystander's <b>anger</b> was directed <b>toward</b> the victim of an emergency. However, anger tended to inhibit helping when: (1) <b>anger</b> was directed <b>toward</b> someone other than the victim of an emergency; (2) <b>anger</b> was directed <b>toward</b> the solicitor of a mere favor; and (3) the angered bystander was {{in the presence of a}} non-angered negativa model while the anger instigating victim was in need of emergency assistance.

She was subjected to criticism throughout the community for not reporting anything about Anjelica's disappearance.|$|E
25|$|At 4:58 pm, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley held a {{news conference}} to discuss the {{verdicts}} handed down for the four LAPD police officers. Incensed, his statement showed both <b>anger</b> <b>toward</b> the verdicts and made an appeal for calm. Assistant Los Angeles police chief Bob Vernon believed Bradley's opening remarks invited a riot, and were perhaps taken as a signal by some citizens to act in violence. Vernon backed this statement with the assertion that the number of police incidents rose in the hour after the mayor's press conference.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} of the myth of Prometheus in Prometheus Bound is {{a radical departure from}} the earlier accounts found in Hesiod's Theogony (511-616) and Works and Days (42-105). Hesiod essentially portrays the Titan as a lowly trickster and semi-comic foil to Zeus's authority. Zeus's <b>anger</b> <b>toward</b> Prometheus is in turn responsible for mortal man's having to provide for himself; before, all of man's needs had been provided by the gods. Prometheus' theft of fire also prompts the arrival of the first woman, Pandora, and her jar of evils. Pandora is entirely absent from Prometheus Bound, and Prometheus becomes a human benefactor and divine king-maker, rather than an object of blame for human suffering.|$|E
5000|$|All {{three of}} the young women protagonists in the story express [...] "extreme <b>anger</b> and hatred <b>toward</b> their enemies," [...] {{according}} to Lu Xing's analysis, along with [...] "a fierce determination to join the revolutionary force."

5000|$|Ancient Greek philosophers, {{describing}} and {{commenting on}} the uncontrolled <b>anger,</b> particularly <b>toward</b> slaves, in their society generally showed a hostile attitude towards anger. Galen and Seneca regarded anger {{as a kind of}} madness. They all rejected the spontaneous, uncontrolled fits of anger and agreed on both the possibility and value of controlling anger. There were however disagreements regarding the value of anger. For Seneca, anger was [...] "worthless even for war." [...] Seneca believed that the disciplined Roman army was regularly able to beat the Germans, who were known for their fury. He argued that [...] "... in sporting contests, {{it is a mistake to}} become angry".|$|R
5000|$|His funeral is {{attended}} by most everyone who cares for Bianca, and their [...] "eulogies" [...] are laced with <b>anger</b> and hatred <b>toward</b> him. Lena even {{goes so far}} as to spit on his grave.

25|$|The first federal safety {{legislation}} was enacted in the Progressive period. In 1893, Congress passed the Safety Appliance Act, {{the first federal}} statute to require safety equipment in the workplace (the law applied only to railroad equipment, however). In 1910, {{in response to a}} series of highly publicized and deadly mine explosions and collapses, Congress established the United States Bureau of Mines to conduct research into mine safety (although the Bureau had no authority to regulate mine safety). Backed by trade unions, many states also enacted workers' compensation laws which discouraged employers from permitting unsafe workplaces. These laws, as well as the growing power of labor unions and public <b>anger</b> <b>toward</b> poor workplace safety, led to significant reductions in worker accidents for a time.|$|E
25|$|On 4 February 1905, Grand Duke Sergei, who had {{recently}} resigned from the post of Governor General of Moscow, was assassinated by Ivan Kalyaev, {{a member of the}} Socialist-Revolutionary Party. Kalyaev, armed with a homemade bomb, had aborted his first attempt to kill the Grand Duke when he spotted Dmitri and Marie with their uncle in his carriage. His uncle's death was only one of several assassinations that robbed Dmitri of close family members. After Sergei's death, Grand Duchess Elizabeth undertook to raise her niece and nephew on her own, thus making them part of a rare female-headed household. Maria Pavlovna continued to have some feelings of <b>anger</b> <b>toward</b> her aunt, whom she would blame for her overly hasty marriage to Prince William of Sweden in 1908, but Dmitri formed a very strong bond with Elizabeth and came to admire her personal fortitude.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, tension {{continued}} to build within the Mega Powers, and on The Main Event, aired on live television on February 3, 1989, From the Bradley Center in Milwaukee, WI., Savage {{could no longer}} contain his growing <b>anger</b> <b>toward</b> Hogan. The sequence of events began when Akeem threw Savage onto Elizabeth, who was knocked unconscious from {{the force of the}} blow. Hogan immediately ran to Elizabeth's aid and, distraught and fearing the worst, carried her to the backstage area for medical attention; the match continued in the meantime, with Akeem and Big Bossman working Savage over. Elizabeth eventually regained consciousness and asked Hogan to return to the ring. However, Savage, furious over being left to take a beating, slapped Hogan in the face and, after having some choice words, left him to face the Twin Towers alone. (Hogan eventually won the match single handed). Following the match backstage, Savage and Hogan had a loud verbal argument while Elizabeth was receiving medical attention, which culminated with Savage blindsiding Hogan with the championship belt and beating him.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} {{research}} we test the unreasoning disgust hypothesis: moral disgust, in particular {{in response to a}} violation of a bodily norm, is less likely than moral anger to be justified with cognitively elaborated reasons. In experiment 1, participants were asked to explain why they felt <b>anger</b> and disgust <b>toward</b> pedophiles. Participants were more likely to invoke elaborated reasons, versus merely evaluative responses, when explaining their anger, versus disgust. Experiment 2 used a between-participants design; participants explained why they felt either <b>anger</b> or disgust <b>toward</b> seven groups that either violated a sexual or non-sexual norm. Again, elaborated reasons were less prevalent when explaining their disgust versus anger, and in particular when explaining disgust toward a group that violated a sexual norm. Experiment 3 further established that these findings are due to a lower accessibility of elaborated reasons for bodily disgust, rather than inhibition in using them when provided. From these findings it can be concluded that communicating external reasons for moral disgust at bodily violations is made more difficult due to the unavailability of those reasons to people. ...|$|R
3000|$|Happiness was an {{interesting}} case, as only one participant demonstrated prototypical [...] "jumping for joy". Another participant danced, another one made gestures to the sky in thankfulness, and the last shook her arms to the side in excitement while running in place. Interestingly, the dancing portrayal was the most well recognized by raters, not [...] "jumping for joy", which was sometimes mistaken for <b>anger.</b> The gestures <b>toward</b> the sky were often perceived as grief or sadness.|$|R
50|$|In {{the version}} cited by Livy, the gods {{themselves}} were suggested to have intervened. He retells one variant wherein {{the emotions of}} the public were assuaged {{not only by the}} oath of Proculus Julius to have seen the deified king, but also by an apparently divine force that quieted the <b>anger</b> and suspicions <b>toward</b> the nobles. It descended upon the city and the Romans accepted and worshiped Romulus as Quirinus. Romulus was 54 years old when he disappeared.|$|R

500|$|In 1960, Howard {{broke from}} Cardell. He {{subsequently}} divorced his wife, with Mary Cardell providing evidence against Howard in the divorce proceedings, something which possibly exacerbated Howard's <b>anger</b> <b>toward</b> his former employers. In 1961 he invited a journalist, William Hall of the London Evening News, {{to spy on}} a nocturnal Witchcraft ritual that the Cardells were performing in the woods around their home; Hall subsequently published an expose, [...] "Witchcraft in the Woods", in March 1961. The Cardells subsequently took the newspaper to court, accusing them of libel, during which they claimed that Howard was pathologically dishonest. Several weeks later, Howard received a mirror accompanied by an effigy that had been pierced in the post, and Cardell was summoned to court accused of sending it.|$|E

500|$|As many as 390,000 ethnic Chinese, {{two-thirds of}} those with {{rightful}} claims to Indonesian citizenship renounced their Chinese status when the treaty came into effect in 1962. On the other hand, an estimated 60,000 ethnic Chinese students left for the People's Republic of China in the 1950s and early 1960s. The first wave of students were almost entirely educated in Chinese-language schools, but {{were not able to}} find opportunities for tertiary education in Indonesia. Seeking quality scientific professions, they entered China with high hopes for their future and that of the mainland. Subsequent migrations occurred in 1960 as part of a repatriation program and in 1965–1966 following a series of anti-communist violence that also drew <b>anger</b> <b>toward</b> the ethnic Chinese. As many as 80 percent of the original students who entered the mainland eventually became refugees in Hong Kong. Under the programs of China's Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), the returned overseas Chinese were questioned for their loyalty because of their foreign connections. As most had grown up in an urban environment they were sent to the countryside, told to [...] "rebel against their own class background", and eventually lost contact with their families. They were attacked as [...] "imperialists", [...] "capitalists", [...] "spies", [...] "half-breeds", and [...] "foreign devils".|$|E
500|$|McKenzie {{wrote that}} Tripp only {{partially}} succeeded in {{his goal of}} describing homosexuality, that his bibliography omitted basic works and included some dubious sources, and that while some of Tripp's observations were thought-provoking, others were ludicrous. He also described the book as a rambling, awkwardly written, and poorly organized anecdotal survey. Hendin called The Homosexual Matrix pseudoscience and Tripp an [...] "erudite con man" [...] who lacked impartiality and had a [...] "bias toward homosexuality". Hendin argued that Tripp saw homosexuality as superior to heterosexuality and sexual passion as dependent upon anger, mistakenly drew conclusions about heterosexuality from observations about homosexual behavior, and had a distorted view of sexual history and a negative view of women. Hendin wrote that Tripp's conclusion that homosexuality {{is not related to}} fear or <b>anger</b> <b>toward</b> women, family relationships, or a reflection of confusion over sexual identity, was baseless. His review was followed by letters of protest from the historian Martin Duberman, Pomeroy, Weinberg, and others, to which Hendin replied with a rebuttal. Cameron called Tripp [...] "vulgar" [...] and prejudiced and characterizing Tripp's evidence as [...] "largely literary." [...] Cameron criticized Tripp for treating the Kinsey Reports as authoritative, writing that they had been [...] "critically studied for almost thirty years" [...] and were out of date, for being careless in his discussion of history, and for focusing mainly on male homosexuality and neglecting lesbianism. Cameron was convinced by Tripp's argument that strains and tensions are necessary in a relationship to keep the partners interested in each other, and found his discussion of psychotherapy insightful.|$|E

50|$|Self-compassion has {{different}} effects than self-esteem, a subjective emotional {{evaluation of the}} self.
