5|$|The facades of English cathedrals show a {{considerable}} diversity, {{rather than a}} consistent progression, {{as is the case}} in Northern France and other cathedrals influenced by the French Gothic style. In many cases, regardless of the <b>architectural</b> <b>form,</b> the English façade was treated as a decorative screen with many niches occupied by statues. A great number of these were toppled or defaced during the 17th century, however a “Gallery of Kings” remains high on the façade of Lincoln, and many of the original weather-worn figures remain at Exeter.|$|E
5|$|Triadic pyramids first {{appeared}} in the Preclassic. They consisted of a dominant structure flanked by two smaller inward-facing buildings, all mounted upon a single basal platform. The largest known triadic pyramid was built at El Mirador in the Petén Basin; it covers an area six times as large as that covered by Temple IV, the largest pyramid at Tikal. The three superstructures all have stairways leading up from the central plaza on top of the basal platform. No securely established forerunners of Triadic Groups are known, but they may have developed from the eastern range building of E-Group complexes. The triadic form was the predominant <b>architectural</b> <b>form</b> in the Petén region during the Late Preclassic. Examples of triadic pyramids are known from as many as 88 archaeological sites. At Nakbe, there are at least a dozen examples of triadic complexes and the four largest structures in the city are triadic in nature. At El Mirador there are probably as many as 36 triadic structures. Examples of the triadic form are even known from Dzibilchaltun in the far north of the Yucatán Peninsula, and Q'umarkaj in the Highlands of Guatemala. The triadic pyramid remained a popular <b>architectural</b> <b>form</b> for centuries after the first examples were built; it continued in use into the Classic Period, with later examples being found at Uaxactun, Caracol, Seibal, Nakum, Tikal and Palenque. The Q'umarkaj example {{is the only one that}} has been dated to the Postclassic Period. The triple-temple form of the triadic pyramid appears to be related to Maya mythology.|$|E
5|$|In 1485 Ivan III {{commissioned}} {{the building of}} the royal residence, Terem Palace, within the Kremlin, with Aloisio da Milano as the architect of the first three floors. He and other Italian architects also contributed to the construction of the Kremlin walls and towers. The small banquet hall of the Russian Tsars, called the Palace of Facets because of its facetted upper story, is the work of two Italians, Marco Ruffo and Pietro Solario, and shows a more Italian style. In 1505, an Italian known in Russia as Aleviz Novyi or Aleviz Fryazin arrived in Moscow. He may have been the Venetian sculptor, Alevisio Lamberti da Montagne. He built 12 churches for Ivan III, including the Cathedral of the Archangel, a building remarkable for the successful blending of Russian tradition, Orthodox requirements and Renaissance style. It is believed that the Cathedral of the Metropolitan Peter in Vysokopetrovsky Monastery, another work of Aleviz Novyi, later served as an inspiration for the so-called octagon-on-tetragon <b>architectural</b> <b>form</b> in the Moscow Baroque of the late 17th century.|$|E

25|$|Usko Nystöm {{established}} a joint <b>architectural</b> <b>form</b> with Albert Petrelius (1865–1946) and Vilho Penttilä (1868–1918) in 1895 and the partnership continued until 1908. The office {{was one of}} many joint architectural firms established in Helsinki at around that time – Gesellius, Lindgren, and Saarinen becoming the most renowned. Each of the partners had at one time worked for the master builder J. G. Rosenberg. Nyström was the leading figure in the architectural firm – only his first name was included in its official name. Albert Petrelius was both an architect and master builder and as well as being a partner in the <b>architectural</b> <b>form</b> also simultaneously worked for a fire insurance company, while the architect Vilho Penttilä was also editor-in-chief of the journal Suomen Teollisuuslehti (Finnish Industrial Magazine), and which provided an outlet for showing the works of the architectural firm. Petrelius and Penttilä were members of the pro-Finnish language and pro-Independence Fennoman movement (at that time the vast majority of architects were Swedish-speaking). In fact, some of the architectural firm’s customers were also connected with the Fennoman movement, in particular the KOP Bank (Kansallis-Osake-Pankki).|$|E

The <b>architectural</b> <b>form</b> of the building most frequently has the ground plan of a cross. This form is both functional and symbolic, its symbolism referring to the cross on which Jesus was crucified. The form is liturgically functional as it allows the building to be divided into sections where different activities take place, or that are occupied by different people, such as the clergy, the choir and the laity.|$|E

25|$|The {{churches of}} San Zeno Maggiore, Verona, and San Michele, Pavia, present {{two types of}} facade that are typical of Italian Romanesque, that which reveals the <b>architectural</b> <b>form</b> of the building, and that which screens it. At San Zeno, the {{components}} of nave and aisles are made clear by the vertical shafts that {{rise to the level}} of the central gable and by the varying roof levels. At San Miniato al Monte the definition of the architectural parts is made even clearer by the polychrome marble, a feature of many Italian Medieval facades, particularly in Tuscany.|$|E
25|$|Giulio Romano (1499–1546), was a pupil of Raphael, {{assisting}} him {{on various}} {{works for the}} Vatican. Romano was also a highly inventive designer, working for Federico II Gonzaga at Mantua on the Palazzo Te, (1524–1534), a project which combined his skills as architect, sculptor and painter. In this work, incorporating garden grottoes and extensive frescoes, he uses illusionistic effects, surprising combinations of <b>architectural</b> <b>form</b> and texture, and the frequent use of features that seem somewhat disproportionate or out of alignment. The total effect is eerie and disturbing. Ilan Rachum cites Romano as “one of the first promoters of Mannerism”.|$|E

At around 1000 AD, the Mezquita de Bab al Mardum (today: Mosque of Cristo de la Luz) in Toledo was constructed with a similar, eight-ribbed dome. Similar domes are also seen in the mosque building of the Aljafería of Zaragoza. The <b>architectural</b> <b>form</b> of the ribbed dome was further developed in the Maghreb: The central dome of the Great Mosque of Tlemcen, a masterpiece of the Almoravids built in 1082, has twelve slender ribs, the shell between the ribs is filled with filigree stucco work.|$|E

After the Limes Arabicus was {{abandoned}} by the Roman Empire, many of the castra continued to be in use.
