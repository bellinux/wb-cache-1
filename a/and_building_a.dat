5|$|As part of Oslo's bid to {{host the}} FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011, it was {{necessary}} to build a normal hill, as Holmenkollbakken only consists of a large hill. Several proposals were made, including converting Holmenkollbakken to a normal hill <b>and</b> <b>building</b> <b>a</b> large hill in Rødkleiva, or building a new hill in Holmenkollen <b>and</b> <b>building</b> <b>a</b> small hill in Rødkleiva. Alternatively, a new small hill could be built at the location of the demolished Midtstubakken, next to Holmenkollbakken. City Councilor for Culture Anette Wiig Bryn (Progress Party) supported building a large hill in Rødkleiva and reducing Holmenkollbakken to a small hill.|$|E
5|$|As of 2008, Arsenal's {{season ticket}} waiting list stood at 40,000 people. The {{potential}} for expanding the stadium {{is a common}} topic within fan debate. Potential expansion methods include, make seats smaller, filling in the dips {{in the corners of}} the stadium though this would block airflow, and replacing the roof with a third level <b>and</b> <b>building</b> <b>a</b> new roof. There has also been discussion on the implementation of safe standing.|$|E

5|$|In 1993 {{the park}} and {{pleasure}} grounds were acquired by the National Trust and it was {{opened to the public}} in 1996. In November 2002, a large-scale restoration project began on the cascade, serpentine lake and Gothic temple in the wilderness area, this is now complete. Extensive planting also took place in 2007. Future plans include re-roofing the grotto <b>and</b> <b>building</b> <b>a</b> replica Gothic temple.|$|E
5|$|The leading {{area of a}} {{squall line}} is {{composed}} primarily of multiple updrafts, or singular regions of an updraft, rising from ground level to the highest extensions of the troposphere, condensing water <b>and</b> <b>building</b> <b>a</b> dark, ominous cloud to one with a noticeable overshooting top and anvil (thanks to synoptic scale winds). Because of the chaotic nature of updrafts and downdrafts, pressure perturbations are important.|$|E
5|$|Work on {{building}} a smaller and cheaper computer began in 1952, {{in parallel with}} Meg's ongoing development. Two of Kilburn's team, Richard Grimsdale and D. C.

5|$|Alexander Luttrell, who {{inherited}} Dunster Castle in 1910, {{chose to}} live at East Quantoxhead instead, and it was left empty until his son Geoffrey reoccupied the castle in 1920, redecorating some of the rooms in a contemporary style <b>and</b> <b>building</b> <b>a</b> polo ground alongside the castle. The castle and the surrounding countryside at this time was very popular with the Luttrells for fox hunting and shooting.

5|$|Although {{the later}} saga {{literature}} narrates stereotypical accounts {{about the two}} kings, Eystein {{is known to have}} improved the infrastructure and raised buildings and churches, particularly across the coast in Western Norway and Trøndelag, from Bergen to the fishing centre of Lofoten in the north. Eystein's activities were especially centered in Bergen, which became an important international trade hub for fish at the time, helped by his construction projects. His activities in Bergen included moving the royal seat to a more central location in the city <b>and</b> <b>building</b> <b>a</b> new royal palace, as well as constructing churches and the Munkeliv Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Baba is Amir's {{father and}} a wealthy {{businessman}} who aids the community by creating businesses for others <b>and</b> <b>building</b> <b>a</b> new orphanage. He is the biological father of Hassan, a fact he hides from both of his children, and seems to favor him over Amir. Similar to Hosseini's father, Baba does not endorse the religiosity demanded by the clerics in the religion classes attended by Amir in school. In his later years, after fleeing to America, he works at a gas station. He dies from cancer in 1987, shortly after Amir and Soraya's wedding.|$|E

5|$|Between 1970 and 1972, {{a pair of}} Montagu's harriers, Britain's rarest {{breeding}} birds of prey, nested in the reed bed. The RSPB bought the reserve in 1973 for £53,000 (£,000 in 20). The Montagu's harriers did not return, but marsh harriers did, and the RSPB commenced improving the habitat and facilities, including embanking the lagoons <b>and</b> <b>building</b> <b>a</b> car park and visitor centre. Avocets, then still very rare in the UK, first bred here in 1984. The visitor centre facilities were improved between 1987 and 1989 {{to cope with the}} numbers of visitors.|$|E

Stowe wrote to author George Eliot to update her {{on the progress of}} improvements to the house in Mandarin, putting up wallpaper, improving plaster, <b>and</b> <b>building</b> <b>a</b> veranda that wrapped around the structure. She took pains not to disturb a giant oak and instead built the veranda around the tree. The house could accommodate as many as 17 family members and friends.|$|E
5|$|During 2004, Romney spent {{considerable}} effort {{trying to}} bolster the state Republican Party, but it failed to gain any seats in the state legislative elections that year. Given a prime-time appearance at the 2004 Republican National Convention, political figures began discussing him as a potential 2008 presidential candidate. Midway through his term, Romney decided {{that he wanted to}} stage a full-time run for president, and on December 14, 2005, announced that he would not seek re-election for a second term. As chair of the Republican Governors Association, Romney traveled around the country, meeting prominent Republicans <b>and</b> <b>building</b> <b>a</b> national political network; he spent all, or parts of, more than 200days out of state during 2006, preparing for his run.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1900s and 1910s, St. Louis began a {{building}} program that created parks and playgrounds in several deteriorating residential neighborhoods. Parks Commissioner (and former professional tennis player) Dwight F. Davis continued {{the development of}} recreational facilities during the early 1910s by expanding tennis facilities <b>and</b> <b>building</b> <b>a</b> public 18-hole golf course in northwest Forest Park. The St. Louis Zoo was constructed in Forest Park in the early 1910s {{under the leadership of}} Mayor Henry Kiel. Since the 1890s, St. Louis had attempted to control its air pollution problems with little success, but damage to buildings and flora made the issue more visible during the 1920s. Problems came to a head with the 1939 St. Louis smog, which blackened the sky and lasted for three weeks. A ban on burning low-quality coal solved the problem in December 1939, and the addition of natural gas for heating assisted homeowners in making the transition to cleaner fuels by the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|From 1974 to 1977, Oceanside police {{kept track}} of over 1,000 {{accidents}} that occurred along SR 76. A citizen action group known as Concerned Citizens for Highway 76 formed soon after. Caltrans began holding hearings again in 1979, proposing the building of an expressway {{as opposed to a}} freeway or to widening Mission Avenue. At one hearing, local officials criticized the delay, while others criticized the routing, the decision to build an expressway instead of a freeway, <b>and</b> <b>building</b> <b>a</b> route through an environmentally sensitive area. In May 1980, the state Assembly Transportation Committee approved a resolution that requested an answer from the governor at the time, Jerry Brown, and Caltrans as to why certain projects, including SR76, had not been started.|$|E
5|$|He {{began his}} playing career at Nottingham Forest during World War II, before joining Coventry City in July 1945. He spent the 1953–54 season as Coventry's first choice goalkeeper, but was {{otherwise}} mostly used a reserve player. He was sold on to Middlesbrough for £3,500 in 1955, and kept {{goal for the}} Second Division club for four full seasons after being promoted to the first team in the 1956–57 campaign. He lost his first team place in 1960, and in June 1961 joined Port Vale for a £750 fee. He took a free transfer to non-league Burton Albion in May 1962, where he ended his playing career. Throughout his playing career he built for his future management career by learning from Coventry manager Harry Storer <b>and</b> <b>building</b> <b>a</b> close relationship with Middlesbrough striker Brian Clough, six years his junior.|$|E

5|$|In September 994 Michael Bourtzes, the Byzantine {{military}} governor (doux) of Antioch and northern Syria, suffered a heavy defeat at the Battle of the Orontes {{at the hands}} of the Fatimid general Manjutakin. This Fatimid victory shook the Byzantine position in Syria, and posed a grave threat to its Arab vassal, the Hamdanid Emirate of Aleppo. To prevent its fall, Emperor Basil II himself intervened in the region in 995, forcing Manjutakin to retire to Damascus. After capturing Shayzar, Hims and Rafaniya, <b>and</b> <b>building</b> <b>a</b> new fortress at Antartus, the emperor withdrew, leaving Damian Dalassenos as the new doux of Antioch.|$|E

He also tasks Lock, Shock and Barrel, a trio of mischievous trick-or-treating children, to abduct Santa Claus and {{bring him back to}} Halloween Town. Jack tells Santa he will be bringing Christmas to the world in his place this year. Jack orders the trio to keep Santa safe, but the children instead deliver Santa to Oogie Boogie, a gambling-addict bogeyman, who plots to play a game with Santa's life at stake. Sally attempts to rescue Santa so he can stop Jack, but Oogie captures her as well.|$|E
