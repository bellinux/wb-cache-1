5|$|Ammianus' {{narrative}} {{makes clear}} that Chnodomar ordered <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> strong levy. Hence the presence at Strasbourg of all eight contemporary Alamanni kings and of the non-Alammanni allies.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{ground-based}} observations {{determined that}} Mathilde is a C-type asteroid. It {{was also found}} to have <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> long period of rotation of 418 hours.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} thirty-three {{in-flight}} anomalies were eventually reported. As {{well as the}} issues above, STS-8's more minor problems ranged from faulty thermostats to <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> high amount of dust in the cabin.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>unusually</b> {{prolific}} tornado outbreak for January produced 65 tornadoes in {{the deep}} South especially in central Alabama. Damage from the tornadoes totaled around $9.975 million [...]|$|R

40|$|Non-random {{features}} in the genomic data are usually biologically meaningful. The key is to choose the feature well. Having a p-value based score prioritizes the findings. If two proteins share <b>a</b> <b>unusually</b> large number of common interaction partners, {{they tend to be}} involved in the same biological process. We used this finding to predict the functions of 81 un-annotated proteins in yeast...|$|R
5|$|Evidence for {{the early}} {{appearance}} of galaxies was found in 2006, when {{it was discovered that}} the galaxy IOK-1 has <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> high redshift of 6.96, corresponding to just 750 million years after the Big Bang and making it the most distant and primordial galaxy yet seen.|$|E
5|$|Melanism is {{the direct}} {{opposite}} of albinism. <b>An</b> <b>unusually</b> {{high level of}} melanin pigmentation (and sometimes absence {{of other types of}} pigment in species that have more than one) results in an appearance darker than non-melanistic specimens from the same genepool.|$|E
5|$|No seed is set when pollinators are excluded, {{indicating}} that seed set must be pollinator-limited. About 96% of fertilized follicles mature, and about 82% of seeds mature. These {{are very high}} numbers for Banksia, {{indicating that}} there are no problems with nutrient supply. This species produces <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> high number of old flowerheads, or cones, per plant—typically more than 500. However, there are <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> low number of follicles per cone—often only one. Thus the number of follicles per plant ends up roughly average for a Banksia species.|$|E

50|$|Clorazepate (marketed {{under the}} brand names Tranxene and Novo-Clopate), {{also known as}} {{clorazepate}} dipotassium, is a benzodiazepine. It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, hypnotic, and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. Clorazepate is <b>a</b> <b>unusually</b> long-lasting benzodiazepine {{and serves as a}} majoritive prodrug for the equally long-lasting desmethyldiazepam, which is rapidly produced as an active metabolite. Desmethyldiazepam is responsible for most of the therapeutic effects of clorazepate.|$|R

5|$|The Snowhead {{mountain}} range, {{north of}} Clock Town, {{is the site}} of the Goron village. Normally a lush pine forest region most of the year, the area has been experiencing <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> long winter caused by a giant masked mechanical monster named Goht in Snowhead Temple.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm was}} {{responsible}} for 3deaths in the United States and brought heavy rains to Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Maryland. <b>An</b> <b>unusually</b> strong F2 tornado was spawned from Cindy's remnants and caused severe damage in Hampton, Georgia. Cindy also caused flooding and a severe blackout in New Orleans, Louisiana.|$|E

5|$|After the {{occupation}} of Veracruz, many military personnel received the Medal of Honor, <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> high number that somewhat diminished {{the prestige of the}} award. The army presented one, nine went to marines and 46 were bestowed upon naval personnel. During World War I, Butler, then a major, attempted to return his medal, explaining he had done nothing to deserve it. The medal was returned with orders to keep it and to wear it as well.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>unusually</b> {{heavy rain}} storm {{affected}} a GO train on July 8, 2013, when a record-breaking 123mm fell {{over a few}} hours. A Richmond Hill-bound GO train encountered flood waters in the Don Valley and stopped. As the crew worked to change {{the direction of the}} train, flood waters continued to rise and submerged the tracks behind the train. The train itself began to flood, and approximately 1,400 passengers had to be rescued by boat.|$|E
5|$|Another {{trend in}} {{contemporary}} Danish architecture is {{the emergence of}} a new generation of successful young practices, inspired more by international trends than by the modernist tradition in Scandinavia. The generation is spearheaded by Bjarke Ingels whose firm BIG (Bjarke Ingels Group) founded in 2006 has made <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> rapid transition into a well-established firm.|$|E

5000|$|Of {{the three}} copies (not all complete) in the Royal manuscripts, British Library, {{representing}} {{most of what}} survives from the medieval English royal library, one may have come to England after the capture of King John II of France 1356 {{at the battle of}} Poitiers (Ms Royal 19 D. ii). [...] <b>A</b> <b>unusually</b> late copy, never finished, was begun in Calais in 1487, commissioned by the Treasurer of the English enclave for presentation to the new Henry VII of England. The miniatures that were completed seem to be by English artists.|$|R
5|$|Cockroaches {{appear to}} use just {{two pieces of}} {{information}} to decide where to go, namely how dark {{it is and how}} many other cockroaches there are. A study used specially-scented roach-sized robots that appear to the roaches as real to demonstrate that once there are enough insects in a place to form a critical mass, the roaches accepted the collective decision on where to hide, even if this was <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> light place.|$|E
5|$|Collaborations was {{presented}} in <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> lavish package, designed by Drew Lorimer and Olivia Harrison. Housed in a hinged box, the four discs sit on cardboard bases inside album covers measuring 8½ by 8½ inches, with the enlargement from CD and DVD dimensions allowing for a closer replication of the original LP jackets. A limited-edition release, each copy of the box set came with an individually numbered certificate of authenticity.|$|E
5|$|His {{success as}} a fighter pilot also led to {{promotions}} and more responsibility as an officer. 1 May 1942 saw him receive <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> early promotion to Oberleutnant followed by appointment to Staffelkapitän of 3./JG 27 on 8 June 1942, thus succeeding Oberleutnant Gerhard Homuth who took command of I./JG 27.|$|E
50|$|In Indonesia, the mandap {{is known}} as <b>a</b> pendopo. <b>Unusually,</b> Indonesian pendopos are built mostly for Muslim communities. Many mosques follow the pendopo design, with a layered roof to {{resemble}} Mount Meru.|$|R
50|$|The Regent Theatre {{opened in}} 1929 as a 'cine-variety hall' and {{was among the}} first UK theatres to play films with sound. Designed by WE Trent, it was {{extremely}} luxurious, with a restaurant, 14 boxes, a resident Wurlitzer organ and organist and <b>an</b> 18-piece orchestra. <b>Unusually,</b> <b>a</b> manager's cottage was incorporated into the theatre design.|$|R

5|$|Jones Valley, the Wisconsin River {{valley in}} which Taliesin sits, was formed during Pre-Illinoian glaciation. This region of North America, {{known as the}} Driftless Area, was totally {{surrounded}} by ice during Wisconsin glaciation, but the area itself was not glaciated. The result is <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> hilly landscape with deeply carved river valleys.|$|E
5|$|Limousin cattle {{evolved in}} the French region now known as Limousin. The region {{comprises}} the historical French provinces of Limousin and Marche, which include the departments of Corrèze in its entirety, most of Creuse, and parts of Haute-Vienne. Limousin cattle adapted to the local hilly conditions of acidic soils and weakly mineralised granite, with large variations in temperature. These factors {{led to the development}} of a hardy breed with <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> thin but solid bone.|$|E
5|$|Many beetle species {{undertake}} annual mass movements {{which are}} termed as migrations. These include the pollen beetle Meligethes aeneus and {{many species of}} coccinellids. These mass movements may also be opportunistic, in search of food, rather than seasonal. A 2008 study of <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> large outbreak of Mountain Pine Beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) in British Columbia found that beetles were capable of flying 30–110km per day in densities of up to 18, 600 beetles per hectare.|$|E
