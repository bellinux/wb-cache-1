50|$|August 1985 saw {{the arrival}} of the 1.3 City and 1.3 City X. The 1.3 City was similar to the {{previous}} 1.3 base model. The 1.3 City X added full carpeting, cloth upholstery, head restraints, <b>a</b> <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelf,</b> <b>a</b> radio and a manually operated choke. These models also did without the plastic bumpers, having more conventional steel bumpers with plastic end caps similar to the Maestro van.|$|R
50|$|The 1FM was {{produced}} for the UK in 1992 {{to coincide with}} the 25th birthday of BBC Radio 1. Only 25 were made and each car was individually numbered with a small brass plate. The car was only available in black with 'Radio 1FM 25th' bodywork decals, grey speedline alloy wheels and came with all options fitted as standard. A special stereo system including a CD changer and <b>an</b> acoustic <b>rear</b> <b>shelf</b> was specified by Clarion. Radio 1 ran a competition on air to win one.|$|R
5000|$|To {{celebrate}} the occasion, Volkswagen marketed a final, special series of 3,000 Beetles marketed as [...] "Última Edición" [...] (Final Edition) in light blue (Aquarius Blue) or beige (Harvest Moon Beige). Each car included the 1.6 engine, whitewall tires, a CD player with four speakers, chrome bumpers, trim, hub caps and exterior mirrors, a Wolfsburg emblem above the front trunk's handle, chrome glove box badge, body coloured wheels, tinted glass, <b>a</b> <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelf,</b> and VW Última Edición plaque.|$|R
50|$|The {{tailgate}} opens over six-feet {{high and}} 60/40 rear seatbacks fold {{down for a}} flat cargo area. A hard cargo cover can fit flush on the floor when not needed and is reversible to carry wet or dirty cargo. The cabin includes several storage areas including a lockable center console that can hold a standard size laptop computer. The cargo hold is small size compared to most rivals and {{does not have the}} adjustable cargo tracks or <b>a</b> <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelf.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Bolero {{possesses}} a 3.3 liter V6 engine. The rear deck was {{slightly higher than}} the hood, making for a more aerodynamic design. Fiber optics were utilized throughout the car. A built-in cooler was {{also included in the}} <b>rear</b> <b>shelf,</b> dual cup holders for the front and rear passengers, and portable headsets behind the front seats.|$|R
50|$|On 22 August 1962, Charles de Gaulle was {{the victim}} of an {{attempted}} assassination at Petit-Clamart. He later said that the potentially fatal bullet had been stopped by the frame of the photograph of Anne that he always carried with him, placed this particular day on the <b>rear</b> <b>shelf</b> of his car. When he died in 1970, he was buried in the cemetery of Colombey beside his beloved daughter.|$|R
50|$|Some {{vehicles}} offer configurable cargo conveniences {{such as a}} shelf or board. They often serve various purposes. The multiposition <b>rear</b> <b>shelf</b> on the Chrysler PT Cruiser {{can be used as}} a {{table for}} a picnic, a second cargo layer, or a security screen. The Citroën C3 has a foldable segmented false floorboard that compartmentalises the cargo area, makes loading easier, and evens out the load floor when the back of the rear seat is folded down.|$|R
50|$|In 1999, {{automatic}} headlamps were added, and the Handling Group {{removed the}} speed limiter. In 2000, an interlock {{was added to}} prevent shifting the transmission from Park unless the brake pedal was pressed; and tether anchors {{were added to the}} <b>rear</b> <b>shelf</b> for child seats. The 2001 model year brought more changes, with an optional luxury group that included an automatic dimming driver-side mirror and supplemental side airbags. A more advanced EVIC (trip computer) was made optional. The 300M also received new jeweled taillights.|$|R
60|$|Josie was not satisfied. She peered {{under the}} bed, softly opened all the drawers in the dresser and finally entered the closet. Here, on the <b>rear</b> <b>shelf,</b> <b>a</b> {{newspaper}} {{was placed in}} such manner as to hide from observation anything behind it. To an ordinary person, glancing toward it, the newspaper meant nothing; to Josie's practised eye it was plainly a shield. Being short of stature, the girl had to drag in a chair {{in order to reach}} the high shelf. She removed the newspaper, took down a black hand-satchel--it was dreadfully heavy and she almost dropped it--and then replaced the paper as it had been before.|$|R
50|$|Fiberboard is {{also used}} in the {{automotive}} industry to create free-form shapes such as dashboards, <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelves,</b> and inner door shells. These pieces are usually covered with a skin, foil, or fabric such as cloth, suede, leather, or polyvinyl chloride.|$|R
50|$|The Corgi {{design team}} {{came up with}} the first model with an opening feature in February 1960, the Aston Martin DB4 (218) which had an opening bonnet. Steerable front wheels, jewelled {{headlights}} and <b>rear</b> lights and <b>an</b> opening boot complete with spare wheel were added on the Bentley Continental Sports Saloon (224) in April 1961, and by October 1963 with the release of the Ghia L6.4 (241) new levels of authenticity were reached. This model featured a number of 'firsts' with not only an opening bonnet, but also opening doors and boot, and a detailed interior with <b>a</b> <b>rear</b> view mirror, folding front seats, and even a model corgi dog sitting on the <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelf.</b> At introduction, the Ghia sold for eight shillings and sixpence, and even at this relatively high price around 1.7 million were sold before being withdrawn in 1969. By contrast, only twenty five examples of the real car were completed.|$|R
5000|$|DX: The more {{powerful}} DX, with a [...] 1.5 L D15B7 engine, manual passenger side mirror (after '92), tilt steering, intermittent wipers, side mouldings, rear wiper/washer, and <b>rear</b> cargo <b>shelf</b> as standard equipment. Despite the higher hp powerplant, the DX returns real-world mileage of 38 city / 45 hwy.|$|R
50|$|Dead {{spots are}} a result of the maximum {{overshoot}} requirement from above. The power delivered to the internal LF antennas has to be tuned to give best performance i.e. minimum dead spots and maximum average overshoot. Dead spots are usually near the extremities of the vehicle e.g. the <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelf.</b>|$|R
25|$|Dual zone {{climate control}} was a {{standard}} feature across the WH range, as was 12-mode trip computer {{integrated into the}} instrument cluster. Caprice including rear roof mounted climate control and stereo controls for rear passengers- rear passengers were also provided with two headphone jacks in the <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelf</b> and could listen to a different audio source to the front occupants. <b>A</b> <b>rear</b> flip down table was incorporated into the rear armrest, complete with storage pocket and cup holders. The exclusive-to-Caprice options included standard Howe leather seats, 260-watt 12-speaker DSP audio system, individual ignition key memory (not available in Statesman- stereo settings, seating position) for three drivers, upright Holden crest logo on the bonnet, chrome exterior door handles, as well as heated side view mirrors and auto dipping passenger side view mirror to avoid alloy wheel damage when reversing. Headlights could be set to automatically sense low light levels and turn on without driver input. Caprice featured a fine chrome vertical bar grille, while Statesman used a chrome matrix style front grille design, and lacked chrome exterior door handles.|$|R
5000|$|April 1974: Introduction of the R5 LS, {{same as the}} R5 TL {{but with}} a larger 1.3 engine, {{different}} design steel wheels, H4 iodine headlights, electric windscreen washers, fully carpeted floor ahead of the front seats, carpeted <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelf,</b> electronic rev counter, daily totalizer, two-speed ventilation system, rear wiper, and illuminated ashtray with cigarette lighter.|$|R

40|$|Loudspeakers in car cabins {{often are}} {{installed}} in positions primarily regarding design aspects. Acoustical aspects are mostly subordinate. For this reason loudspeakers frequently radiate against a window, the dashboard or the <b>rear</b> <b>shelf,</b> also <b>a</b> radiation {{to the floor}} room is common. Acoustical reflections at short distances causing interferences of direct and reflected sounds are {{the main reason for}} comb-filter effects at the listening position. For the measurements in this work two stimuli were used: a pseudorandom pink noise, recursively averaged over 15 seconds, when the measurement position was changed, and a sine sweep when the position was fixed during the measurement process. Both, microphone movements and head movements, lead to a robust averaging of the measured magnitude response, reducing significantly both the variations in the response and the comb-filter effects in the car cabin. Frequency responses measured by the process described here require less filtering effort to equalize the loudspeakers in the car cabin...|$|R
