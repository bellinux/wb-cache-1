40|$|The Karabakh conflict, {{which started}} in 1988, was {{accompanied}} by massive socio-political activities, different manifestations of ethnic violence, and torrents of refugees. How was the conflict manifested {{at the local level}} and in everyday life? What were the “people’s” mechanisms employed for conflict resolution in the time of crisis? Against the general background of the conflict, the case of the exchange of the Armenian village of Kerkenj and Azerbaijani village of Kzl-Shafag occupies an important place as an example of people’s diplomacy and civic initiative. The situation of conflict during 1988 – 1989 brought about the idea of exchange, new mechanisms of community self-organization, transformations of formal and informal relations of the authority, actualization of collective memory resulting in behavioural changes, as well as application of people’s diplomacy in the time of crisis.

The County of London Company had a generating capacity of 39.7 MW; it commissioned the first 100 MW of its Barking ‘A’ power station in 1925, this increased to 200 MW by 1930. [...] The 1919 Act established the principle of equal consideration for the interests of shareholders and consumers of each company. Dividends to shareholders were limited to seven per cent per annum and the amount carried forward in the accounts was also restricted. Profits over and above these conditions formed a ‘consumers’ benefit’ in the form of lower prices. Two-thirds of the consumer’s benefit was to consumers and one sixth each for the company’s employees and for the shareholders. Electricity grid interconnections in the 1930s, stimulated by the Electricity (Supply) Act 1926, supported the further commercial integration of the ‘No.1 group’. In 1937 <b>a</b> quadripartite <b>agreement</b> was made between members of the group.
