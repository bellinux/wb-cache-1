5|$|After {{a period}} of rest and recovery, Zita found herself {{regularly}} going back to Europe for the weddings of her children. She decided {{to move back to}} the continent full-time, in 1952, to Luxembourg, in order to look after her aging mother. Maria Antonia {{died at the age of}} 96 in 1959. The bishop of Chur proposed to Zita that she move into a residence that he administered (formerly a castle of the Counts de Salis) at Zizers, Graubünden in Switzerland. As the castle had enough space for visits from her large family and a nearby chapel (<b>a</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>for</b> the devoutly Catholic Zita), she accepted with ease.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies are {{distributed}} worldwide except Antarctica, totalling some 18,500 species. Of these, 775 are Nearctic; 7,700 Neotropical; 1,575 Palearctic; 3,650 Afrotropical; and 4,800 {{are distributed}} across the combined Oriental and Australian/Oceania regions. The monarch butterfly {{is native to}} the Americas, but {{in the nineteenth century}} or before, spread across the world, and is now found in Australia, New Zealand, other parts of Oceania, and the Iberian Peninsula. It is not clear how it dispersed; adults may have been blown by the wind or larvae or pupae may have been accidentally transported by humans, but the presence of suitable host plants in their new environment was <b>a</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>for</b> their successful establishment.|$|E
5|$|In 1525 or 1526, Gérard {{withdrew his}} son from the Collège de Montaigu and {{enrolled}} {{him in the}} University of Orléans to study law. According to contemporary biographers Theodore Beza and Nicolas Colladon, Gérard believed that Calvin would earn more money as a lawyer than as a priest. After {{a few years of}} quiet study, Calvin entered the University of Bourges in 1529. He was intrigued by Andreas Alciati, a humanist lawyer. Humanism was a European intellectual movement which stressed classical studies. During his 18-month stay in Bourges, Calvin learned Koine Greek, <b>a</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>for</b> studying the New Testament.|$|E

5|$|On-set computer-generated {{effects for}} the pilot were done by Thomas Special Effects. Certain scenes, because of time and money, had to be created digitally. The opening {{sequence}} showing {{the destruction of the}} water tower by a meteor was created on the computer. A persistent problem during production was the lack of cornfields. As realistic corn was <b>a</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>for</b> a show based in Kansas, this became a problem for the filmmakers. Over 10,000 stalks of corn were grown in a greenhouse {{for the pilot}}, but they only grew two feet high, which was not usable to the crew. The day the crew was filming the scene for Clark's landing there were no cornfields in the surrounding area. The cornfields had to be digitally added. Digital corn was a common substitute for the undersized corn that was grown, but for scenes where digital corn was not an option, six hundred stalks of fake corn were flown in from a manufacturer in Arizona. Other digital effects include the flattened cornfield where Lex was caught in a meteorite blast. Some scenes required physical effects, instead of computer imagery. When Lex drives his car off a bridge and hits Clark, the stunt performer, who doubled as Wolverine in the film X-Men, was literally hit by the car as it went over the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Through {{a series}} of miscommunications, Edward {{believes}} that Bella has killed herself by jumping off a cliff into the ocean. Distraught over her apparent suicide attempt, Edward travels to Italy and attempts to provoke the Volturi (powerful coven who act as vampiric overlords) to kill him by exposing himself as a vampire to humans. Alice, Edward's sister, and Bella travel to Italy to save Edward, and arrive {{just in time to}} stop him. Alice looks on as Bella jumps into the sunlight, and into Edward, preventing him from committing suicide. Realizing that Bella is alive, Edward explains to Bella that he always loved her and only left to protect her. However, the Volturi determine that Bella, a human who knows that vampires exist, must either be killed or transformed into a vampire herself. Alice stops them from killing her by sharing her premonition, in which Bella has been transformed, with Aro, a Volturi elder who is able to read thoughts through touch. Soon after, they return to Forks and Cullens again settle themselves in Forks. Bella asks Edward to transform her and Cullens vote in favor of that much to Edward and Rosalie's dismay. Later, Jacob reminds Edward, the treaty Cullens and Quileutes made years before that they will not attack each other, as long as the Cullens do not feed on any humans, <b>a</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>for</b> Bella's transformation. The movie concludes with Edward telling Bella that he will change her into a vampire after she marries him.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway caused {{a great deal of}} interest in Central and Northern British Columbia, and settlers were arriving looking for agricultural land, which needed to be surveyed before it could be sold or pre-empted. The equipment the surveyors used would be considered simple by today's standards, but it was remarkably accurate: a transit and a 66-foot length of chain (80 lengths to a mile). The pioneer surveyors did more than survey land, they also recorded the topography, soil conditions and potential uses of the land, information that was <b>a</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>for</b> the government and land-seekers alike.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, The World Bank {{approved}} a US$30 million loan for the Water and Sanitation Sector Modernization Project in Honduras.

25|$|In 1863, {{development}} {{along the}} banks of Potrero Point consisted of two powder magazines on the southern side of the steep peninsula, located so as to keep dangerous commodities away from populated areas.

25|$|Finally, {{the rise}} of tourism made {{knowledge}} of German an economic necessity in many areas, while the agricultural sector, which had been a traditional domain of Romansh, became less important. All this meant that knowledge of German {{became more and more}} of <b>a</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>for</b> Romansh speakers and that German became more and more a part of daily life. For the most part, German was seen not as a threat but rather as an important asset for communicating outside one's home region. The common people frequently demanded better access to learning German. When public schools began to appear, many municipalities decided to adopt German as the medium of instruction, {{as in the case of}} Ilanz, where German became the language of schooling in 1833, when the town was still largely Romansh-speaking.|$|E
