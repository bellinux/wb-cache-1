5|$|In {{a typical}} LFR {{instrument}} approach procedure, final approach would begin {{over the range}} station, with a turn to a specific course.

In the depicted Joliet, IL LFR approach procedure, minimum descent altitude could be as low as 300 feet AGL, and required minimum visibility one mile, depending on aircraft type.|$|E
5|$|MAR {{operated}} in two modes, surveillance, and engagement. In surveillance mode, the range was maximized, and each face performed a scan in about 5seconds.
