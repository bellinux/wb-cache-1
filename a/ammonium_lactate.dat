40|$|Abstract: To {{figure out}} the {{relationship}} between nutrient deprivation and cell growth, simulation can be effective. In the present work, the growth of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells was simulated based on stoichiometric and kinetics calculations. The simulation results were compared to the experimental data from a packed-bed bioreactor and a good agreement was observed. The kinetic parameters (K Glc, K Amm, K Lact and µ max) were optimized by a genetic algorithm method using stoichiometric parameters (Y X/Glc, Y X/Amm, and Y Lac/Glc). The stoichiometric and kinetic parameters {{were used in the}} simulation to study the growth of CHO cells. The concentrations of the toxic by-products, <b>ammonium</b> and <b>lactate,</b> were measured at different values of dissolved oxygen, 30 % and 50 % of saturated air. While dissolved oxygen was maintained at 30 % of saturation, the maximum that <b>ammonium</b> and <b>lactate</b> concentrations reached were 0. 099 and 2. 1 g/l, respectively. At dissolved oxygen level of 50 % air saturation, the maximum <b>ammonium</b> and <b>lactate</b> concentrations decreased to the values 8 of 0. 082 and 1. 8 g/l, respectively.

Experimental data were used as basis to develop a model of general application. Concentrations of fundamental nutrients (glucose and glutamine), inhibitory products (<b>ammonium</b> and <b>lactate),</b> and monoclonal antibodies (MAb) against bovine lactoferrin (IgG 1) were monitored over time. Exchange of nutrients and products occurred across the capillary surface, whereas cells and MAb remained in the extra-capillary space (ECS). A protein-free culture medium (Hybrimax) with and without antibiotics was used. In both cases, the final MAb concentration was the same; however, antibiotic presence slowed down the time to achieve this concentration.

The increasing demand for mAb manufacturing and the associated high production costs call for the pharmaceutical industry to improve its current production processes or develop more efficient alternative production platforms. The experimental control of IgG fucosylation to enhance antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity constitutes one of the promising strategies to improve the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies and to potentially reduce the therapeutic cost. We report here that the EB 66 cell line derived from duck embryonic stem cells can be efficiently genetically engineered to produce mAbs at yields beyond a 1 g/L, as suspension cells grown in serum-free culture media. EB 66 cells display additional attractive growth characteristics such as a very short population doubling time of 12 – 14 h, a capacity to reach very high cell density (> 30 million cells/mL) and a unique metabolic profile resulting in low <b>ammonium</b> and <b>lactate</b> accumulation and low glutamine consumption, even at high cell densities.

Forty-one of 55 patients (74. 6 %) were rated as “clear” (0) or “almost clear” (1) after two weeks of combination treatment. In the maintenance phase, the probability of physician global assessment worsening at six weeks in the steroid group was only 10 percent while in the placebo group the probability rose to 75 percent (p< 0. 0001). The probability of physician global assessment worsening climbed to 100 percent by 14 weeks in the placebo group while only increasing to 29 percent in the steroid group (p< 0. 0001).

40|$|Background: The {{production}} of recombinant proteins for therapeutic use represents {{a great impact}} on the biotechnology industry. In this context, established mammalian cell lines, especially CHO cells, have become a standard system for the {{production of}} such proteins. Their ability to properly configure and excrete proteins in functional form is an enormous advantage which should be contrasted with their inherent technological limitations. These cell systems exhibit a metabolic behaviour associated with elevated cell proliferation which involves a high consumption of glucose and glutamine, resulting in the rapid depletion of these nutrients in the medium and the accumulation of <b>ammonium</b> and <b>lactate.</b> Both phenomena contribute to the limitation of cell growth, the triggering of apoptotic processes and the loss of quality of the recombinant protein. Results: In this review, the use of alternative substrates and genetic modifications (host cell engineering) are analyzed as tools to overcome those limitations. In general, the results obtained are promising. However, metabolic and physiological phenomena involved in CHO cells are still barely understood. Thus, most of publications are focused on specific modifications rather than giving a systemic perspective. Conclusions: A deeper insight in the integrated understanding of metabolism and cell mechanisms is required in order to define complementary strategies at these two levels, so providing effective means to control nutrients consumption, reduce by-products and increase process productivity...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effects of}} <b>ammonium</b> and <b>lactate</b> on a culture of channel catfish ovary (CCO) cells were examined. We also made {{investigation}} on the influence of glutamine, since our previous research revealed that this amino acid stimulated CCO cell growth more than glucose in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect of ammonium in cell culture included the considerable decrease in cell growth rate with eventual growth arrest as well as the retardation of glucose consumption. At ammonium concentrations above 2. 5  mM, the cells displayed specific morphological changes. The effect of lactate was different to that of ammonium since the cell growth rate was progressively decreasing with the increase of lactate concentration, whereas the glucose consumption rate remained almost unchanged. Besides that, it was found that lactate was steadily eliminated from the culture medium when its initial concentration was relatively high. The influence of glutamine on CCO cell propagation showed that nutrient requirements of this cell line were mainly dependent on glutamine rather than glucose. The increase in glutamine concentration led to the increase in cell growth rate and consequent ammonia accumulation while the glucose utilization and lactate production were reduced. Without glutamine in culture medium cell growth was arrested. However, the lack of glucose reversed the stimulating effect of glutamine by decreasing cell growth rate and affecting amino acid utilization...|$|R

40|$|Neuronal {{activity}} is a high-energy demanding process recruiting all neural cells that adapt their metabolism {{to sustain the}} energy and redox balance of neurons. During neurotransmission, synaptic cleft glutamate activates its receptors in neurons and in astrocytes, before being taken up by astrocytes through energy costly transporters. In astrocytes, the energy requirement for glutamate influx {{is likely to be}} met by glycolysis. To enable this, astrocytes are constitutively glycolytic, robustly expressing 6 -phosphofructo- 2 -kinase/fructose- 2, 6 -bisphosphatase- 3 (PFKFB 3), an enzyme that is negligibly present in neurons by continuous degradation because of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway via anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC) -Cdh 1. Additional factors contributing to the glycolytic frame of astrocytes may include 5 ′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 (HIF- 1), pyruvate kinase muscle isoform- 2 (PKM 2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase- 4 (PDK 4), lactate dehydrogenase-B, or monocarboxylate transporter- 4 (MCT 4). Neurotransmission-associated messengers, such as nitric oxide or <b>ammonium,</b> stimulate <b>lactate</b> release from astrocytes. Astrocyte-derived glycolytic lactate thus sustains the energy needs of neurons, which in contrast to astrocytes mainly rely on oxidative phosphorylation. Neuronal activity unavoidably triggers reactive oxygen species, but the antioxidant defense of neurons is weak; hence, they use glucose for oxidation through the pentose-phosphate pathway to preserve the redox status. Furthermore, neural {{activity is}} coupled with erythroid-derived erythroid-derived 2 -like 2 (Nrf 2) mediated transcriptional activation of antioxidant genes in astrocytes, which boost the de novo glutathione biosynthesis in neighbor neurons. Thus, the bioenergetics and redox programs of astrocytes are adapted to sustain neuronal activity and survival. Developing therapeutic strategies to interfere with these pathways may be useful to combat neurological diseases. J. P.

40|$|Soil loss due to crop {{harvesting}} (SLCH) {{has been}} established as an important soil erosion process that has significantly contributed to soil degradation in highly mechanised agriculture. This has stimulated the need to investigate {{the importance of this}} process of erosion under low input agriculture where, until now, only water and tillage erosion are known as important phenomena causing soil degradation. This study was conducted in Eastern Uganda with the following objectives: (1) to assess the amount of soil lost due to the harvesting of cassava roots and sweet potato tubers under low input agriculture, (2) to look into the factors that influence variations in these soil losses, and (3) to estimate the amount of plant nutrients lost due to SLCH for cassava and sweet potato. Soil sticking to roots and tubers was washed and the soil suspension oven dried to estimate the amount of soil lost after harvesting. Mean annual soil loss for cassava was 3. 4 tonnes ha(- 1) and for sweet potato was 0. 2 tonnes ha(- 1). <b>Ammonium</b> acetate <b>lactate</b> extractable soil nutrient losses for cassava were N = 1. 71 kg ha(- 1) harvest', P = 0. 16 kg ha(- 1) harvest(- 1), K = 1. 08 kg ha(- 1) harvest' and for sweet potato were N = 0. 14, P = 0. 01 kg ha(- 1) harvest(- 1), K = 0. 15 kg ha(- 1) harvest(- 1). Difference in soil loss due to crop harvesting for cassava and sweet potato could be due to: (1) smaller yields of sweet potato leading to smaller soil losses on an area basis, (2) smoother skin and less kinked morphology of sweet potato that allowed less soil to adhere, and (3) the fact that sweet potato is planted in mounds which dry out faster compared to the soil under cassava. Soil moisture content at harvesting time and crop age were significant factors that explained the variations in the soil lost at cassava harvesting. Soil loss under cassava justifies the need to conduct further investigations on this process of soil erosion under low input agriculture. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The term Vitamin K {{refers to}} at least two {{different}} types of quinones. Vitamin K 1, phylloquinone (PK), is found in green leafy plants and several vegetable oils. Vitamin K 2, menaquinone (MK), is produced by the intestinal microbiota of mammals and birds. MK differ in the length of their side chain and the common nomenclature is MK-n, “n” representing the number of isoprenoids. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the production of MK by the canine intestinal microbiota and the influence of substrate (protein and starch) in two different in-vitro-fermentation systems. Additionally, MK concentrations were determined in the chyme of different parts of the intestinal tract of dogs (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum and colon). For the in-vitro-study, a semicontinuous long-term- and a 24 h short-term incubation system were tested for their suitability. Based on the results of these tests, the 24 h short-term incubation system was chosen as method. The trial was performed with three repetitions, each with ten airtight fermentation flasks. Faeces was obtained from dogs and diluted 1 : 100 in an anaerobic pre-reduced buffer with different amounts (0. 1, 0. 5 and 1. 0 g) of maize starch (Ms), peptone (Pep) and a mixture of both (Ms/Pep; 50 : 50) including a control. The bottles were incubated with slow rotation for 24 hours at 37 °C under subdued light. The pH was measured after incubation and samples were taken for the determination of volatile fatty acids, <b>ammonium</b> and <b>lactate</b> as fermentation parameters, as well as for the detection of MK by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The pattern of MK- 4 to - 10 was dominated by MK- 10 followed by MK- 9 and MK- 4. Lowest concentrations were found for MK- 7. An influence of the substrates could be observed regarding the total MK-concentration and the production of the different MK. The concentration of MK- 7 to - 10 increased after the addition of Ms and Ms/Pep and for MK- 5 and - 6 after Ms/Pep. Highest concentrations of MK- 4 were found after the addition of Pep. The analysis of the chyme samples revealed similar MK-pattern. MK- 10 was predominant in the caecal and colonal chyme followed by MK- 6, - 9 and - 4. In the small intestine contents the formation of Vitamin K 2 was dominated by MK- 9. Highest total MK concentrations were measured in caecum and colon with an average of 635 ng/g and 1045 ng/g, respectively. The concentration in the small intestine decreased from duodenum to the ileum. The MK pattern of the short-term incubation and in the colon digesta was similar. In conclusion, the results pointed out that a production of MK takes place in the intestinal tract of dogs and might therefore contribute to cover the requirements of vitamin K.

40|$|Medium chain {{fatty acids}} (MCFA) {{constitute}} a rapidly available energy source for humans and animals, {{which have been}} reported to influence the intestinal morphology or local immune system in pigs and to act against potentially pathogenic bacteria. Maintaining the intestinal physiological and microbial balance in weaning piglets is of high importance for the prevention of digestive disorders. It is generally assumed that the antibacterial effects of MCFA depend on the degree of dissociation of the fatty acids. The pH-value of the surrounding environment is therefore of high importance. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the antibacterial effects of MCFA by feeding the MCFA caprylic and capric acid with the short chain organic acids (KOS) fumaric and lactic acid to piglets, which should reduce the pH in the upper digestive tract. By examining the length of the villi and depth of the crypts of the small intestine, and by quantifying the intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL), the effects of the implemented feed additives on the mucosa of the small intestine and the local immune system could be studied. A total of 96 male castrated piglets (weaned at 25 ± 1 days of age) were randomly assigned into four different dietary groups in three consecutive periods. The control group received a commercial starter diet. The treatment groups received the same diet supplemented with either 1. 05 % of a product containing 71 % KOS (56 % fumaric acid, 44 % lactic acid and 29 % silicon dioxide (SiO 2) as a carrier), or 1. 05 % KOS in combination with 0. 3 % of an additive with MCFA (KOS+MCFA) containing caprylic acid (C: 8) and caproic acid (C: 10) (25 % of each acid and 50 % of SiO 2). The piglets of the treatment group MCFA received 0. 3 % of the same product with C: 8 and C: 10 (25 % of each acid and 50 % of SiO 2). The zootechnical data were recorded on a weekly basis. After a four week feeding period, three piglets per group (nine piglets in total) were euthanized and the contents of the stomach, jejunum, ileum, colon and rectum were collected for further analyses. Digestibility parameters were gathered by determining the pH-values, the apparent ileal and total digestibility of crude nutrients, as well as the dry matter. Lactobacilli and enterobacteria log cell counts were determined in the digesta by quantitative real-time PCR. Intestinal E. coli virulence factors were differentiated via Multiplex-PCR in the colon and subsequently quantified by real-time PCR. Concentrations of bacterial metabolites (<b>lactate,</b> <b>ammonium</b> and SCFA) were determined along the intestinal tract. To investigate the potential impact of the feed additives on the small intestine morphology and local immune system, tissue samples were taken from the middle of the jejunum for villus length and crypt depth measurements, and to quantify IEL. CD 3 positive IEL were determined via immunhistochemistry and flow cytometry, whereas CD 2, CD 5, CD 8 β. CD 16 and γδ -TCR positive IEL were only analysed by flow cytometry. Zootechnical data were affected in week three of the experiment, during which the daily body weigt gain was increased by MCFA. Significantly decreased pH-values were observed in the stomach, the jejunum and the ileum of the piglets fed the diets containing MCFA, whereas the combined feeding with KOS did not enhance the effect. The results of the study indicate a significant reduction of the cell count of enterobacteria in the upper gastrointestinal tract by dietary KOS. In addition, KOS tended to reduce the abundance of E. coli virulence genes in the colon. No influence of treatment was detected for lactobacilli counts along the intestinal tract. The bacterial metabolites D-, L-lactate and ammonium were not influenced by treatment in all intestinal sections. Only the total concentration of SCFA in the jejunum was reduced by dietary MCFA as compared to the KOS group, whereas SCFA in colon were reduced by feeding KOS. Neither the villi lengths nor the crypt depths were influenced by the treatment. The establishment of the antibody PPT 3 at the jejunum in pigs confirmed that the majority of IEL expressed the surface marker CD 3 and could be classified as cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. However, classic γδ -T-cells and Natural Killer Cells represent a large proportion of IEL. The flow cytometric data indicated that KOS increased the quantity of non-classic γδ -T-cells in the epithelium in the jejunum. In summary, the implementation of feeding MCFA and KOS and the resulting impact on the intestinal microbiota and the local immune system should be further investigated in an infection model trial...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of the probiotic Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 as a diet supplement (administered from the 1 st day post natum) on the intestinal microbiota of piglets. Using different PCR methods, we investigated (both qualitatively and quantitatively) the bacterial composition of the microbiota in the stomach, distal jejunum, and colon ascen-dens of piglets throughout the suckling period, the transition to solid food, and the weaning period, thereby keeping track of the applied probiotic within the gastrointestinal tract. Based on the expectation that similar bacteria and those occupying the same habitat are the most likely candidates for a probiotic influence, the main focus was on the gastrointestinal popula-tions of lactobacilli. For the trial, sows (Landrace x Duroc) and their litter were divided into a probiotic- and a control group and were kept separately. Piglets were weaned on the 28 th day of life. The sup-plementation of piglets in the probiotic group began on day 1 and lasted until the 56 th day of life. During the suckling period, from day 1 to 14, piglets received the probiotic via inoculum (4, 8 x 109 CFU/ml) and via supplement to the pre-starter diet (1, 6 x 107 CFU/g) from day 14 to 34. Starting on day 35, the probiotic was administered along with the starter diet (4, 1 x 106 CFU/g). The sow and piglet diet of the control group contained no probiotic. Five piglets per group were euthanised on day 7, 14, 35, and 56, respectively, and digesta samples were re-moved from the stomach, distal jejunum and colon ascendens. SYBR-Green real time PCR with spiked matrix standards was applied for the specific detection and quantification of the probiotic E. faecium NCIMB 10415 in the digesta samples. Qualitative changes of the overall bacterial composition in the samples under examination were identified using the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) method. Quantita-tive modifications to the microbiota on the genus level were examined by SYBR-Green and TaqMan real time PCR assays, using spiked matrix standards and primers for Lactobacillus spp., Enterococcus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., and Escherichia spp. On the species level, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. amylovorus, L. johnsonii, L. mucosae, and L. reuteri, as well as E. faecium und E. faecalis were quantified. Concentrations of <b>lactate,</b> <b>ammonium</b> ions and short chain fatty acids were measured in order to evaluate the degree of metabolic activity. E. faecium NCIMB 10415 survived the transit through the stomach and small intestine of the piglets and was found in the colon ascendens in high cell numbers. The highest concentration of the examined probiotic in the gastrointestinal tract was measured two weeks into the trial – subsequent supplementation led to no further increase {{in the size of the}} population. The ratio of E. faecium NCIMB 10415 within the overall bacterial population suggested that the exam-ined strain plays a subordinate role in the gastrointestinal bacterial community. However, in-creasing ratios of the probiotic regarding the total bacterial population in stomach and distal jejunum samples after weaning may point to modifying effects on the composition of the mi-crobiota in these localisations, which resulted from an early supplementation with E. faecium NCIMB 10415. Regarding the eubacterial composition, only sporadic statistically significant differences be-tween the two trial groups became visible before weaning. After weaning (days 31, 35, and 56), however, the microbiota of the stomach, distal jejunum and colon ascendens of the probi-otic piglets was significantly more diverse than that of the control piglets. At the same time, bacterial populations were more similar between animals of the probiotics group in all local-isations and at almost all points of observation, which also indicates a higher consistency and homogeneity of the gastrointestinal microbiota within that group. On the bacterial group level (Lactobacillus spp., Enterococcus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Escherichia spp.), the probiotic strain showed a significant beneficial effect only on Entero-coccus spp. in all locations and at all points of observations. The number of potentially bene-ficial lactobacilli tended to increase in the stomach and colon ascendens of probiotic piglets in both the suckling and the post-weaning period. As for bifidobacteria, no statistically signifi-cant difference could be found. The number of harmful Escherichia spp. was slightly lower in the probiotics group compared to the control group. Concerning the results of the analysis of gastrointestinal lactobacilli, an effect of E. faecium NCIMB 10415 on Lactobacillus johnsonii could clearly be discerned. The cell numbers of this species were significantly higher in the probiotics group in all three locations and both before and after weaning. The dominant lactobacillus strain – L. reuteri – was, however, not significantly affected by the administered probiotic. Cell numbers of L. reuteri and L. amylo-vorus tended to be higher in the probiotics group, but not by a significant margin. For L. mu-cosae, despite reduced presence in sample extracts (it is being detected in only a few samples), a statistically significant effect was detected: on almost all days of observation, both absolute and relative cell numbers of L. mucosae were smaller in the probiotic group compared to the control group. As this strain is known to adhere to intestinal mucus, this may be connected to a reduced cell turnover of intestinal epithelium. L. acidophilus was counted among the accompanying species within the examined population of lactobacilli – at no point in time and in none of the localisation was it demonstrably affected by E. faecium NCIMB 10415. With a view to the possible improvement of the microbiota through augmented production of lactate, only isolated significant differences between the two trial groups were registered. On almost all days of observation, there was a tendency for the concentration of l-lactate to be higher in the probiotics group, both in the jejunum and in the colon ascendens. There was, however, no correlation between the cell numbers of E. faecium NCIMB 10415 – or enteroc-coci, respectively – and the amount of lactate registered. Yet such a correlation was detected between the cell numbers for Lactobacillus spp. and single other lactobacillus species. This observation, along with the increase in cell numbers for L. johnsonii, the tendency towards a reduction of Escherichia spp., a lower concentration of ammonia at all points in time, and a quantitative increase of acetic and n-butyric acid after weaning in the probiotics group, sug-gests that E. faecium NCIMB 10415 does exert an indirect effect on the composition and ac-tivity of the intestinal microbiota of piglets...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{efficient}} {{process for the}} production of a ruminant feed supplement, rich in crude protein (defined as total N X 6. 25), by bacterial fermentation of cheese whey has been developed. The lactose in unpasteurized whey is fermented to lactate acid by Lactobacillus bulgaricus at a temperature of 43 degrees C and pH 5. 5. The lactic acid produced is continually neutralized with ammonia to form <b>ammonium</b> <b>lactate.</b> The fermented product is concentrated by evaporation to a solids content of about 70 % and adjusted to pH 6. 8 with additional ammonia. The concentrated product contains about 55 % crude protein. Approximately 6 to 8 % of the crude protein is derived from bacterial cells. 17 % from whey proteins, and 75 to 77 % from <b>ammonium</b> <b>lactate.</b> The efficiency of conversion of lactose to lactic acid usually exceeds 95 %. The fermentation time is greatly reduced upon the addition of 0. 2 % yeast extract or 0. 1 % corn steep liquor as a source of growth factors. Whey containing lactose at concentrations up to 7 % can be fermented efficiently, but at higher concentrations lactose is fermented incompletely. The process has been scaled up to a pilot plant level, and 40 tons of concentrated product were produced fro animal feeding trials, without ever encountering putrefactive spoilage...|$|E

40|$|Argonne and Vertec Biosolvents {{investigated}} {{the stability and}} perfonnance {{for a number of}} membrane systems to drive the 'direct process' for pervaporation-assisted esterification to produce lactate esters. As outlined in Figure 1, the target is to produce <b>ammonium</b> <b>lactate</b> by fennentation. After purification and concentration, <b>ammonium</b> <b>lactate</b> is reacted with ethanol to produce the ester. Esterification is a reversible reaction so to drive the reaction forward, the produced ammonia and water must be rapidly separated from the product. The project focused on selecting pervaporation membranes with (1) acid functionality to facilitate ammonia separation and (2) temperature stability to be able to perform that reaction at as high a temperature as possible (Figure 2). Several classes of commercial membrane materials and functionalized membrane materials were surveyed. The most promising materials were evaluated for scale-up to a pre-commercial application. Over 4 million metric tons per year of solvents are consumed in the U. S. {{for a wide variety of}} applications. Worldwide the usage exceeds 10 million metric tons per year. Many of these, such as the chlorinated solvents, are environmentally unfriendly; others, such as the ethylene glycol ethers and N Methyl Pyrrolidone (NMP), are toxic or teratogenic, and many other petroleum-derived solvents are coming under increasing regulatory restrictions. High performance, environmentally friendly solvents derived from renewable biological resources have the potential to replace many of the chlorinated and petrochemical derived solvents. Some of these solvents, such as ethyl lactate; d-limonene, soy methyl esters, and blends ofthese, can give excellent price/perfonnance in addition to the environmental and regulatory compliance benefits. Advancement of membrane technologies, particularly those based on pervaporation and electrodialysis, will lead to very efficient, non-waste producing, and economical manufacturing technologies for production of ethyl lactate and other esters...|$|E
