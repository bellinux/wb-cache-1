40|$|Environmental, political. and {{socioeconomic}} actions {{over the past}} several years have resulted in a decreased wood supply at a time when there is an increased demand for forest products. This combination of increased demand and decreased supply has forced more emphasis on engineered wood products, a varied category usually connected with adhesively-bonded end joints, of which the most common type is the finger joint. This paper presents the results of a finite-element analysis of structural finger joints, and focuses primarily on the effect of adhesive stiffness and thickness on stress distribution patterns in finger joints. Results indicate that <b>a</b> flexible <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> concentrates adherend longitudinal and radial stresses at the finger base. whereas <b>a</b> stiff <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> minim = adherend stresses but increases adhesive stress levels. Results also show that <b>a</b> thin <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> concentrates longitudinal adherend stresses at the juncture of the finger tip and flexible finger base and concentrates radial stresses at all finger bases. However, these increased longitudinal and radial stresses are balanced by reduced adhesive shear stresses.

50|$|One {{way that}} {{engineers}} and researchers {{are attempting to}} lower the costs of heliostats is by replacing the conventional heliostat design with one that uses fewer, lighter materials. A conventional design for the heliostat's reflective components utilizes a second surface mirror. The sandwich-like mirror structure generally consists of a steel structural support, <b>an</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer,</b> a protective copper layer, a layer of reflective silver, and a top protective layer of thick glass. This conventional heliostat {{is often referred to}} as a glass/metal heliostat. Alternative designs incorporate recent adhesive, composite, and thin film research to bring about materials costs and weight reduction. Some examples of alternative reflector designs are silvered polymer reflectors, glass fiber reinforced polyester sandwiches (GFRPS), and aluminized reflectors. Problems with these more recent designs include delamination of the protective coatings, reduction in percent solar reflectivity over long periods of sun exposure, and high manufacturing costs.|$|E
50|$|Electronic {{components}} are first positioned onto <b>an</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> of a temporary or permanent substrate {{according to the}} customers needs and design parameters. Then, the pre-tested, burned-in {{components are}} held firm in their positions through encapsulating them in insulating material and the entire assembly is then inverted. The adhesive layer is then cut (after removing the temporary substrate if it exists) or drilled out over the component leads mechanically or by laser ablation. These holes are then plated with a conductive, copper connection (vias) {{from the top of}} this layer to the leads. If needed, other encapsulation layers of components or vias can be placed {{on top of each other}} to make multi-level circuit connections. This construction is then coated with copper where needed to provide traces. Thus, this finished circuit board can now receive a conformal coating to protect against the environment, and then be placed into an assembly housing or be sent to another section for mechanical and/or electrical connections with other PCBs.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} method {{to determine the}} complete stress versus deformation relation for <b>a</b> thin <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> loaded in shear is presented. The method {{is based on a}} classic specimen geometry; the end-notch flexure specimen. The experiments are evaluated using an inverse method. First, the variation of the energy release rate with respect to the shear deformation at the crack tip is measured during an experiment. Then the traction–deformation relation is derived using an inverse method. The theory is based on the path-independence of the J-integral and considers the effects of <b>a</b> flexible <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer.</b> Quasi-static experiments on three different specimen geometries are performed using a servo-hydraulic testing machine. The experiments give consistent results. This shows that the traction–deformation relation can be taken as independent of the dimensions of the adherends. Thus, the constitutive relation can be considered as a property of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer.</b> The deformation process at the crack tip is also monitored during the experiments by the use of a digital camera attached to a microscope...|$|R

40|$|Sandwich {{restoration}} {{technique was}} one of the proposed procedures with the intention of improving marginal integrity of direct resin composite restorations, especially when the cervical margin is situated below the cemento-enamel junction. Co curing, which defined as the simultaneous photo polymerization of two different light activated restorative materials, claimed to decrease the internal stresses in resin composite sandwich restorations. The aim of this research project was to investigate the cause of failure with this type of restoration. This research included two approaches; experimental and numerical analysis. The experimental part included three experiments; (1) the main study which included 104 proximal RMGIC/RC sandwich restorations in premolar teeth using Fuji II and Herculite, to investigate the effect of the co-curing technique in comparison to separate curing on the presence of microleakage. Two further studies were undertaking using Typodont premolar teeth. (2) The first one was to investigate the effect of tooth angulation on the adhesive thickness. (3) The second one was to assess the effect of the application technique on the adhesive thickness Experimentally, it was found that: 1. {{there was no difference in}} microleakage between the two curing protocols, 2. the thickness of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> was far thicker than the manufacturer’s recommendations of 10 microns, 3. angulation of the tooth during adhesive application may have <b>an</b> effect on <b>adhesive</b> pooling and lead to <b>a</b> thick <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer,</b> 4. <b>adhesive</b> application is <b>a</b> sensitive multi-stage procedure and further work may be needed to develop <b>a</b> consistently thin <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer.</b> The numerical approach was a Finite Element Analysis, 1. to investigate the stresses distribution in the sandwich restoration. 2. to investigate the effect of <b>a</b> thick <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> on stresses distribution. The FEA results revealed that, 1. the stresses generated in the sandwich restoration were within the limits for tensile, compressive and shear stresses for the dentine, enamel, adhesive, Fuji II and Herculite materials; 2. the addition of each new layer can relieve (reduce) the magnitude of the stresses induced by the curing of the previous layer, 3. polymerisation shrinkage of the thick <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> generated high stresses at the tooth restoration interface. Conclusion: Polymerisation shrinkage of the thick <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> was responsible for the marginal failure of the sandwich restoration...|$|R
40|$|Polymeric ductile <b>adhesive</b> <b>layers</b> joining two elastic adherends is {{a common}} feature in various {{technological}} applications. Such joints can fail by ductile rupture involving interface debonding and void formation.

40|$|The {{use of an}} embedded-process zone (EPZ) {{model to}} {{investigate}} the mode I cohesive parameters for plastically-deforming, adhesively-bonded joints is demonstrated in this paper. It is shown that for the particular systems investigated, the cohesive parameters are consistent with <b>an</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> deforming in accordance with its bulk constitutive properties (as constrained by the adherends). In other words, these systems provide examples where the cohesive tractions exerted by <b>an</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> can be calculated simply from considerations of the constrained deformation of the adhesive. Consistent with such calculations, the peak stress in the adhesive layer decreases {{as the level of}} the constraint decreases (either with an increase in the thickness of the adhesive layer or with a decrease in the thickness of the adherends). It is also shown that owing to a compensating effect in which the critical displacement for failure varies with the constraint, the energy absorbed by the adhesive layer (the 'intrinsic' toughness of the joint) is essentially independent of the geometry in these systems...|$|E
