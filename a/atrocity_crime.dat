In 2017 the International Criminal Court (ICC) will be deciding upon {{whether or not to}} include crimes of aggression within their jurisdiction; effectively adding a fourth <b>atrocity</b> <b>crime.</b> These crimes are defined in the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the 1949 Geneva Conventions and their 1977 Additional Protocols, and the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.|$|E

Expanding the modes of liability to reach bystanders has the potential to raise such expectations, pushing the range of subjects that victims, survivors and others with an interest in the outcome of <b>atrocity</b> <b>crime</b> investigations and prosecutions expect will be prosecuted out beyond those as to whom there is likely to be political will to prosecute and certainly beyond the capacity and resources likely to be available to prosecute them.

40|$|Some {{have argued}} that NATO's air {{campaign}} against Serbia in 1999 was manifestly unlawful, others {{that it was an}} entirely legitimate humanitarian intervention. A third position suggests that the intervention while unlawful, in the strictest sense, was nonetheless legitimate. Here, a customary law right to intervene was seen as emerging, permitting action to prevent a mass <b>atrocity</b> <b>crime,</b> even when UN Security Council authorization was absent. Did Operation Allied Force, then, add to the case for the emergence of this new customary norm? While the 1990 s was a decade of humanitarian intervention, the decade since has been dominated by international action against terrorism and, of course, the effects of the highly controversial US and British led invasion of Iraq. In this context, there is scant evidence that a customary right or obligation to intervene for humanitarian reasons has crystallized since 1999. But if Kosovo achieved anything, it was to prompt greater attention to the merits of the argument in favour of a ‘responsibility to protect’. If NATO's 1999 action were repeated today in a similarly unauthorized manner it would still be unlawful, but it would perhaps be seen as a legitimate means to preventing a mass <b>atrocity</b> <b>crime...</b>|$|E

40|$|The English School {{focuses on}} the issue of {{humanitarian}} intervention, because "it poses the conflict between order and justice in international relations in its starkest form. " This thesis posits that international investigations and prosecutions of <b>atrocity</b> <b>crimes</b> poses the conflict between order and justice in international relations in an equally stark form. Diplomatic attempts to facilitate a negotiated settlement to an armed conflict (order) may be undermined by attempts to investigate and prosecute <b>atrocity</b> <b>crimes</b> (justice), particularly where individuals deemed crucial to any settlement become the specific focus of investigations. Similarly, attempts to arrest individuals indicted for <b>atrocity</b> <b>crimes</b> (justice) in post-conflict environments, may in some instances lead to the nascent, fragile peace (order) breaking down where their supporters retain the capacity to act in a destabilising manner.

40|$|Forcible {{displacement}} can {{constitute a}} mass <b>atrocity</b> <b>crime.</b> This {{is something that}} is considered within the non-binding Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. Efforts to implement the Guiding Principles at the regional level suggest one path to implement stronger legal protections for internally displaced persons (IDPs), in particular, against mass atrocity crimes. These regional processes, however, can vary in remarkable ways. In the African Union, the Kampala Convention has brought the Guiding Principles and protections against mass atrocity crimes directed at IDPs into regional hard law; it also includes robust implementation and enforcement mechanisms. At this stage, however, these mechanisms remain anticipatory rather than effective; consequently international assistance will be vital to entrench the rights anchored in the Convention. By contrast, ASEAN has introduced no overt protections for IDPs. However, its developing legal human rights framework through the ASEAN Declaration of Human Rights, coupled with the Association’s response to the Rohingya IDP crisis in Myanmar, suggests that a policy-focused change, while incremental, may be happening...|$|E
40|$|This chapter argues that, {{although}} {{the principle of}} R 2 P was initially underpinned by strongly cosmopolitan roots, since 2009 it has been defined and implemented in ways that elevate the importance of state responsibility.

40|$|Among the {{constitutive}} {{elements of}} the responsibility to protect (R 2 P), prevention has been deemed {{by many as the}} most important. Drawing on contributions from an international group of academics and practitioners, this book seeks to improve our knowledge of how to operationalize the responsibility to prevent genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and ethnic cleansing. The central argument is that the responsibility to prevent should be conceptualized as crimes prevention. The first part of the volume develops a strategic framework, which includes identifying the appropriate scope and substance of R 2 Ps preventive dimension and distinguishing between systemic and targeted approaches. The second section examines some of the tools that can be used, and have been used, to prevent the escalation of dynamics towards the commission of atrocity crimes (tools such as sanctions, mediation, international criminal justice, and the use of military means), as well as the operational challenges that tend to obstruct global efforts to prevent such crimes. The third and final section draws lessons from actual cases of preventive action, both historical and recent, about the relative success of particular tools and approaches. As the first edited collection of its kind, devoted exclusively to the preventive dimension of R 2 P, The Responsibility to Prevent intends to inform and shape the growing debate on how to approach <b>atrocity</b> <b>crime</b> prevention and how to build the capacities needed to implement the imperatives at the heart of R 2 P.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of the Responsibility to Prevent suffers from two key problems; causal indeterminacy, and a dependence on the political will of states, particularly the permanent {{five members of the}} Security Council. The vast array of factors which can be cited as potentially contributing to the outbreak of conflict and atrocity crimes mitigates against the determination of definite “conflict triggers”. This does not mean prevention is impossible but does limit the {{efficacy of}} "early warning systems". The dynamics of the "four crimes" within R 2 P's purview further limits the efficacy of prevention as the decision to engage in mass atrocities is taken in response to a perceived existential crisis. This significantly limits the scope for leveraging the "internal" aspect of R 2 P as the decision to commit these acts is invariably born from a belief that no other option is available to the potential aggressors. Thus the specifics of <b>atrocity</b> <b>crime</b> prevention places great emphasis on the operationalisation of the external dimension of R 2 P, namely the role of the international community. So long as the response of the "international community" is predicated on the political will of states, however, the efficacy of prevention in these areas will be limited, as the "international" response is prey to narrowly defined national interests.

40|$|This thesis {{takes its}} {{starting}} point {{from the need}} for a comprehensive approach towards justice following atrocities, and where not only the states in which the crimes were committed have a role to play. The thesis discusses <b>atrocity</b> <b>crime</b> (genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes) prosecution and reparations procedures concerning individuals as two appropriate courses of action, through which non-territorial states may contribute to atrocity prevention and justice for the victims of atrocities. The analysis addresses whether, under international law, non-territorial states are allowed to, required to, or prohibited from facilitating prosecution and reparations procedures and includes an assessment {{of the extent to which}} international law relating to reparations fails to correspond to that applicable to prosecution. The implications of the lack of correspondence are analysed in light of the historical connection and separation of the two courses of action, the procedural and substantive legal overlaps between prosecution and reparations, and the underlying aims and functions of prosecution and reparations. The study covers a wide spectrum of international legal sources, most of them to be found in human rights law, humanitarian law and international criminal law. The study shows that while non-territorial states are included in both conventional and customary law as regards prosecution of atrocity crimes, the same cannot be said in relation to reparations procedures. This serious deficit and inconsistency in international law, is explained by the framing of reparations, but not prosecution, as a matter concerning victims and human rights, thereby leaving the enforcement of the rules to the discretion of each state. Reparation is also considered a private matter and as such falls outside the scope of the far-reaching obligations regarding prosecution. The study suggests taking further the responsibilities of non-territorial states in relation to atrocity crimes. Most urgently, measures should be considered that bring the legal space for reparations procedures into line with that for prosecution in, for instance, future discussions by human rights treaty-monitoring bodies and in the drafting of new international victims' rights, atrocity crimes or civil procedure instruments...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{offers a}} {{philosophical}} defence of military humanitarian intervention (MHI). To do so, it develops the ‘other-defensive conception’ of MHI. The other- defensive conception of MHI draws an analogy between so-called rescue killings in domestic society and MHI. In a domestic rescue killing, a rescuer defends a victim against an unjust aggressor. In fact, the thesis {{argues that the}} rescuer {{has a right to}} intervene on behalf of the victim. This right is correlated to a negative duty falling upon the attacker not to resist the intervention. By analogy, a state that is guilty of committing <b>Atrocity</b> <b>Crimes</b> against those under its rule forfeits its equal sovereign standing in international society. As a result, an intervening state does not violate negative duties not to aggress the ‘target’ state. Further, like a rescuer in a domestic rescue killing, the intervening state is holder of a (moral) right to intervene. The latter obliges the target state not to resist the intervention. The thesis supports this claim through two additional arguments. First, it argues that because <b>Atrocity</b> <b>Crimes</b> constitute grave moral evils, a military response to them is proportionate. Second, states that commit <b>Atrocity</b> <b>Crimes</b> do not perform their sovereign function of preserving the peace amongst those under their rule. Accordingly, the purpose of MHI is not merely to halt <b>Atrocity</b> <b>Crimes,</b> but also to reconstruct stable political institutions in the target state. On this basis the thesis explores the following four issues: 1) the relationship between the declaration of war and its conduct, 2) the problem of non-combatant immunity, 3) the foundation of a duty to intervene, and 4) the ethics of humanitarian occupation. In doings so, it offers a comprehensive discussion of central problems in contemporary just war theory and the ethics of killing and saving...|$|R

40|$|Among the {{greatest}} threats to global security is {{the slaughter of}} civilians. This {{is due to the}} inconsistent reaction of the international community to genocide and other <b>atrocity</b> <b>crimes.</b> Whether it was the slaughter {{of hundreds of thousands of}} Armenians in Turkey in 1915 or Rwandan Tutsis in 1994, mass murderers act with impunity when there is not a forceful response. Contrast these situations to Vietnam’s intervention in Cambodia in 1978 that put an end to the Khmer Rouge’s nightmarish killing fields, or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) intervention in Kosovo in 1999 that protected ethnic Albanians from Serb brutality. Even though atrocities like these have been the hallmark of oppressive regimes throughout recorded history, they continue today in places like Syria partly as a result of the uncertain legality of the use of force to respond to these crimes. Strict interpretation of state sovereignty and the United Nation’s monopoly on authorizing force significantly limit effective response measures, allowing grotesque human rights violations to continue. In order to break the atrocity cycle, states must have the authority to use force to prevent and respond to <b>atrocity</b> <b>crimes</b> when the United Nations fails to act. A new strategy, led by the United States, is emerging in response to <b>atrocity</b> <b>crimes.</b> The doctrine of Mass Atrocity Response Operations (MARO) is developing as a result of several high-level reports and strategic publications highlighting the urgent need for more effective measures. Further support came on August 4, 2011, when President Barack Obama issued a presidential directive to create an interagency “Atrocities Prevention Board. ” This interagency body is tasked with coordinating a government wide approach to preventing mass atrocities. Of the many possible actions that can be taken to prevent <b>atrocity</b> <b>crimes,</b> military action— noncombat or outright intervention—must be included as a key element to deter and suppress violence. Still, due to the uncertain legality of intervention to halt atrocities, the new U. S. strategy could have a short life span largely due to inflexible interpretations of the U. N. Charter’s prohibition on the use of force and traditional notions of state sovereignty. Until now, scholarship has failed to address the application of MARO when there is no U. N. authorization.
