With the introduction of case-based rate systems and increasing cost pressure situations in the healthcare sector, the need for cost allocation controlling, key performance indicators (KPI), benchmarking and a well-founded basis for strategic decisions has grown rapidly in Facility Management (FM) in healthcare. In order to provide a holistic and practically oriented solution, {{it was necessary to}} assess the requirements of the different KPI specifications of the various non-medical support services in hospitals. On the conceptual basis of the Service Catalogue for non-medical Support Services in Hospitals, the development of a KPI model was conducted in iterative interview sessions with different subject matter experts for FM in hospitals. The result is the setup of a systematic metamodel as the basis for a comprehensive KPI Reference Model for non-medical Support Services / FM in Hospitals providing the basis not only for controlling and benchmarking steps, but also for the development <b>of</b> corresponding <b>adjustments</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> plans and cost center accounting, as well as for aligning IT architectures...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} episodes <b>of</b> current <b>account</b> <b>adjustment</b> {{in industrial}} countries {{over the past}} 30 years. We find that they were typically associated with a sizeable slowdown in domestic growth and a large exchange rate depreciation. There was no discernable change {{in the nature of}} capital flows in the period just prior to an adjustment, {{with the possible exception of}} non-residents' holdings of currency and deposits. This suggests that a current account adjustment may be an endogenous event - responding to the resolution of domestic imbalances - rather than an exogenous event where the size <b>of</b> the current <b>account</b> deficit itself precipitates the adjustment in the domestic economy and the exchange rate. Econometric evidence suggests that global developments trigger the adjustment, possibly because they trigger the unwinding of the domestic imbalances. We find that the bulk of the ex post <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the financial <b>account</b> was in private sector flows, primarily on the part of foreign investors. Finally, we document some notable differences in the <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the current <b>account</b> in the United States in 1987 compared with that observed in the other episodes.

If net operating profit after taxes is greater than cost of capital,economic value is created for the owners. Calculations of economic value added were made for Croatian company that can be considered successful according to accounting performance criteria. According to economic value added criterion this company destroys value for its owners. Economic value added measurement is only first step in changing corporate governance for value creation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the main macroeconomic, {{financial}} and structural factors that influenced current account developments in the euro area countries over the period from 1980 to 2008.

The results show that factors such as the level of development, demographics, macroeconomic policies and competitiveness, are important in explaining current <b>account</b> positions <b>of</b> individual euro area countries. Moreover, the analysis of short-run dynamics indicates that the EMU has resulted in longer periods <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> current <b>account</b> imbalances. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a new theory}} of international economics by introducing Heckscher-Ohlin features of intra-temporal trade into an intertemporal trade approach <b>of</b> current <b>account.</b> To do so, we consider a dynamic general equilibrium model with tradable sectors of different factor intensities, which allows for substitution between intertemporal trade (current account adjustment) and intra-temporal trade (goods trade). An economy's response to a shock generally involves {{a combination of a}} change in the composition of goods trade and a change in the current account. Flexible factor markets reduce the need for the current account to adjust.
