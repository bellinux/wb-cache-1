2500|$|Although American {{women have}} made {{significant}} strides in the workplace, {{they are still}} culturally and socially required to be mothers first and foremost. The cultural ideas of motherhood in the U.S. have {{given birth to a}} new ideal: <b>a</b> <b>working</b> <b>mother</b> who not only has a wonderful career but also manages to flawlessly balance her family and domestic duties as well. This ideal is known as the [...] "supermom." [...] The media is a culprit in this depiction: A study examining the portrayal of mothers in magazines showed that the most popular magazines in the U.S. still continue to promote the traditional role of motherhood while undermining homemakers by portraying them as superficial and negative. Instead, only the Supermom type is portrayed and rarely critiqued.|$|E

40|$|We use a {{sensemaking}} lens {{to explore}} how women managers experience and articulate work–life concerns upon their return to paid work following maternity leaves. We focus on 11 women who held different types of managerial positions, including vice presidents, circulation managers, and human resources experts. We found that our participants re‐framed the good mother image into <b>a</b> good <b>working</b> <b>mother</b> role that fit their lifestyles and interests. To accomplish this reframing, participants engaged in three thematic processes supportive of the good <b>working</b> <b>mother</b> image: (<b>a)</b> good <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> arrange quality child care; (b) good <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> are (un) equal partners; and (c) good <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> feel pleasure in their <b>working</b> <b>mother</b> role. These themes and image were both ironic and fragile constructions of working motherhood. Because these themes and images enable participants {{to make sense of}} and establish the worth of working motherhood to family members, friends, acquaintances, organizational members, and community members, they provide a reason why middle‐ or upper‐class <b>working</b> and stay‐at‐home <b>mothers</b> may be in conflict about work and family choices...|$|R
