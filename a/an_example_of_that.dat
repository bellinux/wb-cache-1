The automobile sector in Mexico differs from that in other Latin American countries and developing nations in {{that it does not}} function as a mere assembly manufacturer.

25|$|It {{seems that}} {{on the level of}} the organ, the leaf may be the {{ancestor}} of the flower, or at least some floral organs. When we mutate some crucial genes involved in flower development, we end up with a cluster of leaf-like structures. Thus, sometime in history, the developmental program leading to formation of a leaf must have been altered to generate a flower. There probably also exists an overall robust framework within which the floral diversity has been generated. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> is a gene called LEAFY (LFY), which is involved in flower development in Arabidopsis thaliana. The homologs of this gene are found in angiosperms as diverse as tomato, snapdragon, pea, maize and even gymnosperms. Expression of Arabidopsis thaliana LFY in distant plants like poplar and citrus also results in flower-production in these plants. The LFY gene regulates the expression of some gene belonging to the MADS-box family. These genes, in turn, act as direct controllers of flower development.|$|E

She and Lynch produced an exact re-creation of the original [...] "Physical" [...] video, filming of which took twelve hours. Series musical producer Adam Anders felt that Newton-John's appearance in the episode was organic, explaining: [...] "The best part of Glee is introducing new music to an older generation and old music to a newer generation. There's so much great music. We all listen to music in a vacuum, then we're exposed to things and love it.

2500|$|A {{variation}} of downloadable content is expansion packs. Unlike DLC, expansion packs add a whole section {{to the game}} that either already existed in the game's code or was recently developed after the game had already been released. Expansions add new maps, missions, weapons, {{and other things that}} weren't previously accessible in the original game. An example of an expansion is Bungie's most recent game, Destiny, when they released the [...] expansion. The expansion added new weapons, new maps, higher levels, and also remade old missions so that the difficulty would be meet the new levels that were added to the characters. Expansions are added to the base game to help prolong the life of the game itself until the company is able to produce a sequel or a new game all together. Developers at times plan out their games life and already have the code for the expansion in the game but inaccessible by players and they would unlock the expansions as time went on to the players, sometimes at no extra cost and other times it costs extra to get the expansion. There are also some developers who make the game and then make the expansions as time goes on so that they could see what the players would like to have and what they can do to make the game better. There are also expansions that are set apart from the original game and are considered a stand-alone game, <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> is Ubisoft's expansion [...] Freedom's Cry which takes place control of a different character than that of the original game.|$|E
