Nevertheless, Ormonde was in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>situation.</b> The Confederates held two thirds of the island. The English Civil War, started in September 1642, had removed the prospect of more reinforcements from England and indeed the king desired to recall troops. In addition the Scots Covenanters, who had landed an army in the northeast of Ireland at Carrickfergus to counter the Catholic rebellion {{in that part of the}} country in early 1642, had subsequently put northeast Ireland on the side of the English Parliamentarians against the king; and the relatively strong Protestant presence in and around Derry and Cork City was inclined to side with the Parliamentarians as well, and soon did so.|$|E

While AOK Norwegen indeed saw the greatest chance of success within III Corps, nevertheless it ordered Feige to resume his offensive towards the east, leaving him in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>situation.</b>|$|E

500|$|A problem arose {{historically}} {{which held}} up progress for twenty years: although {{we start with}} the assumption of three basic [...] "simple" [...] actions, {{the rules of the game}} say that if we want to calculate the probability amplitude for an electron to get from A to B we must take into account all the possible ways: all possible Feynman diagrams with those end points. [...] Thus there will be a way in which the electron travels to C, emits a photon there and then absorbs it again at D before moving on to B. Or it could do this kind of thing twice, or more. In short we have a fractal-like situation in which if we look closely at a line it breaks up into a collection of [...] "simple" [...] lines, each of which, if looked at closely, are in turn composed of [...] "simple" [...] lines, and so on ad infinitum. This is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>situation</b> to handle. If adding that detail only altered things slightly then it would not have been too bad, but disaster struck when it was found that the simple correction mentioned above led to infinite probability amplitudes. In time this problem was [...] "fixed" [...] by the technique of renormalization. However, Feynman himself remained unhappy about it, calling it a [...] "dippy process".|$|E

Clearly Sweden is in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> short-run <b>situation</b> resulting from errors of macroeconomic policy. In the late 1980 s there was an excessive expansion.

40|$|The {{report is}} to be commended in {{attempting}} to deal with <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> pastoral <b>situation</b> in <b>a</b> creative way. There is now a wide gap in our society between traditional Christian views on sexual morality, and much of social practice and belief. This chasm is a cause for much concern and thought for many Christians, particularly for those involved in pastoral situations in which the differences regularly confront them. How should Christian pastoral care address premarital sexual relationships, defacto relationships, increasingly prevalent divorce and homosexuality? It must be admitted that the churches have been of little pastoral assistance to the homosexual community, or, as the Report claims, to the divorced. The goal of preparing {{a report on the}} way the church should respond to changing patterns of human relationships and sexual activity in our society, with a view to promoting healing and wholeness in human relationships is a worthy one. Given the chasm, those with pastoral concern seek some form of reconciliation. Thus it is tempting to explore whether, as Christians, we hol...|$|R

The situation of women returning to the labour market after parental leave is also the subject of the presented master thesis.
