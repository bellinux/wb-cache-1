Historical Chinese culture has not recognized <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> sexual orientation, or a framework to divide people {{based on their}} same-sex or opposite-sex attractions. Although {{there was a significant}} culture surrounding homosexual men, there was none for women. Outside their duties to bear sons to their husbands, women were perceived as having no sexuality at all.|$|E

One of the teaching tools often used by Tristano, including for scales, was the metronome. The student set the metronome at or near its slowest setting initially, and gradually increased its speed, allowing a sense of time to develop, along with confidence in placing each note.|$|E

Medieval Irish literature portrays an almost unbroken sequence of High Kings stretching back thousands of years but modern historians believe the scheme was constructed in the 8th century to justify the status of powerful political groupings by projecting the origins of their rule into the remote past.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{terms for}} classifying individuals of low intelligence were medical or legal terms {{that preceded the}} development of IQ testing. The legal system recognized <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> some individuals being so cognitively impaired {{that they were not}} responsible for criminal behavior. Medical doctors sometimes encountered adult patients who could not live independently, being unable {{to take care of their}} own daily living needs. Various terms were used to attempt to classify individuals with varying degrees of intellectual disability. Many of the earliest terms are now considered very offensive.|$|E
5|$|Hamming {{set himself}} {{the task of}} solving this problem, which he {{realised}} would have an enormous range of applications. Each bit can only be a zero or a one, so if you know which bit is wrong, then it can be corrected. In a landmark paper published in 1950, he introduced <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> the number of positions in which two code words differ, and therefore how many changes are required to transform one code word into another, which is today known as the Hamming distance. Hamming thereby created a family of mathematical error-correcting code, which are called Hamming codes. This not only solved an important problem in telecommunications and computer science, it {{opened up a whole}} new field of study.|$|E
5|$|Nietzsche {{rejected}} fundamental {{components of}} Kant's ethics, particularly his argument that morality, God, and immorality, {{can be shown}} through reason. Nietzsche cast suspicion {{on the use of}} moral intuition, which Kant used as the foundation of his morality, arguing that it has no normative force in ethics. He further attempted to undermine key concepts in Kant's moral psychology, such as the will and pure reason. Like Kant, Nietzsche developed <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> autonomy; however, he rejected Kant's idea that valuing our own autonomy requires us to respect the autonomy of others. A naturalist reading of Nietzsche's moral psychology stands contrary to Kant's conception of reason and desire. Under the Kantian model, reason is a fundamentally different motive to desire because it has the capacity to stand back from a situation and make an independent decision. Nietzsche conceives of the self as a social structure of all our different drives and motivations; thus, when it seems that our intellect has made a decision against our drives, it is actually just an alternative drive taking dominance over another. This is in direct contrast with Kant's view of the intellect as opposed to instinct; instead, it is just another instinct. There is thus no self-capable of standing back and making a decision; the decision the self-makes is simply determined by the strongest drive. Kantian commentators have argued that Nietzsche's practical philosophy requires the existence of a self-capable of standing back in the Kantian sense. For an individual to create values of their own, which is a key idea in Nietzsche's philosophy, they must be able to conceive of themselves as a unified agent. Even if the agent is influenced by their drives, he must regard them as his own, which undermines Nietzsche's conception of autonomy.|$|E

We aimed to determine pediatric pain experts’ opinions of: (1) the importance and usefulness <b>of</b> assessing <b>a</b> child’s <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> pain in clinical and/or research settings; (2) {{the usefulness of the}} content of items within currently published adult-targeted resources for assessing <b>a</b> child’s <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> pain; and (3) important domains <b>of</b> <b>a</b> child’s <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> pain to assess. Forty-nine pediatric pain experts (response rate = 75. 4 %) completed an online survey. Descriptive statistics and frequency of responses were analyzed. Experts from all included disciplines reported that assessing <b>a</b> child’s <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> pain is important and useful both clinically and in a research setting (> 80 % reported very or extremely useful for each item). Experts considered that the content of 13 items from currently published adult-targeted resources was useful, but the wording was too complex for children aged 8 – 12 years. Experts considered that all seven of the proposed domains <b>of</b> <b>a</b> child’s <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> pain was important to assess. The findings can be used to inform the development of an assessment tool for <b>a</b> child’s <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> pain...|$|R
