Parizeau believed a second referendum was unnecessary and would only encourage the remainder of Canada to use delaying tactics. The draft initial Act featured a question only asking for the authority to declare Quebec sovereign.|$|E

5|$|Governor Harrison had wide-ranging {{powers in}} the new territory, {{including}} authority to appoint territorial officials and the legislature, as well as authority to divide the territory into smaller political districts and counties. One of his primary responsibilities was to obtain title to Indian lands that would allow future settlement and increase the territory's population, a requirement for statehood. Harrison was eager to expand the territory for personal reasons as well; his political fortunes were tied to Indiana's eventual statehood. On February 8, 1803, when President Jefferson reappointed Harrison as the Indiana territorial governor, he also granted Harrison the <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> and conclude treaties with the Indians.|$|E
5|$|By 27 April, Berlin was cut {{off from}} the rest of Germany. Secure radio {{communications}} with defending units had been lost; the command staff in the bunker had to depend on telephone lines for passing instructions and orders and on public radio for news and information. On 28 April, a BBC report originating from Reuters was picked up; a copy of the message was given to Hitler. The report stated that Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler had offered to surrender to the western Allies; the offer had been declined. Himmler had implied to the Allies that he had the <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> a surrender; Hitler considered this treason. During the afternoon his anger and bitterness escalated into a rage against Himmler. Hitler ordered Himmler's arrest and had Hermann Fegelein (Himmler's SS representative at Hitler's headquarters in Berlin) shot.|$|E

25|$|After Jackson {{was elected}} President in 1828 he {{resolved}} {{to finish the}} drawn-out question of removal for good.

25|$|The states {{filed suit}} in 1990 in their {{conflict}} over the water supply; federal court has affirmed the Corps' <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> the conflict. As the Lake Lanier project was authorized by Congress, {{each of the three}} states is entitled to an equal portion of the water; the project was never envisioned only to benefit metropolitan Atlanta, the closest large city and one that has developed rapidly since the late 20th century, greatly increasing its water consumption. The water flows are also regulated to support a variety of uses by states downriver, including preservation of marine life under the Endangered Species Act, and support for major seafood industries.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Paul {{went against}} the {{majority}} of Republicans and voted to block implementation of the Medicare Part D program, which expanded Medicare {{to cover the costs}} of medications for the elderly and disabled, and which prohibited the government from negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies to try to get lower prices for the covered medications. In 2007, he again {{went against the}} majority of House Republicans when he voted with all of the Democrats in support of the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act, which, if enacted, would have given the government the <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> Medicare Part D drug prices with the manufacturers. During the 2012 presidential primary campaign, Paul said that although he remains opposed to Medicare Part D, repealing it was not one of his immediate priorities.|$|E

Not able to submitting to the peninsula, Santa Anna imposed a trade blockade. The lock made the authorities of Yucatán (entrusted by his military victory) <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> with Santa Anna. On 5 December 1843 were signed some treaties where Yucatán restored relations with Mexico, but was governed under its own laws and rulers. In 1845, President José Joaquín de Herrera ignored treaties and again caused the break between Yucatán and Mexico.After that federalism was restored in 1846, Yucatán decided to join to Mexico, but the folksy fraction was opposed to the reinstatement arguing that Mexico was in conflict with United States.|$|R
50|$|The {{last time}} the President was granted {{fast-track}} <b>authority</b> was <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> the Uruguay Round Agreement of the World Trade Organization. The Uruguay Round was completed just as fast-track authority expired in 1994. The President went without the authority until it was renewed in 2002. The trade promotion authority expired in July 2007 (except for agreements already under negotiation), but was granted again by the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015.|$|R
5|$|Prior to the 1943 {{national}} elections in French Mandatory Syria, the French <b>authorities</b> attempted <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> with Quwatli {{as head of}} the National Bloc to issue a treaty that guaranteed an independent Syria's alignment and close military cooperation with France, in return for French help in securing Quwatli's election to the presidency.

Quwatli did win the vote, becoming Syria's president on 17 August 1943.|$|R
25|$|Soon afterwards, in November 1643, by the king's orders, Ormonde {{dispatched}} {{a body of}} his troops into England to fight on the Royalist side in the Civil War, estimated at 4,000 troops, half of whom were sent from Cork. In November 1643 the king appointed Ormonde as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland—head of the Irish government executive, in other words. For {{the previous two years}} the occupant of this post had not set foot in Ireland. Ormonde's assigned mission was to prevent the king's Parliamentarian enemies from being reinforced from Ireland, and to aim to deliver more troops to fight for the Royalist side in England. To these ends, he had instructions to do all in his power to keep the Scottish Covenanter army in the north of Ireland occupied. He was also given the king's <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> a Treaty with the Catholic Confederation which could allow their troops to be redirected against the Parliamentarians.|$|E
25|$|The First Peace of Thorn of 1411 did {{not resolve}} long-standing {{territorial}} disputes between the Teutonic Knights and the Polish–Lithuanian union. The peace transferred Samogitia to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, {{but only for}} the lifetimes of Polish King Jogaila (Władysław II Jagiełło) and Lithuanian Grand Duke Vytautas. At the time both rulers were aged men. Soon disagreements arose as to the Samogitian borders: Vytautas claimed that the entire northern bank of the Neman River, including the port of Memel (Klaipėda), was Samogitian territory. The dispute was mediated at the Council of Constance and by Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor. When Sigismund delivered an unfavorable judgment to the Lithuanians, Jogaila and Vytautas invaded the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights in July 1422, starting the Gollub War. The Teutonic Knights, led by Grand Master Paul von Rusdorf, were unable to mount a suitable defense. However Poland–Lithuania decided to end the conflict before reinforcements from the Holy Roman Empire could arrive through Farther Pomerania. A truce was signed on 17 September 1422. Each side named eight representatives, gave them full <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate,</b> {{and sent them to}} the Polish Army camp near Lake Melno. The Treaty of Melno was concluded ten days later, on 27 September.|$|E
500|$|Success on the Turkish front continued, mostly {{attributable}} to Potemkin. He now {{had the opportunity}} to confront the Turks and dictate a peace, but that would mean leaving Catherine. His procrastination soured Catherine's attitude towards him, a situation compounded by Potemkin's choice of the married Princess Paskovia Adreevna Golitsyna (née Shuvalova) as his latest mistress. In the end, Potemkin was given the requisite <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> with the Turks (and, afterwards, to pursue his Polish ambitions), and dispatched by Catherine back to the south. She sent a note after him, reading [...] "Goodbye my friend, I kiss you".|$|E

5000|$|... {{one major}} {{discrepancy}} between the band council system and older systems of governance is the imposed presence of a Chief. European colonists when encountering Sachems (whose sole <b>authority</b> was <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> land use between family groups so that over-hunting would not occur) erroneously believed they were encountering village or community headmen. This historical error has had devastating effects for the formulation of local governance {{as many of the}} people themselves {{have come to believe that}} older systems of governance were hierarchical when in fact they were purely horizontal in power distribution between individuals.|$|R

Harrison was eager to expand the territory, as his political fortunes were tied to Indiana's rise to statehood. In 1803 President Thomas Jefferson granted Harrison <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> and conclude treaties with the Native American tribes in the territory.

500|$|Canadian Senator Douglas Roche, O.C., {{argues in}} The Case for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly that even an {{indirectly}} elected UNPA consisting of delegates appointed by national parliaments could create additional {{checks and balances}} by providing for oversight by a parliamentary body that would be independent of member nations' executive branches. It would open up the global policymaking process to a larger group of elected officials by shifting some power from the relatively small executive branches of countries to the larger legislative branches. According to Roche, globalization has tended to increase {{the power of the}} executive branch while marginalizing the legislative branch; for instance, U.S. Presidents since George H. W. Bush have been given [...] <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> trade agreements, subject to a [...] "yea or nay" [...] scrutiny by the U.S. Congress on the negotiated deal. A Property and Environment Research Center report argues that changes in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are another example of how international regulation removes checks and balances between the branches of government: [...] "The OECD was created by a 1961 treaty, ratified by the U.S. Senate, to help achieve economic growth. In April 1998, a ministerial meeting reinterpreted the treaty, adding social and environmental considerations to the economic ones. The United States executive branch agreed to the changes, but the Senate had no opportunity to debate this treaty, even though it was significantly different from the 1961 treaty. The executive branch had essentially negotiated a new deal without Senate approval." [...] World Federalist Canada Briefing Paper No. 30, however, suggests that UNPA proposals may spark opposition from the executive branches that stand to lose power: [...] "Experience has shown that civil servants and diplomats working in national foreign ministries are less likely to support or see the need for a UNPA. They view the UN as a forum for discussion among sovereign states; whatever action the UN takes is a result of bargaining and compromise among member states".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the role}} that federal and local elites played in the transformation of a non-violent movement of peasant protest in Chiapas, Mexico, into a guerrilla movement that eventually embraced a programme of ethnoterritorial demands. It is argued that the contradictory government responses to initial peasant protest {{opened the door for}} the radicalization of indigenous mobilisation and demands. Claims for agrarian reform in the 1970 s were met with piecemeal/clientelistic land redistribution and police repression. When demands shifted in the 1980 s from land reform to the democratisation of local governance and respect for human rights, local elites insisted on clientelism and repression. This led to the Zapatista insurrection of 1994. Unsuccessful attempts by federal <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> a peace settlement while clientelistic social reformism and military repression were underway led the Zapatistas into embracing a programme of ethnoterritorial demands and into the creation of de facto autonomous governments in the 1990 s. This paper suggests that neither policies of carrots and sticks pursued under authoritarian rule nor limited multicultural reforms approved by democratic governments have provided any meaningful incentive to organised Indians in Chiapas to leave off the streets or to lay off arms...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} how {{public transport}} planning is managed in institutional contexts where governance is spread across {{local and regional}} scales. The paper sheds light on two facets {{of the relationship between}} local and regional government: first, the decision-making process regarding where to provide public transport services and at what level, and second, integration of public transport with land use planning. An analytical matrix is used to cross-reference the roles of formal institutions (governance established in law) and informal institutions (governance not established in law) against local and regional responsibilities for public transport and land use. Analysis of the interplay between these three axes (formal/informal, local/regional, public transport/land use) reveals how informal institutions help regional and local <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> the constraints of formal, statutory institutions and help to “oil the wheels” of delivering measures and policies that make public transport work as a well-functioning system. However, informal institutions clearly have their limits, in the paper exemplified by the remaining challenges to integrate regional public transport and local land use planning. An identified challenge is that, by their very nature, informal institutions are difficult to influence or modify, therefore relying on them to fill gaps in formal institutional responsibilities may be a risky strategy when unpopular decisions are made...|$|R
