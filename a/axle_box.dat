5|$|All {{but one of}} the trams had a SV36-bogie from Strømmens Værksted. The two bogies, {{each with}} two axles, were {{attached}} to the steel crossbeam. The aluminium body was attached to the crossbeam with leaf springs. The bogie frames were fastened to the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> via a revolute joint and a spiral spring. Each bogie had two motors, each controlling one axle. In 1941, no. 187 was equipped with a SV41-bogie from Strømmen; it had a different spring system that allowed the tram to remain at the same height independent of the weight.|$|E

25|$|In a move {{to retire}} the last Gullfisk before their next main revision, Oslo Sporveier rebuilt some of the SM53 units to allow them again to run on the {{suburban}} lines. This time vertical suspension was installed between the bogies and <b>axle</b> <b>box,</b> finally solving the issue with the swaying. Other improvements included a car horn, a new pantograph and dead man's control. This gave Oslo Sporveier 50 trams and 33 trailers—and too few of the latter. This resulted in seven used S27 trams being bought from Gothenburg and designated TBG and entering service between 27 November 1985 and 16 January 1986. They received a new interior between 1990 and 1993.|$|E
25|$|The Class GL had {{a rocking}} grate and {{self-cleaning}} hopper ashpan {{with water and}} steam sprayers to dampen down the ash {{to prevent it from}} entering <b>axle</b> <b>boxes,</b> motion areas and other friction-sensitive places. They had self-cleaning type smokeboxes and their <b>axle</b> <b>boxes</b> were grease-lubricated.|$|R
50|$|The {{coupled axles}} had {{overhung}} springing using leaf springs. An equalising beam, {{level with the}} <b>axle</b> <b>boxes,</b> linked the two springs. On the final batch of 1869 the springs were located underneath the <b>axle</b> <b>boxes</b> of the coupled wheels. On the carrying axle the springs were above the frame.|$|R

50|$|The primary {{suspension}} in an ICF Bogie {{is through a}} dashpot arrangement. The dashpot arrangement consists of a cylinder (lower spring seat) and the piston (<b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide). <b>Axle</b> <b>box</b> springs are placed on the lower spring seat placed on the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> wing of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> housing assembly. A rubber or a Hytrel washer is placed below the lower spring seat for cushioning effect. The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide is welded to the bogie frame. The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide acts as a piston. A homopolymer acetyle washer {{is placed on the}} lower end of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide. The end portion of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide is covered with a guide cap, which has holes in it. A sealing ring is placed near the washer and performs the function of a piston ring. The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide moves in the lower spring seat filled with dashpot oil. This arrangement provides the dampening effect during the running of the coach.|$|E
50|$|The {{cylinder}} piston {{arrangement of the}} dashpot, i.e. the Lower Spring seat and the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide is not fully sealed due to the limitation of the design and practical applicability. Its design provides that when a vertical vibration occurs during {{the movement of the}} railway coach, the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide moves down. The downward movement of the <b>Axle</b> <b>box</b> guide puts pressure on the oil in the lower spring seat. The oil rushes up. However, since there are holes in the guide cap, the oil passes through these holes into the hollow body of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide. This helps in dampening the vertical vibrations. The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide displaces the oil in the lower spring seat and pushes it upwards. Since, only part quantity of oil is able to move up in the hollow portion of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide, the balance displaced oil moves up.|$|E
50|$|Roller {{bearings}} {{are used}} on the ICF bogies. These bearings are press fitted on the axle journal by heating the bearings at a temperature of 80 to 100 °C in an induction furnace. Before fitting the roller bearing, an axle collar is press fitted. The collar ensures that the bearing does not move towards {{the center of the}} axle. After pressing the collar, a rear cover for the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> is fitted. The rear cover has two main grooves. In one of the grooves, a nitrile rubber sealing ring is placed. The sealing ring ensures that the grease in the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> housing does not seep out during the running of the wheels. A woolen felt ring is placed in another groove. After the rear cover, a retaining ring is placed. The retaining ring is made of steel and is a press fit. The retaining ring ensures that the rear cover assembly is secured tightly between the axle collar and the retaining ring and stays at one place. The roller bearing is pressed after the retraining ring. Earlier, the collar and the bearings were heated in an oil bath. But now the practices has been discontinued and an induction furnace is used to heat them before fitting on the axle. The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> housing, which is a steel casting, is then placed on the axle. The bearing is housed in the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> housing. <b>Axle</b> <b>box</b> grease is filled in the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> housing. Each <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> housing is filled with approximately 2.5 kg. of grease. The front cover for the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> is placed on a housing which closes the <b>axle</b> <b>box.</b> The front cover is bolted by using torque wrench.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, rubber washers {{have been}} used at the seating {{arrangement}} of the primary springs of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> housing in the ICF design passenger coaches on the Indian Railways. The rubber washer is used directly on the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> seating area. the lower spring seat sits on the washers. The lower spring seat is a tubular structure and 3/4 section is partitioned by using a circular ring which is welded at the 3/4 section. On the top of spring seat, a polymer ring called NFTC ring sits. The primary spring sits on the NFTC ring. The lower spring seat {{plays the role of}} a cylinder in the dashpot arrangement and is filled with oil. In the dashpot arrangement, the top portion is called the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide. The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide is welded to the bogie frame. The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide works as a piston in the Lower spring seat filled with oil. This helps in damping the vibrations caused during running train operation.|$|E
50|$|Within 6 {{months of}} {{provision}} of Hytrel washers {{on all the}} main line coaches, the failure of <b>Axle</b> <b>box</b> housing increased. The reason was the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> wing cracks. Hence on examination of the failed axle boxes, it was noticed that the Hytrel washers were forming a deep groove of 4 to 8mm on the seating area of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> spring seating. They washers were also increasing {{the diameter of the}} spring seating due to continuous hitting of the raised section of the sitting area.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Axle</b> <b>box</b> {{suspensions}} absorb shocks {{between the}} axle bearings and the bogie frame. The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> suspension usually {{consists of a}} spring between the bogie frame and axle bearings to permit up-and-down movement, and sliders to prevent lateral movement. A more modern design uses solid rubber springs.|$|E
50|$|All coupled wheels were flanged. The <b>axle</b> <b>boxes</b> of {{the leading}} and {{trailing}} wheels were equipped with roller bearings while the solid bronze coupled wheel <b>axle</b> <b>boxes</b> were soft grease-lubricated. Soft grease lubrication was used throughout for the motion gear, except the piston rods, valve spindles and main crossheads which were oil-lubricated. Two four-feed sight lubricators, arranged in the cab, supplied oil to the steam chests and cylinders.|$|R

50|$|The <b>axle</b> <b>boxes</b> of {{the leading}} and {{trailing}} wheels on each engine unit were equipped with roller bearings while the solid bronze coupled wheel <b>axle</b> <b>boxes</b> were fitted with Ajax grease lubrication systems. Soft grease lubrication was used throughout for the motion gear, except the piston rods, valve spindles and main crossheads which were oil-lubricated. Two four-feed sight lubricators, arranged in the cab, supplied oil to the steam chests, cylinders and the ball joint of the main steam pipes on each engine unit.|$|R
50|$|The {{bottom of}} the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide has a guide cap with {{perforations}} so that during the downward movement of the axle guide in the lower spring seat, the oil in the dashpot rushes in the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide. This provides the dampening of vibration in a running coach.|$|E

50|$|The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide, {{which is}} welded to the bogie frame has a polymer washer (homopolymer acetal guide) bush fixed at the head. A polymer packing ring and {{a guide ring}} is {{attached}} with the Acetal guide bush. These two components act as piston rings for the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide. In {{order to ensure that}} the packing ring and the guide ring retain their respective place, a dashpot spring is fixed which applies continuous pressure on the piston ring.|$|E
50|$|The leading and {{trailing}} {{carrying wheels}} were fitted in F.W. Webb-type radial axleboxes. Webb's arrangement {{consisted of two}} radial <b>axle</b> <b>boxes</b> joined by a curved casting, so that they moved in unison between curved steel plates bolted to the main frame. A bogie check spring, having a single spiral spring, was enclosed in a box secured to the curved plates. The arcs of the leading and trailing radial <b>axle</b> <b>boxes</b> were struck from a centre midway between the coupled wheels.|$|R

50|$|Along with Anderson, Fowler was {{responsible}} for the adoption by the LMS of the Midland's small engine policy. Various Midland standard types were built by the LMS, including the 4P Midland Compound 4-4-0, the 2P 4-4-0, the 4F 0-6-0, and the 3F 0-6-0T. The small engine policy resulted in frequent double-heading, as the locomotives were not powerful enough to cope with loads, and thus increased expense. Standardisation also left these standard locomotives with short-travel valves and small <b>axle</b> <b>boxes,</b> the former leading to inefficiency and the latter to frequent hot <b>axle</b> <b>boxes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The cylinders, with rotary cam {{poppet valve}} gear, were {{identical}} {{to those of the}} Class 19C but with the stroke reduced from 26 in to 24 in. The modified cylinder covers had deep spigots to suit the reduction in stroke. The main drive and valve gear drive was from the third pair of coupled wheels. Grease lubrication was provided for all coupled wheel <b>axle</b> <b>boxes.</b> The ten-coupled wheel arrangement, in conjunction with the sharp curvature of the lines in South West, necessitated special side play for the leading coupled wheel <b>axle</b> <b>boxes</b> and spherical bearings for the leading crank pins.|$|R
50|$|<b>Axle</b> <b>box</b> guides {{traditionally}} had a guide {{cap with}} 9 holes of 5mm diameter each; however, {{in the latest}} design, the guide cap is made {{an integral part of}} the guide. Approximately 1.5 liters of dashpot oil is required per guide arrangement.|$|E
50|$|The coaches {{come to the}} {{workshop}} once in a year. During examination of these coaches, it was noticed that the Hytrel washers have not only damaged the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> housing but also the lower spring seat {{as well as the}} Protective tube.|$|E
5000|$|An {{automatic}} lubricator, is {{a device}} fitted to a steam engine to supply lubricating {{oil to the}} cylinders and, sometimes, the bearings and <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> mountings as well. [...] There are various types of automatic lubricator, which include various designs of displacement, hydrostatic and mechanical lubricators.|$|E
50|$|The piston valves were {{actuated}} by Walschaerts {{valve gear}} {{and the standard}} SAR type steam reversing gear was arranged on the right-hand side. The engine and tender were both equipped with vacuum brakes and the engine's two 21 in diameter vacuum cylinders were arranged outside the engine's frame and under the running boards, one on either side. The valve gear, brake gear and coupled wheel hubs were soft grease lubricated, while the bronze <b>axle</b> <b>boxes</b> had hard grease lubrication. The leading and trailing bogies were fitted with roller bearing <b>axle</b> <b>boxes</b> while the tender's bogies used plain bearings.|$|R
50|$|The {{side frame}} of the bogie was usually of bar construction, with simple horn guides attached, {{allowing}} the <b>axle</b> <b>boxes</b> vertical movements between them. The <b>axle</b> <b>boxes</b> had a cast-steel equaliser beam or bar resting on them. The bar had two steel coil springs placed on it and the bogie frame rested on the springs. The effect was to allow the bar {{to act as a}} compensating lever between the two axles and to use both springs to soften shocks from either axle. The bogie had a conventional bolster suspension with swing links carrying a spring plank.|$|R
