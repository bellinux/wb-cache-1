5|$|Broken Rules {{currently}} {{has no plans}} to develop a sequel to And Yet It Moves, due to the time spent on the game. Bohatsch commented that he is unopposed to the idea and is <b>amenable</b> to proposals to develop such a game.|$|E
5|$|February 1994: A team of Libyans {{attacked}} bin Laden's home in Sudan. The CIA {{investigated and}} {{reported that they had}} been hired by Saudi Arabia, but Saudi Arabia accused them of lying to make bin Laden more <b>amenable</b> to Sudanese interests.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Court of Appeal's judgment can be interpreted in one of two ways: that the exercise of a power is not <b>amenable</b> to judicial review either if it has no public element altogether, or if it has an insufficient public element. Neither of these interpretations is without complications. As regards the first interpretation, {{it may be difficult to}} conceive of an exercise of statutory power that has no public element at all. If the second interpretation is correct, there is doubt as to the level of sufficiency required for the exercise of a power to be <b>amenable</b> to judicial review as the Court did not explain this.|$|E
5|$|The timber {{is fairly}} hard and resembles silky oak (Grevillea robusta). It is durable {{and can be}} readily {{polished}} and worked with, making it <b>amenable</b> for use in furniture, picture frames and tool handles.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics have {{no effect}} against viral infections or against the viruses that cause the common cold. Due to their side effects, {{antibiotics}} cause overall harm but are still frequently prescribed. Some {{of the reasons that}} antibiotics are so commonly prescribed include people's expectations for them, physicians' desire to help, and the difficulty in excluding complications that may be <b>amenable</b> to antibiotics. There are no effective antiviral drugs for the common cold even though some preliminary research has shown benefits.|$|E
5|$|For {{functioning}} tumors, the somatostatin analog {{class of}} medications, such as octreotide, {{can reduce the}} excessive production of hormones. Lanreotide can slow tumor growth. If the tumor is not <b>amenable</b> to surgical removal and is causing symptoms, targeted therapy with everolimus or sunitinib can reduce symptoms and slow progression of the disease. Standard cytotoxic chemotherapy is generally not very effective for PanNETs, but may be used when other drug treatments fail to prevent the disease from progressing, or in poorly differentiated PanNET cancers.|$|E
5|$|If a male is interested, he will stretch {{his neck}} and erect his feathers, then bend over and peck at the ground. He will circle around and sidle up to the female, swaying his body and neck from side to side, and rubbing his breast against his partner's rump. Often the female will reject his {{advances}} with aggression, but if <b>amenable,</b> she signals acceptance by squatting down and raising her rump.|$|E
5|$|Let Go is {{the debut}} studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne, {{released}} on 4 June 2002. For {{a year after}} signing a record deal with Arista, Lavigne struggled due to conflicts in musical direction. She relocated to Los Angeles, California, and recorded there, her earlier materials for the album; the kind of sound to which the label was not <b>amenable.</b> She was paired to the production team The Matrix, who understood her vision for the album.|$|E
5|$|Other {{possibilities}} exist, as well. For example, immunohistochemistry usually utilizes an antibody {{to one or}} more proteins {{of interest}} that are conjugated to enzymes yielding either luminescent or chromogenic signals that can be compared between samples, allowing for localization information. Another applicable technique is cofractionation in sucrose (or other material) gradients using isopycnic centrifugation. While this technique does not prove colocalization of a compartment of known density and the protein of interest, it does increase the likelihood, and is more <b>amenable</b> to large-scale studies.|$|E
5|$|Since this Life first {{appeared}} in McClure's Magazine not one important statement as of fact in it has been disproved or even seriously questioned. It {{is a product of}} much and highly intelligent labor, and were Christian Scientists open to argument or <b>amenable</b> to reason the wretched cult would not have survived its publication for a single month. It is unanswerable and conclusive, and nobody who has not read it can be considered well-informed as to the history or nature of Eddyism.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, a few units arranged ceasefires but the truces {{were not}} nearly as widespread as in 1914; this was, in part, due to strongly worded orders from the high commands of both sides prohibiting fraternisation. Soldiers were no longer <b>amenable</b> to truce by 1916. The war had become increasingly bitter after devastating human losses suffered during the battles of the Somme and Verdun, and the incorporation of poison gas.|$|E
5|$|Threshold {{issues are}} legal {{requirements}} in Singapore administrative law {{that must be}} satisfied by applicants before their claims for judicial review of acts or decisions of public authorities {{can be dealt with}} by the High Court. These include showing that they have standing (locus standi) to bring cases, and that the matters are <b>amenable</b> to judicial review and justiciable by the Court.|$|E
5|$|A PIL {{was filed}} in the Karnataka High Court where in the {{petitioner}} requested the court to issue a direction to the Ministry of Home Affairs to consider their representation dated 26 October 2012 and confer the Bharat Ratna upon Mahatma Gandhi. On 27 January 2014, a counsel appearing for the petitioner noted that after multiple representations from the petitioner, they were provided with the information under RTI that the recommendations to confer the award on Gandhi have been received multiple {{times in the past}} and were forwarded to the Prime Minister's Office. A Division bench comprising Chief Justice D.H. Waghela and Justice B.V. Nagarathna dismissed the petition stating that the subject is not <b>amenable</b> to any adjudication process and the nominations and conferment process is stated to be informal and in the discretion of the highest authority in the Government.|$|E
5|$|Although greatly {{obstructed}} by Ranavalona's policies, French and British {{political interests}} in Madagascar remained undiminished. Divisions between traditionalist and pro-European factions at the queen's court created opportunities that European intermediaries exploited {{in an attempt}} to hasten the succession of Ranavalona's son, Radama II. The young prince disagreed with many of his mother's policies and was <b>amenable</b> to French proposals for the exploitation of the island's resources, as expressed in the Lambert Charter he concluded with a French representative in 1855. These plans were never successful, however, and Radama II was not to take the throne until 1861, when Ranavalona died aged 83.|$|E
5|$|Analysis is the {{activity}} of breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts {{in order to understand}} it. Reductionism can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach. One type of reductionism is the belief that all fields of study are ultimately <b>amenable</b> to scientific explanation. Perhaps a historical event might be explained in sociological and psychological terms, which in turn might be described in terms of human physiology, which in turn might be described in terms of chemistry and physics. Daniel Dennett distinguishes legitimate reductionism from what he calls greedy reductionism, which denies real complexities and leaps too quickly to sweeping generalizations.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics are {{not usually}} used for gastroenteritis, {{although}} they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected. If antibiotics are to be employed, a macrolide (such as azithromycin) is preferred over a fluoroquinolone due to higher rates {{of resistance to the}} latter. Pseudomembranous colitis, usually caused by antibiotic use, is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and treating it with either metronidazole or vancomycin. Bacteria and protozoans that are <b>amenable</b> to treatment include Shigella Salmonella typhi, and Giardia species. In those with Giardia species or Entamoeba histolytica, tinidazole treatment is recommended and superior to metronidazole. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of antibiotics in young children who have both bloody diarrhea and fever.|$|E
5|$|Around late 1224 {{or early}} 1225, Alice married Bohemond, eldest son of Bohemond IV, Prince of Antioch and Count of Tripoli. Pope Honorius ordered Eustorgius, Archbishop of Nicosia, to inquire into the {{legality}} of the marriage. Alice, who continued to regard herself as regent, wanted to appoint her new husband as bailli, but this appointment was opposed by all Cypriot barons. Alice then offered the office to Aimery Barlais, who was <b>amenable,</b> but the High Court ruled that Alice could not replace Philip of Ibelin who had been made bailli for the duration of her son's minority. Barlais left the island to join Alice, while his supporter, Gavin of Chenichy visited with the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick II, who had decided to launch a crusade for the Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|As the {{rationalisation}} programme was winding down, Sjarifuddin began gathering {{soldiers from}} the Socialist Party, Communist Party, {{and members of the}} All Indonesia Centre of Labour Organizations for a would-be proletarian revolution in Madiun, East Java, which occurred on 18September 1948. Sudirman, ill at the time, sent Nasution to deal with the revolution; Sudirman also sent two other officers as peace feelers before the attacks. Although the revolutionary leader Muso was <b>amenable</b> to peace, Nasution and his soldiers had quashed the uprising by 30September. Sudirman visited Madiun not long after the battle, later telling his wife that he had been unable to sleep there for all the bloodshed.|$|E
5|$|By February 1968 Harrison {{decided to}} leave, as Cohen was showing {{no signs of}} abandoning the reprints. He resigned, and {{suggested}} Barry Malzberg to Cohen as a possible successor. Cohen knew Malzberg from {{his work at the}} Scott Meredith Literary Agency, and thought that he might be more <b>amenable</b> than Harrison to continuing the reprint policy. Malzberg took over in April 1968, but immediately came into conflict with Cohen over the reprints, and then threatened to resign in October 1968 over a disagreement about artwork Malzberg had commissioned for a cover. Cohen contacted Robert Silverberg, then the president of SFWA, and told him (falsely) that Malzberg had actually resigned. Silverberg recommended Ted White as a replacement. Cohen secured White's agreement and then fired Malzberg; White assumed control with the May 1969 issue.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s Notosusanto had {{abandoned}} his literary career, focusing instead on history. In 1960 {{he received a}} scholarship from the Rockefeller Foundation to study at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London, England. He dropped out in 1961, and returned to Indonesia in 1962. Around {{this time he was}} recruited by General Abdul Haris Nasution to provide a version of the revolution <b>amenable</b> to the Indonesian Army and counter a Communist Party of Indonesia-backed history which ignored the Madiun Affair of 1948. In 1964 he was chosen as head of the Department of Military History. He also worked as a lecturer at UI.|$|E
5|$|Cross was a Liberal, {{and fast}} {{established}} himself {{was one of}} the party's leading Edmonton lights. By some assessments, he was the second most influential Liberal in the city after Frank Oliver, the owner of the Edmonton Bulletin and local Member of Parliament. Once {{the decision was made to}} create the province of Alberta, the question emerged of who would govern it: the Northwest Territories were governed on a non-partisan basis by Premier Frederick W. A. G. Haultain, who was a Conservative in federal politics. Some Liberals, such as Peter Talbot, were <b>amenable</b> to Haultain's becoming the first Premier of Alberta, either as the head of a non-partisan government or one formed by a coalition of Liberals and Conservatives. Cross was not among them.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the advent}} of iron {{reinforced}} plows and other improved methods of crop cultivation, the regional environmental conditions placed limits on the practicality and extend of land tillage, but various grains, beans and peas were grown. The dense forest coverage {{on the other hand}} facilitated gathering and was more <b>amenable</b> to the raising of farm animals, which involved all of the major species, including in particular the small, forest type horses. The horses constituted an important element of the Baltic tribes' culture – men of the upper socioeconomic status were often buried with their horses and even together with their fancy horsemanship gear.|$|E
5|$|Henry did {{not give}} up on his hopes for a crusade, but became {{increasingly}} absorbed {{in a bid to}} acquire the wealthy Kingdom of Sicily for his son Edmund. Sicily had been controlled by Frederick II of the Holy Roman Empire, for many years a rival of Pope Innocent IV. On Frederick's death in 1250, Innocent started to look for a new ruler, one more <b>amenable</b> to the Papacy. Henry saw Sicily as both a valuable prize for his son and as an excellent base for his crusading plans in the east. With minimal consultation within his court, Henry came to an agreement with the Pope in 1254 that Edmund should be the next king. Innocent urged Henry to send Edmund with an army to reclaim Sicily from Frederick's son Manfred, offering to contribute to the expenses of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|If handled {{correctly}} {{early in}} life, guinea pigs become <b>amenable</b> to {{being picked up}} and carried, and seldom bite or scratch. They are timid explorers and often hesitate to attempt an escape from their cage even when an opportunity presents itself. Still, they show considerable curiosity when allowed to walk freely, especially in familiar and safe terrain. Guinea pigs that become familiar with their owner will whistle on the owner's approach; they will also learn to whistle {{in response to the}} rustling of plastic bags or the opening of refrigerator doors, where their food is most commonly stored. In Switzerland, owning a single guinea pig is considered harmful to its well-being and forbidden by law.|$|E
5|$|If {{investigations}} confirm NSCLC, {{the stage}} is assessed {{to determine whether the}} disease is localized and <b>amenable</b> to surgery or if it has spread {{to the point where it}} cannot be cured surgically. CT scan and positron emission tomography are used for this determination. If mediastinal lymph node involvement is suspected, the nodes may be sampled to assist staging. Techniques used for this include transthoracic needle aspiration, transbronchial needle aspiration (with or without endobronchial ultrasound), endoscopic ultrasound with needle aspiration, mediastinoscopy, and thoracoscopy. Blood tests and pulmonary function testing are used to assess whether a person is well enough for surgery. If pulmonary function tests reveal poor respiratory reserve, surgery may not be possible.|$|E
5|$|In January 2000, Ferraro and Lynn Martin—a former Republican Congresswoman and U.S. Secretary of Labor who {{had played}} Ferraro in George H. W. Bush's debate {{preparations}} in 1984—co-founded, and served as co-presidents of, G Strategies, a management consulting firm underneath Weber McGinn. Its goal was to advise corporations on how to develop more women leaders and make their workplaces more <b>amenable</b> to female employees. G Strategies subsequently became part of Golin Harris International. In , Ferraro was made {{executive vice president and}} managing director of the public affairs practice of the Global Consulting Group, an international investor relations and corporate communications component of Huntsworth. There she worked with corporations, non-profit organizations, state governments and political figures. She continued there as a senior advisor working about two days a month.|$|E
5|$|Lancaster’s main ally was Guy Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. Warwick was {{the most}} fervently and {{consistently}} antagonistic of the earls, and remained so until his early death in 1315. Other earls were more <b>amenable.</b> Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, was Gaveston’s brother-in-law and stayed loyal to the king. Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, would later {{be one of the}} king’s most central supporters, yet at this point he found the most prudent course of action was {{to go along with the}} reformers. Of the barons, at least Robert Clifford and William Marshall seemed to have royalist leanings.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{relationship}} between Lie and Gerhardsen grew cooler. Gerhardsen was becoming far more <b>amenable</b> to the Soviets {{in part due to}} the influence of his wife, Werna, who was highly sympathetic to the Soviet Union (some even claiming she was a KGB informant). Gerhardsen had grown more and more frustrated at Lie's hard-line tactics against communists and perceived Soviet sympathisers, as well as his attempts to stifle foreign policy debate within the Central Committee. Lie on his part grew embittered over what he perceived was the Gerhardsen-couple protecting key leftists, such as Trygve Bull. According to Bull, Lie and Gerhardsen hardly spoke to each other after 1957.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1907, Kafka {{was hired}} at the , an {{insurance}} company, {{where he worked}} for nearly a year. His correspondence during that period indicates that he was unhappy with a working time schedule—from 08:00 until 18:00—making it extremely difficult to concentrate on writing, which was assuming increasing importance to him. On 15 July 1908, he resigned. Two weeks later he found employment more <b>amenable</b> to writing {{when he joined the}} Worker's Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia. The job involved investigating and assessing compensation for personal injury to industrial workers; accidents such as lost fingers or limbs were commonplace at this time owing to poor work safety policies at the time. It was especially true of factories fitted with machine lathes, drills, planing machines and rotary saws which were rarely fitted with safety guards.|$|E
5|$|On 3 or 4January 1644, {{the five}} leading dissenting brethren signalled {{a break with}} the rest of the Assembly when they {{published}} An Apologeticall Narration, a polemical pamphlet appealing to Parliament. It argued that the congregational system was more <b>amenable</b> to state control of religious matters than that of the presbyterians because they did not desire the church to retain any real power except to withdraw fellowship from aberrant congregations. By 17January, the majority of the Assembly had become convinced that the best way forward was a presbyterian system similar to that of the Scots, but the dissenting brethren were allowed to continue to state their case in hope that they could eventually be reconciled. It was hoped that by avoiding asserting that presbyterianism was established by divine right, the congregationalists could be accommodated.|$|E
5|$|Ornamentation {{assumes a}} preeminent role {{in much of}} Sorabji's music. His {{harmonic}} language, which frequently combines tonal and atonal elements, is thus freer than in the music of many other composers and less <b>amenable</b> to analysis. Like many other 20th-century composers, Sorabji displays a fondness for tritone and semitone relationships. The opening gesture of his Fourth Piano Sonata, for example, emphasises these two intervals, and the two long pedal points in its third movement are a tritone apart. However, some people have remarked that his music rarely contains the tension that is commonly associated with very dissonant music.|$|E
5|$|Recently, {{contention}} arose {{over what}} kind of institution the Hurva would be. Secularist and nationalist-religious activists opposed the notion of another synagogue in the Old City and wanted the site to become a museum presenting the historical saga of the Jewish Quarter and displaying archaeological finds unearthed there. They viewed the appointment of Kook as the rabbi while the structure was still a shell as a move aimed at preventing a Modern Orthodox rabbi, {{who would have been}} more <b>amenable</b> to a broader utilisation of the site, from getting the position. Rabbi of the Jewish Quarter, Avigdor Nebenzahl, has been clear that he wants the building to serve as a synagogue and a house of study.|$|E
5|$|The {{dynamic of}} the {{conclave}} was divided between the French Angevin cardinals, mostly created by Pope Urban IV, who were <b>amenable</b> to an invasion of Italy by Charles of Anjou, and the non-French (mostly Italian) cardinals whose numbers were just sufficient to prevent a French pope from being elected. Clement IV's crowning of Charles of Anjou as King of Naples and Sicily, previously a papal fief, had cemented {{the influence of the}} French monarchy in the Italian peninsula and created an intense division within the College of Cardinals between those who opposed and supported French influence, and by extension, ultramontanism. Conradin, the last ruler of the House of Hohenstaufen, had been beheaded in Naples just a month before the death of Clement IV.|$|E
5|$|The {{first serious}} {{allegation}} against Pleydell in the Star Chamber concerned the forced expulsion of an occupant of the manor house at East Grafton, Somerset in late 1553. He {{was accused of}} assisting John Berwick in the original infringement and composing an <b>amenable</b> jury in Marlborough to avoid conviction. Both were found innocent of breaching the peace and claimed to have acted at the reasonable request of their employer, Anne Seymour; undue interference with judicial proceedings was ruled out. Around the same time, Pleydell was sued for forcible entry and illegal seizure of property at Little Bedwyn (with similar offences at Collingbourne Ducis) but claimed to be acting on {{the failure of the}} plaintiff to punctually pay rent.|$|E
5|$|The {{major factors}} {{influencing}} diving safety are the environment, the diving {{equipment and the}} performance of the diver and the dive team. The underwater environment is alien, both physically and psychologically stressful, and usually not <b>amenable</b> to control, though divers can be selective in the conditions in which they are willing to dive. The other factors must be controlled to mitigate the overall stress on the diver and allow the dive to be completed in acceptable safety. The equipment is critical to diver safety for life support, but is generally reliable, controllable and predictable in its performance.|$|E
5|$|There remains some {{uncertainty}} {{whether the}} source test or nature test {{ought to be}} the determining test. It appears, though, that the impact of Datafin remains qualified in the light of other decisions where the source of the power was held to be the determining factor. It is also worth noting that the effect of the nature test is greatly restricted in practice due to the insistence on the difference between contractual and governmental powers. Where there is a contractual relationship between an aggrieved person and the body making a decision affecting the person, this tends to place the dispute on the private law side of the public–private divide, making the decision not <b>amenable</b> to judicial review.|$|E
