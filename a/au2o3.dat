25|$|Gold is a {{soft metal}} (MH 2.5–3) that is easily deformed. It has a {{close-packed}} face-centred cubic structure (BCN 12). The chemistry of gold {{is dominated by}} its +3 valence state; all such compounds of gold feature covalent bonding, as do its stable +1 compounds. Gold oxide (<b>Au2O3)</b> is amphoteric, with acidic properties predominating; it forms anionic hydroxoaurates M where M = Na, K, Ba, Tl; and aurates such as NaAuO2. Gold is a constituent of Zintl phases such as M2AuBi (M = Li or Na); Li2AuM (M = In, Tl, Ge, Pb, Sn) and Ca5Au4.|$|E

40|$|Chemical {{reactions}} are always associated with electronic structure {{changes of the}} involved chemical species. Determining the electronic configuration of an atom allows probing its chemical state and gives understanding of the reaction pathways. However, often the {{reactions are}} too complex and too fast to be measured at in situ conditions due to slow and/or insensitive experimental techniques. A short-lived Au₂O compound has been detected {{for the first time}} under in situ conditions during the temperature-programmed reduction of <b>Au₂O₃.</b> A time-resolved resonant inelastic X-ray scattering experiment (RIXS) allowed the determination of changes in the Au electronic structure, enabling {{a better understanding of the}} reaction mechanism of Au(III) reduction. On the basis of time-resolved RIXS data analysis combined with genetic algorithm methodology, we determined the electronic structure of the metastable Au₂O intermediate species. The data analysis showed a notably larger value for the lattice constant of the intermediate Au as compared to the theoretical predictions. With support of DFT calculations, we found that such a structure may indeed be formed and that the expanded lattice constant is due to the termination of Au₂O on the <b>Au₂O₃</b> structure. during <b>Au₂O₃</b> Reductio...|$|E
