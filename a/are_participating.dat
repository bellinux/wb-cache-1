5|$|Two {{different}} kelly pool-based derivations for {{behind the}} eight ball {{are provided in}} diverse sources. As noted, in kelly pool each player is randomly assigned a specific ball of the fifteen ball rack, which must be made in numerical order. The game ends when any player makes his assigned ball. Based on these rules, one origin theory holds that when {{a large number of}} players <b>are</b> <b>participating,</b> players assigned balls numerically higher than 8that is, balls that are behind the 8 ball in orderhave little chance of winning. This {{is a result of the}} likelihood that random distribution will result in multiple players with assigned balls numbered lower than 8 having an opportunity to shoot first, and that with such large a number of players at least one will come to the table with the opportunity to shoot at his assigned ball.|$|E

500|$|The {{proposal}} of using criminal sanctions to enforce attendance under this new system was opposed by MPs {{from both the}} Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, who believed compulsion and threats were the wrong approach to increasing participation.

[...] However, the Prime Minister's Queen's Speech in November 2007, which discussed the raise in school leaving age, suggested that pupils who failed to comply with new laws are to be expected to face fines or community service, rather than custodial sentencing which had previously been proposed. Local Authorities will also be expected to ensure pupils <b>are</b> <b>participating</b> up to 18 years of age.|$|E

500|$|Over 200 {{countries}} and 3,600 athletes {{participated in the}} inaugural 2010 Youth Summer Olympics.

[...] A certain number of spots in each event are to be left open for athletes from under-represented nations regardless of qualifying marks. [...] This is to ensure that every nation will be able to send at least four athletes to each Youth Olympic Games. [...] For team tournaments one team per continent will be allowed to compete along with a sixth team either representing the host nation or as proposed by the IF with IOC approval. [...] There is a cap of two teams (one boys' and one girls') per nation. [...] Finally, no nation may enter more than 70 athletes in individual sports.|$|E
