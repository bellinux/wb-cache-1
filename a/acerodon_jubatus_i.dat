50|$|The {{results support}} {{that the primary}} food group is {{composed}} of fig species. F. subcordata, known by the local name payapa, {{was found in the}} stool of the bats. Unidentified leave compositions were also found to be in the droppings of <b>Acerodon</b> <b>jubatus.</b> Figs are a dietary stable and also a keystone resource for the <b>Acerodon</b> <b>jubatus.</b> Whether this food group is important in their conservation is up for debate. There is a lack of consensus on whether items deemed important are actually prioritized or found as an alternative food for these bats.|$|R
50|$|The primary diet of <b>Acerodon</b> <b>jubatus</b> is {{composed}} of figs and leaves from the lowland forests of the Philippine Islands. This was determined by fecal analysis on the bats near Subic Bay, West Central Luzon. Seeds were present in both species of <b>Acerodon</b> <b>jubatus</b> and Pteropus Vampyrus Lanesis. Both species generally select separate trees or distinct areas within a shared canopy to roost. Droppings were then collected separately, screened, and examined. The seeds of the droppings were examined and classified using field guides and lexicons. Dietary items were deemed important if they were consistently eaten, ubiquitous across the population, and of clear nutritional value.|$|R
5000|$|The giant golden-crowned {{flying fox}} is {{threatened}} by deforestation and has completely disappeared from many islands in the Philippines, such as Panay and most of Cebu. The extinct Panay populations were once considered a separate species, the Panay giant fruit bat (Acerodon lucifer), but is now included under <b>Acerodon</b> <b>jubatus.</b> Due to their size, the species is easily hunted. [...] The species is not only hunted because of their size, {{but also because of}} the availability of licenses; although the species is endangered, they are still able to be hunted for sport and consumption when spotted outside of their roosts. One obvious way to facilitate conservation would be to lower the number of, if not get rid of entirely, the number of hunting licenses allowing the hunting of <b>Acerodon</b> <b>Jubatus</b> outside of roosts.|$|R
50|$|<b>Acerodon</b> <b>jubatus</b> {{probably}} flies {{long distances}} to feed because of deforestation and habitat loss. On Maripipi, bats were observed commuting at least 12 km to foraging sites on Biliran. Foraging distances {{could be as}} far as 20 or 30 km away. This means that the bats spend time outside of protected areas, increasing their chance of being killed.|$|R
50|$|Multiple {{types of}} figs can also {{contribute}} to different nutrients for the <b>Acerodon</b> <b>jubatus.</b> Frugivorous bats usually do not consume foods rich in protein. The overconsumption of fruits, paired with leaves may contribute to an adequate amount of protein in their diet. Figs are superior sources of calcium, which may also aid in their growth to adults.|$|R
50|$|Agencies {{promoting}} {{the conservation of}} this species include Bat Conservation International, the Wildlife Conservation Society, the World Wildlife fund, Lubee Foundation and others. They provide research funding and education worldwide as well as locally. In India they have started a research center in Hyderabad. Education focused on conservation would help protect species, such as <b>Acerodon</b> <b>jubatus,</b> get more attention and resources.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Acerodon</b> <b>jubatus</b> also {{aids in the}} {{regeneration}} of the forest. By {{eating the}} fruits of the lowlands, they disperse seeds across the islands through their droppings. This maintains and increases plant diversity across the Philippines. Bats may also be in the few species that act as pollinators and seed dispersers of these plants. By hunting these bats, there is a significant threat to their populations, as well as environments.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{a number}} of {{interesting}} animals that inhabit the area in and around Abaga Falls. The most notable include; the endangered Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi) also commonly known as the [...] "monkey-eating eagle", the rufous hornbill (Buceros hydrocorax), the endangered giant golden-crowned flying fox (<b>Acerodon</b> <b>jubatus)</b> which can only be found in the Philippines, and the Philippine flying lemur (Cynocephalus volans). Many of these animals are either near extinction or in danger of losing their habitats due to human activities.|$|R
50|$|The giant golden-crowned {{flying fox}} (<b>Acerodon</b> <b>jubatus),</b> {{also known as}} the golden-capped fruit bat, is a rare megabat and one of the largest bats in the world. The species is {{endangered}} and is currently facing the possibility of extinction because of poaching and forest destruction. It is endemic to forests in the Philippines. The bat can reach up to 1.2 kg in weight and 1.7 m in wingspan. Like other megabats, this species is non-aggressive towards humans and is frugivorous. Even though they are not aggressive, handling the bat without proper training and vaccination is dangerous, as some can carry deadly diseases.|$|R
500|$|Bats {{are present}} {{throughout}} most of the world, with the exception of extremely cold regions. They perform the vital ecological roles of pollinating flowers and dispersing fruit seeds; many tropical plant species depend entirely on bats for the distribution of their seeds. Bats are economically important, as they consume insect pests, reducing the need for pesticides. The smallest bat, and arguably the smallest extant mammal, is Kitti's hog-nosed bat, measuring [...] in length, [...] across the wings and [...] in mass. The largest bats are a few species of Pteropus (fruit bats or flying foxes) and the giant golden-crowned flying fox, <b>Acerodon</b> <b>jubatus,</b> with a weight up to [...] and wingspan up to [...]|$|R
50|$|The {{forest of}} Mount Mariveles where the waterfalls are located {{contains}} many dipterocarps, orchids, and vines and other plant species including tsaang gubat. Various species of fungi growing in tree trunks have been documented. There {{are a number}} of interesting animals that inhabit the slopes of Mount Mariveles where the three waterfalls are located. The most notable include: the Japanese sparrowhawk, the endangered Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi) commonly known as the “monkey-eating eagle", the Philippine eagle owl, the rufous hornbill (Buceros hydrocorax) locally known as kalaw, the endangered giant golden-crowned flying fox (<b>Acerodon</b> <b>jubatus),</b> which can only be found in the Philippines. Philippine deer (erroneously reported by some as wild goats) and crab-eating macaques were also recently spotted in the area.|$|R
50|$|The large {{flying fox}} (P. vampyrus) is {{generally}} reported {{as the largest}} Pteropus, but a few other species may match it, {{at least in some}} measurements. The large flying fox has a wingspan up to 1.5 m and five individuals weighed 0.65 - 1.1 kg. Even greater weights, up to 1.6 kg and 1.45 kg, have been reported for the Indian flying fox (P. giganteus) and great flying fox (P. neohibernicus), respectively. The black-bearded flying fox (P. melanopogon) is massive and may be heavier than all other megabats, but exact weight data are not available. Comparably, no full wingspan measurements are available for the great flying fox (P. neohibernicus), but with a forearm length up to 206 mm, it may even surpass the large flying fox (P. vampyrus) where the forearm is up to 200 mm. Outside this genus, the giant golden-crowned flying fox (<b>Acerodon</b> <b>jubatus)</b> is the only bat with similar dimensions.|$|R
40|$|Background: In 2008 - 09, {{evidence}} of Reston ebolavirus (RESTV) infection {{was found in}} domestic pigs and pig workers in the Philippines. With species of bats having {{been shown to be}} the cryptic reservoir of filoviruses elsewhere, the Philippine government, in conjunction with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, assembled a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional team to investigate Philippine bats as the possible reservoir of RESTV. Methods: The team undertook surveillance of bat populations at multiple locations during 2010 using both serology and molecular assays. Results: A total of 464 bats from 21 species were sampled. We found both molecular and serologic {{evidence of}} RESTV infection in multiple bat species. RNA was detected with quantitative PCR (qPCR) in oropharyngeal swabs taken from Miniopterus schreibersii, with three samples yielding a product on conventional hemi-nested PCR whose sequences differed from a Philippine pig isolate by a single nucleotide. Uncorroborated qPCR detections may indicate RESTV nucleic acid in several additional bat species (M. australis, C. brachyotis and Ch. plicata). We also detected anti-RESTV antibodies in three bats (<b>Acerodon</b> <b>jubatus)</b> using both Western blot and ELISA. Conclusions: The findings suggest that ebolavirus infection is taxonomically widespread in Philippine bats, but the evident low prevalence and low viral load warrants expanded surveillance to elaborate the findings, and more broadly, to determine the taxonomic and geographic occurrence of ebolaviruses in bats in the region. © 2015 Jayme et al...|$|R
40|$|Species of Old World fruit-bats (family Pteropodidae) {{have been}} {{identified}} as the natural hosts of a number of novel and highly pathogenic viruses threatening livestock and human health. We used GPS data loggers to record the nocturnal foraging movements of <b>Acerodon</b> <b>jubatus,</b> the Golden-crowned flying fox in the Philippines to better understand the landscape utilisation of this iconic species, with the dual objectives of pre-empting disease emergence and supporting conservation management. Data loggers were deployed on eight of 54 A. jubatus (two males and six females) captured near Subic Bay on the Philippine island of Luzon between 22 November and 2 December 2010. Bodyweight ranged from 730 g to 1002 g, translating to a weight burden of 3 - 4 % of bodyweight. Six of the eight loggers yielded useful data over 2 - 10 days, showing variability in the nature and range of individual bat movements. The majority of foraging locations were in closed forest and most were remote from evident human activity. Forty-six discrete foraging locations and five previously unrecorded roost locations were identified. Our findings indicate that foraging is not a random event, with the majority of bats exhibiting repetitious foraging movements night-to-night, that apparently intact forest provides the primary foraging resource, and that known roost locations substantially underestimate the true number (and location) of roosts. Our initial findings support policy and decision-making across perspectives including landscape management, species conservation, and potentially disease emergence...|$|R
40|$|Many {{species of}} large flying foxes are endangered, mainly due to habitat loss and hunting. Although hunting and logging are {{prohibited}} {{in many areas}} in the Old World Tropics, numbers of flying foxes are still decreasing. The best compromise {{for the welfare of}} both local residents and flying foxes in many areas would be ecotourism. However, the effect of human activities on the welfare of flying foxes is unknown and needs to be investigated. Using non-invasive methods, stress levels of three species of flying foxes (Pteropus vampyrus, Pteropus hypomelanus and the endangered <b>Acerodon</b> <b>jubatus)</b> in two tourist areas in the Philippines were investigated, Boracay with little human activity, and Mambukal with intense and large variations in human activities. Fecal samples were collected in the most disturbed area, Mambukal, while the flying foxes were out foraging and concentrations of glucocorticoid metabolites (GCM) were measured. Stress-related as well as other types of behavior, environmental conditions and human activities were measured. The results suggest that flying foxes have habituated to the presence of humans. (1) We found no overall differences in behaviors between both study sites, which differed significantly in human numbers and activities, and during days with disturbance and days without disturbance. Flying foxes behaved identical in both study sites. (2) No behavior correlated with measured GCM. (3) Despite the large variation in human activities in the study site, we found no effect of human activities on glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations. However, GCM was lower {{in the center of the}} colony than in the periphery. (4) Some environmental factors like disturbance and distance from the colony center had an effect on behavioral factors like 'uneasiness', 'body care' and yawning. If disturbance has no effect on flying fox stress levels, ecotourism would be a good solution to preserve the habitat of endangered flying foxes. However, one has to realize that the influence of human presence on bat behavior might be more complex than outlined in this study which is based on visible bahaviors, and that disturbance should always be kept at a minimum. ...|$|R
40|$|Determining diets of {{pinnipeds}} by visually identifying prey remains {{recovered in}} faecal samples is challenging because {{of differences in}} digestion and passage rates of hard parts. Analyzing the soft matrix of faecal material using DNA-based techniques is an alternative means to identify prey species consumed, but published techniques are largely non-quantitative, which limits their applicability. I developed and validated a real-time PCR technique using species-specific mitochondrial DNA primers to quantify the diets of Steller sea lions (Eumetopias <b>jubatus).</b> <b>I</b> first demonstrated that the proportions of prey tissue DNA in mixtures of DNA isolated from four prey species could be estimated within a margin of ~ 12 % of the percent in the mix. These prey species included herring Clupea palasii, eulachon Thaleichthyes pacificus, squid Loligo opalescens and rosethorn rockfish Sebastes helvomaculatus. I then applied real-time PCR to DNA extracted from faecal samples obtained from Steller sea lions that had been fed 11 different combinations of herring, eulachon, squid and Pacific ocean perch rockfish (Sebastes alutus), ranging from 7 - 75 % contributions to a meal mix (by wet weight). The difference between the average percentage estimated by real-time PCR {{and the percentage of}} prey consumed was generally less than 12 % for all diets fed when percentages of prey consumed were corrected for differences in mtDNA density among the prey items. My findings indicate that real-time PCR can detect the quantity of prey consumed for a variety of complex diets and prey species, including cephalopods and fish. i...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Biology, 1986. A {{population}} of Eumetopias jubatus and Zalophus californianus was studied during the summers of 1983 and 1984 {{on the coast}} of Humboldt County. The {{population of}} E. jubatus and Z. californianus peaked during June and August. Z. californianus numbers peaked again during September. The E. jubatus population probably formed an incipient breeding colony. During June a territorial bull showed sexual interest toward cows and attempted copulation. No pupping was observed. Sea lions moved to drier areas on the study site when tidal height and ocean surge inundated haul-out areas. E. <b>jubatus</b> and <b>I.</b> californianus formed segregated clusters when hauling out. Behavioral interactions between the two species were generally not aggressive. As colony size increased, rate of behavioral interactions decreased. Four age-sex classes of E. jubatus were examined. Old Bulls were highly aggressive toward other Old Bulls, used visual displays of aggression toward Sub-adult Bulls, and showed frequent sexual interest toward Cows. Sub-adult Bulls mock-fought frequently and were highly aggressive among themselves. They displayed a weak sexual interest toward Cows but were usually rebuffed. Cows and Juveniles were usually non-aggressive. Individual E. jubatus did not frequently respond to other sea lions. Such behavior may result from sea lion iii lethargy, or may be an adaptation whereby subordinates avoid antagonizing dominants. Moving E. jubatus also frequently avoided behavioral interactions...|$|R
