40|$|People {{can learn}} complex {{concepts}} with remarkably little data. The key factor to this incredible learning ability is the “intelligent ” choice of an inductive bias that allows humans to make powerful generalizations. As a consequence, {{in the machine}} learning community, {{one of the hardest}} and most fundamental problems is how to delineate a learner’s inductive learning process, particularly how can human generalize concepts reasonably from only a few positive examples. I begin this thesis by considering <b>a</b> simple <b>next</b> <b>number</b> game—given <b>a</b> sequence of numbers, come up with the <b>next</b> <b>number.</b> On this simple task, human can eliminate their possible hypothesis space from infinite many to a single one, which reveals the process of how human generalizing from little data and the cognitive bias for solving math problems.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a fully unsupervised and automated method for large-scale extraction of multiword expressions (MWEs) from large corpora. The method aims at capturing the non-compositionality of MWEs; the intuition {{is that a}} noun within a MWE cannot easily {{be replaced by a}} semantically similar noun. To implement this intuition, a noun clustering is automatically extracted (using distributional similarity measures), which gives us clusters of semantically related nouns. <b>Next,</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of statistical measures – based on selectional preferences – is developed that formalize the intuition of non-compositionality.

40|$|Two main {{functions}} of evaluation are to enable accountability and collective learning. Both of these – and their combination – run into divers complications when applied in complex multi-actor policy processes.
