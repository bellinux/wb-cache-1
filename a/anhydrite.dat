40|$|Storage of CO 2 and, in particular, {{geological}} {{storage is}} one of the most promising solutions to counteract the continued increase of anthropogenic greenhouse-gas emissions. Here we present a multidisciplinary study of a natural CO 2 geologic reservoir where fluid overpressure, measured at 85 % of the lithostatic load, is trapped at similar to 4700 m depth in the Northern Apennines of Italy. Deep borehole data and seismic reflection profiles show that the observed CO 2 overpressure: (a) is hosted in dome shaped structures that are the result of the interplay between the compressional and extensional tectonic phases of the area and (b) occurs within dolostones that are sealed by Ca-sulphates (<b>anhydrites)</b> horizons. Field studies on outcropping evaporites, that represent exhumed analogues of the lithologies found at depth in the pressurized reservoir, show dolostones affected by fracturing and faulting and Ca-sulphates characterized by ductile folding without macroscopic fractures. Borehole and laboratory P-wave velocities coincide for <b>anhydrites</b> (6. 2 - 6. 3 km/s) but are different for dolostones (6. 2 - 6. 3 km/s in situ and similar to 7. 2 km/s in lab), confirming the different mode of deformation in the two rock types. Since <b>anhydrites</b> are not dominated by fractures, the very low permeability values, similar to 10 (- 19) to similar to 10 (- 22) m(2), recorded in laboratory experiments, can also be representative for in situ conditions. These data confirm the sealing ability of the <b>anhydrites</b> also for high values of fluid pressure. The integration of these datasets suggests that: (1) tectonics and structural position, and (2) lithology and associated mode of deformation, play a key role for channelling and trapping deep-seated CO 2 -rich crustal fluids.

40|$|The Triassic Evaporites (TE) of the Umbria-Marche Apennines, a {{sedimentary}} succession {{made up of}} {{a sequence}} of alternating sulphates (<b>anhydrites</b> and gypsum) and dolostones, represent a key lithology in terms of sealing properties and earthquake triggering. Here we: (1) report laboratory measurements of density, porosity, Vp, Vs, seismic anisotropy and permeability at effective confining pressures from 0 to 100 MPa, conducted on samples of TE collected from both outcrops and boreholes; and (2) attempt to upscale the laboratory results to larger scale geophysical investigation, such as Vp sonic logs, seismic tomography and in situ measurements of pore-fluid pressure. The average laboratory P-wave velocity is 6. 0 km/s for dolostones, 4. 6 km/s for gypsum-dolostones and 5. 8 km/s for <b>anhydrites,</b> at ambient pressure. As effective confining pressure is increased up to 100 MPa, the average P-wave velocity increases to 7. 0 km/s for dolostones, 5. 3 km/s for gypsum and 6. 4 km/s for <b>anhydrites.</b> Vp/Vs ratios appear to be independent of confining pressure, with average values of ~ 1. 8 to ~ 2. 2 for sulphates and ~ 1. 9 to ~ 2. 2 for dolostones, respectively, for dry and saturated conditions. All samples are characterized by very low permeability (10 - 18 m 2 to 10 - 21 m 2), with the higher values for gypsum-dolostones and fractured dolostones samples. The Vp profiles obtained from ultrasonic laboratory measurements match well the in situ Vp profiles measured using sonic logs. In the laboratory, the Vp/Vs ratio increases when pressurized pore fluids are present, in agreement with 4 D seismic tomography that relates the increase in Vp/Vs ratio to the migration of fluids during the 1997 Umbria-Marche seismic sequence (Mmax~ 6. 0) that nucleates within the TE.

40|$|Recently, in the Northern Apennines, {{geophysical}} {{data have}} identified the Triassic Evaporites (TE, <b>anhydrites</b> and dolomites) as the source region of the major extensional earthquakes of the area (M- 6). In order to characterize fault zone architecture and deformation processes within the TE, we have studied exhumed evaporite-bearing normal faults within the upper crust. The structure of large displacement (> 100 m) normal faults is given by 1) a zoned fault core with a wider portion of fault-parallel foliated Ca-sulphates (ductile deformation), overprinted by an inner fault core (IFC) of localized brittle deformation, and 2) wide (dolostones) to absent (Ca-sulphates) damage zones of fault fracture patterns. Fault rock assemblage within the IFC is characterized by fault breccia, gouge, and cataclasites of different grain size. Most of the deformation within the IFC is localized along thin and fault parallel principal slip surfaces (PSS) made of dolomite-rich fine-grained cataclasite. SEM analyses show an evolution from Ca- to St- to gypsum-rich mineralization, due to episodic fluid flow events channeled along the fault zones during different stages of fault exhumation. The development of the observed fault geometry {{can be explained by}} a mechanical fault evolution model where initial faulting occurs along broad and ductile shear zones within the <b>anhydrites</b> and causes fracturing within the dolostones. Progressive deformation within the fault core leads to the development of fault parallel dolomite-rich cataclastic layers. Their reactivation coupled with transient fluid overpressures can produce embrittlement and localization of brittle deformation within the IFC. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union...|$|R
25|$|Fly ash {{material}} solidifies while {{suspended in}} the exhaust gases and is collected by electrostatic precipitators or filter bags. Since the particles solidify rapidly while {{suspended in the}} exhaust gases, fly ash particles are generally spherical in shape and {{range in size from}} 0.5 µm to 300µm. The major consequence of the rapid cooling is that few minerals have time to crystallize, and that mainly amorphous, quenched glass remains. Nevertheless, some refractory phases in the pulverized coal do not melt (entirely), and remain crystalline. In consequence, fly ash is a heterogeneous material. SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3 and occasionally CaO are the main chemical components present in fly ashes. The mineralogy of fly ashes is very diverse. The main phases encountered are a glass phase, together with quartz, mullite and the iron oxides hematite, magnetite and/or maghemite. Other phases often identified are cristobalite, <b>anhydrite,</b> free lime, periclase, calcite, sylvite, halite, portlandite, rutile and anatase. The Ca-bearing minerals anorthite, gehlenite, akermanite and various calcium silicates and calcium aluminates identical to those found in Portland cement can be identified in Ca-rich fly ashes.|$|E
25|$|The sulfate {{minerals}} all {{contain the}} sulfate anion, 2−. They {{tend to be}} transparent to translucent, soft, and many are fragile. Sulfate minerals commonly form as evaporites, where they precipitate out of evaporating saline waters; alternative, sulfates {{can also be found}} in hydrothermal vein systems associated with sulfides, or as oxidation products of sulfides. Sulfates can be subdivided into anhydrous and hydrous minerals. The most common hydrous sulfate by far is gypsum, CaSO4⋅2H2O. It forms as an evaporite, and is associated with other evaporites such as calcite and halite; if it incorporates sand grains as it crystallizes, gypsum can form desert roses. Gypsum has very low thermal conductivity and maintains a low temperature when heated as it loses that heat by dehydrating; as such, gypsum is used as an insulator in materials such as plaster and drywall. The anhydrous equivalent of gypsum is anhydrite; it can form directly from seawater in highly arid conditions. The barite group has the general formula XSO4, where the X is a large 12-coordinated cation. Examples include barite (BaSO4), celestine (SrSO4), and anglesite (PbSO4); <b>anhydrite</b> {{is not part of the}} barite group, as the smaller Ca2+ is only in eight-fold coordination.|$|E
25|$|To {{achieve the}} desired setting qualities in the {{finished}} product, a quantity (2–8%, but typically 5%) of calcium sulfate (usually gypsum or <b>anhydrite)</b> {{is added to the}} clinker, and the mixture is finely ground to form the finished cement powder. This is achieved in a cement mill. The grinding process is controlled to obtain a powder with a broad particle size range, in which typically 15% by mass consists of particles below 5 μm diameter, and 5% of particles above 45 μm. The measure of fineness usually used is the 'specific surface area', which is the total particle surface area of a unit mass of cement. The rate of initial reaction (up to 24 hours) of the cement on addition of water is directly proportional to the specific surface area. Typical values are 320–380m2·kg−1 for general purpose cements, and 450–650m2·kg−1 for 'rapid hardening' cements. The cement is conveyed by belt or powder pump to a silo for storage. Cement plants normally have sufficient silo space for one to 20 weeks of production, depending upon local demand cycles. The cement is delivered to end users either in bags, or as bulk powder blown from a pressure vehicle into the customer's silo. In industrial countries, 80% or more of cement is delivered in bulk.|$|E

40|$|The {{geochemistry}} {{of thermal}} spring {{waters in the}} Acquasanta Terme area, located on the Adriatic side of central Italy, has been investigated in order to characterize the geothermal feeding system. The springs discharge more than 100 L/s at temperature ranging between 20 and 30 °C. They occur in a tectonic window of Mesozoic limestones in the central sector of the Acquasanta anticline within the Laga foredeep Basin. Chemical and isotopic compositions of thermal and cold fluids were investigated, most of them monitored for one year, {{in order to understand}} the thermal fluid circulation paths. The chemistry of the major elements defines the existence of Na–Cl and Ca–Cl–SO 4 2 - hot discharging waters and permits the characterization of the thermal end-member hosted in carbonate-dominated reservoir (Burano <b>Anhydrites</b> Fm–Calcare Massiccio Fm). This deep fluid is well represented by the sample T 1 and shows high temperature and electrical conductivity (EC), very stable over time, and not affected by mixing phenomena. This is also confirmed by tritium results (0 T. U.). Close to the surface at different depth, such water undergoes mixing or dilution processes with HCO 3 − rich freshwaters, driven by the complex structural setting of the area and by diffuse karst caves. This is identified as the main reason for observed compositional variations of sampled springs, and three areas affected by different mixing phenomena have been defined at the surface. The concentrations of SO 4 2 − and H 2 S suggest redox processes affecting sulfur after interaction with evaporitic formations, identified with the Burano <b>Anhydrites,</b> at the base of the Umbria–Marche sedimentary sequence (∼ 3500 -m-deep). Contribution from this reservoir is also supported by characteristic Sr isotope signature. δ 18 O and δD values indicate a meteoric origin of the thermal waters and allow estimation of an average infiltration altitude ranging between 1500 and 1700 m a. s. l. This datum, supported by structural data, suggests the Laga Mountains as the recharge area of the system. Reservoir temperature inferred by SO 4 2 −–HCO 3 −–F, Ca/Mg and SO 4 2 −/F geothermometers is about 80 °C, consistent with the geothermal gradient of the foredeep basin, and deserving further investigations for potential economic implications about this low-enthalpy geothermal area...|$|R

The values for the Messinian balatino-like gypsum, single gypsum crystals, and <b>anhydrites</b> range from 0. 70861 to 0. 70886 and are approximately 25 * 10 **- 5 less than would be expected for evaporites precipitated from Messinian seawater (0. 70891 - 0. 70902). Pre-evaporitic planktonic foraminifers from Hole 654 A show variable degrees of dolomitization and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values that irregularly decrease upward from normal marine values approximately 81 m below the lowest evaporite occurrence. This suggests diagenetic alteration by advecting interstitial water with a low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio or that the lower Sr isotopic ratios for the Messinian evaporites could have resulted from a greater influence of fresh water on the Sr isotopic composition of the desiccating Tyrrhenian Sea. Fluctuations of the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr-ratio for evaporites in the sedimentary cycles recognized for Holes 653 B and 654 A, the generally low Sr isotopic ratio of river water entering the Mediterranean Sea, {{and the presence of}} dwarf marine microfossils suggest that the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio of the evaporites responded to hydrologic variations in a very restricted basin with variable rates of marine and fresh water input. The strontium isotopic ratios of the Messinian <b>anhydrites</b> from the proposed lacustrine sequence at Hole 652 A fall in the same range as the marine evaporites from Holes 654 A and 653 B. This suggests a common or similar origin of the brines at the three locations. The complex depositional and hydrologic conditions in the Mediterranean during the Messinian salinity crisis preclude the use of Sr isotopic values from the evaporites for stratigraphic correlation and dating. They are, however, very useful in the interpretation of the depositional history of the basin. General calculations assuming a closed system suggest that the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio of Messinian seawater (- 0. 7090) could be reduced to that of the evaporites (- 0. 7087) by mixing with fresh water (e. g., Nile River) in times of 10 ** 4 to 10 ** 5 yr...|$|R
