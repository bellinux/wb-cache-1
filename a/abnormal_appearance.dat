25|$|Fetal alcohol {{spectrum}} disorders (FASDs) are a {{group of}} conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. Problems may include an <b>abnormal</b> <b>appearance,</b> short height, low body weight, small head size, poor coordination, low intelligence, behavior problems, and problems with hearing or seeing. Those affected {{are more likely to}} have trouble in school, legal problems, participate in high-risk behaviors, and have trouble with alcohol or other drugs. The most severe form of the condition is known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Other types include partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS), alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD). Some accept only FAS as a diagnosis, seeing the evidence as inconclusive with respect to other types.|$|E
25|$|The best-known case of nanism {{in ancient}} Egypt {{is that of}} the high {{official}} Seneb, as a finely-carved statue-group of the dwarf and his family has survived in excellent preservation. Seneb worked during the late 4th Dynasty (c. 26132494 BC) or early 5th Dynasty (c. 24982345 BC), most possibly under king Shepseskaf and his successors. Seneb was married to a normally grown woman named Senet-ites. He had two daughters named Awib-en-Khufu and Semeret-Radjedef and one son named Ankh-ima-Radjedef, all of whom are represented as of normal stature. This shows that it was accepted that dwarfs might have families and healthy children. Note that the two children shown in front of Seneb's seat in the accompanying illustration are in the position where the legs of a 'normal' statue would be represented, thus lessening - though not concealing - his <b>abnormal</b> <b>appearance.</b> Because Seneb's father was normally grown, Seneb's case also proves that not all dwarfs were brought from foreign countries, nanism occasionally occurring - as would be expected from modern experience - within Egyptian families. In other cases, where persons also having short stature are depicted as servants of other dwarfs, it is possible that {{they were part of the}} same family. However, this remains a matter for conjecture, as it was not uncommon during the Old Kingdom period, that artists depicted the same person multiple time in one scene. They did this to show that the main character performed several duties at the same time.|$|E

30|$|Traditionally, early post- {{gastrectomy}} imaging {{was limited}} to contrast fluoroscopy (CF) to assess anastomotic patency and integrity. More recently, multidetector CT is increasingly adopted to investigate most postoperative abdominal conditions, to comprehensively visualize the surgically altered anatomy and detect iatrogenic complications. However, compared to the literature about bariatric surgery imaging [7 – 9], few reports describe CT techniques and expected and <b>abnormal</b> <b>appearances</b> shortly after radical gastrectomy [10 – 12].|$|R
500|$|Lung AVMs may be {{suspected}} {{because of}} the <b>abnormal</b> <b>appearance</b> of the lungs on a chest X-ray, or hypoxia (low oxygen levels) on pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas determination. Bubble contrast echocardiography (bubble echo) {{may be used as}} a screening tool to identify abnormal connections between the lung arteries and veins. This involves the injection of agitated saline into a vein, followed by ultrasound-based imaging of the heart. Normally, the lungs remove small air bubbles from the circulation, and they are therefore only seen in the right atrium and the right ventricle. If an AVM is present, bubbles appear in the left atrium and left ventricle, usually 3–10 cardiac cycles after the right side; this is slower than in heart defects, in which there are direct connections between the right and left side of the heart. A larger number of bubbles is more likely to indicate the presence of an AVM. Bubble echo is not a perfect screening tool as it can miss smaller AVMs and does not identify the site of AVMs. [...] Often contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT angiography) is used to identify lung lesions; this modality has a sensitivity of over 90%. It may be possible to omit contrast administration on modern CT scanners. Echocardiography is also used if there is a suspicion of pulmonary hypertension or high-output cardiac failure due to large liver lesions, sometimes followed by cardiac catheterization to measure the pressures inside the various chambers of the heart.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe dynamic {{cracking}} arrest {{capability is}} very important for pipeline in failure control. DWTT (Drop-Weight Tear Test) is widely applied as a standard test for evaluating crack arrest characteristics of pipelines. But for high performance pipeline steel, the <b>abnormal</b> fracture <b>appearance</b> is frequently observed on fracture surface of DWTT specimens and it make DWTT technique difficult to evaluate the dynamic toughness by the current test standard. In this study, various types of DWTT specimens of a commercial API-X 70 pipeline steel were conducted at different temperature. The fracture appearances of specimens are observed. The intrinsic causes of <b>abnormal</b> fracture <b>appearance</b> are analyzed basing on the three-dimensional fracture theory. It is found that the dynamic propagation speed of crack in high performance pipeline steel is largely scattered. The propagation speed of fracture can change the three-dimensional stress constraint and lead to difference in the fracture appearance of specimen. Compress deformation, local thickness increase, toughness decrease and stress increase can make the crack dynamic propagation manner change from ductile to brittle and produce <b>abnormal</b> fracture <b>appearance.</b> The approaches to prevent or reduce the occurrence of <b>abnormal</b> fracture <b>appearance</b> for high performance pipeline steel are discussed in this paper...|$|R

We present a case of esophageal intramural pseudodiverticulosis in a 72 -year-old Caucasian man who presented with dysphagia and with a background history of alcohol abuse. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy of our patient showed an esophageal stricture with <b>abnormal</b> mucosal <b>appearances,</b> but no malignant cells were seen at biopsy.

30|$|The PPMI {{data were}} split into {{training}} and test subsets {{in such a way}} as to skew the test data towards more difficult cases. This was done due to the fact that patients were only included in the PD group if their SPECT scans displayed <b>abnormal</b> <b>appearances,</b> as assessed by the PPMI core lab team. PD patients for whom the SPECT scan was normal or equivocal were excluded from the database. This screened collection of data was therefore likely to be associated with higher visual reporting accuracy as compared to the local clinical data. To counteract this bias, more challenging cases were preferentially selected for the test set, using striatal binding ratio results as a surrogate marker of the likely difficulty in classifying the data.|$|R
30|$|Evaluation of the radiologist-CAD {{relationship}} is rarely carried out. In this study, the questionnaires provided to participating radiologists give a useful insight into CADx’s influence on decision-making {{and how it}} could be improved. The responses suggested that the CADx tool generally agreed well with the reporters’ classification decisions, with only a very limited number of disagreements. This reflects the quantitative analysis above. The classifiers mostly had a small or moderate impact on decision-making processes, which was as expected for an application where normal and <b>abnormal</b> <b>appearances</b> are often relatively easy to identify. The most common comment was that the CADx tool gave reporters added confidence in their decision, in a similar way to what might be expected from the presence of a human second reader.|$|R

30|$|An adult woman {{presented}} {{to us with}} a minor transient headache. Although no <b>abnormal</b> <b>appearances</b> were found on her scalp, imaging studies showed a club-shaped venous sac in the left parietal diploe that communicated with the superior sagittal sinus and diploic veins on the medial and lateral sides, respectively. It was revealed that the lesion had expanded as compared with a previous computed tomography image. Surgery was performed to intercept venous supply from the diploic veins, and the lesion was filled with thrombi. In a follow-up of 15  months, there was no recurrence of abnormal venous flow. Histological examination showed the endothelial lining in the membranous wall of the sac, which is typically observed in sinus pericranii. However, no communication with the pericranial veins of the scalp was identified on the imaging studies and intraoperative observation. Accordingly, it was diagnosed as another entity “intradiploic varix”.|$|R

40|$|Introduction & Background: Bone marrow is classi-fied {{into two}} types of tissues based on {{differences}} in their color at gross pathologic examination. The ac-tive hematopoietic component is comprised mostly of erythrocytes and their precursors and is denoted as "red" marrow, whereas "yellow" (inactive) marrow is comprised primarily of fat. Bone marrow is the fourth largest organ in body by weight, following bone, muscle and fat. MRI pattern of bone marrow is de-pendent on several factors including age, sex, differ-ent bones, diseases (inflammation, tumors, ischemia, trauma, and metabolic disorders), post-surgical and post-radiation changes. Progressive conversion of hematopoietic marrow to fatty marrow is seen with age. The conversion process continues until the adult pattern is reached {{by the age of}} 25 years. Here nor-mal and <b>abnormal</b> <b>appearances</b> of bone marrow in MRI.
