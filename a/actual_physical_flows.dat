The {{purpose of this study}} is to enhance sustainable learning on logistics and supply chain management through an in vitro laboratory environment in which real life supply chain structure is simulated over <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> <b>flows,</b> and also through enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, and then to measure the level of sustainability achieved. Research is conducted by including a group of students to a hands-on implementation through both physical and computerized applications in this representative business environment.

40|$|In an {{increasingly}} globalized world {{with more and}} more distributed international supply chains, sustainability studies and policies need to consider socioeconomic and environmental interactions between distant places. Studies of the global biomass metabolism investigate physical flows between and within nature and human systems, thus providing a useful basis for understanding the interrelatedness of changes in one place with impacts elsewhere. Various methodological approaches exist for studying the human-nature metabolism and estimating the land embodied in international trade flows, a core element of assessing telecouplings in the global land system. The results of recent studies vary widely, lacking robustness and thus hampering their application in policy making. This article provides a structured overview and comparative evaluation of existing accounting methods and models for calculating land footprints. We identify differences in available accounting methods and indicate their shortcomings, which are mainly attributable to the product and supply chain coverage and detail, and biases introduced by the use of monetary flows as a proxy for <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> <b>flows.</b> We suggest options for further development of global land footprint accounting methods, particularly highlighting the advantages of hybrid accounting approaches as a framework for robust and transparent assessments of the global displacement of land use...|$|E
40|$|The Circular Economy (CE) is {{currently}} a popular notion within the policy and business advocacy groups. Despite being visionary and provocative in its message, the research on the CE concept is emerging. The two intertwined objectives of the paper are; first to identify, discuss and develop the various definitions provided by the emerging literature. Secondly, to suggest an initial research approach with which research on CE can be conducted. Our analysis shows that the existing CE work is mainly done on the practical and technical levels of the <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> <b>flows</b> of materials and energy in production-consumption systems. The focus of the extant literature is on concrete metrics, tools, instruments and computations. Therefore, the basic assumptions concerning the values, societal structures, cultures, underlying world-views and the paradigmatic potential of CE remain largely unexplored. We argue that CE has already become what Gallie (1955) more than six decades ago termed as an “essentially contested concept” (ECC). The paper further suggests a model for CE research that helps in the categorization, classification and organization of research and investigation on CE. The model can help in limiting the observed unbalance and enhance {{the contribution of the}} CE approach to a more sustainable global society. QC 20180117 </p...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a method to}} test if a given velocity definition corresponds to an <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> <b>flow</b> in a dispersive medium. We utilize the equivalence of the pulse dynamics in the real-ω and real-k Fourier expansion approaches as a test tool. To demonstrate our method, we take the definition introduced by Peatross et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 2370 (2000) ] and calculate the velocity in two different ways. We calculate (i) the mean arrival time between two positions in space, using the real-ω Fourier expansion for the fields and (ii) the mean spatial displacement between two points in time, using the Fourier expansion in real-k space. We compare the velocities calculated in the two approaches. If the velocity definition truly corresponds to an actual flow, the two velocities must be the same. However, we show that the two velocities differ significantly (3 %) {{in the region of}} superluminal propagation even for the successful definition of Peatross et al...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new framework, CVSys, for dynamic and fully distributed cardiovascular simulation with natural behavior flow and dynamic simulation control. This coordination framework uniquely incorporates attributes of open-endedness {{in terms of}} dynamic interactive entry of changing states during runtime, flexibility of event handling and system extensibility. The coordination framework relies on the autonomous object paradigm underlying a new distributed computing environment, MESSENGERS 1. CVSys exploits extensive parallelism found in physiological processes. Natural behavior flow is the guiding principle of design and development, closely coupling model and compute processes to <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> entity <b>flow</b> patterns, resulting in a more indigenous and a more integrated system representation. Dynamic simulation control serves to interject new events or state changes into the simulation in a random and dynamic method during runtime without halting execution and under fully d [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Robust land {{footprint}} indicators {{can potentially}} extend the consumption-based resource use {{indicator of the}} German sustainability strategy, which focuses on abiotic resources including fossil fuels, metals, and construction and industrial minerals and decidedly excludes biotic resources. Various approaches exist for quantifying the land embodied in international trade flows and consumption, i. e. the land footprint. These can be classified into a) environmental-economic accounting approaches, applying input-output analysis and tracking supply chains in monetary values, b) physical accounting approaches, using an accounting framework based on data for production, trade and utilization of agricultural and forestry commodities and tracking supply chains in physical units, and c) hybrid accounting, combining elements from both environmental-economic and physical accounting. The results of recent studies vary widely, indicating a lack of robustness and thus hampering their application in policy making. This report provides an in-depth review of {{the current state of}} the art in measuring land footprints. We identify differences in available accounting methods and indicate their shortcomings, which are mainly attributable to the product and supply chain coverage and detail, and biases introduced by the use of monetary flows as a proxy for <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> <b>flows.</b> We offer options and give clear recommendations for the further development of actual and virtual global biomass and land flow ac-counting methods, particularly highlighting the advantages of hybrid accounting approaches as a framework for the robust and transparent assessment of land footprints associated with global bio-mass flows.

30|$|The {{construction}} industry contributes around 18 % {{of greenhouse gas}} emissions, 40 % of depletion of natural resources, and 25 % of wastes globally. To reduce these impacts, construction industries can adopt low-carbon alternatives for construction materials and waste minimisation strategies, including the recycling of construction and demolition waste. However, a comprehensive understanding of the full life cycle carbon profile of low-carbon and recyclable construction materials is required to accurately assess the efficacy of decarbonisation strategies in the built environment. Despite recent progress in hybrid life cycle assessment (hybrid LCA) methods, some weaknesses remain {{with respect to the}} inherent uncertainty relating to price variations and aggregated sectors that are unable to provide detailed waste-specific information in hybrid LCA. Furthermore, attributional, hybrid LCA for a functional unit does not reflect the <b>actual,</b> economy-wide <b>physical</b> <b>flows</b> of materials in a real economy. In this study, a mixed-unit hybrid LCA approach based on a combination of process life cycle inventory, input–output, and material flow data is used to model the economy-wide potential use of recycled construction materials in Australia. A comparison between methods of life cycle emissions of geopolymer concrete revealed that the mixed-unit hybrid LCA approach produced a more accurate and Australian-specific result. The usefulness of the proposed mixed-unit IO model is demonstrated through quantifying the cradle-to-gate embodied emissions of recycled construction materials and by-products utilised in concrete and steel sectors in Australia. The results yield a 1 % reduction when recycled concrete aggregate completely replaces natural aggregate in both ordinary Portland cement and geopolymer concrete. Greenhouse gas emissions reduction of 30 % is quantified for geopolymer concrete using recycled concrete aggregate compared with ordinary Portland cement concrete utilising natural aggregate and 43 % is estimated for electric arc furnace route using iron and steel scrap compared with basic oxygen furnace route. The method merges physical and monetary units of industrial systems related to low-carbon alternatives and recycled construction materials to enable the calculations of embodied carbon with improved accuracy. The results of this study can help inform decarbonisation strategies in the built environment sector.|$|R

40|$|SummaryObjectiveFew {{data are}} {{available}} on the level of <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> activity in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip and knee. The aim {{of this study was to}} measure the level of <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> activity of patients with end-stage OA of the hip and the knee, to compare this with that of matched healthy controls, and to analyze the data in order to ascertain the factors of influence. MethodThe <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> activity was measured with an activity monitor (AM) in 40 hip and 44 knee OA patients, and compared with measurements obtained from healthy controls. Data were also collected on pain and psychological aspects as anxiety, depression and mental functioning. The primary outcome parameter of the <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> activity was the percentage of movement-related activity. ResultsThe percentage of movement-related activity did not differ between the two OA groups. It was 8. 8 (4. 2) % for the hip and 8. 1 (3. 8) % for the knee OA patients. The matched controls were significantly higher movement-related active than OA patients (about 11. 0 (2. 9) %). Increasing age and body mass index were negatively associated with the percentage of movement-related activity (β=− 0. 29 and β=− 0. 25, respectively), whereas mental functioning was positively related (β= 0. 30). ConclusionThe impact of end-stage OA on the level of <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> activity is equal for hip and knee OA patients. The <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> activity for both of the OA groups was significantly and clinically relevantly lower compared to controls. However, this difference was smaller than expected and less dominant than patients' perception of limitations in daily life. Clinicians must be aware that the patients' perception of physical functioning in daily life does not always correspond to the <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> activity...|$|R
