The probability is higher when <b>a</b> <b>trade</b> is of lower dollar volume, lower buy-order imbalance, lower bid-ask spread, when it is <b>a</b> <b>trade</b> of <b>a</b> smaller firm, <b>a</b> <b>trade</b> of <b>a</b> stock with higher trading frequency, higher price level, and the security is approved for short selling.

5|$|In 1685 Siam {{attempted}} to cede Singora to France: the {{hope was that}} the French East India Company, supported by a garrison of troops, could rebuild the city, establish <b>a</b> <b>trading</b> post and counter the strong regional Dutch influence. The city was offered to France's envoy to Siam, the Chevalier de Chaumont, and a provisional treaty signed in December; Siamese ambassador Kosa Pan sailed to France the following year to ratify the cession.

5|$|In 1901, trader Ebenezer Barnette sailed up Alaska's Tanana River {{in hopes}} of {{establishing}} <b>a</b> <b>trading</b> post on the trail connecting the coastal town of Valdez with the gold-mining community of Eagle. Due to low water, however, the steamboat Barnette chartered was unable to continue up the river. Discouraged, Barnette deposited his cache of goods on a riverbank of the Chena River and sailed downstream {{with the intent of}} making another attempt to sail up the river during the following year. In 1902, miner Felix Pedro struck gold at a spot about 15 miles north of the spot where Barnette left his supplies. Seeing an opportunity, Barnette decided to establish <b>a</b> <b>trading</b> post at the spot. Other miners and suppliers arrived, attracted by the gold, and Barnette named the settlement Fairbanks, after Indiana Senator and later Vice President of the United States Charles W. Fairbanks.|$|E

Starting in the late 17th century, French explorers arrived.

It attracted French settlers leaving Illinois when Britain took control east of the Mississippi. The city grew in population due to its location as <b>a</b> <b>trading</b> post on the Mississippi River, as the western fur trade was lucrative. The city played a small role in the American Revolutionary War and became part of the U.S. through the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{restoration}} of the monarchy in 1660, and the removal of the garrison from York in 1688, the city was dominated by the gentry and merchants, although the clergy were still important.
