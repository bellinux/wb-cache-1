5|$|Crash noted how Knight Lore masking {{technique}} addressed issues of flicker and attribute clash, and Sinclair User appreciated how Sabreman disappeared from view when passing behind blocks. In criticism, reviewers considered Knight Lore sound {{to be its}} weakest component, though Your Spectrum and Clash also identified the sometimes cruel difficulty of its gameplay. Later rooms of the castle require pixel-perfect precision, compounded by the <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> the running timer, and the game's animations would slow down proportional {{to the degree of}} onscreen action.|$|E
5|$|The strike {{heightened}} public fear {{of labor}} unrest {{and the possible}} radicalism that lay behind it. It contributed to the public <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> the period known as the Red Scare of 1919–1920. The failure of this and other strikes {{in the years following}} World War I contributed to declining union membership in subsequent years. The American Federation of Labor responded to political pressure experienced during the strike and revoked the charters it had granted to police unions. That ended police unionism in the U.S. for two decades, as police would not try to organize until World War II.|$|E

5|$|Shining Armor, Princess Celestia and {{the others}} {{apologize}} to Twilight for not believing her, and Princess Celestia commends Twilight Sparkle, for it was her instincts and conviction to them that ultimately saved the day; she is heralded as the one, true hero. The wedding ceremony is quickly rescheduled, with Twilight eagerly overseeing preparations for a much happier and profoundly appreciative Cadance. Shining Armor and Princess Cadance are married, and a celebration ensues, with Twilight as the wedding singer ("Love is in Bloom"). During the ceremony and the reception, Twilight's ingering <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> losing touch with her brother is finally put to rest when Shining confesses that he persuaded Cadance to accept his proposal when he mentioned she would gain Twilight as a sister-in-law. Furthermore, just before the couple departs for their honeymoon, Shining thanks his sister for all she has done and the siblings reaffirm their love.|$|E

25|$|Maria Wyke {{has written}} that the play {{reflects}} the general <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> Elizabethan England over succession of leadership. At {{the time of its}} creation and first performance, Queen Elizabeth, a strong ruler, was elderly and had refused to name a successor, leading to worries that a civil war similar to that of Rome might break out after her death.|$|E

25|$|The Scream is Munch's {{most famous}} work, {{and one of}} the most {{recognizable}} paintings in all art. It has been widely interpreted as representing the universal <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> modern man. Painted with broad bands of garish color and highly simplified forms, and employing a high viewpoint, it reduces the agonized figure to a garbed skull in the throes of an emotional crisis.|$|E
25|$|This deep {{alignment}} station required heavy pylons {{to support}} the vaults. In 1930s, architects were obsessed with relieving passengers' <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> being underground, {{so one of the}} objectives was to make these pylons look slimmer. Dushkin proposed an interesting solution - decorate the pylons with wider arches, filling the gap between the fake and real arch with sculpture. This, he presumed, would narrow the perceived width of pylons.|$|E

25|$|With this defeat, the Japanese Burma Area Army {{was reduced}} to an {{ineffective}} fighting force. With the majority of Burma liberated, word that Japan had surrendered on 15 August only increased the <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> the Japanese {{to get to the}} Tenasserim hills. They did not however wish to be immobilised on the eastern bank of the Sittang so another 2,000 more died after the battle had been fought, many in the first days of peace. It was the last big battle on land of World War II involving the Western Allies.|$|E
25|$|Bloom {{has a deep}} {{appreciation}} for Shakespeare and considers {{him to be the}} supreme center of the Western canon. The first edition of The <b>Anxiety</b> <b>of</b> Influence almost completely avoided Shakespeare, whom Bloom considered, at the time, barely touched by the psychological drama of anxiety. The second edition, published in 1997, adds a long preface that mostly expounds on Shakespeare's debt to Ovid and Chaucer, and his agon with his contemporary Christopher Marlowe, who set the stage for him by breaking free of ecclesiastical and moralizing overtones.|$|E
25|$|Existential – Existential {{psychotherapy}} postulates {{that people}} are largely free to choose {{who we are and}} how we interpret and interact with the world. It intends to help the client find deeper meaning in life and to accept responsibility for living. As such, it addresses fundamental issues of life, such as death, aloneness, and freedom. The therapist emphasizes the client’s ability to be self-aware, freely make choices in the present, establish personal identity and social relationships, create meaning, and cope with the natural <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> living.|$|E

25|$|Colette was 67 {{years old}} at the fall of France, and {{remained}} in Paris, in her apartment in the Palais Royal. Her husband Maurice Goudeket, a Jew, was arrested by the Gestapo in December 1941, and although he was released after a few months through the intervention of the French wife of the German ambassador, Colette lived {{through the rest of the}} war years with the <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> a possible second arrest. During the Occupation she produced two volumes of memoirs, Journal à rebours (1941) and De ma fenêtre (1942 — the two issued in English in 1975 as Looking Backwards).|$|E
25|$|As a boy, Bloom read Hart Crane's Collected Poems, a {{collection}} that inspired his lifelong fascination with poetry. Bloom {{went to the}} Bronx High School of Science (where his grades were poor but his standardized-test scores were high), and subsequently received a B.A. from Cornell in 1951, {{where he was a}} student of English literary critic M.H. Abrams, and a PhD from Yale in 1955. Bloom was a standout student at Yale, where he clashed with the faculty of New Critics including William K. Wimsatt. Several years later, Bloom dedicated his first major book, The <b>Anxiety</b> <b>of</b> Influence, to Wimsatt.|$|E
25|$|Following {{their second}} album, The Band {{embarked}} {{on their first}} tour as a lead act. The <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> fame was clear, as the group's songs turned to darker themes of fear and alienation: the influence on their next work is self-explanatory. Stage Fright (1970) was engineered by musician-engineer-producer Todd Rundgren and recorded on a theatre stage in Woodstock, but the fraying of the group's once-fabled unity was beginning to show. As on their previous, self-titled record, Robertson was credited {{with most of the}} songwriting. However, the trademark vocal style of The Band's three lead singers was much less prominent on this work.|$|E

25|$|The <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> {{heterosexual}} individuals (particularly adolescents whose {{construction of}} heterosexual masculinity {{is based in}} part on not being seen as gay) that others may identify them as gay has also been identified by Michael Kimmel as an example of homophobia. The taunting of boys seen as eccentric (and who are not usually gay) is said to be endemic in rural and suburban American schools, and has been associated with risk-taking behavior and outbursts of violence (such as a spate of school shootings) by boys seeking revenge or trying to assert their masculinity. Homophobic bullying is also very common in schools in the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the company}} in the train were four ladies, who are deserving of honourable mention, from the courage they {{displayed}} in accompanying it, namely, Mrs. Nichs. Wood, and Miss F. Wood, Mrs. I. L. Bell, and her sister, Miss Pattinson of Washington. As the train passed steadily over the bridge the <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> the immense multitude seemed intense, and the scene was truly exciting, yet fearful—not only from the lofty eminence occupied by the train, but, from the apparent narrowness and nakedness of the platform on which it rolled along. It seemed from its noiselessness, rather an aerial flight, than the rattling sweep of the iron horse.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the things}} the movie does best is {{transport}} you back in time and into nature. In the early scenes as Joel leaves his aunt's home to travel across the South by rickety bus and horse and carriage, you feel the strangeness, wonder and <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> a child abandoning everything that's familiar to go to a place so remote he has to ask directions along the way. The landscape over which he travels is so rich and fertile that you can almost smell the earth and sky. Later on, when Joel tussles with Idabell (Aubrey Dollar), a tomboyish neighbor who becomes his best friend (a character inspired by the author Harper Lee), the movie has a special force and clarity in its evocation of the physical immediacy of being a child playing outdoors.|$|E
