25|$|Although {{approximately}} half of Acts deals with Paul's life and works, the Book of Acts does not refer to Paul writing letters. Historians believe that the author of Acts did {{not have access to}} any of Paul's letters. One piece of evidence suggesting this is that Acts never directly quotes from the Pauline epistles.

Therefore, it is sufficient to bounds check only the <b>accesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> data structures that can possibly hold the external inputs. Also, it is sufficient to bounds check only the memory writes. The proposed optimizations reduce the number of required bounds checks as well as the amount of meta-data that need to be maintained <b>to</b> perform <b>those</b> checks. ...|$|R

It uses a legal empowerment framework composed of three levels: normative, institutional and individual. The paper bases the analysis on the existing regulations, and an empirical study conducted with those working for the public institution, and with victims of domestic violence that <b>accessed</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> institutions seeking for assistance. The paper gives a comprehensive approach and provides reflections on what aspects of the laws and institutions are actually being of benefit for victims of domestic violence...|$|R

25|$|The {{buildings}} {{at the western}} end of the complex, including the control tower, were returned to civilian use. Externally they were rendered and painted in art-deco style, to give a modern appearance. Internally a passenger terminal was fitted out, including a glass-walled observation restaurant facing the apron. As a public relations exercise, space was allocated within the lower tower as a club room for the Ringway Spotters Club. This branch of the Ian Allen-inspired hobby of aircraft spotting later changed its name to Society of Northern Aeronautical Enthusiasts, rapidly becoming known by its initials, SNAE. Members sported an enamel badge similar to the BOAC Bluebird but in red in place of blue. These spotters and the general public were catered for by a large viewing enclosure, adjacent to {{the western end of}} the building. They were provided with a more modest cafe, {{in the form of a}} large single-storey prefabricated building. Near this cafe, a small gate in the chain link fence, which kept the public off the apron, gave <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> wanting to take a pleasure flight.
