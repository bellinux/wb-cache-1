40|$|Despite the {{pervasive}} use of <b>anti-virus</b> (AV) <b>software,</b> {{there has not}} been a systematic study of the characteristics of the execution of this workload. In this paper we present a characterization of four commonly used <b>anti-virus</b> <b>software</b> <b>packages.</b> Using the Virtutech Simics toolset, we profile the behavior of four popular anti-virus packages as run on an Intel PentiumIV platform running Microsoft Windows-XP. In our study, we focus on the overhead introduced by the <b>anti-virus</b> <b>software</b> during onaccess execution. The overhead associated with anti-virus execution can dominate overall performance. The AV-Test group has already reported that this overhead can range from 23 - 129 % on live systems running on-access experiments [3]. 1 The performance impact of the anti-virus execution is clearly an important issue, and we present the first quantitative study of the characteristics of this workload. Our study includes the impact of both operating system execution and system call execution. ...|$|R

From this research, Microsoft {{made the decision to}} include a visible control panel with Windows XP Service Pack 2 that would provide a consolidated view of the most important security features. Service Pack 2, released in August 2004, includes the first version of Windows Security Center (WSC). This version monitors Windows Update, Windows Firewall, and the availability of an anti-virus program. Third-party providers of personal firewall and <b>anti-virus</b> <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> were encouraged to use WSC API to register their products with WSC.|$|R

In general, current users are satisfied with their <b>anti-virus</b> <b>software.</b> Adequate financial resources and lack of management commitment were expressed as the primary limitations to implementing more pervasive security procedure measures within organizations. Most organizations wait until they suffer a substantial attack before they implement serious anti-virus policies and install virus-scanning software.

40|$|JavaScript based {{attacks have}} been {{reported}} as the top Internet security threats in recent years. Since most of the Internet users rely on <b>anti-virus</b> <b>software</b> {{to protect themselves from}} malicious JavaScript code, attackers exploit JavaScript obfuscation techniques to evade the detection of <b>anti-virus</b> <b>software.</b> To better understand the obfuscation techniques adopted by malicious JavaScript code, we conduct a measurement study. We first categorize observed JavaScript obfuscation techniques. Then we conduct a statistic analysis on the usage of different categories of obfuscation techniques in real-world malicious JavaScript samples. We also study the detection effectiveness of 20 most popular <b>anti-virus</b> <b>software</b> against obfuscation techniques. Based on the results, we analyze the cause of the popularity of obfuscation in malicious JavaScript code; the reason behind the choice of obfuscation techniques and the difference between benign obfuscation and malicious obfuscation. Moreover, we also provide suggestions for designing effective obfuscation detection approaches in future. 1...|$|R
40|$|Although <b>anti-virus</b> <b>software</b> has {{significantly}} {{evolved over the}} last decade, classic signature matching based on byte patterns is still a prevalent concept for identifying security threats. Anti-virus signatures are a simple and fast detection mechanism that can complement more sophisticated analysis strategies. However, if signatures are not designed with care, they can turn from a defensive mechanism into an instrument of attack. In this paper, we present a novel method for automatically deriving signatures from <b>anti-virus</b> <b>software</b> and demonstrate how the extracted signatures {{can be used to}} attack sensible data with the aid of the virus scanner itself. We study the practicability of our approach using four commercial products and exemplarily discuss a novel attack vector made possible by insufficiently designed signatures. Our research indicates that there is an urgent need to improve pattern-based signatures if used in <b>anti-virus</b> <b>software</b> and to pursue alternative detection approaches in such products...|$|R
