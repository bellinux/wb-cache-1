40|$|The {{effects of}} {{changing}} the operating pressure and temperature on the solvating strength of supercritical carbon dioxide and the solubility of crude palm oil in the solvent were discussed. The operating temperatures and pressures investigated are 40, 50 and 60 °C, and 110, 140 and 200 bars. Changes in pressure showed a stronger influence on palm oil solubility in CO 2 compared to temperature. The rate of extraction and the solubility of palm oil increased when the system pressure was increased (at constant temperature) or when the system temperature was decreased (at constant pressure). These results are comparable with the reported results of solubility of other vegetable oils such as soybean and olive oils. The change in the physical behaviour and the colour of the <b>oil</b> <b>extracts</b> and <b>residues</b> were also observed. It was discovered that the initial fractions of palm <b>oil</b> <b>extracted</b> were solid like while the latter fractions were semi-liquid. As the extraction progressed, the orange colour of the fractions became progressively more intense at 200 bars.

40|$|The {{ability of}} the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium to degrade {{polycyclic}} aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that are present in <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> (a distillation product obtained from coal tar) was demonstrated. Analysis by capillary gas chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography showed that at least 22 PAHs, including all of the most abundant PAH components present in <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil,</b> underwent 70 to 100 % disappearance during 27 days of incubation with nutrient nitrogen-limited cultures of this fungus. Because phenanthrene is the most abundant PAH present in <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil,</b> this PAH was selected for further study.

This has led to investiga-tions of alternative uses for coffee in addi-tion to its consumption as a beverage. Encouraging pilot studies {{have been based on}} the possible use of solvent ex-tracted coffee oil in food products. Analyti-cal data on coffee oil have revealed its com-position to be similar to other edible vege-table oils (Sivetz, 1963).

40|$|When certain {{oils and}} {{polymers}} are heated under an inert atmosphere, a high viscosity liquid forms. Examples include crude oil, coal tar, and PVC. Upon further heating, this liquid becomes a progressively harder solid called pitch. Pitch that contains crystalline areas is called mesophase pitch. Mesophase pitch {{is required for}} the production of graphite. The purpose of the research was to investigate whether <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> can be used for the production of mesophase pitch for sintering purposes. Sintering involves heating a powder under pressure to produce a solid. <b>Anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> is a low-value by-product of coke production from coal. Despite its low market value, it has unique properties. It consists primarily of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and it is free of primary quinoline insoluble material. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are the precursors for mesophase pitch formation, while quinoline insoluble material hinders mesophase growth. These attributes make it a good potential starting material for the production of mesophase pitch, which may be used for sintering and carbon fibre production. In the search for a mesophase pitch that can be sintered, a variety of pitches were produced from <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil.</b> This was done by varying the heat treatment time and temperature. The pitches produced were characterised to determine their glass transition temperature, melting temperature, carbon yield and optical microstructure. This was done to determine their sintering potential. A high mesophase content, high softening temperature and high carbonisation yield were considered essential for effective sintering. Pitches with a high mesophase content were produced. Longer heat treatment led to higher carbon yields, higher glass transition temperatures, higher softening temperatures and higher mesophase content.

40|$|The main {{feedstocks}} for {{the production}} of oil-furnace carbon black are different kinds of liquid hydrocarbons. The quality and utilization of oil-furnace carbon black mainly depends on the type of liquid hydrocarbons contained in the oil feedstocks. In practice, both carbochemical and petrochemical oils are used as feedstock sources. Carbochemical oils are fractions obtained during coal tar distillation. <b>Anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> is one of these oils. Depending on the conditions of distillation, coal tars contain up to w = 18 · 10 – 2 highly aromatic fractions, which can be used as carbon black feedstock. The sulphur fraction of these oils can vary between w = 0. 5 and 0. 7 · 10 – 2, depending on the origin of the coal. The availability of carbochemical oils obtained from coal tar is largely dependent on the production of coke used in the manufacture of steel. The quantities available today are insufficient to satisfy the demand for carbon black feedstock. In addition, in highly industrialized countries, production of carbochemicaloils is declining. Although, carbochemical oils are preferred in terms of efficiency, petrochemical oils are more important in terms of quantities available, particularly in the production of furnace blacks. These are residual oils resulting either from catalytic cracking processes or from the production of olefins in steam crackers using naphtha or gas oil as raw material. Nevertheless, the choice of carbon black feedstock is not determined merely by price and efficiency, but also by specific quality criteria. However, due to their origin, the feedstocks are mixtures {{of a large number of}} individual substances and are, therefore, not easy to characterize. More than 200 different components have been recorded in the range detectable by gas chromatography. Some important components of carbon black feedstock are listed in table 1. 1 An important parameter for the evaluation of carbon black feedstock is density, since it increases with increasing aromaticity. It is also used for determination of the Bureau of Mines Correlation Index (BMCI), 2 which is obtained either from density and midboiling point, or from density andviscosity for those feedstocks which cannot be distilled completely. This index is used by the carbon black industry as an important criteria for feedstock evaluation. The sulphur fraction in feedstocks should not exceed w = 2. 5 · 10 – 2, because a higher content greatly affects the quality of carbon black, pollutes the atmosphere, and accelerates corrosion of the facility. The maximum sulphur content in the typical hydrocarbon feedstock is w = 1. 2 · 10 – 2. 3. A very important factor of hydrocarbon feedstock is the fraction of alkaline earth metals, especially sodium and potassium. The maximum sodium fraction may be w = 20 · 10 – 6, while the maximum potassium fraction is w = 2 · 10 – 6. The maximum fraction of asphalthenes is w = 15 · 10 – 2. Asphalthenes, determined as pentane-insoluble matter, provide indications concerning the possibility of grit formation. Another very important factor is the temperature range of distillation, which should be low enough, because the hydrocarbon feedstock must evaporize before entering the hot region of the reactor. The viscosity, the pour point, and for safety reasons, the flash point determines the handling properties and storage conditions of the feedstock. In addition, the water fraction in the hydrocarbon feedstock is one of the most important factors. The water fraction in hydrocarbon feedstock influences the handling properties of the same. The maximum water fraction in hydrocarbon feedstock may be w = 2. 0 · 10 – 2, and desirably below w = 1. 0 · 10 – 2. A higher water fraction represent a considerable impact on the financial construction. Also, it is very difficult to manipulate such feedstock, especially unloading, and in the production of oil-furnace carbon black. Namely, every water fraction higher than w = 2. 0 · 10 – 2 in the hydrocarbon feedstock, causes the phenomenon of cavitations. In the oil-furnace carbon black plant of Petrokemija d. d. Kutina, the storage tank TK 48003, was filled with 800 tons of <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil.</b> The average water fraction in the tank was w = 10 · 10 – 2. It was impossible to manipulate in the process of production, because the mentioned water fraction caused the cavitations effect. Therefore, it was necessary to decrease the water fraction to below w = 2. 0 · 10 – 2, which will be satisfactory for production. As the water and <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> formed a homogeneous emulsion (similar density at all temperatures), it was impossible to manage decanting the water from the <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil.</b> Additionally, it was impossible to manage evaporation of the water from the oil by heating the whole emulsion,because the flash point of <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> is in the temperature range of T = 100 to 105 °C. Distillation of the whole emulsion of 800 tons was also impossible, because there was no distillation column adequate for separating the water from the <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil.</b> Thus, the use of different demulsifiers proved as a potential solution for separating the homogeneous mixture of <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> and water. Namely, demulsifiers are a special type of high molecular tensides and organic solvents, which serve for separation the water from different hydrocarbons. The most common use is in emulsions with “lighter” hydrocarbons, especially when the density is not above r= 0. 850 g cm – 3. Since the density of <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> ranges from r= 1. 05 to 1. 09 g cm – 3, it was necessary to customise the conditions of application, and to choose the mostadequate demulsifier for the separation of water from <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil.</b> Therefore, we experimented with different kinds of demulsifiers in cooperation with the companies TEH PROJEKT KEMO d. o. o. and KEM PROJEKT d. o. o.

Namely, demulsifiers are a special type of high molecular tensides and organic solvents, which serve for separation the water from different hydrocarbons. The most common use is in emulsions with “lighter” hydrocarbons, especially when the density is not above r= 0. 850 g cm– 3. Since the density of <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> ranges from r= 1. 05 to 1. 09 g cm– 3, it was necessary to customise the conditions of application, and to choose the most adequate demulsifier for the separation of water from <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil.</b> Therefore, we experimented with different kinds of demulsifiers in cooperation with the companies TEH PROJEKT KEMO d. o. o. and KEM PROJEKT d. o. o. In laboratory conditions, we tested five different demulsifiers with different concentrations, and their efficiency in separating the water from <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil.</b> We then chose the most adequate demulsifier, which was applied on an industrial level...|$|R
