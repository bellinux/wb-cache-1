5|$|An absorption-re-emission atomic {{line filter}} <b>absorbs</b> <b>the</b> desired {{wavelength}} {{of light and}} emits light that bypasses broadband filters. In passive absorption-re-emission ALFs, a high-pass filter blocks all low-energy incoming light. The vapor cell <b>absorbs</b> <b>the</b> signal, which coincides with the vapor's thin absorption line, and the cell's atoms become excited. The vapor cell then re-emits the signal light by undergoing fluorescence at a lower frequency. A low-pass filter blocks radiation above {{the frequency of the}} fluorescent light. In an active ALF, optical or electrical pumping is used for exciting these atoms so they absorb or emit light of different wavelengths. For active ALFs, other systems of conventional filters may be needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{stomach lining}} rapidly <b>absorbs</b> <b>the</b> blood plasma, which is quickly {{transported to the}} kidneys, {{and on to the}} bladder for excretion. A common vampire bat begins to expel urine within two minutes of feeding.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of buffers and chain couplers, the draw gear behind the hooks, if any, will <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> tension, while the side buffers will <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> compression.|$|R

2500|$|Southwestern Bell {{continued}} to grow in size when it absorbed several smaller telephone companies. In 1950, <b>the</b> company <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> operations of Southeast Missouri Telephone Company, which had been formerly named Cape Girardeau Bell Telephone Company. In 1952, <b>the</b> company <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> operations of the Southwest Telephone Company, which served Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma. In 1953, it <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> Ozark Central Telephone Company ...|$|R
5|$|According to a latter {{episode of}} the Devi Mahatmya that deals with {{the killing of the}} demon Raktabija, the warrior-goddess Durga creates the Matrikas from herself and with their help slaughters the demon army. When the demon Shumbha {{challenges}} Durga to single combat, she <b>absorbs</b> <b>the</b> Matrikas into herself. In the Vamana Purana, the Matrikas arise from different parts of the Divine Mother Chandika; Varahi arises from Chandika's back.|$|E
5|$|Because {{most of the}} {{pipeline}} was built above permafrost, each of the pipes holding up the raised sections of pipeline contained a sealed tube of ammonia. As the permafrost below {{the pipeline}} warms, the ammonia <b>absorbs</b> <b>the</b> heat and rises to a radiator {{on top of each}} stanchion. The ammonia is cooled by the outside air, condenses, and falls back {{to the bottom of the}} tube, where the process repeats.|$|E
5|$|Some {{signal lights}} use a {{luminous}} paint, containing a phosphor that <b>absorbs</b> <b>the</b> beta radiation emitted by promethium-147 and emits light. This isotope {{does not cause}} aging of the phosphor, as alpha emitters do, and therefore the light emission is stable for a few years. Originally, radium-226 {{was used for the}} purpose, but it was later replaced by promethium-147 and tritium (hydrogen-3). Promethium may be favored over tritium for nuclear safety reasons.|$|E
50|$|On June 6, 2005, Miyako <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> town of Tarō, {{and village}} of Niisato, more than {{doubling}} the old city's size. On January 1, 2010, Miyaki <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> village of Kawai (also from Shimohei District).|$|R
50|$|Remarkably, {{although}} <b>the</b> NFL <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> AAFC, the AAFC {{actually had}} better average attendance.|$|R
5000|$|In 1879, <b>the</b> LNWR also <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> Bedford Railway {{which had}} {{constructed}} {{a line between}} Bletchley and [...] It had already <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> Bedford and Sandy Railway in 1865, which had constructed a line between Bedford and [...]|$|R
5|$|The first Mew Mew Ichigo {{encounters}} is Minto Aizawa, a spoiled, wealthy {{girl and}} ballerina who is infused with {{the genes of}} the blue lorikeet; Retasu Midorikawa, a shy but smart girl who endures constant bullying from three girls and <b>absorbs</b> <b>the</b> genes of the finless porpoise; a hyper and yet young girl named Bu-Ling Huang who receives the genes of the golden lion tamarin; and Zakuro Fujiwara, a professional actress and model infused with the genes of the gray wolf.|$|E
5|$|According to latter {{episode of}} Devi Mahatmya, Durga created Matrikas from herself {{and with their}} help {{slaughtered}} the demon army. In this version, Kali {{is described as a}} Matrika, who sucked all the blood of demon Raktabija. Kali is given the epithet Chamunda in the text. When demon Shumbha challenges Durga to a single combat, she <b>absorbs</b> <b>the</b> Matrikas in herself and says that they are her different forms. In the Vamana Purana too, the Matrikas arise from different parts of Devi and not from male gods although they are described and named after the male deities.|$|E
5|$|After Ultimecia is defeated, {{the time}} and space that she had absorbed begin to return to normal, pulling Squall's comrades back into their places in the timeline, while Squall returns to the orphanage and meets a younger Edea. Since {{she does not want}} to involve the children, she <b>absorbs</b> <b>the</b> dying Ultimecia's powers as part of the cycle of sorceresses (a sorceress must pass her powers to a {{successor}} before she can die peacefully). Squall plants the ideas for Garden and SeeD in her mind, creating an origin paradox: Squall must become leader of Balamb Garden so he can pass its version of SeeD tradition to Edea, who teaches them to her husband Cid (who co-founds Balamb Garden, which admits Edea's orphans—including Squall).|$|E
50|$|In 1974, Thermal Belt Telephone <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> {{operations}} of Eastern Rowan Telephone, Mid-Carolina Telephone, and Mooresville Telephone. Following the merger, Thermal Belt Telephone became Mid-Carolina Telephone Company. It also <b>absorbed</b> <b>The</b> Old Town Telephone System and North Carolina Telephone in 1977.|$|R
50|$|In 1934, <b>the</b> Gazette <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> South Side Sentinel of Marion, Nebraska. In 1936, it {{acquired}} the triweekly McCook Tribune, at which Strunk {{had worked on}} his arrival in McCook. Later, in 1957, it <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> Red Willow County Reporter.|$|R
5000|$|On 25 January 2014 NEOS <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> Liberal Forum, {{creating}} [...] "NEOS - The New Austria and Liberal Forum". In March 2014, it also <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> independent Young Liberals (JuLis), {{forming the}} party's youth wing JUNOS - Young liberal NEOS.|$|R
5|$|Green {{is common}} in nature, as many plants are green because of a complex {{chemical}} known as chlorophyll, which is involved in photosynthesis. Chlorophyll <b>absorbs</b> <b>the</b> long wavelengths of light (red) and short wavelengths of light (blue) much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye, so light reflected by plants is enriched in green. Chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple halobacteria were already exploiting photosynthesis. Their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the green portion of the spectrum using bacteriorhodopsin. The new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction of light were selected to exploit those portions of the spectrum not used by the halobacteria.|$|E
5|$|The Eye's {{aggression}} {{may even}} extend to deities who, unlike Apep, are not regarded as evil. Evidence in early funerary texts suggests that at dawn, Ra {{was believed to}} swallow the multitude of other gods, who in this instance are equated with the stars, which vanish at sunrise and reappear at sunset. In doing so, he <b>absorbs</b> <b>the</b> gods' power, thereby renewing his own vitality, before spitting them out again at nightfall. The solar Eye is said to assist in this effort, slaughtering the gods for Ra to eat. The red light of dawn therefore signifies the blood produced by this slaughter.|$|E
5|$|Timmy {{wakes up}} in what looks like his bedroom; in reality he is still inside The Darkness, {{and the world is}} merely an {{illusion}} to him. Timmy's fairy godparents and Jorgen come to rescue him, and they exit The Darkness successfully. Back on Earth, the Lead Eliminator uses Jorgen's wand to poof Timmy's friends and family away into The Darkness. Military Extraterrestrial Research Facility (M.E.R.F.) agents launch an array of military weapons at the Eliminator, but he <b>absorbs</b> <b>the</b> ordnance and turns into a more powerful version, the Destructinator. He surrounds the Earth with a steel casing, which transforms the M.E.R.F. agents into his henchmen. They plant explosives inside Earth and give the Destructinator a detonation remote.|$|E
500|$|In 1934, <b>the</b> Gazette <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> South Side Sentinel of Marion, Nebraska.

50|$|In the Summer of 2010, <b>the</b> Cobourg Cougars <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> Bowmanville Eagles. This move {{eliminated}} {{their local}} competition for players and local fan base. In March 2011, <b>the</b> Cougars also <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> Streetsville Derbys. The Cougars {{were chosen to}} host the 2017 Royal Bank Cup.|$|R
50|$|Height is {{gained by}} placing a boulder on any visible square, and putting a Synthoid on the boulder. The player may then {{transfer}} consciousness to the new Synthoid, and <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> old one. Stacks of boulders of any height may be created, if the player has enough energy. In order to <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> Sentinel, the player must create a stack of boulders of sufficient height that the Synthoid on top can {{look down on the}} Sentinel's platform. When the Sentinel has been <b>absorbed,</b> <b>the</b> player may no longer absorb any energy from the landscape, although objects may be created as normal.|$|R
5|$|Exploration of {{the docks}} reveals a strange {{canister}} filled with swirling liquid. Thinking the canister contains healing or energizing properties, the Shaper breaks the seal and <b>absorbs</b> <b>the</b> contents. Instead the contents absorb into the Shaper's body, strengthening and changing it. The changes become visibly apparent, the player character's skin smoothens and glows slightly. The canisters also affect the user's mental state, causing a more violent and arrogant temperament. Serviles {{remain on the}} island, having been abandoned when the island was Barred. They are intelligent creations of Shapers, designed to serve them without question or hesitation. These Serviles have had no contact with Shapers for two centuries, and have separated into three groups with differing philosophies regarding their creators. The Obeyers are still faithful to the Shapers, the Awakened believe {{that they should be}} treated as equals. The Takers have rejected Shapers completely and view the sect as oppressors to be fought.|$|E
5|$|In the {{developed}} world, {{the majority of}} the poultry reared for meat is raised indoors in big sheds, with automated equipment under environmentally controlled conditions. Chickens raised in this way are known as broilers, and genetic improvements have meant that they can be grown to slaughter weight within six or seven weeks of hatching. Newly hatched chicks are restricted to a small area and given supplementary heating. Litter on the floor <b>absorbs</b> <b>the</b> droppings and the area occupied is expanded as they grow. Feed and water is supplied automatically and the lighting is controlled. The birds may be harvested on several occasions or the whole shed may be cleared at one time. A similar rearing system is usually used for turkeys, which are less hardy than chickens, but they take longer to grow and are often moved on to separate fattening units to finish. Ducks are particularly popular in Asia and Australia and can be killed at seven weeks under commercial conditions.|$|E
5|$|The Elsa {{is pulled}} out of {{hyperspace}} and swallowed by a giant Gnosis. During their attempts to escape Cherenkov transforms into a Gnosis. The group are forced to kill the transformed Cherenkov before escaping on the Elsa and being rescued by Jr.. During the subsequent battle, KOS-MOS activates previously-unseen weaponry and <b>absorbs</b> <b>the</b> attacking Gnosis. While traveling with Jr., the group learn that the Kukai Foundation are gathering and storing the Zohar Emulators created by Mizrahi. Meanwhile, U-TIC uses agents within the Federation to doctor footage of Jr.'s battle with U-TIC and implicate the group {{in the destruction of}} the Woglinde. The group travel to the Kukai Foundation base above Second Miltia, operated by Jr.'s brother Gaignun. They are subsequently held hostage by Federation troops due to U-TIC's influence. With help from an ally of Gaignun, the group retrieve evidence from within KOS-MOS's memory center which can exonerate them.|$|E
50|$|The Edinburgh and Glasgow was <b>absorbed</b> by <b>the</b> North British Railway on 1 August 1865; the E&GR had itself <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> Monkland Railways the {{previous}} day.|$|R
50|$|On May 15, 1877, <b>the</b> PW&B {{formally}} <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> New Castle and Frenchtown and New Castle and Wilmington railroads, {{forming a}} branch line from Wilmington to Rodney. On May 21, 1877, it then <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> Southwark railroad, extending its main {{line to the}} Delaware River waterfront.|$|R
30|$|In {{the first}} {{trimester}} of pregnancy, <b>the</b> <b>absorbed</b> dose to <b>the</b> uterus {{may be used as}} a substitute for <b>the</b> <b>absorbed</b> dose to <b>the</b> embryo. Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>absorbed</b> dose to <b>the</b> fetus from radioactive substances without placental transfer is expected to be within the same range as the dose to the uterus. In the case of radioactive substances with placental transfer, <b>the</b> <b>absorbed</b> dose to organs and tissues of the mother may, as a first approximation, be taken as representative of <b>the</b> <b>absorbed</b> dose to <b>the</b> corresponding organs and tissues of the fetus [51].|$|R
5|$|The {{amount of}} {{americium}} {{in a typical}} new smoke detector is 1microcurie (37kBq) or 0.29 microgram. This amount declines slowly as the americium decays into neptunium-237, a different transuranic element with a much longer half-life (about 2.14 million years). With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a smoke detector includes about 3% neptunium after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. The radiation passes through an ionization chamber, an air-filled space between two electrodes, and permits a small, constant current between the electrodes. Any smoke that enters the chamber <b>absorbs</b> <b>the</b> alpha particles, which reduces the ionization and affects this current, triggering the alarm. Compared to the alternative optical smoke detector, the ionization smoke detector is cheaper and can detect particles which {{are too small to}} produce significant light scattering; however, it is more prone to false alarms.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} {{must then}} defeat the God Beasts {{before they can}} gather and destroy the world. However, after doing this they realize killing the God Beasts has given more power to their main enemy, who their personal enemies were working for—the Dragon Emperor for Duran and Angela, the Dark Prince for Hawk and Lise, and the Masked Mage for Kevin and Carlie. The already powerful villain <b>absorbs</b> <b>the</b> power of the Sword of Mana and the God Beasts {{in order to become}} a god, but is halted by the Mana Goddess blocking some of its power. After defeating the villain's minions, the characters go and defeat their main enemy, but are unable to stop him from destroying the Mana Tree and eliminating all Mana from the world. The Faerie then fuses with what is left of the Mana Tree; she will be reborn as the Mana Goddess in a thousand years, but until then Mana will not exist in the world. As the game ends, the characters go back to their homelands.|$|E
5|$|The player {{character}} is a prisoner being led to an Imperial execution in Helgen. Alduin unexpectedly interrupts the procession, destroying the town before the player can be executed. The player escapes in the chaos and journeys {{to the city of}} Whiterun to request aid against the dragon threat. After slaying a different dragon that attacks nearby, the player <b>absorbs</b> <b>the</b> dragon's soul which grants them the ability to perform a shout. The city's guards inform the player that they must be Dragonborn. The player is summoned to meet with the Greybeards, an order of monks who live in seclusion. The Greybeards train the player in using shouts and inform the player of their role in stopping Alduin. The player learns that Skyrim's civil war is the last in a sequence of prophetic events foretold by the Elder Scrolls, which also predicted the return of Alduin.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the defeat}} of Italian colonial {{authority}} in 1941, Amhara Sayint, Lasta, Raya, Wag and Yejju were annexed to Wollo. Peasant rebellions rocked the province, which included the Woyane rebellion in 1943, and revolts of the Yejju in 1948 and 1970. With {{the adoption of the}} new constitution in 1995, Wollo was divided between the Afar Region, which <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> part of the province that extended into the Afar Depression; the Tigray Region, which <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> northwestern corner; and the Amhara Region, which <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the province in the Ethiopian Highlands.|$|R
