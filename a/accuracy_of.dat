5|$|A {{challenge}} for future successful GWA {{study is to}} apply the findings {{in a way that}} accelerates drug and diagnostics development, including better integration of genetic studies into the drug-development process and a focus on the role of genetic variation in maintaining health as a blueprint for designing new drugs and diagnostics. Several studies have looked into the use of risk-SNP markers as a means of directly improving the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> prognosis. Some have found that the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> prognosis improves, while others report only minor benefits from this use. Generally, a problem with this direct approach is the small magnitudes of the effects observed. A small effect ultimately translates into a poor separation of cases and controls and thus only a small improvement of prognosis accuracy. An alternative application is therefore the potential for GWA studies to elucidate pathophysiology.|$|E

30|$|In general, {{conventional}} codecs, such as h. 26 x and MPEG-x, set GOP {{size from}} 8 to 30, as {{the increasing number}} of intra-frame degrades compression rate. However, a lot of the conventional DVC systems set the GOP size to the minimum of two, because performance of DVC is directly related to <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> SI frames. <b>Accuracies</b> <b>of</b> SI frames cannot be known at both the encoder and decoder sides, and <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> SI frames are generally the best with GOP size set as two. In addition, since <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> SI frames vary, depending on the features of a sequence, they cannot be correctly predicted. However, SI frames are generated well for slow-moving cases. For these cases, GOP size can be prolonged, to reduce the entropy bits and/or parity bits. Therefore, some conventional DVC algorithms are proposed to predict <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> SI frames on the encoder side and increase GOP size [13, 14]. Since the purpose of DVC is to reduce computational complexity of the encoder, they should generate a predicted SI (PSI) with low delay, though an SI frame which is generated using several motion estimation algorithms and filters, for high quality of an SI on the decoder side. Therefore, although the encoder generates a PSI frame by using the estimated MVs and key frames in its own, the PSI frame {{is not the same as}} the SI frame on the decoder side. As a result, the estimated <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> PSI frames are different from those of SI frames and lead to a decrease in compression performance.|$|R

5|$|When skirmishing, light {{infantry}} {{fought in}} pairs, {{so that one}} soldier could cover the other while loading. Line regiments fired in volleys, but skirmishers fired at will, taking careful aim at targets. While some consideration was given to equipping light infantry with rifles, due to their improved accuracy, the expected difficulty and expense in obtaining sufficient rifled weapons resulted in the standard infantry musket being issued to most troops. The <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> the musket decreased at long range and, since the French chasseurs and voltigeurs also used muskets, {{it is likely that}} skirmishers' firefights took place at ranges of only 50 yards (or less). 10 yards provided the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> point-blank range. Although the French infantry (and, earlier, the Americans) frequently used multi-shot and grapeshot in their muskets, the British light infantry used only standard ball ammunition.|$|E

40|$|Astrometry {{is on the}} {{threshold}} of great changes {{due to the fact that}} this decade, alone, is witnessing an improvement of stellar positions equivalent to the total improvement of the previous two centuries. The Hipparcos Satellite has concluded its observations, and the catalog is in preparation. Preliminary results assure that the Hipparcos catalog will provide positions, parallaxes and annual proper motions for over 100, 000 stars with <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> 1. 5 milliarcseconds. In addition, the Tycho catalog will provide positions of about 30 milliarcseconds accuracy for over 1 million stars, and annual proper motions with 3 milliarcsecond accuracy will subsequently be ob­ tained by means of first epoch positions from the Astrographic Catalog. Optical interferometers on the ground are beginning operation, and these instruments can provide observational <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> approximately one milliarcsecond. Also, the traditional reference frame based on the Fun­ damental Catalog of bright stars is being replaced by the extragalactic ref­ erence frame, based on radio sources with <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> one milliarcsecond. Thus, astrometry will change from a fundamental reference frame defined in terms of the dynamical reference frame of the solar system with <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> 100 milliarcseconds to a space-fixed, extragalactic reference frame with <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> one milliarcsecond. Future astrometric observations should be in the 1 - 100 milliarcsecond accuracy range. There are a number of concepts for future astrometric instruments in space. Most of these can provide sub-milliarcsecond astrometric accuracies...|$|R
