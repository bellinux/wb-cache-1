Just a year <b>ago</b> <b>this</b> coming <b>week</b> I arrived here in England and I have enjoyed my stay very much, however, naturally I prefer being back in the states. In your letter you mentioned several boys who were giving there best for their country- {{one of whom was}} my buddy through Bryant- Joe Buerdsell – I have contacted his mother {{as well as a number}} of his intimate friends. For sometime I had hopes that he may have been picked up but now, I guess, he must be presumed lost. My work is quite interesting and have been extremely fortunate in being placed here when I look over some of the other fields where I could have been landed. Paper seems to be running short so must close – hoping to hear from you again. As ever Bill [Transcription ends...|$|R

NPR’s Louisa Lim on the latest theories of Guangxu’s death: “Guangxu died just 22 hours before the 74 -year-old Empress Dowager Cixi. Imperial medical records indicated that Guangxu’s death was due to natural causes. But even then, there were rumors of murder most foul. Now modern science has uncovered the truth. “‘We took a hair measuring 10 inches, and after analysis, we found its arsenic content was 2, 400 times higher than normal,’ says Zhu Chenru, deputy director of the National Committee for the Compilation of Qing history.

40|$|As {{the world}} talks about climate change, the Antarctic Treaty shows how {{politics}} and science can work together, writes Tom Griffiths in Inside Story FIFTY YEARS <b>AGO</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> a remarkable agreement, the Antarctic Treaty, {{was signed in}} Washington. It was created not only by strategic national politics but also by genuine idealism and –­ of special relevance to Australian politicians {{coming to terms with}} climate change –­ by a bipartisan respect for the integrity of good, international science. As we count down to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, it is worth reflecting on the negotiations that led to this enduring political document. Forged in the Cold War era, the treaty {{has proven to be a}} resilient and evolving instrument for international cooperation. Its main object is to promote the peaceful use of Antarctica and to facilitate scientific research south of 60 º latitude. The key provision of the treaty (Article IV) neither recognises nor denies any existing territorial claims to Antarctica. In polar parlance, such claims are “frozen. ” This political compromise emerged from a period of escalating national rivalry over Antarctic sovereignty [...] .

Earlier research on the discretionary countercyclical Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 — enacted three years ago this week—indicates that it too did little to stimulate the economy. 2 Research on the discretionary countercyclical actions in the late 1960 s and 1970 s—the most recent period of such large interventions prior to this past decade—also shows disappointing results, including high unemployment, high inflation, high interest rates, and frequent recessions; the poor results of the 1970 s policies led top macroeconomists to write influential papers, such as “After Keynesian Macroeconomics, ” which questioned the whole approach and to decry “that countercyclical discretionary fiscal policy is neither desirable nor politically feasible. ” 3 My purpose here today is not to explain this recent revival of a failed approach to policy...|$|E
