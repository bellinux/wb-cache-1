40|$|Argonaute (Ago) protein, {{the central}} {{component}} of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, plays important roles in host innate antiviral immunity. Most organisms harbor {{a large number of}} different Ago proteins and isoforms; however, the roles of Ago isoforms in immune defense against pathogens remain unclear. In the present study, three Argonaute- 1 (Ago 1) isoforms, termed <b>Ago</b> 1 <b>A,</b> <b>Ago</b> 1 B, and Ago 1 C, were found in Marsupenaeus japonicus shrimp. Quantitative real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) revealed that isoforms <b>Ago</b> 1 <b>A</b> and <b>Ago</b> 1 B containing an insertion sequence in the PIWI domain, were significantly up-regulated in lymphoid organ and hemolymph, and also upon white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) challenge, indicating the involvement of <b>Ago</b> 1 <b>A</b> and <b>Ago</b> 1 B in antiviral immunity. The results showed that silencing of <b>Ago</b> 1 <b>A</b> with a sequence-specific siRNA led to a significant increase of WSSV loads. It was revealed that knockdown of Ago 1 B mRNA by 37 – 70 % resulted in higher virus loads in shrimp. However, upon silencing Ago 1 B by more than 85 %, a two-fold increase in <b>Ago</b> 1 <b>A</b> mRNA was observed but viral load was the same as untreated controls challenged with WSSV, suggesting that the simultaneous up-regulation of <b>Ago</b> 1 <b>A</b> might compensate for the loss of Ago 1 B. These data indicated that <b>Ago</b> 1 <b>A</b> played more important roles in the antiviral immune response than Ago 1 B. The simultaneous inhibition of <b>Ago</b> 1 <b>A</b> and <b>Ago</b> 1 B resulted in a greater increase in viral loads than <b>Ago</b> 1 <b>A</b> or <b>Ago</b> 1 B alone, indicating that <b>Ago</b> 1 <b>A</b> and <b>Ago</b> 1 B isoforms were involved in shrimp antiviral immunity.

5|$|The {{date of the}} {{appearance}} of smallpox is not settled. It most likely evolved from a terrestrial African rodent virus between 68,000 and 16,000 years ago. The wide range of dates {{is due to the}} different records used to calibrate the molecular clock. One clade was the variola major strains (the more clinically severe form of smallpox) which spread from Asia between 400 and 1,600 years <b>ago.</b> <b>A</b> second clade included both alastrim minor (a phenotypically mild smallpox) described from the American continents and isolates from West Africa which diverged from an ancestral strain between 1,400 and 6,300 years before present. This clade further diverged into two subclades at least 800 years <b>ago.</b> <b>A</b> second estimate has placed the separation of variola from Taterapox at 3000–4000 years ago. This is consistent with archaeological and historical evidence regarding {{the appearance}} of smallpox as a human disease which suggests a relatively recent origin. However, if the mutation rate is assumed to be {{similar to that of the}} herpesviruses, the divergence date between variola from Taterapox has been estimated to be 50,000 years ago. While this is consistent with the other published estimates, it suggests that the archaeological and historical evidence is very incomplete. Better estimates of mutation rates in these viruses are needed.|$|E

5|$|Although {{generally}} Earth's {{field is}} approximately dipolar, with an axis that is nearly {{aligned with the}} rotational axis, occasionally the North and South geomagnetic poles trade places.

Reversals occur nearly randomly in time, with intervals between reversals ranging from less than 0.1 million years to as much as 50 million years.
