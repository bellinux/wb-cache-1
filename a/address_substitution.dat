The prison with the chapel of the Assumption of the Virgin from the 18 th century is a significant building of about one city block large. The project includes the modification of the original prison building and its extension, {{the removal of the}} unsuitable parts of the building and building of new objects connected to the prison and public places. The group of buildings has been designed with the regard to the alternative culture and forms of living places, which would lead to healing of the Roman ghetto. New arrangement and size of objects form two new squares. It reveals the prison in its original shape at the same time.

40|$|It {{is rather}} paradoxical, {{in a world}} so heavily {{concerned}} with the implications of hypercholesterolemia, that also hypocholesterolemia represents an important issue. This {{is the case in}} some categories of subjects, including surgical and critically ill patients. Original observations of hypocholesterolemia in severe illness date {{back to the beginning of}} last century, however the topic and its relationship with abnormal circulating lipoprotein patterns, have been addressed systematically only in recent decades. It has been found that hypocholesterolemia characterizes post-traumatic states and critical illness as a common manifestation of acute phase response. In various conditions there is a variable contribution of different factors in decreasing plasma cholesterol through a decrease in lipoprotein concentration. These include for instance increased need for cholesterol for new cell synthesis and reparative processes, hemodilution from blood loss, hepatic dysfunction and the cholesterol-lowering effect of inflammatory mediators. Thus severity of hypocholesterolemia may reflect the cumulative impact of multiple “adverse” factors: this explains how degree of hypocholesterolemia may become a cumulative index of severity of illness, with important prognostic implications. It must be specified, however, that in the presence of cholestasis the decrease in cholesterol related to the other factors may be moderated. Furthermore, with regard to outcome, it is the persistence of severe hypocholesterolemia that has the worst prognostic implications. Finally, with regard to therapeutic implications, it is not yet clear whether hypocholesterolemia just passively reflects adverse events, or it does actively contribute to worsening of the disease. Modern lines of research address the possibility that cholesterol be a conditionally essential substrate in critical illness, and also <b>address</b> <b>substitution</b> therapy with exogenous fat in sepsis, where hypocholesterolemia and hypolipoproteinemia may impair endotoxin binding and neutralization...|$|E
40|$|A {{resilience}} {{strategy is}} introduced for networks implementing dual homing (dual parenting) of customers, specifically those employing Long-Reach PONs (LR-PONs). Assuming that some mechanism exists to detect network element failures, the discussion {{concentrates on the}} protocols which propagate information about the reachability of LR-PONs and those that re-route traffic {{in the event of}} a fault. A protocol called FROTH (Fast Recovery for OLTs via Transmission of Hellos) informs each edge router which LR-PONs are available over the whole network. This information is used by another protocol called LATTE (Label and Address Tunneling via Tables at the Edge), to re-route traffic in the event of failure. A target of 50 milliseconds is assumed for end-to-end recovery time, since this has been used for many years with voice services, and is adopted in the absence of other information. Here, FROTH transports signaling traffic over IP – due to the probabilistic nature of packet transmission, it is impossible to place a hard bound on recovery time, but rather the probability is calculated that it will be met. Modeling studies suggest that {{in the event of a}} cable failure or single equipment element failure, re-routed data will almost always leave the transmitting edge router in under 50 milliseconds. For more catastrophic failures (such as router failure or loss of an edge router), recovery might take between 100 – 200 milliseconds. Reachability information for each LR-PON is distributed over each area of the network by IP, and used to activate re-routing of traffic via tunnels or <b>address</b> <b>substitution.</b> However the underlying services need not use IP, and may be of any type (for example private line), making the scheme separate from the service, customer or provider...|$|E

40|$|Existing {{estimates}} of the income elasticity suggest that, {{in the absence of}} price increases, US imports will eventually exceed US income. That the United States will change from being a largely self-sufficient economy to one that cannot cover its imports has received {{a great deal of attention}} in developing models for imports: allowance for simultaneity in the import market, recognition of dynamic adjustments and optimization, disaggregation of imports across product and countries, removal of measurement errors in official data, and differentiation between cyclical and secular forces. I show that previous methods to resolve the puzzle, though insightful, are not successful: three decades of methodological improvements in modeling and estimation yield estimated income elasticities for imports much greater than one. I resolve this puzzling estimate by removing the representative-agent assumption and <b>addressing</b> the <b>substitution</b> bias embodied in official import prices stemming from their exclusion of new products. I follow Feenstra to <b>address</b> the <b>substitution</b> bias induced by the omission of new-products' prices. To remove the representative-agent assumption, I start with an individual's demand for imports depending on income and relative prices. Then, consistent aggregation of the micro relations yields a macro equation with income, relative prices, and the variances of the distributions of imports, income, and relative prices. These variances embody individuals' heterogeneity which I model using the share of foreign-born individuals in the United States. For parameter estimation, I use the cointegration method of Johansen (1988). Recognizing either the substitution biases in import prices or the heterogeneity induced by immigration point to unitary income elasticities. Excluding these factors and using the conventional model yields estimated income elasticities much greater than one. ...|$|R

40|$|Advances in {{high-throughput}} {{next-generation sequencing}} (NGS) technologies have enabled {{the determination of}} millions of nucleotide sequences in massive parallelism at affordable costs. Many studies have shown increased error rates over Sanger sequencing, in sequencing data produced by mainstream next-generation sequencing platforms, and have demonstrated the negative impacts of sequencing errors {{on a wide range}} of applications of NGS. Thus, it is critically important for primary analysis of sequencing data to produce accurate, high-quality nucleotides for downstream bioinformatics pipelines. Two bioinformatics problems are dedicated to the direct removal of sequencing errors: base-calling and error-correction. However, existing error correction methods are mostly algorithmic and heuristics. Few methods can address insertion and deletion errors, the dominant error type produced by many platforms. On the other hand, most base-callers do not model the underlying genome structures of the sequencing data, which are necessary for improving base-calling quality especially in low-quality regions. The sequential application of base-caller and error-corrector do not fully offset their shortcomings. In recognition of these issues, in this dissertation, we propose a probabilistic framework that closely emulate the sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) process adopted by many NGS platforms. The core idea is to model sequencing data (individual reads, or fluorescent intensities) as independent emissions from a Hidden Markov model (HMM) with transition distributions to model local and double-stranded dependence in the genome, and emission distributions to model the subtle error characteristics of the sequencers. Deriving from this backbone, we develop three novel methods for improving the data quality of high-throughput sequencing: 1) PREMIER, an accurate probabilistic error corrector of substitution errors in Illumina data, 2) PREMIER-bc, an integrated base-caller and error corrector that significantly improves base-calling quality, and 3) PREMIER-indel, an extended error correction method that <b>addresses</b> <b>substitution,</b> insertion and deletion errors for SBS-based sequencers with good empirical performance. Our foray of using probabilistic methods for base-calling and error correction provides the immediate benefits to downstream analyses with increased sequencing data quality, and more importantly, a flexible and fully-probabilistic basis to go beyond primary analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to substantiate the necessity for Russia to adopt a neo-industrialization policy as a tool for overcoming the consequences of the global crisis. The research hypothesis assumes that the competitiveness of Russian regions in crisis conditions cannot be enhanced without transforming the regional innovation priorities with regard to modern science and technology developments, production demands for modernization and import substitution, and accelerated the formation of the high technology sector. The authors believe that {{one of the main reasons}} for the current structural crisis in Russia is ignoring the determining impact of the innovations and technology development on the country’s regional socio-economic systems as a whole. The verification of this hypothesis based on the analysis of the official statistics revealed a number of negative tendencies impeding the country in overcoming the crisis phenomena through accelerated development of modern technological paradigms: decreasing staff component and deteriorating quality of the Russian science, widening the gap between the financial support in Russia and developed countries, reducing opportunities for innovation business development, and a lack of motivation for manufacturers to engage in innovation activities. The authors substantiate the necessity to strengthen the state innovation policy for the recovery of Russia’s socio-economic situation. They propose a methodological approach to choosing the priorities of innovation support for the economic development of Russian regions based on a comprehensive review of the condition and challenges in the development of research potential, the region’s business environment, and its ability to master innovations.

40|$|Fullerene epoxides, C 60 On, having epoxide groups {{directly}} {{attached to}} the fullerene cage, constitute an interesting class of fullerene derivatives. In particular, the chemical transformations of fullerene epoxides are expected {{to play an important}} role in the development of functionalized fullerenes. This is because such transformations can readily afford a variety of mono- or polyfunctionalized fullerene derivatives while conserving the epoxy ring arrangement on the fullerene surface, as seen in representative regioisomeric fullerene polyepoxides. The first part of this review addresses the synthesis and structural characterization of fullerene epoxides. The formation of fullerene epoxides through different oxidation reactions is then explored. Adequate characterization of the isolated fullerene epoxides was achieved by concerted use of NMR and LC-MS techniques. The second part of this review <b>addresses</b> the <b>substitution</b> of fullerene epoxides in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst. Most major substitution products have been isolated as pure compounds and their structures established through spectroscopic methods. The correlation between the structure of the substitution product and the oxygenation pattern of the starting materials allows elucidation of the mechanistic features of this transformation. This approach promises to lead to rigorous regioselective production of various fullerene derivatives for a wide range of applications...|$|R
40|$|This paper <b>addresses</b> selectivity, <b>substitution</b> and {{complementarity}} {{of elderly}} support options in Bangladesh, a nation undergoing simultaneous mobility and aging transitions {{in an environment}} of limited economic change. Employing detailed qualitative analysis and descriptive quantitative results, the work suggests that while households execute conscious strategies of fertility control and human capital in response to socio-economic change, they must also manage the associated risk through more extensive use of existing social resources for personal support and care. In detailing this process, the paper introduces two interlocking hierarchies of financial and personal support. In these hierarchies, parents exercise two predominant preferences, favoring sons over other children and favoring linkage of sources of primary financial and personal support. When strategies fail or preferred children emphasize financial support over personal care, parents mobilize personal and financial support from sources at lower levels of the hierarchy. While the research finds that support mechanisms are highly adaptable to demographic transition and economic crisis, mechanisms in the current era still depend on higher fertility, lower longevity, and lower mobility that can be anticipated in the next generation. They also may generate unintended economic consequences such as inequality and disinvestment. The results support an agenda to better understand the "fuzzy logic" of family formation under a regime of informality, transition, and constraint. ...|$|R

40|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1970 s, ecologists began {{unraveling}} the role of recently extinct large vertebrates in evolutionary ecology and ecosystem dynamics. Three decades later, practitioners are now considering the role of ecological history in conservation practice, and some have called for restoring missing ecological functions and evolutionary potential using taxon substitutes - extant, functionally similar taxa - to replace extinct species. This pro-active approach to biodiversity conservation has proved controversial. Yet, rewilding with taxon substitutes, or ecological analogues, is now being integrated into conservation and restoration programmes around the world. Empirical evidence is emerging that illustrates how taxon substitutions can restore missing ecological functions and evolutionary potential. However, a major roadblock to a broader evaluation and application of taxon substitution {{is the lack of}} practical guidelines within which they should be conducted. While the International Union for Conservation of Nature 2 ̆ 7 s reintroduction guidelines are an obvious choice, they are unsuitable in their current form. We recommend necessary amendments to these guidelines to explicitly <b>address</b> taxon <b>substitutions.</b> A second impediment to empirical evaluations of rewilding with taxon substitutions is the sheer scale of some proposed projects; the majority involves large mammals over large areas. We present and discuss evidence that large and giant tortoises (family Testudinidae) are a useful model to rapidly provide empirical assessments of the use of taxon substitutes on a comparatively smaller scale. Worldwide, at least 36 species of large and giant tortoises went extinct since the late Pleistocene, leaving 32 extant species. We examine the latent conservation potential, benefits, and risks of using tortoise taxon substitutes as a strategy for restoring dysfunctional ecosystems. We highlight how, especially on islands, conservation practitioners are starting to employ extant large tortoises in ecosystems to replace extinct tortoises that once played keystone roles. © 2010 The Authors.

It comprises two discreet bodies {{of work that}} address the spectrum of drug use from marginalized populations with injecting drug use and opioid dependence to generally healthier, less stigmatized, out of treatment drug users associated with dance music scene. Both populations face a dynamic spectrum of risks that may, to varying degrees, be modifiable by behavioural change and education which may lead to tangible improvements {{in the delivery of}} health services and treatment outcomes. The first part of this thesis comprises 2 book chapters, 11 peer reviewed publications and 3 letters addressing the epidemiology and risks associated with drug use amongst those associated with the dance music scene in the United Kingdom In 1999 I commenced a serial study of club drug use through the use of an annual survey in a popular dance music magazine. This 7 year project generated 9 data based peer reviewed publications. During the study period over 5000 participants completed a questionnaire that addressed a number of drug related issues including patterns and prevalence of substance use and associated risk behaviours including alcohol use and high risk sexual practises. The serial collection of data permitted time trend analysis to be performed and demonstrated the utility of such approaches in the detection of emerging drug trends and the appearance novel substances of abuse such as 4 -MTA. The second section comprises 2 book chapters, 18 published papers and 2 letters. The research papers focus on 2 aspects of opioid treatment. The first series(papers 15 - 27) concern the range and structure of service provision for those with opioid dependence within the public health system in Australia (and to the lesser extent the UK) and consumers' satisfaction, knowledge and understanding of that treatment.

These ternary compounds have the general formula AMxT 13 -x, where A = Ba, Sr, La, Eu, M = Cu and Ag, and T = Al, Ga, and In, with 5 ≤ x ≤ 6. 5, and have been structurally characterized by both powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, XPS, and EDS measurements are reported {{for some of the}} samples. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments on BaCu 5 Al 8 (BaCu 5. 10 (7) Al 7. 90 (7), cubic, a = 12. 205 (4) Å, Z = 8) and EuCu 6. 5 Al 6. 5 (EuCu 6. 41 (5) Al 6. 59 (5), cubic, a = 11. 928 (1) Å, Z = 8) indicate that the quasi-infinite three-dimensional [CuxAl 13 -x] framework involves mostly Cu atoms centering icosahedra, with its vertexes randomly occupied by the remaining Cu and Al atoms. On the other hand, when M = Ag, Al shows a greater tendency to occupy the center of the icosahedra. A systematic study of the compositional variation in BaCuxAl 13 -x demonstrates that the NaZn 13 type phase exists within a narrow range of x between five and six. To examine the role of the cation A in stabilizing this structure, quaternary phases, e. g., BaSrAg 12 Al 14 (BaSrAg 12. 0 (1) Al 14. 0 (1), cubic, a = 12. 689 (1) Å, Z = 4) and SrCeCu 12 Al 14 (SrCeCu 11. 74 (2) Al 14. 26 (2), cubic, a = 11. 938 (1) Å, Z = 4), were prepared and characterized.

Initially, we developed a novel method to accurately determine molar quantities of each variant by expressing them as green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins and using recombinant adenoviruses to facilitate transient infection of human microvascular endothelial cells. Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting of eNOSAsp revealed a 135 -kDa proteolytic fragment which was not present with eNOSGlu. This proteolysis was prevented by using LDS buffer confirming that this differential cleavage is an artefact of sample preparation and unlikely to occur intracellularly.

40|$|Short-term whole {{effluent}} toxicity testing, {{which is}} currently a requirement of the U. S. EPA`s National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), commonly uses the cladoceran species Ceriodaphnia dubia. Despite the advantages to using a common test species to model the toxic effects of effluents, {{it could be argued}} that toxicity test results would be more meaningful if a wider variety of test organisms were commonly used. One particular argument against C. dubia is that tests conducted with this species do not always reflect local, site-specific conditions. The careful selection and use of an indigenous test species would produce a more realistic model of local instream effects and would account for regional differences in water quality. Permitted effluent discharges from Savannah River Site (SRS), a government weapons facility operated by the U. S. Department of Energy, require toxicity testing with C. dubia. However, water quality in these receiving streams is markedly different (lower pH and hardness) from standard laboratory water used for the culturing and testing of C. dubia, and it has been shown that this receiving water presents varying degrees of toxicity to C. dubia. Based on these results, it is possible that toxic effects observed during an effluent study could be the result of test organism stress from the dilution water and not the effects of SRS effluents. Therefore, this study <b>addressed</b> the <b>substitution</b> of C. dubia with an indigenous cladoceran species, Daphnia ambigua for routine regulatory testing at SRS. Given the indigenous nature of this species, combined with the fact that it has been successfully cultured by other investigators, D. ambigua was ideal for consideration as a replacement for C. dubia, but further study of the overall success and sensitivity of laboratory-reared D. ambigua was required. This investigation determined that D. ambigua could be laboratory cultured with only minimal changes to established regulatory protocol and that the life-cycle characteristics of this species were conducive to traditional acute and chronic aquatic toxicity test methods. Acute toxicity tests showed that when comparing LC 50 values for C. dubia and D. ambigua, D. ambigua was less sensitive to some toxicants (sodium chloride, copper sulfate, and sodium lauryl sulfate) while more sensitive to others (chlorpyrifos). Results of chronic tests with copper sulfate and sodium chloride resulted in the same NOEC/LOEC values for both species. When exposed to unaltered SRS stream water, C. dubia demonstrated a `toxic` response for two of the three streams tested, while reproduction for D. ambigua was higher in all stream samples. Acute toxicity tests with sodium chloride in stream water, generally followed the sensitivity trend noted in tests conducted with regular laboratory water...|$|R
