25|$|In England {{from the}} 1630s, under the {{influence}} of literature and especially court masques, Anthony van Dyck and his followers created a fashion for having one's portrait painted in exotic, historical or pastoral dress, or in simplified contemporary fashion with various scarves, cloaks, mantles, and jewels added to evoke a classic or romantic mood, and also to prevent the portrait appearing dated within a few years. These paintings are the progenitors of the fashion of the later 17th century for having one's portrait painted in undress, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> reflect clothing as it was actually worn.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{individuals}} having a constant blood volume, {{one of the}} physiological ways to deliver more oxygen to an organ is to increase heart rate to permit blood to pass by the organ more often. Normal resting heart rates range from 60–100 bpm. Bradycardia {{is defined as a}} resting heart rate below 60 bpm. However, heart rates from 50 to 60 bpm are common among healthy people <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> require special attention. Tachycardia is defined as a resting heart rate above 100 bpm, though persistent rest rates between 80–100 bpm, mainly if they are present during sleep, may be signs of hyperthyroidism or anemia (see below).|$|E
25|$|Sign {{languages}} are not mime—in other words, signs are conventional, often arbitrary <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> have a visual relationship to their referent, much as most spoken {{language is not}} onomatopoeic.

This {{does not mean that}} sign {{languages are}} a visual rendition of a spoken language. They have complex grammars of their own and can be used to discuss any topic, from the simple and concrete to the lofty and abstract.|$|E
25|$|A hyeong is a systematic, {{prearranged}} {{sequence of}} martial techniques that is performed either {{with or without}} the use of a weapon. In dojangs (taekwondo training gymnasiums) hyeong are used primarily as a form of interval training that is useful in developing mushin, proper kinetics and mental and physical fortitude. Hyeong may resemble combat, but are artistically non-combative and woven together so as to be an effective conditioning tool. One's aptitude for a particular hyeong may be evaluated in competition. In such competitions, hyeong are evaluated by a panel of judges who base the score on many factors including energy, precision, speed, and control. In Western competitions, there are two general classes of hyeong: creative and standard. Creative hyeong are created by the performer and are generally acrobatic in nature <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> reflect the kinetic principles intrinsic in any martial system.|$|E

25|$|There is {{some debate}} whether {{certain types of}} sexual sensations should be {{accurately}} classified as orgasms, including female orgasms caused by G-spot stimulation alone, and the demonstration of extended or continuous orgasms lasting several minutes or even an hour. The question centers around the clinical definition of orgasm, but this way of viewing orgasm is merely physiological, while there are also psychological, endocrinological, and neurological definitions of orgasm. In these and similar cases, the sensations experienced are subjective <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> involve the involuntary contractions characteristic of orgasm. However, the sensations in both sexes are extremely pleasurable and are often felt throughout the body, causing a mental state that {{is often described as}} transcendental, and with vasocongestion and associated pleasure comparable to that of a full-contractionary orgasm. For example, modern findings support distinction between ejaculation and male orgasm. For this reason, there are views on both sides as to whether these can be accurately defined as orgasms.|$|E
25|$|There are no {{official}} statistics of people's religious beliefs {{nor is it}} asked in the census. According to the government, 99.8% of the Turkish population is Muslim, mostly Sunni, some 10 to 15 million are Alevis. The remaining 0.2% is other - mostly Christians and Jews. However, these {{are based on the}} existing religion information written on every citizen's national id card, that is automatically passed on from the parents to every newborn, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> represent individual choice. Furthermore, anyone who was not officially registered as Christian or Jewish {{by the time of the}} foundation of the republic, was automatically recorded as Muslim, and this label has been passed down to new generations. Therefore, the official number of Muslims also include people with no religion; converted from Islam to a different religion than Islam; and anyone who is of a different religion than their parents, but hasn't applied for a change of their individual records. It should also be noted that the state allow the individual records to be changed and can have their religion information removed from the identification card, but such change doesn't affect the official record.|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} {{processes}} do not necessarily occur in a single environment, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> occur in a single order. The Hawaiian Islands, for example, consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows. The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since Cambrian time. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older rocks, such as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada, the oldest known rock {{in the world have}} been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis. In addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited. Although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, these concepts provide a guide to understanding the geological history of an area.|$|E

25|$|Mirtazapine {{does not}} have serotonergic {{activity}} and does not cause serotonergic side effects or serotonin syndrome. This is {{in accordance with the}} fact that it is not a serotonin reuptake inhibitor or MAOI, nor a serotonin receptor agonist. There are no reports of serotonin syndrome in association with mirtazapine alone, and mirtazapine has not been found to cause serotonin syndrome in overdose. However, there are a handful of case reports of serotonin syndrome occurring with mirtazapine in combination with serotonergic drugs like SSRIs, although such reports are unusual, very rare, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> implicate mirtazapine as causative. The addition of mirtazapine to an MAOI does not cause serotonin syndrome, and has been considered to be a safe combination. Moreover, mirtazapine may actually be useful in the treatment of serotonin syndrome, with at least one publication finding it to be effective in resolving the syndrome. This is in accordance with the fact that the 5-HT2A receptor is the predominant serotonin receptor thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of serotonin syndrome (with the 5-HT1A receptor seeming to be protective). Mirtazapine is a potent 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, and cyproheptadine, a drug that shares this property, mediates recovery from serotonin syndrome and is well-established clinically as an antidote against it.|$|E

2500|$|In the 20th and 21st centuries, {{questions}} arose {{regarding the}} effectiveness of the invasion strategy in neutralizing non-state combatants, a type of warfare sometimes referred to as [...] "fourth generation warfare". In this case, one or more combatant groups are controlled not by a centralized state government but by independent leadership, and these groups may be made up of civilians, foreign agents, mercenaries, politicians, religious leaders, and members of the regular military. These groups act in smaller numbers, are not confined by borders, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> depend on the direct support of the state. Groups such as these are not easily defeated by straightforward invasion, or even constant occupation; the country's regular army may be defeated, the government may be replaced, but asymmetric warfare on the part of these groups can be continued indefinitely. Because regular armed forces units do not have the flexibility and independence of small covert cells, many believe that the concept of a powerful occupying force actually creates a disadvantage.|$|E
2500|$|As {{in other}} novels by Vonnegut, certain {{characters}} cross over from other stories, making cameo appearances and connecting the discrete novels {{to a greater}} opus. Fictional novelist Kilgore Trout, often an important character in other Vonnegut novels, in Slaughterhouse-Five is a social commentator and a friend to Billy Pilgrim. In one case, {{he is the only}} non-optometrist at a party, therefore, he is the odd-man-out. He ridicules everything the Ideal American Family holds true, such as Heaven, Hell, and Sin. In Trout's opinion, people do not know if the things they do turn out to be good or bad, and if they turn out to be bad, they go to Hell, where [...] "the burning never stops hurting." [...] Other crossover characters are Eliot Rosewater, from God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater; Howard W. Campbell, Jr., from Mother Night; and Bertram Copeland Rumfoord, relative of Winston Niles Rumfoord, from The Sirens of Titan. While Vonnegut re-uses characters, the characters are frequently rebooted <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> maintain the same biographical details from appearance to appearance. Kilgore Trout in particular is palpably a different person (although with distinct, consistent character traits) in each of his appearances in Vonnegut's work.|$|E
