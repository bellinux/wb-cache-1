5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The first time we met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, he dropped his head, as he sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have nothing to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E

When my comrades took farewell to me, I was equally moved <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> ever been when I was given an important office.

25|$|Immediately on our {{coming up}} out of the water after we had been baptized, we {{experienced}} great and glorious blessings from our Heavenly Father. No sooner had I baptized Oliver Cowdery, than the Holy Ghost fell upon him, and he stood up and prophesied many things which should shortly come to pass. And again, so soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been baptized by him, I also had the spirit of prophecy, when, standing up, I prophesied concerning the rise of this Church, and many other things connected with the Church, and this generation of the children of men. We were filled with the Holy Ghost, and rejoiced in the God of our salvation.|$|E
25|$|We were {{scarcely}} a musket-shot from the shore, when the captain {{pointed out to}} me one of the midshipmen in the boat, of the name of Lockhart, asking me if I knew his family in Scotland. I answered in the negative, telling him that I had never been in any other service than that of Mrs. Gray. I was uneasy lest Mr. Lockhart should have recognized me for, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been a schoolfellow of his elder brother and frequently in the house of his father, Mr. Lockhart of Carnwath, he might very possibly have known me. He was about eighteen years of age and had been four years in the navy. His eldest brother, the heir to a considerable estate, had been foolish enough, like so many others, to join the standard of Prince Charles.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, Farmer {{focused the}} efforts of the {{institution}} on Bahá'í themes. In her words in 1902:My joy in the Persian Revelation is not that it reveals one of the streams flowing to the great Ocean of Life, Light and Love, but that it is a perfect mirror of that Ocean. What, in Green Acre, was a vision and a hope becomes, through it a blessed reality now. It has illuminated for me every other expression of Truth which I had hitherto known and place my feet on a Rock from which they cannot be moved. And it is the Manifestation of the Fatherhood - Behá'u'lláh (ed - as it was spelled in those days) - who had taught me to look away from even the Greatest and find within the One 'Powerful, Mighty, and Supreme' who is to be the Redeemer of my life. It is a Revelation of Unity such <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never before found. By means of its Light, as shown the life of the Master Abbas Abdul Beha, I have entered into a joy greater than any I have hitherto known. Green Acre was established as a means to that end and in proportion as well lay aside all spirit of criticism of others and seek only to live the Unity we find, shall we be able to help others to the same divine realization.|$|E

Richard later recalled, [...] "There were other guys in my high school with as much ability <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had,</b> but instead of working at a job, they wanted to drink wine on Saturday nights.

500|$|In 1968 Le Mesurier {{was offered}} a role in a new BBC {{situation}} comedy playing an upper-class Sergeant Arthur Wilson in Dad's Army, although he was the second choice after Robert Dorning. Le Mesurier was unsure about taking the part as he was finishing the final series of George and the Dragon {{and did not want}} another long-term television role. He was persuaded both by an increase in his fee—to £26210s (£262.50) per episode—and by the casting of his old friend Clive Dunn as Corporal Jones. Le Mesurier was initially unsure of how to portray his character, and was advised by series writer Jimmy Perry to make the part his own. Le Mesurier decided to base the character on himself, later writing that [...] "I thought, why not just be myself, use an extension of my own personality and behave rather <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done in the army? So I always left a button or two undone, and had the sleeve of my battle dress slightly turned up. I spoke softly, issued commands as if they were invitations (the sort not likely to be accepted) and generally assumed a benign air of helplessness". Perry later observed that [...] "we wanted Wilson to be the voice of sanity; he has become John".|$|E
500|$|Christina Lee from Idolator {{noted that}} [...] "Stefani hiccups through her lyrics like Rihanna does in 2012's Sia-written [...] "Diamonds", {{save for the}} Love.Angel.Music.Baby-ready sung-rap breakdown". However, Lee {{observed}} that, [...] "Considering the song's subject matter, her bold-faced collaborators (Ryan Tedder, Benny Blanco and Noel Zancanella) and, of course, her own track record, Stefani's new song isn't nearly as assertive <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> expected." [...] Brennan Carley of Spin simply called it [...] "a pretty broadly pop effort in line with 2012's No Doubt record, Push and Shove." [...] Lucas Villa of AXS was mixed with the song, writing that [...] "Gwen had always been ahead of the pop curve on her past two albums but 'Baby Don't Lie' sees her on par with everyone else currently on the charts." [...] Mike Ayers of The Wall Street Journal believed that Gwen [...] "doesn't sound too inspired here," [...] while Carolyn Menyes of Music Times disagreed, noting that the song [...] "doesn't seem to have quite the infectious annoyance of some of Stefani's other works, but it's a more solid, well-rounded pop single". Menyes also praised [...] "her signature sassy, slightly reggae-touched vocals, which according to herself, sells the emotions of this song." [...] Steven J. Horowitz from Billboard noted {{that even though the}} song [...] "embraces her [...] less experimental side," [...] it misses her [...] "signature bite", rating it three stars out of five.|$|E

I mean, {{if you were going}} to bring Floyd back and name the episode after him, it would have been nice to give [...] a little spark." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin gave it a C rating, calling it [...] a disappointing episode. In regards to Jason Sudeikis, Rabin commented that he is a [...] "gifted comic actor" [...] but this episode [...] "found him at his hammy, embarrassing worst." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, remarked that the episode [...] "may have been the worst one yet", and said that when Floyd [...] called Liz a [...] "badger", her heart broke into smithereens, [...] "There's mean-funny, and then there's plain old mean. [...] Liz's love life has become the central butt of the joke on 30 Rock... and it's starting to feel like the writers have run out of ways to be funny without being sadistic." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said that [...] "Floyd" [...] was not a great episode, [...] "but it's still pretty good by this season's standards, if a somewhat disappointing use of Floyd's return." [...] He explained that part of the episode's problem was that Liz's relationships not succeeding [...] "has become pretty old hat for the show since we've seen it time and time again", and hoped to see her [...] "find a good man and let the show move onto something else for a while." [...] TV Guides Adam Mersel wrote that it [...] "really didn't do it for me. I didn't really laugh out loud much, and the cameo from one of my favorite SNL players came off a bit forced." ...|$|E
