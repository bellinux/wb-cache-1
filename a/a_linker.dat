25|$|<b>A</b> <b>linker</b> {{is a short}} {{amino acid}} {{sequence}} that tethers the fluorescent reporter protein fragment to the protein of interest, forming the fusion protein. When designing <b>a</b> <b>linker</b> sequence, one must ensure that the linker is sufficiently soluble and long to provide the fluorescent protein fragments with flexibility and freedom of movement so that the fragment and its partner fragment will collide frequently enough to reconstitute during the interaction of their respective fused proteins. Although it is not documented, {{it is possible that}} the length or the sequence of the linker may influence complementation of some proteins. Reported linker sequences RSIAT and RPACKIPNDLKQKVMNH (single amino acid code) and AAANSSIDLISVPVDSR (Sigma) have been successfully used in BiFC experiments.|$|E
25|$|A shared {{library or}} shared object is a file that is {{intended}} to be shared by executable files and further shared object files. Modules used by a program are loaded from individual shared objects into memory at load time or run time, rather than being copied by <b>a</b> <b>linker</b> when it creates a single monolithic executable file for the program.|$|E
25|$|When linking is {{performed}} during {{the creation of}} an executable or another object file, it is known as static linking or early binding. In this case, the linking is usually done by <b>a</b> <b>linker,</b> but may also be done by the compiler. A static library, also known as an archive, is one intended to be statically linked. Originally, only static libraries existed. Static linking must be performed when any modules are recompiled.|$|E

25|$|Dynamic loading, {{a subset}} of dynamic linking, {{involves}} a dynamically linked library loading and unloading at run time on request. Such a request may be made implicitly at compile time or explicitly at run time. Implicit requests are made at compile time when <b>a</b> <b>linker</b> adds library references that include file paths or simply file names. Explicit requests are made when applications make direct calls to an operating system's API at run time.|$|E
25|$|Philippe Kahn {{first saw}} an {{opportunity}} for Borland, his newly formed software company, {{in the field of}} programming tools. Historically, the vast majority of programmers saw their workflow in terms of the edit/compile/link cycle, with separate tools dedicated to each task. Programmers wrote source code using a text editor; the source code was then compiled into object code (often requiring multiple passes), and <b>a</b> <b>linker</b> combined object code with runtime libraries to produce an executable program.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent {{fragment}} linkage may {{alter the}} folding or {{structure of the}} protein of interest, leading to the elimination of an interacting protein's surface binding site. In addition, {{the arrangement of the}} fluorescent fragments may prevent fluorophore reconstitution through steric hindrance, although steric hindrance can be reduced or eliminated by using <b>a</b> <b>linker</b> sequence that allows sufficient flexibility for the fluorescent fragments to associate. Therefore, absence of fluorescence complementation may be a false negative and does not necessarily prove that the interaction in question does not occur.|$|E

25|$|Libraries are {{important}} in the program linking or binding process, which resolves references known as links or symbols to library modules. The linking process is usually automatically done by <b>a</b> <b>linker</b> or binder program that searches a set of libraries and other modules in a given order. Usually it is not considered an error if a link target can be found multiple times in a given set of libraries. Linking may be done when an executable file is created, or whenever the program is used at run time.|$|E
25|$|MOFs are {{composed}} of two major components: a metal ion or cluster of metal ions and an organic molecule called <b>a</b> <b>linker.</b> For this reason, the materials are {{often referred to as}} hybrid organic–inorganic materials; however, this terminology has recently been explicitly discouraged. The organic units are typically mono-, di-, tri-, or tetravalent ligands. The choice of metal and linker dictates the structure and hence properties of the MOF. For example, the metal's coordination preference influences {{the size and shape of}} pores by dictating how many ligands can bind to the metal and in which orientation.|$|E
25|$|Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) {{comprise}} an antibody, {{drug and}} <b>a</b> <b>linker</b> between them. The antibody will be targeted at a preferentially expressed protein in the tumour cells (known as a tumor antigen) or on cells that the tumor can utilise, such as blood vessel endothelial cells. They bind to the tumor antigen and are internalised, where the linker releases the drug into the cell. These specially targeted delivery vehicles {{vary in their}} stability, selectivity, and choice of target, but, in essence, they all aim to increase the maximum effective dose that can be delivered to the tumor cells. Reduced systemic toxicity means that {{they can also be}} used in sicker patients, and that they can carry new chemotherapeutic agents that would have been far too toxic to deliver via traditional systemic approaches.|$|E

In cases where lld is insufficient, another linker such as GNU ld can be used.|$|R

50|$|Cordon-bleu protein, uses two WH2 motifs (blue segment) for the {{recruitment}} of ATP-actin monomers (dark orange) to form a linear actin dimer (Fig. 3). <b>A</b> short <b>linker</b> (short green segment) permits a close association between the linearly arranged actin subunits; <b>a</b> longer <b>linker</b> (long green segment) permits a third ATP-actin monomer to bind to the most carboxy-terminal WH2 motif to assemble in a cross-filament orientation, creating a trimeric actin nucleus.|$|R
25|$|Ricin is {{synthesized}} in the endosperm of {{castor oil}} plant seeds. The ricin precursor protein is 576 amino acid residues {{in length and}} contains a signal peptide (residues 1–35), the ricin A chain (36–302), <b>a</b> <b>linker</b> peptide (303–314), and the ricin B chain (315–576). The N-terminal signal sequence delivers the prepropolypeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then the signal peptide is cleaved off. Within the lumen of the ER the propolypeptide is glycosylated and a protein disulfide isomerase catalyzes disulfide bond formation between cysteines 294 and 318. The propolypeptide is further glycosylated within the Golgi apparatus and transported to protein storage bodies. The propolypeptide is cleaved within protein bodies by an endopeptidase to produce the mature ricin protein that is composed of a 267 residue A chain and a 262 residue B chain that are covalently linked by a single disulfide bond.|$|E
25|$|The myosin-binding protein C, cardiac-type is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the MYBPC3 gene. cMyBP-C is a myosin-associated protein that binds at 43nm {{intervals}} along the myosin thick filament backbone, stretching for 200nm {{on either side}} of the M-line within the crossbridge-bearing zone (C-region) of the A band in striated muscle. The approximate stoichiometry of cMyBP-C along the thick filament is 1 per 9-10 myosin molecules, or 37 cMyBP-C molecules per thick filament. In addition to myosin, cMyBP-C also binds titin and actin. The cMyBP-C isoform expressed in cardiac muscle differs from those expressed in slow and fast skeletal muscle (MYBPC1 and MYBPC2, respectively) by three features: (1) an additional immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain on the N-terminus, (2) <b>a</b> <b>linker</b> region between the second and third Ig domains, and (3) an additional loop in the sixth Ig domain. cMyBP-C appears necessary for normal order, filament length and lattice spacing within the structure of the sarcomere.|$|E
2500|$|Another major {{contributor}} to the modern library concept {{came in the form}} of the subprogram innovation of FORTRAN. FORTRAN subprograms can be compiled independently of each other, but the compiler lacked <b>a</b> <b>linker.</b> [...] So prior to the introduction of modules in Fortran-90, type checking between FORTRAN subprograms was impossible.|$|E
5000|$|The {{choice of}} linker {{between the two}} oxazolidine rings has a large impact on the {{performance}} when used to cure isocyanates. <b>A</b> rigid <b>linker</b> group increases <b>a</b> polyurethanes toughness. <b>A</b> flexible <b>linker</b> group imparts flexibility and increases elongation of a coating. These differences are the reason why bisoxazolidines are used to enhance the performance of polyurethane systems. Usually the rings are linked by esters, urethanes, carbonate or have the two rings fused together.|$|R
30|$|Low-linking constructions such as tough/middle constructions, low {{adverbial}} verb constructions, {{subject and}} object control constructions, and resultative constructions are insensitive to extraction patterns. These constructions {{are characterized by}} the Type B and Type C low linkers. In these constructions, <b>a</b> low <b>linker</b> does not introduce finite clauses. In addition, <b>a</b> low <b>linker</b> cannot take <b>a</b> pseudo-cleft clause and a topic clause. Wh-clauses, as in (64), and topic clauses, as in (65), cannot occur after the low linkers.|$|R

2500|$|Example of primer {{designed}} {{to add a}} 6xHis-tag using PCR. Eighteen bases coding six histidines are inserted right after the START codon or right before the STOP codon. At least 16 bases specific to the gene of interest are needed next to the His-tag. With 6 His, the protein will have an added 1 kDa of molecular weight. Note: often, <b>a</b> <b>linker</b> (such as gly-gly-gly or gly-ser-gly) is placed between the protein of interest and the 6 His tag. [...] This is to prevent the polyhistidine tag from affecting {{the activity of the}} protein being tagged.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, Ghosh et al {{developed}} {{a system that}} allowed a green fluorescent protein (GFP) to be reassembled using an anti-parallel leucine zipper in E. coli cells. This was achieved by dissecting GFP into C- and N-terminal GFP fragments. As the GFP fragment was attached to each leucine zipper by <b>a</b> <b>linker,</b> the heterodimerisation of the anti-parallel leucine zipper resulted in a reconstituted, or re-formed, GFP protein that could be visualised. [...] The successful fluorescent signal indicated that the separate GFP peptide fragments were able to correctly reassemble and achieve tertiary folding. It was, therefore, postulated that using this technique, fragmented GFP {{could be used to}} study interaction of protein–protein pairs that have their N–C termini in close proximity.|$|E
2500|$|ABP {{molecules}} {{serve as}} probes to irreversibly bind only to active proteases and ignore their zymogen precursors and inhibited proteases. Placing a reactive group and a recognizable tag feature {{on the same}} molecule using <b>a</b> <b>linker</b> moiety gives an ABP molecule its structure. The reactive molecule, designed after protease inhibitor mechanisms, lends ABPs their specificity towards targeting active proteases. Once bound, the reactive group acts much like an irreversible inhibitor to the protease. Depending {{on the nature of}} the tag moiety, the ABP-protease complex can then be visualized or retrieved from biological samples for further studies of localization and quantification. Limitations including difficult production, specificity, stability, and toxicity hamper ABP development but [...] these probes have proved useful in revealing protease biological activity and remain a promising avenue in degradomic technology.|$|E
40|$|An {{enrichment}} {{strategy was}} devised for azide derivatized macromolecules, based on strain-promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition (SPAAC) and <b>a</b> cleavable <b>linker.</b> <b>A</b> ring-strained alkyne, bicyclo[6. 1. 0]non- 4 -yne (BCN), was covalently attached to agarose beads via <b>a</b> hydrazine-sensitive <b>linker.</b> Benchmark {{studies of the}} resulting 'azido-trap' beads were performed with a fluorogenic coumarin derivative, leading to efficient capture of the azidocoumarin with concomitant fluorescence staining of the beads via SPAAC. The versatility of the beads for specific protein enrichment was shown by an effective and highly specific capture-release strategy for enrichment of azido-containing Candida antarctica lipase B (CalB) from a mixture of proteins. This approach is suited for selective enrichment of (glyco) proteins after metabolic incorporation of azides for subsequent (glyco) proteomics studies...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{methodology}} for making drug conjugates using hyaluronan as a carrier was developed.
