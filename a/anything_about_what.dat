5|$|To {{celebrate}} their six-month anniversary, Long Island socialites Tony and Carlotta Milburn arrange a wild drinking party with friends, {{culminating in a}} stop at the restaurant owned by Faronea. They are unaware that Faronea is conspiring with Baptiste Bouclier, the chauffeur of party host Vic Huling, to kidnap Vic. The next morning the Milburns awake hung over to find Vic dead from a gunshot through the heart and his wife Bette missing. Tony calls his friend, district attorney Danny Harrison to investigate. Bette arrives with Billy Arliss at whose home she had slept. Because of their excessive drinking, no one can remember <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> had happened the night before. As circumstantial evidence mounts against Tony, he calls in hypnotist Professor Karl Jones to help everyone try to recover their memories. Just as the professor is about to reveal the murderer, he is murdered.|$|E
500|$|Skinner {{returns to}} the routing center where he tears {{a hole in the}} {{bathroom}} wall and finds a large honeycomb of dead bees. He visits an entomologist to {{look at one of the}} bees and is told that Mulder visited him six months ago about a similar subject. Skinner finds Mulder's file on the matter, copying down the contact information for Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden). Mulder tells Skinner that a bank near the police station took a picture of the detective, which shows him with Skinner, but the picture is too obscured for Mulder to identify him. Skinner calls Covarrubias, who does not have any evidence to provide him at this time. The entomologist is killed by a swarm of bees. The next day, Mulder and Skinner look at his body, which is infected with smallpox transmitted by the bees. Skinner visits the co-worker of the postal worker who died, who tells him she was pressured to not say <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> happened by men who demanded a damaged package. At the photo lab Mulder analyzes the photo, which reveals Skinner's identity.|$|E
500|$|Ruck had {{previously}} auditioned for the Bender role in The Breakfast Club which went to Judd Nelson, but Hughes remembered Ruck and cast {{him as the}} 17-year-old Cameron Frye. According to Hughes, the character of Cameron was largely based on {{a friend of his}} in high school. [...] "He was sort of a lost person. His family neglected him, so he took that as license to really pamper himself. When he was legitimately sick, he actually felt good, because it was difficult and tiring to have to invent diseases but when he actually had something, he was relaxed." [...] Ruck said the role of Cameron had originally been offered to Emilio Estevez who turned it down. [...] "Every time I see Emilio, I want to kiss him", said Ruck. [...] "Thank you!" [...] Ruck, then 29, worried about the age difference. [...] "I was worried that I'd be 10 years out of step, and I wouldn't know <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> was cool, what was hip, all that junk. But when I was going to high school, I didn't know any of that stuff then, either. So I just thought, well, hellâ€”I'll just be me. The character, he's such a loner that he really wouldn't give a damn about that stuff anyway. He'd feel guilty that he didn't know it, but that's it." [...] Ruck was not surprised to find himself cast young. [...] "No, because, really, when I was 18, I sort of looked 12", he said. [...] "Maybe it's a genetic imbalance." ...|$|E

But you know I've only been in fun--of course I don't know <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>what's</b> {{going to happen to}} us." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. PEARCE. Why not! But {{you don't}} know <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> her. <b>What</b> <b>about</b> her parents? She may be married.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here, Jesse," [...] {{father said}} to me, tearing a strip from {{the sheet and}} {{fastening}} it to an ox-goad. [...] "Take this {{and go out and}} try to talk to that man. Don't tell him <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>what's</b> happened to us. Just try to get him to come in and talk with us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose that}} was it, sir. And now, has {{the captain said}} <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> {{is going to be}} done with the ship till he gets well?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't let {{the matter}} drop. What {{does he mean}} {{when he says that}} he isn't doing {{anything}} that he shouldn't? I've never said <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> he was doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] {{said the}} other, with marked surprise, [...] "I never forgive impertinence, nor can I {{conceive}} what title {{you have to}} hope <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> no way concerns you." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Wraithborn {{power is}} {{normally}} {{given to a}} specially chosen warrior, someone who has trained for decades to wield the power and fight the Immortals. But, due to [...] "unforeseen circumstances", the power is passed on to an ordinary high school girl who doesn't know <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>what's</b> going on, but she's got to figure things out fast {{because a lot of}} [...] "people" [...] (including the Immortals) are coming after her.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{about this}} stranger," [...] said I. [...] "Can {{you tell me}} <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> him? <b>What</b> did Selden say? Did he find out where he hid, or what he was doing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{has got to}} be done, so there's no use in {{thinking}} <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it. <b>What</b> troubles me is how {{you are going to get}} along without food or water while I am gone." ...|$|R
60|$|With {{their weapons}} taken from them, the prisoners {{could do nothing}} but submit. They were questioned, but all refused to tell <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> they had done or {{intended}} to do.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Bartle, pausing, {{with one}} hand on his back. [...] "Then there's {{something}} in the wind--there's something in the wind. Have you heard <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> the old squire means to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{good are}} you to anybody but yourself, never seeing {{anything}} of the Great World and not knowing <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> is going on or what other people are doing?" [...] asked old Mr. Toad.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the way {{it always}} is with you, mamma--you can't do this, and you can't do that--you are so {{excessively}} tiresome! But I will have the dress, I'm determined. He says his sister wears light blue crape of an evening; and I'll have light blue crape, too--see if I don't! I'll get it somehow from the shop, myself. Papa never takes any notice, I'm sure, what I have on; and he needn't find out <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>what's</b> gone out of the shop, until they 'take stock,' {{or whatever it is}} he calls it. And then, if he flies into one of his passions--" ...|$|R
25|$|In the Copenhagen interpretation, the {{mathematics}} {{of quantum mechanics}} allows one to predict probabilities for the occurrence of various events. When an event occurs, it {{becomes part of the}} definite reality, and alternative possibilities do not. There is no necessity to say <b>anything</b> definite <b>about</b> <b>what</b> is not observed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't care <b>{{anything}}</b> <b>about</b> Silas Grantley. <b>What</b> I {{want to know}} is, {{how this}} rascal manages to make {{anything out of the}} political pickings of a town like Leith." ...|$|R
6000|$|Edwards {{turned away}} with shaking hands and {{unsteady}} step. [...] "All right," [...] he said, [...] "I'll meet it." [...] He {{came back to}} say: [...] "There's no need of your saying <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> I've told you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't ask you, Mr. Barnes," [...] he said, [...] "whether {{you know}} <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> has {{happened}} here. You are not bound to say. I hope you don't know, {{and that you}} will be able to prove it. But I must go through the form of arresting you in the King's name for the murder of Colonel Norman Bohun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know. But I haven't {{seen her}} in years; and, after all, she's my sister. And back at the old home, where I went first, no one knew <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> had become of the family except Jane. They kept track of her because she {{suddenly}} became rich, and a great lady, {{and that was a}} surprising thing to happen to a Merrick. We've always been a poor lot, you know." ...|$|E
5000|$|Angel, Spike, and Lorne go to Lindsey's apartment, {{where they}} {{encounter}} Eve. She claims {{not to know}} <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>what's</b> happening to Fred and says that she hasn't heard from Lindsey. Eve sings a little of [...] "L.A. Song" [...] and Lorne determines that she's not involved, though [...] "her future's not too bright." [...] Eve explains that there's no info on the sarcophagus in the firm's records because {{it is one of}} the Old Ones. She suggests they look through the oldest scrolls for information on the Deeper Well. In Wesley's office, he tells the group that the demon in question is called Illyria and it is hollowing Fred out like a shell so that it may return to the world. Angel and Spike travel to England where the Deeper Well is being guarded.|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my word," [...] {{he cried}} at my elbow, [...] "what {{is it to}} me whether women are fools or lunatics? I really don't care {{what you think of}} them. I--I am not {{interested}} in them. I let them be. I am not {{a young man in a}} novel.

6000|$|... "Wait now! What has he {{actually}} {{done in the}} art line? Has he done one first-class picture or--sketch, d' you call it? Or one poem, or played the piano, or <b>anything</b> except gas <b>about</b> <b>what</b> he's going to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> has {{happened}} lately {{so far as}} that claim is concerned," [...] was John Franklin's reply. [...] "But I do know when oil was first discovered in this region some of the experts went over the whole territory carefully {{and they did not}} consider the Spell claim as being of any value. That's the reason no wells were located there. They claimed that the geological formation was not good for oil." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was going}} to write about it for that paper in Paris." [...] The girl had the effect of {{gathering}} her courage up for a bold plunge. She looked steadily at her father, and added: [...] "He said he came back because he couldn't help it. He--wished to speak with me, He said he knew he had no right to suppose I cared <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> had happened with him and Mr. Stoller. He wanted to come back and tell me--that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} didn't want to hear. I believe you really don't want to. What {{is all this}} to you? I believe that you don't care <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> I feel, about what I do and how I end. I verily believe that you don't care how you end yourself. I believe you never cared for your own or anybody's feelings. I don't think it is because you are hard, I think it is because you don't know, and don't want to know, and are angry with life." ...|$|E
5000|$|Little {{information}} about the Ring has been revealed so far. In [...] "Chuck Versus the Ring," [...] Bryce Larkin reveals that FULCRUM was {{only one part of}} the Ring, however he died from a fatal gunshot wound before he could say <b>anything</b> further <b>about</b> <b>what</b> he knew. Unlike FULCRUM, which is primarily made up of rogue elements of the CIA, the Ring has operatives outside the intelligence community.|$|R
6000|$|... "We don't know <b>anything</b> yet <b>about</b> <b>what</b> is to be," [...] said Caroline, quickly; and at {{that moment}} Elliot, coming in, offered to ride with her to High Down, whereupon she hastened to get ready. Such an obliging offer from her brother was {{certainly}} too uncommon a thing to be neglected, in spite of the unwonted graciousness and amiability which Elliot had for the last few weeks assumed towards her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, by-the-way, you needn't {{mind about}} those gores. I don't really know <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> cattle, except <b>what</b> I {{was able to}} pick up in a week's {{apprenticeship}} over in Jersey just before we sailed. My cattle-culture and cattle-enthusiasm have served their turn--I shan't need them any more.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was a {{long time}} before she spoke again, and then she didn't say <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> we had been talking of, but began to ask whether I thought we were sure to find the {{soldiers}} still at the fort. In course I couldn't say for sartin, but, to cheer her up, I talked hopeful about it, though I thought it was likely enough they had fallen back on the settlements. I did some long spells of running now, and got more hopeful, for the Injins didn't gain anything to speak of.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I ain't insinuating <b>{{anything}}</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> {{you been}} doing. You been your own boss, {{and of course}} I had to take anything off anybody as long as I was broke. But lemme tell you, from now on, no pasty-faced female is going to rub it in any more. You're going to try {{some of your own}} medicine. You're going to give up your rotten stenographer's job, and you're going to stay home where I put you, and when I invite you to come on a spree you're going to be glad--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Couldn't repent beforehand!" [...] {{retorted}} Deacon Latham. [...] "And I tell you, Maria, I {{never saw}} a much finer man than Captain Jenness; and the cabin's everything I said it was, and more. Lyddy reg'larly went off over it; 'n' I guess, as Mr. Goodlow says, she'll influence 'em for good. Don't you fret about her clothes any. You fitted her out in apple-pie order, and she'll soon be there. 'T ain't but a little ways to Try-East, any way, {{to what it is}} some of them India voyages, Captain Jenness said. He had his own daughters out the last voyage; 'n' I guess he can tell Lyddy when it's weather to wear her silk. I d'know as I'd better said <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> I was thinkin'. I don't want to be noways rash, and yet I thought I couldn't be too partic'lar." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she answered, most {{unexpectedly}} to me, [...] "I {{will try}} to see her. But if I do see her, and she refuses to tell me <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> your daughter, <b>what</b> will you do? Of course, I shall {{have to tell her}} I come from you, and for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You haven't told me <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> your interview; <b>what</b> you did {{and what}} your good friend Stacy said," [...] said Mrs. Barker, {{dropping}} languidly into a chair. [...] "And really {{if you are}} simply running away again after that child, I {{might just as well}} have asked Captain Heath to stay longer." ...|$|R
500|$|The score {{received}} critical acclaim, with Entertainment Weekly {{calling it}} [...] "a cast album that gleefully sends {{up all the}} Hollywood musical conventions we're being deprived of." [...] The soundtrack was released June 15, 1999 by Atlantic Records. [...] "Blame Canada" [...] was frequently highlighted {{as one of the}} best from the soundtrack and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. [...] "I was like, 'We're going to get nominated for an Academy Award for this.' I really was," [...] Parker said. [...] "I even told him [...]" [...] The song takes place in the film when the United States blames Canada for corrupting its youth. [...] "We're making fun of people who pick ridiculous targets to blame <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>what's</b> going on in their lives, so Canada was just the perfect, ridiculous, innocuous choice for a target," [...] said Shaiman. In 2011, Time called the music of the film the [...] "finest, sassiest full-movie musical score since the disbanding of the Freed unit at MGM." ...|$|R
