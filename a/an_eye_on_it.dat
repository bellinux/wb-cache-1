"No, you don't," [...] said Benham presently, {{and again}} their career became erratic {{for a time}} as after a slight {{struggle}} he replaced the apron over the knees of the deposed driver.

But in my case, on the other hand, I know it's somewhere in the baggage car, so I don't have to worry." ...|$|E
60|$|The Avonlea {{graveyard}} was as yet the grass-grown solitude it {{had always}} been. To be sure, the Improvers had <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> and Priscilla Grant had read a paper on cemeteries before the last meeting of the Society. At some future time the Improvers meant to have the lichened, wayward old board fence replaced by a neat wire railing, the grass mown and the leaning monuments straightened up.|$|E
60|$|If Mr Pickering had had {{his boyhood}} at the proper time and {{finished}} with it, he would no doubt have acted otherwise than he did. He would have contented himself with conducting a war of defence. He would have notified the police, and considered that all that remained for him personally {{to do was to}} stay in his room at night with his revolver. But boys will be boys. The only course that seemed to him in any way satisfactory in this his hour of rejuvenation was to visit the bee farm, the hotbed of crime, and keep <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> He wanted to go there and prowl.|$|E
60|$|An {{hour later}} Sam was sleeping, while Dick sat on some brushwood, tending {{the fire and}} keeping <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> Tom. <b>It</b> was very quiet, and the snow was coming down as thickly as ever. Dick had much to occupy his mind--the perils of the present situation, his father's {{business}} affairs, and Dora.|$|R

60|$|Whitney frowned as {{he looked}} about. He could see nothing except the black line of the bank {{a few yards away}} and the beam from the {{lighthouse}} on Southerness, though this had grown less distinct. There was no fog, but the air was filled with an obscuring moisture that wet his face and gathered upon the dinghy. Since the Rowan's canvas had been lowered she would be hard to see, and she lay at some distance from the water. He could not remember how long it was since he had seen the light, but it must have been some time, and he blamed himself for not keeping <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|Peter tiptoed away very softly. All {{the time}} the Imp of Mischief was {{whispering}} to him {{that this was a}} splendid chance to play a joke on Jimmy. You know it is very easy to play a joke on any one who is asleep. Peter doesn't often have a chance to play a joke on Jimmy Skunk. It isn't a very safe thing to do, not if Jimmy is awake. No one knows that better than Peter. He sat down some distance from the barrel but where he could keep <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> Then he went into a brown study, which is one way of saying that he thought very hard. He wanted to play a joke on Jimmy, but like most jokers he didn't want the joke to come back on himself. In fact, he felt {{that it would be a}} great deal better for him if Jimmy shouldn't know that he had anything to do with the joke.|$|E
6000|$|The Tawny Owl {{lay on the}} {{far side}} of the island. There were ladies in it; and Gilray's misery was meant to date from the moment when he asked one of them a {{question}}, and she said [...] "No." [...] Gilray was strangely unlucky during the whole of his time on board. His evil genius was there, though there was very little room for him, and played sad pranks. Up to the time of his asking the question referred to, Gilray meant to create a pleasant impression by being jolly, and he only succeeded in being as depressing as Jaques. Afterward he was to be unutterably miserable; and it was all he could do to keep himself at times from whirling about in waltz tune. But then the nearest boat had a piano on board, and some one was constantly playing dance music. Gilray had an idea that it would have been the proper thing to leave Molesey when she said [...] "No;" [...] and he would have done so had not the barbel-fishing been so good. The barbel-fishing was altogether unfortunate--at least Gilray's passion for it was. I have thought--and so sometimes has Gilray--that if it had not been for a barbel she might not have said [...] "No." [...] He was fishing from the house-boat when he asked the question. You know how you fish from a house-boat. The line is flung into the water and the rod laid down on deck. You keep <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> Barbel-fishing, in fact, reminds one of the independent sort of man who is quite willing to play host to you, but wishes you clearly to understand at the same time that he can do without you. [...] "Glad to see you with us if you have nothing better to do; but please yourself," [...] is what he says to his friends. This is also the form of invitation to barbel. Now it happened that she and Gilray were left alone in the house-boat. It was evening; some Chinese lanterns had been lighted, and Gilray, though you would not think it to look at him, is romantic. He cast his line, and, turning to his companion, asked her the question. From what he has told me he asked it very properly, and all seemed to be going well. She turned away her head (which is said not to be a bad sign) and had begun to reply, when a woful thing happened. The line stiffened, and there was a whirl of the reel. Who can withstand that music? You can ask a question at any time, but, even at Molesey, barbel are only to be got now and then. Gilray rushed to his rod and began playing the fish. He called to his companion to get the landing-net. She did so; and after playing his barbel for ten minutes Gilray landed it. Then he turned to her again, and she said, [...] "No." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have come}} to the {{conclusion}} that for the proper carrying out of what we will call our Great Experiment we must have absolute and complete isolation. Isolation not merely for a day or two, but for as long as we may require. Here such a thing would be impossible; the needs and habits of a great city with its ingrained possibilities of interruption, would, or might, quite upset us. Telegrams, registered letters, or express messengers would alone be sufficient; but the great army of those who want to get something would make disaster certain. In addition, the occurrences of the last week have drawn police attention to this house. Even if special instructions to keep <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> have not been issued from Scotland Yard or the District Station, you may be sure that the individual policeman on his rounds will keep it well under observation. Besides, the servants who have discharged themselves will before long begin to talk. They must; for they have, for the sake of their own characters, to give some reason for the termination of a service which has I should say a position in the neighbourhood. The servants of the neighbours will begin to talk, and, perhaps the neighbours themselves. Then the active and intelligent Press will, with its usual zeal for the enlightenment of the public and its eye to increase of circulation, get hold of the matter. When the reporter is after us we shall not have much chance of privacy. Even if we were to bar ourselves in, we should not be free from interruption, possibly from intrusion. Either would ruin our plans, and so we must take measures to effect a retreat, carrying all our impedimenta with us. For this I am prepared. For a long time past I have foreseen such a possibility, and have made preparation for it. Of course, I had no foreknowledge of what has happened; but I knew something would, or might, happen. For more than two years past my house in Cornwall has been made ready to receive all the curios which are preserved here. When Corbeck went off on his search for the lamps I had the old house at Kyllion made ready; it is fitted with electric light all over, and all the appliances for manufacture of the light are complete. I had perhaps better tell you, for none of you, not even Margaret, knows anything of it, that the house is absolutely shut out from public access or even from view. It stands on a little rocky promontory behind a steep hill, and except from the sea cannot be seen. Of old it was fenced in by a high stone wall, for the house which it succeeded was built by an ancestor of mine in the days when a great house far away from a centre had to be prepared to defend itself. Here, then, is a place so well adapted to our needs that it might have been prepared on purpose. I shall explain it to you when we are all there. This will not be long, for already our movement is in train. I have sent word to Marvin to have all preparation for our transport ready. He is to have a special train, which is to run at night so as to avoid notice. Also a number of carts and stone-wagons, with sufficient men and appliances to take all our packing-cases to Paddington. We shall be away before the Argus-eyed Pressman is on the watch. We shall today begin our packing up; and I dare say that by tomorrow night we shall be ready. In the outhouses I have all the packing-cases which were used for bringing the things from Egypt, and I am satisfied that as they were sufficient for the journey across the desert and down the Nile to Alexandria and thence on to London, they will serve without fail between here and Kyllion. We four men, with Margaret to hand us such things as we may require, will be able to get the things packed safely; and the carrier's men will take them to the trucks.|$|E

50|$|It {{refers to}} the mustang horse, a feral animal and {{therefore}} not a thoroughbred. A mustang, after being captured, can be tamed and saddle broken but it always {{has a bit of}} wild streak, and can periodically revert to its old ways unexpectedly and therefore the owner needs to keep <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> at all times.

50|$|The Pierson House, {{also known}} as the Crane House is at 420 Riverside Drive. It {{is one of the best}} known houses in Cranford. Here the major clue is {{probably}} the house’s proximity (like the Klein House to the Old York Road) to a major artery of colonial travel. In this case, the artery is Crane’s Ford, a shallow and thus important stretch of the Rahway River. It was easily traversable on horseback during colonial days, and the Pierson House, built circa 1740, was probably put there to keep <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

After a short while, Phil became the general manager of the Cunningham Car Company, who built the first post-war American cars to race at Le Mans. The organisers of Le Mans, Automobile Club de l'Ouest rejected the Fordillac, so Cunningham took two Cadillacs to the Circuit de la Sarthe in 1950. Walters paired with Cunningham and finished 11th in a special-bodied roadster, dubbed ‘Le Monstre’, despite Cunningham getting stuck off-course in some sand for half an hour.|$|R
