In February 1896 they hit {{on the idea of}} holding a race from Paris to their track. This presented two problems. The first was that the biggest races started or ended in Paris and that Roubaix might be too provincial a destination. The second was that they could organize the start or finish but not both.|$|E

[...] Lacewood Studio in Ottawa, Canada, {{was in charge of}} animating the pilot episode. [...] World Sports and Entertainment of Los Angeles was involved as well; Norman Singer organised the production and Gerald Tripp helped Lat to write the script. [...] Bobdog Production was responsible for animating another five episodes. [...] However, Krishman and Lat were disappointed with the results, which had taken two years of work to produce. [...] They thought the pilot was [...] "slow-moving". [...] Lat believed Lacewood had accommodated him too often during the production, accepting his input without question. [...] They failed to inform him that although a slow pace worked for static cartoon drawings, a good animation was often [...] "lively, fast-moving, full of action and fantasy".|$|E

500|$|Both {{teams had}} chances during the match with Philadelphia making an {{especially}} intense push {{in the final}} 15 minutes. While both defenses struggled throughout, Frei and MacMath combined {{for a total of}} seven saves (four and three, respectively). Schmid told the press after the final: [...] "From a fans' standpoint, it was probably a very, very entertaining game." [...] A writer for Sports Illustrated quipped that [...] "Schmid's decision not to start Obafemi Martins and Pappa was confusing — <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> like a stroke of genius", as both were integral to the Sounders offense in the later stages of the game. Schmid told reporters during a post-match interview that Martins did not start due to a muscle strain. The coach also praised the ability of Martins and Dempsey to complete key passes with each other. The Sounders received a $250,000 cash prize for winning the tournament. It was Dempsey's first club trophy of his long career, and he beat Martins in voting to be named the Player of the Round. Yedlin and Frei also received votes. Seattle {{went on to win the}} MLS Supporters' Shield for having the best record in the league before being eliminated from the playoffs. The Open Cup win granted the team a spot in the 2015–16 CONCACAF Champions League.|$|E
500|$|At {{some point}} in the 1896 season, Hogan {{apparently}} secured his release from the Browns. Once again, however, his physical speed offered no guarantee of consistency on the playing field. [...] On July 21, 1896, the St. Paul (Minneapolis) Globe reported that Hogan had performed poorly in a contest between the Hoosiers and the local ball club. [...] "Marty Hogan...made a bad fumble, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> up at the sky to see if it had moved while he was locating the ball", the paper reported. [...] "It was a good bluff, but the crowd discovered Marty's weakness {{before the end of the}} game". [...] In January 1897, the Vindicator reported that the Hoosiers had sold Hogan to a club in Grand Rapids, Michigan. [...] The article called Hogan [...] "one of the fastest outfielders and baserunners in the Western League" [...] and predicted he would [...] "greatly strengthen the Grand Rapids outfield". [...] The following month, however, the paper described the previous report as a [...] "mistake", indicating instead that Hogan had signed a contract with baseball executive John T. Brush to play with the Hoosiers for another year. [...] The paper also reported that the contract granted Hogan [...] "the largest salary he has ever drawn". [...] Despite this lucrative contract, Hogan established and maintained his own advertising distribution agency in Indianapolis. [...] "He goes about the streets dressed much like an English costermonger", Sporting Life reported in January 1897. [...] "Marty can be seen with a little red wagon full of signs and advertising matter chasing up and down streets nailing the signs to buildings and convenient places and distributing advertising literature in the reel-dance portion of Indianapolis". [...] Less than four months later, in May 1897, he was released by the Indianapolis ball club. In June 1897, the Kansas City Journal indicated Hogan had moved on to the Dayton (Ohio) Old Soldiers, a team affiliated with the Class B Interstate League, where he was [...] "playing a sensational center field". In October of the same year, Sporting Life speculated Hogan would remain with Dayton during the upcoming 1898 season. [...] "Marty Hogan's contract with Dayton is such that he cannot be reserved, as are the rest of the players", the article stated. [...] "Unless Marty has a better offer to play with some other team it is safe to say that he will be with Dayton next year". [...] Further research is required to determine how long Hogan continued to play as an outfielder in the minor leagues. [...] (His obituary indicated that he also worked as a major league trainer.) [...] During his playing career, he apparently received at least one serious injury. [...] In February 1903, Sporting Life reported that the former baseball player's friends were [...] "anxious to get him appointed on the staff of American League umpires". [...] The article added, [...] "Hogan has suffered from operations to remove portions of his breast bone, which was injured in a collision during a baseball game".|$|E
2500|$|Legend {{states that}} Hanina was greatly grieved at not being able, with other pious people, to present {{something}} to the Temple. In his despondency {{he walked out of}} town, and, seeing a huge rock, he vowed to carry it to Jerusalem as a gift to the Holy City. He smoothed and polished it, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> around for help to transport it. Five laborers appeared, and offered to carry the rock to its destined place for one hundred gold pieces. Hanina, who did not possess half that amount, turned away in despair. Soon, however, other laborers appeared and demanded only five [...] "sela'im," [...] but they stipulated that Hanina himself should aid in the transportation. The agreement concluded, they all seized the rock, and in an instant stood before Jerusalem. When Hanina turned to pay the laborers they were nowhere to be found. He repaired to the Sanhedrin to inquire what disposition he should make of the uncollected wages. The Sanhedrin heard his tale and concluded that the laborers were ministering angels, not human laborers, and that Hanina was therefore at liberty to apply the money to his own use. He, however, presented it to the Temple (Cant. R. i. 1; Eccl. R. i.).|$|E

40|$|Geometric {{problems}} are usually formulated {{by means of}} (exterior) differential systems. In this theory, one enriches the system by adding algebraic and differential constraints, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> for regular solutions. Here we adopt a dual approach, which consists to enrich a plane field, as this is often practised in control theory, by adding brackets of the vector fields tangent to it, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>look</b> for singular solutions of the obtained distribution. We apply this to the isometry problem of rigid geometric structures. Comment: 14 pages, LaTe...|$|R
