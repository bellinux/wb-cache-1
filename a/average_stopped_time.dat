40|$|Due to the {{widespread}} deployment of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs) for critical road or urban applications, {{one of the}} major challenges to be solved is the provision of integrity to terrestrial environments, so that GNSS may be safety used in these applications. To do so, the integrity of the received GNSS signal must be analyzed in order to detect some local effect disturbing the received signal. This is desirable because the presence of some local effect may cause large position errors, and hence compromise the signal integrity. Moreover, the detection of such disturbing effects must be done before some pre-established delay. This kind of detection lies within the field of transient change detection. In this work, a finite moving <b>average</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>time</b> is proposed in order to approach the signal integrity problem with a transient change detection framework.

40|$|Sequential {{estimation}} of a vector of linear regression coefficients is considered under both centralized and decentralized setups. In sequential estimation, {{the number of}} observations used for estimation {{is determined by the}} observed samples, hence is random, as opposed to fixed-sample-size estimation. Specifically, after receiving a new sample, if a target accuracy level is reached, we stop and estimate using the samples collected so far; otherwise we continue to receive another sample. It is known that finding an optimum sequential estimator, which minimizes the average sample number for a given target accuracy level, is an intractable problem with a general stopping rule that depends on the complete observation history. By properly restricting the search space to stopping rules that depend on a specific subset of the complete observation history, we derive the optimum sequential estimator in the centralized case via optimal stopping theory. However, finding the optimum stopping rule in this case requires numerical computations that quadratically scales with the number of parameters to be estimated. For the decentralized setup with stringent energy constraints, under an alternative problem formulation that is conditional on the observed regressors, we first derive a simple optimum scheme whose computational complexity is constant with respect to the number of parameters. Then, following this simple optimum scheme we propose a decentralized sequential estimator whose computational complexity and energy consumption scales linearly with the number of parameters. Specifically, in the proposed decentralized scheme a close-to-optimum <b>average</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>time</b> performance is achieved by infrequently transmitting a single pulse with very short duration...|$|R

Many major train accidents occurred due by failure of track, equipment, human factors, signal, asld miscellaneous. In this study, an automatic train control system using predictive fizzy controller that uses rules based on a skilled hostker experience has been proposed and simulated using Matlab Sirnulink software. The Matlab S i m W model is designed based on 16. 65 kilometres railroad layout fiom Station A to Station B within 1030 seconds travel time. The train model used for the Simulink simulation is 22 tonnes two-car train and its stability control was performed using a tuning PID control. In the simulations, two types of input variable are used which are train weight and weather. The main objective of this automatic train operation is to prevent collision and ensuring reliable performance. The fuzzy controller selects the most likely control output and also direct evaluation of the control objective. The proposed fuzzy controller has been applied for automatic train operation where the control system was developed based on the evaluation of safety, riding comfort, accuracy stop gap and running time.
