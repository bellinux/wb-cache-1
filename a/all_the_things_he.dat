5|$|Upon Irataba's {{return from}} Washington D.C., {{he met with}} the Mohave while dressed in his major general's uniform, with medals. He wore a European-style hat and carried a long Japanese sword, and he told the Mohave about <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> had seen. He tried to {{convince}} them that peace with the United States was in their best interests, and that war against them was futile, stressing their dominant military capabilities.

5|$|Homer {{decides to}} take his family to the new sushi bar, The Happy Sumo. After {{sampling}} most of {{the items on the}} menu, he tries sushi made from fugu. The chef in charge is busy making love with Edna, so his apprentice has to slice the fish, of which certain parts are toxic. He tries to do it carefully, but Homer becomes impatient, only to have it served and become unsure if the poisonous portions have been removed. Homer considers it a treat, but the chef soon returns and believes that the fish has not been prepared correctly and tells Homer that he may have been poisoned. Homer and Marge go to the hospital, where Dr. Hibbert informs Homer that based on a chat he had with the sushi chef, Homer is found out that he has increased likeliness of death and has 22 hours left to live. At night with Marge by his side, he decides not to tell his children about the bad news and makes a list of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> wants to do before death.|$|E
25|$|In the Millennium special, S.Baldrick {{constructs}} a fake {{time machine}} from Leonardo da Vinci's sketches, despite {{his inability to}} read (combating this with his experience of constructing Airfix models). Baldrick's intelligence has risen {{to the level of}} the second Baldrick again and accidentally makes a real time machine. After a time-travel adventure, Lord Blackadder find England an extension of France, William Shakespeare having designed the ballpoint pen and no knowledge of Robin Hood whatsoever. Edmund takes <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> gained on his journey (besides Elizabeth I's crown) and after another adventure, gets the idea to alter the timeline to become King. Predictably, Baldrick becomes his Prime Minister, finally becoming what he desired (as did Edmund) and is the second Baldrick to rise to upper class (although after Blackadder's alterations there may be more).|$|E

500|$|... "One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish" [...] is the {{eleventh}} episode of The Simpsons second season. It originally aired on Fox {{network in the}} United States on January 24, 1991. In the episode, Homer consumes a poisonous fugu fish at a sushi restaurant, and is told that he has only 22hours left to live. He accepts his fate and makes a list of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> wants to do before he dies.|$|E
500|$|... "I Remember Larry" [...] is a style {{parody of}} Hilly Michaels, and {{it tells the}} tale of a {{neighborhood}} bully who, after myriad pranks, is brutally murdered by the narrator. At the 3:10 mark, the song contains a backmasked message, which when reversed reads, [...] "Wow, you must have an awful lot of free time on your hands". [...] "The Night Santa Went Crazy" [...] tells the story of Santa snapping, embarking on a killing spree, and eventually being arrested. Originally, the song had a different third verse, differing in the fact that, {{at the end of the}} song, Santa is killed by the SWAT team. The [...] "Extra Gory" [...] version was eventually released on the single for [...] "Amish Paradise". Another version was written for the Touring with Scissors tour in 1999, combining elements of the album version and the [...] "Extra Gory" [...] version. [...] "Since You've Been Gone" [...] is a generic doo-wop a cappella track that details a lover's torment after the object of his affections breaks up with him. Yankovic performed most of the vocals himself, and to make sure that he stayed on key, a scratch guitar track was recorded; when the song was mixed, the guitar track was removed. Bassist Steve Jay provides the low voices in the song. Finally, [...] "I'm So Sick of You," [...] a style parody of Elvis Costello in which the singer tells his girlfriend <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> hates about her.|$|E

500|$|Steve Giergerich of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch {{felt that}} Sarah and Little Bee are both [...] "so richly drawn that the {{supporting}} characters suffer by comparison." [...] These supporting characters are Andrew, Sarah's husband, Lawrence, her lover, Clarissa her colleague and Charlie, her four-year-old son, who {{for much of}} the novel answers only to [...] "Batman" [...] and dresses only in his Batman costume. Sarah Liss of CBC News deemed Andrew and Lawrence the two least-likeable characters in the novel, describing Andrew as [...] "an ordinary guy with self-righteous beliefs who comes up slightly short when he's tested by real life" [...] and Lawrence as a [...] "cowardly yes-man". Cleave agreed that for Lawrence, [...] "career and propriety are more important than basic morality. He's gone so far down that road that he can't come back, and he's made more villainous for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> could do but doesn't." [...] Charlie is based on Cleave's oldest son, who similarly spent six months aged four answering only to [...] "Batman". He forms the emotional centre of the novel, holding the adult characters together, and is a study in the early formation of identity. Cleave explained: [...] "Little Bee is a novel about where our individuality lies – which layers of identity are us, and which are mere camouflage. So it's a deliberate choice to use the metaphor of a child who is engaging in his first experiments with identity – in Charlie's case by taking on the persona of a superhero." ...|$|E
500|$|... "When I Was Your Man" [...] {{was written}} by Andrew Wyatt, Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine, while {{production}} was handled by the latter three production-team The Smeezingtons. Having chord progressions Am-C-Dm-G-G7-C (verse) and F-G-C (chorus), the song is written in the key of C Major, with Mars' vocals range from the low note of G3 to the high note of C5. The pop piano ballad finds Mars singing about a pre-fame heartbreak as he regrets letting his woman get away. It starts with a rolling piano riff; unto a nearly scat [...] "vocal cadence": [...] "Same bed but it feels {{just a little bit}} bigger now / Our song on the radio but it don’t sound the same", as he laments the [...] "single state" [...] he created for himself. Next, he sings of his failings; to do right by his woman, [...] "I shoulda bought you flowers / And held your hand / Shoulda gave you all my hours / When I had the chance". Its title phrase re-emerges in the final chorus, juxtaposed by Bruno from <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> [...] "shoulda" [...] done, into things he hopes his ex’s new man will do; concluding: [...] "Do all of the things I should have done / When I was your man". In an interview to Rolling Stone, Mars revealed, while reluctant, that he wrote the song for his girlfriend, model Jessica Caban, when he was worried about losing her. In contrast with the song, Mars and Caban stayed together; remaining a couple as of 2014. Mars also said, in the interview, that he finds it difficult to perform the song; saying: [...] "You're bringing up all these old emotions again," [...] and that: [...] "It's just like bleeding!" ...|$|E
500|$|In Things Fall Apart, Okonkwo's furious manhood overpowers {{everything}} [...] "feminine" [...] in his life, {{including his}} own conscience. For example, when he feels bad after being forced to kill his adopted son, he asks himself: [...] "When did you become a shivering old woman?" [...] It is also argued that one’s chi, or personal god, is the ‘mother within’. This understanding further demonstrates how Okonkwo’s hypermasculinity corrupts his conscience, as his contempt for his own mother and other women prevents him from being in harmony with his chi. He views all things feminine as distasteful, {{in part because they}} remind him of his father's laziness and cowardice. His father was considered an agbala—a word that refers to a man without title, but is also synonymous with ‘woman’. Thus, Okonkwo not only regrets his father’s lack of success, but attributes it to a lack of masculinity. Okonkwo’s feminization of all things lacking success or power is a common theme throughout the novel. His obsession with maleness is fuelled by an intense fear of femaleness, which he expresses through physical and verbal abuse of his wives, his violence towards his community, his constant worry that his son Nwoye is not manly enough, and his wish that his daughter Ezinma had been born a boy. The women in the novel, meanwhile, are obedient, quiet, and absent from positions of authority– despite the fact that Igbo women were traditionally involved in village leadership. Nevertheless, the need for feminine balance is highlighted by Ani, the earth goddess, and the extended discussion of [...] "Nneka" [...] ("Mother is supreme") in chapter fourteen. Ekwefi’s perseverance and love for Ezinma, despite her many miscarriages, is seen as a tribute to Igbo womanhood, which is typically defined by motherhood. Okonkwo's defeat is seen by some as a vindication of the need for a balancing feminine ethos. Some have also argued that all of Okonkwo’s failures are tied to his contempt and fear of women and his inability to form quality personal relationships with the women in his life—his wives, his children, and his own mother. Achebe has expressed frustration at frequently being misunderstood on this point, saying that [...] "I want to sort of scream that Things Fall Apart {{is on the side of}} women... And that Okonkwo is paying the penalty for his treatment of women; that all his problems, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> did wrong, can be seen as offenses against the feminine." [...] Indeed, it is argued that Okonkwo’s violent and vehement anti-women position is the exception, not the norm, within his community of Umuofia and the wider Igbo society. Still, post-colonial African writing is intensely male-centred, a phenomenon that is not alleviated by the frequent trope of the African woman as the [...] "embodiment of the male writer’s vision for the new Africa". It is argued that even when women and their lives are more centrally depicted in literature, the male writer continues to be the visionary while the woman is the [...] "sign" [...] of changes to come.|$|E

2500|$|As Raimi and his {{producing}} partner Robert Tapert progressed {{through various}} drafts, {{they realized that}} there was a potential franchise on their hands. Universal brought in screenwriting brothers Daniel and Joshua Goldin to work on the script. According to Daniel, they were presented with various drafts and [...] "lots of little story documents. There was just material everywhere; drafts seemed to go in many directions." [...] Goldin said that they [...] "spent {{a lot of time talking}} and pulling together a way of making the story work. I think that mostly we talked in terms of the nuts and bolts of the story." [...] The Goldins added new lines of dialogue, new characters and bits of action. The studio still wasn't satisfied so the Raimi brothers wrote drafts six through twelve before they had a shooting script. For Raimi, he wanted to emphasize Peyton/Darkman's arc over the course of the film. He said, [...] "I decided to explore a man's soul. In the beginning, a sympathetic, sincere man. In the middle, a vengeful man committing heinous acts against his enemies.
