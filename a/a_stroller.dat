The ship's musicians travelled in second class accommodations; they were not counted {{as members of the}} crew but were employed by an agency under contract to the White Star Line. The average ticket price for an adult second class passenger was £13, the equivalent of £ today. and for many of these passengers, their travel experience on the Titanic was akin to travelling first class on smaller liners. Second class passengers had their own library and the men had access to a private smoking room. Second class children could read the children's books provided in the library or play deck quoits and shuffleboard on the second class promenade. Twelve-year-old Ruth Becker passed the time by pushing her two-year-old brother Richard around the enclosed promenade in <b>a</b> <b>stroller</b> provided by the White Star Line.|$|E

500|$|On July 11, 2015, Marvin Carr, {{better known}} by his stage name, Capo, a {{longtime}} member of Keef's Glo Gang label, {{was shot and}} killed in a drive-by shooting in Chicago. Upon killing Capo, the drivers of the vehicle reportedly struck <b>a</b> <b>stroller</b> with 13-month-old Dillan Harris in it, killing the baby instantly. Keef later announced via Twitter that he would be holding a free benefit concert to tribute Capo, as well as encourage concertgoers to donate to Harris' family. Additionally, Keef announced the formation of the Stop the Violence Now Foundation, in an attempt to decrease crime in Chicago. Due to outstanding warrants in Illinois, Keef was scheduled to attend the concert via hologram from a sound stage in Beverly Hills. The concert, organized by HologramUSA and FilmOn Music originally intended to be held in Chicago's Redmoon Theater, faced a series of delays after Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel's office claimed Keef was [...] "an unacceptable role model" [...] and that his music promoted violence. Keef's representatives then worked out an arrangement with promoters of the Craze Fest event, located in Hammond, Indiana, in an attempt to hold the concert there. Keef's hologram was able to plea for peace in Chicago, stating, [...] "Stop the violence, stop nonsense, stop the killing. Let the kids grow up," [...] before performing [...] "I Don't Like". Fearing that the concert was a threat to public safety, Hammond mayor Thomas McDermott, Jr. successfully organized for the city's police to shut down the generators powering Keef's hologram. McDermott was quoted saying, [...] "I know nothing about Chief Keef. All I’d heard was {{he has a lot of}} songs about gangs and shooting people — a history that’s anti-cop, pro-gang and pro-drug use. He’s been basically outlawed in Chicago, and we’re not going to let you circumvent Mayor Emanuel by going next door." [...] Chicago Tribune columnist Eric Zorn criticized Emmanuel and Hammond for their decisions, claiming they infringed upon Keef's First Amendment rights.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the daytime}} (before six o'clock), the semi-formal code {{requires}} for men a black tail-less coat with formal (vertical black & grey stripes, or checked) trousers, {{with a black}} waistcoat. [...] This combination is a less formal version of morning dress, which features a longer, cutaway morning coat. [...] This semi-formal ensemble is {{sometimes referred to as}} a [...] "stroller" [...] in North America, or a Marlborough suit in the UK. Because black was then reserved for formalwear, it was unknown as a color for lounge suits, so the term was unambiguous. In the UK this mode of dress is now extremely unusual, though some Masonic Lodges which meet during the day rather than (as is more common) in the evening do continue to specify it as their dress code. It also still is worn within the legal profession, especially by barristers. Indeed, the striped trousers are in some circles referred to as [...] "barrister trousers". [...] In German, <b>a</b> <b>stroller</b> is called a Stresemann, after the German foreign secretary Gustav Stresemann. Stresemann, like other German politicians of his age, wore morning dress or a frock coat in the Reichstag or when making public appearances. However, Stresemann found the long coat impractical for daily work in the Chancellery. To avoid having to change completely, he began to wear the prototype of this jacket at his office, while switching to a morning coat when engaged on more formal business. The style quickly caught on as a more practical variation on morning dress. In Japan, it is known as a [...] "director's suit", from the term inside director.|$|E

6000|$|Our set of strollers, {{wandering}} up and down, Hearing {{the house}} was empty, came to town; And, with a license from our good lord mayor, Went to one Griffith, formerly a player: Him we persuaded, with a moderate bribe, To speak to Elrington[1] and all the tribe, To let our company supply their places, And hire us out their scenes, and clothes, and faces. Is not the truth the truth? Look full on me; I am not Elrington, nor Griffith he. When we perform, look sharp among our crew, There's not a creature here you ever knew. The former folks were servants to the king; We, humble strollers, always on the wing. Now, for my part, I think, upon the whole, Rather than starve, a better man would stroll. [...] Stay! let me see--Three hundred pounds a-year, For leave to act in town!--'Tis plaguy dear. Now, here's a warrant; gallants, please to mark, For three thirteens, and sixpence to the clerk. Three hundred pounds! Were I the price to fix, The public should bestow the actors six; A score of guineas given underhand, For a good word or so, we understand. To help an honest lad that's out of place, May cost a crown or so; a common case: And, in a crew, 'tis no injustice thought To ship a rogue, and pay him not a groat. But, in the chronicles of former ages, Who ever heard of servants paying wages? [...] I pity Elrington with all my heart; Would he were here this night to act my part! I told him {{what it was to}} be a stroller; How free we acted, and had no comptroller: In every town we wait on Mr. Mayor, First get a license, then produce our ware; We sound a trumpet, or we beat a drum: Huzza! (the schoolboys roar) the players are come; And then we cry, to spur the bumpkins on, Gallants, by Tuesday next we must be gone. I told him in the smoothest way I could, All this, and more, yet it would do no good. But Elrington, tears falling from his cheeks, He that has shone with Betterton and Wilks,[2] To whom our country has been always dear, Who chose to leave his dearest pledges here, Owns all your favours, here intends to stay, And, as <b>a</b> <b>stroller,</b> act in every play: And the whole crew this resolution takes, To live and die all strollers, for your sakes; Not frighted with an ignominious name, For your displeasure is their only shame. [...] A pox on Elrington's majestic tone! Now to a word of business in our own. [...] Gallants, next Thursday night will be our last: Then without fail we pack up for Belfast. Lose not your time, nor our diversion miss, The next we act shall be as good as this.|$|E
