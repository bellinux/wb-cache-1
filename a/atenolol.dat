25|$|Some alleles {{that vary}} in {{frequency}} between specific populations {{have been shown}} to be associated with differential responses to specific drugs. The beta blocker <b>atenolol</b> is an anti-hypertensive medication that is shown to more significantly lower the blood pressure of Caucasian patients than African American patients in the United States. This observation suggests that Caucasian and African American populations have different alleles governing oleic acid biochemistry, which react differentially with <b>atenolol.</b> Similarly, hypersensitivity to the antiretroviral drug abacavir is strongly associated with a single-nucleotide polymorphism that varies in frequency between populations.|$|E
25|$|Proper CVD {{management}} necessitates a {{focus on}} MI and stroke cases due to their combined high mortality rate, keeping in mind the cost-effectiveness of any intervention, especially in developing countries with low or middle income levels. Regarding MI, strategies using aspirin, <b>atenolol,</b> streptokinase or tissue plasminogen activator have been compared for quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in regions of low and middle income. The costs for a single QALY for aspirin, <b>atenolol,</b> streptokinase, and t-PA were $25, $630–$730, and $16,000, respectively. Aspirin, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, and statins used together for secondary CVD prevention in the same regions showed single QALY costs of $300–400.|$|E
25|$|Sertraline had {{no effect}} on the actions of digoxin and <b>atenolol,</b> which are not metabolized in the liver. Case reports suggest that taking {{sertraline}} with phenytoin or zolpidem may induce sertraline metabolism and decrease its efficacy, and that taking sertraline with lamotrigine may increase the blood level of lamotrigine, possibly by inhibition of glucuronidation.|$|E
25|$|Primidone is not {{the only}} {{anticonvulsant}} used for essential tremor; the others include topiramate (Topamax) and gabapentin (Neurontin). Other pharmacological agents include alprazolam (Xanax), clonazepam (Klonopin), <b>atenolol,</b> sotalol, nadolol, clozapine, nimodipine, and botilinum toxin A. Many of these drugs were less effective (according to Table 1), but a few were not. Only propranolol has been compared to primidone in a clinical trial.|$|E
25|$|Beta2-adrenergic agonist acts on beta-2 {{receptor}} {{to drive}} potassium into the cells. Therefore, beta blockers {{can cause the}} rise in potassium levels due to blockage of beta-2 receptors. However, the rise potassium levels is not marked unless there are other co-morbidities present. Examples of drugs that can raise the serum potassium are non-selective beta-blockers such as propanolol and labetalol. Beta-1 selective blockers such as <b>atenolol</b> do not increase serum potassium levels.|$|E
25|$|The {{progress}} in β-blocker development {{led to the}} introduction of drugs with variety of properties. β-blockers were developed having a relative selectivity for cardiac β1-receptors (for example metoprolol and <b>atenolol),</b> partial adrenergic agonist activity (pindolol), concomitant α-adrenergic blocking activity (for example labetalol and carvedilol) and additional direct vasodilator activity (nebivolol). In addition, long-acting and ultra-short formulations of β-blockers were developed. In 1988, Sir James Black was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his work on drug development.|$|E
25|$|The main {{goals of}} {{treatment}} in angina pectoris are relief of symptoms, slowing {{progression of the}} disease, and reduction of future events, especially heart attacks and death. Beta blockers (e.g., carvedilol, propranolol, <b>atenolol)</b> have {{a large body of}} evidence in morbidity and mortality benefits (fewer symptoms, less disability and longer life) and short-acting nitroglycerin medications have been used since 1879 for symptomatic relief of angina. Calcium channel blockers (such as nifedipine (Adalat) and amlodipine), isosorbide mononitrate and nicorandil are vasodilators commonly used in chronic stable angina. A new therapeutic class, called If inhibitor, has recently been made available: Ivabradine provides pure heart rate reduction leading to major anti-ischemic and antianginal efficacy. ACE inhibitors are also vasodilators with both symptomatic and prognostic benefit. Statins are the most frequently used lipid/cholesterol modifiers, which probably also stabilize existing atheromatous plaque. Low-dose aspirin decreases the risk of heart attack in patients with chronic stable angina, and was part of standard treatment. However, in patients without established cardiovascular disease, the increase in hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding offsets any benefits and it is no longer advised unless the risk of myocardial infarction is very high.|$|E
2500|$|The {{withdrawal}} of Eraldin gave ICI the nudge to launch another β-blocker, <b>atenolol,</b> which {{was launched in}} 1976 under the trade name Tenormin. <b>Atenolol</b> is a selective β1-receptor antagonist and was developed {{for the purpose of}} obtaining the “ideal β-blocker”. [...] It soon became one of the best-selling heart drug. ICI’s β-blocker project was based on Ahlquist’s dual receptor theory. The drugs that were the outcome of this project, from propranolol to <b>atenolol,</b> helped to establish the receptor theory among scientist and pharmaceutical companies.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{clinical}} evidence shows calcium channel blockers and thiazide-type diuretics are preferred first-line treatments for most patients (due to both efficacy and cost), an angiotensin II receptor antagonist such as losartan is recommended as first-line treatment in patients {{under the age}} of 55 who cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor. The LIFE study demonstrated losartan was significantly superior to <b>atenolol</b> in the primary prevention of adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction or stroke), with a significant reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality for a comparable reduction in blood pressure. [...] The maximal effects on blood pressure usually occur within 3–6 weeks of starting losartan.|$|E
2500|$|Jerome [...] "Jerry" [...] Niemeyer and his wife, Jean Niemeyer, {{lived in}} Columbus Grove, Ohio, near Bluffton. Jerry {{had been driving}} buses for years for several school events and trips, {{specifically}} for Executive Coach Luxury Travel Inc, and he had transported the team on the same route a year before. Shortly before the team's 2007 trip to Florida, Jean had quit {{her job at the}} local McDonald's in Ottawa, Ohio. The Niemeyers checked into a Comfort Inn at Adairsville just after 7:30pm the evening before the crash. From all indications, Jerry had taken the rest period required by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Standards before taking over the motorcoach. Blood and urine samples from his body later showed the presence of ibuprofen, therapeutic levels of the antidepressant Sertraline and the anti-hypertensive drug <b>Atenolol,</b> and conclude that he had no alcohol in his system.|$|E
5000|$|Atenolol/chlorthalidone (brand name Tenoretic) is a {{combination}} of two drugs prescribed for hypertension: <b>atenolol</b> and chlorthalidone. [...] <b>Atenolol</b> is a cardio-selective beta-blocker 2. Chlorthalidone is a diuretic. Tenoretic is not indicated for the initial treatment of hypertension but combines two effective drugs in a convenient once-a-day dosage for individuals who have been prescribed <b>atenolol</b> and chlorthalidone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Atenolol</b> is a {{selective}} β1 receptor antagonist, a drug {{belonging to the}} group of beta blockers (sometimes written β-blockers), a class of drugs used primarily in cardiovascular diseases. Introduced in 1976, <b>atenolol</b> was developed as a replacement for propranolol in the treatment of hypertension. It works by slowing down the heart and reducing its workload. Unlike propranolol, <b>atenolol</b> does not readily pass through the blood-brain barrier, thus decreasing the incidence of central nervous system side effects.|$|E
50|$|Due to its {{hydrophilic}} (water-attracting) properties, {{the drug}} is less suitable in migraine prophylaxis compared to propranolol, because, for this indication, <b>atenolol</b> would have to reach the brain in high concentrations, {{which is not the}} case, because <b>atenolol</b> does not pass through the blood-brain barrier.|$|E
50|$|Antihypertensive {{therapy with}} <b>atenolol</b> {{provides}} weaker protective action against cardiovascular complications (e.g. myocardial infarction and stroke) {{compared to other}} antihypertensive drugs. In some cases, diuretics are superior. In addition, <b>atenolol</b> {{has been found to}} lack mortality benefits and even to increase mortality in older adults.|$|E

5000|$|Studies have {{compared}} AH-1058 to widely used and clinically available {{drugs such as}} verapamil (a Class IV antiarrhythmic drug) and <b>atenolol</b> (a Beta Blocker) to assess the efficacy of AH-1058. The effects of AH-1058 are slower to onset but longer-lasting than those of verapamil and <b>atenolol.</b> In addition, the minimal effects AH-1058 has on total peripheral vascular resistance is an important advantage over <b>atenolol</b> and verapamil, as these drugs an be taken long term for disease management. [...] Lastly AH-1058 displays a greater selectivity for cardiac tissue over verapamil and <b>atenolol</b> with {{the same level of}} potency as verapamil in vitro. AH-1058 studies have been limited to in vitro and in vivo canine and guinea-pig models, with a greater potency displayed in vitro than in vivo. Along with decreased potency in vivo, blood levels do not correlate with AH-1058 activity.|$|E

50|$|Co-tenidone (BAN) is a non- name used {{to denote}} a {{combination}} of <b>atenolol</b> and chlortalidone. Co-tenidone {{is used in the}} treatment of hypertension. The use of β-blockers in hypertension was downgraded in June 2006 in the United Kingdom to fourth-line because they perform less well than other drugs, and because <b>atenolol,</b> the most frequently used β-blocker, at usual doses carries an unacceptable risk of provoking type 2 diabetes.|$|E
50|$|It {{may be as}} {{effective}} as the beta blocker <b>atenolol</b> and comparable with amlodipine in the management of chronic stable angina.|$|E
5000|$|... 4-Hydroxymandelic acid is a {{chemical}} compound used to synthesize <b>atenolol.</b> The compound typically occurs as a monohydrate (C8H8O4 • H2O at 186.16 g/mol).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Atenolol</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used β-blockers in the United Kingdom and was once the {{first-line}} treatment for hypertension. <b>Atenolol</b> is effective at reducing blood pressure, but recent studies indicate that it does not reduce the morbidity or mortality caused by hypertension, and may even increase mortality in some subgroups. [...] This means that when people take this drug, they get better blood pressure numbers, but they still die of heart attacks and strokes, despite the lower blood pressure.|$|E
50|$|The First International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-1) was a {{placebo-controlled}} {{trial of}} the beta-blocker <b>atenolol.</b> It recruited 16,027 patients and was completed in 1985.|$|E
50|$|Bisoprolol has {{a higher}} degree of β1-selectivity {{compared}} to other β1-selective β-blockers such as <b>atenolol,</b> metoprolol, and betaxolol. However nebivolol is approximately 3.5 times more β1-selective.|$|E
50|$|In small studies, {{zofenopril}} appeared {{significantly more}} effective in reducing hypertension than two older antihypertensive drugs, <b>atenolol</b> and enalapril, and was associated with fewer adverse effects.|$|E
