If a single function were to be chosen from the early literature on botanical gardens, it would be their scientific endeavour and, flowing from this, their instructional value. In their formative years, botanical gardens were gardens for physicians and botanists, but then they progressively became more associated with ornamental horticulture and the needs of the general public. The scientific reputation of a botanical garden is now judged by the publications coming out of herbaria and similar facilities, not by its living collections. The interest in economic plants now has less relevance, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>concern</b> with plant classification systems has all but disappeared, while a fascination with the curious, beautiful and new seems unlikely to diminish.|$|E

The legislature called a special election in November to replace 33 members, mostly Minstrels, who had left for patronage jobs in the Baxter government. Baxter refused to let the Minstrels manipulate the election, declaring that free, honest elections would be held during his term. With the help of the newly re-enfranchised voters, conservative Democrats swept the election and gained a small majority in the legislature. Baxter was about to erode his Republican base out from under him.|$|E

Named after the band by an unnamed female employee at Capcom, she was designed by Akira Yasuda to contrast against the bigger characters {{in the game and}} move about randomly. According to the book All About Capcom Head to Head Fighting Games and Final Fight director Akira Nishitani, the characters were originally planned to be female, but were changed to [...] "newhalfs" [...] (a Japanese term for pre-op trans individuals) after the game's release, due to the suggestion that [...] "hitting women was considered rude" [...] in America <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>concern</b> that feminist groups would sue. However, concept artwork included in the 2005 compilation Capcom Classics Collection of the pair specifically uses the kana for 'newhalf' (ニューハーフ), contradicting the statement the change occurred post-release.|$|E

For Herschel Hardin, because of the remarkable hold of the siege mentality <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>concern</b> with survival, Canada in its essentials is [...] "a public enterprise country." [...] According to Hardin, the [...] "fundamental mode of Canadian life" [...] has always been, [...] "the un-American mechanism of redistribution as opposed to the mystic American mechanism of market rule."

Until party leader [...] Avel Safronovich Enukidnze would be placed in charge of it and he made it superior to the Soviet Academy by declaration. However, the Communist Academy would fade in the 1930s because it was seen as promoting the older Bolshevik ideals and would cease to exist ending the competition between the two. This period of completion though led to a restructuring in the Soviet Sciences Academy {{in order to better}} it so {{that it would not be}} seen as obsolete. It came close in the late 1920s to dissolving the Science Academy but would stop short of it because they decided it was important to have a singular scientific institute.

2500|$|Hasidic Judaism {{was founded}} by Yisroel ben Eliezer (1700–1760), {{also known as the}} Ba'al Shem Tov (or Besht). It {{originated}} in a time of persecution of the Jewish people, when European Jews had turned inward to Talmud study; many felt that most expressions of Jewish life had become too [...] "academic", and that they no longer had any emphasis on spirituality or joy. Its adherents favored small and informal gatherings called Shtiebel, which, in contrast to a traditional synagogue, could be used both as a place of worship and for celebrations involving dancing, eating, and socializing. Ba'al Shem Tov's disciples attracted many followers; they themselves established numerous Hasidic sects across Europe. Unlike other religions, which typically expanded through word of mouth or by use of print, Hasidism spread largely owing to Tzadiks, who used their influence to encourage others to follow the movement. Hasidism appealed to many Europeans because it was easy to learn, did not require full immediate commitment, and presented a compelling spectacle. Hasidic Judaism eventually became the way of life for many Jews in Eastern Europe. Waves of Jewish immigration in the 1880s carried it to the United States. The movement itself claims to be nothing new, but a refreshment of original Judaism. As some have put it: [...] "they merely re-emphasized that which the generations had lost". Nevertheless, early on there was a serious schism between Hasidic and non-Hasidic Jews. European Jews who rejected the Hasidic movement were dubbed by the Hasidim as Misnagdim, (lit. [...] "opponents"). Some {{of the reasons for the}} rejection of Hasidic Judaism were the exuberance of Hasidic worship, its deviation from tradition in ascribing infallibility and miracles to their leaders, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>concern</b> that it might become a messianic sect. Over time differences between the Hasidim and their opponents have slowly diminished and both groups are now considered part of Haredi Judaism.|$|E

40|$|Robust fault {{estimation}} {{plays an}} important role in real-time monitoring, diagnosis, and fault-tolerance control. Accordingly, this paper aims to develop an effective fault estimation technique to simultaneously estimate <b>the</b> system states <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerned</b> faults, while minimizing the influences from process/sensor disturbances. Specifically, an augmented system is constructed by forming an augmented state vector composed of <b>the</b> system states <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerned</b> faults. Next, an unknown input observer (UIO) is designed for the augmented system by decoupling <b>the</b> partial disturbances <b>and</b> attenuating <b>the</b> disturbances that cannot be decoupled, leading to a simultaneous estimate of <b>the</b> system states <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerned</b> faults. In order to be close to the practical engineering situations, the process disturbances in this study are assumed not to be completely decoupled. In the first part of this paper, the existence condition of such an UIO is proposed to facilitate the fault estimation for linear systems subjected to process disturbances. In the second part, robust fault estimation techniques are addressed for Lipschitz nonlinear systems subjected to both process <b>and</b> sensor disturbances. <b>The</b> proposed technique is finally illustrated by the simulation studies of a three-shaft gas turbine engine and a single-link flexible joint robot...|$|R
