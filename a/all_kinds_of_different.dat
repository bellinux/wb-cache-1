25|$|In 2010, {{a fierce}} debate {{occurred}} about {{the rate of}} profit between leading Marxist economists from various political organizations in Western Europe and North America. According to the French Marxist economist Michel Husson, there were basically four bones of contention: (1) how had the average rate of profit in industries evolved since the early 1980s, in the larger developed capitalist countries? (2) what is the theoretical status of the tendential fall {{in the rate of}} profit in the Marxist analysis? (3) {{what is the nature of}} the capitalist crisis today? (4) what is the political relevance of this discussion? However, there was very little agreement about concepts, measurement principles, and political perspectives among participants. According to some (like Michel Husson) the rate of profit had gone up again since 1980, while others (like Andrew Kliman) thought it had stayed down. <b>All</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> political conclusions were being drawn from the econometric evidence. The traditional orthodox Marxist narrative is that capitalist crises are crises of profitability: the economic disturbance is caused by the circumstance that capitalists are making insufficient profits, and not because there are insufficient goods for everybody. That situation is bound to happen, because of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. Once workers understand that, they can break with illusions about reforming capitalism, and prepare for revolution. Critics point out, however, that this kind of interpretation is problematic. There are two main reasons.|$|E

The housewives’ association in Västervik arranged <b>all</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> activities, for example, presentations of various household products, studying and charity work. As previous research has stated, the association could not really influence those in power, even if they were represented in numerous boards and wanted to reform many aspects of the society. The association’s strength was their impact on the local society and that they meant a great deal to those who were involved in their communion. The analysis of the results indicated that the housewives’ association mainly wanted to establish the woman as a stereotypical maternal woman. Furthermore, the investigation showed that the association in Västervik reduced their activities between 1950 and 1978, and this can be related to the historical context of Sweden during this time period, for example, the changing role of women in the society...|$|R

It has the same accuracy and all the capabilities of the popular Standard Leontief Price (SLP) model. A distinct advantage of the new approach compared with the SLP model, however, is its ability to measure the impact of the initial price shock on all value-added components if and when it is required. This capability enables researchers to use interindustry price analysis to tackle problems of a more real-world nature. Other advantages of this approach are its simple computational implementation, especially relevant for larger size interindustry tables, the unified way to deal with <b>all</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> price issues, and the yielding of an adjusted interindustry table reflecting all endogenous price adjustments in response to the initial price shock.

40|$|Latrine {{cleanliness}} {{is important}} to ensure the beneficial effects of access to sanitation on health and well-being. Behavior change interventions {{may be necessary to}} enhance the regular cleaning of facilities and therefore it is necessary to understand what influences cleanliness. Three empirical studies were conducted in rural Burundi to find contextual and psychosocial factors influencing latrine cleanliness, to plan and evaluate an intervention based on these findings, and to understand how general hygiene practice influences latrine cleanliness. Overall, the results emphasize the importance of psychosocial and contextual factors for latrine cleanliness. It makes sense to promote behavior change, as habitual latrine cleaning was the most important predictor of latrine cleanliness. Latrine cleanliness was also related to characteristics of the quality of latrine construction and encouraging households {{to improve the quality of}} their latrines could further enhance cleanliness. Psychosocial factors, especially commitment strength and positive emotions towards cleaning, and satisfaction with latrine cleanliness were important predictors for habitual latrine cleaning and should therefore be targeted by behavior change promotions. Moreover, the results for general hygiene practice suggest that it {{is important to}} examine latrine cleanliness not in isolation but within the broader perspective of general hygiene as <b>all</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> hygiene behaviors were interrelated...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, a novel stain free {{detection}} system for slab gel electrophoresis is examined. Currently, stained techniques {{are used to}} identify electrophoretic bands in gels. The stains utilized in these methods involve health risks since they are mutagenic. Also stains like EtBr are intercalating agents meaning they wedge themselves into the grooves of DNA and stay there. Since this includes a physical contact the stains remain in the DNA {{at the end of}} the experiment. This makes further use DNA very difficult. The stains need to be removed by chemical techniques which are timewise very costly. Also these operations are very inefficient, retrieve rates are very low which leads to waste of most of the analyte. The specific method we addressed aims to eliminate the use <b>of</b> any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> stains and therefore inherently increase the end product efficiency. The method introduces the absorption method as the means of detection. The physical law governing the absorption technique is the Beer-Lambert Law. The Beer-Lambert Law defines the linear relation, which correlates absorption value to the analyte concentration, path length of the light and wavelength-dependent absorptivity coefficient. Although the proposed method is intended to apply to <b>all</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> analytes, to achieve primary goals and prove the feasibility of the method, as the first step detection of DNA molecules are targeted. Hence absorption pattern at a wavelength of 254 nm (which is characteristic absorption peak for DNA) is examined. After the method is proven to work robustly, it will be extended to <b>all</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> analytes. The unique approach used in the proposed {{detection system}} is the use of a scanning technique incorporated with absorption technique utilizing a high QE (Quantum efficiency) CCD camera as the detector. Experiments have been performed to determine the only unknown parameter -wavelength-dependent absorptivity coefficient a([gamma]) - in the Beer-Lambert Law. The value of a([gamma]) is dependent on the wavelength and also on the transmission media. In our case wavelength of interest is 254 nm and the specific transmission media is agarose gel with 0. 8 % concentration. Each lane in the agarose gel is scanned under UV light and transmittance values at 254 nm are recorded as a function of position. The recorded data are processed to see the absorption pattern along the lane. The drop in the signal indicates the existence of a DNA band. Experiments have been performed on three different agarose gels, which are 4 mm thick, and with 0. 8 % concentration. The value of wavelength-dependent absorptivity coefficient a([gamma]) was determined within an error margin. The resolution of the method was found to be 4 ng/[mu]l. by Namik Kemal Yilmaz. Thesis (S.

The freedom is used to give the phenomenologically correct mass matrices <b>all</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> forms {{and this is one}} of the reasons for the proliferation of models for the fermionic masses. The SM must be however extended and in most extensions, RH currents appear at higher energy scales. At those energies the RH rotations are not irrelevant any more, they can affect neutrino oscillations, proton decay, baryon assymetry, R-parity violating interactions etc. We study possible implications of large RH mixing in GUTs. Those are interesting not only because large mixing induce large effects. They are intimately related to large lepton mixing in GUTs, via a relation between LH mixing of the leptons and the RH ones of the d-quarks,("d - ℓ duality") and can change considerably the branching ratios of proton decay. Observation of proton decay channels as well as neutrino oscillations will teach us about RH rotations and will reduce, therefore, considerably the freedom in the fermionic mass matrices. Some interesting examples are studied in detail. In particular a new E_ 6 model which realizes naturally a d - ℓ duality by mixing with exotic E_ 6 fermions.

Currently {{there are only a}} few biomarkers available to help the physician select the appropriate targeted drug for the patient and often tumor tissue is required for biomarker assays. Immunoscintigraphy might be able to improve diagnostic imaging, to guide antibody based therapy and to support early antibody development. Many different radiopharmaceuticals have been developed and used to visualize <b>all</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> targets especially in oncology. Intact radiolabeled antibodies generally show high tumor uptake but low tumor-to-blood ratios, particularly at early time points. Radiolabeled antibody fragments and proteins show widely differing values for tumor uptake and tumor-to-blood contrast. One of the promising targets for visualization might be HER 2 /neu. HER 2 /neu scans may prove useful for tumor staging, guiding of targeted therapy and measuring target occupancy in early drug development. Immunoscintigraphic clinical studies performed with intact antibodies indicate that HER 2 /neu imaging is feasible.

As well, network effects are significant in many of the innovation processes and their influence can be critical to the final success of the introduction of the technology in the industry. For this reason, this thesis will inductively develop a framework with the key factors for the diffusion of this particular case of disruptive innovations with the influence of network effects. To realize the study several historical cases have been used but the analysis is focused on the real-time case of the electric vehicle (EV) and its introduction in the automotive market. It is a perfect example as the necessity of charging infrastructure installed is critical for the diffusion of the technology, which means that indirect network effects and how to deal with them will have a key role. The study will offer propositions on the most important discussions of the case like the standardization process, the chicken-egg paradox on the charging infrastructure, the AC/DC technologies discussion or the geographical drivers that make some markets more suitable for the EV introduction than others. This thesis will have contribution to the theory trying to fill the gap in the literature, explaining the combination between network effects and disruptive innovations, as well as implications to the management being useful for the understanding of the development similar cases and helping them to make future decisions...|$|R
