5|$|In the Jamia Hafsa complex, {{damage was}} extensive, with {{thousands}} of bullet holes in the courtyard. The basement was blackened from rockets. The main buildings of the complex were structurally intact, but the boundary walls had been breached in several places. The building had bullet marks in its cement structure. The two courtyards inside the school were filled with shattered glass and spent rounds. Piles of the girls' bed rolls <b>and</b> <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> books were piled against walls.|$|E
5|$|Cropping {{systems can}} be {{modified}} to favor natural enemies, a practice {{sometimes referred to as}} habitat manipulation. Providing a suitable habitat, such as a shelterbelt, hedgerow, or beetle bank where beneficial insects such as parasitoidal wasps can live and reproduce, can help ensure the survival of populations of natural enemies. Things as simple as leaving a layer of fallen leaves or mulch in place provides a suitable food source for worms and provides a shelter for insects, in turn being a food source for such beneficial mammals as hedgehogs and shrews. Compost piles <b>and</b> <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> wood can provide shelter for invertebrates and small mammals. Long grass and ponds support amphibians. Not removing dead annuals and non-hardy plants in the autumn allows insects to make use of their hollow stems during winter. In California, prune trees are sometimes planted in grape vineyards to provide an improved overwintering habitat or refuge for a key grape pest parasitoid. The providing of artificial shelters in the form of wooden caskets, boxes or flowerpots is also sometimes undertaken, particularly in gardens, to make a cropped area more attractive to natural enemies. For example, earwigs are natural predators which can be encouraged in gardens by hanging upside-down flowerpots filled with straw or wood wool. Green lacewings can be encouraged by using plastic bottles with an open bottom and a roll of cardboard inside. Birdhouses enable insectivorous birds to nest; the most useful birds can be attracted by choosing an opening just large enough for the desired species.|$|E

500|$|Powerful winds induced {{substantial}} destruction throughout other {{portions of}} the state. The diary of William Bentley featured an account on the hurricane, describing the destruction of two barns in Salem {{and the death of}} a horse. The property of Paul Revere and Bentley's own house suffered considerable injury, and in nearby Nahant, many buildings' roofs were hurled away by intense gusts. Bentley also observed the unusual abundance of seaweed which was swept inland during the aftermath of the storm. Where snow fell it was mainly heavy, with reports of snowfall totaling [...] in the Berkshires and up to [...] near Stockbridge; however, no accumulation was measured in Boston and Worcester due to higher-than-optimal temperatures. In Abington, the hurricane not only impacted the shipping industry but also inflicted severe damage to oak and pine forests. Severe damage was inflicted to crops {{as a result of the}} storm, with potatoes freezing, apples tossed from branches, <b>and</b> <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> hay ruined. Livestock also encountered noteworthy losses, with [...] "large numbers" [...] of cattle, sheep, and fowl having died near Walpole, Newbury, and Topsfield– over a hundred cattle died at Topsfield alone.|$|E

The WFM Executive Board fully sanctioned their strike, he told them. He had told reporters that the WFM had all kinds of money, piles <b>and</b> <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> it. He assured the strikers that benefits would be forthcoming: the WFM had $161,000 [...] "in cash here"; an assessment of $2 had been levied for September on each WFM member—90,000 of them, Moyer had said, doubling the actual membership figure. The $161,000 had included the loans he hoped to procure, but he did not tell them that. Rather, he depicted a financially secure WFM, ready and able to finance the strike, a characterization that was most unreal. The strikers passed resolutions calling for a Senate investigation, protesting the militia, and denouncing the deputies.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{deformation}} <b>and</b> <b>stacking</b> <b>of</b> graphene {{significantly affect}} the overall electronic and mechanical properties. The graphene sheets are easily stacked each other due to van der Waals attraction. The folded characteristic may prevent graphene <b>stacking</b> <b>and</b> increase the d-spacing between graphenes. It can easily form dense graphene structures with high surface area and be applied on electrode materials of battery, nano-composites and so on. The traditional topographic mapping of {{atomic force microscope}} (AFM) is hard to measure the characters of surface deformation and distinguish the folding <b>and</b> <b>stacking.</b> In this study, we apply a novel quantitative nano-mechanical AFM to analyze the reduced-graphene oxide (r-GO). The {{results indicate that the}} novel AFM system could recognize the difference between folding <b>and</b> <b>stacking</b> <b>of</b> r-GO effectively. Nevertheless, the images including topography, deformation, adhesion, and elastic modulus show the different phenomena between measuring region, which appears that status on measuring region are folding <b>and</b> <b>stacking,</b> respectively...|$|R
