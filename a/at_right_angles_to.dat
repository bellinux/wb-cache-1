5|$|Since then, many {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} measuring such dragging coefficients, often {{in combination with the}} Sagnac effect. For instance, in experiments using ring lasers together with rotating disks, or in neutron interferometric experiments.

5|$|Even {{following}} the conversion to cylindrical smokeboxes, {{it was still}} possible to distinguish some non-streamliners from ex-streamliners. On the former (Nos. 46230-46234 and 46249-46252, but not 46253-46257) the running plates veered downwards <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> <b>to</b> connect with the buffer beam {{in the style of}} the Princess Royal Class. The ex-streamliners did not have any such connection, except No.46242 City of Glasgow which was rebuilt in 1952 following a serious collision.|$|E
5|$|The {{inner ear}} sits within the {{temporal}} bone in a complex cavity called the bony labyrinth. A central area known as the vestibule contains two small fluid-filled recesses, the utricle and saccule. These connect to the semicircular canals and the cochlea. There are three semicircular canals angled <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> <b>to</b> each other which are responsible for dynamic balance. The cochlea is a spiral shell-shaped organ responsible for the sense of hearing. These structures together create the membranous labyrinth.|$|E

5|$|When {{movement}} is required, one {{strategy is to}} minimise the motion signal, for example by avoiding waving limbs about and by choosing patterns that do not cause flicker when seen by the prey from straight ahead. Cuttlefish may be doing this with their active camouflage by choosing to form stripes <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> <b>to</b> their front-back axis, minimising motion signals that would be given by occluding and displaying the pattern as they swim.|$|E

The body in the revolving orbit must also start at right angles and assume its speed is v. In the case shown in Fig. 1., v > V and the force is directed towards S. The argument applies equally if v < V. Also, the force may be directed away from the centre.|$|E
5|$|The Austrians briefly {{took the}} {{advantage}} {{when they moved}} a battery from the ridge north of the village to cover their infantry; the fire from the battery allowed the infantry to deploy <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> <b>to</b> their original front. Frederick responded by ordering {{the last of his}} reserved left wing to advance, but the Austrian battery drove it back. Finally, Frederick's heavy cannons on the Butterberg, a small knoll to the west of town, laid down a barrage. Some participants said it was this barrage, more than the Prussian infantry, which won the battle.|$|E

Among the many shops are two large modern supermarkets, both in Edith Walk, formerly a steep and unmade lane that served the rear entrances of the shops in Church Street. Most of the traditional high street shops such as butchers, bakers, grocers etc., are now health food shops, art and craft shops, charity shops, law firms, and estate agents.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakness}} of the plan was that, politically at least, it abandoned most of eastern Belgium to the Germans. Militarily it would put the Allied rear <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> <b>to</b> the French frontier defences; while for the British, their communications located at the Bay of Biscay ports, would be parallel to their front. Despite the risk of committing forces to central Belgium and an advance to the Schedlt or Dyle lines, which would be vulnerable to an outflanking move, Maurice Gamelin, the French commander, approved the plan and it remained the Allied strategy upon the outbreak of war.|$|E

40|$|On {{decarburization}} {{mechanism of}} carbon steels and white cast irons have already studied by many investigators for varied composition. In this paper, the investigators acted decarburization treatment at 750 ℃for ten hours in air {{and studied the}} effect or relationship of carbon content, rolling direction and <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> rolling direction on decarburization of carbon steels with carbon 0. 105, 0. 208, 0. 49 and 0. 64 % preceded by normalizing at appropriate temperature through mean of metallography. The results obtained are as follows : (1) Depth of decarburization of low carbon steels thicken more readily than high carbon steels at 750 ℃. (2) When carbon steels decarburize at 750 ℃, ferrite band become granular crystal unconcerned in carbon content. (3) When method of decarburization is the same, i seems that pre-treatment of specimens have a great influence upon depth of decarburization. (4) Depth decarburization <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> rolling direction thicken more readily than rolling direction...|$|R
5|$|Dynamic {{balance is}} {{provided}} through the three semicircular canals. These three canals are orthogonal (<b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles)</b> <b>to</b> each other. At {{the end of}} each canal is a slight enlargement, known as the ampulla, which contains numerous cells with filaments in a central area called the cupula. The fluid in these canals rotates according to the momentum of the head. When a person changes acceleration, the inertia of the fluid changes. This affects the pressure on the cupula, and results in the opening of ion channels. This causes depolarisation, which is passed as a signal to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve. Dynamic balance also helps maintain eye tracking when moving, via the vestibulo–ocular reflex.|$|E
5|$|Except for {{the corner}} houses, {{the houses were}} built in pairs, each sharing a porch with its neighbour. For many of the smaller fourth- and fifth-class houses, the doors were aligned <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> <b>to</b> the façade of the house, {{so as not to}} open {{directly}} adjacently to their neighbours. All houses were designed with at least one parlour and with the kitchen, scullery, and toilet in separate rooms {{at the rear of the}} house; the first-class houses also had toilets upstairs. In line with the design principles of the time, the downstairs toilets were accessible only from the back gardens, and the houses were not fitted with separate bathrooms; baths were taken in a moveable bath located in the kitchen.|$|E

St Mary on the Quay church was built between 1839 and 1843, by Richard Shackleton Pope, as a Catholic apostolic chapel for the Irvingite congregation: it is now a Roman Catholic church.|$|E

5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle is an {{opportunistic}} carnivore and consumes a {{wide variety}} of animal prey, including carrion. It often catches a fish by flying low over the water and grasping it in its talons. It prepares for the strike by holding its feet far forward (almost under its chin) and then strikes backwards while simultaneously beating its wings to lift upwards. Generally only one foot is used to seize prey. The white-bellied sea eagle may also dive at a 45 degree angle from its perch and briefly submerge to catch fish near the water surface. While hunting over water on sunny days, it often flies directly into the sun or <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> <b>to</b> it, seemingly to avoid casting shadows over the water and hence alerting potential prey.|$|E
5|$|When a stem is developing, {{the fungus}} is {{negatively}} geotropic, {{so that if}} the axis of the stem is tilted by 90 degrees, it will return to a vertical position within 24 hours. The extending hyphae that form the cap are themselves diageotropic—they will grow <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> <b>to</b> the direction of gravity. Finally, the spines are positively geotropic, and will re-orient themselves to point downward if the mushroom orientation changes. Because the second (cap formation) and third (spine formation) geotropic responses overlap, there is a brief period where two different geotropic responses are operating simultaneously. These geotropic transitions help ensure that the final alignment results in optimum spore dispersal.|$|E
5|$|It {{is mounted}} on a {{rectangular}} cast-iron column of two-tons weight that rests on the masonry pier. Through a glass door in the column {{you can see the}} driving clock that keeps the telescope turning westward just as fast as the stars go, so that a star remains in view as long as the astronomer wishes to observe it. The telescope turns on two axes {{at the top of the}} column. One axis slants upwards toward the north pole of the heavens; the other <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> <b>to</b> it, and it is to this one that the tube of the telescope is attached. Two large circles provide graduated scales for locating objects by their coordinates. The instrument can be turned on these axes toward any part of the sky.
