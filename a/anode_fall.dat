40|$|An {{array of}} {{diagnostic}} techniques {{was used to}} study anode phenomena in quasisteady self-field MPD thrusters operated at power levels between 150 kW and 7 MW with argon and helium propellants. Spatially resolved anode heat flux measurements were made by embedding thermocouples to the inner surface of a hollowed section of the anode. These measurements indicate that at a thruster power level of 1 MW over 40 % of the input power was deposited into the anode while at 7 MW this fraction decreased to less than 20 %. The peak measured anode heat flux was approximately 10 kW/cm 2. Electron temperature and anode current densities were measured via Langmuir and magnetic probes, respectively, which with heat flux measurements permitted {{an estimate of the}} <b>anode</b> <b>fall</b> to be made. In addition, floating probes, which were used to measure the <b>anode</b> <b>fall,</b> served as a second means of estimating the anode heat flux. Comparison of <b>anode</b> <b>fall</b> data acquired through either method showed excellent agreement. Anode falls varied between 4 and 50 V for both argon and helium propellants. Furthermore, the <b>anode</b> <b>fall</b> was found to correlate well with electron Hall parameters calculated from triple Langmuir and magnetic probe data collected near the anode. Two possible explanations for this result are proposed: the establishment of large electric fields at the anode to maintain current conduction across the strong magnetic fields; anomalous resistivity resulting from the onset of microturbulence in the plasma. To investigate the latter hypothesis, electric field, magnetic field, and current density profiles measured {{in the vicinity of the}} anode were incorporated into Ohm’s law to estimate electrical conductivity. Results of this analysis show a substantial deviation of the measured conductivity from that calculated with classical formulae. These results imply that anomalous effects are present in the plasma near the anode.

40|$|Anode power {{deposition}} is {{the principal}} performance limiter of magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thrusters. Current thrusters lose between 50 and 70 percent of the input power to the anode. In this work, anode power deposition was studied for three cylindrical applied magnetic field thrusters {{for a range of}} argon propellant flow rates, discharge currents, and applied-field strengths. Between 60 and 95 percent of the anode power depositions resulted from electron current conduction into the anode, with cathode radiation depositing between 5 and 35 percent of the anode power, and convective heat transfer from the hot plasma accounting for less than 5 percent. While the fractional anode power loss decreased with increasing applied-field strength and anode size, the magnitude of the anode power increased. The rise in anode power resulted from a linear rise in the <b>anode</b> <b>fall</b> voltage with applied-field strength and anode radius.

40|$|Abstract. From {{current and}} voltage measurements, {{together}} with microwave diagnostics, the energy cost per newly produced electron in diffuse volumetric air plasmas sustained by high repetition rate high-voltage nanosecond pulses (2 ns, 100 kHz, 5 kV/cm) {{was found to}} be on the order of 100 eV, two orders of magnitude lower than in quasineutral DC and RF plasmas. In the experiments, peak electron number densities between 5 × 1011 and 1012 cm- 3 were produced. Modeling of plasma dynamics yielded the energy cost of ionization in good agreement with the experimental values. Both experiments and modeling revealed that the ionization cost per electron in these plasmas is relatively insensitive to the gas density. Detailed investigations of the plasma dynamics revealed a critical role of the cathode sheath that was found to take up most of the peak voltage applied to the electrodes. The extremely high E/N, much higher than the Stoletov’s field at the Paschen minimum point, results in a very high ionization cost in the sheath. In contrast, the E/N in the quasineutral plasma is closer to that associated with the Stoletov’s point, resulting in a near-optimal electron generation. The positive space charge in the sheath and its relatively slow relaxation due to the low ion mobility was also found to result in reversal of electric field direction in the plasma at the tail of the high-voltage pulse. Using the short, high repetition rate, high voltage pulses to ionize a Mach 3 (600 m/sec), MHD power extraction from cold air has been demonstrated. A few tens of milliwatts were extracted from the 3 -cm cube region of ionization, which would scale to hundreds of kilowatts of power in higher velocity, larger scale devices that would be appropriate for hypersonic flight. Modeling predictions were found to be in agreement with experimentally extracted Faraday current measured between the high voltage pulses.

5000|$|The {{reason for}} the limited {{applicability}} of the screen-grid valve, and its rapid replacement by the RF pentode (introduced around 1930) was the peculiar anode characteristic (i.e. variation of anode current with respect to anode voltage) of the former type of tube.In normal applications, the anode voltage was about 150V, while that of the screen-grid was about 60V (Thrower p 183). [...] As the screen grid is positive {{with respect to the}} cathode, it collects a certain fraction (perhaps a quarter) of the electrons which would otherwise pass from the grid region to the anode. This causes current to flow in the screen grid circuit. Usually, the screen current due to this cause is small, and of little interest. However, if the anode voltage should be below that of the screen, the screen grid can also collect secondary electrons ejected from the anode by the impact of the energetic primary electrons. Both effects tend to reduce the anode current. If the anode voltage is increased from a low value, with the screen grid at its normal operating voltage (60V, say) the anode current initially increases rapidly because more of those electrons which pass through the screen-grid are collected by the anode rather than passing back to the screen grid. This part of the tetrode anode characteristic resembles the corresponding part of that of a triode or pentode. However, when the anode voltage is increased further, the electrons arriving at the anode have sufficient energy to cause copious secondary emission, and many of these secondary electrons will be captured by the screen, which is at a higher positive voltage than the anode. This causes the <b>anode</b> current to <b>fall</b> rather than increase when the anode voltage is increased. In some cases the anode current can actually become negative (current flows out of the anode); this is possible since each primary electron may produce more than one secondary. Falling positive anode current accompanied by rising anode voltage gives the anode characteristic a region of negative slope, and this corresponds to a negative resistance which can cause instability in certain circuits. In a higher range of anode voltage, the anode voltage sufficiently exceeds that of the screen for an increasing proportion of the secondary electrons to be attracted back to the anode, so the anode current increases once more, and the slope of the anode characteristic becomes positive again. In a yet higher range of anode voltages, the anode current becomes substantially constant, since all of the secondary electrons now return to the anode, and the main control of current through the tube is the voltage of the control grid. This is the normal operating mode of the tube.|$|R
40|$|Anode power {{deposition}} is {{a dominant}} power loss mechanism for arc jets and MPD thrusters. In this study, a free burning arc experiment was operated at pressures and current densities {{similar to those}} in arc jets and MPD thrusters in an attempt to identify the physics controlling this loss mechanism. Use of a free burning arc allowed for the isolation of independent variables controlling anode power deposition and provided a convenient and flexible way to cover a broad range of currents, anode surface pressures, and applied magnetic field strengths and orientations using an argon gas. Test results showed that anode power deposition decreased with increasing anode surface pressure up to 6. 7 Pa (0. 05 torr) and then became insensitive to pressure. Anode power increased with increasing arc current while the electron number density near the anode surface increased linearity. Anode power also increased with increasing applied magnetic field strength due to an increasing <b>anode</b> <b>fall</b> voltage. Applied magnetic field orientation had an effect only at high currents and low anode surface pressures, where anode power decreased when applied field lines intercepted the anode surface. The results demonstrated that anode power deposition was dominated by the current carrying electrons and that the <b>anode</b> <b>fall</b> voltage was the largest contributor.

A new MPDT was developed and operated with quasi-steady 1 ms pulses from 36 kW to 3. 3 MW with argon propellant. Three magnetic configurations studied included self-field operation (without external electromagnets) and two applied poloidal magnetic fields. One configuration used magnetic field lines tangential to the anode lip (and intersecting the anode further upstream) and the other created a magnetic cusp intersecting the anode downstream. The influence of the applied fields on the discharge current streamlines, current densities, and key plasma properties (electron temperature, number density, and plasma potential) was studied. Key findings included that the current pattern and current densities redistributed to follow the applied magnetic field lines. Also, the <b>anode</b> <b>fall</b> voltage was substantially reduced with both applied fields over a large range of currents (and eliminated at 8 kA).

40|$|Abstract- This {{review is}} {{concerned}} with energy transport in current-carrying, thermal plasinas, in particular with energy transport close to and at the anode surface of high intensity arcs. Experimental studies of the anode region of such arcs at atmospheric pressure reveal two types of anode arc roots which strongly affect the heat flux distribution. In relatively short arcs {{the action of the}} cathode jet leads to a diffuse anode attachment (cathode jet dominated mode). In contrast, simulations of long arcs clearly demonstrate a more or less severe constriction of the current path in front of the anode inducing an anode jet (anode jet dominated mode). Modeling of the anode region under identical conditions confirms that the "natural " arc attachment in this situation will always be constricted, resulting in extremely high specific heat fluxes at the anode. The analysis also shows that enthalpy transport by the electrons is the dominating heat transfer mechanism in the ano. de region. An analysis of the anode boundary layer of high current atmospheric pressure arcs indicates that presently available <b>anode</b> <b>fall</b> theories are not adequate for describing this zone. A one-dimensional analysis of the nearanode zone predicts negative anode falls in the range from one to three volts depending on the anode current density and on the plasma temperature. The electron temperature is substantially elevated over the temperature of the heavy particles close to the anode. Because of negative anode falls, the anode heat transfer model will no longer contain a term due to the <b>anode</b> <b>fall.</b> It is felt that this finding will be of great practical significance for the prediction of anode heat transfer in arc furnaces and in other applications which employ transferred arcs.

This 'quasi-steady' discharge form is characterized by constant terminal voltage and current, a diffuse, fixed current distribution within the discharge, and a steady plasma efflux at velocities of approximately 20 km/sec. Measured potential distributions reveal that the bulk of the arc voltage gradient, exclusive of the electrode falls, occurs within two diameters of the cathode, and is normal to it.

40|$|The cathode and the <b>anode</b> <b>fall</b> of the DC arcs are {{measured}} by fast oscilloscope for Ag-CdO contacts over {{a range of}} gap-lengths from 0. 05 mm to 1 mm, and currents of 4 - 10 Amps at atmospheric pressure, with a known electrode closing speed, using the Moving Electrode Method. It was observed that the <b>anode</b> <b>fall</b> can occur in a few places within the arc voltage waveform, and is dependent of the electrodes' surface condition. Both cathode and anode falls increase with gap-length and decrease with current. It was found that when arc length is shorter than electrode separation, discontinuity within the arc voltage waveform during closure is caused, in many cases, by vapourisation of the first point of contact or by a high electric field set up between the two electrodes. These discontinuities are named as Voltage Step Phenomena. These voltage steps {{are related to the}} cathode and <b>anode</b> <b>fall</b> voltages, and their regular occurrences are a function of surface roughness. The fluctuations in the arc voltage waveform are thought to originate mainly from the cathode. A technique has been developed to measure the temperature of the electrodes accurately by using a T-type thermocouple, 0. 075 mm diameter, in conjunction with a DC amplifier with a gain of 247. The thermocouple is placed as close as possible under the electrode surface (200 µm). This enables the temperature of the contact to be measured, after breaking contact, for an arc-duration even as short as 1 ms. The time-constant of the probe (contact containing the thermocouple) is measured to be approximately 18 ms. With this technique the temperature of the electrodes {{are measured}} for currents and gap-lengths ranging 4 - 10 Amps and 0. 05 - 1 mm respectively. The effect of contacts being new and change of polarity have been investigated. From these results it is concluded that the co-existence of layers of foreign material on one, or both, surfaces causes the temperature of the electrodes to be high for the first 50 - 100 operations, before reaching to steady-state conditions. Change of polarity suggests that the moving electrode, either anode or cathode, due to the effect of air movement over its surface, is cooled relative to when fixed. The power transfer to the electrodes is calculated for various currents and gap-length using thermal analogue formulae derived from the transient response of an RC circuit to a d. c. pulse. The results show that below 0. 2 mm the sum of the anode and cathode power is approximately equal to the arc power, and hence losses are negligible. At around 0. 125 mm, for currents of about 6 A and 12 A, they both receive an equal amount of power from the arc. This has been related to the thermal energy of the electrons being negligible, at such separation, at the anode end of the plasma column. The power balance equations are solved to calculate the positive ion current to the cathode, and the thermal energy of the electrons in the plasma column, under various test conditions. In the investigation of erosion, the S. E. M. studies show that most of the power dissipated {{on the surface of the}} electrodes is used in melting and evaporation.

Anode falls varied between 4 - 50 V with anode power fractions reaching 70 percent with helium at 150 kW, and 50 percent with argon at 1. 9 MW. The <b>anode</b> <b>fall</b> was found to correlate well with electron Hall parameters calculated from triple Langmuir and magnetic probe data collected near the anode. Two possible explanations for this result are proposed: (1) the establishment of large electric fields at the anode to maintain current conduction across the strong magnetic fields; and (2) anomalous resistivity resulting from the onset of microturbulence in the plasma. To investigate the latter hypothesis, electric field, magnetic field, and current density profiles measured {{in the vicinity of the}} anode were incorporated into Ohm's law to estimate the electrical conductivity. Results of this analysis show a substantial deviation of the measured conductivity from that calculated with classical formulas. These results imply that anomalous effects are present in the plasma near the anode...|$|E

The {{behavior of the}} electric field together with the electron and ion densities {{in the vicinity of}} a nonemitting, plane anode is investigated. The selected approach involves non-linear analysis techniques on the continuum equations for steady-state, isothermal conditions where both ionization and two-body recombination are included. Ions, created through electron bombardment of neutral atoms, are repelled toward two stagnation regions: within or near the sheath boundary and near the plasma interface. These equilibria form {{as a result of the}} chemistry present: recombination establishes the latter while ionization stipulates the former. As presented, the sheath is fundamentally unstable - ions are driven toward the negative electrode. Using nitrogen data for a numeric example, the following observations are made: a sufficiently strong applied electric field pushes the ion density toward that ofthe electrons through a well - a constrictive phenomenon. Both a transition region, dominated by density gradients, and a diffusion-driven zone are found to move the system toward the plasma interface. The characteristics of this process are influenced by the applied electric field, but the instability of the chemistry-induced stagnation regions precludes numeric convergence. Insufficient dissipation may prevent the stability of the <b>anode</b> <b>fall</b> model as presented. Suggested improvements to the model descriptions include considering the effects of temperature gradients, magnetic fields, three-body recombination, diffusion written in terms of the electric field, multi-dimensionality and/or timedependencies^Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedMoving striations and anode oscillations were studied {{over a wide}} range of gas pressures and discharge currents in an argon glow discharge. Striation spacing, frequency and velocity were measured as a function of discharge current from low currents to the current for extinction of moving striations, for pressures from 1 to 16 mm Hg. Striation frequency was also measured as a function of pressure for various radii discharge tubes. The anode spot light oscillations were eliminated by use of an auxiliary anode discharge, which brought the positive column in contact with the anode and eliminated the oscillat­ing <b>anode</b> <b>fall</b> in potential. This change in the anode region produced no significant change in the striation parameters, but greatly reduced and altered the frequency of the poten­tial oscillations across the discharge tube. The potential oscillations now followed the wave form and frequency of the striation oscillations instead of the frequency of the anode spot oscillations. By use of a discharge tube, constructed with sections of different radius, moving striations in the positive column were isolated from both cathode and anode by sections of homogenous positive column in which no voltage oscillations were detectable by floating probes. This leads to the con­clusion that striations are due to an inherent instability of the positive column, and not to the effects developed by the anode or cathode.

40|$|The {{role of the}} {{electric}} arc in the consumption of electrodes in submerged arc furnaces has long been debated. The hostile environment in the furnace does not make direct measurement feasible, so simulation {{has been used to}} evaluate the arcs contribution to the erosion. Magnetofluiddynamic (MFD) electric arc simulations and a cathode / anode sub-model developed in order to provide boundary condition to the arc model have been used for this purpose. The cathode / anode sub-model provides current distributions and cathode / <b>anode</b> <b>fall</b> voltages for the arc and temperature distribution for the electrode surface, which is paramount to the ero-sion rate which in turn is calculated from the Clausius Clapeyron equation and the Hertz Knudsen formula for the vapour transport. In the case of high-current industrial AC arcs, arc currents are typically ~ 100 kA, phase voltages ~ 100 V and total furnace power ~ 10 – 60 MW. The results show that although enormous amounts of material is evaporated, much of it recondenses on the surface. Furthermore the results show that the arc erosion increases strongly with the arc current. If a single arc is present its contribution to erosion is close to the actual total erosion in the furnace. Results from this analysis indicate that there are possibly more than one arc present in the crater, in which case less than 40 % of the total erosion would be due to the arc, the rest is chemical erosion. 1...|$|E

Switched dc and sinusoidal currents are applied with amplitudes of several amps and operating frequencies being varied between 10 Hz and 10 kHz. The temperature is deduced from the grey body radiation of the electrode being recorded with a spectroscopic measuring system. Phase resolved {{values of the}} electrode tip temperature T tip and of the power input P in are determined comparing the measured temperature distributions with the integral of the one dimensional heat balance with these parameters as integration constants. They are supplemented by phase resolved measurements of the sum of cathode and <b>anode</b> <b>fall</b> called electrode sheath voltage. If a switched dc current is applied {{it is found that}} both quantities are within the cathodic phase only marginally higher than for a cathode being operated with a dc current. T tip and P in start to decrease for low currents and to increase for high currents {{at the beginning of the}} anodic phase. But with increasing operating frequency the deviations from the cathodic phase are reduced until they cannot be resolved for frequencies of several kHz. A more pronounced modulation but the same tendencies are observed with a sinusoidal current waveform. For 10 kHz a diffuse arc attachment with an almost phase independent electrode tip temperature, which deviates only marginally from that of a dc cathode, and an electrode sheath voltage proportional to the arc current is established with both current waveforms...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of a discharge across a magnetic field in a dusty plasma is analysed. The dust macroparticles are negatively charged, but are unmagnetized because of their high mass. The electrons are highly magnetized, and the ions have intermediate magnetization. This results in different transport rates of the different species across the magnetic field. Depending {{on the size of}} the magnetic field, and the relative charge on the different species, the dust grains can be the dominant current carrier. The space charge clouds near the electrodes will then be determined by the relative mobility of the different species. The discharge can operate in one of two modes, a positive space charge (PSC) mode, characterized by a strong cathode fall, and a negative space charge (NSC) mode, characterized by a broad <b>anode</b> <b>fall.</b> Features unique to the dust particles can also play a role in the {{structure of}} the discharge, such as the variable equilibrium charge on the grains, dependent on the local potential and species temperatures, the effect of gravity on the grain dynamics, and the rate of charging of the grains. The dust grains can also form an ordered structure, the dust-plasma crystal. A fluid model of the different species is used to calculate the structure of the resulting discharge, incorporating the above effects. The transition from the PSC mode to the NSC mode as the magnetic field, pressure and dust properties are varied is demonstrated.
