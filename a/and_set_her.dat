5|$|Elizabeth {{was held}} in the YMCA for nearly 200days, during which time the Kempeitai meticulously {{followed}} up every point in her story, cross-examining people she said she had helped. After a huge dossier of interviews had been compiled, the Japanese concluded that she was telling the truth <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>her</b> free. Khun Heng, however, was sentenced to 12years in Outram Road Prison. People avoided Elizabeth following her release, too terrified to speak to her. Fifteen internees died in the Kempeitais cells during the Double Tenth inquisition. The suffering spread to the entire civilian population of Changi Prison; rations were cut, and games, concerts, plays, and school lessons were forbidden for months.|$|E

When an incredulous Claire confronts him, Franks says that it was his plan all along to resign <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>her</b> up to be president, so {{that the two of them}} can run Washington together - she from the White House and he from the private sector. For the plan to work, Claire must pardon Frank, which would damage her politically. Frank resigns and Claire is sworn in as the 47th President of the United States.|$|E

The refusal of the eleventh vessel to surrender so enraged Roberts' crew that, under cover of night, they climbed aboard <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>her</b> on fire. The captured vessels were Slave ships, and the one set on fire had around eighty enslaved Africans on board. They perished either {{as a result of}} the fire or by drowning or shark attack after jumping overboard.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of 24 April, Farragut's fleet made its {{historic}} run past the Mississippi River forts that defended New Orleans from the south. Because the Rebel leaders had not coordinated {{the responsibilities of the}} forts and the associated river fleet, the action was divided into two independent parts. Each ship of the attacking column was past the forts before she had to contend with the defending Confederate vessels, which therefore received the undivided attention of the Yankee gunners when they met. Under the circumstances, only one of the River Defense Fleet managed to close with the enemy: Stonewall Jackson was able to ram USS Varuna while that unfortunate gunboat was simultaneously being rammed by Governor Moore of the Louisiana navy. Varuna sank, the only Federal ship lost that night. Stonewall Jackson did not escape unscathed. Holed by shots from other Federal ships assisting Varuna and unable to reply, she was run ashore by her crew, where they abandoned her <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>her</b> afire.|$|E
