5|$|For a {{small number}} of people, taking aspirin can result in {{symptoms}} resembling <b>an</b> <b>allergic</b> reaction, including hives, swelling, and headache. The reaction is caused by salicylate intolerance and is not a true allergy, but rather an inability to metabolize even small amounts of aspirin, resulting in an overdose.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, {{recurrent}} mouth ulcers may be {{a manifestation}} of <b>an</b> <b>allergic</b> reaction. Possible allergens include certain foods (e.g., chocolate, coffee, strawberries, eggs, nuts, tomatoes, cheese, citrus fruits, benzoates, cinnamaldehyde, and highly acidic foods), toothpastes, and mouthwashes. Where dietary allergens are responsible, mouth ulcers usually develop within about 12–24 hours of exposure.|$|E
5|$|Like other platinum-group metal, bulk Pd {{is quite}} inert. Although contact {{dermatitis}} has been reported, {{data on the}} effects are limited. It {{has been shown that}} people with <b>an</b> <b>allergic</b> reaction to palladium also react to nickel, making it advisable to avoid the use of dental alloys containing palladium on those so allergic.|$|E
50|$|Alpha-gal allergies {{are very}} similar to pork-cat {{syndrome}} and hence misidentification can occur. Pork-cat syndrome usually elicits <b>an</b> immediate <b>allergic</b> response, while <b>a</b> true alpha-gal allergy typically features <b>a</b> delayed <b>allergic</b> reaction of 3 to 8 hours after ingestion of the allergen.|$|R
5|$|Anaphylaxis is <b>a</b> serious <b>allergic</b> {{reaction}} that is rapid in onset and may cause death.|$|R
5000|$|Anaphylaxis: <b>a</b> whole-body <b>allergic</b> {{reaction}} that causes low blood pressure, suffocation and {{can bring a}} person to death.|$|R
5|$|Some {{susceptible}} {{individuals have}} experienced <b>an</b> <b>allergic</b> reaction after touching Suillus americanus. The symptoms of {{allergic contact dermatitis}} generally develop one to two days after initial contact, persist for roughly a week, then disappear without treatment. Cooking the fruit bodies inactivates the responsible allergens.|$|E
5|$|Candace {{discovers the}} boy's circus and has {{set out to}} tell their mother, Linda, when Jeremy, a boy who has romantic {{feelings}} for her, stops by {{to give her a}} basket of plants. Unfortunately they include some wild parsnips, which give Candace <b>an</b> <b>allergic</b> reaction: to hide her hives and deep, scratchy voice she dons a sweatsuit and a paper bag before going to the mall to tell Linda about the boys' plans, and then sings E.V.I.L. B.O.Y.S. where Linda, Vivian Garcia-Shapiro, and Jeremy's mom are.|$|E
5|$|If {{no signs}} of <b>an</b> <b>allergic</b> {{reaction}} are present, an ice pack or commercially available sprays are used to relieve the pain. Stingose is also recommended to treat a jack jumper sting. Other treatments include washing the stung area with soap and water, and if continuous pain remains for several days, antihistamine tablets are taken for one to three days.|$|E
50|$|Penicillin {{desensitization}} {{is a type}} of desensitization {{which serves}} to decrease <b>a</b> person's <b>allergic</b> response to the antibiotic penicillin.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Malory becomes {{temporally}} blinded {{after having}} <b>an</b> <b>allergic</b> reaction to zucchini. Seeing {{this as an}} opportunity to help themselves, secretary Cheryl and human resources representative Pam hack into the ISIS computer mainframe from Malory's office and alter their files, allowing them better health care and other perks they can not afford themselves. The whole time, Malory rants about how disgruntled she is about her own and others' life choices.|$|E
5|$|More {{problems}} ensued during filming: Paul Le Mat {{was sent}} to the hospital after <b>an</b> <b>allergic</b> reaction to walnuts. Le Mat, Harrison Ford and Bo Hopkins were claimed to be drunk most nights and every weekend, and had conducted climbing competitions {{to the top of the}} local Holiday Inn sign. One actor set fire to Lucas's motel room. Another night, Le Mat threw Richard Dreyfuss into a swimming pool, gashing Dreyfuss' forehead on the day before he was due to have his close-ups filmed. Dreyfuss also complained over the wardrobe that Lucas had chosen for the character. Ford was kicked out of his motel room at the Holiday Inn. In addition, two camera operators were nearly killed when filming the climactic race scene on Frates Road outside Petaluma. Principal photography ended on August 4, 1972.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} {{treatment}} for a Myrmecia sting depends on {{the severity of the}} reaction. If no signs of <b>an</b> <b>allergic</b> reaction are seen, an ice pack or commercially available spray is used to relieve the pain. Washing the stung area, stingose, and the use of antihistamine tablets are other methods to reduce the pain. Indigenous Australians use bush remedies to treat Myrmecia stings, such as rubbing the tips of bracken ferns onto the stung area. Carpobrotus glaucescens is also used to treat stung areas, using juices that are squeezed and rubbed onto the area, which quickly relieves the pain from the sting.|$|E

5|$|Adler's throat closes {{up during}} the MRI due to <b>an</b> <b>allergic</b> {{reaction}} to gadolinium, prompting two members of House's team, Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), to perform a tracheotomy. Working in the hospital's clinic, House's first patient {{is a man who}} is orange because of an over-consumption of carrots and mega-dose vitamins (niacin). House also treats a ten-year-old boy whose mother allows him to use his asthmatic inhaler only intermittently instead of daily as prescribed. House criticises the mother for making such a drastic medical decision without first learning more about asthma. During his monologue, House stumbles on an idea and leaves quickly to treat Adler; he diagnoses her with cerebral vasculitis, despite having no proof. House treats Adler with steroids, which improves her condition greatly for a time, until she starts seizing and has heart failure. The team brings her back with a defibrillator.|$|E
5|$|At the wedding, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) {{arrives with}} her husband Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy), where Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) surprises them with a baby, his son Drake, that he had with a former girlfriend who then {{abandoned}} them both. Jim tells Dwight that under Schrute tradition, he {{is not allowed to}} be best man as he is younger than him. Jim surprises him with the arrival of Michael Scott (Steve Carell). The wedding proceeds in Schrute tradition with Michael as Dwight's new best man. At the reception, Michael shows Pam pictures of his kids with Holly Flax, and Pam notes that he is paying for two phones just to hold all the images. Ryan deliberately gives Drake <b>an</b> <b>allergic</b> reaction so that Ravi, a pediatrician, can attend and Ryan can steal Kelly away. Kevin tells Ravi that Ryan wanted him to keep Drake so that Ryan can have Kelly and the two can start a new life together. Ravi then gives Kevin the baby to give to Child Services before leaving, but Nellie, who has still been wanting a child, takes Drake instead.|$|E
5|$|Often {{considered}} a poor {{relation of the}} cep (Boletus edulis), the bay bolete is nevertheless highly regarded as a choice edible mushroom by some authors such as Carluccio. In central Mexico, it is collected from Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park and sold in neighbouring markets. It may cause <b>an</b> <b>allergic</b> reaction in some people, and the blue discolouration upon bruising can be offputting, although the staining disappears from white flesh when it is cooked. The flavour is milder than its better-known relative. Younger specimens are best for eating, though more mature ones can be suitable for cutting up and drying. The tendency for the pores to absorb water means that wiping rather than washing is recommended before use in the kitchen. Unlike most boletes, I.badia can be eaten raw (though only young mushrooms should be used). Otherwise it can be fried in butter, or used with meat or fish recipes. Mushrooms can also be frozen, dried, or pickled in cider vinegar, wine, or extra virgin olive oil, and later used in sauces or soups.|$|E
50|$|The two {{contraindications}} {{to taking}} ezetimibe are <b>a</b> previous <b>allergic</b> reaction including rash, angioedema, and anaphylaxis, and severe liver disease, especially when {{taken with a}} statin.|$|R
2500|$|The rash is {{described}} as maculopapular or morbilliform (measles-like; therefore, in medical literature, it is called [...] "amoxicillin-induced morbilliform rash".). It starts on the trunk and can spread from there. This rash {{is unlikely to be}} <b>a</b> true <b>allergic</b> reaction and is not a contraindication for future amoxicillin usage, nor should the current regimen necessarily be stopped. However, this common amoxicillin rash and <b>a</b> dangerous <b>allergic</b> reaction cannot easily be distinguished by inexperienced persons, so a healthcare professional is often required to distinguish between the two.|$|R

5|$|Smythe married Irene Sands on March 17, 1920, at Central Methodist Church. The couple {{lived in}} an {{apartment}} on St. Clair Avenue, then moved to the Runnymede area of Toronto {{to be close to}} Smythe's sand and gravel business, which operated a gravel pit north-west of Jane Street and St. Clair. (Smythe Park exists on the site today). In 1927, after their first two children, Stafford and Miriam, were born, they moved to the Baby Point enclave of Toronto, where they would live {{for the rest of their}} lives. Irene and Smythe had two other children, Hugh and Patricia. Hugh became a doctor; a specialist in rheumatology, and later a director of Maple Leaf Gardens. Patricia died due to <b>an</b> <b>allergic</b> attack at the age of ten, in 1945. Stafford became involved in the Smythe sand and gravel business and Maple Leaf Gardens before dying of complications from a bleeding ulcer in 1971. Stafford's son Thomas was a stick boy with the Maple Leafs and later was involved with the Toronto Marlboros and Doug Laurie Sporting Goods at Maple Leaf Gardens, before becoming director of the Smythe Charitable Foundation after Conn's death.|$|E
5|$|The green-head ant {{possesses}} a highly potent sting {{that can be}} painful but is short-lived. An icepack or commercially available spray {{can be used to}} relieve the pain, but individuals experiencing <b>an</b> <b>allergic</b> reaction are normally taken to the hospital for treatment. The venom is powerful enough to cause anaphylactic shock in sensitive humans. In a 2011 Australian ant allergy venom study, of which the objective was to determine what native Australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis, it was shown that 34 participants reacted to the venom of the green-head ant. The rest of the participants reacted to Myrmecia venom, in particular, 176 to M. pilosula alone. The study concluded that four main groups of Australian ants were responsible for causing anaphylaxis. The green-head ant was the only ant that was not a Myrmecia species to cause allergic reactions in participating individuals. Green-head ants have been reported causing mortality amongst poultry. Despite its potential danger to sensitive humans, green-head ants can be beneficial. They can serve as a form of pest control by killing agricultural pests such as beetle and moth larvae and termites.|$|E
5|$|The two-colored bolete is an edible mushroom, {{although}} some may have <b>an</b> <b>allergic</b> reaction after ingestion {{that results in}} stomach upset. The mushroom has a very mild to no taste although {{it is said to}} have a very distinctive taste like that of the king bolete. It can be cooked several ways, and the varying color of the cap can be used to determine if the mushroom is ready to be eaten. If the cap is a lighter red, then it is less mature and is in a stage where it is often larva infested or it can be soft fleshed, in some cases both. The cap should have a dark brick red color when safe to eat. Drying the two-colored bolete is a good method for storage. It is important to note the time it takes for the two-colored bolete to bruise when identifying it for consumption; the mushroom should take several minutes to bruise compared to the instant bruising of Boletus sensibilis, which is poisonous and has many of the same visual characteristics of the two-colored bolete.|$|E
50|$|Some {{common side}} effects such as drowsiness, dry mouth, and {{tiredness}} may occur. Meclizine {{has been shown}} to have fewer dry mouth side effects than the traditional treatment for motion sickness, transdermal scopolamine. <b>A</b> very serious <b>allergic</b> reaction to this drug is unlikely, but immediate medical attention should be sought if it occurs. Symptoms of <b>a</b> serious <b>allergic</b> reaction may include rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, and trouble breathing.|$|R

5|$|These {{non-human}} antibodies {{are recognized}} as foreign by the human immune system and may be rapidly cleared from the body, provoke <b>an</b> <b>allergic</b> reaction, or both. To avoid this, parts of the antibody can be replaced with human amino acid sequences, or pure human antibodies can be engineered. If the constant region is replaced with the human form, the antibody is termed chimeric and the substem used was -xi-. Part of the variable regions may also be substituted, in which case it is called humanized and -zu- was used; typically, everything is replaced except the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), the three loops of amino acid sequences at the outside of each variable region that bind to the target structure, although some other residues may have to remain non-human {{in order to achieve}} good binding. Partly chimeric and partly humanized antibodies used -xizu-. These three substems did not indicate the foreign species used for production. Thus, the human/mouse chimeric antibody basiliximab ends in -ximab just as does the human/macaque antibody gomiliximab. Purely human antibodies used -u-.|$|E
5|$|While {{the root}} of the parsnip is edible, {{handling}} the shoots and leaves of the plant requires caution as the sap is toxic. Like many other members of the family Apiaceae, the parsnip contains furanocoumarins as a defense against herbivory, photosensitive chemicals that causes a condition known as phytophotodermatitis. The condition is a type of chemical burn rather than <b>an</b> <b>allergic</b> reaction, and is similar to the rash caused by poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans). Symptoms include redness, burning, and blisters; afflicted areas can remain discolored for up to two years. Reports of gardeners experiencing toxic symptoms after coming into contact with foliage have been made but these have been small in number compared to {{the number of people who}} grow the crop. The problem is most likely to occur on a sunny day when gathering foliage or pulling up old plants that have gone to seed. The symptoms have mostly been mild to moderate.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies are glycoproteins {{belonging}} to the immunoglobulin superfamily. They constitute most of the gamma globulin fraction of the blood proteins. They are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains. There are several different types of antibody heavy chains that define the five different types of crystallisable fragments (Fc) that may {{be attached to the}} antigen-binding fragments. The five different types of Fc regions allow antibodies to be grouped into five isotypes. Each Fc region of a particular antibody isotype is able to bind to its specific Fc Receptor (except for IgD, which is essentially the BCR), thus allowing the antigen-antibody complex to mediate different roles depending on which FcR it binds. The ability of an antibody to bind to its corresponding FcR is further modulated by the structure of the glycan(s) present at conserved sites within its Fc region. The ability of antibodies to bind to FcRs helps to direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter. For example, IgE is responsible for <b>an</b> <b>allergic</b> response consisting of mast cell degranulation and histamine release. IgE's Fab paratope binds to allergic antigen, for example house dust mite particles, while its Fc region binds to Fc receptor ε. The allergen-IgE-FcRε interaction mediates allergic signal transduction to induce conditions such as asthma.|$|E
