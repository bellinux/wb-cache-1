40|$|A large {{move towards}} {{renewable}} energy generation is anticipated to inevitably {{take place in}} the coming decades as the world faces the depletion of fossil energy reserves. The trend in the current global scenario presents the potential of the <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> industry into becoming one of the major contributors for alternative energy generation. Since the number of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>generators</b> connected to a grid continuously increases, providing subtle attention on issues confronting this technology is vital. Weather condition significantly influences the performance of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>generators</b> and thus, the <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>generator</b> technology is vulnerable to generation uncertainties. Uncertainties in generated outputs are often relevant the outputs of traditional deterministic models, easily resulting in uneconomical and unreliable solutions. Thus, the accurate assessment of the potential location and size of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>generators</b> under the uncertainties of the element of wind speed is important. Improper allocations may further degrade the performance of an entire power system. The current study provides a review on the popular and distinct techniques developed by researchers to optimize <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> capacity and location and maximally harvest the targeted benefits from wind energy resources. Moreover, different techniques for predicting wind speed, particularly for long-term prediction, are discussed to show the correlation between wind speed prediction and the planning process for creating a <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>generator...</b>|$|R

40|$|Capítulos en librosThis paper {{analyzes}} the dynamic response of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>generators</b> {{in case of}} voltage dips. When a fault occurs in the network, a voltage dip {{is applied to the}} <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>generator</b> common coupling point. <b>Wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>generators</b> are equipped with minimum voltage protections that can trip the unit in case of a long voltage dip to protect both the machine and the <b>power</b> system. If <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>generators</b> are connected to the transmission network, a fault in it may result in voltage dip applied to many <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>generators.</b> A large amount of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> generation can be tripped if the dip is long enough, leading to system collapse. The capability of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>generators</b> to withstand voltage dips is a key feature of them since it is currently determining the maximum admissible <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> generation in systems with high wind penetration. The response of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>generators</b> to voltage dips depends on the technology of the electromechanical energy conversion device. Three technologies are mainly used and will be analyzed and compared in this paper: squirrel cage induction generators, doubly fed induction generators and multi-pole synchronous generators. The fundamental response of the generators will be obtained {{as the basis for the}} design of protection schemes. Despite their limitations, <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>generators</b> based on squirrel cage induction machines are widely used. A voltage dip results in a reduction of the electromagnetic torque and in a subsequent rotor acceleration. Depending on the voltage dip duration the machine may either come back to the original operating point or lose stability. During the fault and the deceleration process the machines consumes reactive current that it is limited by the transient reactance and the equivalent external impedance. Doubly fed induction generators are the most widespread electromechanical energy conversion devices in <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> generation due their speed regulating capability that allows them to operate in the optimal operating point of the wind turbine. In addition, the network side power electronic converter provides them continuous reactive power compensation capability. The response of doubly fed induction generators in case of voltage dips is limited by the overvoltages in the dc link and the overcurrents in the rotor converter. In addition, the doubly fed induction machine only consumes reactive power during the voltage dip. Dc link overvoltages and rotor converter currents can be reduced with a crowbar system connected to the machine rotor. <b>Wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>generators</b> based on multi-pole synchronous generators have the advantage that do not require a gear box. Multi-pole synchronous generators equipped with voltage source power electronic converters have speed regulating capability to be able to operate in the optimal operating point of the wind turbine. As in doubly fed induction generator, the network side power electronic converter provides them continuous reactive power compensation capability. The response of multipolesynchronous generators in case of voltage dips is limited by the overvoltages in the dc link. In addition, multipole synchronous generators do not draw reactive power during the voltage dip. Dc link overvoltages can be reduced connecting a crowbar system in the dc link. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
