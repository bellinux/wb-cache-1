500|$|Ted Shackelford, {{who plays}} Gary, {{described}} the love story, [...] "I can't complain. I mean, Gary spent {{six or seven}} years being led down the primrose path by one stupid broad after another. So with Val... You'd think after 13 years, at the age they are [...] and the amount of bullshit they've been through, they would have learned something! They'd probably have a very comfortable life by now. But it makes for a dead story line." [...] When asked about working with Van Ark, he said: [...] "I don't know how it could get any better. [...] She's remarkable, and I'm not blowing smoke up your ass. I'd tell you if I thought she was <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ass, although sometimes she is <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ass. But my best work is done with Joan." [...] Van Ark also discussed Valene's relationship with her daughter, Lucy Ewing. She said, [...] "The spine or the beginning of the series was Gary and Val, coming over from Dallas, so maybe there should have been more Lucy. I do know that CBS and the producers of both shows wanted to keep the two shows separate but in the beginning you had Larry Hagman and others going over to Knots." ...|$|E
500|$|Moore doubletracked his vocals, but {{apart from}} {{occasional}} use of delay did not use any effects on his vocals. He used an Elektron Monomachine and a Minimoog Voyager with computer software to produce the keyboard sounds on the album. Matheos detuned his guitars to C# and sometimes B instead of using a seven-string guitar because he prefers {{the sound of a}} detuned guitar: [...] "To me, they sound totally different if you have those nice loose, floppy strings," [...] he said. [...] "It's a real bitch to keep them in tune, stopping every couple measures, retuning and punching back in. Especially for [...] song that's in B, or even C# is a problem sometimes, especially if you're doing a lot of fast moving around or high up on the neck. It's <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ass, but I really like that sound. I don't think I would ever go to a 7-string." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1984, while {{promoting}} the film This Is Spinal Tap, Shearer, Christopher Guest and Michael McKean had a performance on Saturday Night Live. All three members were offered {{the chance to}} join to the show in the 1984–1985 season. Shearer accepted because he was treated well by the producers and he thought the backstage environment had improved but later stated that he [...] "didn't realize that guests are treated better than the regulars." [...] Guest also accepted the offer while McKean rejected it, although he would join the cast in 1994. Dick Ebersol, who replaced Lorne Michaels as the show's producer, said that Shearer was [...] "a gifted performer but <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> butt. He's just so demanding on the preciseness of things and he's very, very hard on the working people. He's just a nightmare-to-deal-with person." [...] In January 1985, Shearer left the show for good, partially because {{he felt he was}} not being used enough. Martin Short said Shearer [...] "wanted to be creative and Dick [...] wanted something else. [...] I think he felt his voice wasn't getting represented on the show. When he wouldn't get that chance, it made him very upset." ...|$|E

500|$|His {{character}} was branded a [...] "rat" [...] and [...] "dastardly" [...] for splitting up Gina and Emily by the Daily Record. Upon Darren's 2003 return to Hollyoaks, the Sunday Mercury {{said he had}} become [...] "even more of <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neck". They later called the character [...] "a really nasty piece of work" [...] and when he stole from his father, they questioned if Jack would [...] "see what he's really like". Inside Soaps Peter Griffiths referred to Darren {{as one of the}} serial's [...] "reliable stalwarts", saying it was a [...] "relief" [...] when he appeared and added that Darren was one of the characters who can [...] "be relied upon to deliver". He added that the [...] "tried-and-tested" [...] characters helped the show through its rough patches and that they should be given the storylines they deserved. Griffiths' colleague Sarah maintained that Darren was {{the only part of the}} show that held her interest. The Press and Journal described Darren's time on the soap, saying: [...] "He languished in prison for helping his father fake his own death, has battled a crippling gambling addiction and has been known to steal people's girlfriends and break up relationships".|$|E
500|$|Writing for HitFix, Alan Sepinwall cited [...] "Holidays of Future Passed" [...] as {{the best}} future-set episode of The Simpsons since the first one, [...] "Lisa's Wedding". He noted that it was [...] "the {{emotional}} side of things" [...] that made the episode successful, such as the dissatisfaction Bart and Lisa feel because of their disconnection with the children, and also Homer's transformation into a [...] "very wise, sweet guy after somehow surviving into old age." [...] Sepinwall particularly praised {{the scene at the}} cryonics facility where Homer encourages the children to give Bart another chance as [...] "really sweet", and he described the idea of a frozen Grampa as [...] "a clever variation on the very familiar joke of how Homer and the family neglect [...] because he's such <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ass." [...] Sepinwall also commended the episode for its jokes about the future, highlighting the scenes revolving around air travel as well as the scenes showing Krusty as [...] "the Andy Rooney of 2041" [...] and Ralph Wiggum as [...] "an endless series of stupid clones who keep killing one another." [...] In February 2012, [...] "Holidays of Future Passed" [...] was listed by Matt Zoller Seitz of New York magazine as one of [...] "Nine Latter-Day Simpsons Episodes That Match Up to the Early Classics". He noted that the [...] "reconciliations between Bart and Lisa and their kids are moving." ...|$|E

2500|$|Leng {{describes}} Harrison's {{performance on}} guitar as [...] "Dylanish upmarket busking" [...] {{in the style}} of [...] "Miss O'Dell". In addition to playing 12-string acoustic guitar and singing, Harrison overdubbed a part on jew's harp, an instrument that was among his many contributions to Splinter's debut album, The Place I Love. Authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter view the song as an obvious [...] "one-take affair", with Harrison's half-heartedness apparent in his [...] "barely in-tune" [...] guitar and the underlying message that [...] " [...] this B-side is <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ass".|$|E
2500|$|La Torre {{wrote the}} lyrics to [...] "Don't Look Back", {{predominantly}} basing them on a poem about moving on, which he wrote many years prior when he was [...] "in a really weird place personally". He explains that the song is about [...] "taking charge of [...] own life and not making up excuses for why life is such <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ass sometime," [...] because La Torre believes that we control our own destiny, and are responsible for our own successes and failures. He has also said: [...] "It's about scenarios of despair, but people are finding the beauty in the very simple things in life." [...] Looking for [...] "some kind of resolver or conclusion" [...] to make the lyrics make sense, {{he came up with}} a chant: [...] "Magnetize what you conceptualize because your thoughts become things", a thought process based on the law of attraction from the book The Secret. The chant is repeated three times {{near the end of the}} song; La Torre says [...] "it used to build up even more" [...] in the original demo.|$|E

2500|$|The Stooge films {{made between}} 1935 and 1941 {{captured}} {{the team at}} their peak, according to film historians Ted Okuda and Edward Watz, authors of The Columbia Comedy Shorts. Nearly every film produced became a classic in its own right. Hoi Polloi (1935) adapted the premise of Pygmalion, with a stuffy professor making a bet that he can transform the uncultured trio into refined gentlemen; the plotline worked so well that it was reused twice, as Half-Wits Holiday (1947) and Pies and Guys (1958). Three Little Beers (1935) featured the Stooges running amok {{on a golf course}} to win prize money. Disorder in the Court (1936) features the team as star witnesses in a murder trial. Violent is the Word for Curly (1938) was a quality Chase-directed short that featured the musical interlude [...] "Swingin' the Alphabet". In A Plumbing We Will Go (1940)—one of the team's quintessential comedies—the Stooges are cast as plumbers who nearly destroy a socialite's mansion, causing water to exit every appliance in the home. Other entries of the era are considered among the team's finest work, including Uncivil Warriors (1935), <b>A</b> <b>Pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pullman (1936), False Alarms (also 1936), Grips, Grunts and Groans (1937), The Sitter Downers (also 1937), Dizzy Doctors (also 1937), Tassels in the Air (1938), We Want Our Mummy (1939), Nutty but Nice (1940), An Ache in Every Stake (1941) and In the Sweet Pie and Pie (also 1941).|$|E
2500|$|He {{is listed}} as Vice President at Algae Systems, a Nevada-based company with a working demo-scale pilot plant in Daphne, Alabama, {{dedicated}} to commercializing novel methods at the water-energy nexus for growing microalgae offshore as a second-generation biofuels feedstock and converting it to useful crude via hydrothermal liquefaction, while simultaneously treating wastewater, reducing carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere, and producing biochar. At Startup Grind Jackson Hole on March 13, 2015, Barlow {{said that he was}} motivated to team up with Algae Systems after undergoing back surgery to address pain from an old ranching injury, while he had been an advisor to Herb Allison (president of Merrill Lynch at the time) and working to completely [...] "electronify" [...] financial transactions and speculative asset assembly (Barlow was named [...] "One of the 25 Most Influential People in Financial Services" [...] in the June 1999 issue of FutureBanker Magazine). The surgery successfully alleviated the pain and catalyzed Barlow to change his focus from building wealth to building infrastructure in order {{to do something about the}} “amount of alterations we are already enacting on Planet Earth... We are not necessarily making it warmer, but weirder.” At Startup Grind Jackson Hole, Barlow also explained how once over tea with “Grandmother of the Conservation Movement” Mardy Murie, he was inspired by her words, “Environmentalists can be <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ass... But they make great ancestors.” Adopting this philosophy, Barlow says, “I want to be a good ancestor." ...|$|E
