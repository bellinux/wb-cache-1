40|$|With the {{increasing}} occurrence of antimicrobial resistance, more {{attention has been}} directed towards surveillance of both human and veterinary antimicrobial use. Since the early 2000 s, several research papers on Danish pig antimicrobial usage have been published, {{based on data from}} the Danish Veterinary Medicines Statistics Program (VetStat). VetStat was established in 2000, as a national database containing detailed information on purchases of veterinary medicine. This paper presents a critical set of challenges originating from static system features, which researchers must address when estimating antimicrobial exposure in Danish pig herds. Most challenges presented are followed by at least one robust solution. A set of challenges requiring awareness from the researcher, but for which no immediate solution was available, were also presented. The selection of challenges and solutions was based on a consensus by a cross-institutional group of researchers working in projects using VetStat data. No quantitative data quality evaluations were performed, as the frequency of errors and inconsistencies in a dataset will vary, depending on the period covered in the data. Instead, this paper focuses on clarifying how VetStat data may be translated to an estimation of the antimicrobial exposure at herd level, by suggesting uniform methods of extracting and editing data, in order to obtain reliable and comparable estimates on pig antimicrobial consumption for research purposes.

40|$|BACKGROUND Intraocular {{pressure}} (IOP) {{is the key}} modifiable {{risk factor}} in glaucoma, a major public health problem, if undiagnosed can ultimately lead to irreversible blindness. The role of blood pressure (BP) in genesis of increased IOP has attracted attention besides being a modifiable problem. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES To find out the correlation between blood pressure and intraocular pressure in a population of central Kerala and to assess the age and gender related changes in IOP. METHODS A cross sectional {{study was conducted in}} apparently healthy 487 patients aged between 20 - 80 years who attended Ophthalmology Outpatient Department at Kottayam Medical College. Blood Pressure was measured using sphygmomanometer in the right arm in sitting posture after 5 minutes of rest and IOP was measured using Schiotz tonometer. RESULTS Positive correlation between BP (Systolic and diastolic BP) and IOP was obtained. The correlation was statistically highly significant in males of all age groups except 41 - 60 age group and females of all age groups except 20 - 40 years. (p value< 0. 05). Rise in IOP with age was statistically significant in males. There was no statistically significant difference in mean IOP values of males and females. Systolic and diastolic BP increased with age in both genders and found to be statistically significant. CONCLUSION The study showed a positive correlation of SBP, DBP and IOP in both males and females. Hence, a routine evaluation of BP and IOP in outpatient departments becomes essential in this pretext and a population based screening for elevated IOP and BP could reduce the risk of glaucoma and hypertension in future by controlling elevated IOP and pre-hypertensives. <b>ABBREVIATION</b> <b>LIST</b> IOP - Intraocular Pressure, SBP - Systolic Blood Pressure; DBP - Diastolic Blood Pressure...|$|E

The {{subject of}} this thesis is the Ruthenian family of the Shipica representing the upper gentry group of lords and their Kuna estate in Eastern Podolia (Bratslavshchyna). So far both the area itself, as well as, the Ruthenian nobility did not attract much scholarly attention, mainly due to the opinion that source material was scarce. The main goal of this thesis is to discuss, based on new sources, {{the history of the}} Bratslav area from the late medieval period until the mid- 17 *’’ century focusing primarily on the Ruthenian lord group. Due to the source material, mainly of judicial character, the thesis is divided into two parts. The first one discusses the nature of the sources used, secondary literature and legal issues. A brief introduction to the area and its social and political history is given focusing on the Shipicas and their engagement in political, military and public activities, as they took part in many of the important events in the Bratslav territory. Special attention is also paid to the Tartar and Cossack factor in the developments of both the area and the Shipica family. The second part focuses primarily on the family and its estate. It examines the way the Shipicas acquired their first endowments, how they enlarged their estates, and their struggles to maintain their inheritance. Finally the efforts of the direct successors to keep the estate’s integrity and their loss of a large part of inherited lands, is examined. This part also endeavours to reconstruct the range of economic activities of the Slupica estate.

40|$|A new {{protease}} (RHAPN) was purified {{from the}} culture broth of Rhizopus hangchow IFO 4749 by sequential fast protein liquid chromatography procedures. The RHAPN had a molecular weight of about 34 kDa and was active at acidic pH without {{the presence of}} divalent metal ion. The inhibition profile and partial peptides sequence indicated that RHAPN might belong to the fungal secreted aspartic protease (SAP) family. The DNA fragment containing part of RHAPN gene was amplified by PCR using degenerate primers designed from the N-terminal peptides sequence and the conserve region of fungal SAPs. This DNA fragment encoded a polypeptide of 296 amino acids and was homologous with rhizopuspepsin III precursor from R. niveus. An efficient method for the preparation of R. oryzae protoplasts was established by using four lytic enzymes in combination, and a shuttle vector containing the A. oryzae ptrA gene as selectable marker was also constructed. 天門冬安酸胜肽分解酵素 (aspartic protease) 為一種蛋白水解酶，被廣泛的應用於食品工業。本研究由商業化生產之 Peptidase R 中純化得到一種蛋白水解酶，命名為RHAPN。經由其部分胜肽序列及其酵素特性分析，發現此酵素屬於真菌胞外天門冬安酸胜肽分解酵素家族 (secreted aspartic protease family, SAP) 之一員。利用 RHAPN 之 N 端序列及真菌 SAPs 之高度保留區設計成退化性引子，可自 Peptidase R 之生產菌 Rhizopus hangchow IFO 4749 基因組中選殖出一段約 1 kb 之DNA片段。將預測之內涵子 (intron) 自此序列中去除後，所得到之DNA片段可轉錄出具 296 個氨基酸之胜肽，此胜肽與已發表之 R. nivies rhizopuspepsin III 有 67 % 之相同度。經由軟體分析後發現，此基因可能為目前所發現之 Rhizopus spp. SAPs 之祖先。在建立真菌基因表現平台系統方面，目前發現 pyrithiamine 可抑制 R. oryzae 之生長，並已將 pyrithiamine resistant gene (ptrA) 構築入穿梭載體 pskGA 中。此外，本實驗亦成功利用 Novozyme 234 、yatalase、chitinase 及 chitosanase 建立 R. oryzae 原生質體之製備方法。Contents 中文摘要 Abstract Page of Figures Page of Tables <b>Abbreviation</b> <b>list</b> Chapter 1 Introduction 1. 1 Proteases 1. 1. 1 Biological functions of proteases 1. 1. 2 Industrial applications of proteases 1. 1. 3 Classification of proteases 1. 1. 4 Aspartic proteases 1. 2 Rhizopus spp. 1. 2. 1 Aspartic proteases of Rhizopus spp. 1. 2. 2 Transformation system of R. oryzae 1. 3 Purpose and strategies Chapter 2 Materials and methods 2. 1 Chemicals 2. 2 Strains and media 2. 3 DNA and RNA manipulation 2. 3. 1 General methods 2. 3. 2 Isolation of genomic DNA and total RNAs from Rhizopus spp. 2. 3. 3 PCR and RT-PCR 2. 4 Protein purification 2. 4. 1 Purification of aspartic protease from Peptidase R 2. 4. 2 Enzyme digestion of the aspartic protease 2. 5 Enzymatic assay 2. 5. 1 Aspartic protease 2. 5. 2 Leucine aminopeptidase 2. 6 Cloning of RHAPN gene from R. hangchow 2. 6. 1 DNA probe for RHAPN gene 2. 6. 2 Partial genomic library of R. hangchow 2. 6. 3 Colony hybridization 2. 7 Transformation system for R. oryzae 2. 7. 1 Construction of the E. coli-R. oryzae shuttle vector 2. 7. 2 Preparation of R. oryzae protoplast 2. 7. 3 Transformation of R. oryzae Chapter 3 Results 3. 1 Purification of aspartic proteases from Peptidase R 3. 2 Characterization of the aspartic protease from Peptidase R 3. 2. 1 MALDI-TOF and LC-MSMS analysis 3. 2. 2 Effect of pH and temperature 3. 2. 3 Effect of inhibitor and metal Ions 3. 2. 4 Self-digestion of RHAPN 3. 2. 5 Partial peptide sequences 3. 3 Cloning of the aspartic protease genes from Rhizopus spp. 3. 4 Transformation system for R. oryzae Chapter 4 Discussion 4. 1 RHAPN from R. hangchow 4. 2 Self-digestion of RHAPN 4. 3 Transformation system for R. oryzae 4. 4 Conclusion Chapter 5 Reference...|$|E
40|$|Medication {{errors are}} an {{unnecessary}} threat to patient safety. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the epidemiology of medication errors and to assess the effectiveness of interventions intended to avoid medication errors in a tertiary-care hospital in Hong Kong. The epidemiology of medication errors included the study of the pattern of interception of medication errors and the study of technology-related medication errors using medication incidents reported during years 2006 – 2010. 34. 1 % of all medication errors that were reported in the study hospital were not intercepted and 92. 4 % of all drug administration errors reached the patient. 17. 1 % of all reported medication errors were technology-related and, most were due to human interaction with technology. The effects of a bar-code assisted medication administration (BCMA) system when used without the support of computerised prescribing (stand-alone), on its users and the dispensing process was studied using direct observations, questionnaires (Likert scale) and interviews. It was found that this system increased the number of dispensing steps from 5 to 8 and dispensing time by 1. 9 times. Potential dispensing errors also increased (P< 0. 001). The perceived usefulness of the technology decreased among pharmacy staff (P= 0. 008) after implementation and they (N= 16) felt that the system offered less benefit to the dispensing process (8 / 16) without the support of computerised prescribing. Nurses (N= 10) felt that the stand-alone BCMA system was useful in improving the accuracy of drug administration (8 / 10). Avoiding the use of inappropriate abbreviations in prescriptions will help to reduce medication errors. Therefore the effectiveness of a ‘Do Not Use’ list (a list of error-prone abbreviations used in the study hospital) and attitudes of health care professionals on using abbreviations in prescriptions was studied using prescription review and questionnaires respectively. The use of abbreviations included in the ‘Do Not Use’ list decreased significantly (P< 0. 001) after its introduction but other unapproved abbreviations to denote drug names and instructions were commonly used. 96 % of doctors, and all pharmacists and nurses, believed that avoiding inappropriate abbreviations will help to reduce medication errors. The use of abbreviations in prescriptions and attitudes of pharmacists in the study hospital was compared with a different medical system to determine the appropriateness of developing a universal error-prone <b>abbreviation</b> <b>list.</b> It was found that the types and frequencies of using inappropriate abbreviations vary among different medical systems. In conclusion, additional interventions such as technological interventions are needed to minimise drug administration errors, but proper planning and careful monitoring are needed to avoid unintended errors when using technologies. Implementing a stand-alone BCMA system aimed at reducing drug administration errors may affect the dispensing process. Therefore effects of a technology on all related processes need to be considered before implementation, and monitored after implementation. The introduction of a ‘Do Not Use’ list is effective in reducing inappropriate abbreviations in prescriptions and most health care professionals agree that avoiding inappropriate abbreviations may help to reduce medication errors. However, formulating in-house error-prone and standard abbreviation lists in hospitals, continuous updating of the lists and frequent reminders to prescribers are recommended. published_or_final_versionMedicineDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|MR allows {{non-invasive}} {{means of}} evaluating the non-mineralized components of bone, particularly the bone marrow. This thesis focuses on potential changes occurring in bone marrow perfusion and marrow fat in osteoporosis, - changes which may improve {{our understanding of}} osteoporosis pathophysiology. We know from histology studies that as osteoporosis develops and bone tissue is lost, it is replaced by fat filling the vacated marrow space. MR allows non-invasive quantification of this fat component. Although fat content may be increasing, {{it is not known}} whether any change in fat composition occurs with osteoporosis i. e. does the type of fat within bone change. Epidemiological studies have indicated a link between arterial disease and osteoporosis. It is not known, however, whether any changes occur in bone perfusion in osteoporosis and how these may be related to increasing fat within the marrow. The hypothesis to be tested is that: Advanced magnetic resonance (MR) techniques can be applied to investigate the non-mineralised components of bone tissue in osteoporosis thereby providing more information on bone physiology both in health and diseaseThis thesis is based on a series of eight studies designed to study the relationship between bone marrow perfusion, bone marrow fat content, bone marrow fat composition and bone mineral density. These studies showed that as bone mineral density decreased, bone marrow perfusion decreased. A strong reciprocal relationship was found between decreasing bone marrow perfusion and increasing marrow fat. The reduction in perfusion occurred only with bone and did not affect the extra-osseous tissues alongside bone with the same arterial supply. This indicates that the reduction in bone perfusion is not simply a reflection of a more generalized circulatory impairment in subjects with osteoporosis. This same effect is seen in both males and females and in the proximal femora as well as the spine. In animal-based studies, we found that reduction in bone perfusion was apparent as little as two weeks after orchidectomy or oorphorectomy and closely paralleled features of impaired endothelial function as well as decreased bone mineral density and a hitherto unrecognized reduction in red marrow fraction within the medullary canal. Nitric oxide synthase, produced by the endothelium, is a potent stimulator of angiogenesis and osteoblastic activity. Mesenchymal stem cell differentiation may switch from osteoblastogenesis to adipocytogenesis under hypoxic conditions, while haematopoetic stem cells also supply endothelial stem cells. Potentially endothelial dysfunction, mesenchymal stem cell differentiation and haematopoetic stem cell maturation may be implemented in the development of osteoporosis. In normal subjects, blood perfusion was markedly reduced in the femoral head compared to the femoral neck. In osteoporotic subjects, a further reduction in blood perfusion occurred in both areas. Overall perfusion indices reduced relatively more in the femoral neck than the femoral head region. These changes in bone perfusion help explain why subjects with osteoporosis have impaired healing of femoral neck fractures though {{do not seem to be}} at increased risk of avascular necrosis. At a micro-architectural level, reduced bone perfusion may also help explain the impaired healing of microfractures seen in subjects with osteoporosis, a feature likely to contribute to reduce bone strength, microfracture accumulation and eventually clinical insufficiency fracture. Marrow fat was increased in subjects with osteoporosis. Our studies showed that percentage marrow fat content increased even allowing for the quantitative effect increased marrow fat has on the bone densitometry measurements. This effect was shown to be of negligible clinical significance. We found a strong reciprocal relationship between increasing fat and decreasing bone perfusion in both the proximal femur and vertebral body. Although fat content increased, very little difference in marrow fat composition was apparent between normal subjects and those with osteoporosis. We found no difference was apparent in either the N 3 /N 6 marrow fat ratio or the spectrum of individual fatty acids in the marrow of subjects with either normal bone mineral density or osteoporosis. This suggests that alternation of marrow fat composition is not likely to be a direct contributory factor in osteoporosis. Also marrow fat increase was shown to be due to an increase in number rather than size of marrow fat cells. This suggests that marrow fat increases as a result of a switch in mesenchymal cell maturation to adipocytes rather than osteoblasts. Below average perfusion indices in the acetabulum and adductor muscle is predictive of more pronounced bone loss at the femoral neck over the ensuing four years. Perfusion indices can also predict between fast and slow losers with a high sensitivityTo summarise, in the eight studies presented, it was shown that osteoporosis is associated with a significant reduction in bone perfusion and a reciprocal increase in marrow fat content though no change in marrow fat composition. Reduction in bone perfusion is most likely due to an accompanying reduction in functioning marrow fraction. Marrow fat increase is most likely the result of a switch in mesenchymal cell maturation to adipocytes rather than osteoblasts. The studies present in this thesis confirmed the initial hypothesis that “Advanced magnetic resonance techniques can be applied to investigate the non-mineralised components of bone tissue in osteoporosis thereby providing more information on bone physiology both in health and disease.

40|$|T 1 D is an {{autoimmune}} disease {{characterized by a}} selective destruction of the insulin-producing ß-cells in the pancreas. We used 2 D-DIG E as proteomic platform to elucidate the effects at the protein level of ß-cell death inducing agents. One of the biases of every proteomic research is the inability to study the complete proteome at the same time, due to its inherent bewilderingl y complex nature. By creating a reference map (chapter 4) of the INS- 1 E cells, we sought to gain insight {{in the proportion of}} the proteome readi ly accessible to us by 2 D-GE. We identified 592 spots on the gel, and cl assified the proteins according to function and subcellular localization. This reference map will serve as a starting point and guide for future proteomic analyses in diabetes-related research. Future quantitative ap proaches under different experimental conditions will hopefully provide new insights in the mechanisms involved in altered ß-cell func tion and viability associated with diabetes development. ß-cell destruction is partially mediated through cytokines secreted by immune cells causing activation of ER stress and pro-apoptotic pathw ays. We sought for the mechanisms involved in ß-cell destructi on and the changes evoked at the protein level. We analyzed the effect o f the cytokines IL- 1 ß and IFN-&# 947; on ß-cell apoptosis and proteome. We firstly (chapter 5) studied the effect on the insulin-p roducing INS- 1 E cells, a rat model cell line for ß-cells. The individual cytokines did not generate profound effects on apoptosis indu ction in this cell line. We mainly identified proteins with a protective or anti-apoptotic role in INS- 1 E cells treated with IFN-&# 947; alone. W hen we considered the effects of IL- 1 ß alone, the proteome changes in the INS- 1 E cells were indicative of imbalanced cell functionality. Th e combination of IL- 1 ß and IFN-&# 947; elicited profound cellular ch anges, translated in a high rate of apoptosis induction and numerous pro teins affected. Different cellular mechanisms were affected by the cytok ine treatment. Metabolism, as observed through differential expressed en zymes involved in the Krebs cycle and glycolysis, was impaired, as well as cytoskeleton formation. Chaperones, necessary for proper protein fold ing, were inactivated or downregulated. The proteins responsible for sta bilization of insulin mRNA and proper processing of the insulin protein displayed a decreased expression, as was the case for proteins with prot ective roles in ROS quenching. Bioinformatical network analysis demonstr ated a close interconnectivity of these diverse effects. In a follow-up study (chapter 6), we used mouse islets deficient in two important members of the IFN-&# 947; signaling pathway. Disruption of the signaling pathway at the level of STAT- 1 completely prevented cytokine- induced apoptosis, while disruption more downstream, at the level of IRF - 1, was responsible for a partial protection. Wild-type mouse islets sho wed a similar response at the protein level as compared to INS- 1 E cells. Mouse islets deficient in STAT- 1 or IRF- 1 displayed an alteration in th eir proteome in concordance with their reduced sensitivity for cytokine- induced apoptosis. Proteins with a protective effect which were downregu lated in wild-type mouse islets did not display such a regulation in the disrupted mouse islets. Moreover, the PTM and inactivation of GRP 78, an important chaperone in ß-cells, as observed in INS- 1 E cells a nd wild-type mouse islets, did not occur in the disrupted mouse islets. We identified a protein, namely GRP 75, whose function in the ß -cell and expression profile in the different mouse strains could explai n the differences observed in sensitivity to cytokine-induced cell death in STAT- 1 -/- and IRF- 1 -/- mouse islets. Taken together, we identified t he proteins which were STAT- 1 or IRF- 1 dependent and had a role in the p rotection of the islets against cytokine-induced apoptosis. With these s tudies, we were able to validate and complement previous research on cyt okine-induced apoptosis in ß-cells, one of the mechanisms invo lved in T 1 D. We identified the proteomic profile of a ß-cell g oing into apoptosis by cytokines, and proposed some proteins with possib le key roles in the road to ß-cell apoptosis or survival. We c hose not only to further focus on the important JAK/STAT pathway for&nbs p;ß-cell death upon cytokine challenge, but also a more mechanistic level was investigated. IL- 1 ß and IFN-&# 947; cause ß-cel l apoptosis partially through ER stress. We used the reversible ER stres sor CPA in order to elucidate the changes at the protein level this ER s tressor generates. Low levels of ER stress were insufficient to trigger apoptosis, but we detected at the proteome level the picture of an imbal anced cell, with the inherent profile of a cell destined to go into apop tosis. At later time points however, this proteomic profile reversed and apoptosis was averted. Key proteins for this reversal were identified (14 - 3 - 3 proteins and the modification status of GRP 78). At elevated level s of ER stress, still not toxic to other cell types, INS- 1 E cells demons trated a high rate of apoptosis. We identified the changes imposed on th e proteome using a high dose of CPA. Proteins responsible for cell metab olism, cytoskeleton, protein synthesis and RNA synthesis are all downreg ulated with no recovery at a later time point. <b>Abbreviation</b> <b>list</b>					VII 1.

40|$|Periodontitis is a {{frequently}} encountered {{infectious disease}} that affects about 80 % of the adults. Approximately 10 to 15 % of these adults {{suffer from a}} severe form, in which the accompanied inflammatory process {{will result in the}} destruction of the supporting tissues of the teeth. When left untreated, periodontitis can lead to loosening and subsequent loss of teeth. Periodontitis {{is considered to be a}} polymicrobial infection. The mouth is very densely populated with a complex microbiota forming community biofilms on the tooth surface called dental plaque. It is this biofilm that can give rise to periodontitis, however in contrast with early theories other factors also contribute to the onset of disease. The current view on the aetiology of the periodontal diseases considers three factors to be crucial in disease development: a susceptible host (and environment), the presence of pathogenic species and reduction or absence of beneficial bacteria. According to this theory the oral cavity and its microbiota are regarded as an oral ecosystem that is in equilibrium with the host and the environment under healthy conditions, however a change in one of the three aforementioned factors could lead to periodontal disease. Conventional treatment for periodontitis is still based on older theories since one tries to remove the whole bacterial threat by mechanical subgingival debridement and leaves the subsequent recolonization up to chance. This protocol does not always succeed in arresting and controlling periodontitis. Additionally the increase in resistance towards antimicrobial agents warrants the development of new treatments. The recognition that this therapy also removes the beneficial part of the microbiota may result in new treatment options focusing on protecting or restoring this beneficial microbiota. The search for alternative treatment options was the main aim of this research by modulating the oral microbiota. In a first study described in the manuscript a closer look was given to the microbial shift that occurs when going from a healthy situation to periodontitis. Past research on this topic has always been conducted on a relatively small study population, the innovative aspect of this study was that data from more than 6000 untreated patients was analysed to investigate the microbiological shifts as function of disease severity and to correlate the outgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, associated with periodontitis, with suppression of beneficial bacteria. Digging deeper into the bacterial relations and interactions that occur when going from health to disease can be very useful as in that way it will allow us to predict shifts in the community species composition and thus changes from oral health towards oral disease. In the second part the quest for new treatment options was started focusing primarily on the balance between beneficial and pathogenic species in the oral environment. One option is to attack the Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria (periodontopathogens) present in periodontitis using biological agents. Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, is a small, very motile Gram-negative, delta Proteobacterium, that is able to predate, enter and kill other Gram-negative bacteria. As most periodontopathogens are Gram-negative bacteria, the use of B. bacteriovorus against those bacteria would be a possible treatment option. Previous tests with this predator were conducted on single species communities or single species biofilms and in this study the action of this predatory bacterium against Gram-negative bacteria in multispecies models was tested. In the third and fourth study the other side of the balance was considered: the number of beneficial species. One approach that can lead to a boost in beneficial bacteria is the use of pre- and probiotics. In the third chapter a systematic review of the literature on probiotics in the oral cavity was performed in order to get a better idea of the mechanisms of action of probiotics and their clinical effects on oral health and more specifically on periodontitis. The systematic review showed that in most studies concerning probiotics and periodontal diseases lactobacilli were the probiotics of choice. However, instead of using extra-oral probiotics it would be more logical to directly refill low concentrations of indigenous beneficial bacteria. These indigenous beneficial bacteria have some advantages over other probiotic bacteria. They are already incorporated in the oral ecosystem and biofilm structure in this way they dont have to compete for binding sites to remain viable in the mouth. Theoretically, prebiotics could enhance the growth of beneficial bacteria already present in the mouth. In the fourth chapter, the aim was to screen for and select potential prebiotics that specifically stimulate indigenous beneficial species in the oral environment and to assess whether this stimulation can cause a reduction of pathogenic bacteria. The last chapter was dedicated to the assessment of a new technique to distinguish between live and dead bacteria using ethidium monoazide (EMA) and propidium monoazide (PMA) in combination with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The existence of such technique is very useful in the dental field as for the moment DNA of both live and dead bacteria is quantified with qPCR. This makes it very difficult to establish whether a treatment protocol against periodontitis is effective, without using culturing techniques. The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of this technique on Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus mutans and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, three pathogenic bacteria implicated in different oral pathologies. This technique could form the base for all future research concerning periodontitis-associated bacteria and treatments.

40|$|Abstract Pilsner malt, one of {{the main}} {{ingredients}} for the production of beer, is made in a three-step production process which involves subsequent steeping, germination and kilning. Compared to pilsner malt, dark specialty malts are produced at higher temperatures. Depending on the applied drying procedure, dark specialty malts canbe further divided in colour, caramel and roasted malts. In that respect, colour malts are produced in a kiln at higher temperatures compared to pilsner malt, whereas caramel and roasted malts are manufactured in a roasting drum. The elevated temperatures applied during kilning and roasting intensify the non-enzymatic browning reactions, resulting in the formation of colour, flavour and antioxidant components. As the extent of these reactions is influenced by the reaction conditions, the presence and concentration of the previously mentioned compounds in dark specialtymalts depend on the applied processing parameters. When used for the production of beers, these malts can {{have a significant impact on}} the characteristics of the end product. In this research, the main objectives were to identify and characterise flavour components in different types of dark specialty malts and to elucidate the influence of the applied processing parameters on the development of flavour, colour and antioxidant power in caramel malts. Moreover, the evolution of dark specialtymalt flavour components during wort boiling and the influence of these malts on the flavour stability of beer was studied. First, headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography and massspectrometry was used to characterise the volatile fraction of aqueous extracts and dry ground samples of different colour, caramel and roastedmalts. Following this procedure, more than 100 compounds could be identified including oxygen-, nitrogen- and sulphur containing heterocyclic components. Since caramel-like furanones and pyranones could only be extracted out of a dry matrix, an extraction technique was optimised to determine these components in dry ground malts. These results revealed that the malt type, and as a consequence the production process, had an important influence on the presence of components. In that respect, caramel-like flavour components such as maltol and furaneol proved to be present in the highest concentrations in caramel malts, whereas greatest amountsof the roasted-like pyrazines were found in roasted malts. In addition,no clear relationship between the malt colour and the concentration of flavour components could be established. Besides flavour components, malt characteristics such as moisture content, extract content and pH also mainly depended on the type of dark specialty malt. The influence of the time and temperature of the roasting process on the development of malt characteristics was studied during the production of caramel malt. This process comprises an initial saccharification step and a subsequent caramelisation step. During the first phase, the optimal formationof the reducing sugars, glucose and maltose, and free amino acids was closely related to the optimal temperatures of activity of the involved enzymes. As expected, it became clear that the time and temperature of the latter phase had an important influence on the evolution of several malt characteristics such as the moisture content, extract, pH, colour andreducing power. The development of important flavour components was highly influenced by the roasting temperature and the moisture content of the malt kernels. Moreover, the obtained results indicated that flavour development was not linked to the colour formation. The use of darkspecialty malts in the grist proved to have a significant impact on thecolour and the presence of flavour components in the sweet wort. Boiling, however, resulted in an increase of the wort colour and the TBA value, which depended on the used dark specialty malt type. Although a part of the flavour components present in the sweet wort evaporated during boiling, pyrazines proved to be present in a considerable amount in the boiled wort. Branched- 2 -alkenals, however, evaporated almost completely outof the wort, whereas β-damascenone accumulated. If unaltered during fermentation, these components can possibly contribute to the global beer flavour. In a last chapter, the influence of dark specialty malts on the beer flavour stability was studied. On the one hand, these results indicated no significant difference in global appreciation betweenboth fresh beers. On the other hand, a cocoa, caramel flavour was ascribed to the fresh caramel malt beer, whereas marzipan, bread-like flavours characterised the colour malt beer. After thermally forced ageing, caramel and fruity flavours decreased, whereas cardboard and ribes notes increased. The analytical results showed that the concentration of severalknown staling markers increased during ageing. However, few of these components were likely to contribute to the global flavour due to their high flavour thresholds. In conclusion, this work provides new insights in the presence of flavour components in different types of dark specialty malts and the development of these compounds together with some important malt characteristics during the production process of caramel malts. Finally, a light was shed on the behaviour of dark specialty malts during the brewing process and their influence on the flavour stability of beer.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{universal}} data-driven tool for segmenting and tokenizing text. The presented tokenizer lets the user define where token and sentence boundaries should be considered. These instances are then judged by a classifier which is trained from provided tokenized data. The features {{passed to the}} classifier are also defined by the user making, e. g., the inclusion of <b>abbreviation</b> <b>lists</b> trivial. This level of customizability makes the tokenizer a versatile tool which we show is capable of sentence detection in English text as well as word segmentation in Chinese text. In the case of English sentence detection, the system outperforms previous methods. The software is available as an open-source project on GitHub 1. 1...|$|R
