5000|$|Passing over Hawaii at {{the final}} orbit, Kraft told Carpenter to begin his retrofire {{countdown}} and to shift from manual control to the <b>automatic</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>control.</b> Partly {{because he had been}} distracted watching the fireflies Carpenter noted that he had begun his landing preparations late. As he started to align the spacecraft he found that the automatic stabilization system would not hold the required 34-degree pitch and zero-degree yaw attitude. While trying to determine the source of the trouble, he fell behind in his check of other items. When he hurriedly switched to the fly-by-wire control mode, he forgot to switch off the manual system. As a result, both systems were used redundantly together for 10 minutes, and fuel was wasted.|$|E
50|$|On April 24, 1967, {{the single}} pilot of Soyuz 1, Vladimir Komarov, {{became the first}} {{in-flight}} spaceflight fatality. The mission was planned to be a three-day test, to include the first Soviet docking with an unpiloted Soyuz 2, but the mission was plagued with problems. Early on, Komarov's craft lacked sufficient electrical power because only one of two solar panels had deployed. Then the <b>automatic</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> system began malfunctioning and eventually failed completely, resulting in the craft spinning wildly. Komarov was able to stop the spin with the manual system, which was only partially effective. The flight controllers aborted his mission after only one day. During the emergency re-entry, a fault in the landing parachute system caused the primary chute to fail, and the reserve chute became tangled with the drogue chute; Komarov was killed on impact. Fixing the spacecraft faults caused an eighteen-month delay before piloted Soyuz flights could resume.|$|E

This scenario was experienced recently during Shuttle mission STS- 117 and ISS Stage 13 A in June 2007 when the Russian GN&C computers, which command the ISS thrusters, failed. Without <b>automatic</b> propulsive <b>attitude</b> <b>control,</b> the ISS {{would not be able}} to regain <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> after the Orbiter undocked. The core {{issues associated}} with recovering long-term <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> using CMGs are described as well as the systems engineering analysis to identify recovery options. It is shown that the recovery method can be separated into a procedure for rate damping to a safe harbor gravity gradient stable orientation and a capability to maneuver the vehicle to the necessary initial conditions for long term attitude hold. A manual control option using Soyuz and Progress vehicle thrusters is investigated for rate damping and maneuvers. The issues with implementing such an option are presented and the key issue of closed-loop stability is addressed. A new non-propulsive alternative to thruster control, Zero Propellant Maneuver (ZPM) <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> method is introduced and its rate damping and maneuver performance evaluated. It is shown that ZPM can meet the tight attitude and rate error tolerances needed for long term <b>attitude</b> <b>control.</b> A combination of manual thruster rate damping to a safe harbor attitude followed by a ZPM to Stage long term <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> orientation was selected by the Anomaly Resolution Team as the alternate <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> method for such a contingency...|$|R

The robustness of the affective priming effect across many different procedural variations, the mediating mechanisms thought to underlie the effect, and the moderating role of associative strength are discussed.

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of spacecraft <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> using magnetic actuators only {{is low and}} {{on the order of}} 0. 4 - 5 degrees.

In this paper novel <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> algorithms using the combination of magnetic actuators with Reaction Wheel Assembles (RWAs) or other types of actuators, such as thrusters, are presented. The combination of magnetic actuators with one or two RWAs aligned with different body axis expands the two-dimensional control torque to three-dimensional. The algorithms can guarantee the spacecraft attitude and rates to track the commanded attitude precisely. A design example is presented for Nadir pointing, pitch and yaw maneuvers.
