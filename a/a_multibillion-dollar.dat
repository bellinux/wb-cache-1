5|$|Gatorade, {{now owned}} by PepsiCo, is today sold in some eighty {{countries}} and over fifty various flavors.

5|$|Another one of Bowerman's pupils, Phil Knight, {{partnered with}} Bowerman and {{revolutionized}} the sport with {{the formation of}} the shoe company giant, Nike. Knight graduated from the University of Oregon in 1959 and went on to Stanford University for graduate school. There, he developed the idea to import Japanese running shoes to the American market. After earning his MBA from Stanford, he returned to the University of Oregon where he and Bowerman struck a handshake deal in 1964, each with a $500 investment into a company called Blue Ribbon Sports to import Japanese running shoes. In the late 1960s, Bowerman's pursuit of lighter shoes for his athletes led him to develop a sole by pouring rubber into his wife's waffle iron, inventing the modern running shoe. After Knight decided to rename the company Nike and develop its own shoes, Bowerman's invention became the prototype for the company. The shoe made its debut in the 1972 Olympic Trials at Hayward Field with Steve Prefontaine as one of the early endorsers. Although Bowerman retired from coaching in 1972, he remained on Nike's board until 1999. In that time, Nike exploded into <b>a</b> <b>multibillion-dollar</b> company.|$|E

5|$|Thousands {{of plant}} species are {{cultivated}} for aesthetic purposes {{as well as}} to provide shade, modify temperatures, reduce wind, abate noise, provide privacy, and prevent soil erosion.

While some gardens are planted with food crops, many are planted for aesthetic, ornamental, or conservation purposes. Arboretums and botanical gardens are public collections of living plants. In private outdoor gardens, lawn grasses, shade trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, vines, herbaceous perennials and bedding plants are used.
