5|$|Pesticides {{are applied}} to crops by <b>agricultural</b> <b>aircraft,</b> tractor-mounted crop {{sprayers}} or as seed dressings to control pests. However, successful control by pesticides is not easy; the right formulation must be chosen, the timing is often critical, the method of application is important, adequate coverage and retention on the crop are necessary. The killing of natural enemies of the target pest should be minimised. This is particularly important in countries where there are natural reservoirs of pests and their enemies in the countryside surrounding plantation crops, and these co-exist in a delicate balance. Often in less-developed countries, the crops are well adapted to the local situation and no pesticides are needed. Where progressive farmers are using fertilisers to grow improved crop varieties, these are often more susceptible to pest damage, but the indiscriminate application of pesticides may be detrimental in the longer term.|$|E

25|$|In 1953, Britten-Norman {{was formed}} {{for the purpose}} of {{converting}} and operating <b>agricultural</b> <b>aircraft,</b> amongst other vehicles such as the Cushioncraft hovercraft. In 1963, the firm initiated development work upon what would become the Islander, having sensed a demand for a single and inexpensive twin-piston engine aircraft. The founders, John Britten and Desmond Norman, had observed the rapid growth of the commuter airline sector, and concluded that capacity was of a higher value to these operators than either range or cruising speed, thus the Islander emphasized payload over either of these attributes.|$|E
25|$|During 1953 Fred Weick was {{approached}} by Piper to become a consultant on the agricultural version of the PA-18 the PA-18A, in particular to design and test a distributor for dust and seeds. A few weeks later Piper sponsored Texas A University to design a dedicated <b>agricultural</b> <b>aircraft</b> based on the AG-1 but to use as many PA-18A and PA-22 components as possible, the resulting design the AG-3 was smaller than the AG-1 and had a steel tube fuselage and was fabric covered. The AG-3 was a single-seat low-wing monoplane with the wings braced to the fuselage with struts, it had a conventional landing gear with a tailwheel and was powered by a 135hp engine. The single seat was placed high in the fuselage to give the best visibility and an 800lb-capacity hopper was fitted {{in front of the}} cockpit.|$|E
25|$|The PZL-126 Mrówka (ant) is a Polish <b>agricultural</b> <b>aircraft</b> first {{flown in}} 1990. It is a {{diminutive}} low-wing monoplane of conventional if stubby appearance with a T-tail, an enclosed cabin and fixed, tricycle undercarriage. Significant {{parts of the}} design were undertaken by students at the training college attached to the PZL plant at Okęcie {{under the direction of}} Andrzej Słocinski, with the whole project treated initially as a platform for design innovation. Initial design work was completed in 1982 and detail work the following year. Plans to fly a prototype by 1985 were delayed by revisions to the aircraft's equipment, although a mockup was displayed at an agricultural aviation exhibition at Olsztyn that August. Legislation to outlaw certain agricultural chemicals was under consideration in Poland in the late 1980s, spurring interest in biological agents as an alternative and making a tiny aircraft like the Mrówka feasible as a useful piece of agricultural equipment.|$|E

500|$|A {{blockade}} of the JNA facilities {{in and around}} Varaždin was ordered on 13 September 1991, which took effect {{the next day when}} utilities and access to the barracks were cut. In response, the Corps command informed Croatian forces that they could no longer guarantee peace unless utilities were restored and JNA military vehicles were allowed to move freely. On 15 September, the Corps began preparing for the demolition of all minor military facilities which could not be defended. At the same time, negotiations began between the Corps command and civilian authorities in Varaždin. At 15:30, the Yugoslav Air Force attacked the Varaždin Airfield. The strike was intended to disrupt flights of Antonov An-2 <b>agricultural</b> <b>aircraft</b> converted to carry [...] of cargo—transporting weapons from the Hungarian town of Nagykanizsa. The attacking force comprised two planes sortied from Željava Air Base, which broke the sound barrier above Varaždin to produce a sonic boom and bombed the airfield. One bomb destroyed an An-2 on the ground and damaged the runway, while the second landed in a nearby field.|$|E
