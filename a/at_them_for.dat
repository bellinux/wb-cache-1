500|$|Six Feet Under Episode 16, of Season 2, [...] "The Plan", {{featured}} a seminar-delivery organization called [...] "The Plan", which the character Claire Fisher immediately compared to est. [...] Actress Alice Krige portrays [...] "Alma" [...] the seminar leader of [...] "The Plan" [...] - who uses jargon {{related to the}} [...] "blueprint" [...] for building a house in order to convey concepts about self-improvement. [...] She singles out the character Ruth and berates her for [...] "tiptoeing around her own house like she's afraid of waking someone up." [...] Ruth begins to use jargon from the course in her conversations with family, and complains to her daughter that she cannot yet go to sleep after coming home from her seminar because she must first do [...] "homework" [...] from the course. This homework includes writing a letter to her dead mother forgiving her for [...] "all the terrible things she did to me", and writing a letter to herself, describing how she will [...] "renovate" [...] her life. [...] During the following day of [...] "The Plan", the seminar leader gives the group a new assignment: to go outside to ready banks of phones, and call their family members to inform them of specifically how they wish to [...] "renovate their homes" [...] together. [...] In the seminar, the leader asks everyone to close their eyes and imagine that everyone else is laughing <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> being stupid, and then asks the participants if they get the joke. Everyone does, except Ruth, who rants at the course instructor. After her rant, the leader congratulates her for [...] "knocking down her old house", and proceeds {{to tell her that}} now she can rebuild a new house.|$|E

2500|$|NPC AI is {{determined}} {{primarily by the}} [...] "Fear/trust system". The trust system determines whether the NPCs will follow Blake's orders and join him in combat. To do so, the player must ensure the NPC trusts Blake, and does not suspect him of being a Thing. NPCs have four levels of trust; red, amber, green and 100%. Red means they are convinced Blake is a Thing and will attack him. Amber means they are {{not sure if he}} is a Thing, and although they won't attack him, they won't follow his orders. Green means they trust him and will follow his orders. 100% means they have complete faith in him, will follow his orders, and even if he attacks another NPC, they will support him. To gain the trust of NPCs, Blake can give them weapons and ammo, heal them, put himself at risk to protect them, or use a blood test kit on himself to prove he is not a Thing. Actions which deplete trust include accidentally shooting teammates, taking away teammate's weapons or ammo, or pointing a weapon <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> a sustained period of time to force them to do something.|$|E
2500|$|The Offspring {{has been}} labeled under {{multiple}} genres, such as punk rock, pop punk, skate punk, and alternative rock. A signature {{style of the}} Offspring are their chorused [...] "whoas", [...] "heys", or [...] "yeahs". NOFX (who were labelmates with the Offspring from the early to mid-1990s) poked fun <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> this in their song [...] "Whoa on the Whoas". Several tracks also incorporate elements of Eastern music, which can be heard on the likes of [...] "Pay the Man" [...] and the verse hook from [...] "Come Out and Play". Their lyrics cover {{a wide range of}} topics, like personal relationships, such as in their songs [...] "She's Got Issues", [...] "Self Esteem" [...] and [...] "Spare Me the Details", and the degradation of the United States, politics, and society in general with songs like [...] "It'll Be a Long Time", [...] "Americana" [...] and [...] "Stuff Is Messed Up". The lyrics generally reflect a sarcastic viewpoint, which, along with the language, can be offensive to some. This is acknowledged in the opening track from their album Ixnay on the Hombre, [...] "Disclaimer", which is sarcastic itself. Like [...] "Disclaimer", the first track of most of the Offspring's albums are an introduction of some sort, [...] "Time to Relax" [...] (from Smash), [...] "Welcome" [...] (from Americana), [...] "Intro" [...] (from Conspiracy of One), and [...] "Neocon" [...] (from Splinter) are also examples of this.|$|E

2500|$|In the post-match press conference, Anil Kumble {{summed up}} {{his view of}} the game by stating, [...] "Only one team is playing {{in the spirit of the}} game" [...] – a {{statement}} that alluded to Australian captain Bill Woodfull's leaked private admonishment of English manager Sir Pelham Warner during the 1932–33 Bodyline series. Chetan Chauhan, India's team manager said his players were [...] "agitated and upset by... the incompetent umpires here... that they will not officiate again in the series". Ponting was questioned over the wrong decision, the racism row, and especially the wicket of Ganguly during which he held his finger up to indicate to Mark Benson that Ganguly has been caught. Ponting was aggressive towards the Indian journalists, lashing out <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> [...] "questioning my [...] integrity". The Australian players faced much questioning as a result of the fallout of the incident. The Australian team maintained that they play hard but fair. In regards to the racism issue, Ponting denied he did anything wrong by singularly reporting Harbhajan Singh for being abusive. Ponting stated that he was obligated to refer any incidents of racism to officials as it is widely agreed that racism is unacceptable anywhere in the world. After criticism of the Australian team in multiple media continued, a shocked Ponting promised to ensure that his side's conduct is not seen to be arrogant in future matches. Peter Roebuck, a columnist in The Sydney Morning Herald, branded Ponting as [...] "arrogant" [...] and insisted that be stripped of the captaincy.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{critics have}} been less kind however, arguing that if the later plays show a skilled and {{confident}} writer exploring serious issues of the human heart, Two Gentlemen represents the initial, primarily unsuccessful attempt to do likewise. In 1921, for example, J. Dover Wilson and Arthur Quiller-Couch, in their edition of the play for the Cambridge Shakespeare, famously stated that after hearing Valentine offer Silvia to Proteus [...] "one's impulse, upon this declaration, is to remark that there are, by this time, no gentlemen in Verona." [...] H.B. Charlton, writing in 1938, argues that [...] "clearly, Shakespeare's first attempt to make romantic comedy had only succeeded {{so far as it}} had unexpectedly and inadvertently made romance comic." [...] Another such argument is provided by Norman Sanders in 1968; [...] "because the play reveals a relatively unsure dramatist and many effects managed with a tiro's lack of expertise, it offers us an opportunity to see more clearly {{than anywhere else in the}} canon what were to become characteristic techniques. It stands as an 'anatomie' or show-through version, as it were, of Shakespeare's comic art." [...] Kurt Schlueter, on the other hand, argues that critics have been too harsh on the play precisely because the later plays are so much superior. He suggests that when looking at Shakespeare's earlier works, scholars put too much emphasis on how they fail to measure up to the later works, rather than looking <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> their own intrinsic merits; [...] "we should not continue the practice of holding his later achievements against him when dealing with his early beginnings." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{they were}} going below, Francisco Portusach sailed across {{the bow of the}} Charleston in a {{whaleboat}} with the American flag at the topmast. A loud voice from the ship called, [...] "Frank, come on board." [...] Portusach looked up to the deck and saw Captain Hallett, a man whom he had known years before. The skipper of the whaleboat then went to the lee side of the cruiser and clambered aboard. When he reached the deck, he was surprised to find a reporter with whom he was acquainted, a representative of the San Francisco Chronicle. While the reporter and the old whaling captain were talking about old times, Lieutenant William Braunersreuther, the navigator, walked up to Portusach and demanded to know by what right he was hoisting the American flag at the topmast of the little boat. The Guam merchant merely grinned and replied the flag was being flown legally. The lieutenant promptly requested proof, and Portusach produced American naturalization papers from an inside coat pocket and handed them to the doubting Braunersreuther who looked at them and said, [...] "Well! Twenty-second of October, 1888, Chicago, Cook County, State of Illinois." [...] The navigator examined the document more thoroughly and requested Portusach to accompany him to visit Glass. The [...] "welcoming party" [...] had just departed for shore, so the two men entered the captain's cabin, and the lieutenant handed the naturalization papers to Glass who looked <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> a few moments. He had already heard from José Portusach that Francisco possessed some lighters and boats, so he greeted the merchant by inquiring if it was possible to obtain the use of two lighters and a boat to transfer coal from the City of Peking to the bunkers of the Charleston and offered to pay for the service. Portusach agreed to furnish the boats without compensation since he felt an obligation, as the only United States citizen on the island, to aid his country in time of war.|$|E
