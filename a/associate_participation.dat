40|$|The {{environmental}} movement {{is no longer}} a ‘new’ movement and what passed as ‘new’ and unconventional forms of action have waned, increasingly displaced by cyber campaigns and conventional lobbying of governments by {{environmental movement}} organisations. Examination of the social and political backgrounds of Australian environmental group members shows that members of protest-oriented environmental groups tend to be leftwing and younger than average. However, those who play active roles in environmental groups are not young and are far less likely to join protest groups. While young Australians are more environmentally aware than ever before, they may <b>associate</b> <b>participation</b> in environmental groups beyond monetary donations and virtual activism with the behaviour of their protest-oriented parents and grandparents...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{subjective}} understanding of participation {{and integration of}} persons with spinal cord injuries from 5 European countries and to compare these findings with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) ’s conceptualization of participation. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with 54 persons with acquired spinal cord injuries and 3 with spina bifida from 5 countries were examined using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Integration was most often associated with social acceptance and, furthermore, with ordinary performance, equality and freedom of choice. Participation was most often described as ordinary performance, with less emphasis on social acceptance and equality. However, participation and integration overlapped in people’s narratives and were difficult to separate. The perception of participation and integration was largely similar across countries. In contrast to others, however, Finnish interviewees {{were more likely to}} <b>associate</b> <b>participation</b> with contributing to society. A variety of life domains was identified, of which recreation and leisure, work life, sports and going out were the most prevalent. CONCLUSION: While participation domains are well covered by the ICF, as is the notion of ordinary performance, interviewees also referred to a rights (e. g. acceptance) and duties (e. g. contribution) perspective...|$|E

40|$|Issue addressed: Workplaces are {{promising}} settings for health promotion, yet employee participation in workplace health promotion (WHP) activities is often low or variable. This study explored facilitating factors and barriers <b>associated</b> with <b>participation</b> in WHP activities that formed {{part of a}} comprehensive WHP initiative run within the Tasmanian State Service (TSS) between 2009 and 2013. Methods: TSS employee (n = 3228) completed surveys in 2013. Data included sociodemographic characteristics, employee-perceived availability of WHP activities, employee-reported participation in WHP activities, and facilitators and barriers to participation. Ordinal log-link regression was used in cross-sectional analyses. Results: Significant associations were found for all facilitating factors and participation. Respondents who felt their organisation placed a high priority on WHP, who believed that management supported participation or that the activities could improve their health were more likely to participate. Time- and health-related barriers were <b>associated</b> with <b>participation</b> in fewer activities. All associations were independent of age, sex, work schedule and employee-perceived availability of programs. Part-time and shift-work patterns, and location of activities were additionally identified barriers. Conclusion: Facilitating factors relating to implementation, peer and environmental support, were <b>associated</b> with <b>participation</b> in more types of activities, time- and health-related barriers were <b>associated</b> with less <b>participation.</b> So what?: Large and diverse organisations should ensure WHP efforts have manager support and adopt flexible approaches to maximise employee engagement...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Objectives: Motives for {{participating}} in {{a specific type of}} physical activity (PA) may differ across PA type in youth. We studied the relationship between PA motives and type of PA engaged in by youth. Design: Cross-sectional analysis using data from the Monitoring Activities of Teenagers to Comprehend their Habits (MATCH) study. Method: 802 students age 10 - 11 years from 17 primary schools in New-Brunswick, Canada completed a questionnaire that collected data on type of PA participated in (individual, group-based, organized, non-organized), PA motives (enjoyment, social affiliation, competence, fitness/health, appearance) and attainment of PA guidelines (60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA per day). The associations between PA motives and PA type and between PA motives and attainment of PA recommendations were assessed in multilevel logistic regression models. Results: Endorsing enjoyment motives was <b>associated</b> with <b>participation</b> in organized PA (Odds Ratio, 95 % Confidence Interval: 1. 54, 1. 24 - 1. 91). Competence motives were <b>associated</b> with <b>participation</b> in group-based PA (1. 27, 1. 11 - 1. 46) and achievement of PA recommendations (1. 95, 1. 37 - 2. 78).

40|$|This paper empirically {{decomposes}} {{the costs}} <b>associated</b> with <b>participation</b> in welfare {{by developing a}} structural model of labor supply and multiple program participation {{to better understand the}} barriers of participation in social insurance programs. The well-documented fact that many individuals who are eligible for welfare choose not to participate implies that there is a sizable cost <b>associated</b> with <b>participation,</b> but {{little is known about the}} composition of this cost. Prior estimates have not differentiated psychological costs of participation, or “stigma, ” from the time and effort required to become eligible and maintain eligibility (time costs). However, the relative size of these two costs has implications for welfare reform. Applying our model to data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation, 1996 (SIPP 96), we find that psychological costs are substantially larger than the time costs <b>associated</b> with <b>participation</b> and we find that psychological costs increase with educational attainment and are lower for women of a minority race. To determine whether the psychological cost of participation borne at the individual-level reduces social welfare by a commensurate amount, this paper considers a model in which psychological costs may discourage the use of government assistance as a substitute for work in the context of asymmetric information about an individual’s ability. We estimate a negative correlation between the preference for leisure and psychological costs, which suggests that the incidence of psychological costs is inconsistent with these costs acting as an effective screening mechanism...|$|R

40|$|We propose {{and test}} a {{framework}} of the antecedents of contribution in two technology-mediated citizen science projects, with different degrees of task granularity. Comparing earlier findings on the motivations of volunteers in a web-based image analysis project (high granularity), with new findings on the motivations of volunteers in a volunteer computing project (low granularity), we found that participation task granularity is correlated with motivation levels. Further, we found that collective and intrinsic motives are the most salient motivational factors, whereas reward motives are less important for volunteers. Intrinsic, norm-oriented and reputation-seeking motives were most strongly <b>associated</b> with <b>participation</b> intentions, which were, in turn, <b>associated</b> with <b>participation.</b> Finally, comparing the relationship between motives and participation among the two volunteer populations, we found that active-participation volunteers are characterized by significantly stronger association between collective motives and contribution intention, whereas passiveparticipation volunteers are characterized by significantly stronger association between identification with the community and contribution intention.

40|$|Introduction Textbooks {{matter for}} an {{inclusive}} education. I examined {{the way in}} which 30 textbooks in history, religion, civics, and biology represent disability-related issues. Aim: The overall aim is to find out if textbooks represent the type of disability in association with age, ethnicity, and participation. Specifically, this research addresses the question: Are textbooks’ representations of the type of disability, age, and ethnicity <b>associated</b> with <b>participation?</b> By participation I refer to whether textbooks represent people with disabilities as (a) engaged in daily activities located outside of institutionalized residence. Engagement in activities may be indicated by sports, being a wage earner, voting, protesting, spending time with family or friends or (b) only being at their institutionalized residence/flat. Methods: I examined three hypotheses regarding representations of type of disability, ethnicity, and age and how these are <b>associated</b> with <b>participation.</b> I analysed the data using a combination of qualitative coding of the content as well as qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). Results: Although most textbooks do mention disability, people with a disability remain largely invisible, and {{less than half of the}} textbooks represent people with disabilities as active participants. Conclusions: First, I demonstrate that physical disability is <b>associated</b> with active <b>participation.</b> Second, I demonstrate that disability is associated with ethnic majority. Third, I demonstrate that the participation of people with disabilities is associated with both young and old age groups...|$|R
40|$|We {{sought to}} examine whether {{neighborhood}} deprivation is <b>associated</b> with <b>participation</b> in a large population-based health check. Such analyses will help answer the question whether health checks, which are {{designed to meet the}} needs of residents in deprived neighborhoods, may increase participation and prove to be more effective in preventing disease. In Europe, no study has previously looked at the association between neighborhood deprivation and participation in a population-based health check. The study population comprised 12, 768 persons invited for a health check including screening for ischemic heart disease and lifestyle counseling. The study population was randomly drawn from a population of 179, 097 persons living in 73 neighborhoods in Denmark. Data on neighborhood deprivation (percentage with basic education, with low income and not in work) and individual socioeconomic position were retrieved from national administrative registers. Multilevel regression analyses with log links and binary distributions were conducted to obtain relative risks, intraclass correlation coefficients and proportional change in variance. Large differences between neighborhoods existed in both deprivation levels and neighborhood health check participation rate (mean 53 %; range 35 - 84 %). In multilevel analyses adjusted for age and sex, higher levels of all three indicators of neighborhood deprivation and a deprivation score were <b>associated</b> with lower <b>participation</b> in a dose-response fashion. Persons living in the most deprived neighborhoods had up to 37 % decreased probability of participating compared to those living in the least deprived neighborhoods. Inclusion of individual socioeconomic position in the model attenuated the neighborhood deprivation coefficients, but all except for income deprivation remained statistically significant. Neighborhood deprivation was <b>associated</b> with <b>participation</b> in a population-based health check in a dose-response manner, in which increasing neighborhood deprivation was <b>associated</b> with decreasing <b>participation.</b> This suggests the need to develop preventive health checks tailored to deprived neighborhoods...|$|R
