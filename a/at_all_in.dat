5|$|A pupil {{like myself}} had {{to submit to}} Balakirev a {{proposed}} composition in its embryo, say, even the first four or eight bars. Balakirev would immediately make corrections, indicating how to recast such an embryo; he would criticize it, would praise and extol the first two bars, but would censure the next two, ridicule them, and try {{hard to make the}} author disgusted with them. Vivacity of composition and fertility were not <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> favor, frequent recasting was demanded, and the composition was extended {{over a long period of}} time under the cold control of self-criticism.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Yale Law School, Clinton {{returned}} to Arkansas {{and became a}} law professor at the University of Arkansas. In 1974, he ran for the House of Representatives. Running in a conservative district against incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt, Clinton's campaign was bolstered by the anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from the Watergate scandal. Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52percent to 48percent margin. In 1976, Clinton ran for Arkansas Attorney General. With only minor opposition in the primary and no opposition <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> the general election, Clinton was elected.|$|E

5|$|Cloth {{manufactured}} in England increasingly dominated European markets during the 15th and early 16th centuries. England exported almost no cloth <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> 1347, but by 1400 around 40,000 cloths a year were being exported – the trade reached its first peak in 1447 when exports reached 60,000. Trade fell slightly during the serious {{depression of the}} mid-15th century, but picked up again and reached 130,000 cloths a year by the 1540s. The centres of weaving in England shifted westwards towards the Stour Valley, the West Riding, the Cotswolds and Exeter, away from the former weaving centres in York, Coventry and Norwich.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though most}} ethnic groups prefer to {{communicate}} in their own languages, English as the official language is widely used for education, business transactions and for official purposes.

5|$|Gravitationally induced {{irregularities}} in Uranus's observed orbit led eventually {{to the discovery}} of Neptune in 1846, and presumed {{irregularities in}} Neptune's orbit subsequently led to a search which did not find the perturbing object (it was later found to be a mathematical artefact caused by an overestimation of Neptune's mass) but did find Pluto in 1930. Initially believed to be roughly the mass of the Earth, observation gradually shrank Pluto's estimated mass until it was revealed to be a mere five hundredth as large; far too small to have influenced Neptune's orbit <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>In</b> 1989, Voyager 2 determined the irregularities to be due to an overestimation of Neptune's mass.|$|E
