5|$|At {{therapeutic}} doses, amphetamine causes {{emotional and}} cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. It induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. Larger doses of amphetamine may impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown. Drug <b>addiction</b> <b>is</b> a serious risk with large recreational doses but {{is unlikely to}} arise from typical long-term medical use at therapeutic doses. Very high doses can result in psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia) which rarely occurs at therapeutic doses even during long-term use. Recreational doses are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses and carry a far greater risk of serious side effects.|$|E
5|$|Research in {{the field}} of {{addiction}} medicine has also recently turned its focus to LTP, owing to the hypothesis that drug addiction represents a powerful form of learning and memory. <b>Addiction</b> <b>is</b> a complex neurobehavioral phenomenon involving various parts of the brain, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Studies have demonstrated that VTA and NAc synapses are capable of undergoing LTP and that this LTP may be responsible for the behaviors that characterize addiction.|$|E
5|$|The {{new edition}} of the Tiger Woods PGA Tour series of video games {{incorporates}} elements of the alleged physical altercations Woods had with his wife regarding his extramarital affairs, and resembles a fighting game more than a golf simulation. Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny become big fans of the game. Meanwhile, scientists at the Center for Disease Control determine that sex <b>addiction</b> <b>is</b> a disease reaching epidemic proportions. They decide to screen schoolchildren for the disease, and Kenny, Kyle, and Butters are diagnosed as sex addicts. Kenny is killed after attempting autoerotic asphyxiation while in a Batman suit, while Kyle and Butters are sent to attend a therapy session for sex addicts consisting of Michael Douglas, Michael Jordan, Ben Roethlisberger, David Duchovny, Charlie Sheen, David Letterman, Bill Clinton, Billy Bob Thornton, Kobe Bryant, Eliot Spitzer, and Tiger Woods.|$|E

After Cuddy makes a bet to prove House's addiction to Vicodin, House concedes to Wilson {{that he has}} an addiction but says that the <b>addiction</b> <b>is</b> not a problem. It is, in fact, Wilson who usually writes House's Vicodin prescriptions (with Cuddy writing a few merely for leverage in her dealings with House). In Season 3, when Detective Michael Tritter (David Morse) threatens to jail House for his Vicodin addiction after finding a huge stash in his apartment, Wilson {{attempts to}} convince House to go to rehab as the situation worsens. After Tritter pressures Wilson to testify several times, Wilson reluctantly agrees, unknown to House. Before this, Wilson watches House punch Dr. Robert Chase, insult Cuddy, and incorrectly diagnose {{a child with a}} condition that would have required the amputation of her left arm and leg.|$|E
5|$|Adderall is {{generally}} well-tolerated and effective in treating {{the symptoms of}} ADHD and narcolepsy. At therapeutic doses, Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. At these doses, it induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. In contrast, much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control, cause rapid muscle breakdown, or induce a psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia). The side effects of Adderall vary widely among individuals, but most commonly include insomnia, dry mouth, and loss of appetite. The risk of developing an <b>addiction</b> <b>is</b> insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily doses, such as those used for treating ADHD; however, the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction due to the pronounced reinforcing effects that are present at higher doses. Recreational doses of Adderall are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses, and carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects.|$|E
25|$|It {{is worth}} noting that nicotine, {{although}} frequently implicated in producing tobacco <b>addiction,</b> <b>is</b> not significantly addictive when administered alone.

40|$|Social {{networking}} {{sites have}} started {{to become one of}} the most frequently used online communication types in the world. It is reported that one of the commonly used social networking sites is Facebook. Since Facebook use is new yet, it can be stated that researches on the Facebook <b>addiction</b> <b>are</b> at the beginning level. For this reason, determining factors leading to the Facebook addiction has gained importance. In this context, in this study, relationships between attachment styles and the Facebook <b>addiction</b> <b>were</b> examined. The participants of the study were 322 university students [145 (45 %) male, 177 (55 %) female, Mage= 20. 61 years, SD= 1. 82]. In the study, the Personal Information Form, the Relationship Scales Questionnaire and the Facebook <b>Addiction</b> Scale <b>were</b> administered. The relationships between attachment styles and the Facebook <b>addiction</b> <b>were</b> calculated via using the Pearson correlation analysis. The Pearson correlation analysis results indicated that the Facebook <b>addiction</b> <b>was</b> negatively related with the secure and dismissing attachment style and positively related with the preoccupied attachment style. No relationship was found between the fearful attachment style and the Facebook addiction. If the attachment styles predicted the Facebook <b>addiction</b> <b>was</b> examined via using the stepwise regression analysis. The research findings indicated that the secure and dismissing attachment style negatively predicted and the preoccupied attachment style positively predicted the Facebook <b>addiction.</b> However, it <b>was</b> determined that the fearful attachment style did not predict Facebook addiction. The research findings were discussed under the light of related literature...|$|R

25|$|Pain is {{typically}} treated with opioids, varying in potency {{based on the}} severity of symptoms. When opioids are used for prolonged periods, drug tolerance, chemical dependency, and addiction may occur. Opiate <b>addiction</b> <b>is</b> not typically a concern since the condition {{is not likely to}} ever completely disappear. Thus, lifelong treatment with opioids is fairly common for chronic pain symptoms, accompanied by periodic titration that is typical of any long-term opioid regimen.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol <b>addiction</b> <b>is</b> {{a complex}} disease {{that results from}} a variety of genetic, social, and {{environmental}} influences. Alcoholism affected approximately 4.65 percent of the U.S. population in 2001-2002, producing severe economic, social, and medical ramifications (Grant 2004). Researchers estimate that between 50 and 60 percent of alcoholism risk is determined by genetics (Goldman and Bergen 1998; McGue 1999).This strong genetic component has sparked numerous linkage and association studies investigating the roles of chromosomal regions and genetic variants in determining alcoholism susceptibility.|$|E

25|$|There are a {{range of}} genetic and {{environmental}} risk factors for developing an addiction that vary across the population. Roughly half of an individual's risk for developing an <b>addiction</b> <b>is</b> derived from genetics, while the other half {{is derived from the}} environment. However, even in individuals with a relatively low genetic loading, exposure to sufficiently high doses of an addictive drug {{for a long period of}} time (e.g., weeks–months) can result in an addiction. In other words, anyone can become an addict under the right circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepine {{dependence}} or benzodiazepine <b>addiction</b> <b>is</b> {{when one}} has developed {{one or more}} of either tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, drug seeking behaviors, such as continued use despite harmful effects, and maladaptive pattern of substance use, according to the DSM-IV. In the case of benzodiazepine dependence, however, the continued use seems {{to be associated with the}} avoidance of unpleasant withdrawal reaction rather than from the pleasurable effects of the drug. Benzodiazepine dependence develops with long-term use, even at low therapeutic doses, without the described dependence behavior.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines can be {{addictive}} and induce dependence even at low doses, with 23% becoming addicted within 3 {{months of}} use. Benzodiazepine <b>addiction</b> <b>is</b> considered {{a public health}} problem. Approximately 68.5% of prescriptions of benzodiazepines originate from local health centers, with psychiatry and general hospitals accounting for 10% each. A survey of general practitioners reported {{that the reason for}} initiating benzodiazepines was due to an empathy for the patients suffering and a lack of other therapeutic options rather than patients demanding them. However, long-term use was more commonly at the insistence of the patient, it is presumed, because physical dependence or addiction had developed.|$|E

25|$|Overall, {{the data}} implicating {{specific}} {{genes in the}} development of drug <b>addiction</b> <b>is</b> mixed for most genes. One reason for this may be that the case is due to a focus of current research on common variants. Many addiction studies focus on common variants with an allele frequency of greater than 5% in the general population, however when associated with disease, these only confer a small amount of additional risk with an odds ratio of 1.1–1.3 percent. On the other hand, the rare variant hypothesis states that genes with low frequencies in the population (<1%) confer much greater additional risk {{in the development of}} disease.|$|E
25|$|This <b>Addiction</b> <b>is</b> {{the seventh}} studio album by the punk rock band Alkaline Trio, {{released}} February 23, 2010 {{as the first}} release by their newly formed record label Heart & Skull, {{a joint venture with}} Epitaph Records. Described as a return to the band's punk rock roots, it was recorded at Atlas Studios in their hometown of Chicago with Matt Allison, the same location and producer used for much of their early material. The album draws lyrical inspiration from the band members' personal lives, addressing themes such as love, addiction, death, divorce, grief, suicide, politics, and war. It became the highest-charting album of the band's career, debuting on the Billboard 200 at #11 and also reaching #1 on the Rock, Independent, and Alternative Albums charts.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between negative affect {{and substance use}} disorders {{has been the most}} widely studied model of addiction. It proposes that individuals who experience the greatest levels of negative affect are at the greatest risk of using substances or behaviours as a coping (psychology) mechanism. Here, substances and behaviours are used to improve mood and distract from unpleasant feelings. Once physical dependence has been established, substance abuse is primarily motivated by a desire to avoid negative affective states associated with withdrawal. Individuals high in affective mood disorders (anxiety) most commonly report high levels of negative affect associated with cravings. The {{relationship between}} negative affect and <b>addiction</b> <b>is</b> not unidirectional. That is, while positive affect increases the likelihood of initiation of substance use, the negative affective states produced by withdrawal are the most commonly reported factors for continued use.|$|E
50|$|The German populace's {{experience}} {{during and after}} the First World War inspired the Weimar and Nazi governments to adopt an attitude of tolerance toward the use of drugs to relieve pain, increase performance, and avoid withdrawal. Most drugs were permitted either universally or for individuals with a medical prescription. Many of the drug addicts in 1920s and 1930s Germany were First World War veterans who required addictive drugs for pain relief and/or medical personnel who had access to such drugs. During the Weimar era, <b>addiction</b> <b>was</b> seen as a curable disease. Following the advent of Nazism, <b>addiction</b> continued to <b>be</b> viewed as curable for all, but members of disfavored ethnic or social groups. Among members of such groups, symptoms of drug <b>addiction</b> <b>were</b> often attributed to other conditions, which themselves were often pseudoscientifically diagnosed; even when <b>addiction</b> <b>was</b> recognized as such, Nazi physicians often viewed it as incurable in light of what they believed to be an inherent predisposition or weakness.|$|R
