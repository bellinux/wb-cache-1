25|$|Boric acid, or sassolite, {{is found}} mainly in its free state in some {{volcanic}} districts, for example, in the Italian region of Tuscany, the Lipari Islands and the US state of Nevada. In these volcanic settings it issues, mixed with steam, from fissures in the ground. It {{is also found}} as a constituent of many naturally occurring minerals – borax, boracite, ulexite (boronatrocalcite) and colemanite. Boric acid and its salts are found in seawater.

25|$|To {{accommodate}} the dive program and anglers, the Bikini Council built new air-conditioned rooms with private bathrooms and showers. They included verandas overlooking the lagoon. There was a dining facility that served American-style meals. The head chef Mios Maddison also prepared Marshallese dishes featuring fresh seafood. Only 12 visitors were hosted at one time. Because of the lingering contamination, <b>all</b> <b>fruits</b> and vegetables {{used for the}} Bikini Atoll dive and sport fishing operation were imported. In September 2007, the last of Air Marshall Islands' commuter aircraft ceased operations when spare parts could not be located and the aircraft were no longer airworthy. A half dozen divers and a journalist were stranded for a week on Bikini Island. The Bikini islanders suspended land-based dive operations beginning in August 2008.|$|E
25|$|Tithes are broken-off {{during the}} Sabbatical year (such {{as when the}} ground lies fallow), during which year, <b>all</b> <b>fruits,</b> grains and {{vegetables}} that are grown of themselves in that year are considered free and ownerless property. For example, whatever lands were held by those returning from the Babylonian exile {{at the time of}} Ezra are forbidden to be ploughed and sown by any Jew during the Seventh year, and even if gentiles were to plough such land and sow it, the produce would be forbidden unto Jews to eat. On the other hand, the extension of such lands held by the people of Israel who departed Egypt and who entered the Land of Canaan under their leader, Joshua, are forbidden to be ploughed by any Jew during the Seventh year, but if gentiles had ploughed such land and sown it, the produce is permitted to be eaten by a Jew. If on a regular week-year, fruits and grains and vegetables, if grown by an Israelite in these places, would require tithing.|$|E

25|$|Agriculture {{is a major}} {{industry}} in the United States, with California accounting for over 12% of the U.S. agriculture cash receipts. Over half of agricultural workers in California, contributing to the state's agriculture economy and providing the nation with over half of <b>all</b> <b>fruits</b> and vegetables, are undocumented. Despite undocumented laborers contributing to the agriculture industry, farm work and labor is among {{one of the lowest}} paid occupations in the U.S. Many undocumented communities suffer from food insecurity due to low wages, forcing families to purchase economically viable unhealthy food. Though existing food pantry and food stamp programs aid in reducing the amount of food insecure individuals, undocumented immigrants are ineligible for social service programs and studies have found that limited English acts as a barrier to food stamp program participation. Due to a lack of education, encounters with government agents, language barriers, undocumented individuals pose higher rates of food insecurity and hunger when compared to legal citizens. The Trump administration is attempting to draft new stricter immigration policies; undocumented individuals who fear being deported under the new policies, limit their interactions with government agencies, social service programs (e.g., food stamps), increasing their susceptibility to food insecurity.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{obligation}} {{that was}} incumbent upon an Israelite or Jew was {{to separate from}} his harvested grain (wheat, barley, spelt, etc.), wine (including unpressed grapes) and oil (including unpressed olives) the one-fiftieth portion of these products (or one-fortieth, {{if he were a}} man of generosity; and one-sixtieth if he were stingy) and to give the same to a man of Aaron's lineage (priestly stock), who, in turn, would eat such fruits in a state of ritual cleanness, in accordance with a biblical command, [...] "...and let him not eat of the holy things, until he bathes his flesh in water. And when the sun goes down down, he will be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things because it is his food" [...] (...) [...] This obligation was contingent upon the fact that such fruits grew in the Land of Israel. Later, the Rabbis made it an obligation {{to do the same for}} <b>all</b> <b>fruits</b> and vegetables grown in the Land of Israel, and not only to such fruits as grain, grapes and olives. With the destruction of the Temple and the cessation of ritual purity, the obligation to separate the Terumah continued unabated, although it was no longer given to a priest of Aaron's lineage, since bodily defilement was now pervasive. The general practice after the Temple's destruction was to separate the Terumah from <b>all</b> <b>fruits</b> and vegetables by removing even the slightest portion thereof, and to immediately discard it by burial or some other means of disposal (since it can no longer be eaten in the current state of ritual uncleanness, and those doing so would make themselves liable to extirpation).|$|E

General Richard Taylor, son of President Zachary Taylor, wrote {{a passage in}} his war memoirs about Jackson eating lemons: [...] "Where Jackson got his lemons 'no fellow could find out,' but he was rarely without one." [...] However, recent research by his biographer, James I. Robertson, Jr., has found that none of Jackson's contemporaries, including members of his staff, his friends, or his wife, recorded any unusual obsessions with lemons. Jackson thought of a lemon as a [...] "rare treat ... enjoyed greatly whenever it could {{be obtained from the}} enemy's camp". Jackson was fond of <b>all</b> <b>fruits,</b> particularly peaches, [...] "but he enjoyed with relish lemons, oranges, watermelons, apples, grapes, berries, or whatever was available." ...|$|E
2500|$|The narrator speaks at the game's ending, which varies {{based on}} the number of fruit the player {{retrieved}} during the game. If the player collects a minimum amount of fruit, the narrator states the explorers feel [...] "unease" [...] over the possibility the seeds collected will not be enough to save Koppai. If the player also collects a respectable amount of fruit, it is stated that careful planning will be required to save Koppai. If the player collects <b>all</b> <b>fruits,</b> the narrator states that the three have successfully completed their mission to restore life in Koppai and that the cause of the Drake's crash-landing is unknown and suggests that it may be on purpose. In a post-credits scene, the Pikmin see a flaming object falling into the surface of PNF-404. Depending on the game's ending, Alph's final log entry states that Louie is stranded on the planet.|$|E

6000|$|July 6th.--Mr. Cecil, {{the other}} day, {{was saying that}} England could produce as fine peaches as any other country.

[...] Just think of this idea of the richest, most luscious, of <b>all</b> <b>fruits!</b> But the untravelled Englishman has no more idea of what fruit is than of what sunshine is; he thinks he has tasted the first and felt the last, but they are both alike watery.

60|$|Hunger {{is also a}} most vehement thing; {{and that}} which is called 'hunger' in one place, is called 'desire' in another; and he desired 'to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table' (Luke 16:21; Psa 145:16). Exceeding lustings are called 'desires,' to show the vehemency of desires (Psa 106:14, 78:27-30). Longings, pantings, thirstings, prayers, &c., if there be any life in them, are <b>all</b> <b>fruits</b> of a desirous soul. Desires {{therefore}} flow from the consideration of the goodness, or profitableness, or pleasurableness of a thing; yea, all desires flow from thence; for a man desires not that about which he has had no consideration, nor that neither on which he has thought, if he doth not judge it will yield him something worth desiring.|$|E

60|$|In his {{security}} from having the affair in any wise on his hands, March would have willingly lingered, {{to see how}} her education got on; but it began to rain, The rain did not disturb the lovers, but it obliged the elderly spectators to take refuge in their carriage; and they drove off to find the famous Little Goose Man. This is what every one does at Nuremberg; {{it would be difficult}} to say why. When they found the Little Goose Man, he was only a mediaeval fancy in bronze, who stood on his pedestal in the market-place and contributed from the bill of the goose under his arm a small stream to the rainfall drenching the wet wares of the wet market-women round the fountain, and soaking their cauliflowers and lettuce, their grapes and pears, their carrots and turnips, to the watery flavor of <b>all</b> <b>fruits</b> and vegetables in Germany.|$|E
60|$|Sometimes, Ghibba told Nod, Fishing-mulgars, {{who have}} given up <b>all</b> <b>fruits</b> and nuts to gluttonize, and live only on fish, have been known by much feeding to waste quite away. Moreover, {{a few years of}} this cold fishing paralyses their tails. And so many go misshapen. On being {{questioned}} as to where they had learned to make fire, the Fishing-mulgars told Ghibba that a certain squinting Môh-mulgar had come their way once along the torrent, tongue-tied and trembling with palsy. By the fire he had made for himself the Fishing-mulgars, after he was gone, had stacked wood, and this was the selfsame fire that had been kept burning ever since. Did once this fire die out, not knowing of, nor having any, first-sticks, it would be raw fish for the tribe for evermore. On hearing this, the travellers looked long at one another between gladness and dismay--gladness to hear that their father Seelem (if it was he) had come alive out of the Orchards, and dismay for his many ills.|$|E
60|$|When {{the fruit}} is ripe it falls of itself, {{and the only}} way to eat Durians in {{perfection}} is to get them as they fall; and the smell is then less overpowering. When unripe, it makes a very good vegetable if cooked, and it is also eaten by the Dyaks raw. In a good fruit season large quantities are preserved salted, in jars and bamboos, and kept the year round, when it acquires a most disgusting odour to Europeans, but the Dyaks appreciate it highly as a relish with their rice. There are in the forest two varieties of wild Durians with much smaller fruits, one of them orange-coloured inside; and these are probably the origin of the large and fine Durians, which are never found wild. It would not, perhaps, be correct to say that the Durian is the best of <b>all</b> <b>fruits,</b> because it cannot supply the place of the subacid juicy kinds, such as the orange, grape, mango, and mangosteen, whose refreshing and cooling qualities are so wholesome and grateful; but as producing a food of the most exquisite flavour, it is unsurpassed. If I had to fix on two only, as representing the perfection of the two classes, I should certainly choose the Durian and the Orange as the king and queen of fruits.|$|E
