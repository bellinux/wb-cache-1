5|$|Michelangelo painted {{onto the}} damp plaster using a wash {{technique}} to apply broad areas of colour, {{then as the}} surface became drier, he revisited these areas with a more linear approach, adding shade and detail {{with a variety of}} brushes. For some textured surfaces, such as facial hair and woodgrain, he used a broad brush with bristles as sparse as <b>a</b> <b>comb.</b> He employed all the finest workshop methods and best innovations, combining them with a diversity of brushwork and breadth of skill far exceeding that of the meticulous Ghirlandaio.|$|E
5|$|In tribal societies, kilim were woven {{by women}} at {{different}} stages of their lives: before marriage, in readiness for married life; while married, for her children; and finally, kilim for her own funeral, to be given to the mosque. Kilims thus had strong personal and social significance in tribal and village cultures, being made for personal and family use. Feelings of happiness or sorrow, hopes and fears were expressed in the weaving motifs. Many of these represent familiar household and personal objects, such as a hairband, <b>a</b> <b>comb,</b> an earring, a trousseau chest, a jug, a hook.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, {{with the}} help of a friend, the then 28-year-old Ho set up shop in Chinatown with only <b>a</b> <b>comb,</b> a stool, and a {{kerosene}} lamp. She worked from 8am to 3am, charging five cents to comb hair or weave plaits and buns for amahs and Samsui women. She did that every day for almost three decades, interrupted only by periods when she was incapacitated by acute attacks of arthritis. She scrimped and saved, and by the time she was in her 40s, she had enough to buy a shophouse in Club Street. Although illiterate, she made some property investments and eventually became a landlord, renting out rooms. As her wealth grew, she acquired more properties, and she began to adopt children from poor families, becoming a single mother of six daughters and twenty-five godchildren.|$|E
5|$|In 1973 a jadeitite axehead {{was found}} {{alongside}} the track; {{it is thought}} to have been placed there as an offering. One of over 100similar axe heads found in Britain and Ireland, its good condition and its precious material suggest that it was a symbolic axe, rather than one used to cut wood. Because of the difficulty of working this material, which was derived from the Alpine area of Europe, all the axe heads of this type found in Great Britain are thought to have been non-utilitarian and to have represented some form of currency or be the products of gift exchange. Radiocarbon dating of the peat in which the axe head was discovered suggests that it was deposited in about 3200 BC. Wooden artefacts found at the site include paddles, a dish, arrow shafts, parts of four hazel bows, a throwing axe, yew pins, digging sticks, a mattock, <b>a</b> <b>comb,</b> toggles, and a spoon fragment. Finds made from other materials, such as flint flakes, arrowheads, and a chipped flint axe (in mint condition) have also been made.|$|E
5|$|In April 1948 he {{once again}} {{travelled}} with England to Hampden Park, helping his country to a 2–0 victory; however after the match {{he was the}} subject of an FA inquiry after he claimed tea and scones on his expenses (at the cost of sixpence). Regardless of this treatment by the FA, the next month he helped England record a 4–0 victory over Italy in Turin. Folklore told that he beat Alberto Eliani only to have the audacity to then pull <b>a</b> <b>comb</b> from his shorts pocket and comb his hair; the reality was that he simply used his hand to wipe his sweating brow in the beating Italian sun. However the legend would follow him around the world in later life, and spectators in the crowd were convinced that they had witnessed it. Later in the year he played in a goalless draw with Denmark, a 6–2 win over Northern Ireland, a 1–0 win over Wales, and a 6–0 triumph over Switzerland.|$|E
50|$|The {{rectilinear}} <b>comb</b> uses <b>a</b> circular <b>comb</b> {{mounted on}} <b>a</b> drum to <b>comb</b> out the fringe and remove short fiber (set by a scale so fibers less than, for example, 25 mm are removed) not {{held by a}} clamping mechanism. The row of pins known as <b>a</b> top <b>comb</b> is <b>a</b> very fine tooth comb, for example 25 teeth per inch; it is inserted in cylindrical combed fringe {{to act as an}} impediment to contaminates (burr, seed etc.) flow. The top <b>comb</b> acts as <b>an</b> impediment to contamination moving into <b>a</b> <b>combed</b> sliver. On <b>a</b> next circular <b>combing</b> short finer and contaminates are removed. The circular combing without short fibers are placed on a moving belt in an overlapping motion. The circular combing and top comb insertion is repeated and combed fibers - now called tuft are overlapped. The overlapping produces some cohesion allowing the tuft then to be twisted to form <b>a</b> <b>combed</b> sliver. This sliver is weak and unsuitable for spinning. To allow spinning to take place additional gilling is required to introduce fiber end irregularity (Sokolov 1994).|$|R

5|$|Originally, the sublingua in lemurs {{was thought}} to be a vestigial organ {{inherited}} from their mammalian ancestors. In lemuriform primates, the sublingua is used to remove hair and debris from the highly specialized toothcomb, an arrangement of four or six long, forward-facing teeth in the lower jaw used in oral grooming. The toothcomb of lemuriforms consists of both incisors and canine teeth (which reinforce the incisors), and together, these finely spaced teeth act like teeth on <b>a</b> <b>comb.</b> Although the cleaning function has been suspected for nearly a century, there has been no clear confirmation of this. However, a study from 1941 presented evidence that the toothcomb accumulated a mat of hair during oral grooming, and the author did observe that lemurs extend and retract their tongue rapidly, possibly to use the sublingua to clean the toothcomb.|$|E
5|$|The katipo {{typically}} catches wandering ground invertebrates such as beetles (e.g. Cecyropa modesta) or amphipods (e.g. Bellorchestia quoyana), {{but it may}} occasionally catch moths, flies, {{and other}} spiders. Katipo can catch insects much larger than themselves. These larger insects often become entangled in the web and in the ensuing struggle, the web's ground anchor line breaks. Due to the silk's elasticity, this causes the prey to become suspended a few centimetres off the ground. The katipo then moves to the prey, turns so that the spinnerets are facing the insect and spins silk over it. Like most theridiids, the tarsi of the hind legs have a row of strong curved bristles which are arranged as <b>a</b> <b>comb.</b> The katipo uses these to scoop sticky silk from her spinnerets and throws it over the insect {{with a series of}} rapid movements. After the insect is firmly immobilised, she bites it several times, usually at the joints, before spinning more silk to strengthen the web, and then administering a last long bite which ultimately kills the insect. The spider then moves the prey up into the web until it is ready to eat. If food is readily available then it is common to see five or six insects hanging in the web waiting to be ingested. The male's hunting behaviour is similar to the female's, although may not be as vigorous due to its smaller size.|$|E

40|$|Importance-weighted combing {{techniques}} {{can be used}} to control particle populations through-out a problem with widely varying importances. However, <b>a</b> naive importance-weighted <b>comb</b> does not preserve the total particle weight. This is generally unimportant for neutron and photon transport. However, this can be very important in simulations of charged particles where the particles are generating the electric field that they are being transported through.

25|$|In acoustics, comb {{filtering}} {{can arise}} in some unwanted ways.

Because the reflected sound takes a longer path, it constitutes a delayed version of the direct sound and <b>a</b> <b>comb</b> filter is created where the two combine at the listener.|$|E
