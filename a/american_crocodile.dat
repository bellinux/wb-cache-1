5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are less}} vulnerable to cold than American crocodiles. Unlike an <b>American</b> <b>crocodile,</b> which would immediately succumb to the cold and drown in water at , an American alligator can survive in such temperatures for some time without displaying any signs of discomfort. This adaptiveness {{is thought to be}} the reason why American alligators are widespread further north than the <b>American</b> <b>crocodile.</b> In fact, the American alligator is found farther from the equator and is more equipped to handle cooler conditions than any other crocodilian. When the water begins to freeze, American alligators stick their snouts through the surface which allows them to breathe above the ice.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians are {{opportunistic}} predators {{that are}} at their most dangerous in water and {{at the edge of}} water. Eight species are known to attack humans and may do so to defend their territories, nests, or young; by mistake, while attacking domestic animals such as dogs; or for food, as larger crocodilians can take prey as big as or bigger than humans. The species on which there is most data are the saltwater crocodile, the Nile crocodile, and the American alligator. Other species which have sometimes attacked humans are the black caiman, the Morelet's crocodile, the mugger crocodile, the <b>American</b> <b>crocodile,</b> the gharial, and the freshwater crocodile.|$|E
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>Crocodile</b> (Crocodylus acutus) is also {{native to}} the region and has been {{designated}} as endangered since 1975. Unlike their relatives the alligators, crocodiles tend to thrive in brackish or salt-water habitats such as estuarine or marine coasts. Their most significant threat is disturbance by people. Too much contact with humans causes females to abandon their nests, and males in particular are often victims of vehicle collisions while roaming over large territories and attempting to cross U.S. 1 and Card Sound Road in the Florida Keys. There are an estimated 500 to 1,000crocodiles in southern Florida.|$|E
25|$|<b>American</b> <b>crocodiles,</b> unlike <b>American</b> alligators, are {{extremely}} {{susceptible to cold}} temperatures and live exclusively within tropical waters.

5|$|The park's {{margins are}} habitat for the {{threatened}} <b>American</b> <b>crocodile.</b> The construction {{of miles of}} cooling water canals in the marl lands close to the shore behind the Turkey Point power plant, and the canals' warm waters, have provided a nearly ideal environment for crocodile nesting, making the power plant a nursery for many of those living in the park. Although crocodiles and American alligators both occur in extreme southern Florida, alligators are uncommon in Biscayne, since alligators mainly inhabit fresh waters found farther inland, while crocodiles can live in Biscayne's somewhat saltier estuarine waters.|$|E

25|$|Adult American {{crocodiles}} have {{no natural}} predators and almost any terrestrial or riparian animal they encounter is potential prey. American crocodiles are known predators of lemon sharks, and sharks avoid areas with American crocodiles. Usually American crocodiles are dominant over American alligators. However, on one occasion, an <b>American</b> <b>crocodile</b> in a Florida zoo escaped its cage {{and started a}} fight with a large male American alligator in a bordering pen and was killed by the American alligator. Conversely, there is one confirmed case of an <b>American</b> <b>crocodile</b> preying on a sub-adult American alligator in the wild in Florida. American alligators and American crocodiles do not often come into conflict in the wild normally, due largely to habitat partitioning and largely separate distributions. There are several records of American crocodiles killing and eating spectacled caimans (Caiman crocodilus) in South America as well as additional records of cannibalism there. Areas with healthy <b>American</b> <b>crocodile</b> populations often hold only limited numbers of spectacled caimans, while conversely areas that formerly held American crocodiles but {{where they are now}} heavily depleted or are locally extinct show a growth of caiman numbers, due to less competition as well as predation. In areas where the two species coexist, the smaller but more aggressive Cuban crocodile is behaviorally dominant over the larger <b>American</b> <b>crocodile.</b> In Mexico some Morelet's crocodile individuals have escaped from captivity, establishing feral populations and creating a problem for the populations of <b>American</b> <b>crocodile,</b> which must compete with this invasive species.|$|E

25|$|C. acutus is {{the most}} {{widespread}} of the four extant species of crocodiles from the Americas. It inhabits waters such as mangrove swamps, river mouths, fresh waters, and salt lakes, and can even be found at sea, hence its wide distribution throughout the Caribbean islands, southern Florida, the Greater Antilles, southern Mexico, Central America, and the South American countries of Colombia and Ecuador. The <b>American</b> <b>crocodile</b> is especially plentiful in Costa Rica. One of its largest documented populations is in Lago Enriquillo, a hypersaline lake in the Dominican Republic. The species has also been recorded from Jamaica. American crocodiles have recently been sighted in Grand Cayman, leading experts to believe the species may be swimming from Cuba (which {{is home to a}} massive <b>American</b> <b>crocodile</b> population) and slowly repopulating Grand Cayman. In addition, an American crocodile/Cuban crocodile hybrid was recently discovered in the Cancun area. The crocodile likely originated in the Zapata Swamp of Cuba (the only place where these wild hybrids exist) and swam to the Yucatán Peninsula. Their saline tolerance also allowed the <b>American</b> <b>crocodile</b> to colonize limited portions of the United States (extreme southern Florida). Contrary to popular misinformation, the presence of the American alligator is not the reason the <b>American</b> <b>crocodile</b> was unable to populate brackish waters north of Florida, but rather the climate.|$|E

During 2009, unusually cold weather in southern Florida resulted {{in the deaths of}} about 150 wild <b>American</b> <b>crocodiles,</b> including a well-known crocodile which inhabited Sanibel Island far north of their natural range.American crocodiles in the United States coexist with the American alligator, and are primarily found south of the latitude of Miami, in Everglades National Park, Florida Bay, Biscayne Bay, and the Florida Keys. A sizable population occurs near Homestead, Florida, at the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station. Some individuals wander northward to warm summer waters and have been sighted in Sarasota County and Palm Beach County. In the summer of 2008, a crocodile was captured in the surf on Isle of Palms, South Carolina. In 2013, a 700-pound crocodile was captured in Tarpon Springs, Florida. Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission program staff note that the crocodile was not weighed to be 700 lbs. The weight was estimated by the nuisance alligator trapper who inadvertently caught the animal using a baited hook. <b>American</b> <b>crocodiles</b> of similar lengths have been accurately weighed at 450-500 lbs.|$|R
25|$|This species exists {{mostly in}} {{tropical}} areas with distinct rainy seasons, {{and the young}} hatch near {{the time of the}} first rains of the summer (July–August), after the preceding dry season and before the bodies of water where they live flood. In this stage of development of their young, mother <b>American</b> <b>crocodiles</b> exhibit a unique mode of parental care. During the hatching process, when the young <b>American</b> <b>crocodiles</b> are most vulnerable to predation, they will instinctively call out in soft, grunt-like croaks. These sounds trigger the female to attend to the nest, uncovering the eggs if they have been covered. Then she will aid the hatchlings in escaping their eggs and scoop them up with her mouth, carrying them to the closest water source.|$|R

25|$|Due to hide hunting, pollution, loss of habitat, {{and removal}} of adults for {{commercial}} farming, the <b>American</b> <b>crocodile</b> is endangered {{in parts of}} its range.

25|$|The {{habitat of}} the <b>American</b> <b>crocodile</b> {{consists}} largely of coastal areas. It {{is also found}} in river systems, but has a tendency to prefer, not merely to tolerate, some level of salinity, resulting in the species congregating in brackish lakes, mangrove swamps, lagoons, cays, and small islands. Other crocodiles also have tolerance to salt water due to salt glands underneath the tongue, but the <b>American</b> <b>crocodile</b> is the only species other than the saltwater crocodile (C. porosus) to commonly live and thrive in salt water. They can be found on beaches and small island formations without any freshwater source, such as some of the many cays and islets across the Bahamas and the Caribbean. They are also found in hypersaline lakes; one of the largest known populations inhabits the Lago Enriquillo.|$|E
25|$|The larger {{species of}} {{crocodiles}} are very dangerous to humans, {{mainly because of}} their ability to strike before the person can react. The saltwater crocodile and Nile crocodile are the most dangerous, killing hundreds of people each year in parts of Southeast Asia and Africa. The mugger crocodile and <b>American</b> <b>crocodile</b> are also dangerous to humans.|$|E

2500|$|The hatchlings, {{which are}} [...] in length, have been {{reported}} to actively hunt prey within a few days of hatching. It is not uncommon for the mother to care for her young even weeks after they have hatched, remaining attentive to their calls and continuing to provide transportation. About five weeks after hatching, the young <b>American</b> <b>crocodiles</b> disband in search of their own independent lives. Most of them, of course, will not survive, being preyed upon by several types of raptorial birds and larger fishes (e.g. barred catfish (Pseudoplatystoma fasciatum), Atlantic tarpons (Megalops atlanticus), common snook (Centropomis undecimalis) and lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris)), boa constrictors (Boa constrictor), black spiny-tailed iguana (Ctenosaura similis), spectacled caimans, as well as raccoons. Those that do survive the early stages of life will grow rapidly, feeding on insects, fish and frogs.
