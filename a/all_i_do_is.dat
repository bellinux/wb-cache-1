500|$|Today they {{finished}} shooting my {{portion of the}} picture and I am certainly glad it's over with. [...] <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> sing [...] "Hate to Get Up in the Morning" [...] as I did in the show, but the camera is a severe judge and I am afraid even with the great amount of care and fuss they can't improve what the Fates decreed to be a homely face. [...] As for my voice, I made a recording. [...] When the record was first played on the set, one of the electricians, who didn't know whose voice it was, said, [...] "If the guy who wrote that song could hear the record, he would turn over in his grave"--which gives you a fair idea. [...] However I am hoping it won't be too bad.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] was {{directed}} by Alex De Rakoff in early November 2004. Clarkson told MTV that she conceived {{the idea of the}} video after assuming that revenge is what every girl wants to do when their boyfriend cheats on them. She added, [...] "You know, 'Why don't I just go trash her house? [...] And so I do it in the video. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> break stuff. It's a cool job. I could get used to this." [...] Clarkson expressed that in the music video, viewers would get to see her act out of character. She explained, [...] "In the beginning, I'm like tipping things over and smearing mud all over the walls and it seems like my apartment, but it ends up being the other girl's that he's with, so it's a humorous video." [...] The music video premiered on Total Request Live on November 16, 2004.|$|E
50|$|You know, it's overwhelming, and I'm really touched. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> surf {{a little}} and tell my story.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not {{guilty of}} pitilessness: <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to cheer up, {{according}} to my name, for my name is not Pitiless, but Cheer-up; and I could not abide to see Mansoul inclined to melancholy.' ...|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Melvyn Bragg, Emin commented on the incident: “I don’t see why I was such a slag. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> sleep with a few people. It’s not a crime, I didn’t kill anyone.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Gutta {{has spoken}} against body shaming in sports. In an {{interview}} she said, [...] "I don't understand this image thing. What's wrong in liking clothes or dressing up? In India, {{there is this}} image that if you dress shabbily, you are a serious sportsperson. If you care about dressing up, you aren't one. People are under the impression I lead an exciting life but honestly, <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> sleep, eat and practice". Gutta is also a celebrity endorser and {{has been associated with}} several brands and services, also appearing on the covers of numerous magazines.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, but I {{want him}} to be happy,' cried Margaret vehemently. 'You know that I owe {{everything}} to him. I'd do all I could to make him happy, even if I had to sacrifice myself. But I can't sacrifice myself, because I love him so much that <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> pure delight.' ...|$|E
60|$|LILY--Go to the devil. I knew you'd say that. Well, {{fight the}} good fight. You have all my best wishes. [With a sigh.] I wish I had {{something}} worth fighting for. Now that I'm through with college, my occupation's gone. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> read book after book. The only live {{people are the}} ones in books, I find, and the only live life.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Leland. [...] "He earns his pay, and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> {{to make it}} {{a little}} easier for him. He got himself mixed up with a {{threshing}} mill at another place a while ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think so, but {{of course}} it isn't mine to give away. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to give your father some {{information}} which should help him to find it before anybody else. He means to send up a prospecting party at once." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>All</b> <b>I</b> Can <b>Do</b> <b>is</b> the 17th solo studio album by Dolly Parton, {{released}} in August 1976. The album {{was nominated for}} a Grammy for Best Female Country Vocal. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> Can <b>Do</b> <b>was</b> the last Parton album on which Porter Wagoner would get producing credit.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you stay}} here," [...] said Honora, {{with a new}} firmness, [...] "it will be alone. I can't see what you want with a wife, anyway. I've been {{thinking}} you over lately. I don't do anything for you, except to keep getting you cooks--and anybody could do that. You don't seem to need me in any possible way. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to loiter {{around the house and}} read and play the piano, or go to New York and buy clothes for nobody to look at except strangers in restaurants. I'm worth more than that. I think I'll get married again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “A labour-saving {{device for}} mariners, {{navigation}} reduced to kindergarten simplicity,” he answered gaily. “From to-day {{a child will}} be able to navigate a ship. No more long-winded calculations. All you need is one star in the sky on a dirty night to know instantly where you are. Look. I place the transparent scale on this star-map, revolving the scale on the North Pole. On the scale I’ve worked out the circles of altitude and the lines of bearing. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to put it on a star, revolve the scale till it is opposite those figures on the map underneath, and presto! there you are, the ship’s precise location!” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How can I explain?" [...] he {{said with}} a half amused, half puzzled air. [...] "The feeling's not vanity. I have a {{conviction}} that this is my job, and now that I begin to see my way, I have to put it through. I'm not swaggering about my abilities--there are smarter men in many ways at Allenwood; my strong point is this: I can see how things are going, and feel the drift of forces I didn't set in motion and can't control. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to fall into line and let them carry me forward, instead of standing against the stream. The world demands a higher standard of economical efficiency; in using the best tools and the latest methods I'm obeying the call." ...|$|E
5000|$|Speaking {{about his}} unbeaten streak, Jahangir said: [...] "It wasn't my {{plan to create}} such a record. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> put {{in the effort to}} win every match I played and it went on for weeks, months and years until my defeat to Ross Norman in Toulouse in 1986." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{was never}} a {{criminal}} mastermind, but rather a foolish former footballer with more money than sense... It sounds so big-time, so glamorous doesn't it? <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> lend some money to blokes I thought {{were going to make}} a few quid by knocking out cheap imitation jewellery." [...] — Storey speaking on his downfall.|$|R
5000|$|... "Caddyshack was {{my first}} film and I'll say that the end product was so {{completely}} different, it was originally about the caddies. So at first, I {{had nothing to lose}} to audition. It <b>was</b> fun. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> focus on making the person sweat. Look 'em in the eye, do that thing many women know how to..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know--I've {{been looking}} it up--the Firth Of Clyde, {{where all the}} steel ships are built, isn't half as wide as Oakland Creek down there, where all those old hulks lie? Why ain't it a Firth of Clyde? Because the Oakland City Council spends its time debating about prunes and raisins. What is needed is {{somebody}} to see things, and, after that, organization. That's me. I didn't make Ophir for nothing. And once things begin to hum, outside capital will pour in. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> start it going. 'Gentlemen,' I say, 'here's all the natural advantages for a great metropolis. God Almighty put them advantages here, and he put me here to see them. Do you want to land your tea and silk from Asia and ship it straight East? Here's the docks for your steamers, and here's the railroads. Do you want factories {{from which you can}} ship direct by land or water? Here's the site, and here's the modern, up-to-date city, with the latest improvements for yourselves and your workmen, to live in.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know nothing}} of my motive for leaving Italy," [...] he began, [...] "except that it was for {{political}} reasons. If I had been driven to this country by the persecution of my government, I should not have kept those reasons a secret from you or from any one. I have concealed them because no government authority has pronounced the sentence of my exile. You have heard, Walter, of the political societies that are hidden in every great city on the continent of Europe? To one of those societies I belonged in Italy--and belong still in England. When I came to this country, I came by the direction of my chief. I was over-zealous in my younger time--I ran the risk of compromising myself and others. For those reasons I was ordered to emigrate to England and to wait. I emigrated--I have waited--I wait still. To-morrow I may be called away--ten years hence I may be called away. It is all one to me--I am here, I support myself by teaching, and I wait. I violate no oath (you shall hear why presently) in making my confidence complete by telling you {{the name of the}} society to which I belong. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to put my life in your hands. If what I say to you now is ever known by others to have passed my lips, as certainly as we two sit here, I am a dead man." ...|$|E

Then, this morning, when I see her settin' there so cool and mighty with the boarders, and takin' the lead as usual, I just waited till she got Whit'ell across, and nearly {{everybody}} was there that saw what she done to Jeff, and then I flew out on her." ...|$|R

And when I spotted this slice of his I just gave him a bit of advice. I give you my word that was all. He can't have left me a fortune on the {{strength}} of that!' ...|$|R

They said I was as Iron Man (a name I always wanted to avoid), when really <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> slip {{this way and that}} as the occasion required. Brother Mike was a past master at that. I never saw anyone to equal him at all. He taught it to me." [...] - Tommy Gibbons from Punches I Have Taken ...|$|R

50|$|<b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> come up {{and tell}} the people who I am and what we're up to. I don't have a single {{thing to do with}} producing, {{directing}} or casting the show.

5000|$|Jumped - A younger teen boy is chased {{through a}} parking lot by three older males, who beat {{him to the ground}} and kick him. In narration, the boy wishes he had been {{assaulted}} that night, because then he would not have tried meth. The worst of the three assailants raises a cinder block high over his head, threatening to drop it on the boy and crush his skull. The camera cuts to a drug den, where the boy, shaking, vomiting and decayed says sadly, [...] "now <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> meth." ...|$|E
5000|$|Richards later took credit as 'D.M. Richards' and distanced {{himself from}} the final product. [...] "I {{had nothing to do}} with the editing of the film," [...] he said later. [...] "I was one of five directors. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> the casting and 13 days of shooting... I should have taken my name off it entirely." [...] A Directors Guild {{arbitration}} ruled that Richards was responsible for 41% of the finished film and Jerry Jameson 31%.|$|R
