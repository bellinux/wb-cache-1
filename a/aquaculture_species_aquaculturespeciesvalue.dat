This article classifies environmental factors in a way that facilitates economic analysis of their implications for the selection of <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species</b> and systems. The implication of on-farm as on-site environmental conditions for this selection are considered first using profit-possibility frontiers and taking into account the biological law of environmental tolerance. However, in selecting, recommending and developing <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species</b> and systems, it is often unrealistic to assume the degree of managerial efficiency implied by the profit-possibility function. It is appropriate to take account of the degree of managerial inefficiency that actually exists, not all of which may be capable of being eliminated. Furthermore, experimental R&D should be geared to on-farm conditions, and the variability of these conditions needs to be taken into account. Particularly in shared water bodies, environmental spillovers between aquaculturalists can be important and as shown theoretically, can influence the socially optimal selection of <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species</b> and systems. Similarly, aquaculture can have environmental consequences for the rest of the community. The social economic implications of this for the selection of <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species</b> and systems are analyzed. Some paradoxical results are obtained. For example, if the quality of social governance of aquaculture is poor, <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species</b> and systems that cause a slow rate of environmental deterioration may be socially less satisfactory than those that cause a rapid rate of such deterioration. Socially optimal choice of <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species</b> and systems depends not only on their biophysical characteristics and market conditions but also on the prevailing state of governance of aquaculture. Failure to consider the last aspect can result in the introduction of new <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species</b> (and systems) doing more social harm than good. aquaculture, selection of <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species,</b> Environmental Economics and Policy, Farm Management,...|$|R

There is a strong focus on the development of new <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species,</b> including spiny lobsters, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, and various fin fish species.

40|$|Walleye, Stitzostedion vitreum, has {{potential}} to be an <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species</b> in the North Central Region because: it is native to the region; it maintains optimum growth at temperatures lower than many other current <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species</b> (such as channel catfish); it is a highly-prized sport fish; its flesh is considered a delicacy; and the fillets are high in protein and. low in fat, making walleye an attractive food selection for today’s health conscious consumer...|$|R

There is already a well established export of wild rock lobster from Australia, especially Southern Australia which currently lands just over 3000 tonnes a year.

30|$|Trials using {{several species}} of {{filamentous}} green algae (Ulva, Chaetomorpha, and Cladophora) as raw or dried feed for aquacultured crustaceans and fish have recently been successfully conducted. Integrated aquaculture of brackish water prawns or freshwater herbivorous fish from tropical zones with species from the genus Ulva has resulted in increased growth of <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species</b> (Limsuwan et al. 2008; Cruz-Suárez et al. 2010; Gamboa-Delgado et al. 2011; Siddik and Anh 2015). Although other filamentous green seaweeds including Chaetomorpha and Cladophora may be as easily applied in intensive aquaculture systems as Ulva species because of their euryhalinity, so far only few studies have investigated their application as raw feed for <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species</b> (Tsutsui et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|Tilapia {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species</b> in the world.

This paper investigates the degree of market integration between tilapia from the three largest production regions, Asia, Africa and South and Central America. The study considers the different production methods, transport costs and qualities between the world’s largest producers and determines whether tilapia products from different producers can essentially be considered the same product. This is important in order to understand the fast development of farmed tilapia worldwide and its prospects for future development...|$|R

Research reveals that dietary nucleotide may have significant impact and is recommended to add to the feed of aquatic species to get better performance. However, more studies should also be conducted to have better understandings on dose requirement, duration of application, impact on different life stage and under different environmental stress and pathogens. Further study should also examine the effects of dietary nucleotide supplementation of intestinal microbiota and gut morphology, and immune response of <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{applications}} of molecular techniques in aquaculture are promising, but still some what uncertain. While high costs {{seem to be}} the only hindrance for widespread application of DNA markers for identification purposes and marker assisted selection, the situation regarding commercial use of genetically modified fish is more complex. Although the potential importance of gene transfer technology is large, a major concern relates to the possible impact, which release or accidental escapes of gene-modified individuals may have on natural ecosystems. Other technologies are also rapidly emerging which are either being used or are likely {{to be used in the}} future in the <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species.</b> For example micro-array technology has the potential to contribute very large amounts of information on the genes and pathways of genes, which affect the economic traits in <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species...</b>|$|R
50|$|Growth rate - {{growth rate}} is {{normally}} measured as either body weight or body length. This trait {{is of great}} economic importance for all <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species</b> as faster growth rate speeds up the turnover of production.

50|$|The farms {{generally}} {{have their own}} hatchery and the whole operation involves hatching, growing, harvesting and processing in an integrated continual process operation.

50|$|Selective {{breeding}} in aquaculture provide remarkable {{economic benefits}} to the industry, the primary one being that it reduces production costs due to faster turnover rates. This is because of faster growth rates, decreased maintenance rates, increased energy and protein retention, and better feed efficiency.

40|$|Epigenetics has {{attracted}} considerable attention {{with respect to}} its potential value {{in many areas of}} agricultural production, particularly under conditions where the environment can be manipulated or natural variation exists. Here we introduce key concepts and definitions of epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNA, review the current understanding of epigenetics in both fish and shellfish, and propose key areas of aquaculture where epigenetics could be applied. The first key area is environmental manipulation, where the intention is to induce an ‘epigenetic memory’ either within or between generations to produce a desired phenotype. The second key area is epigenetic selection, which, alone or combined with genetic selection, may increase the reliability of producing animals with desired phenotypes. Based on aspects of life history and husbandry practices in <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species,</b> the application of epigenetic knowledge could significantly affect the productivity and sustainability of aquaculture practices. Conversely, clarifying the role of epigenetic mechanisms in <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species</b> may upend traditional assumptions about selection practices. Ultimately, there are still many unanswered questions regarding how epigenetic mechanisms might be leveraged in aquaculture...|$|R
