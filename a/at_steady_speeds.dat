50|$|Fuel economy <b>at</b> <b>steady</b> <b>speeds</b> with {{selected}} vehicles was {{studied in}} 2010. The most recent study indicates greater fuel efficiency at higher speeds than earlier studies; for example, some vehicles achieve better fuel economy at 100 km/h {{rather than at}} 70 km/h, although not their best economy, such as the 1994 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera with the LN2 2.2L engine, which has its best economy at 90 km/h (8.1 L/100 km mpg), and gets 2 mpg better economy at 105 km/h than at 72 km/h (9.4 L/100 km mpg vs 22 mpg). The proportion of driving on high speed roadways varies from 4% in Ireland to 41% in the Netherlands.|$|E

50|$|Economy also {{requires}} that the throttle be wide open and that the boiler pressure is at the maximum safe level to maximise thermal efficiency. For economy, a steam engine is used of a size such that the most economical settings yield {{the right amount of}} power most of the time, such as when a train is running <b>at</b> <b>steady</b> <b>speed</b> on level track.|$|R

5000|$|People jaywalk {{for various}} reasons, {{including}} convenience {{and sometimes even}} personal safety, generally to cross the street. Going to a crosswalk can require a long detour. Pedestrians are often forced to walk outside crosswalks, when they are blocked by cars due to traffic congestion or drivers stopping too far forward. The common practice of car-centric traffic-signal synchronization produces green waves for motorists but not necessarily for pedestrians, who may encounter little or no conflicting traffic at cross streets where signals instruct them to wait. Where signalized crosswalks require a pedestrian to trigger their operation, they are at times unusable for some Jewish people who observe Shabbat. Also, pedestrians are generally unwilling to observe lengthy wait times at signals. They {{are also more likely}} to make [...] "informal crossings" [...] at wide roads, or at locations where formal crosswalks are simply too distant to be practical for them to use. Also, pedestrians may dislike using intersections for other reasons, such as being uncomfortable dealing with traffic from a multitude of directions (whereas jaywalking at a location distant from an intersection results in the need to observe only two directions of traffic), or wanting to avoid the extra air emissions generated by vehicles stopping and starting (given that vehicular emissions are significantly less when vehicles are moving <b>at</b> <b>steady</b> <b>speeds).</b>|$|E

A finite volume method is adopted to solve the essentially 2 D RANS, time-dependent equations in a body-fitted co-ordinate system. Two problems have been examined for a 50 m body of revolution: (a) the stopping maneuver, i. e. crash stop from <b>steady</b> forward <b>speed</b> and then full astern and (b) full ahead <b>at</b> <b>steady</b> <b>speed</b> from rest and then full astern.

40|$|The {{problem of}} biped {{locomotion}} <b>at</b> <b>steady</b> <b>speeds</b> is discussed through a Lagrangian formulation developed for velocity-dependent, body driving forces. Human {{walking on a}} level surface is analyzed {{in terms of the}} data on the resultant ground-reaction force and the external work. It is shown that the trajectory of the center of mass is due to a superposition of its rectilinear motion with a given speed and a backward rotation along a shortened hypocycloid. A stiff-to-compliant crossover between walking gaits is described and the maximum speed for human walking, given by an instability of the trajectory, is predicted.

40|$|Terrestrial {{animals that}} move with a {{bouncing}} gait, such as running, trotting or hopping, {{take advantage of}} energy stored elastically in the limbs to reduce the metabolic cost of locomotion <b>at</b> <b>steady</b> <b>speeds</b> (Alexander, 1988; Cavagna et al., 1977; Taylor, 1994). Wallabies are among {{a large group of}} cursorial animals that have evolved muscle–tendon units with short fibers and long tendons that appear particularly well adapted for this purpose (Alexander and Vernon, 1975; Alexander et al., 1982; Dimery et al., 1986; Ker et al., 1986). Because the architecture of muscle–tendon units has a strong influence on muscle function, having muscle groups that are specialized for one function may therefore limit their ability to perform others. Specifically, muscle–tendon units that function well for storing elastic energy may be ill suited for producin...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} was {{performed with the}} purpose of comparing the arodynamic drag of an automobile as measured in a full-scale wind tunnel with the drag as measured on the road. A definition of the drag coefficient as measured both on the road and in the wind tunnel is given in advance in order to allow a comparison to be made between the two operating conditions. Three medium size european cars were selected, one notch-back type and two hatch-back types. Road testing was mainly based on the coast-down method. The total resistance was determined by statistical analysis of the experimental results. The theoretical basis and the specifications of the procedure are investigated and justified. Additional outdoor and indoor tests were carried out in order to isolate the aerodynamic drag. The wind tunnel tests were conducted on the same cars fully equipped as tested on the road and in the same speed range. The wind tunnel tests being executed <b>at</b> <b>steady</b> <b>speeds,</b> however, supplementary road tests were performed {{in order to determine the}} effect of the deceleration on the aerodynamic drag. The final results show only small differences between the aerodynamic drag coefficients as measured in the wind tunnel and on the road with the procedure here describe...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{experiments in}} which a vertical surface-piercing circular cylinder with a large draught was towed <b>at</b> <b>steady</b> <b>speeds</b> through water initially at rest. The cylinder diameter d was 210 mm, and measurements were made of pressures around its circumference at elevations between 2. 4 d below still water level to 0. 7 d above, at Froude numbers (based on d) up to 1. 67. The tests were carried out at a constant ratio of Reynolds number to Froude number of 2. 79 x 10 (5). The total resistance coefficient reached a maximum at a Froude number of about 1, when {{that part of the}} loading that {{can be attributed to the}} presence of the free surface was equivalent to the submerged form drag on a length of cylinder of about 0. 9 d. Measurements are also presented of the run-up on the front of the cylinder and of the depth of the depression at the back. Previous measurements by Hay (Flow about Semi-submerged Cylinders of Finite Length. Princeton University Report, Princeton, NJ, 1947) for the case of a cylinder with a submerged free end, and by Hsieh (Proc. Am. Soc. Civil Eng. 90 (1964) 161) of forces on cylinders standing on the floor of an open channel, are reanalysed. In most respects these results are found to be compatible with the present data for a cylinder of large draught...|$|E
40|$|Forces due to {{propulsion}} should approximate forces due to {{hydrodynamic drag}} for animals horizontally swimming {{at a constant}} speed with negligible buoyancy forces. Propulsive forces should also correlate with energy expenditures associated with locomotion-an important cost of foraging. As such, biologging tags containing accelerometers {{are being used to}} generate proxies for animal energy expenditures despite being unable to distinguish rotational movements from linear movements. However, recent miniaturizations of gyroscopes offer the possibility of resolving this shortcoming and obtaining better estimates of body accelerations of swimming animals. We derived accelerations using gyroscope data for swimming Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), and determined how well the measured accelerations correlated with actual swimming speeds and with theoretical drag. We also compared dive averaged dynamic body acceleration estimates that incorporate gyroscope data, with the widely used Overall Dynamic Body Acceleration (ODBA) metric, which does not use gyroscope data. Four Steller sea lions equipped with biologging tags were trained to swim alongside a boat cruising <b>at</b> <b>steady</b> <b>speeds</b> in the range of 4 to 10 kph. At each speed, and for each dive, we computed a measure called Gyro-Informed Dynamic Acceleration (GIDA) using a method incorporating gyroscope data with accelerometer data. We derived a new metric-Averaged Propulsive Body Acceleration (APBA), which is the average gain in speed per flipper stroke divided by mean stroke cycle duration. Our results show that the gyro-based measure (APBA) is a better predictor of speed than ODBA. We also found that APBA can estimate average thrust production during a single stroke-glide cycle, and can be used to estimate energy expended during swimming. The gyroscope-derived methods we describe should be generally applicable in swimming animals where propulsive accelerations can be clearly identified in the signal-and they should also prove useful for dead-reckoning and improving estimates of energy expenditures from locomotion...|$|E

Replacing two cars with one bus increased the emissions by over an order of magnitude. Considering these large differences, we conclude that the importance attached to particle number emissions in traffic management policies be reassessed in the future...|$|R

50|$|There is {{some debate}} {{as to how}} much power the twin balance shafts cost the engine. The basic figure given is usually around 15 hp (11 kW), but this may be {{excessive}} for pure friction losses. It is possible that this is a miscalculation derived from the common use of an inertial dynamometer, which calculates power from angular acceleration rather than actual measurement of steady state torque. The 15 hp (11 kW), then, includes both the actual frictional loss as well as the increase in angular inertia of the rapidly rotating shafts, which would not be a factor <b>at</b> <b>steady</b> <b>speed.</b> Nevertheless, some owners modify their engines by removing the balance shafts, both to reclaim some of this power and to reduce complexity and potential areas of breakage for high-performance and racing use, as it is commonly (but falsely) believed that the smoothness provided by the balance shafts can be attained after their removal by careful balancing of the reciprocating components of the engine.|$|R
