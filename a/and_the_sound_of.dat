5|$|General Edward Braddock left Observatory Hill in Georgetown in 1755 on an {{expedition}} to capture the French Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War. Braddock's expedition was surprised on July 9 {{in the vicinity of}} present-day Braddock, Pennsylvania, in what is now known as the Battle of the Monongahela. Nearly 900 of Braddock's 1,300 men were killed or wounded, and Braddock himself killed. Since before the American Civil War, witnesses say that on the anniversary of Braddock's departure they can hear shouted military orders, horses' hooves on cobblestones, the sound of men marching, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> metal clanking against metal. The sounds can be heard near the old Long Bridge or near the Georgetown bluffs overlooking the Potomac River.|$|E
5|$|In February 2012, Legacy Recordings {{signed a}} deal with Nelson that {{included}} the release of new material, as well as past releases that would be selected and complemented with outtakes and other material selected by him. With the new deal, Buddy Cannon returned to produce the recordings of Nelson. After selecting the material <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the tunes with the singer, Cannon's work method consisted in the recording of the tracks with studio musicians, with the takes later completed on a separate session by Nelson with his guitar. Cannon's association to Nelson also extended to songwriting, with singer and producer composing the lyrics by exchanging text messages.|$|E

5|$|In {{the closing}} {{stages of the}} first half, Van Nistelrooy got his first shot on goal, turning Senderos only to send the ball {{trickling}} along the floor for Lehmann to save comfortably. The first half finished with a foul on Rooney, who had done well to break free of challenges from Cole, Vieira and Senderos, who eventually brought Rooney down. The English forward took the free kick himself, but it went over the bar to cheers from the Arsenal fans <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the referee's half-time whistle.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the player}} take severe damage, the screen will turn red <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the character's {{heartbeat}} will increase in volume; this indicates the player's health is low. The player {{must find a}} way to stay out of fire to recover before entering battle again or else will die and restart from the last checkpoint. Health is only restored through automatic recharging when the player is not taking fire. Some attacks, such as explosions from grenades or shells, will kill the player instantly if the player is too close.|$|E
5|$|A third subplot centres on the {{relationship}} between Fenwick, Mr. Puddleham, the village's Methodist minister, and the Marquis of Trowbridge, Bullhampton's principal landowner. The marquis believes that Sam Brattle is guilty of the murder, and is angered by Fenwick's support for him. He spreads rumours about Fenwick's relations with Carry Brattle, and grants Puddleham permission to build a chapel on a piece of land neighbouring Fenwick's residence, where he hopes that the sight of it <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> its bell will annoy the vicar. Fenwick tries to reconcile himself to the existence of the chapel, but it subsequently comes to light that the land does not belong to the marquis, and is instead part of the parish's glebe. The embarrassed marquis pays to move the chapel to a new location, and through the intervention of his son, a suave Member of Parliament, he and Fenwick are reconciled.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, Riverhillsoft {{released}} the first fully 3D survival horror game, Doctor Hauzer, for the 3DO. Both the player {{character and the}} environment are rendered entirely in polygons, while allowing the player to switch the view between three different perspectives: third-person, first-person, and overhead view. In a departure from most other survival horror games before and after it, Doctor Hauzer lacks any enemies; the main threat is instead the sentient house that the game takes place in, with the player having to survive the house's traps and solve puzzles. It also uses background music that heightens tension and changes depending on the situation, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the player character's echoing footsteps can change depending on the surface; these would later be used in Resident Evil. The game is today considered a formative step {{in the creation of}} the survival horror genre, improving on Alone in the Dark.|$|E
5|$|Sarah (Hana Hayes) is Joel's twelve-year-old daughter, whom he {{had when}} he was in his late teens, and the game's first playable character. The posters and photos on her wall suggest that she was a keen soccer player. At the start of the game, she gives her father a new watch for his birthday. In the early hours of the next day, she is awoken by a commotion <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> Tommy phoning Joel. Later, Joel bursts into his office, pulls a {{revolver}} out of his desk drawer and shoots their neighbor. Sarah leaves with Tommy and Joel, but her leg is hurt in a crash, forcing Joel to carry her. On the outskirts of their hometown, they come across a soldier, who follows his orders and shoots at them. Sarah is fatally wounded by bullets and dies in Joel's arms.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{indicate}} that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked {{confidence in the}} film during its production, {{and he had been}} talking to various companies, ranging from Hallmark to Microsoft, about selling Pixar. However, as the film progressed, Jobs became ever more excited about it, feeling that he might {{be on the verge of}} transforming the movie industry. As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of Toy Story that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public. A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks. Response cards from the audience were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as to how audiences would respond. The film ended with a shot of Andy's house <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> a new puppy. Michael Eisner, who attended the screening, told Lasseter afterward that the film needed to end with a shot of Woody and Buzz together, reacting to the news of the puppy.|$|E

5|$|When Me and Juliet began tryout {{performances}} in Cleveland, the duo {{realized that the}} show had problems with the plot and staging. Extensive revisions during the remaining Cleveland and Boston tryouts failed to cure the difficulties with the plot, which the critics considered weak and uninteresting. The show was met with less than favorable reviews, though Mielziner's staging won praise from audience and critics. The show closed once it had exhausted its advance sales. According to Bill Hayes the show's star in his autobiography Like Sands Through the Hourglass published in 2005 he says' We played nearly five hundred performances, all to full houses. Production costs were paid off and substantial profits went into the R till. So, though {{not in the same}} category as the storied five that were made into films - Oklahoma!, Carousel, South Pacific, The King and I <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> Music - our show must be considered a success. With the exception of a short run in Chicago, there was no national tour, and the show has seldom been seen. A small-scale production was presented by London's Finborough Theatre in 2010.|$|E
