Based on the method introduced in this letter also the gauge non-invariant second order corrections due to the pure gluonic self-energy insertion and a certain class of O(ff 3 s) and O(ff 4 <b>s)</b> <b>corrections</b> are determined. For the special choice of the gauge parameter, ¸ = 4, the leading threshold and high energy behaviour of the pure second order gluonic corrections to the cross-section are governed by the gluonic self-energy insertion. 1 Introduction As {{a consequence of the}} high precision measurements at LEP the total cross-section for quark antiquark production in e + e Γ -annihilation has been subject to extensive studies during the past years.

Together wit,h previously known corrections proportional to ZiZj, the product of the charges Zi and Zj of two interacting nuclei, it is shown tha there exist corrections proportional to the squares Z_i^ 2 and Z_j^ 2 of the charges. It is shown that the Salpeter 2 ̆ 7 s [l] corrcction due to the plasma screening of the interaction potential is at least r/d smaller(r is the nuclei size and d is Debye screening length) than previously thought and is zero in the approximation when the terms of the order r/d are neglectcd.

The results show that the new method can restore the distorted images in 3 D nearly to perfection. For all the MRI systems investigated, the mean absolute deviations in the positions of the control points (along x-, y- and z-axes) measured on the corrected phantom images were all less than 0. 2 mm. The maximum absolute deviations were all below similar to 0. 8 mm.
