In terms of wage regressions, the poor quality of schools for Black men had meant a lower value of the β coefficient on years of schooling for Black men than for White men. Thus, some of this lower β coefficient reflected a difference in the quality of education for Black workers which could have otherwise interpreted as an effect of discrimination.|$|E
5000|$|We customarily {{think of}} leakage as a {{spreading}} out of (say) a sinusoid in one [...] "bin" [...] of a DFT {{into the other}} bins at levels that generally decrease with distance. What that actually means {{is that when the}} actual sinusoid frequency lies in bin [...] "k", its presence is sensed/recorded at different levels in the other bins; i.e. the correlations they measure are non-zero. The value measured in bin k+10 and plotted on the spectrum graph is the response of that measurement to the imperfect (i.e. windowed) sinusoid 10 bins away. And when the input is just white noise (energy at all frequencies), the value measured in bin k is the sum of its responses to a continuum of frequencies. One could say that leakage is actually a leaking in process, rather than leaking out. That perspective might help to interpret the different noise-floor levels between the two graphs in the figure on the right. Both spectra were made from the same data set with the same noise power. But the bins in the bottom graph each responded more strongly than the bins in the top graph.

The effects of inter-frame interference and multiple access interference on {{the performance}} of a generic Rake receiver are investigated for asynchronous systems in frequency-selective environments. A key step is to model the asynchronous system as a chip-synchronous system with uniformly distributed timing jitter for the transmitted pulses of interfering users. This model allows the analytical technique developed for the synchronous case to be extended to the asynchronous case, and allows the derivation of closed-form equations for the bit error probability in various Rake receiver architectures. It is shown that a Gaussian approximation can be used for both multiple access and inter-frame interference as long as the number of frames per symbols is large (typically, at least 5), while there is no minimum requirement for the number of users for the equations to hold. It is observed that under many circumstances, the chip-synchronous case shows a worse bit error probability performance than the asynchronous case; the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> depends on the autocorrelation function of the ultra-wideband pulse and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio of the system.

In bats, “duration-tuned” neurons are mostly sensitive to short durations and high frequencies of sounds used for echolocation. They are scattered in the frequency maps of the inferior colliculus and auditory cortex. We found that electric stimulation of cortical duration-tuned neurons modulates collicular duration-tuned neurons in both duration and frequency tuning only when collicular and cortical neurons paired for studies are within ± 4 ms in best duration and within ± 6 kHz in best frequency. There are four types of modulations: sharpening or broadening of duration tuning, and lengthening or shortening of best duration. Sharpening is observed in “matched” collicular neurons whose best durations {{are the same as}} those of stimulated cortical neurons, and it is accompanied by augmentation of the auditory responses at their best durations. The other three types of modulations are observed in “unmatched” collicular neurons whose best durations are different from those of stimulated cortical neurons.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the roles of spectral overlap and amplitude modulation (AM) rate for stream segregation for noise signals, as well as to test the build-up effect based on these two cues. Segregation ability was evaluated using an objective paradigm with listeners’ attention focused on stream segregation. Stimulus sequences consisted of two interleaved sets of bandpass noise bursts (A and B bursts). The A and B bursts differed in spectrum, AM-rate, or both. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between the two sets of noise bursts was varied. Long and short sequences were studied to investigate the build-up effect for segregation based on spectral and AM-rate differences. Results showed the following: 1. Stream segregation ability increased with greater spectral separation. 2. Larger AM-rate separations were associated with stronger segregation abilities. 3. Spectral separation was found to elicit the build-up effect for the range of spectral differences assessed in the current study. 4. AM-rate separation interacted with spectral separation suggesting an additive effect of spectral separation and AM-rate separation on segregation build-up. The findings suggest that, when normal-hearing listeners direct their attention toward segregation, they are able to segregate auditory streams based on reduced spectral contrast cues that vary by the amount of spectral overlap. Further, regardless of the spectral separation they were able to use AM-rate difference as a secondary/weaker cue. Based on the spectral differences, listeners can segregate auditory streams better as the listening duration is prolonged—i. e. sparse spectral cues elicit build-up segregation; however, AM-rate differences only appear to elicit build-up when in combination with spectral difference cues...|$|E

The current shareholders will cover the losses arising from the depreciation reserve in the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> of the toxic assets' current book value and their market value. Under the plan, the government would bear responsibility for the management and future resale of toxic assets at its own cost and recapitalize the good bank by taking an equity stake in it. In extreme cases, this would mean a takeover of the bank by the government. The risk to taxpayers from this investment would be acceptable, however, once the banks are freed from toxic assets. A clear emphasis that the government stake is temporary would also be necessary. The government would cover the bad bank's losses, while profits would be distributed to the distressed bank's current shareholders. The plan is viable independent of whether the government decides to have one centralized bad bank or to establish a separate bad bank for each systemically relevant banking institute. Under the terms of the plan, bad banks and nationalization are not alternatives but rather {{two sides of the same}} coin. This plan effectively addresses three key challenges.

Methods: A total of 965 healthy elderly Japanese subjects aged ≥ 60 years (349 males 70. 4 ± 7. 1 years, 616 females 69. 9 ± 7. 1 years) participated in this study. Of these, 16. 6 % had suffered from a previous fall. We assumed five fall risk factors: symptoms of falling, physical function, disease and physical symptoms, environment, and behavior and character. Eighty-six items were selected to represent these factors. To confirm the component items for each risk factor, we performed factor analysis (principle factor solution and varimax rotation). The high-fall risk response rate was also calculated for each item, and significant differences in this rate were examined between groups of those who had and not had experienced a fall. Results: Useful items were selected using the following criteria: (1) items showing a significant difference in high fall risk response rate between faller and non-faller groups were selected as useful items; (2) items showing low factor loading (< 0. 4) for any factor were deleted as inappropriate items; (3) the top two items showing a greater <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in high fall risk response rate among the representative items for each factor.

Their hot working behaviors were studied through constitutive analysis based on a simple physically-based approach which accounts for <b>the</b> dependence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Young's modulus and <b>the</b> self-diffusion coefficient <b>of</b> magnesium on temperature. Since <b>the</b> main <b>difference</b> between these alloys is <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in their <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> aluminum, <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> in constitutive behavior were quantitatively characterized by relating the hot flow stress to <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> Al, which was not possible without <b>the</b> consideration <b>of</b> physically-based parameters. It was concluded that the used approach in the current work {{can be considered as}} a versatile tool in future hot working and alloy development studies...|$|R
40|$|The abundance, type, {{and thermal}} {{maturity}} {{of organic matter}} were used to characterize <b>the</b> petroleum-generating potential <b>of</b> sediments from Deep Sea Drilling Project Leg 47. Our results indi-cate that lower Miocene sediments off northwestern Africa contain sufficient <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> thermally reactive organic matter to be con-sidered potential, or future, source rocks of petroleum. Although Cretaceous sediments near <b>the</b> continental margin <b>of</b> Portugal con-tain one to two per cent organic carbon, not enough of that carbon is thermally convertible to petroleum for the sediments to generate significant <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> petroleum. <b>The</b> <b>differences</b> in petroleum-gen-erating potential are related to <b>differences</b> in <b>the</b> composition, as well as <b>the</b> <b>amount,</b> <b>of</b> preserved organic matter. Vitrinite reflec-tance data indicate that none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sediments has attained sub-sur-face temperatures high enough for significant petroleum generation...|$|R
