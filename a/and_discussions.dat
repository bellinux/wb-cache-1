40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the use and {{discourse}} functions of context frame markers in the result <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> section of research articles across four disciplines. Sixteen result <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> sections from four disciplines, namely, English Language Teaching, Economics, Biology, and Civil Engineering (four from each discipline) were analysed by adapting Gosden’s (1992) taxonomy. Findings showed disciplinary differences {{in relation to the}} realisation of the context frame types, frequencies, and associated discourse functions. These differences in terms of types, frequencies, and discourse functions of context frames are imposed {{by the nature of the}} rhetorical section of result <b>and</b> <b>discussion,</b> the nature of the discipline, and both the nature of rhetorical section of result <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>and</b> the discipline, respectively. Findings suggest that context frames are an important means which the writer uses to deliver claims and arguments in results <b>and</b> <b>discussion.</b> As a result of the dictums imposed by the generic RA section and the nature of the discipline, marked disciplinary differences are found in the writing endeavour...|$|R

The recording took place over a year in New York City, and featured jazz musicians associated with both artists. Bennett's quartet was present, including Mike Renzi, Gray Sargent, Harold Jones and Marshall Wood as well as pianist Tom Lanier. Along with Evans, jazz trumpeter Brian Newman, a long-time friend and colleague of Gaga, played on the album with his New York City based jazz quintet.

5|$|Among {{the most}} famous anti-Tom books are The Sword and the Distaff by William Gilmore Simms, Aunt Phillis's Cabin by Mary Henderson Eastman, and The Planter's Northern Bride by Caroline Lee Hentz, with the last author having been a close {{personal}} friend of Stowe's when the two lived in Cincinnati. Simms' book was published {{a few months after}} Stowe's novel, and it contains a number of sections <b>and</b> <b>discussions</b> disputing Stowe's book and her view of slavery. Hentz's 1854 novel, widely read at the time but now largely forgotten, offers a defense of slavery as seen {{through the eyes of a}} northern woman—the daughter of an abolitionist, no less—who marries a southern slave owner.|$|E
5|$|By 1922, {{concerns}} {{had grown}} {{about the condition}} of the castle <b>and</b> <b>discussions</b> took place between the Penard Golf Club, who owned the site, the Royal Institution and the Cambrian Archaeological Association. A joint committee was formed to raise the funds for repairs to the stonework but the costs appear to have been excessive and instead the gatehouse was patched with concrete between 1923 and 1924. Much of the remaining southern wall collapsed at the beginning of 1960 and an archaeological survey was conducted between 1960 and 1961. Urgent masonry repairs were then carried out in 1963, paid for by a combination of the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works, the Gower Society, the golf club and a public appeal launched by local newspapers.|$|E

5|$|Casting {{the film}} proved troublesome, {{particularly}} for the lead role of Deckard. Screenwriter Hampton Fancher envisioned Robert Mitchum as Deckard and wrote the character's dialogue with Mitchum in mind. Director Ridley Scott and the film's producers spent months meeting and discussing the role with Dustin Hoffman, who eventually departed over differences in vision. Harrison Ford was ultimately chosen for several reasons, including his performance in the Star Wars films, Ford's interest in the Blade Runner story, <b>and</b> <b>discussions</b> with Steven Spielberg who was finishing Raiders of the Lost Ark {{at the time and}} strongly praised Ford's work in the film. Following his success in films like Star Wars (1977) and Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Ford was looking for a role with dramatic depth. According to production documents, several actors were considered for the role, including Gene Hackman, Sean Connery, Jack Nicholson, Paul Newman, Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Al Pacino, and Burt Reynolds.|$|E

5|$|De Iniusta {{states that}} St-Calais was {{brought before the}} king and royal court for trial on 2 November 1088, at Salisbury, the king having confiscated the bishop's lands before the trial. At the trial St-Calais held that as a bishop {{he could not be}} tried in a secular court, and he refused to answer the accusations. Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, {{presented}} the king's case, declaring that the confiscated lands had been held as fiefs, and thus St-Calais could be tried as a vassal, not as a bishop. St-Calais objected, and continued to refuse to answer the allegations. After numerous conferences <b>and</b> <b>discussions,</b> the court held that St-Calais could be tried as a vassal in a feudal court. St-Calais then appealed to Rome, but his request was rejected by the king and the judges. Those judging the case held that because St-Calais never answered the formal accusation, and because he appealed to Rome, his fief, or the lands he held as a bishop, was forfeit.|$|E

5|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Nathan Furst, whose preferred composition style of grand orchestra and electronica {{was what the}} film's producers were looking for. Initially ignorant of the Bionicle universe, he explored the official website after getting the job as composer to get better context for his music. This <b>and</b> <b>discussions</b> he had with staff helped {{in the creation of}} eight or nine specific themes. The overall style is grand orchestral, but includes elements of electronic and tribal music. Furst used elements of African, Polynesian, and Eastern European music to communicate the fact that Mata Nui was an island, and when he could he incorporated his music into the action rather than leaving it as a standalone element within scenes.|$|E

5|$|Each of {{the seven}} books is set {{over the course of}} one school year. Harry struggles with the {{problems}} he encounters, and dealing with them often involves the need to violate some school rules. If students are caught breaking rules, they are often disciplined by Hogwarts professors. The stories reach their climax in the summer term, near or just after final exams, when events escalate far beyond in-school squabbles and struggles, and Harry must confront either Voldemort or one of his followers, the Death Eaters, with the stakes {{a matter of life and}} death – a point underlined, as the series progresses, by characters being killed in each of the final four books. In the aftermath, he learns important lessons through exposition <b>and</b> <b>discussions</b> with head teacher and mentor Albus Dumbledore. The only exception to this school-centred setting is the final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, in which Harry and his friends spend most of their time away from Hogwarts, and only return there to face Voldemort at the dénouement.|$|E
5|$|In {{designing}} puzzles, Barth {{wanted to}} keep puzzles open-ended, allowing the player {{to come to a}} solution without funneling them in a specific direction. The team designed puzzles based on general chemistry concepts without envisioning the specific solution that the player would take. They brainstormed a number of puzzles and then eliminated those with similar solutions, and arranged the others into a reasonable learning curve for the game. Despite this, Barth reflected that the tutorials provided to explain the game's mechanics had mixed responses, from some players who took up the concept easily to others that remained baffled as to the puzzle's goal even when instructions were set out step by step. In some cases, Barth discovered that players made assumptions on limitations of the game from these tutorials such as the idea that the red and blue waldos must remain in the separate halves of the screen. Based on the feedback that players had made on sites that hosted his previous Flash-based games, Barth designed the global-based histograms to allow players to check their solution without feeling overwhelmed by the top players as would be normally listed on a leaderboard. He also devised the means of sharing solutions through YouTube videos due to similar comments <b>and</b> <b>discussions</b> on the previous games.|$|E

St-Calais then asked for an appeal to Rome, which was rejected by the king and the judges. Those judging the case held that because St-Calais never answered the formal accusation, and because he appealed to Rome, his fief, or lands, was forfeit. Although St-Calais claimed to be defending the rights of clergy to be tried in clerical courts and to appeal to Rome, his fellow bishops believed otherwise. Lending support to their belief is the fact that St-Calais never pursued his appeal to Rome, and that later, in 1095, he took the side of the king against Anselm of Canterbury when Anselm tried to assert a right to appeal to Rome.|$|E
