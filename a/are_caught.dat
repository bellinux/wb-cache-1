5|$|As {{their name}} suggests, bee-eaters {{predominantly}} eat flying insects, especially bees and wasps, which <b>are</b> <b>caught</b> {{in the air}} by flights from an open perch.

5|$|Belugas {{were the}} first whales {{to be kept in}} captivity. Other species were too rare, too shy, or too big. The first beluga was shown at Barnum's Museum in New York City in 1861. For most of the 20th century, Canada was the {{predominant}} source of wild belugas. They were taken from the St. Lawrence River estuary until the late 1960s, after which they were predominantly taken from the Churchill River estuary until capture was banned in 1992. Russia has become the largest provider since it had been banned in Canada. Belugas <b>are</b> <b>caught</b> in the Amur River delta and their eastern coast, and then are either transported domestically to aquariums or dolphinariums in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Sochi, or exported to other countries, such as Canada. Most captive belugas <b>are</b> <b>caught</b> in the wild, since captive-breeding programs are not very successful.|$|E
5|$|Fighting beetles {{are used}} for {{entertainment}} and gambling. This sport exploits the territorial behavior and mating competition of certain species of large beetles. In the Chiang Mai district of northern Thailand, male Xylotrupes rhinoceros beetles <b>are</b> <b>caught</b> in the wild and trained for fighting. Females are held inside a log to stimulate the fighting males with their pheromones. These fights may be competitive and involve gambling both money and property. In South Korea the Dytiscidae species Cybister tripunctatus is used in a roulette-like game.|$|E
5|$|For some Native American tribes, dragonflies {{represent}} swiftness and activity; for the Navajo, they symbolize pure water.

5|$|From January until May, the Parrett {{provides}} {{a source of}} European eels (Anguilla anguilla) and young elvers, which <b>are</b> <b>caught</b> by hand netting as {{this is the only}} legal means of catching them. A series of eel passes have been built on the Parrett at the King's Sedgemoor Drain to help this endangered species; cameras have shown 10,000 eels migrating upstream in a single night. The 2003 BBC Radio 4 play Glass Eels by Nell Leyshon was set on the Parrett.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to commercial shark fisheries, dusky sharks are also caught as bycatch on longlines meant for tuna and swordfish (and usually kept for its valuable fins), and by recreational fishers. Large numbers of dusky sharks, mostly juveniles, <b>are</b> <b>caught</b> by sport fishers off South Africa and eastern Australia. This shark was {{once one of}} the most important species in the Florida trophy shark tournaments, before the population collapsed.|$|E

5000|$|An {{estimated}} 1 in 2 million lobsters are blue. A {{genetic mutation}} causes a blue lobster {{to produce an}} excessive amount of a particular protein. The protein and a red carotenoid molecule known as astaxanthin combine to form a blue complex known as crustacyanin, giving the lobster its blue color. In 2009 a blue lobster <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> in New Hampshire; in 2011, two blue lobsters <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> in Canada, one off of Prince Edward Island, and another in the EsgenoÃ´petitj First Nation territory in New Brunswick; another <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> in May 2012 off Nova Scotia. A blue lobster <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> off Pine Point in Scarborough, Maine in August 2014, and was donated to a local aquarium to join three other blue lobsters. In August, 2016, one <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> in Massachusetts {{off the coast of}} Cape Cod.

5|$|Large {{numbers of}} silky sharks <b>are</b> <b>caught</b> by {{commercial}} and artisanal multispecies shark fisheries operating off Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, the United States, Ecuador, Spain, Portugal, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Yemen, and CÃ´te d'Ivoire. Even greater numbers <b>are</b> <b>caught</b> incidentally by tuna longline and purse seine fisheries throughout its range, particularly those using fish aggregating devices. It {{is the most}} common shark caught as bycatch in the eastern Pacific and Gulf of Mexico tuna fisheries, and the second-most common shark caught as bycatch (next to the blue shark) overall. The fins are valued as an ingredient in shark fin soup, with captured sharks often finned at sea {{and the rest of the}} body discarded. Fins from an estimated one-half to one and a half million silky sharks are traded globally per year; it is the second- or third-most common species auctioned on the Hong Kong fin market, which represents over half the global trade. The meat (sold fresh or dried and salted), skin, and liver oil may also be used, as well as the jaws: this species is the predominant source of dried shark jaw curios sold to tourists in the tropics. Some sport fishers catch silky sharks.|$|E
