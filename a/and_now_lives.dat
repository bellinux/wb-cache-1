5|$|At a young age, Eloise asks Daniel if {{he knows}} what destiny is and then tells him {{that he has a}} special gift — his {{brilliant}} mind — and that his destiny relies on this. After Daniel graduates from Oxford University, Eloise gives him a new journal as a gift and again reminds him of his destiny. Meanwhile, Daniel has received an enormous research grant from Charles, who Daniel does not know is actually his father. Years later, following the crash of Flight 815, Daniel has suffered severe psychological effects from performing experiments on himself; he has lost his mental acuity, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>lives</b> with a caretaker. While watching the news coverage of the discovery of the Flight 815 wreckage in the Sunda Trench, Daniel is visited by Charles, who tells him that he faked the found wreckage and that the real plane actually landed on the island. Charles invites Daniel to go to the island, which Charles claims will cure his psychological problems. Eloise later visits Daniel and further encourages him to go to the island.|$|E
