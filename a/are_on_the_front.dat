25|$|When public administrators perform {{emotional}} labor, {{many scholars}} argue administrators {{are dealing with}} significantly more sensitive situations than employees in the service industry. The {{reason for this is}} because they <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> lines of the government, and are expected to by citizens to serve them quickly and efficiently. When confronted by a citizen or a co-worker public administrators use emotional sensing to size up the emotional state of the citizen in need. Workers then take stock of their own emotional state in order {{to make sure that the}} emotion they are expressing is appropriate to their roles. Simultaneously, they have to determine how to act in order to elicit the desired response from the citizen as well as from co-workers. Public Administrators perform emotional labor through five different strategies: Psychological First Aid, Compartments and Closets, Crazy Calm, Humor, and Common Sense.|$|E

The GT500 shared basic design characteristics {{with that of the}} Mustang V6 and GT. It retained the same basic live axle rear suspension setup of the Mustang V6 and GT, with some minor durability enhancements such as thicker sheetmetal supports and extra welds, as well as redesigned strut towers to accommodate a wider engine. The supercharged 5.4L 32-valve DOHC V8 engine with an iron block and aluminum heads was rated at 500hp (373kW) @ 6000rpm and 480lb·ft (650N·m) of torque @ 4500rpm.

The arms of the City of Lichfield <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the pedestal. The statue was erected during Edward's reign {{as a gesture of}} the city's loyalty to the King.

500|$|The All-China Women's Federation is {{run from}} the {{national}} level with the provincial, municipal, county, district and village levels below it. [...] However it is considered a nominal hierarchical structure because the Party controls each level {{over and above the}} jurisdiction of the ACWF. Instead of direct control, the higher levels provide guidance, ideas, and trainings to the levels below it. Some members have complained that women trained by the party are promoted more rapidly than women trained by the ACWF. Due to this perceived promotion rate, the grass roots members are incentivized to follow the demands of the party instead of the demands of the ACWF. Other members of the ACWF believe that the grassroots structure is successfully in touch with the women they are working for since they <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> lines of the movement, and see little problem with the disconnect between the upper levels of the party and grassroots levels.|$|E
500|$|The eastern {{green mamba}} is a large, with a {{slightly}} compressed, and very slender bodied snake with a medium to moderately long tapering tail. Adult males average around [...] in total length, while females average [...] in total length. This species rarely exceeds lengths of [...] In general, the total length is 4-4.3 times {{the length of the}} tail. The head is narrow, elongate, and coffin-shaped with a distinct canthus and slightly distinct from the neck. When threatened or otherwise aroused in some way, this species is capable of flattening its neck area, though no real hood formed. The eastern green mamba has relatively long front fangs located at proscenium end of the maxillary bone at the very front of the maxilla, which can rotate at its axis with the prefrontal bone, giving this species more control of the movements of their fangs, unlike other elapids. The maxillary bone has no other solid teeth. However, a pair of long, recurved, fang-like solid teeth, followed behind by a distinct interspace and numerous small teeth <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the lower jaw. Their eyes are medium in size with round pupils.|$|E

[...] Or, when one of Sister Shannon's fellow nuns asked why they could not receive the Magic Priests' training in the supernatural, she replied that {{it was for the}} same reason the Church forbids the ordination of women, something that causes controversy within the fictional Church of Warrior Nun Areala as it does in the real Church.|$|E
