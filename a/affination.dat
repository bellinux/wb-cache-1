5|$|The sugar may {{be transported}} in bulk {{to the country}} {{where it will be}} used and the {{refining}} process often takes place there. The first stage is known as <b>affination</b> and involves immersing the sugar crystals in a concentrated syrup that softens and removes the sticky brown coating without dissolving them. The crystals are then separated from the liquor and dissolved in water. The resulting syrup is treated either by a carbonatation or by a phosphatation process. Both involve the precipitation of a fine solid in the syrup and when this is filtered out, many of the impurities are removed at the same time. Removal of color is achieved by using either a granular activated carbon or an ion-exchange resin. The sugar syrup is concentrated by boiling and then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals, causing the sugar to crystallize out. The liquor is spun off in a centrifuge and the white crystals are dried in hot air and ready to be packaged or used. The surplus liquor is made into refiners' molasses.|$|E
25|$|After {{filtering}} {{any remaining}} solids, the clarified syrup is decolorized by filtration through activated carbon. Bone char or coal-based activated carbon is traditionally {{used in this}} role. Some remaining color-forming impurities adsorb to the carbon. The purified syrup is then concentrated to supersaturation and repeatedly crystallized in a vacuum, to produce white refined sugar. As in a sugar mill, the sugar crystals are separated from the molasses by centrifuging. Additional sugar is recovered by blending the remaining syrup with the washings from <b>affination</b> and again crystallizing to produce brown sugar. When no more sugar can be economically recovered, the final molasses still contains 2030 percent sucrose and 1525 percent glucose and fructose.|$|E
50|$|The {{raw sugar}} {{is stored in}} large {{warehouses}} and then transported into the sugar refinery by means of transport belts. In the traditional refining process, the raw sugar is first mixed with heavy syrup and centrifuged to wash away the outer coating of the raw sugar crystals, which is less pure than the crystal interior. Many sugar refineries today buy high pol sugar and can do without the <b>affination</b> process.|$|E
5000|$|Refiners' syrup {{begins as}} a high brix, pale sucrose syrup made from white sugar and water {{designed}} to loosen the dried molasses found on raw sugar crystals. The sucrose saturated content of the initial [...] "green" [...] syrup impedes sugar crystals from dissolving {{during the process of}} washing. The purpose is to mix the green syrup with raw sugar crystals to form a [...] "magma" [...] of 8-10% moisture content at around 60-65 degrees C that is then washed with water in a centrifuge. After the first washing (often termed <b>affination)</b> the [...] "washed off" [...] molasses combines with the sucrose syrup to generate refiners' return syrup, which is generally re-used several times until deemed spent. The spent refiners' return syrup is sold off to manufacturers for golden syrup production or is sent to a recovery section of the refinery often called the remelt house or boil-out section. Here it is reheated to crystallize and recover the sucrose it contains and that is returned to the <b>affination</b> stage. The final spent syrup left after the recovery process is sold as treacle (often called refiners' molasses in older texts).|$|E
50|$|Treacle is {{made from}} the syrup that remains after sugar is refined. Raw sugars are first treated in a process called <b>affination.</b> When dissolved, the {{resulting}} liquor contains the minimum of dissolved non-sugars to be removed by treatment with activated carbon or bone char. The dark-coloured washings are treated separately, without carbon or bone char. They are boiled to grain (i.e. until sugar crystals precipitate out) in a vacuum pan, forming a low-grade massecuite (boiled mass) which is centrifuged, yielding a brown sugar and a liquid by-product—treacle.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that in a sugar production, only about 80 % of sucrose, {{extracted}} from the beet, is output as a commercial product. The rest is lost during the processing or remains in intermediates. The color of white sugar is mainly determined {{by the color of}} the returned to the first stage of crystallization of the brown sugars melt. An effective way {{to improve the quality of}} melt is <b>affination</b> of brown sugars. Coloring substances are preferably present in the film on the surface of sugar crystals. To improve the efficiency of <b>affination</b> experiments were carried out by layer-by-layer processing of the normalized crystal size with the saturated solution of white sugar. To evaluate the numerical characteristics of the color of the samples studied scanerometrical method followed by computer processing of images in RGB color mode was used. The studies suggest that the solution of the starting yellow sugar having visual yellow color intensively absorbs 450 – 480 nm of spectrum, so there is no blue component in the graphs. During the <b>affination</b> removing of coloring substances from the surface of crystals takes place changing the light absorption intensity. There is a bleaching of the samples at <b>affination</b> duration up to 3 minutes. Further 5 – 10 min treatment is accompanied by partial diffusion of colorants from mother liquor to the surface of crystals and improved chromaticity. Prolonged <b>affination</b> results in crystals abrasion; it is accompanied by unproductive energy consumption on the mixing process. The results obtained indicate that the effective removal of coloring substances occurs within 1 – 3 minutes of <b>affination.</b> In this case brown sugar chromaticity decreases from 625 to 130 – 230 units of optical density and mother liquor chromaticity is increased from 20 to 900 – 1600 units of optical density. The studies suggest that most of the coloring substances determining the chromaticity of yellow sugars is found in the film on the crystal surface and is easily removed by 3 min long <b>affination.</b> Method of determining of objects color characteristics in RGB system describes adequately the intermediates coloring of sugar production and can be used in research...|$|E
30|$|Carbon {{decolorization}} still extensively {{applied in}} the field of food production such as sugar refining to remove color precursors from different types of juice (Bourzutsckky 2005; Chou 2010). The reactions that take place during the production are the main reason for such colored compounds in the sugar manufacturing. Furthermore, {{it is not possible to}} determine the chemical structure of the relevant coloring compounds and difficult to control in many cases. Melanin, melanoidins and caramel types are the most proper colored components formed during sugar carbonation process (Singh et al. 2011). There are twenty-one phenolic compounds in the cane sugar plantation according to Farber and Carpenter, who also reported, four colored types in refined sugar, and nearly ten in raw sugar (Farber and Carpenter 1971). Moreover, the red-colored quinones, indole and melanin derivatives, result from the oxidation of phenolic compounds. Therefore, we can conclude that the polyphenols are responsible for color formation in sugar processing (Gross and Coombs 1976). With increasing energy costs related to the sugar production and environmental impacts, it is highly important to re-estimate the old decolorization technologies with respect to their virtues. These techniques include <b>affination,</b> carbonation or phosphatation that are classified as a primary decolorization stage, and secondary expensive decolorization technique-based ion-exchange resins (Singh et al. 2011). Moreover, treatment with hydrogen peroxide or sulfur dioxide have some toxic effect overdose; therefore, to produce high juice clarity and good-quality white sugar products, a new cost-reduction material used for treatment of juice like powdered activated carbon is developed (van der Poel et al. 1998).|$|E
40|$|The oyster culture, flourishing {{along the}} Belgian coast at the {{beginning}} of the century, perished entirely in the course of two World Wars. In 1956, it was taken on again intensively in the Scour Basin of Ostend. If we consider the obtained results with the <b>affination</b> of Flat and Portuguese oyster, this 86 ha closed basin, is of an exceptional productivity. Essays on the understanding of the origin of calcified oysters, done from 1960 until 1966, turned out to be very promising and an integral oyster culture from the larvae up to the adult oyster could be observed. In any case the last few years, eventhough compared to before a normal emission of larvae of Ostrea edulis, there has not been a fixation of the origin. Regular samples of plankton, effected from June until August, in 1969 and in 1970, revealed that the offspring of the Flat Oyster showed no growing, while the larvae of other bivalve species in the Scour Bassin, like Mytilus, Mya and Cardium, grew normally. Experiences of artificial oyster cultures in laboratory, effected in 1969 and in 1970, showed the same absence of growth when larvae were placed in water originating from the Scour basin, while in sea water originating from elsewhere, the offspring the stage of metamorphose of larvae was reached within 10 days. Possible causes for the unsuccessfulness are discussed in detail. We can deduce that the responsible factor would be of toxic order, and that its origin can most probably be found in the ever-growing pollution in the harbour of Ostend, which water feeds the Scour basin...|$|E
