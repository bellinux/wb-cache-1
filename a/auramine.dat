50|$|Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} is an obligate pathogenic bacterial {{species in}} the family Mycobacteriaceae and the causative agent of tuberculosis. First discovered in 1882 by Robert Koch, M. tuberculosis has an unusual, waxy coating on its cell surface primarily due {{to the presence of}} mycolic acid. This coating makes the cells impervious to Gram staining, and as a result, M. tuberculosis can appear either Gram-negative or Gram-positive. Acid-fast stains such as Ziehl-Neelsen, or fluorescent stains such as <b>auramine</b> are used instead to identify M. tuberculosis with a microscope. The physiology of M. tuberculosis is highly aerobic and requires high levels of oxygen. Primarily a pathogen of the mammalian respiratory system, it infects the lungs. The most frequently used diagnostic methods for tuberculosis are the tuberculin skin test, acid-fast stain, culture, and polymerase chain reaction.|$|E
40|$|The {{fluorescence}} of the cation <b>auramine</b> O was substantially {{enhanced by}} the presence of actin monomer. Titrations of this fluorescence enhancement indicated that actin monomer had two <b>auramine</b> O binding sites, each with a dissociation constant of approx. 20 microM. Calcium ions had no effect on the number of actin monomer-bound <b>auramine</b> O molecules or on the dissociation constant for that interaction. However, calcium ions increased the maximum change of fluorescence that occurs when actin monomer was fully saturated with <b>auramine</b> O. This effect of calcium was saturable and yielded a Ca 2 + dissociation constant of 1. 6 mM. It was concluded that <b>auramine</b> O bound to sites on actin monomer and independently monitored the binding of Ca 2 + ion(s) to other site(s) on actin monomer. Further, the magnitude of the Ca 2 + dissociation constant suggested that this Ca 2 +-binding site may be representative of the multiple bivalent cation-binding sites on actin monomer which are thought to be directly involved in actin polymerization.

We did a pilot study to compare the diagnostic accuracy and incremental yield of two short-duration (, 1 hour) sputum pretreatment procedures to optimize direct smears among patients with suspected TB at a referral hospital in India. Methodology/Findings: Blinded laboratory comparison of bleach and universal sediment processing (USP) pretreated centrifuged <b>auramine</b> smears to direct Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) and direct <b>auramine</b> smears and to solid (Loweinstein-Jensen (LJ)) and liquid (BACTEC 460) culture. 178 pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB suspects were prospectively recruited during a one year period.

40|$|Background: Microbial {{examination}} of smear of AFB by Z-N stain {{is currently the}} most rapid method {{for the detection of}} M. tuberculosis but its sensitivity is low i. e. required at least 10, 000 bacterial cells per ml of sputum and also none specific, but <b>auramine</b> staining method has higher sensitivity than that of the Z-N stain but there are chances of false positive. Objective {{of this study was to}} find the correlation between chest X-ray, direct sputum smear examination by Ziehl-Neelsen stain, <b>Auramine</b> fluorochrome stain and sputum culture for M. tuberculosis. Methods: During that study period 250 x 3 samples were taken three each from 250 patients and divided into two groups A and B by performing <b>Auramine</b> fluorochrome stain in all samples. In group A, there were 150 fluorochrome stain positive samples.

40|$|SETTING: Mawenzi Regional Hospital, {{northern}} Tanzania. OBJECTIVE: To {{determine the}} value of light-emitting diode (LED) microscopy in diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) on bleach-treated and direct sputum smears. DESIGN: Sputum samples were collected from patients suspected of pulmonary TB who presented consecutively at the laboratory for smear evaluation between December 2009 and February 2010. Four smears were prepared from each specimen: conventional Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN), direct <b>auramine,</b> bleach centrifugation and bleach short sedimentation <b>auramine</b> smears. A light microscope {{was used to examine}} ZN smears and an LED fluorescent microscope to examine auramine-stained smears. RESULTS: Of the 267 sputum samples examined, respectively 78 (29 %), 62 (23 %), 74 (28 %) and 48 (18 %) were acid-fast bacilli (AFB) positive by the bleach centrifugation, bleach short sedimentation, direct <b>auramine</b> and ZN methods. Bleach centrifugation identified 30 (11 %) more positives than ZN microscopy (P < 0. 001), but was not superior to the direct <b>auramine</b> method (P = 0. 46), which yielded 26 (10 %) more positives than ZN microscopy (P < 0. 001).

40|$|The role of {{confinement}} in {{the suppression}} of the excited-state reaction of the dye molecule <b>auramine</b> O in nanoscale water droplets is investigated by contrasting the behavior of the dye in solution and on regular and reverse micelles. <b>Auramine</b> O photophysics are studied in bulk water, at the interface between regular micelles and bulk water, and in the aerosol OT (AOT) -stabilized aqueous nanodroplet. It is shown that the reaction of <b>auramine</b> O in bulk water is to a first approximation determined by aqueous solvation dynamics rather than solvent viscosity. This is in contrast to the result in more viscous and slowly relaxing solvents, where the solvent viscosity controls the rate. This result suggests the possibility of multiple reaction pathways on the excited-state surface. The reaction rate at the regular micelle-water interface is slower than in bulk water but significantly faster than in nanoconfined water, indicating a distinct effect of confinement on the reaction rate. It is suggested that the degree of perturbation of the water structure at the interface is the factor controlling the rate of the reaction. Specifically, the water structure is strongly perturbed at the AOT-confined water interface, suppressing the ability of fast collective solvent reorientation to promote the <b>auramine</b> O excited-state reaction. This effect is less marked at the interface between the micelle and bulk water. The contrast between these results indicates a route whereby confinement modifies ultrafast reaction dynamics in micelles...|$|E
