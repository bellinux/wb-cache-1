During annual inventories in 2011 and 2013, hundreds of scientists and thousands of volunteers identified 389 species of vascular plants, 25 of non-vascular plants, and 197 species of fungi in Saguaro National Park.|$|E

25|$|Since higher {{education}} is funded by the state, the fees are very low; tuition fees vary from €150 to €700 depending on {{the university and the}} different levels of education (licence, master, doctorate). One can therefore get a master's degree (in 5 years) for about €750–3,500. The tuition fees in public engineering schools are comparable to universities, albeit <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>higher</b> (around €700). However they can reach €7000 a year for private engineering schools, while business schools, which are all private or partially private, charge up to €15000 a year. Health insurance for students is free until the age of 20.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the climate}} varied {{depending}} on altitude and thus {{there were differences}} in the potential value of the land, the property lines were drawn along {{the slope of the}} hills so as to benefit each descendant in a complete and equitable fashion: flat, easy-access land in the plains near the royal roads and the sea; land for farming and cultivation halfway up; and, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>higher,</b> land planted with trees for building or burning. In turn, the intermediary level was divided in three parts, each with a distinct function: the lowest was used for subsistence farming, the middle for coffee plantations and the highest for animal husbandry.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no single}} yield curve {{describing}} the cost of money for everybody. The {{most important factor in}} determining a yield curve is the currency in which the securities are denominated. The economic position of the countries and companies using each currency is a primary factor in determining the yield curve. Different institutions borrow money at different rates, depending on their creditworthiness. The yield curves corresponding to the bonds issued by governments in their own currency are called the government bond yield curve (government curve). Banks with high credit ratings (Aa/AA or above) borrow money from each other at the LIBOR rates. These yield curves are typically <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>higher</b> than government curves. They are the most important and widely used in the financial markets, and are known variously as the LIBOR curve or the swap curve. The construction of the swap curve is described below.|$|E
25|$|In 1832 Dr Thomas Lloyd, a Ludlow {{doctor and}} amateur geologist, met Roderick Murchison at Ludford Corner {{to study the}} rocks exposed along the River Teme and on Whitcliffe, {{advancing}} Murchison's theory for a Silurian System {{that he was to}} publish in 1839. Immediately above the topmost layer of the marine rock sequence forming Murchison's Silurian period was a thin layer of dark sand containing numerous remains of early fish, especially their scales, along with plant debris, spores and microscopic mites. In contrast to the underlying sediments of the Ludlow Series which were deposited in a shallow warm sea some 400 million years ago, the Ludlow Bone Bed represents terrestrial (land) conditions and thus a fundamental change in the landscape. At the time, this was believed to be the earliest occurrence of life on land. Murchison thus took the Ludlow Bone Bed as the base of his Devonian Period, although over a century later this boundary was to be moved <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>higher,</b> the overlying rocks being ascribed to the Pridoli.
