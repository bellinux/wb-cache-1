5000|$|Following the [...] "merger" [...] with Leyland, the new company's board bore {{an uncanny}} {{resemblance}} to the senior management team that had hitherto headed up the Leyland half of the partnership, so comments of the management team on the profitability of the former BMC elements need to be viewed with caution. However, following a review of company records undertaken {{with the support of}} the new board, author Graham Turner stated that at the time of the merger, 16 versions of the Mini were being produced, yielding an average profit of just £16 per car, while every Morris Minor sold lost the group £9 and every Austin Westminster sold lost £17. This helps to explain why the Westminster and Minor were among the early casualties of the merger, as well as the introduction of the Mini Clubman, capable of being built for less, but sold for more than a standard Mini thanks to simplified ("modernised") front panels. Even the UK's best seller, the Austin/Morris 1100, had to be subjected to an emergency cost-reduction programme which removed about £10 from the cost of each car, applying changes that included the omission of lead sealing from body joints (£2.40 per car), removing provision for optional reversing lamps (£0.10) and [...] "changes in body finish" [...] (£0.75). Rebuilding the Cowley plant to include [...] "new automated body building facilities" [...] saved £2.00 in transport costs per car for bodies that no longer needed to be transported from the corporation's Swindon plant and in the longer term further transport costs were saved by concentrating assembly of the model at a single plant, rather than splitting it between plants at Cowley and Longbridge. Because of the high proportion of auto-production costs represented by fixed costs that needed to be allocated over a planned production volume, and the use in the 1960s of investment <b>appraisal</b> <b>criteria</b> that were ill-suited to accounting for volume fluctuations and the rapidly changing value of the UK currency in the 1960s, the precise figures quoted may be open to challenge, but the new management's diagnosis that BMC's profitability was insufficient to fund support and new model investment to cover its disparate range of brands and models was hard to refute.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{reflection}} on evolutionary technological change and economic growth theory, which starts from the Lakatosian methodology of scientific research programmes (MSRP) as an <b>appraisal</b> <b>criterion.</b> As the persistence of some inflexibility on the approach made difficult to capture fundamental features of that scientific endeavour, it was undertaken an analysis using an alternative framework developed by Hoover (1991).

30|$|The term “reliability” {{describes}} the replicability {{and thus the}} accuracy with which each item measures its intended trait. To assess a student’s expertise, a measure must have a strong probability of correctly classifying each student as possessing a certain competence value. For this analysis, we again applied an IRT standard. An important characteristic of IRT models is that they describe reliability, in terms of measurement precision, as a continuous function that is conditional on {{the values of the}} measured construct. It is therefore possible to model the test’s reliability for each individual value of competence for every test taker. The crucial <b>appraisal</b> <b>criterion</b> for a test’s reliability is measurement error, which arises because any measurement concept can include only a limited sample of the many possible items that constitute the measurement domain. The testing conditions also may vary, because factors other than student knowledge affect response behaviors, including both student-specific factors, such as mood, health, or individual differences in exposure to the tested content, and situational factors, such as distractions during the test, room temperature, and so forth (Kiplinger, 2008).|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{psychometric properties of}} a measure of adolescents' <b>appraisal</b> of <b>criteria</b> used for judging their {{sport and physical education}} success by their significant adults (PACEDOS). To facilitate coherent comparisons among significant adults in achievement settings, the same measure was used for the four of them (mother, father, and coach or PE teacher). Participants were 505 Spanish adolescents (M= 13. 85 years of age, SD =. 76). Support for two dimensions, namely a task-involving criteria and ego-involving criteria, emerged across the four administrations via CFA, as well as evidence for internal consistency. Predictive validity findings suggested that the PACEDOS was distinct from perceptions of the motivational climate. Results revealed differences in gender, between athletes/non-athletes, and among the adolescents' appraisals of the four social agents' ego and task-involving criteria. Particularly, parents played a gendered role and sport leaders (coach/PE teacher) played a performative/educational role in adolescents' <b>appraisal</b> of the <b>criteria</b> used for judging their success in sport and PE contexts. The PACEDOS appeared to be a valid and reliable instrument, which allows coherent comparisons among different significant adults and it may help for understanding adolescents' sport and PE socialization...|$|R

40|$|The problem studied {{was whether}} {{supervisors}} evaluated telecommuters differently than their on-site co-workers and, if they did, was this difference explainable by the models on performance ratings by Landy and Farr (1980, 1983, 1989) ? For this study, telecommuting referred to {{employees who are}} full-time employees, but work off-site using electronic communication devices and telecommuted {{at least one day}} per week. Twenty organizations nation-wide were surveyed. Hypotheses stated that {{there was no difference in}} supervisory performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>criteria,</b> supervisory performance ratings whether the supervisor selected employees to telecommute or the supervisor telecommuted or not, and the frequency between formal performance appraisals for telecommuters and non-telecommuters. Performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>criteria</b> and other questions concerning the evaluation process were analyzed. The data supported the first hypothesis of no difference in performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>criteria</b> used to evaluate telecommuters and non-telecommuters. The second hypothesis was not supported by the data. The three groups disagreed that telecommuters were generally better performers than their on-site co-workers. Supervisors and telecommuters disagreed on their perceptions of telecommuters as rated as better employees. It was assumed in the third hypothesis that supervisors who themselves telecommuted would not rate telecommuters as better employees than their co-workers. Due to the small sample size, the results were inconclusive. In the fourth hypothesis, it was assumed that supervisors who had the final say about who would be eligible to telecommute would not perceive telecommuters as better employees. Based on the analysis, the hypothesis could not be supported or refuted due to the small sample size. Finally, the fifth hypothesis relied on measuring the number of months between formal reviews to determine if telecommuters were evaluated more frequently than their onsi te co-workers. The analysis verified that there was no difference between the two groups. Because no prior research has been conducted about differences in evaluating telecommuting and nontelecommuting employees, there is no data available for comparison purposes to discover any trends or changes. Future research on this subject should include a review of actual performance appraisal records to determine if differences in ratings for telecommuters and nontelecommuters exists...|$|E

40|$|Stanisław Borowski was a scientist, who {{combined}} integrally competences {{of economic}} historian, demographer and economist. Thanks to methodological and theoretical values He {{joined the group}} of best Polish historians and demographers. The Wielkopolska region, considered often with Pomerania and Silesia together, was a main subject and field of research for Professor Borowski, allowing to investigate and to verify regularities of socio-economic and demographic development. S. Borowski started His scientific output with an extensive study devoted to development of labour mechanization in Wielkopolska agriculture in the years 1823 - 1918. Further research aimed at exploration {{of social and economic}} action allowing to explain changes in agriculture and situation of peasants in Wielkopolska in the 19 -th century. The first place was then occupied by research on influence of incorporating the country in the sphere of market. S. Borowski published two voluminous books on that subject. They significantly enriched our knowledge about the Wielkopolska's country and agriculture in the 19 -th century. Simultaneously demographic structure of Wielkopolska in the course of ages was examined by S. Borowski. Demographic changes were always explained in the light of historic events {{and in the course of}} phenomena examination in their long-run development. The research pivot is showing and explaining processes of transition from traditional pre-industrial population development model to a modern model, and so analysis of demographic revolution. In that context S. Borowski examined among others factors that determined the process of dying out, questions of emigration from the Polish lands under German sector in the 19 -th century and demographic development of Wielkopolska from the end of the 16 -th to the 20 -th century. A few studies were devoted to methodological considerations on statistical sources. They are original thoughts, still having their full inspirational value. Particularly, penetration in analysis of <b>appraisal</b> <b>criterions</b> of statistical sources should be underlined. S. Borowski was a modern scientist.

40|$|Various {{authors have}} scrutinised the sole {{utilisation}} of quantifiable (financial) <b>appraisal</b> <b>criteria</b> in capital investment appraisal. They {{argue that the}} appraisal of capital investment proposals must concentrate on the capital investment process {{as a whole and}} not only on the selection phase. These authors suggest that capital investment opportunities and proposals must be sought within the parameters set by strategy. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to explore and to describe how decision-makers in the platinum industry experience the influence of competitive strategy on the capital investment process. Semi-structured interviews were held with strategic capital investment decision-makers within a major role player in the platinum industry. Respondents were selected according to the snowball sampling method. An analysis of the results indicates that competitive strategy does influence the capital investment process.

40|$|Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) is {{a method}} for writing {{personalized}} evaluation scales to quantify progress toward defined rehabilitation goals. In the published literature, GAS methodology is used with different levels of rigor, ranging from precisely written GAS scales that ensure minimal bias and explicitly describe 5 levels of goal attainment to subjective ratings of goal attainment by adjectives (eg, worse/better than expected), which are transformed into a T score, wrongly giving the reader {{the impression of a}} truly standardized, interval scale. A drawback of GAS methodology is that it is highly dependent on the ability of the GAS setting team/person to generate valid, reliable, and meaningful scales; therefore, reliability and validity of GAS scales are idiosyncratic to each study.
