40|$|Accurate {{information}} of ice sheet surface slope {{is essential for}} estimating elevation change by satellite altimetry measurement. A study is carried out to recover surface slope of <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ice</b> sheet from <b>Ice,</b> <b>Cloud</b> and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) elevation measurements based on repeat orbits. ICESat provides repeat ground tracks within 200 meters in cross-track direction and 170 meters in along-track direction for most areas of <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ice</b> sheet. Both cross-track and along-track surface slopes could be obtained by adjacent repeat ground tracks. Combining those measurements yields a surface slope model with resolution of approximately 200 meters. An algorithm considering elevation change is developed to estimate the surface slope of <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ice</b> sheet. Three <b>Antarctic</b> Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) were used to calculate surface slopes. The surface slopes from DEMs are compared with estimates by using in situ GPS data in Dome A, the summit of <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ice</b> sheet. Our results reveal an average surface slope difference of 0. 02 degree in Dome A. High resolution remote sensing images are also used in comparing the results derived from other DEMs and this paper. The comparison implies that our results have a slightly better coherence with GPS observation than results from DEMs, but our results provide more details and perform higher accuracy in coastal areas because of the higher resolution for ICESat measurements. Ice divides are estimated based on the aspect, and are weakly consistent with ice divides from other method in coastal regions...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Small {{perturbations}} in Antarctic {{environmental conditions}} can culminate in {{the demise of}} the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ice</b> sheet's western sector. This may have happened during the last interglacial period, and could recur within the next millennium due to atmospheric warming from trace gas and CO 2 increases. In this study, we investigate the importance of sea-level, accumulation rate, and ice influx from the East <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ice</b> sheet in the re-establishment of the West <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ice</b> sheet from a thin cover using a time-dependent numerical ice-shelf model. Our results show that a precursor to the West <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ice</b> sheet can form within 3000 years. Sea-level lowering caused by ice-sheet development in the Northern Hemisphere has the greatest environmental influence. Under favorable conditions, ice grounding occurs over all parts of the West <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ice</b> sheet except up-stream of Thwaites Glacier and in the Ross Sea region...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} few decades the Greenland and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ice</b> sheets have lost ice at {{accelerating}} rates, caused by increasing surface temperature. The melting of the two big ice sheets has a big impact on global sea level rise. If the ice sheets would melt down entirely, the sea level would rise more than 60  m. Even a much smaller rise would cause dramatic damage along coastal regions. In this paper we report about a major upgrade of surface elevation changes derived from laser altimetry data, acquired by NASA’s <b>Ice,</b> <b>Cloud</b> and land Elevation Satellite mission (ICESat) and airborne laser campaigns, such as Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) and Land, Vegetation and Ice Sensor (LVIS). For detecting changes in ice sheet elevations we have developed the Surface Elevation Reconstruction And Change detection (SERAC) method. It computes elevation changes of small surface patches by keeping the surface shape constant and considering the absolute values as surface elevations. We report about important upgrades of earlier results, for example the inclusion of local ice caps and the temporal extension from 1993 to 2014 for the Greenland Ice Sheet and for a comprehensive reconstruction of ice thickness and mass changes for the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Ice</b> Sheets...|$|R

50|$|Between 20,000 and 9,000 {{calendar}} years ago, {{this study}} documented eight well-defined periods of increased iceberg Ice calving and discharge from {{various parts of}} the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Ice</b> Sheet. The highest period of discharge of icebergs recorded in both cores is known as AID6 (Antarctic Iceberg Discharge event 6). AID6 has a relatively abrupt onset at about 15,000 calendar years ago. The peak interval of greatest iceberg discharge and flux from the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Ice</b> sheet for AID6 is between about 14,800 and 14,400 calendar years ago. The peak discharge is followed by gradual decline in flux until 13,900 calendar years ago, when it abruptly ends. The peak period of iceberg discharge for AID6 is synchronous with the onset of the Bølling interstadial in the Northern Hemisphere meltwater pulse 1A. Weber and others estimated that the flux of icebergs from Antarctica during AID6 contributed a substantial (at least 50%) to the global mean sea-level rise that occurred during meltwater pulse 1A. These icebergs came from the widespread retreat of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Ice</b> Sheet at this time, including from the Mac Robertson Land region of the East <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Ice</b> Sheet; the Ross Sea sector of the West <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Ice</b> Sheet; and the <b>Antarctic</b> Peninsula <b>Ice</b> Sheet.|$|R
40|$|Representation of <b>ice</b> <b>clouds</b> in {{radiative}} transfer simulations {{is subject to}} uncertainties associated with the shapes and sizes of ice crystals within cirrus clouds. In this study, we examined several <b>ice</b> <b>cloud</b> models consisting of smooth, roughened, homogeneous and inhomogeneous hexagonal ice crystals with various aspect ratios. The sensitivity of the bulk scattering properties and solar reflectances of cirrus <b>clouds</b> to specific <b>ice</b> <b>cloud</b> models is investigated using the improved geometric optics method (IGOM) and the discrete ordinates {{radiative transfer}} (DISORT) model. The ice crystal habit fractions in the <b>ice</b> <b>cloud</b> model may significantly affect the simulations of cloud reflectances.

40|$|This study investigates and {{accounts}} for the influence of various <b>ice</b> <b>cloud</b> parameters on the retrieval of the surface solar radiation budget (SSRB) from reflected flux {{at the top of}} the atmosphere (TOA). The optical properties of <b>ice</b> <b>clouds</b> depend on <b>ice</b> crystal shape, size distribution, water content, and the vertical profiles of geometric and microphysical structure. As a result, the relationship between the SSRB and TOA-reflected flux for an <b>ice</b> <b>cloud</b> atmosphere is more complex and differs from that for water cloud and cloudless atmospheres. The sensitivities of the relationship between the SSRB and TOA-reflected flux are examined with respect to various <b>ice</b> <b>cloud</b> parameters. Uncertainties in the retrieval of the SSRB due to inadequate knowledge of various <b>ice</b> <b>cloud</b> parameters are evaluated thoroughly. The uncertainty study is concerned with both pure <b>ice</b> <b>clouds</b> and multiphase <b>clouds</b> (<b>ice</b> <b>cloud</b> above water cloud). According to the magnitudes of errors in the SSRB retrieval caused by different input variables, parameterized correction terms were introduced. If the input variables are known accurately, errors in the retrieval of the SSRB under a wide range of <b>ice</b> <b>cloud</b> conditions are expected to diminish substantially, to less than 10 W m− 2 for 91 % of the simulated <b>ice</b> <b>cloud</b> cases.

40|$|The {{resilience}} of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Ice</b> Sheet {{and its effect}} on global sea level depends on the dynamics of <b>ice</b> streams. <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ice</b> streams are known to be responsive to changes at the ocean interface and, as expected, most have thinned in response to ocean warming and sea-level rise since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Here we provide direct and unexpected evidence that points toward the glacial/interglacial stability of the Slessor and Recovery glaciers, ice streams of the East <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Ice</b> Sheet (EAIS) which merge with the West <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Ice</b> Sheet (WAIS) to form the Filchner Ice Shelf in the Weddell Sea embayment. Cosmogenic-nuclide measurements in the Shackleton Range suggest that the Slessor and Recovery ice streams were not significantly thicker than today during the LGM. We hypothesise that the glaciers did not thicken because the grounding line was not able to migrate seaward beyond the deep Thiel/Crary Trough beneath the Filchner Ice Shelf immediately offshore. This discovery reveals how a topographic threshold can affect the dynamics of ice streams. It also reduces uncertainties on the thickness, extent and volume of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Ice</b> Sheet in a large but unknown sector of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Ice</b> Sheet; it constrains the potential sea-level rise from Antarctica; it helps explain observed anomalies in glacio-isostatic adjustment; above all it suggests that the behaviour of the Atlantic-facing Weddell Sea sector of the WAIS contrasts with that of the Pacific-facing Ross and Amundsen Sea sectors...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} effects of {{changing}} two sliding parameters, a deformational velocity parameter and two bedrock deflection parameters {{on the evolution of}} the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ice</b> sheet over the period from the last interglacial until the present. These sensitivity experiments have been conducted by running the dynamic ice model ANICE forward in time. The temporal climatological forcing is established by interpolating between two temporal climate states created with a regional climate model. The interpolation is done {{in such a way that}} both temperature and surface mass balance follow the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA) Dome C ice-core proxy record for temperature. We have determined an optimal set of parameter values, for which a realistic grounding-line retreat history and present-day ice sheet can be simulated; the simulation with this set of parameter values is defined as the reference simulation. An increase of sliding with respect to this reference simulation leads to a decrease of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ice</b> volume due to enhanced ice velocities on mainly the West <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ice</b> sheet. The effect of changing the deformational velocity parameter mainly yields a change in east <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ice</b> volume. Furthermore, we have found a minimum in the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ice</b> volume during the mid-Holocene, in accordance with observations. This is a robust feature in our model results, where the strength and the timing of this minimum are both dependent on the investigated parameters. More sliding and a slower responding bedrock lead to a stronger minimum which emerges at an earlier time. From the model results, we conclude that the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ice</b> sheet has contributed 10. 7 +/- 1. 3 m of eustatic sea level to the global ocean from the last glacial maximum (about 16 ka for the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ice</b> sheet) until the present...|$|R
