40|$|A {{considerable}} part {{of tissue}} samples that are collected for the monitoring of {{classical swine fever}} (CSF) from the wild boar population or from domestic pigs are unsuitable for virus detection using the fluorescent antibody test (FAT) or virus isolation (VI), due to tissue degradation. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has a higher sensitivity than the FAT and VI, and {{is supposed to be}} less sensitive to sample degradation. Reliable and quantitative information on how long viral RNA and infectious virus can be detected in organs and which organs are most susceptible to degradation is, however, lacking. In the present study we generated survival curves of infectious CSF virus (CSFV) and viral RNA in the tonsil, mesenteric lymph node, spleen and kidney, obtained from 24 pigs infected with a moderately virulent CSFV strain. Tissue samples were stored at room temperature and tested by VI and RT-PCR, directly after storage and 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14 and 21 days later. It was shown that the RT-PCR is not only more sensitive than VI on fresh tissue samples, but RT-PCR is also less vulnerable to sample degradation.

40|$|Publis 013 -agap- 074 The {{ability to}} {{assimilate}} C and allocate non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) {{to the most}} <b>appropriate</b> <b>organs</b> is crucial to maximize plant ecological or agronomic performance. Such C source and sink activities are differentially affected by environmental constraints. Under drought, plant growth is generally more sink than source limited as organ expansion or appearance rate is earlier and stronger affected than C assimilation. This favors plant survival and recovery but not always agronomic performance as NSC are stored rather than used for growth due to a modified metabolism in source and sink leaves. Such interactions between plant C and water balance are complex and plant modeling can help analyzing their impact on plant phenotype. This paper addresses the impact of trade-offs between C sink and source activities and plant production under drought, combining experimental and modeling approaches. Two contrasted monocotyledonous species (rice, oil palm) were studied. Experimentally, the sink limitation of plant growth under moderate drought was confirmed {{as well as the}} modifications in NSC metabolism in source and sink organs. Under severe stress, when C source became limiting, plant NSC concentration decreased. Two plant models dedicated to oil palm and rice morphogenesis were used to perform a sensitivity analysis and further explore how to optimize C sink and source drought sensitivity to maximize plant growth. Modeling results highlighted that optimal drought sensitivity depends both on drought type and species and that modeling is a great opportunity to analyze such complex processes. Further modeling needs and more generally the challenge of using models to support complex trait breeding are discussed...|$|E

During the treatment, two subsequent CTs at the 15 th (CT 15) and 25 th (CT 25) fractions were acquired. The initial plan was calculated on the CT 15 and CT 25, and dose-volume differences related to the CT plan were assessed. For target volumes, mean values of near-maximun absorbed dose (D 2 %) increased at the 25 th fraction, and doses covering 95 % and 98 % of volume decreased significantly at the 15 th fraction. Contralateral and ipsilateral parotid gland mean doses increased by 6. 1 % (range: − 5. 4, 23. 5 %) and 4. 7 % (range: − 9. 1, 22. 3 %), respectively, at CT 25.

40|$|SummaryPatterning of the {{primitive}} foregut promotes <b>appropriate</b> <b>organ</b> specification along its anterior-posterior axis. However, the molecular pathways specifying foregut endoderm progenitors are poorly understood. We show here that Wnt 2 / 2 b signaling {{is required to}} specify lung endoderm progenitors within the anterior foregut. Embryos lacking Wnt 2 / 2 b expression exhibit complete lung agenesis and do not express Nkx 2. 1, the earliest marker of the lung endoderm. In contrast, other foregut endoderm-derived organs, including the thyroid, liver, and pancreas, are correctly specified. The phenotype observed is recapitulated by an endoderm-restricted deletion of β-catenin, demonstrating that Wnt 2 / 2 b signaling through the canonical Wnt pathway is required to specify lung endoderm progenitors within the foregut. Moreover, activation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling results in the reprogramming of esophagus and stomach endoderm to a lung endoderm progenitor fate. Together, these data reveal that canonical Wnt 2 / 2 b signaling {{is required for the}} specification of lung endoderm progenitors in the developing foregut...|$|R

In mice, gain-of-function experiments have demonstrated that activation of the canonical Wnt pathway results in pancreatic hypoplasia, a phenomenon whose underlying mechanisms remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that ectopic activation of epithelial canonical Wnt signaling causes aberrant induction of gastric and intestinal markers both in the pancreatic epithelium and mesenchyme, leading to the development of gut-like features. Furthermore, we provide evidence that β -catenin-induced impairment of pancreas formation depends on Hedgehog signaling. Together, our data emphasize the developmental plasticity of pancreatic progenitors and further underscore the key role of precise regulation of signaling pathways to maintain <b>appropriate</b> <b>organ</b> boundaries...|$|R

30|$|Determining how {{multicellular}} organisms attain {{and maintain}} <b>appropriate</b> <b>organ</b> size has plagued researchers and remains a major quest. Studies employing genetic mosaic screens in Drosophila melanogaster shed {{new light on}} this question and identified the core components {{of what is now}} known as the Hippo signaling pathway, appropriately named after Hippo kinase. Mutant flies genetically deficient for a functional Hippo (Hpo) [1]-[5], Salvador (Sav) [6],[7] or Warts (Wts) [8],[9] exhibited similar phenotypes consisting of robust tissue overgrowth, enhanced cell proliferation and suppressed apoptosis. These shared phenotypes suggested the involvement of each in a common signaling cascade that regulated organ size, which was subsequently demonstrated through additional genetic and protein interaction studies. Integral work revealed that Hippo (a serine/threonine kinase) interacts with Salvador (a WW-repeat protein and scaffold) and promotes the phosphorylation of both Salvador and Warts kinase [1]. A fourth core component, Mats (Mob as tumor suppressor) is also phosphorylated by Hippo and was found {{to play an important role}} in this cascade by interacting with Warts, which may further facilitate Warts activation [10],[11]. These seminal studies demonstrated how the association and phosphorylation between core components promoted Hippo pathway activation.|$|R

RAP 2. 6 L functions in shoot regeneration because T-DNA knockdown mutations in the gene reduced the efficiency of shoot formation in tissue culture, but not normal embryo or seedling development. RAP 2. 6 L promoter:β-glucuronidase fusions demonstrated that the up-regulation of the gene during shoot regeneration was, at least in part, transcriptionally controlled. The promoter:β-glucuronidase fusions also demonstrated that RAP 2. 6 L expression was localized to the shoot and emerging leaves, but expression declined in the leaf lamina as leaves expanded.

Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is an increasingly common affliction linked to the incidence of diabetes and obesity. The hallmark symptom of NAFLD is liver fibrosis, a change in tissue tiber structure in response to disease. NAFLD is currently defined as a histopathologic condition requiring biopsy to diagnose. However, the significant morbidity and high sampling variability associated with biopsy make it less than ideal for clinical use. Several non-invasive, imaging based methods have been proposed to track progression of liver fibrosis and NAFLD. Quantitative MRI techniques using T 2 and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) are particularly promising. The spleen is typically used as a reference organ for liver studies due to its proximity in vivo to the liver. The objective {{of this study is to}} show that the MR parameters of the spleen do not change in response to liver disease, and that the spleen is an <b>appropriate</b> reference <b>organ</b> for imaging of the liver. Volume, T 2, and ADC data were reference organ for imaging of the liver. Volume, T 2, and ADC data were acquired from spleens of mice at progressively more serious stages of NAFLD. Volumes of spleens showed an increase from early to late stage NAFLD. T 2 and ADC remained the same throughout the course of disease. The results of this study indicate spleens experience no consistent change in liver disease sensitive MR parameters, and therefore are an <b>appropriate</b> reference <b>organ</b> for NAFLD diagnosis via MR imaging...|$|R
40|$|The {{shortage}} of <b>appropriate</b> donor <b>organs</b> and the expanding pool of patients waiting for heart transplantation {{have led to}} growing interest in alternative strategies, particularly in mechanical circulatory support. Improved results and the increased applicability and durability with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have enhanced this treatment option available for end-stage heart failure patients. Moreover, outcome with newer pumps have evolved to destination therapy for such patients. Currently, results using nonpulsatile continuous flow pumps document the evolution in outcomes following destination therapy achieved subsequent to the landmark Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance for the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure Trial (REMATCH), {{as well as the}} outcome of pulsatile designed second-generation LVADs. This review describes the currently available types of LVADs, their clinical use and outcomes, and focuses on the patient selection process...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} x-irradiation on the {{capacity}} of carrier-specific mouse T (thymus-derived) lymphocytes to exert a helper function for hapten-specific B (bone marrow-derived) lymphocytes in vivo has been investigated again. Helper function is abolished by exposure of such cells to x-irradiation before, or immediately after, transfer to adoptive hosts. On the other hand, when exposure to x-irradiation occurs under circumstances in which the carrier-primed cells are well-localized in the <b>appropriate</b> lymphoid <b>organs,</b> i. e., either in the carrier-primed animal or 24 hr after adoptive transfer to syngeneic recipients, {{the capacity of}} T lymphocytes to serve as specific helper cells is clearly radioresistant. Evidence indicates that x-irradiation results in undefined, and subtle, changes in the migratory capacity of mouse T lymphocytes, but not in abrogation of T-cell helper function...|$|R
40|$|Defects in apical-basal cell {{polarity}} and abnormal {{expression of}} cell polarity determinants {{are linked to}} human cancer. Loss of polarity is highly correlated with malignancy. In Drosophila, perturbation of apical-basal polarity, including overexpressing the apical determinant Crumbs, can lead to uncontrolled tissue growth. Cells mutant for the basolateral determinant scribble overproliferate and can form neoplastic tumors. Interestingly, scribble mutant clones that arise in wild-type tissues are eliminated and therefore do not manifest their tumorigenic potential. However, the mechanisms by which cell polarity coordinates with growth control pathways in developing <b>organs</b> to achieve <b>appropriate</b> <b>organ</b> size remain obscure. To investigate the function of apical determinants in growth regulation, I investigated the mechanism by which the apical determinant Crumbs affects growth in Drosophila imaginal discs. I found that crumbs gain and loss of function cause overgrowth and induction of Hippo target genes. In addition, Crumbs {{is required for the}} proper localization of Expanded, an upstream component of the Hippo pathway. Furthermore, we uncoupled the cell polarity and growth control function of Crb through structure-functional analysis. Taken together, our data identify a role of Crb in growth regulation specifically through modulation of the Hippo pathway. To further explore the role of polarity in growth control, I investigated how cells mutant for basolateral determinants are eliminated by using patches of cells mutant for scribble (scribble mutant clones) as a model system. We found that competitive cell-cell interactions eliminate tumorigenic scribble cells by modulation of the Hippo pathway. The regulation of Hippo signaling is required and sufficient to restrain the tumorous growth of scribble mutant cells. Artificially increasing the relative fitness of scribble mutant cells unleashes their tumorigenic potential. Therefore, we have identified a novel tumor-suppression mechanism that depends on signaling between normal and tumorigenic cells. These data identify evasion of cell competition as a critical step toward malignancy and illustrate a role for wild-type tissue in eliminating abnormal cells and preventing the formation of tumors...|$|R
40|$|Transplantation {{therapy for}} {{diabetes}} in humans {{is limited by}} the low availability of human donor whole pancreas or islets. Outcomes are complicated by immunosuppressive drug toxicity. Xenotransplantation is a strategy to overcome supply problems. Implantation of tissue obtained early during embryogenesis is a way to reduce transplant immunogenicity. Pig insulin is biologically active in humans. In that regard the pig is an <b>appropriate</b> xenogeneic <b>organ</b> donor. Insulin-producing cells originating from embryonic pig pancreas obtained very early following pancreatic primordium formation [embryonic day 28 (E 28) ] engraft long-term in rhesus macaques. Endocrine cells originating from embryonic pig pancreas transplanted in host mesentery migrate to mesenteric lymph nodes, engraft, differentiate and improve glucose tolerance in rhesus macaques without the need for immune suppression. Transplantation of embryonic pig pancreas is a novel approach towards beta cell replacement therapy that could be applicable to humans.   </p...|$|R
40|$|During development, {{sympathetic}} neurons extend axons along {{a myriad}} of distinct trajectories, often consisting of arteries, to innervate one of a large variety of distinct final target tissues. Whether or not subsets of neurons within complex sympathetic ganglia are predetermined to innervate select end-organs is unknown. Here we demonstrate in mouse embryos that the endothelin family member Edn 3 (ref. 1), acting through the endothelin receptor EdnrA (refs 2, 3), directs extension of axons of a subset of sympathetic neurons from the superior cervical ganglion to a preferred intermediate target, the external carotid artery, which serves as the gateway to select targets, including the salivary glands. These findings establish a previously unknown mechanism of axonal pathfinding involving vascular-derived endothelins, and have broad implications for endothelins as general mediators of axonal growth and guidance in the developing nervous system. Moreover, they suggest a model in which newborn sympathetic neurons distinguish and choose between distinct vascular trajectories to innervate their <b>appropriate</b> end <b>organs...</b>|$|R
