50|$|In {{the state}} of Texas, <b>Administrative</b> License <b>Revocation</b> is a process by which an {{individual}} who is arrested for Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) {{has his or her}} driver's license administratively suspended. This program went into effect on January 1, 1995, and is administrated by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS). DPS records indicate that 103,168 notices of suspension were served during calendar year 2003. During that time period the agency processed 95,495 suspensions.|$|R
5000|$|License {{suspension}} or revocation traditionally follows {{conviction for}} alcohol-impaired or drunk driving. However, under administrative license suspension (ALS) laws, sometimes called <b>administrative</b> license <b>revocation</b> or <b>administrative</b> per se, licenses are confiscated and automatically suspended independent of criminal proceedings whenever a driver either (1) refuses {{to submit to}} chemical testing (blood, breath or, in some states, urine), or (2) submits to testing with results indicating a blood alcohol content of 0.08% or higher.|$|R
40|$|This paper re-examines the {{effectiveness}} of Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) and <b>Administrative</b> License <b>Revocation</b> (ALR) laws in reducing traffic fatalities. Using difference-in-differences estimators of U. S. state-level data with standard errors corrected for autocorrelation, we find no evidence that lowering BAC limits to 0. 08 grams/decaliter has reduced fatality rates, either in total or in alcohol-related crashes. On the other hand, ALR {{is found to be}} an effective in reducing fatalities in all specifications. Endogeneity tests using event analyses indicate temporal causality of ALR laws. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the sensitivity of}} policy conclusions that are derived from crash models using various specifications. Our analyses compare models specified as crash rate or population normalized models (i. e., fatalities per capita or per vehicle miles traveled) adjusted to account for serial correlation in the error term with negative binomial count models with {{the total number of}} fatalities as the dependent variable. Our analyses focus on the interpretation of key policy variables, especially the association between safety-belt laws and <b>administrative</b> license <b>revocation</b> laws on fatalities. Evaluation of statistical significance of parameters, elasticities derived from the models and total fatalities associated with changes in key variables are examined. Results suggest that negative binomial models tend to be more robust and display less variation in results than those linear regression models that account for serial correlation. From a policy perspective, we found no evidence that passage of <b>administrative</b> license <b>revocation</b> laws that automatically suspend the license of a drunk driver have been effective while laws requiring safety-belt usage have been effective. Our results suggest that providing confidence intervals on elasticity estimates and estimated fatalities would provide policy makers with greater confidence in the results of model estimates.

40|$|The authors {{compared}} US {{motor vehicle}} and motorcycle mortality rates during periods when each of several alcohol-related laws were in effect with mortality rates during other periods. During the period 1980 – 1997, there were 792, 184 deaths due to motor vehicle crashes and 63, 052 deaths due to motorcycle crashes. An estimated 26 % and 49 % of these fatalities, respectively, were attributable to alcohol use. The incidence of alcohol-related mortality in motor vehicle crashes was lower when laws specifying a {{blood alcohol concentration}} of 0. 08 g/dl per se (laws stating {{that it is a}} criminal offense to drive with a blood alcohol concentration above the state’s legal limit) were in effect (adjusted rate ratio (RR) = 0. 86, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 83, 0. 88). For motorcycle deaths, the adjusted rate ratio was 0. 87 (95 % CI: 0. 79, 0. 95). The incidence of alcohol-related mortality in motor vehicle crashes was also lower during periods when two other types of laws were in effect: zero tolerance laws (adjusted RR = 0. 88, 95 % CI: 0. 86, 0. 90) and <b>administrative</b> license <b>revocation</b> laws (adjusted RR = 0. 95, 95 % CI: 0. 93, 0. 98).

50|$|Drugs are {{at times}} the cause of social problems. Drugs such as cocaine and opiates are {{addictive}} for some users. A minority of users of such drugs may commit crimes {{in order to obtain}} more drugs. In some individuals, drugs such as methamphetamine have been known to contribute to violent behavior, which would be considered a social problem. Drunk driving is on the rise and is the number two cause of accidental deaths; it is a cause of around 17,000 deaths each year. All but 9 states in USA have adopted the <b>Administrative</b> License <b>Revocation</b> where if you are caught drinking and driving and found guilty you will lose your license for a full year. This is a step that is being taken {{in order to try to}} avoid the occurrence of this social problem.|$|R
500|$|Penalties for DUI vary by {{level of}} {{intoxication}} {{and number of}} previous convictions. A first offense DUI with a BAC level of less than 0.10% faces a fine of $250 to $400, an automobile insurance surcharge of $1000 per year for 3 years, 12 hours of alcohol education, a 3-month license suspension, and imprisonment for up to 30 days (rarely imposed). If the driver's BAC level is 0.10% or greater, the fine increases to $300 to $500, and the license suspension increase to 7 to 12 months. If the driver's BAC level is 0.15% or greater, the driver {{will be required to}} have an ignition interlock device installed in their car for 6 to 12 months after they have their license restored. [...] New Jersey does not have <b>administrative</b> license <b>revocation,</b> and thus a suspected drunk driver's license is not suspended until they are convicted.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, several {{countries}} enacted {{the reduction of the}} legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit, often alongside the <b>administrative</b> license <b>revocation</b> or suspension, to battle drinking-and-driving behavior. Several researchers investigated the effectiveness of these policies by applying different analysis procedures, while assuming population homogeneity in responding to these laws. The present analysis focuses on the evaluation of the impact of BAC limit reduction on different population segments. Poisson regression models, adapted to account for possible observation dependence over time and state specific effects, are estimated to measure the reduction of the number of alcohol-related accidents and fatalities for single-vehicle accidents in 22 U. S. jurisdictions over a period of 15 years starting in 1990. Model estimates demonstrate that, for alcohol-related single-vehicle crashes, (i) BAC laws are more effective in terms of reduction of number of casualties rather than number of accidents, (ii) women and elderly population exhibit higher law compliance with respect to men and to young adult and adult population, respectively, and (iii) the presence of passengers in the vehicle enhances the sense of responsibility of the driver...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{consider}} the effects of state alcohol policies on motor vehicle fatalities for children. While numerous studies have considered the effects of such policies on motor vehicle fatalities for the overall population, for teens, and for the elderly, their effects on fatalities among children in particular have not previously been studied. We use state-level cross-sectional time series data for 1982 - 2002. The dependent variable of interest is fatalities among child motor vehicle occupants (CMVO). Separate models are estimated for 0 - to 4 -yr-olds, 5 - to 9 -yr-olds, and 10 - to 15 -yr-olds, {{as well as for}} fatalities occurring during the day versus the night. We find that number of fatalities among CMVO is strongly correlated to alcohol use measured at the state level and that <b>administrative</b> license <b>revocation</b> policies and higher beer tax rates appear to consistently reduce such fatalities. For two of the three age groups, beer tax rates appear to reduce fatalities during the night rather than the day. However, zero tolerance and blood alcohol concentration limit laws do not seem to have any statistically significant effects on fatalities.

40|$|Crabs (FMP). These {{regulations}} {{revise the}} rules governing the acquisition, use, and retention of quota share established for captains and crew, known as crew quota share or C shares, under the Crab Rationalization Program (CR Program). Regulations implementing Amendment 31 temporarily expand the eligibility requirements for individuals wishing to acquire C share Quota Share (QS) by transfer; establish minimum participation requirements for C share QS holders to be eligible to receive an annual allocation of Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ); establish minimum participation requirements for C share QS holders to be eligible to retain their C share QS and an <b>administrative</b> process for <b>revocation</b> of an individual’s C share QS {{if he or she}} fails to satisfy the minimum participation requirements; establish a regulatory mechanism to ensure that three percent of the total allowable catch (TAC) for each CR Program crab fishery is allocated as IFQ to holders of C share QS; and remove the prohibition on leasing C share IFQ. In addition, this final rule implements a regulatory amendment to the CR Program that: Establishes an earlier deadline for filing annual IFQ, individual processing quota (IPQ), and crab harvesting cooperative IFQ applications, which increases the amount of time during which NMFS will suspend the processing of IFQ and IPQ transfer applications; shortens the amount of time in which to appeal an initial administrative determination to withhold issuance of IFQ or IPQ; and provides that an applicant’s proof of timely filing for IFQ, IPQ, or cooperative IFQ creates a presumption of timely filing.
