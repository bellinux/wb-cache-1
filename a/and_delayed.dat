In this paper, we present worst-case fair bin sort queuing (WBSQ), a new scheduler that has good worst-case fairness <b>and</b> <b>delay</b> properties, yet has low complexity and is amenable to simple hardware implementation. WBSQ achieves this performance by combining features of BSFQ and WF 2 Q+. We establish the worst-case fairness <b>and</b> <b>delay</b> properties of WBSQ through both analysis and simulation.

5|$|Externalizing {{disorders}} (i.e., acting-out disorders) show {{a clearer}} link to delayed gratification, since they more directly involve deficits in impulse control. For example, {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) and aggressive behavior are associated with difficulty delaying gratification in children and adolescents, as are substance abuse, gambling, and other addictive behaviors in adolescents and adults. In a 2010 study, teenagers and young adults with stronger abilities to delay gratification were less likely to drink alcohol, or to smoke cigarettes or cannabis. Interestingly, a 2011 study found that the contrast in delayed gratification between children with and without ADHD was no longer significant after statistically controlling for IQ (in other words, ADHD was not associated with delayed gratification above and beyond the influence of IQ). This may stem from the high correlation between intelligence <b>and</b> <b>delayed</b> gratification, and suggests that the tie between delayed gratification and ADHD could benefit from more investigation.|$|E
