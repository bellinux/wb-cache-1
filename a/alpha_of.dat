25|$|Canted {{vertical}} stabilizers {{are another}} distinguishing design element, one among several other such elements that enable the Hornet's excellent high {{angle of attack}} ability, including oversized horizontal stabilators, oversized trailing edge flaps that operate as flaperons, large full-length leading-edge flaps and flight control computer programming that multiplies the movement of each control surface at low speeds and moves the vertical rudders inboard instead of simply left and right. The Hornet's normally high angle of attack performance envelope was put to rigorous testing and enhanced in the NASA F-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV). NASA used the F-18 HARV to demonstrate flight handling characteristics at high angle-of-attack (<b>alpha)</b> <b>of</b> 65–70 degrees using thrust vectoring vanes.

500|$|Despite many {{explicit}} {{allusions to}} several world religions, Ingrid Reichel {{states that the}} novel is a book for “readers with humor, for reasoners (…), for darwinists, on no account for creationists, {{to a lesser extent}} for people of faith, but rather for atheists, … and fundamentalists drop out entirely”. Another aspect is identified by Karin Gayer when pinpointing the parallel evolution of the patriarchal hierarchy in the narrated society and the alluded social matriarchy, the first resembling chimpanzee communities and the second representing those of bonobos. In addition, she points out the strength of the women characters. She declares {{that at the time of}} the Australopithecus, neither chimpanzees nor bonobos existed, but [...] "the author is not interested in paleoanthropologic precisenesses—he is interested in mirroring our society, in exposing human behavior". She compares Costello with the <b>alpha</b> <b>of</b> a community of chimpanzees and a classical manager, and Akshaya with bonobo females and a modern-day career woman. With regard to these underlying comparisons, Gayer says, [...] "On another level we are struck by the permanent notional commingling of the simian and the human, a composition which leaves us pensive and asks the legitimate question where we, who consider ourselves sapiens in a double sense, should finally classify man." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Duttweiler (1984) Internal Control Index (ICI) {{addresses}} perceived [...] {{problems with}} the Rotter scales, including their forced-choice format, susceptibility to social desirability and heterogeneity (as indicated by [...] factor analysis). She also notes that, while other scales existed in 1984 to measure locus of control, [...] "they appear {{to be subject to}} many of the same problems". Unlike the forced-choice format used on Rotter's scale, Duttweiler's 28-item ICI uses a Likert-type scale in which people must state whether they would rarely, occasionally, sometimes, frequently or usually behave as specified in each of 28 statements. The ICI assess variables pertinent to internal locus: cognitive processing, autonomy, resistance to social influence, self-confidence and delay of gratification.

2500|$|Like {{the members}} of the Sigma, a {{majority}} of {{the members of}} the Chapter of Phi Iota <b>Alpha</b> <b>of</b> the University of Louisiana [...] disillusioned with character given to their brotherhood decided to separate, founding in [...] April 1939 Sigma Iota Alpha [...] fraternity composed of Latin students of this university. As it was to be expected this new grouping was received with distrust by the other Latin fraternal organizations at the university. Being that Phi Sigma Alpha was organized in Puerto Rico with ideals similar to those of the Sigma Iota Alpha in Louisiana, and being both organizations the product of almost identical preceding brotherhoods, negotiations arose immediately to fuse both brotherhoods into a single one. This was decided in a convention celebrated on September 10, 1939 in the University Puerto Rico, organizing themselves Fraternidad Sigma or (Sigma Fraternity) with its ramifications; Phi Sigma Alpha Zone in Puerto Rico and Sigma Iota Alpha Zone in Louisiana (Later the USA Zone's name was changed to Phi Sigma Beta Zone and came to include other universities of the north).|$|E
