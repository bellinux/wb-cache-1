5|$|Herpes {{antiviral}} therapy {{began in}} the early 1960s with the experimental use of medications that interfered with viral replication called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) inhibitors. The original use was against normally fatal or debilitating illnesses such as adult encephalitis, keratitis, in immunocompromised (transplant) patients, or disseminated herpes zoster. The original compounds used were 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, AKA idoxuridine, IUdR, or(IDU) and 1-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine or ara-C, later marketed under the name cytosar or cytorabine. The usage expanded to include topical treatment of herpes simplex, zoster, and varicella. Some trials combined different antivirals with differing results. The introduction of 9-β-D-arabinofuranosyladenine, (ara-A or vidarabine), considerably less toxic than ara-C, in the mid-1970s, heralded the way for the beginning of regular neonatal antiviral treatment. Vidarabine was the first systemically administered antiviral medication with activity against HSV for which therapeutic efficacy outweighed toxicity for the management of life-threatening HSV disease. Intravenous vidarabine was licensed for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1977. Other experimental antivirals of that period included: heparin, trifluorothymidine (TFT), Ribivarin, interferon, Virazole, and 5-methoxymethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (MMUdR). The introduction of 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine, AKA acyclovir, in the late 1970s raised antiviral treatment another notch and led to vidarabine vs. acyclovir trials in the late 1980s. The lower toxicity and ease of administration over vidarabine has led to acyclovir becoming the drug of choice for herpes treatment after it was licensed by the FDA in 1998. Another advantage in the treatment of neonatal herpes included greater reductions in mortality and morbidity with increased dosages, which did not occur when compared with increased dosages of vidarabine. However, acyclovir seems to inhibit antibody response, and newborns on acyclovir antiviral treatment experienced a slower rise in <b>antibody</b> <b>titer</b> than those on vidarabine.|$|E

Primary immunization consisted of 3 injections at 6 week intervals, and 148 women known to be previously fertile completed primary immunization. All women generated antibodies against hCG, but only 119 (80%) generated antibody titers clearly above 50ng/mL, which was the estimated level for efficacy. Blood samples were taken twice a month, and booster injections were given when antibody titers declined below 50ng/mL in women who wished to continue using the vaccine.

2500|$|Since Harlow's {{pioneering}} work on touch research in development, recent work in rats has {{found evidence that}} touch during infancy resulted in a decrease in corticosteroid, a steroid hormone involved in stress, {{and an increase in}} glucocorticoid receptors in many regions of the brain. Schanberg and Field found that even short-term interruption of mother–pup interaction in rats markedly affected several biochemical processes in the developing pup: a reduction in ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity, a sensitive index of cell growth and differentiation; a reduction in growth hormone release (in all body organs, including the heart and liver, and throughout the brain, including the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem); an increase in corticosterone secretion; and suppressed tissue ODC responsivity to administered growth hormone. Additionally, it was found that animals who are touch-deprived have weakened immune systems. Investigators have measured a direct, positive relationship between the amount of contact and grooming an infant monkey receives during its first six months of life, and its ability to produce <b>antibody</b> <b>titer</b> (IgG and IgM) in response to an antibody challenge (tetanus) at a little over one year of age. Trying to identify a mechanism for the [...] "immunology of touch", some investigators point to modulations of arousal and associated CNS-hormonal activity. Touch deprivation may cause stress-induced activation of the pituitary–adrenal system, which, in turn, leads to increased plasma cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone. Likewise, researchers suggest, regular and [...] "natural" [...] stimulation of the skin may moderate these pituitary–adrenal responses in a positive and healthful way.|$|E

40|$|A {{comparison}} of <b>antibody</b> <b>titers</b> to JC virus (JCV) or BK virus (BKV) {{was made by}} hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with 114 human plasma samples. <b>Antibody</b> <b>titers</b> to JCV or BKV determined by HI were lower than those determined by EIA. Nevertheless, as HI titers increased so did EIA <b>titers.</b> When <b>antibody</b> data were compared by the Spearman rank correlation test, highly significant correlations were found between HI and EIA titers. Results obtained by plotting EIA <b>antibody</b> <b>titers</b> for JCV against those for BKV generally showed a reciprocal relationship, i. e., samples with high <b>antibody</b> <b>titers</b> to JCV had lower <b>antibody</b> <b>titers</b> to BKV and vice versa. Some samples, however, had <b>antibody</b> <b>titers</b> to both viruses. Of the samples tested, 25. 4 % (25 of 114) had HI and EIA <b>antibody</b> <b>titers</b> to JCV and BKV which were identical or closely related. This is not the scenario one would expect for cross-reactive epitopes shared by the two viruses, but one suggesting that these samples were from individuals who had experienced infections by both viruses. Adsorption with concentrated JCV or BKV antigen of sera with high <b>antibody</b> <b>titers</b> to both JCV and BKV and testing by JCV and BKV EIA gave results which support this conclusion. Although 52. 6 % (51 of 97) of the samples from the Japanese population tested had very high <b>antibody</b> <b>titers</b> (≥ 40, 960) to either JCV or BKV, none of the samples were found by a dot blot immunoassay to have antibodies which cross-reacted with simian virus 40.

40|$|Objective: HIV-positive {{individuals}} have lower <b>antibody</b> <b>titers</b> to influenza viruses than HIV-negative individuals, {{and the benefits}} of the annual vaccinations are controversially discussed. Also, there is no information about the breadth of the antibody response in HIV-infected individuals. Design: The binding and neutralizing <b>antibody</b> <b>titers</b> to various human and nonhuman influenza A virus strain were determined in sera from 146 HIV-infected volunteers: They were compared with those found in 305 randomly selected HIV-negative donors, and put in relation to HIV-specific parameters. Uni and multivariable regression was used to identify HIV-specific parameters associated with the measured binding and neutralizing activity. Methods: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and in-vitro neutralization assays were used to determine the binding and neutralizing antibodiy titers to homo and heterosubtypic influenza A subtypes. Results: We found that both homo and heterosubtypic <b>antibody</b> <b>titers</b> are lower in HIV-positive individuals. Vaccination promoted higher binding and neutralizing <b>antibody</b> <b>titers</b> to human but not to nonhuman isolates. HIV-induced immune damage (high viral load, low CD 4 + T cell counts, and long untreated disease progression) is associated with impaired homosubtypic responses, but can have beneficial effects on the development of heterosubtypic antibodies, and an improved ratio of binding to neutralizing <b>antibody</b> <b>titers</b> to homosubtypic isolates. Conclusions: Our results indicate that repetitive vaccinations in HIV-positive individuals enhance <b>antibody</b> <b>titers</b> to human isolates. Interestingly, development of <b>antibody</b> <b>titers</b> to conserved heterosubtypic epitopes paradoxically appeared to profit from HIV-induced immune damage, as did the ratio of binding to neutralizing antibodies...|$|R
40|$|The {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HSV- 1) latency-associated {{transcript}} (LAT) gene is essential for efficient spontaneous reactivation in the rabbit ocular model of HSV- 1 latency and reactivation. LAT is also the only viral gene abundantly expressed during latency. Rabbits were ocularly infected with the wild-type HSV- 1 strain McKrae or the McKrae-derived LAT null mutant dLAT 2903. Serum neutralizing <b>antibody</b> <b>titers</b> were determined at various times during acute and latent infection. The neutralizing <b>antibody</b> <b>titers</b> induced by both viruses increased and were similar throughout the first 45 days after infection (P > 0. 05). However, by day 59 postinfection (approximately 31 to 45 days after latency had been established), the neutralizing <b>antibody</b> <b>titers</b> induced by wild-type virus and dLAT 2903 diverged significantly (P = 0. 0005). The dLAT 2903 -induced neutralizing <b>antibody</b> <b>titers</b> decreased, while the wild-type virus-induced neutralizing <b>antibody</b> <b>titers</b> continued to increase. A rescuant of dLAT 2903, in which spontaneous reactivation was fully restored, induced wild-type neutralizing antibody levels on day 59 postinfection. A second LAT mutant with impaired spontaneous reactivation had neutralizing antibody levels {{comparable to those of}} dLAT 2903. In contrast to the results obtained in rabbits, in mice, neutralizing <b>antibody</b> <b>titers</b> did not increase over time during latency with any of the viruses. Since LAT is expressed in both rabbits and mice during latency, the difference in neutralizing <b>antibody</b> <b>titers</b> between these animals is unlikely to be due to expression of a LAT protein during latency. In contrast, LAT-positive (LAT+), but not LAT-negative (LAT−), viruses undergo efficient spontaneous reactivation in rabbits, while neither LAT+ nor LAT− viruses undergo efficient spontaneous reactivation in mice. Thus, the increase in neutralizing <b>antibody</b> <b>titers</b> in rabbits latently infected with LAT+ viruses may have been due to continued restimulation of the immune system by spontaneously reactivating virus...|$|R
