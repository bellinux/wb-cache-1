[...] Pal would come to the show's studio home at Stage One of KTTV in Los Angeles every day with his son during filming. [...] He had a bed behind the set, and was respectfully termed The Old Man.

500|$|During the localization, Bateman had to {{keep track}} of the {{numerous}} plot points throughout the game, as the script had not been written in chronological order due to the numerous endings. Localizing the game took roughly two months. Another big challenge was getting the localization done in time: Nobara Nakayama, the game's translator, worked on it for 30 days, and the editing process took two months. Because of this, Bateman had to do most of the work [...] "on the fly". Nakayama had started playing the game prior to starting work on the localization, but did not finish playing it until she was more than halfway through translating it; after learning that the plot hinged on a Japanese pun, they had to halt the localization, discuss it with Uchikoshi, come up with a solution, <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> whole game to make sure that it still made sense.|$|E

[...] They wanted to record a live version of the song, but producer Jack Douglas persuaded them to record a studio version, which actually consisted of two {{different versions of the}} song. [...] The first part was slower, [...] "more groove-oriented", while the second was a spirited rocker. [...] To give the second part more of a live sound, Douglas overdubbed crowd noise from The Concert for Bangladesh, the 1971 benefit organized by George Harrison. [...] Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner, who worked with Lou Reed and Alice Cooper, were brought in to record the guitar parts. [...] According to Hunter, [...] "We [...] wanted to keep the solos equal so we'd sit down... <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> material so it was totally even... We didn't want it to look like there was a rhythm guitar player and a lead guitar player, because that's what we both did". [...] Hunter later elaborated: ...|$|E

500|$|In February 2009, Cooper hosted Saturday Night Live {{with musical}} guest TV on the Radio, portraying actor Christian Bale in one skit. Later that year, he {{appeared}} in a supporting role in the film He's Just Not That Into You. Cooper's breakthrough role came in Todd Phillips' comedy The Hangover (2009). He played Phil Wenneck, {{one of the three}} friends—alongside Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis—to wake up from a bachelor party in Las Vegas, with no memory of the previous night and the bachelor missing. The Hangover was a commercial success and finished as among the highest-grossing R-rated films in the United States. The New York Times A. O. Scott wrote: [...] "Mr. Cooper... offers the most interesting variation on an old standard, playing his aggressive, cocky frat boy with a snarl of rage that masks an anxiety as hard to account for as it is to miss." [...] For his performance, Cooper received an award at the 13th Hollywood Film Festival and his first nomination for MTV Movie Awards—Best Comedic Performance. The newspaper The Daily Telegraph opined that the success of the film turned Cooper into [...] "a bona fide leading man". Nevertheless, Cooper stated in a 2011 interview with Shave: [...] "It's the same. I mean, look, more doors have been opened for sure, but it's not like I sit back with a cigar on Monday morning <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> scripts that have been offered." ...|$|E

The second game took around three months to translate and four months to edit. A big challenge in localizing it was catching the several subtle hints to the game's ending that appear throughout the story. Unlike the previous two Zero Escape titles, a North American version of the third game was produced alongside the Japanese version.|$|E

2500|$|Casting for Broadchurch series one was {{overseen by}} casting {{directors}} Kelly Valentine Hendry and Victor Jenkins of VHJ Casting. New series two cast members included James D'Arcy, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Eve Myles, Charlotte Rampling, Meera Syal, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge. None {{of the new}} characters were connected to the Latimer murder or any other homicide, Chibnall said. Rampling {{was named to the}} cast on 12 May, and Chibnall said her [...] "character {{is an integral part of}} the new story". He decided to ask Rampling to join the cast after seeing her perform in a video art piece directed by Steve McQueen. [...] "She was so lively and mischievous but also tough and steely and I thought, that's such a match for how I see this character," [...] Chibnall said. ITV announced that D'Arcy, Jean-Baptiste, Myles, and Waller-Bridge were joining the series on 21 May 2014. Rampling, who lives in France, had seen series one on French television and was a fan of the programme. [...] "The sense of community, the idea of solidarity in a small town — all that is broken when suspicion starts to creep in. There is something very human about it. You don't know what happens in real life when people suffer this kind of tragedy. People go off and live their lives.

2500|$|Once a task is over, {{the teams}} {{return to the}} boardroom, <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> same process as in the main show: an initial review of each team's {{performance}} is given, followed by {{a result of their}} overall effort; the losing team faces a deeper review of their performance; and a final boardroom session is held, with the young candidates involved in it giving reasons and arguments over why they should remain in the process. Unlike the main show, the fired candidate does not get filmed riding a taxi, but instead rides back home in Sugar's limo, and also do not wear an overcoat and carry their suitcase with them when they board the vehicle. The final episode functions in the same manner, with the finalists being able to pick candidates that were eliminated in the contest {{to be a part of}} their team and help them to win the contest, with the winner chosen by Lord Sugar; in both the first and third series, the final featured four candidates, and so adopted a similar approach to that of the final episode of the fourth series of The Apprentice, in that they were divided into two teams, with the losing team being fired, before Sugar debated on which of the two in the winning team that he [...] "hired".|$|E
