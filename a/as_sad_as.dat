Although he enjoyed Ramirez's performance, Pascua was {{critical}} {{of the rest of}} the episode, writing: [...] "The funeral wasn't <b>as</b> <b>sad</b> <b>as</b> I thought it would be. There were so many pre-episode pictures up that I thought the funeral would take up half the show, then it was five minutes and it wasn't sad at all.

Arguing against this practice, Hazlitt brings in a lengthy quote from an article Lamb wrote for Leigh Hunt's Reflector, which concludes: [...] "A happy ending!—as if the living martyrdom that Lear had gone through,—the flaying of his feelings alive, did not make a fair dismissal from life the only decorous thing for him." ...|$|E
