25|$|Electronic Patient Records (EPR) {{have been}} in used since 2007 {{virtually}} in every healthcare provider. The development of health information systems has been largely uncoordinated at the national level, {{partly due to the}} decentralized healthcare system. As a result, several non-interoperable information systems are often used even within a single organization, which inhibits information exchange within and across provider organizations. Efforts are underway to create a common, national structure for communication between patients <b>and</b> <b>providers</b> over the internet.|$|E

25|$|Pakistani women lack {{social value}} and status because of {{negation}} of {{their roles as}} producers <b>and</b> <b>providers</b> in all social roles. The preference for sons due to their productive role often dictates the allocation of household resources in their favor. Traditionally, male {{members of the family}} are given better education and are equipped with skills to compete for resources in the public arena, while female members are imparted domestic skills to be good mothers and wives. Lack of skills, limited opportunities in the job market, and social, religious and cultural restrictions limit women’s chances to compete for resources in the public arena. This situation has led to the social and economic dependency of women that becomes the basis for male power over women in all social relationships.|$|E

25|$|The {{inadequate}} {{control of}} tuberculosis {{can be linked}} to a malfunctioning health system. From 1978 to 2002, the government's share of total health expenditure fell from 32% to 16%. This reduction forced many Chinese health-care facilities <b>and</b> <b>providers</b> to focus on the generation of revenue, with little concern for public health. Hospitals and clinics essentially functioned (and continue to function) as for-profit entities. In 2000, nearly 90% of patients with tuberculosis initiated their diagnostic and treatment process in hospitals and non-public health-care facilities, where they were given tests and drugs as long as they could pay. Many patients who improved or ran out of money discontinued treatment. Thus, only 20% of patients with tuberculosis treated outside the public health system took their tuberculosis medications regularly in 2000. Such irregular treatment breeds drug-resistant tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|The National Organization for Women ("NOW") as {{plaintiff}} {{filed the}} suit {{as a civil}} class-action in 1986 in federal district court on behalf of women seeking abortions and on behalf of various abortion clinics <b>and</b> <b>providers.</b> Plaintiffs sought monetary damages and injunctions under the RICO, Hobbs, and the Travel Acts, alleging that the defendants against whom the suit was filed are racketeering organizations engaging in a conspiracy to prevent {{access to health care}} facilities providing abortion services. The suit's named defendants were Joseph Scheidler and other pro-life/anti-abortion protesters and organizations who were members of the Pro-Life Action League (PLAL), and specifically the Oklahoma Pro-Life Action Network (PLAN). The underlying issues in the case concerning access to abortion and the coercive and violent tactics used by some to prevent such access formed a central rallying point for both sides of the national abortion debate.|$|E

30|$|The goal of {{the policy}} {{federation}} algorithm is to decompose and distribute the tenant policies so that sensitive attributes and policies remain confidential and the evaluation performance is optimized, i.e., the evaluation duration is minimized. For attribute-based policies, this evaluation duration is mainly determined by the latency of fetching the required attributes[17]. The latency of a remote attribute fetch between tenant <b>and</b> <b>provider</b> will be {{an order of magnitude}} larger than a local database call, taking into account the complex data flows in federated applications and the geographical distance between tenant <b>and</b> <b>provider.</b> Therefore, the {{goal of the}} algorithm is to minimize the number of requests between tenant <b>and</b> <b>provider.</b>|$|R
