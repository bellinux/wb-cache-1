While specifically dealing with the actual management of the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Register,</b> an important primary unitary evidence document, we also keep a general character of the discussion, in order to argue for the generality of the proposed solution. Hence, for the identified and described problem space we propose an administrative and software infrastructure solution. This work is an empirical research in which our aim is primarily to identify key problems within the local governing authorities from several perspectives concerning {{the management of the}} <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Register</b> then to address those problems with an integrated document management system. For the proposed solution we give and argue the general system architecture and describe the key-mechanisms that support quality requirements. The relevance of this research concern is given by the impact of the actual <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Register</b> management on important stakeholders. This can be measured as the satisfaction felt by taxpayers and the performance of the local governing authorities, the Financial Administration, the Agency of Payments and Intervention in Agriculture and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. This work is also intended as a start-point for a new, modern thinking of the governing authorities in their pursue to improve public services. For this, in our work we highlight the importance of complete system analysis at all administrative levels as a main priority concern for all public managers. Our aim is the improvement of the public service by rising the awareness of the decision makers on the necessity of using integrated document management solutions for the provided services. Also, our work aims at increasing the efficiency with which nowadays, governing authorities invest public funds in various IT projects for the management of their services.

The study {{is based on a}} practical need in Estonian government institution the Estonian <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Registers</b> and Information Board (ARIB). The knowledge management becomes a key issue when employees leave and new workers are hired. ARIB is an organization where very many new employees have been hired during the last year and some more will be hired in 2005. The organization is growing very rapidly and since joining European Union ARIB has received many new tasks and functions to fulfill. The theoretical part of the paper gives overview of the knowledge management theory, explains its importance and introduces known practices. In {{the first part of the}} work the analysis about the differences between experts and novices is given. It is discussed what influence has the environment and organizational culture to the knowledge transfer processes. Since ARIB is a public sector organization I also argue the possibility and importance of the knowledge management in public sector. For analyzing this field of research, 18 interviews were carried out in ARIB. The results of the survey taken in the organization earlier (in 2004) were used as background information. The interviews were taken from 16 new employees of ARIB (who had worked 2 - 4 months) and two experienced employees (who had worked in ARIB more than four years). On the basis of the study I identified the critical knowledge groups in ARIB and also the methods and channels used for knowledge transfer. I found out that the knowledge transfer process in ARIB is not sufficient to ensure the continuity of the organizational knowledge base. The current thesis concludes that knowledge management plays important role in an organization when people leave and new employees are hired. Every organization has to choose the best ways to organize knowledge related processes and how to motivate the employees to share their knowledge...|$|R

The study is based on national <b>agricultural</b> <b>registers</b> for Denmark and on aerial photo interpretation of three study areas, representing different Danish landscape types. Results indicate significantly smaller fields and significantly higher densities of unculti-vated landscape elements on small farms (< 25 ha). At national level, current differences between small and large farms are to some extent caused by landscape changes between 1998 and 2004. Analyses of the study areas indicate that current differences between small and large farms mainly evolved between 1982 and 2002, while the influences of changes between 1954 and 1982 are limited. Relationships between farms size and landscape composition are independent of spatial variations in soil type and slope conditions. Consequently, attention must be paid to other parameters linked to farm size. In particular, the effects on landscape composition of part-time and hobby farming, as well as production type, must be considered...|$|R

The {{region of}} Apuseni Mountain has {{suffered}} many changes over time, which {{is due to}} supra intensive exploitation of the wood mass, depopulation of villages, decreasing the number of livestock and land abandonment. The civilization of villages from „Stone Land ” is represented by a specific landscape which includes reliefs forms, the pastoral construction generated by a way of life is seriously threatened by current developments. The {{purpose of this study was}} to track the time evolution of the structure of agricultural land, livestock and prospects of the area. The information about agricultural surfaces, livestock (their evolution in time) were taken from the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Registers</b> of Băişoara, Beliş, Călăţele villages, (General Urban Plan- 1998 - 2010 - 2011), but also from villages records (1990 - 2011) from I.

These data were graphically processed. The results show that during the years 1990 - 2011, the Băişoara, Beliş, Călăţele villages have occurred important changes in the categories of land use, livestock and degree of depopulation of villages. It was found that over time, the population of the villages taken to be studied (Băişoara, Beliş, Călăţele) decreased and therefore changes occurred regarding land use, the number of livestock decreased and pastures are under cargo.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} relationships between organic farming and landscape composition in Denmark. Landscape composition was analysed in terms of density of uncultivated landscape elements (I), number of land uses per hectare (II), diversity of land use (III) and mean field size (IV). Two analytical approaches were used. The first {{was based on an}} examination of the national <b>agricultural</b> <b>registers</b> for 1998, 2001 and 2004. The second approach used aerial photo interpretation for an analysis of 72 conventional and 40 organic farms within three sample areas for 1982, 1995 and 2002. The national analysis indicated that organic farming has a direct effect on landscape composition. In 2001, organic farms were characterised by a higher number of land uses per ha, a higher land use diversity and smaller mean field sizes. From 1998 to 2004 conversion to organic farming was related to an increasing number of land uses per ha, increasing land-use diversity and decreasing mean field sizes. Relationships between organic farming and landscape composition were independent of variations in regional location, farm size or farm size change. At the level of sample areas, a significant relationship between organic farming and landscape composition was only found for densities of small biotopes. However, when differences in farm size and physical geographical conditions between conventional and organic farms were taken into account, several significant differences in landscape composition were clarified in two of the three sample areas. Furthermore, changes in landscape composition following conversion to organic farming were largely biased by the characteristics of the sample areas. Thus, in contrast to the national level, the sample area study indicated that differences in landscape composition between organic and conventional farms were not a direct implication of organic farming practices, but were related to variations within other parameters and to the location of organically farmed land...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{automatic}} vine detection from airborne Infrared Color (IRC) images is addressed. An automatic method was designed, {{based on a}} separate modeling of the textural and spectral information extracted from the data. A multi-resolution analysis associated with a wavelet transform allows the separation of spectral and spatial information. After {{a description of the}} vine detection problem, the automatic method is described. An example application is proposed and a quantitative evaluation of the results achieved is presented. The analysis of the results demonstrates the efficiency of the method. The square system of planting is the main source of errors. But this growing technique is now nearly abandoned in France due to mechanization. Thus, this method may help photointerpreters in the updating or definition of <b>agricultural</b> <b>registers</b> of vineyards as defined by the European Commission. Background The automatic characterization of heterogeneous environ-ments with regular structures are of interest for cultures such as orchards, vineyards, and market gardens, and is of tremen-dous importance for the establishment and the survey of national or European registers. The diversity of objects that compose these environments (plants, soil, shadow, grass, stones, and organic residues) makes it a very complex process. This paper focuses on automatic vine detection. This problem is representative, at an easily accessible scale in the field, of the complexity of these environments. Only a few studies have been conducted in the field of remote sensing for vine detection (Riom, 1992). Boissard (1972; 1973) has shown that the textural and structural elements in avine parcel can be accessed by the Fou-rier transformation of airborne photographs. These elements lead to the characterization of the stocks of vine and of their structure (orientation of the rows, distance between the stocks, dimension of the stocks, and leaves). Using spectral and tem-poral parameters with a very high spatial resolution, Debussh...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the on-farm mortality (unassisted death and euthanasia), reasons, as well as risk factors for on-farm mortality in Estonian dairy cattle. Data of years 2013 and 2014 about all cattle from dairy herds in Estonia was collected from the Estonian <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Registers</b> and Information Board. The dataset included records of 363, 380 animals from 2616 herds. Multivariable Weibull proportional hazard models with herd as random effect were composed for detecting significant associations between potential risk factors and on-farm mortality (composed outcome including unassisted death and euthanasia). Data from Estonian Livestock Performance Recording Ltd was used to determine the reasons for on-farm mortality. The overall mortality rate (MR) including unassisted death and euthanasia was 6. 95 per 100 animal-years. Mortality was highest in male (MR= 55. 96 per 100 animal-years, 95 % CI 54. 53; 57. 42) and female (MR= 27. 70 per 100 animal-years, 95 % CI 26. 99; 28. 43) calves up to three months old and lowest in female cattle aged 1218 months (MR= 0. 99 per 100 animal-years, 95 % CI 0. 89; 1. 10). The main farmers' stated reasons for dairy cow mortality were 'Metabolic and digestive disorders' and 'Feet/claw disorders'. The main reasons for on-farm mortality among youngstock were 'Metabolic and digestive disorders', 'Respiratory and infectious diseases' and 'Other reasons'. The risk factor analysis was carried out in three age categories: = 24 months. Estonian Holstein breed was associated with significantly higher risk of mortality compared to Estonian Red breed cattle in every age group. The hazard of on-farm mortality was significantly higher for herds with over 400 animal-years compared to smaller herds in all age groups. Regional differences in mortality hazard were present in the model of youngstock over 3 months and adult cattle. Seasonal differences in mortality rate were present and differed by age groups.

A questionnarie was constructed based on theory, reserch questions and organizations quaintness and and sent to 261 workers of the centre of ARIB. 12 % finished the questionnarie, resulting 32 filled questionnarie. Outcome was supplemented with an expert-interview, two observations and two informant-interviews. Meeting is a widely used working method in ARIB and there are rather more paricipants in the meetings than less. Some of the meetings share common values in meeting leadership and well elaborated protocol system, others form different subcultures. Communication direction and style of the meetings are free in ARIB. The satisfaction level is highest with the decision-making meetings and lowest with information meetings. As {{there are a lot of}} different workgroup meetings then the level of satisfaction also varies. Laptops are mostly used related to the meetings and when the meetings don´t demand so much attention, then also to complete other work-related tasks. Mobile phones are mostly used for work or private life related issues. Using laptops during the meetings is not considered disturbing on the contrary to using mobile phones. The directorate of ARIB finds that laptop usage during the meetings is effective; mobile phone usage is limited with unwritten rules. Multitasking enables more effective time use with the jeopardy of information loss. Employees consider the ability to multitask useful until paricipating in the meeting remains primary action. Author fulfilled the goals of the thesis by answering the research questions. This topic deserves to be researched as ICT use has many possibilities that can be applied to the meetings to make them more effective.
