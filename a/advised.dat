40|$|Appreciative <b>Advising</b> {{represents}} a revolutionary {{new approach to}} the field of academic <b>advising.</b> Based on Appreciative Inquiry, which was developed by David Cooperrider at Case Western Reserve University in the 1980 ’s, Appreciative <b>Advising</b> is also influenced by positive psychology, reality therapy, and strengths based <b>advising.</b> The Appreciative <b>Advising</b> model makes use of positive, open-ended questions and a the development of a reciprocal relationship between student and advisor to help students achieve their academic and career goals. Pioneered by Bloom, Hutson, and He, Appreciative <b>Advising</b> is fully student centered and shows great promise in helping students {{from a wide variety of}} backgrounds achieve academic success. Bloom, Hunter, and He expanded on the 4 -D model of Appreciative Inquiry to develop the six phases of Appreciative <b>Advising</b> – Disarm, Discover, Dream, Design, Deliver, and Don’t Settle. This study explored the perceptions of nine academic advisors using the Appreciative <b>Advising</b> approach in three different institutions of higher education to identify ways and to what extent using Appreciative <b>Advising</b> impacted their <b>advising</b> practice and their job satisfaction. The majority of the academic advisors interviewed believed that Appreciative <b>Advising</b> had positively impacted them in four ways: a) Appreciative <b>Advising</b> had enabled them to better utilize their strengths, skills, and talents; b) Appreciative <b>Advising</b> had provided a framework that enabled them to be more effective academic advisors; c) Appreciative <b>Advising</b> had enabled a stronger advisor/student relationship, resulting in greater job satisfaction; and d) Appreciative <b>Advising</b> had positively impacted relationships outside of the advisor/student relationship with co-workers, family, friends, and others.

40|$|According to {{the five}} {{functions}} of academic <b>advising</b> as outlined by Morris (1973), this study investigates the specific academic <b>advising</b> needs of elementary education majors as perceived by elementary education students and faculty advisors at The University of Arizona.

Lastly, suggestions for {{improving the quality of}} academic <b>advising</b> for elementary education majors are examined. Twenty-five elementary education majors of senior standing admitted to the College of Education and twelve elementary education faculty advisors are individually administered an oral semi-structured questionnaire. Interview responses are categorized according {{to the five}} functions of academic <b>advising,</b> the unique <b>advising</b> needs of elementary education majors, <b>advising</b> needs which are currently being met, <b>advising</b> needs which are not being met, and suggestions for improving the quality of academic <b>advising.</b> The findings indicate that those <b>advising</b> needs which are specific to elementary education majors are contained within the functions of providing accurate information and long-range program planning. The <b>advising</b> needs identified within the functions of discerning the purpose of the institution, short-term course selection, and facilitating student development are generic in nature with no specific referent to teacher education. The unique <b>advising</b> needs of elementary education majors are identified as: (1) helping students to determine their suitability to the profession, (2) developing interpersonal skills, (3) developing communicative competence, (4) making decisions concerning program options, and (5) facilitating professional development. <b>Advising</b> needs which are being met are those related to program planning. <b>Advising</b> needs which are not being met are those related to determining suitability to the profession and facilitating professional development.

40|$|Abstract — The {{primary and}} {{necessary}} task for any undergraduate student {{has to go}} through after his orientation is <b>advising.</b> <b>Advising</b> {{plays a key role in}} a student’s success towards his degree program. Many reports were published recently on the survey of the declining college graduate students [2]. There might be several reasons behind this, but the major drawback of this decline is due to the improper <b>advising</b> of the students. Noticing the importance of the <b>advising</b> system, an Intelligent <b>Advising</b> System is designed which helps the students prepare their degree plan by selecting their major and minor/s. This paper mainly focuses on the importance of the <b>advising</b> system and how the IAS helps the students in online <b>advising.</b> Key words: <b>Advising</b> System, Database, and Data Mining.
