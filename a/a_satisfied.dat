500|$|... "Never Too Far" [...] is a mid-tempo ballad. The {{song was}} written and {{produced}} by Carey and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis; {{it was released}} as the second single from her first soundtrack album, Glitter (2001). It incorporates music from several musical instruments, including the piano, guitar and organ. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, the song is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 62 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of C major with Carey's vocal range spanning from the low-note of D3 to the high-note of Ab5. The song's chorus has a basic chord progression of Gsus2–G–G/F–Em7–G/D–C-G/B–Am7. Described as an [...] "adult-contemporary, slow-jam love song", the song's lyrics read [...] "Too painful to talk about it, so I hold it in / So my heart can mend and be brave enough to love again", speaking of emotions felt by the protagonist in the film. [...] "Never Too Far" [...] features [...] "a bed of synthesized strings, gentle drums and Spanish-style guitar" [...] as its primary instrumentation, and incorporates violin and keyboard notes prior to the first verse. According to Chuck Taylor from Billboard, Carey sings the lyrics with [...] "appreciable subtlety, gliding effortlessly" [...] through the song. It ends with a 15-second note that would [...] "evoke <b>a</b> <b>satisfied</b> sigh".|$|E
500|$|As {{part of the}} Mermaid Ball concert tour's setlist, [...] "Jumanji" [...] was {{performed}} several times on the aforementioned tour. Banks performed the song at the Bowery Ballroom on June 4, 2012, {{as part of her}} Mermaid Ball tour's setlist, with a pair of athletic backup dancers. Corban Goble of Stereogum criticized the use of dancers, inferring Banks [...] them, citing, [...] " [...] it was hard to notice them when they flanked Banks, such was the magnetism of Banks's onstage exercise". Goble also noted the crowd's reaction to the song, stating it [...] "elicited the <b>a</b> <b>satisfied</b> sigh of recognition from the audience when the first bars dropped". Ray Rahman of Entertainment Weekly praised the performance, saying, [...] "Things jumped off when she ripped into her Internet hit 'Jumanji'". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard opined that the performance [...] "thumped like a wild animal". Another time the song {{was performed}} was, again, a part of the Mermaid Ball, at the Fonda Theatre on July 14, 2012. Ernest Hardy of the Los Angeles Times lauded the performance, comparing Banks's vocal delivery on both [...] "Jumanji" [...] and [...] "Esta Noche" [...] to that of Lil' Kim's. Hardy continued with his praise, citing, Banks was [...] "owning the crowd", and that her [...] "breath control was impeccable". Another performance of [...] "Jumanji" [...] was on October 13, 2012, at the Sea Life Centre London Aquarium in London. In an article about the show written for MTV UK's website, Emma Knock called the lyrics to the performance a [...] "real crowd pleaser", and noticed the crowd [...] "did their best to sing along to the likes of 'Jumanji'".|$|E
500|$|Audition {{has been}} {{described}} as an influence on [...] "torture porn". The term was invented by David Edelstein to describe films such as Saw, The Devil's Rejects and Wolf Creek that offer [...] "titillating and shocking" [...] scenes that push the audience to the margins of depravity for them to [...] "feel something". Audition influenced American directors such as Eli Roth. Roth stated that Audition influenced him to make his film Hostel, with Miike even making a cameo as <b>a</b> <b>satisfied</b> customer of the kidnappers who let customers torture their victims. Richard Corliss, writing in Time, opined that Audition was different from torture porn films as: [...] "unlike Saw and its imitators in the genre of torture porn, Audition doesn't go for gore-ific money shots. Miike's films live inside their characters, taking the temperature of their longings, the ridiculous ambitions they chase so obsessively and their need to experience the extreme to prove they're alive". Audition was listed by twin directors Jen and Sylvia Soska as one of their favourite horror films, and with the sisters saying that it was an influence on their film American Mary. The directors noted the character of Asami, stating that an audience generally sees: [...] "female characters in a horror film as the helpless victim. This film leads you in one direction, skillfully hinting at a darker storyline for the otherwise meek and slight Asami until the final 15 minutes where we are introduced to a merciless monster. A perfect personification of the irrational rage of a woman scorned". Director Quentin Tarantino included Audition in his list of top 20 films released since 1992 (the year he became a director). Audition was among the films included in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.|$|E

[...] As the Prince is driven in his carriage into the city, he passes Tancredi's villa, worrying again that Tancredi's fallen in with bad company—specifically, with the rebels fighting to overthrow the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. The Prince's thoughts vacillate between anticipation and guilt, between disgust with his wife (who crosses herself whenever they make love) and admiration of her prudery. Two hours later, his thoughts run a similar course, {{with the addition of a}} kind of disgusted satisfaction with the prostitute and <b>a</b> <b>satisfied</b> disgust with his own body.

2500|$|Others, such as N. W. Thomas and Sigmund Freud have {{rejected}} this explanation. Freud explains that [...] "the associated theory of magic merely explains the paths along which magic proceeds; {{it does not}} explain its true essence, namely the misunderstanding which leads it to replace {{the laws of nature}} by psychological ones". Freud emphasizes that what led primitive men to come up with magic is the power of wishes: [...] "His wishes are accompanied by a motor impulse, the will, which is later destined to alter the whole face of the earth in order to satisfy his wishes. This motor impulse is at first employed to give a representation of the satisfying situation {{in such a way that}} it becomes possible to experience the satisfaction by means of what might be described as motor hallucinations. This kind of representation of <b>a</b> <b>satisfied</b> wish is quite comparable to children's play, which succeeds their earlier purely sensory technique of satisfaction. [...] As time goes on, the psychological accent shifts from the motives for the magical act on to the measures by which it is carried out—that is, on to the act itself. [...] It thus comes to appear as though it is the magical act itself which, owing to its similarity with the desired result, alone determines the occurrence of that result." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chamberlain {{appointed}} a new High Commissioner for South Africa in May 1897. [...] Sir Alfred Milner was {{sent out to}} South Africa with firm instructions to refrain from further unilateral action against the Transvaal. [...] Milner was a dedicated proponent of British Imperialism and of the ‘forward’ policy; viewing it {{as the only way}} to preserve what he saw as Britain’s waning regional influence. [...] February 1898 saw Kruger re-elected for his fourth term, with a substantial majority over his reformist rivals. [...] Milner took this as a sign that {{there was no time to}} lose; if there was any further waiting the result would be Afrikaner dominance to the exclusion of Britain, orchestrated from a powerful Transvaal. [...] Milner returned to London in November 1898 for consultations with Chamberlain. [...] Having observed the situation for the past eighteen months, he was now sure of his strategy. [...] Milner proposed that the British government should work up a crisis, giving them a legitimate pretext to intervene, a pretext that would place Britain in the right and the Transvaal in the wrong in the court of public opinion. [...] Chamberlain re-iterated his instruction to Milner that the British government could not be seen to be coercing Kruger; any intervention must be as a result of the Transvaal putting itself in the wrong. [...] Milner returned to South Africa <b>a</b> <b>satisfied</b> man; while the British government would not act, Chamberlain had not tied the hands of officials in South Africa.
