2500|$|Ishida and Abe {{returned}} to Ogu, where they remained until his death. During their love-making this time, Abe put the knife {{to the base}} of Ishida's penis, and said she would make sure he would never play around with another woman. Ishida laughed at this. Two nights into this bout of sex, Abe began choking Ishida, and he told her to continue, saying that this increased his pleasure. She had him do it to her as well. On the evening of May 16, 1936, Abe used her obi sash to cut off Ishida's breathing during orgasm, and they both enjoyed it. They repeated this for two more hours. Once Abe stopped the strangulation, Ishida's face became distorted, and would not return to its normal appearance. Ishida took 30 tablets of a sedative called Calmotin to try to soothe his pain. According to Abe, as Ishida started to doze, he told her, [...] "You'll put the cord <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> and squeeze it again while I'm sleeping, won't you... If you start to strangle me, don't stop, because it is so painful afterward." [...] Abe commented that she wondered if he had wanted her to kill him, but on reflection decided he must have been joking.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2017, Jack Off Jill vocalist Jessicka Addams {{alleged that}} she was sexually {{assaulted}} by the band's bassist Twiggy Ramirez in their shared apartment while the pair were a couple in the mid-90s. She wrote on Facebook: [...] "He forced me on {{to the floor with}} his hand <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> I said NO. I said it so loud enough, that my friend Pete came rushing in from the other room to get him off of me. But I had been raped. I had been raped by somebody I thought I loved." [...] Manson responded: [...] "I knew Jessicka and Twiggy had a romantic relationship many years ago and I considered and still consider Jessicka to be a friend. I knew nothing about these allegations until very recently and am saddened by Jessicka's obvious distress." [...] Soon after, Manson announced on Twitter that Twiggy had been fired from the band. Several days later, Twiggy said in a statement: [...] "I have only recently been made aware of these allegations from over 20 years ago. I do not condone non-consensual sex of any kind. I will be taking some time to spend with my family and focus on maintaining my several years of sobriety. If I have caused anyone pain, I apologize and truly regret it." ...|$|E

Then I crawled up to the old creaky chair and pulled the rope tighter and tighter still. I was on tiptoe, just one more pull, then my feet left the chair {{knocking}} it over and darkness embraced me as the heavens opened. I woke up in darkness and felt a heavy weight on my chest. I cried out, [...] "Mummy, I am here." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus was {{it with me}} then. I grasped my cudgel {{more firmly}} and unslung my javelin, {{carrying}} it in my left hand. I peered to left and right, but I saw nothing.

5000|$|... "My son wandered {{about in}} this fashion until he fell in with the Six Nations about [...] west of Albany at Onondaga. For the next four years, to his belief, {{he was the only}} white man in the area. He adapted well. Ephraim also became adept with the Indian language, another {{instinct}} which saved his life. One night after drinking with a few Indians, he understood them to say they were going to kill him, because they believed {{he was a man who}} had, in the past, destroyed their wigwams. Soon two of them came and sat down, Ephraim said, one on each side of him. I can't even imagine his fear when one Indian held his arms and the other took the hatchet and told him that he was going to sing his 'death song' and kill him. However, on reflection, it is true that each of my children had extraordinary strengths and weaknesses, and in Ephraim's life, they were one and the same -- no fear. Ephraim understood their culture as well as their language, and he motioned as if requesting a taste of their rum for a final drink. He took the cup and drank a toast to their chiefs, naming them in turn, beginning with Brant Buller. This caused great emotion, and the Indian with the hatchet threw it down, by this sign “burying it” forever with Ephraim. “You no enemy, my brother,” he reportedly said, and the man threw his arms <b>around</b> <b>my</b> son’s <b>neck</b> and, Ephraim said, the man then [...] "wept like a child." [...] From that day, they were as brothers. My son often claimed that his Indian brothers would 'go through fire and water for him and would not do any business without his orders'." ...|$|R
