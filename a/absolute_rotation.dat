40|$|Global image {{orientation}} techniques aim at estimating camera rotations {{and positions}} {{for a whole}} set of images simultaneously. One of the main arguments for these procedures is an improved robustness against drifting of camera stations in comparison to more classical sequential approaches. Usually, the process consists of computation of <b>absolute</b> <b>rotations</b> and, in a second step, absolute positions for the cameras. Either the first or both steps rely on the network of transformations arising from relative orientations between cameras. Therefore, the quality of the obtained absolute results is influenced by tensions in the network. These may e. g. be induced by insufficient knowledge of the intrinsic camera parameters. Another reason can be found in local weaknesses of image connectivity. We apply a hierarchical approach with intermediate bundle adjustment to reduce these effects. We adopt efficient global techniques which register image triplets based on fixed <b>absolute</b> camera <b>rotations</b> and scaled relative camera translations but do not involve scene structure elements in the fusion step. Our variant employs submodels of arbitrary size, orientation and scale, by computing relative rotations and scales between - and subsequently <b>absolute</b> <b>rotations</b> and scales for - submodels and is applied hierarchically. Furthermore we substitute classical bundle adjustment by a structureless approach based on epipolar geometry and augmented with a scale consistency constraint...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{approach}} for a weighted rotation averaging to estimate <b>absolute</b> <b>rotations</b> from relative rotations between two images {{for a set}} of multiple overlapping images. The solution does not depend on initial values for the unknown parameters and is robust against outliers. Our approach is one part of a solution for a global image orientation. Often relative rotations are not free from outliers, thus we use the redundancy in available pairwise relative rotations and present a novel graph-based algorithm to detect and eliminate inconsistent rotations. The remaining relative rotations are input to a weighted least squares adjustment performed in the Lie algebra of the rotation manifold SO (3) to obtain absolute orientation parameters for each image. Weights are determined using the prior information we derived from the estimation of the relative rotations. Because we use the Lie algebra of SO (3) for averaging no subsequent adaptation of the results has to be performed but the lossless projection to the manifold. We evaluate our approach on synthetic and real data. Our approach often is able to detect and eliminate all outliers from the relative rotations even if very high outlier rates are present. We show that we improve the quality of the estimated <b>absolute</b> <b>rotations</b> by introducing individual weights for the relative rotations based on various indicators. In comparison with the state-of-the-art in recent publications to global image orientation we achieve best results in the examined datasets...|$|R

The results of the aluminum plate model demonstrate the usefulness of the changes in the rotation of mode shape as a diagnostic parameter in detecting and locating damage with regard to the plate with different boundary conditions. For identifying damages at a boundary, the method of using absolute difference rotational mode shape data is not sufficient. Thus, boundary damages are best identified when the <b>absolute</b> difference <b>rotation</b> mode shape is given as input to wavelet transform and the coefficients plotted in a length-width plane.

50|$|Centrifugal {{force has}} {{also played a}} role in debates in {{classical}} mechanics about detection of absolute motion. Newton suggested two arguments to answer the question of whether <b>absolute</b> <b>rotation</b> can be detected: the rotating bucket argument, and the rotating spheres argument. According to Newton, in each scenario the centrifugal force would be observed in the object's local frame (the frame where the object is stationary) only if the frame were rotating with respect to absolute space. Nearly two centuries later, Mach's principle was proposed where, instead of <b>absolute</b> <b>rotation,</b> the motion of the distant stars relative to the local inertial frame gives rise through some (hypothetical) physical law to the centrifugal force and other inertia effects. Today's view is based upon the idea of an inertial frame of reference, which privileges observers for which the laws of physics take on their simplest form, and in particular, frames that do not use centrifugal forces in their equations of motion in order to describe motions correctly.|$|E

50|$|For {{the concept}} of <b>absolute</b> <b>rotation</b> to be scientifically meaningful, it must be measurable. In other words, can an {{observer}} distinguish between the rotation of an observed object and their own rotation? Newton suggested two experiments to resolve this problem.

The second is the effect of centrifugal force upon the tension in a string joining two spheres rotating about their center of mass.|$|E
50|$|The {{experiments}} {{suggested by}} Newton are too imprecise to measure an <b>absolute</b> <b>rotation,</b> if any, of the Earth. French physicist Georges Sagnac conducted an experiment that {{was similar to}} the Michelson-Morley experiment, but was intended to observe the effects of rotation.

Foot kinematics of six healthy adults were analyzed through a repeated-measures design including two therapists with different levels of experience and four test sessions.

5000|$|If {{you need}} a {{centrifugal}} force to explain what you see, then you are rotating. Newton's conclusion was that rotation is absolute. Other thinkers suggest that pure logic implies only relative rotation makes sense. For example, Bishop Berkeley and Ernst Mach (among others) suggested that it is relative rotation {{with respect to the}} fixed stars that matters, and rotation of the fixed stars relative to an object has the same effect as rotation of the object with respect to the fixed stars.

To support his views, Newton provided some empirical examples: according to Newton, a solitary rotating sphere can be inferred to rotate about its axis relative to absolute space by observing the bulging of its equator, and a solitary pair of spheres tied by a rope can be inferred to be in <b>absolute</b> <b>rotation</b> about their center of gravity (barycenter) by observing the tension in the rope.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{repeatability}} of an objective image analysis technique to determine intraocular lens (IOL) rotation and centration. SETTING: Six ophthalmology clinics across Europe. METHODS: One-hundred seven patients implanted with Akreos AO aspheric IOLs with orientation marks were imaged. Image quality was rated by a masked observer. The {{axis of rotation}} was determined from a line bisecting the IOL orientation marks. This was normalized for rotation of the eye between visits using the axis bisecting 2 consistent conjunctival vessels or iris features. The center of ovals overlaid to circumscribe the IOL optic edge and the pupil or limbus were compared to determine IOL centration. Intrasession repeatability was assessed in 40 eyes and the variability of repeated analysis examined. RESULTS: Intrasession rotational stability of the IOL was Â± 0. 79 degrees (SD) and centration was Â± 0. 10 mm horizontally and Â± 0. 10 mm vertically. Repeated analysis variability of the same image was Â± 0. 70 degrees for rotation and Â± 0. 20 mm horizontally and Â± 0. 31 mm vertically for centration. Eye <b>rotation</b> (<b>absolute)</b> between visits was 2. 23 Â± 1. 84 degrees (10 %> 5 degrees rotation) using one set of consistent conjunctival vessels or iris features and 2. 03 Â± 1. 66 degrees (7 %> 5 degrees rotation) using the average of 2 sets (P =. 13). Poorer image quality resulted in larger apparent <b>absolute</b> IOL <b>rotation</b> (r =- 0. 45,P<. 001).

50|$|In his Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, Newton {{tried to}} {{demonstrate}} that one can always decide if one is rotating {{with respect to the}} absolute space, measuring the apparent forces that arise only when an <b>absolute</b> <b>rotation</b> is performed. If a bucket is filled with water, and made to rotate, initially the water remains still, but then, gradually, the walls of the vessel communicate their motion to the water, making it curve and climb up the borders of the bucket, because of the centrifugal forces produced by the rotation. Newton says that this thought experiment demonstrates that the centrifugal forces arise only when the water is in rotation with respect to the absolute space (represented here by the earth's reference frame, or better, the distant stars); instead, when the bucket was rotating with respect to the water no centrifugal forces were produced, this indicating that the latter was still with respect to the absolute space.|$|E
50|$|Mach {{took some}} {{issue with the}} argument, {{pointing}} out that the rotating sphere experiment could never be done in an empty universe, where possibly Newton's laws do not apply, so the experiment really only shows what happens when the spheres rotate in our universe, and therefore, for example, may indicate only rotation relative to the entire mass of the universe. For me, only relative motions existâ€¦When a body rotates relatively to the fixed stars, centrifugal forces are produced; when it rotates relatively to some different body and not relative to the fixed stars, no centrifugal forces are produced. Ernst Mach; as quoted by Ciufolini and Wheeler: Gravitation and Inertia, p. 387 An interpretation that avoids this conflict is to say that the rotating spheres experiment does not really define rotation relative to anything in particular (for example, absolute space or fixed stars); rather the experiment is an operational definition of what is meant by the motion called <b>absolute</b> <b>rotation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The idea of {{centrifugal}} force {{is closely related}} to the notion of <b>absolute</b> <b>rotation.</b> In 1707 the Irish bishop George Berkeley took issue with the notion of absolute space, declaring that [...] "motion cannot be understood except in relation to our or some other body". In considering a solitary globe, all forms of motion, uniform and accelerated, are unobservable in an otherwise empty universe. This notion was followed up in modern times by Ernst Mach. For a single body in an empty universe, motion of any kind is inconceivable. Because rotation does not exist, {{centrifugal force}} does not exist. Of course, addition of a speck of matter just to establish a reference frame cannot cause the sudden appearance of centrifugal force, so it must be due to rotation relative to the entire mass of the universe. The modern view is that centrifugal force is indeed an indicator of rotation, but relative to those frames of reference that exhibit the simplest laws of physics. Thus, for example, if we wonder how rapidly our galaxy is rotating, we can make a model of the galaxy in which its rotation plays a part. The rate of rotation in this model that makes the observations of (for example) the flatness of the galaxy agree best with physical laws as we know them is the best estimate of the rate of rotation (assuming other observations are in agreement with this assessment, such as isotropy of the background radiation of the universe).|$|E
