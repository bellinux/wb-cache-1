5|$|Based on spectroscopy, Saturn {{is thought}} to be similar in {{composition}} to Jupiter, but the other giant planets Uranus and Neptune have relatively less hydrogen and helium and relatively more ices and <b>are</b> <b>thus</b> now termed ice giants.|$|E

5|$|It is {{no great}} matter whether those that die on this account be guilty or innocent, {{provided}} we terrify the people by these examples; which generally succeeds best, when persons eminent for learning, riches, nobility or high stations, <b>are</b> <b>thus</b> sacrificed.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> in sundry of {{the cases}} we have quoted as at {{variance}} with M. Comte's doctrine. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> with the application of Huyghens's optical discovery to astronomical observation by Galileo. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> with {{the application of the}} isochronism of the pendulum to the making of instruments for measuring intervals, astronomical and other. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> when the discovery that the refraction and dispersion of light did not follow the same law of variation, affected both astronomy and physiology by giving us achromatic telescopes and microscopes. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> when Bradley's discovery of the aberration of light enabled him to make the first step towards ascertaining the motions of the stars. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> when Cavendish's torsion-balance experiment determined the specific gravity of the earth, and so gave a datum for calculating the specific gravities of the sun and planets. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> when tables of atmospheric refraction enabled observers to write down the real places of the heavenly bodies instead of their apparent places. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> when the discovery of the different expansibilities of metals by heat, gave us the means of correcting our chronometrical measurements of astronomical periods. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> when the lines of the prismatic spectrum were used to distinguish the heavenly bodies that are of like nature with the sun from those which are not. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> when, as recently, an electro-telegraphic instrument was invented for the more accurate registration of meridional transits. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> when the difference in the rates of a clock at the equator, and nearer the poles, gave data for calculating the oblateness of the earth, and accounting for the precession of the equinoxes. It was thus--but it is needless to continue.|$|R
60|$|This {{was true}} enough; {{and now my}} {{attention}} <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> directed, and my senses <b>were</b> <b>thus</b> aided, I confess I did discover certain proofs of footsteps, that would, otherwise, have baffled my most serious search.|$|R

5000|$|Chow mein {{was brought}} to Brazil by Japanese {{immigrants}} and <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> referred as yakisoba ( [...] or [...] ). It fits Brazilian tastes rather than Japanese ones though, and <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> more similar to the North American versions of chow mein.|$|R

5|$|A hadron is a {{composite}} particle made of quarks held together by the strong force. Hadrons are categorized into two families: baryons (such as protons and neutrons) made of three quarks, and mesons (such as pions) made of one quark and one antiquark. Of the hadrons, protons are stable, and neutrons bound within atomic nuclei are stable. Other hadrons are unstable under ordinary conditions and <b>are</b> <b>thus</b> insignificant constituents of the modern Universe.|$|E
5|$|After about 10 days (1–3 weeks {{depending}} on temperatures), larvae hatch and bore directly throughout the pod walls and develop within the seed. Larvae <b>are</b> <b>thus</b> protected from {{biological and chemical}} control. Larval development lasts two to three months. Before entering its pupal stage, the larva cuts a circular cap. After around ten days of pupal stage, the adult emerges from the seeds. Because mating and oviposition are spread over a few weeks, adults can emerge before or after harvest.|$|E

5|$|Arctic terns are {{long-lived}} {{birds that}} spend considerable time raising {{only a few}} young, and <b>are</b> <b>thus</b> said to be K-selected. The bird has life span that was thought be around 20 years, however National Geographic, The University of Alberta & Massachusetts Institute of Technology, concluded in 2010 that more than 50% of this species will live past their 30th birthday. A study in the Farne Islands estimated an annual survival rate of 82%.|$|E
5|$|As is customary, the men's {{marathon}} medals (at the Summer Olympics) or the men's 50km and woman´s 30km {{cross-country skiing}} medals (at the Winter Olympics) {{are presented as}} part of the Closing Ceremony, which take place on the penultimate and the last days, in the Olympic Stadium, and <b>are</b> <b>thus</b> the last medal presentation of the Games.|$|E
5|$|Based on morphology, John McEachran and Neil Aschliman {{determined}} in a 2004 phylogenetic study that Platyrhinoidis and Platyrhina together form the most basal clade {{of the order}} Myliobatiformes, and <b>are</b> <b>thus</b> the sister group to all {{other members of the}} order (encompassing stingrays and their relatives). This finding affirmed that the thornback guitarfish is not closely related to the true guitarfishes of the family Rhinobatidae, a possibility that had long been considered by taxonomists.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "State Shinto" [...] term <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> used to categorize, and abolish, Imperial Japanese {{practices}} that relied on Shinto to support nationalistic ideology.

60|$|It <b>is</b> <b>thus,</b> thou {{great family}} of Sidonia--it <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> that we Gentiles treat thee, when, in our extremest need, thou and thine have aided us with {{mountains}} of gold {{as big as}} lions--and occasionally with wine-warrants and orders for dozens of dressing-cases.|$|R
5|$|Broasting uses a {{pressure}} cooker {{to accelerate the}} process. The moisture inside the chicken becomes steam and increases the pressure in the cooker, lowering the cooking temperature needed. The steam also cooks the chicken through, but still allows the pieces to be moist and tender while maintaining a crisp coating. Fat is heated in {{a pressure}} cooker. Chicken pieces are prepared as described above and then placed in the hot fat. The lid {{is placed on the}} pressure cooker, and the chicken pieces <b>are</b> <b>thus</b> fried under pressure.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{types of}} cheeses require {{inoculation}} of milk curds with fungal species that impart a unique flavor and texture to the cheese. Examples include the blue color in cheeses such as Stilton or Roquefort, {{which are made}} by inoculation with Penicillium roqueforti. Molds used in cheese production are non-toxic and <b>are</b> <b>thus</b> safe for human consumption; however, mycotoxins (e.g., aflatoxins, roquefortine C, patulin, or others) may accumulate because of growth of other fungi during cheese ripening or storage.|$|E
5|$|Competitors in {{athletics}} events could {{qualify for the}} next round of competition in two ways. Qualifying by right was posting a high result in their own heat, and qualifying by result was posting a high result in overall standings. Ranks shown <b>are</b> <b>thus</b> those within each heat, not in overall standings.|$|E

5|$|Dramatic {{declines in}} {{amphibian}} populations, including population crashes and mass localized extinction, {{have been noted}} since the late 1980s from locations all over the world, and amphibian declines <b>are</b> <b>thus</b> perceived {{to be one of}} the most critical threats to global biodiversity. In 2004, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reported stating that currently birds, mammals, and amphibians extinction rates were at minimum 48 times greater than natural extinction rates—possibly 1,024 times higher.|$|E
5|$|Fancy rats {{care for}} themselves, and <b>are</b> <b>thus</b> very {{affordable}} compared to even other small pets. This {{is one of}} the biggest draws to them. Additionally, fancy rats are quite independent, loyal and easily trained, earning them comparison to both cats and dogs. This comparison is merited given fancy rats are considered more intelligent than any other domesticated rodent.|$|E
5|$|Frogs are primary {{predators and}} an {{important}} part of the food web. Being cold-blooded, they make efficient use of the food they eat with little energy being used for metabolic processes, while the rest is transformed into biomass. They are themselves eaten by secondary predators and are the primary terrestrial consumers of invertebrates, most of which feed on plants. By reducing herbivory, they play a part in increasing the growth of plants and <b>are</b> <b>thus</b> part of a delicately balanced ecosystem.|$|E
