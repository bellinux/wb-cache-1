5|$|The SL79 make up 40 of the 72 trams in the system, supplementing {{the newer}} SL95. Following the {{delivery}} of the SL95 low-floor trams in 1999 and 2000, Oslo Sporveier has a pure articulated fleet. The newer series has a greater turning radius, heavier <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> and is two-directional. The radius and <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of the SL95 {{makes it impossible for}} it to operate around Majorstuen, requiring lines 11, 12 and 19 to use SL79-units. With the 1999-extension of the Ullevål Hageby Line to Rikshospitalet, the tramway received its first terminus without a balloon loop, making it necessary for lines 17 and 18 to be served only by SL95 units. These also serve line 13, since it is a continuation of the service along the Sinsen Line from Majorstuen. The SL79 operate on the Briskeby, Ekeberg, Frogner, Gamleby, Grünerløkka–Torshov, Kjelsås and Vika Lines. Each service has a ten-minute headway, giving a five-minute interval on section that are served by two lines.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{use for the}} Di 3 was {{to operate}} the three non-electrified long-distance lines of NSB: the Bergen Line, the Dovre Line and the Nordland Line. Following the {{delivery}} of the first batch in 1957, they were from 2 June used on the Dovre Line, north of Otta to Trondheim, and further north along the Nordland Line to Mo i Rana. The stock was sufficient to replace all steam locomotives on the Nordland Line, and reduced travel time by one hour. From Hamar to Otta, the track did not have sufficient permitted <b>axle</b> <b>load.</b> From the second batch of eight units, five were put into service on the Bergen Line, the rest on the Dovre and Nordland Lines. Necessary upgrades of the permitted <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> {{had been made to}} the Dovre Line and Nordland Line, and the locomotives were in use from Hamar to Saltdal. On 30 November, the Nordland Line was completed to Fauske, and the full length operated with Di 3.|$|E

5|$|The {{first section}} of the Bergen Line, the Gjøvik Line and the Roa–Hønefoss Line, was {{electrified}} in February 1961. This allowed diesel and electric locomotives to haul all trains from Oslo to Bergen. In 1962 the Nordland Line was completed to Bodø, but the increased need for locomotives was more than compensated by the electrification of the Bergen Line being extended to Ål. The first Di 3 ran on the Røros Line in 1964, {{that had previously been}} denied due to bridges with insufficient <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> permits. In 1965, the Bergen Line was electrified, and all but one Di 3 was transferred to Trondheim. A single unit, usually no. 610, was stationed at Finse Station as a snowplow. Along with additional deliveries, there were sufficient Di 3 units to terminate most steam operations.|$|E
5|$|After the {{war there}} was limited {{resources}} for new rolling stocks and upgrades to the line. Multiple units gradually took over passenger trains, and by 1957, no passenger trains to Storlien were hauled by locomotives. That year Stavne–Leangen Line opened, allowing trains to bypass Trondheim Central Station. The new Di 3 diesel locomotives {{were put into}} service in 1961. The last steam engine {{was taken out of}} service in 1971. The introduction of the Di 3 forced an upgrade to the line to allow for an <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 18 tonnes. The opening of European Road E14 in the 1950s caused a reduction in shorter-haul passenger and freight. NSB subsequently cut passenger services to a single daily train, with a Di 3 hauling Swedish carriages through Meråker. Trains continuing along the Nordland Line continued to increase.|$|E
5|$|Proposals for {{a railway}} were first made in 1870. Routes via Verdal and Røros were soon {{discarded}} and the Meråker Line was approved on 5 June 1873. The first revenue services ran in 1879 {{and the line}} was officially opened on 22 July 1882. The line gave a boom to the local economy, allowing for same-day transport of produce to Trondheim. The line has been upgraded several times to increase the <b>axle</b> <b>load.</b> During World War II, the line {{was the scene of}} both the Hommelvik train disaster and the Meråker train disaster. Steam trains were in use until 1971, following the introduction of diesel locomotives in 1961. From 1900 to 2005 Meraker Smelteverk was a major customer, using the line to haul carbide, and later microsilica, from their mill at Kopperå to the port at Muruvik. The Norwegian National Rail Administration plans to have electrified and installed centralized traffic control by 2023.|$|E
50|$|Soon {{after they}} entered service, the front tanks {{of some of}} the {{locomotives}} were modified. While the tank capacity apparently remained the same, the all-up weight of the modified locomotives and their adhesive weight were 4 lt kg less and their individual <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> were different, although their maximum <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> remained at 15 lt kg.|$|R
40|$|Traditional ways {{to acquire}} truck axle and gross weight {{information}} are expensive {{and subject to}} bias, and {{this has led to}} the development of Weigh-¬in-Motion (WIM) techniques.

This paper aims to introduce four methods in determining such dynamic forces from bridge responses. The four methods are compared with one another based on maximum number of forces to be identified, minimum number of sensors, sensitivity towards noise and the computation time. It is concluded that acceptable estimates could be obtained by all the four methods. Further work includes merging the four methods into a Moving Force Identification System (MFIS) ...|$|R

5|$|Three {{days before}} {{scheduled}} services were to start, {{permission to use}} the trains had still not been granted by the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate. The inspectorate had a series of safety concerns, including follow-up on the safety terms for the wheels and axles; lack of documentation of the crew's training; denying NSB's request to have fewer inspections and less maintenance on the trains; lack of consideration of critical events deemed to have a high probability to occur but have a low consequence; lack of a safety inspector for operations and maintenance; and that the trains were so heavy that they would exceed the permitted <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of the lines. Det Norske Veritas (DNV) warned against a possible weakness in the axles. NSB wanted to use an expert from Deutsche Bahn to perform the necessary tests, but limited availability of the expert resulted in the Norwegian National Rail Administration granting a half-year delay of the inspections.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, the {{concession}} for passenger transport between Voss and Granvin was transferred from NSB's bus division to HSD and Bergen–Hardanger–Voss Billag. At the same time, {{the number of}} weekly services increased from 14 to 34. This was largely {{a result of the}} 1975 declaration by Hordaland County Council to support the closure of the line. In 1980, the railway had 60,000 passengers. A halt was opened at Mala in 1981, but then all passenger traffic was terminated on 2 June 1985. Class 64 had remained in use until the end, and there existed no political desire to invest in new rolling stock. Freight transport was retained, at first using El9, and later shunting locomotives {{because of the lack of}} maintenance. From 1 March 1989, all transport on the line was terminated. NSB wanted to renovate the line and continue operations. Among the plans were to transport metal from the smelters in Hardanger via the Hardanger Line to Continental Europe. This would have required the <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> to be increased. Other plans were to extend some of the departures of the Bergen Commuter Rail from Voss to Granvin or operate commercially profitable tourist trains similar to the service provided on the Flåm Line.|$|E
5|$|The Ekeberg Line {{is served}} by lines 18 and 19 of the Oslo Tramway. Line 19 always runs {{the full length of}} the line, while Line 18 does not operate from Ljabru to Holtet during the morning and afternoon. Line 18 connects via the city center to the Ullevål Hageby Line while Line 19 runs onwards along the Briskeby Line. Travel time from Ljabru to Holtet is 7 minutes, to Oslo Hospital is 14 minutes and to Jernbanetoget is 20 minutes. Both of the lines run every 10 minutes during the day, every 20 minutes during the evenings and part of the {{weekends}} and every 30 minutes during early mornings on weekends. This gives a peak service of every 5 minutes along the Ekeberg Line. The service is provided using high-floor SL79 and low-floor SL95 trams. Because of the lack of a balloon loop at Rikshospitalet, Line 18 must be operated with SL95 units, while SL79 units are used on Line 19 because the Brikeby Line does not have a high enough permitted <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> to for the SL95 units.|$|E

5|$|The trains were {{delivered}} late, and {{were put into}} service after the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate had given dispensation from parts of the safety regulation. On 17 June 2000, a train derailed at Nelaug Station after an axle broke. The class was grounded for a month, and the investigation showed both design errors, and lack of proper inspection and testing. After they were put back into service, they {{were not allowed to}} use the tilting mechanism—thus not being allowed to run faster than their predecessors. The construction was reinforced, and in 2004, the tilting mechanism was re-enabled along with higher speeds. In 2007, a train derailed on the Bergen Line, and questions were raised about the trains' ability to operate in snow, however the accident report showed that the trains' front <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> was just as able to cope with heavy snow conditions as the locomotives running on the line, and that the derailment would have been more severe if the same conditions would hit a normal train with less secure connections between carriages. On 16 June 2011, two units were destroyed when the train ran into a fire in a snow tunnel at Hallingskeid Station.|$|E
25|$|With an <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of , the AA {{had reached}} the design limits of size and power {{possible}} with a two coupled axle locomotive type with Victoria's relatively light track infrastructure. Its high tractive effort and limited adhesive weight (due to <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> constraints and only two powered axles) combined to produce a less than ideal factor of adhesion of 3.5. Future VR locomotive designs were based on three or four coupled axles.|$|E
25|$|To {{achieve a}} lighter <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> a six axles / six motor Co-Co wheel {{arrangement}} was required. By 1949, {{the head of}} Electro-Motive Diesel Dick Dilworth was convinced that lighter <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> locomotives would be popular in Australia and other foreign countries. Frank Shea of Clyde Engineering had also negotiated with EMD to build the new locomotive locally, in order to overcome the foreign exchange restrictions. The order was placed in 1951 and the first locomotive was delivered on 14 July 1952.|$|E
