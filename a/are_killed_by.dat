5|$|A small prickly leaved shrub between 0.2 and 3m (8 in to 10ft) high, G. juniperina grows {{generally}} on clay-based or alluvial soils in eucalypt woodland. The flower heads, {{known as}} inflorescences, appear from winter to early summer and are red, orange or yellow. Birds visit and pollinate the flowers. Grevillea juniperina plants <b>are</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> bushfire, regenerating afterwards from seed. Grevillea juniperina adapts readily to cultivation {{and has been}} important in horticulture {{as it is the}} parent of many popular garden hybrids.|$|E

5|$|Baculoviruses are {{specific}} to individual insect host species and {{have been shown to}} be useful in biological pest control. For example, the Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus has been used to spray large areas of forest in North America where larvae of the gypsy moth are causing serious defoliation. The moth larvae <b>are</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> the virus they have eaten and die, the disintegrating cadavers leaving virus particles on the foliage to infect other larvae.|$|E

5|$|Banksia ilicifolia regenerates after bushfire by regrowing from epicormic shoots {{under its}} bark. Follicles open and release seeds after several years. It is weakly serotinous, like eight other Banksia species, {{all of which}} tend to occur in Western Australia's southwestern corner. The other two species of the {{subgenus}} Isostylis <b>are</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> fire and regenerate by seed.|$|E
5|$|Lions {{prefer to}} {{scavenge}} {{when the opportunity}} presents itself with carrion providing more than 50% of their diet. They scavenge animals either dead from natural causes (disease) or killed by other predators, and keep a constant lookout for circling vultures, being keenly aware that they indicate an animal dead or in distress. In fact, most dead prey on which both hyenas and lions feed upon <b>are</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> the hyenas instead of the lions.|$|E
5|$|Native mammals, such as {{the brown}} antechinus and sugar glider, are {{important}} pollinators of B. paludosa. Several species of honeyeaters visit the flower spikes, as do ants and the European honey bee. The response to bushfire depends on the subspecies; subspecies paludosa regenerates from underground lignotubers, while plants of subspecies astrolux <b>are</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> fire and regenerate from large stores of seed which have been held in cones in the plant canopy. B. paludosa is sometimes seen in cultivation, with dwarf forms being registered and sold.|$|E

When the locals find them stranded or nearly stranded on the beach, they kill them and share the meat to all the villagers.|$|E
5|$|Palladium is a metal {{with low}} toxicity. It is poorly absorbed by human body when digested.

High doses of palladium could be poisonous; tests on rodents suggest it may be carcinogenic, though no clear evidence indicates the element harms humans.|$|E

5|$|The {{masked shrike}} feeds mainly on large insects, {{although}} other arthropods and small vertebrates are also caught. Shrikes fatten up before migration, {{but to a}} lesser extent than other passerines because they can feed on the way, sometimes taking other tired migrants. Despite its relatively small size, the masked shrike has been recorded as killing species such as lesser whitethroat and little swift. Vertebrates <b>are</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> bill blows {{to the back of the}} head, and the tomial teeth are then used to separate the neck bones.|$|E

5|$|Collected and {{described}} by Robert Brown {{in the early}} 19th century, Banksia coccinea appears to be most closely related to Banksia speciosa and B.baxteri.
