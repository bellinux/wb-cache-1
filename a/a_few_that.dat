The Academy's decision to not award the film with the Best Picture Oscar has resulted in much criticism in recent years, with many considering {{it as one of}} the biggest snubs in the ceremony's history.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a host of {{geological}} maps of the U.S. produced in the 20th century. Bailey Willis produced a geological map of the U.S. in 1906. George W. Stose produced a 1:2,500,000 scale map in 1932, and a 1:500,000 scale map together with R.W. Smith in 1939. A.K. Lobeck produced a Geologic map of the United States (with text on the reverse side) in 1941 Those are just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>that</b> have been produced. The most recent map being produced is the National Map that is a cooperative project.|$|E

Five Indiana politicians were vice-presidential nominees on the major party tickets in elections held between 1868 and 1916. Benjamin Harrison, an Indianapolis lawyer and former officer in the Union army, was elected the 23rd president of the United States in 1888.|$|E

5|$|Regulating ER {{release of}} Ca2+ at the MAM is {{especially}} critical because only a certain window of Ca2+ uptake sustains the mitochondria, and consequently the cell, at homeostasis. Sufficient intraorganelle Ca2+ signaling {{is required to}} stimulate metabolism by activating dehydrogenase enzymes critical to flux through the citric acid cycle. However, once Ca2+ signaling in the mitochondria passes a certain threshold, it stimulates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in part by collapsing the mitochondrial membrane potential required for metabolism. Studies examining the role of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors support this model; for example, the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 {{has been shown to}} interact with IP3Rs to reduce Ca2+ filling of the ER, leading to reduced efflux at the MAM and preventing collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential post-apoptotic stimuli. Given the need for such fine regulation of Ca2+ signaling, it is perhaps unsurprising that dysregulated mitochondrial Ca2+ has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, while the catalogue of tumor suppressors includes <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>that</b> are enriched at the MAM.|$|E
5|$|Since a {{proposal}} by Butinov and Knorozov in the 1950s, {{the majority of}} philologists, linguists and cultural historians have taken the line that rongorongo was not true writing but proto-writing, that is, an ideographic- and rebus-based mnemonic device, such as the Dongba script of the Nakhi people, which would in all likelihood {{make it impossible to}} decipher. This skepticism is justified not only by the failure of the numerous attempts at decipherment, but by the extreme rarity of independent writing systems around the world. Of those who have attempted to decipher rongorongo as a true writing system, the vast majority have assumed it was logographic, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>that</b> it was syllabic or mixed. Statistically it appears to have been compatible with neither a pure logography nor a pure syllabary. The topic of the texts is unknown; various investigators have speculated they cover genealogy, navigation, astronomy, or agriculture. Oral history suggests that only a small elite were ever literate, and that the tablets were considered sacred.|$|E
5|$|The storm then {{crossed the}} Tennessee state line at 8:28p.m. EDT (0028 UTC), {{and moved into}} Hamilton County, Tennessee, {{striking}} {{the small town of}} Apison at high-end EF4 strength, where multiple large homes were leveled or swept away, 150 others were damaged, and thousands of trees were snapped and uprooted. The tornado then crossed into Bradley County at low-end EF4 strength, moving across the southern and eastern fringes of Cleveland and affecting mainly residential areas, though a few businesses were damaged or destroyed as well. Subdivisions {{in the southern part of}} the city sustained major damage, with numerous houses destroyed and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>that</b> were leveled. Four people were killed in Cleveland, and many others were injured. Several trees were felled in Polk County (as the tornado had weakened to EF1-strength), before the tornado crossed into McMinn County. The tornado re-strengthened to an EF2 and destroyed two houses and a mobile home before lifting south of Athens.|$|E

25|$|In AD 371 Martin was {{acclaimed}} {{bishop of}} Tours, where he impressed {{the city with}} his demeanour.

According to one version, he was so unwilling to be made bishop that he hid in a barn full of geese, but their cackling at his intrusion gave him away to the crowd; that may account for complaints by <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>that</b> his appearance was too disheveled to be commensurate with a bishopric, but the critics were hugely outnumbered.|$|E

25|$|The {{conspicuous}} {{wealth of}} Abbas's own sons, Yasser and Tarek, {{has been noted}} in Palestinian society since at least 2009, when Reuters first published {{a series of articles}} tying the sons to several business deals, including <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>that</b> had U.S. taxpayer support. In a Foreign Policy article, author Jonathan Schanzer suggested four ways in which the Abbas family has become rich. They include monopolies on American made cigarettes sold in the territories; USAid funding; public works projects, such as road and school construction, on behalf of the Palestinian Authority and special preferences for retail enterprises. It was strongly implied that the sons lineage was the main credential in receiving these contracts.|$|E
25|$|Don Isidro was one {{of eight}} Army ships known to make the attempt to run the Japanese {{blockade}} of the Philippines from Australia or the Netherlands East Indies during the largely failed attempt to supply forces on Bataan and Corrigedor. There were small blockade runners internal to the islands, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>that</b> made the run into those besieged locations with success. Only three of the attempts from outside the islands were successful, one being Don Isidro's De La Rama sister Dona Nati. The others were Coast Farmer, making Anakan in northern Mindanao 17 February, and the Chinese ship Anhui that made Cebu City in march. The Navy managed to make some deliveries and evacuations by submarine.|$|E
25|$|In Blair County, {{the path}} {{followed}} Logan Spring Run to the Little Juniata River, then followed that upstream to modern Tyrone. Between {{what is now}} Tyrone and Bellwood, the path briefly crossed the Little Juniata to the west (left) bank, then crossed back again to the east (right) bank. Continuing southwest, the path reached the current site of Altoona and left the Little Juniata, heading south {{to what is now}} Hollidaysburg. There it followed the Beaverdam Branch Juniata River to the Frankstown Branch Juniata River at the modern village of Frankstown and {{the southern end of the}} path. Several paths met at the Native American village of Frankstown, including a Warriors Path that led south to Maryland, Virginia, and on to the Catawba and Cherokee peoples in North and South Carolina.

25|$|On May 29, the Storm Prediction Center {{issued a}} {{moderate}} risk for parts of Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. The outlook included a 10% hatched risk for tornadoes. A separate slight risk was issued for parts of New England. In the main risk area, only scattered weak tornadoes touched down, though a mile-wide EF2 wedge tornado touched down in upstate New York near Schenectady. On May 30, {{for the second}} day in a row, the Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk with a 10% hatched risk of tornadoes, this time for eastern Oklahoma and {{a small part of}} Kansas. Numerous tornadoes touched down in Oklahoma and Arkansas, including <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>that</b> were strong. An EF2 ripped through the Tulsa suburb of Broken Arrow, resulting in severe damage to homes and businesses. A brief EF1 near Tull, Arkansas unfortunately caused a fatality due to a falling tree.|$|E
25|$|In {{producing}} the special, the only existing master 16mm prints {{of the original}} series kinescope films were removed from storage and brought to a Manhattan editing facility that Goodson-Todman Productions rented. There, company employees Gil Fates, Bob Bach, Pamela Usdan and Bill Egan worked round-the-clock for three days to compile the 90-minute special under deadline pressure from ABC network official Bob Shanks. In the process of viewing and editing the films for the special, they accidentally damaged or destroyed several kinescope films which spanned the entire run of the original series, including <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>that</b> {{did not make the}} final cut of the retrospective. In addition, some unspooled film remained on the floor after the group's rented time at the facility ran out. An April 1967 episode featuring Candice Bergen as the mystery guest was lost in its entirety, as was a June 1967 episode featuring both Betty Grable and F. Lee Bailey. Other episodes sustained only partial damage, such as a 1965 episode that is mainly damaged during the mystery guest appearance of Marian Anderson.|$|E
