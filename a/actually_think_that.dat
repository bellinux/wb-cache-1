The monitoring of acute phase protein response has been suggested as an accurate diagnostic procedure in these patients. This response is an aspecific event caused by phlogosis, infections and traumatisms; it is accomplished by the hepatic release of "endogenous leukocytic mediators" (L. E.

40|$|This {{essay is}} part of a wider {{research}} project aiming to define the components of the élite in power during the first ʿAbbāsid period. Our present purpose is to verify if, and at what extent, the sliding among different public roles must be related with the “arbitraire” of the caliph or rather if it would be reasonable to discern in it some automatisms, some unregulated, although already applied paths. For this purpose, we carried out a survey of the figures who had offices in the administration of the ʿAbbāsid state {{during the second half of}} the 2 nd/ 8 th century, i. e. the Barmakids and those who evolved with them on the political scenario. In such initial stage, we confined our survey to the figures appearing in the Kitāb al-wuzarā’ wa’l-kuttāb by al-Jahshiyārī (d. 331 / 942) that is, with the al-Ṣūlī’s one, the most ancient collection of akhbār devoted to the vizirs.

40|$|In {{the text}} of her talk at APO 2 ̆ 7 s forum, Bali, Terrorism & Australia, Dewi Anggraeni takes a {{cross-cultural}} look at recent events THE month following the terrorist attack in Bali has reminded us yet again {{how easy it is}} for a clash of cultures to occur in relations to Australia and Indonesia. One glaring example is how Amrozi, the main suspect in the Bali bombings, was shown on Australian television last Wednesday night chatting and laughing with the Indonesian Chief of Police, General Da’i Bachtiar, then turning to laugh and wave at the cameras. 	The outrage the image invoked in Australia is understandable. In a community still traumatised by the violent deaths of many of their loved ones, it would have been infuriating to see the culprit laughing and waving {{as if he were a}} celebrity, and what is more, to see how well he was seemingly treated by the police. 	What I saw then was a public relations exercise gone wrong. It was obviously done mainly for the benefit of the media, international as well as domestic, because generally Indonesian Police do not have to justify themselves to anyone. Among those who have experienced close encounters with them, it is common knowledge that in the course of their duty they are capable of anything from showing friendships and kindness to meting out harsh treatment to suspects. But rarely do they have to justify themselves. So in Amrozi’s case they wanted to show the world that they had not engineered anything or exerted any pressure in obtaining information from him. Unfortunately in this congenial atmosphere even Amrozi was encouraged to show his onlookers that he had not been mistreated. Moreover, he was very likely eager to show off how friendly he was with no less than the chief of national police himself. So he turned around, laughed and waved. He was not to know that he was destroying the very objective of the whole exercise. Apart from that, If you have been following the news in Australian media about how the investigations into the Bali terror are going, you’ll feel a certain feeling of upbeat, that the investigations are progressing much better than expected. In the meantime, Indonesian media, while going through the motion of reporting of the progress, are relatively lukewarm. Australia and Indonesia, each assesses the case through their own perspective. Let me explain this with an illustration: Imagine you are among an Australian expat community in an Indonesian city. Say in Jakarta. You receive a phone call from a fellow expat that a well-regarded Australian preacher is in town, and that some in the community are going to organise a prayer meeting in one of the expats’ home. You enthusiastically say that you’re definitely going to be there, bringing your bible. 	The prayer meeting is very well attended. And the following day another expat in another suburb has invited the preacher, who by the way, is staying with an Australian family who was previously contacted by a friend in Australia and asked to look after him. 	The preacher then is ferried from suburb to subrub accepting invitations from different groups of expats who are eager to hear him preach. 	My question is, do you think this is a likely scenario? 	This is common occurrence in the Indonesian Muslim communities in Australia. In each city where there are more than ten Muslim families, there is bound to be a prayer group, which also functions as a support network and a comfort zone for the families. In Melbourne and Sydney for instance, there are several. They discuss social problems in their day-to-day lives vis-a-vis Islamic teachings. They discuss the role of Islam in a pluralist society like Australia. And some also discuss issues related to fundamentalism. They even swap good recipes. 	In general, I can say that Indonesians take their religion seriously. Religion is an integral part of their lives and their identities. 	When Abu Bakar Ba’asyir, the alleged spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiyah came to Australia a number of times in the mid- 1990 s, it seems that he fitted into the community routine very easily. He was billeted with different Indonesian Muslim families who looked after his personal needs, including driving him to places. The families who hosted him are not necessarily adherents of fundamentalist Islam, or members of Jemaah Islamiyah. They may have been taken by his strong stance in Muslim solidarity against the so-called Western decadence, or even against infidels; they may have kept notes about his ideas, but that is certainly not the same as being followers in a political sense. Ba’asyir’s sermons may have been recalled by some of these people when the world, despite verbal denials from various Western leaders, Australian included, appeared to become increasingly Islamo-phobic after September 11 last year. On the ground level here, the month following September 11 was not very pleasant for many Muslims. For some time the Muslims here, and in other parts of the world, would continuously make statements that they condemned terrorism, that terrorism was not part of Islamic teachings. All this has not eluded the Muslims in Indonesia, of whom even the very moderate began to feel besieged. Can you imagine if Catholics around the world had to come out and make statements dissociating themselves from terrorism each time there were IRA attacks? Some of those who attended Ba’asyir’s sermons might have begun to reread the notes they had taken, and it is very possible that the contents, against what was happening then, made them feel very uncomfortable and filled them with questions. IN THE meantime, after October 12 Bali bombings where most of the fatalities were Australian, Ba’asyir’s visits to Australia brought on a different kind of recollection among Australian intelligence security people in this country. His visits were seen as building a network of Jemaah Islamiyah, which is reportedly linked to the dreaded Al Qaeda. And as political leaders and many political commentators in Australia seemed to see straight away, the Bali bombings were also part of Al Qaeda terror plan, using its Southeast Asian arm, the Jemaah Islamiyah. Ba’asyir may well have some sympathisers among Indonesian Muslims in Australia. After all, he was flushed out of the country by Suharto’s New Order government, had to live in exile in Malaysia for many years, and is now a teacher and a spiritual leader in an Islamic boarding school in Ngruki in Central Java, Indonesia. To his pupils, no doubt, he is a hero, and the fact that he is in police custody, he is very likely regarded as a martyr. However many Muslims who went to hear his sermons, confess that they felt very uncomfortable because of their contents. For moderate Muslims, many of whom were Islamic scholars, his ideas were much too narrow, as are usually the case with fundamentalist ideas. Nonetheless, Ba’asyir, they admit, stopped short of mobilising his followers to attack non-Muslim physically. He did however, emphasise that you either obey Allah, or you obey Satan. Needless to say that obeying Allah means following the narrow path he had delineated. In all honesty, when you ponder this, is there a big difference between Ba’asyir’s edict and George W Bush’s, ‘you either with us or you’re against us’? While believing that Ba’asyir’s teachings are extreme, not many in Indonesia <b>actually</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he will go as far as being the drive behind any terrorist acts. And apparently the more the United States and its allies accuse him of being a terrorist leader, the less credible the proposition becomes in Indonesia. Tempo news magazine, in its 4 - 10 November 2002 issue, published the results of its opinion poll that week. To the question, ‘Do you agree with the allegations that Abu Bakar Ba’asyir is involved in international terrorist network?’ Only 25 percent answered ‘Yes’. Of the 75 percent who answered ‘No’, further questions were asked. To the question, ‘Why don’t you agree?’ 48. 97 percent answered, ‘Ba’asyir is a convenient scapegoat of the US in its fight against terror’. TOWARD the end of last month till the beginning of this month ASIO and the AFP conducted raids on 15 - 20 Indonesian Muslim families in Sydney, Perth and Melbourne. At least one of them is a post-graduate student whose computer containing her thesis was confiscated. 	The raids, which hopefully have stopped, run the risk of undermining scholarly studies in Australia on aspects of Islam. Immediately after the raids, Indonesian post-graduate students whose theses have anything to do with Islamic movement, considered discontinuing their line of studies in case they were suspected of having documents linking them to hardline Muslims, hence in this atmosphere of ‘caution’, linking them to terrorism. 	The sad thing is, in an indirect way, their studies may indeed link them to hardline Muslims, if they are studying movement which cause people to follow the hardline Islam. Yet this is indeed what should be brought out in the open and discussed in open fora. If the raids have the effect of stifling this kind of studies, they have the potential of keeping the outside world in the dark about the movement; who they are, why they are becoming radical, where they are, and how many there are. Despite what our political leaders say, Islam and Muslims, in the collective subconscious of the Western world, Australia included, are linked to terrorism. A Muslim friend studying in a university in Melbourne related this story. Travelling on a tram to her university she met a fellow student, an American, who asked her about the significance of fasting during the month of Ramadhan. My friend happily explained to her friend who seemed to absorb everything she was saying. When she’d finished however, her friend asked her, ‘Do you think terrorist activities will stop during Ramadhan, then?’ That same day she went to Melbourne Central, and a florist asked her the same thing. She realised that if she were a non-Muslim, with the barrage of headlines we continuously see around us, she would have had the same perception too. ‘How many people read beyond headlines nowadays?’ she asked. Is there any wonder even moderate Muslims become defensive? What is even of more concern is the way this religious solidarity defensiveness overlaps with nationalistic defensiveness. Abu Bakar Ba’asyir, along with the organisation he allegedly leads, Jemaah Islamiyah, now formally listed as a terrorist organisation, were hardly heard of in Indonesia until Time magazine published an interview with a terrorist suspect, a Kuwaiti Umar al Faruq, who lived for several years in Indonesia. In the interview Al Faruq who confessed to Al Qaeda link and to being an activist of Jemaah Islamiyah, named Abu Bakar Ba’asyir as his spiritual leader. He also confessed to having engineered two attempts on Indonesia’s president Megawati Sukarnoputri’s life. The interview itself didn’t cause much of a stir in Indonesia, because to Indonesians al Faruq’s confession didn’t sound credible. The two botched attempts he related were enough for people to think he made the story up. The first man who carried the bomb to murder Megawati was travelling on a mikrolet, a mini bus widely used in public transport system in Jakarta. Before he reached his destination the bomb went off and he badly injured his leg. The second man got sprung at the airport at the security check when the X ray machine spotted his gun. So people in Indonesia were more bemused than anything when the name Abu Bakar Ba’asyir suddenly became a household name. Newspapers and newsmagazines sent their reporters to his boarding school and none of them found anything unusual or outstanding, in brief, nothing obviously incriminating. It was just another rural boarding school, now thanks to the media attention, better known than others. If things stopped at that, Indonesians would have forgotten him and his boarding school within less than a year. But the Bali bombings changed that. His swift arrest really stands out in the context of the usual workings of Indonesian Police, making some Muslim leaders, quoted widely by some media, believe that his arrest was the result of external pressure, namely from the United States. As we recall, the day after the bombings President Bush told the media that Al Qaeda was behind the terror, while the Indonesian Police were still scrambling for mere clues. Contrary to views widely espoused in Australia, not many in Indonesia’s authorities want to seriously hurt Australia. They may have wanted to embarrass Australia for this country’s high-profile role in East Timor referendum, but not hurt it to the extent of what happened in Bali. And we must not forget that Australians were not the only victims, many, many Balinese and other Indonesians died, were badly injured, and probably missing. According to police records, there were 184 dead in total, and 432 injured in total. Of the injured, 300 were badly injured. Bali was a tremendous blow to the authorities, in terms of domestic and international standing. So, many believe that by saying it was the work of Al Qaeda Bush was pointing the Indonesian Police to a specific direction. They only had to concentrate on finding the local connection. And that connection is: Abu Bakar Ba’asyir. And all avenues lead to him. That is the way many people see it in Indonesia. Both Australia and Indonesia see the situation from their own points of view, and the conclusions often clash, making it even more complicated.

She showed us late one {{afternoon}} when we’d had a bit of a crap day. She said, ‘Ah, well I’ve got this song’ and we were all blown away by it. We recorded it there and then and it pretty much stayed like that for the album. I thought the song would sound good with a harmonica on it, but we didn’t really know anyone who could play harmonica apart from Paul Kelly. Katy gave him a call to see if he’d be interested. He was up for it and in town, so it worked really well.

5000|$|In April 2012, Mitzeee {{starts to}} receive {{disturbing}} gifts {{due to her}} celebrity status. Neil Cooper (Tosin Cole) eventually admits to being her admirer but the strange gifts continue, leaving Mitzeee worried and paranoid. Mitzeee makes a live television debut and she accuses {{one of the guests}} of being her stalker, leading to her being dismissed. Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe) is later revealed to be Mitzeee's stalker and she continues to terrorize Mitzeee. Mercedes begins to grow bored and begins to stop but when she discovers that Mitzeee and ex-boyfriend Riley Costello (Rob Norbury) are in a relationship, Mercedes targets Mitzeee once again. A frantic Mitzeee accuses everyone of laghing at her but she is told she is mad. Mitzeee returns to her flat and Mercedes arrives to check she is ok when an extremely unstable Mitzeee brandishes a large kitchen knife, accusing Mercedes of being the stalker. Shenton said of this: [...] "Mitzeee definitely has no idea that it's Mercedes - in fact, Mercedes is probably the last person that she'd suspect. She <b>actually</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> it's Lynsey and accuses her, because it seems to make sense." [...] Mercedes overpowers Mitzeee and knocks her unconscious before she stabs herself, making it seem that Mitzeee has stabbed her. Of the aftermath of the stabbing, Shenton said [...] "Mitzeee is petrified and picks up a knife in the kitchen. The next thing you know, Mitzeee wakes up after being unconscious due to the tablets and the wine. The first thing she sees is Mercedes with a stab wound and there is blood everywhere. Mitzeee doesn't have a clue whether she could have stabbed Mercedes, or if someone else came into the flat and did it." [...] Mitzeee is later arrested and held in custody.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} network security concerns for network administrators is the presence of rogue access points. Rogue access points, if undetected, can be an open door to sensitive information on the network. Many data raiders have taken advantage of the undetected rogue access points to view confidential information. In this paper, we present a rogue access point detection approach. In this approach we are extending the functionality of basic analyzer. It will deeply analyse different properties of WLAN. If required it will calculate statistics and store it in databse. We can use this result to compare next data. Besides analyzing wireless data, some filters are implemented {{that can be used to}} identify rogue APs in WLAN. <b>Actually</b> people <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> analyzer is just common approach but we can use this tool in WLAN in very efficient way ie to reduce time and cost. This topic comes under wireless security Key words: Rogue access point, analyzer, traffic statistics. 1...|$|R
