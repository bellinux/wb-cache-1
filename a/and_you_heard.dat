I can drop in anywhere in his works, read a few pages, and go, Oh yeah, language. It's almost like if you were tuning a guitar <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> a beautifully tuned one and you say, Yeah, that's what we want. We want something that perfect. When I read him, it recalibrates my ear. It {{reminds me of the}} difference between an OK sentence and a really masterful sentence. Babel does it for me." ...|$|E

6000|$|She {{laid a hand}} on the dresser-ledge, [...] And scanned far Egdon-side; And stood; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> the wind-swept sedge [...] And the {{rippling}} Froom; {{till she}} cried: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm William Burke, your mother's cousin. How did {{you leave}} your brother Harry, <b>and</b> have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> from Josephine lately?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Done, sir! Nothing. At least {{nothing to}} make so much of. Just laid my 'and on that black box of 'is--'adn't even opened it, when in 'e came <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>'eard</b> the way 'e went on. I've lost my place, and glad I am of it, for I would never trust myself {{within reach of}} 'im again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{appears to}} be a very {{consistent}} character. <b>And</b> then <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> nothing until <b>you</b> read the reports of the death in the paper?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You heard Lampugnani quip Ramiro {{with the}} fact that three {{messengers}} have ridden desperately within the week from Citta di Castello to Cesena, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard,</b> perhaps, his obscure reference to the hat?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; for {{men like}} you do not tell tales of foolish girls who chance to love them. But if that plan began to work, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> say that kings or princes died, it might be otherwise. You might say, 'I think I know where the witch lives who causes these evils'--in your sleep, Macumazahn." ...|$|E
6000|$|You had {{to blink}} when looked at it; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> a fizzing sound {{just like the}} machine with a [...] "scope" [...] {{at the end of}} it. Yes; there wasn't much repose about the picture of the Turpins' {{domestic}} life. It was something like [...] "Spearing Salmon in the Columbia River," [...] or [...] "Japanese Artillery in Action." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed? Yet nearly fifty winters {{have passed}} over his head, {{and that is}} {{somewhat}} old for a warrior. And my mother <b>and</b> sister--have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> of them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|We've not struck ill, [...] Despite this slip, my lord.... <b>And</b> have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> [...] That Colonel Dalbiac's wife rode in {{the charge}} [...] Behind her spouse to-day? ...|$|R
5000|$|Has any {{citizen in}} your {{knowledge}} failed {{in his business}} lately, <b>and</b> what have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> of the cause? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lousta! Monazi!" [...] he said slowly. [...] "Well, {{you heard}} those names to-day, did you not, White Man? <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> certain {{things from the}} lips of this Monazi who was angry, that give colour to that talk of the Opener-of-Roads. It seems to me," [...] he added, glancing about him and {{speaking}} in a low voice, [...] "that what I suspected is true and that without doubt I am betrayed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Stay again. Had {{you never}} {{the sense of}} a Spirit in you--a will, an energy, an inspiration, deeper than the region of {{consciousness}} and reflection, which, like the wind, blew where it listed, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> the sound of it ringing through your whole consciousness, and yet knew not whence it came, or whither it went, or why it drove you on to dare and suffer, to love and hate; to be a fighter, a sportsman, an artist--' ...|$|E
60|$|You {{tossed a}} blanket from the bed, You lay upon your back, and waited; You dozed, {{and watched the}} night {{revealing}} The thousand sordid images Of which your soul was constituted; They flickered against the ceiling. And when all the world came back And the light crept up between the shutters, <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> the sparrows in the gutters, You had such {{a vision of the}} street As the street hardly understands; Sitting along the bed's edge, where You curled the papers from your hair, Or clasped the yellow soles of feet In the palms of both soiled hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "She did {{not know}} my real name. My father called himself Wood. I never knew {{the rest of it}} till after I came home. That fellow bribed the gardener, got in over the wall, or somehow, and when she saw <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> me and all three of us, it gave her the clue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are right}} enough there, Susquesus. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> fancied <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> {{the stroke of}} a saw, from this place, during the quiet and heavy air of the past night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have read}} the account of this--terrible thing, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> all I can tell you. Doubtless you have formed some idea {{concerning}} it. Would you mind telling it to me?" ...|$|R
60|$|Your Lordships {{witnessed}} the insolence with which this man, stung {{to the quick}} by the recital of his crime, interrupted me; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> his recrimination of falsehood against us. We again avouch the truth of all and every word we have uttered, and the validity of every proof with which we have supported them. Let his impatience, I say, now again burst forth,--he who feels so sensibly everything that touches him, and yet seeks for an act of indemnity for his own atrocities, by endeavoring to make {{you believe that the}} wrongs of a desolated family are within one year forgotten by them, and buried in oblivion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mr. Webster, {{his eyes}} bent thoughtfully on the fire, [...] "you and the Carthew folks {{tried to have}} a mail carrier {{appointed}} some time ago, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> that the authorities were considering your representations. I guess that's about all they did. They're great on considering, and as a rule they don't get much further. It strikes me as curious that they should give you the postoffice now, considering that they wouldn't do it when you worried them for it. The next point is that although I applied the other time I don't know anybody in office or any political boss who would speak for me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Possibly {{the mill}} {{has been set}} in motion by some of your idlers, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> the large saw, which, at a distance, may sound like a smaller one near by." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{liked the}} last tale about the {{children}} who were lost. Shall I tell one about a child who was found? It really happened, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> never <b>heard</b> it before," [...] he asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Atherton!" [...] Wilfrid exclaimed a {{few minutes}} later, [...] "were there any other of the Poverty Bay people there last night; <b>and</b> have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> what took place and whether many besides those we know of have lost their lives?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There's an old well there,' {{said the}} sexton, 'right {{underneath}} the belfry; a deep, dark, echoing well. Forty year ago, you {{had only to}} let down the bucket till the first knot in the rope was free of the windlass, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> it splashing in the cold dull water. By little and little the water fell away, so that in ten year after that, a second knot was made, and you must unwind so much rope, or the bucket swung tight and empty at the end. In ten years' time, the water fell again, and a third knot was made. In ten years more, the well dried up; and now, if you lower the bucket till your arms are tired, and let out nearly all the cord, you'll hear it, of a sudden, clanking and rattling on the ground below; with a sound of being so deep and so far down, that your heart leaps into your mouth, and you start away {{as if you were}} falling in.' ...|$|E
60|$|That {{period of}} my life, and that horrible prison, {{seem to me}} like {{recollections}} of some fever. What an awful place!--not for the sadness, strangely enough, as I thought, but for the gaiety of it; for the long prison galleries were, I remember, full of life and a sort of grave bustle. All day and all night doors were clapping to and fro; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> loud voices, oaths, footsteps, and laughter. Next door to our room was one where a man sold gin, {{under the name of}} tape; and here, from morning till night, the people kept up a horrible revelry;--and sang--sad songs some of them: but my dear little girl was, thank God! unable to understand the most part of their ribaldry. She never used to go out till nightfall; and all day she sat working at a little store of caps and dresses for the expected stranger--and not, she says to this day, unhappy. But the confinement sickened her, who had been used to happy country air, and she grew daily paler and paler.|$|E
60|$|What the Goorkhas and the English did {{will be seen}} later on. The {{heavy work}} lay with the horses, for {{they had to go}} far and pick their way clear of habitations. Many of the troopers were natives of that part of the world, ready and anxious to fight against their kin, and some of the {{officers}} had made private and unofficial excursions into those hills before. They crossed the border, found a dried river bed, cantered up that, waited through a stony gorge, risked crossing a low hill under cover of the darkness, skirted another hill, leaving their hoof-marks deep in some ploughed ground, felt their way along another watercourse, ran over the neck of a spur, praying that no one would hear their horses grunting, and so worked on in the rain and the darkness, till they had left Bersund and its crater of hills a little behind them, and to the left, {{and it was time to}} swing round. The ascent commanding the back of Bersund was steep, and they halted to draw breath in a broad level valley below the height. That is to say, the men reined up, but the horses, blown as they were, refused to halt. There was unchristian language, the worse for being delivered in a whisper, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> the saddles squeaking in the darkness as the horses plunged.|$|E
6000|$|... "It looks bad, I confess," [...] {{answered}} Dechamp, as they paced {{to and fro}} in {{a retired}} part of the camp; [...] "but you must remember that your two eyes are not your two ears, <b>and</b> that <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> nothing that <b>you</b> could understand." ...|$|R
6000|$|Dick {{clutched}} at his shoulder. 'Matter! I've been lying here {{for hours in}} the dark, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> never <b>heard</b> me. Torp, old man, don't go away. I'm all in the dark. In the dark, I tell you!' ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{will ask}} {{what is the}} matter, I thought; or who should? <b>And</b> I exclaimed--'Have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> any good news, Mr. Heathcliff? You look uncommonly animated.' ...|$|R
60|$|By {{the fifth}} of August {{the weather was}} very warm, and on that day, while the Colonel sat {{straight}} and gossiped, Lyon opened {{for the sake of}} ventilation a little subsidiary door which led directly from his studio into the garden and sometimes served as an entrance and an exit for models and for visitors of the humbler sort, and as a passage for canvases, frames, packing-boxes and other professional gear. The main entrance was through the house and his own apartments, and this approach had the charming effect of admitting you first to a high gallery, from which a crooked picturesque staircase enabled you to descend to the wide, decorated, encumbered room. The view of this room, beneath them, with all its artistic ingenuities and the objects of value that Lyon had collected, never failed to elicit exclamations of delight from persons stepping into the gallery. The way from the garden was plainer and at once more practicable and more private. Lyon's domain, in St. John's Wood, was not vast, but when the door stood open of a summer's day it offered a glimpse of flowers and trees, you smelt something sweet <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> the birds. On this particular morning the side-door had been found convenient by an unannounced visitor, a youngish woman who stood in the room before the Colonel perceived her and whom he perceived before she was noticed by his friend. She was very quiet, and she looked from one of the men to the other. 'Oh, dear, here's another!' Lyon exclaimed, as soon as his eyes rested on her. She belonged, in fact, to a somewhat importunate class--the model in search of employment, and she explained that she had ventured to come straight in, that way, because very often when she went to call upon gentlemen the servants played her tricks, turned her off and wouldn't take in her name.|$|E
6000|$|... "This can go {{on without}} you," [...] he said; [...] "Gervaise will see to it. I would speak to you. You were at the meeting this morning, Guy, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> what the herald of France said. The {{position}} is a hard one. I cannot hold the castle against the strength of France, while if we take a Burgundian garrison I should cease to be its master, and it would doubtless soon pass into other hands. Again, if I go to England, it would equally be lost to us. Therefore my wife has resolved, {{in order to gain}} time until these disorders are over, to go to Paris with the children as a hostage for me. In no case, as it seems to me, are Dame Margaret and the children likely to be in danger; nevertheless, I am greatly loth for them to go. However, seeing no other way out of the business, I have consented, and we have arranged that you shall accompany her. You will go as my esquire, and I shall install you as such this afternoon. You will take Long Tom, two of the men-at-arms, and Robert Picard, all good men and true; {{but at the same time}} the burden and responsibility must rest upon your shoulders. You are young yet for so grave a charge, and yet I feel that I can confide it to you. You will have to be the stay and support of your mistress, you will have to be the companion and friend of my children, and I shall charge the four men-at-arms to take orders from you as from me. Tom will be a valuable fellow. In the first place, he is, I know, much attached to you, besides being shrewd, and a very giant in strength. The other three are all honest varlets, and you can rely upon them in any pinch." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{came upon}} them by surprise. Liberal {{friends of the}} precise right shade of colour had assured them, in Mrs. Turner's drawing-room, that all was for the best; and they rose on February 28 without fear. About {{the middle of the}} day they heard the sound of musketry, and the next morning they were wakened by the cannonade. The French, who had behaved so [...] "splendidly," [...] pausing, at the voice of Lamartine, just where judicious Liberals could have desired--the French, who had [...] "no cupidity in their nature," [...] were now about to play a {{variation}} on the theme rebellion. The Jenkins took refuge in the house of Mrs. Turner, the house of the false prophets, [...] "Anna going with Mrs. Turner, that she might be prevented speaking English, Fleeming, Miss H., and I" [...] (it is the mother who writes) [...] "walking together. As we reached the Rue de Clichy the report of the cannon sounded close to our ears and made our hearts sick, I assure you. The fighting was at the barrier Rochechouart, a few streets off. All Saturday and Sunday we were a prey to great alarm, there came so many reports that the insurgents were getting the upper hand. One could tell the state of affairs from the extreme quiet or the sudden hum in the street. When the news was bad, all the houses closed and the people disappeared; when better, the doors half opened <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> the sound of men again. From the upper windows we could see each discharge from the Bastille--I mean the smoke rising--and also the flames and smoke from the Boulevard la Chapelle. We were four ladies, and only Fleeming by way of a man, and difficulty enough we had to keep him from joining the National Guards--his pride and spirit were both fired. You cannot picture to yourself the multitudes of soldiers, guards, and armed men of all sorts we watched--not close to the window, however, for such havoc had been made among them by the firing from the windows, that as the battalions marched by, they cried, 'Fermez vos fenêtres!' and it was very painful to watch their looks of anxiety and suspicion as they marched by." ...|$|E
