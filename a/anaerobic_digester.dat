25|$|An {{example of}} a project using an <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digester</b> {{can be found in}} Chile where in December 2000, the largest pork {{production}} company in Chile, initiated a voluntary process to implement advanced waste management systems (anaerobic and aerobic digestion of hog manure), in order to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.|$|E
25|$|Some offset {{projects}} {{consist of}} the combustion or containment of methane generated by farm animals (by {{use of an}} <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digester),</b> landfills or other industrial waste. Methane has a global warming potential (GWP) 23 times that of CO2; when combusted, each molecule of methane is converted to one molecule of CO2, thus reducing the global warming effect by 96%.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{pre-treatment}} {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the necessary retention time to produce biogas. For example, certain processes shred the substrates to increase the surface area or use a thermal pretreatment stage (such as pasteurisation) to significantly enhance the biogas output. The pasteurisation process {{can also be used to}} reduce the pathogenic concentration in the digesate leaving the <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digester.</b> Pasteurisation may be achieved by heat treatment combined with maceration of the solids.|$|E
50|$|The Animal By-Products Regulations (No 1069/2009) (SI 142/2011) {{allows for}} the {{treatment}} of some animal by-products in composting and biogas plants (<b>anaerobic</b> <b>digesters).</b> The following article describes procedures required to allow solid outputs (compost, digestate) from composting plants and <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digesters</b> onto land in the United Kingdom.|$|R

25|$|The solid, fibrous {{component}} of the digested material {{can be used as}} a soil conditioner to increase the organic content of soils. Digester liquor {{can be used as a}} fertiliser to supply vital nutrients to soils instead of chemical fertilisers that require large amounts of energy to produce and transport. The use of manufactured fertilisers is, therefore, more carbon-intensive than the use of <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digester</b> liquor fertiliser. In countries such as Spain, where many soils are organically depleted, the markets for the digested solids can be equally as important as the biogas.|$|E
25|$|A second {{consideration}} {{related to}} the feedstock is moisture content. Drier, stackable substrates, such as food and yard waste, are suitable for digestion in tunnel-like chambers. Tunnel-style systems typically have near-zero wastewater discharge, as well, so this style of system has advantages where the discharge of digester liquids are a liability. The wetter the material, the more suitable {{it will be to}} handling with standard pumps instead of energy-intensive concrete pumps and physical means of movement. Also, the wetter the material, the more volume and area it takes up relative to the levels of gas produced. The moisture content of the target feedstock will also affect what type of system is applied to its treatment. To use a high-solids <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digester</b> for dilute feedstocks, bulking agents, such as compost, should be applied to increase the solids content of the input material. Another key consideration is the carbon:nitrogen ratio of the input material. This ratio is the balance of food a microbe requires to grow; the optimal C:N ratio is 20–30:1. Excess N can lead to ammonia inhibition of digestion.|$|E
2500|$|Feedstocks {{can include}} {{biodegradable}} waste materials, such as waste paper, grass clippings, leftover food, sewage, and animal waste. Woody wastes are the exception, {{because they are}} largely unaffected by digestion, as most anaerobes are unable to degrade lignin. Xylophalgeous anaerobes (lignin consumers) or using high temperature pretreatment, such as pyrolysis, {{can be used to}} break down the lignin. Anaerobic digesters can also be fed with specially grown energy crops, such as silage, for dedicated biogas production. In Germany and continental Europe, these facilities are referred to as [...] "biogas" [...] plants. A codigestion or cofermentation plant is typically an agricultural <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digester</b> that accepts two or more input materials for simultaneous digestion.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{volume of}} wastewater {{in urban areas}} often leads the wastewater treatment plants to intensify their process using existing equipment capacity. This usually results in the digestion of concentrated sludge in <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digesters</b> employed in these plants.

Therefore, {{it is important to}} understand the hydrodynamics of <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digesters</b> so as to improve their mixing efficiency...|$|R
2500|$|Reported {{scientific}} {{interest in}} the manufacturing of gas produced by the natural decomposition of organic matter dates from [...] the 17th century, when Robert Boyle (1627-1691) and Stephen Hales (1677-1761) noted that disturbing the sediment of streams and lakes released flammable gas. In 1808 Sir Humphry Davy proved the presence of methane in the gases produced by cattle manure. In 1859 a leper colony in Bombay in India built the first <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digester.</b> In 1895, the technology was developed in Exeter, England, where a septic tank was used to generate gas for the sewer gas destructor lamp, a type of gas lighting. Also in England, in 1904, the first dual-purpose tank for both sedimentation and sludge treatment was installed in Hampton, London. In 1907, in Germany, a patent was issued for the Imhoff tank, an early form of digester.|$|E

40|$|Fats, {{oils and}} greases (FOG) are energy-dense wastes {{that can be}} added to <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digesters</b> to {{substantially}} increase biomethane recovery via their conversion through long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs). However, {{a better understanding of the}} ecophysiology of syntrophic LCFA-degrading microbial communities in <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digesters</b> is needed to develop operating strategies that mitigate inhibitory LCFA accumulation from FOG. In this research, DNA stable isotope probing (SIP) was coupled with metagenomic sequencing for a genome-centric comparison of oleate (C 18 : 1) -degrading populations in two anaerobic codigesters operated with either a pulse feeding or continuous-feeding strategy. The pulse-fed codigester microcosms converted oleate into methane at over 20 % higher rates than the continuous-fed codigester microcosms. Differential coverage binning was demonstrated for the first time to recover population genome bins (GBs) from DNA-SIP metagenomes. About 70 % of the 13 C-enriched GBs were taxonomically assigned to the Syntrophomonas genus, thus substantiating the importance of Syntrophomonas species to LCFA degradation in <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digesters.</b> Phylogenetic comparisons of 13 C-enriched GBs showed that phylogenetically distinct Syntrophomonas GBs were unique to each codigester. Overall, these results suggest that syntrophic populations in <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digesters</b> can have different adaptive capacities, and that selection for divergent populations may be achieved by adjusting reactor operating conditions to maximize biomethane recovery...|$|R

40|$|In this study, the {{collective}} microbial diversity in <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digesters</b> was examined using a meta-analysis approach. All 16 S rRNA gene sequences recovered from <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digesters</b> available in public databases were retrieved {{and subjected to}} phylogenetic and statistical analyses. As of May 2010, 16, 519 bacterial and 2869 archaeal sequences were found in GenBank. The bacterial sequences were assigned to 5926 operational taxonomic units (OTUs, based on ≥ 97 % sequence identity) representing 28 known bacterial phyla, with Proteobacteria (1590 OTUs), Firmicutes (1352 OTUs), Bacteroidetes (705 OTUs), and Chloroflexi (693 OTUs) being predominant. Archaeal sequences were assigned to 296 OTUs, primarily Methanosaeta and the uncharacterized WSA 2 group. Nearly 60 % of all sequences could not be classified to any established genus. Rarefaction analysis indicates that approximately 60 % of bacterial and 90 % of archaeal diversity in <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digesters</b> has been sampled.

RESULTS Based on QPCR results, two seed mixes were selected to inoculate two <b>anaerobic</b> digesters: <b>digester</b> (A) was inoculated with a control seed consisting of digestate, manure, and activated sludge; and digester (B) was inoculated with a further methanogen-enriched seed consisting of the control seed with added compost and leachate. Both seed combinations yielded a balanced microflora that is able to achieve a successful startup. However, upon reaching steady state, digester B exhibited lower propionate levels, resulting in lower VFA concentration and increased buffering capacity, indicating greater stability.
