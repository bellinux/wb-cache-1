5|$|In graph theory, a {{bipartite graph}} is a graph whose {{vertices}} <b>are</b> <b>split</b> into two colors, such that neighboring vertices have different colors. If a connected graph has no odd cycles, then a bipartition {{can be constructed}} by choosing a base vertex v and coloring every vertex black or white, depending on whether its distance from v is even or odd. Since the distance between v and itself is 0, and 0 is even, the base vertex is colored differently from its neighbors, which lie {{at a distance of}} 1.|$|E

The Heisman ballots contain a 3-2-1 point system, in which each ballot ranks the voter's top three players and awards them three points for a first-place vote, two points for a second-place vote, and one point for a third-place vote. The points are tabulated, and the player with the highest total of points across all ballots wins the Heisman Trophy.|$|E

Each Clan has adapted to their own terrain; RiverClan, for example, will swim in the river to catch fish, whilst the majority of cats from the other Clans fear and avoid bodies of water.|$|E

5|$|Most spiders that hunt actively, {{rather than}} relying on webs, have dense tufts of fine hairs between the paired claws at the tips of their legs. These tufts, known as scopulae, consist of {{bristles}} whose ends <b>are</b> <b>split</b> into as many as 1,000 branches, and enable spiders with scopulae to walk up vertical glass and upside down on ceilings. It appears that scopulae get their grip from contact with extremely thin layers of water on surfaces. Spiders, like most other arachnids, keep at least four legs on the surface while walking or running.|$|E

30|$|Ao (1992) {{proposes that}} the {{ambiguity}} in segmentation {{can be solved}} by reference to morphophonemic alternation. For example, the plural suffix in English creates the alternation between cat-cats; therefore, [ts] ought to <b>be</b> <b>split</b> into two sounds. In contrast, the onset [ts] in Chinese {{is not based on}} morphology, and so it should not <b>be</b> <b>split.</b> There <b>are</b> questions for Ao’s proposal though. First, in German, the onset [ts] is not based on morphology, and word-final [ts] is sometimes based on morphology and sometimes not. Should all [ts] <b>be</b> <b>split</b> in German? Should initial [ts] be kept intact and final [ts] <b>be</b> <b>split?</b> Or should final [ts] <b>be</b> <b>split</b> only if there is a morphological boundary in the middle? Similarly, in Beijing Chinese, the “diminutive” suffix creates 袋-袋儿 [tai]-[taɚ] 'bag' and so [ai] ought to <b>be</b> <b>split</b> to [a+i]. However, in Chengdu Chinese, the diminutive alternation creates 袋-袋儿 [tai]-[tɚ] 'bag' instead. Should [ai] <b>be</b> <b>split</b> in Chengdu? Clearly, morphophonemic alternation alone is insufficient to solve the non-uniqueness problem.|$|R
