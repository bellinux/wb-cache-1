This second adsorption step causes a change of the aluminum coordination from a tetrahedral coordination to an octahedral coordination. The ammonia coordination to Al atoms is reversible when the material is purged at 413 K. The hydration of NH 4 -form silicoaluminophosphates (ammoniated bridging OH groups) causes a coordination of water molecules exclusively to Al atoms in P-O-Al bridges, leading to a hydrolysis of the framework. Therefore, a hydrolysis of the silicoaluminophosphate framework is hindered if the bridging OH groups (SiOHAl), as well as the aluminophosphate framework (P-O-Al), is covered by ammonia. The latter may support the stabilizing effect of preloaded ammonia on H-form silicoaluminophosphates toward hydration and weak hydrothermal treatments, as recently observed for H-SAPO- 34...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate in vitro digestibility of fiber components of the cattle ration containing ammoniated corn husk. Parameters measured in the present experiment were Dry Matter (DM), Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF) and Acid Detergent Fiber (ADF) in vitro digestibilities. This study was assigned into completely randomized design (CRD) with 5 treatments and 4 replications. The treatments were; T 0 = 70 % Forage (100 % grass + 0 % ammoniated Corn husk) + 30 % Concentrate, T 1 = 70 % Forage (75 % grass + 25 % ammoniated Corn husk) + 30 % Concentrate, T 2 = 70 % Forage (50 % grass + 50 % ammoniated Corn husk) + 30 % Concentrate, T 3 = 70 % Forage (25 % grass + 75 % ammoniated Corn husk) + 30 % Concentrate, T 4 = 70 % Forage (0 % grass + 100 % ammoniated Corn husk) + 30 % Concentrate. Results of {{this study showed that}} the treatments were significantly (P< 0, 05) influence of dry matter, NDF and ADF digestibilities. Increasing percentage of corn husk <b>ammoniation</b> in the ration increased in vitro digestibility. It is concluded that <b>ammoniation</b> with urea to corn husk could increase digestibility and the ammoniated corn husk <b>ammoniation</b> may substitude forage for cattle ration...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the efect of <b>ammoniation</b> on the digestibility of oil palm frond. As treatments, oil palm frond was mixed with difference levels of urea of 0, 3, 6 and 9 % of DM basis. The mixtures were then added 15 % dried chicken manure and the incubated in anaerobic condition for one week. Parameters measured included: fiber fractions content and digestibility of DM and OM. Data were statistically analyed by variance analysis in a block randomized design. Results showed that the treatments gave significant efect on the digestibility. Digestibility of DM and OM of oil palm frond treated with 6 and 9 % urea were {{higher than that of}} treated with 0 and 3 % of urea. The best digestibility was found by <b>ammoniation</b> with 6 % urea...|$|E
