5|$|Senator McCarthy's zeal {{to uncover}} {{subversion}} and espionage led to disturbing excesses. His browbeating tactics destroyed careers {{of people who}} were not involved in the infiltration of our government. His freewheeling style caused both the Senate and the Subcommittee to revise the rules governing future investigations, and prompted the courts to act to protect the Constitutional rights of witnesses at Congressional hearings.... These hearings are <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> national past that we can neither afford to forget nor permit to reoccur.|$|E

25|$|The {{newspaper}} {{has been}} <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> daily life for several centuries.

Some of the earliest newspapers date back to Ancient Rome where important announcements were carved in stone tablets and placed in highly populated areas where citizens could be informed of the announcements.|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} the outside world on the {{existence}} of indigenous peoples and their cultures is described as being very dramatic. In Siberia, only 10% of the tribal peoples live a nomadic or semi-nomadic life, compared to 70% 30 years ago. In Brazil – where Survival believes most of the world’s uncontacted tribes, probably more than 50, live – there are about 400 speakers for 110 languages. For authors such as Daniel Everett, this phenomenon represents a fundamental assault on the existence of peoples, as language expresses the way a group of people experience reality in a unique way, and it is <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> common heritage. Ranka Bjeljac-Babic, lecturer and specialist in the psychology of language, describes an intrinsic and causal link between the threat of biological diversity and cultural diversity. The assault on indigenous customs and traditions is described {{as part of a larger}} assault on life, with its historical roots in colonization. Survival's report Progress can Kill highlights that the invasion of the Americas and Australia by Europeans eliminated 90% of the indigenous population on these continents. The threat of genocide continues.|$|E

The throwback jerseys were used seven more times, three of which took place on St. Patrick's Day.

500|$|A short synopsis, {{including}} a character and a conflict study of Vanaja, was Domalpalli's project submission {{in his first}} semester at the Columbia University in fall of 2001. The story {{was inspired by a}} child's scream upon being separated from her mother in Sophie's Choice. Over the next three semesters, however, the story veered from its original focus of mother-child separation to what Domalpalli later described as a study of [...] "elements of class distinction and conflict that continue to infuse our society and culture even today." [...] Referring to its emphasis, he said the film was also about [...] "fading institutions of folk art, old buildings that are collapsing, things which we should be protecting— which are <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> heritage." [...] Speaking of the need for preservation of Indian culture and heritage, he said that making the film was an opportunity to emphasize the Indian folk arts, too.|$|E

500|$|Judicial review, {{the means}} by which the High Court {{controls}} the exercise of legislative and executive power, is part of the Court's supervisory jurisdiction. The basis of this jurisdiction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in Ng Chye Huey v. Public Prosecutor (2007) as inherent in nature, that is, deriving from the common law rather than statute. The Court noted that this jurisdiction had [...] "existed historically at common law" [...] and [...] "is still very much <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> judicial system". The inherent power of the High Court to review the decisions of inferior courts and other administrative bodies does not, however, extend to co-ordinate bodies. In other words, one High Court judge may not exercise judicial review over a decision by another High Court judge. In addition, there are no provisions in the Supreme Court of Judicature Act which confer on the Court of Appeal the power to exercise supervisory jurisdiction over the High Court or – as pointed out in Ng Chye Huey – the Subordinate Courts.|$|E
500|$|Some media commentators, such as Howard Kurtz and Toby Harnden, criticized {{what they}} {{perceived}} as {{a rush to judgment}} about the shooter's motivation, disputing suggestions that the shooting {{was the result of the}} Tea Party movement or anything in connection to Palin. Paul Krugman wrote an op-ed piece arguing that political rhetoric had become toxic. With renewed calls to tone down political rhetoric after the shooting, Keith Olbermann said, [...] "Violence, or the threat of violence, has no place in our Democracy, and I apologize for and repudiate any act or any thing in my past that may have even inadvertently encouraged violence." [...] Jon Stewart stated that he did not know whether or not the political environment contributed to the shooting, but, [...] "For all the hyperbole and vitriol that's become <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> political process—when the reality of that rhetoric, when actions match the disturbing nature of words, we haven't lost our capacity to be horrified. ... Maybe it helps us to remember to match our rhetoric with reality more often." ...|$|E
