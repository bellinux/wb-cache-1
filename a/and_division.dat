5|$|From 189697 until 191920, the Football League and Southern League ran in parallel, {{and were}} {{organised}} by separate bodies. The Southern League was therefore {{not part of}} the English football league pyramid. In 192021, the Southern League First Division was absorbed by the Football League, thus becoming part of the English football pyramid, initially as the Football League Third Division. From 192122 until 195758, the Third Division South operated as the third highest level of English football, running in parallel with the Third Division North. From 195859 until 199192, Division 1 was the highest level of English football, Division 2 the second highest, Division 3 the third highest <b>and</b> <b>Division</b> 4 the fourth highest. The Premier League was formed in 199293, and since then has been the highest level of English football. Division 1 became the second level, <b>and</b> <b>Division</b> 2 the third level.

5|$|More {{in-depth}} investigations {{were conducted}} by Esther Levenson, Pessia Tsamir, and Dina Tirosh, who interviewed a pair of sixth-grade students who were performing highly in their mathematics class.

Both students initially thought that 0 was neither even nor odd, for different reasons. Levenson et al. demonstrated how the students' reasoning reflected their concepts of zero <b>and</b> <b>division.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{armistice}} {{that ended}} World War I was signed on 11November 1918.

5|$|When {{addition}} is used {{together with}} other operations, the order of operations becomes important. In the standard order of operations, addition is a lower priority than exponentiation, nth roots, multiplication <b>and</b> <b>division,</b> but is given equal priority to subtraction.|$|E
5|$|A finite {{field is}} a set of numbers with four {{generalized}} operations. The operations are called addition, subtraction, multiplication <b>and</b> <b>division</b> and have their usual properties, such as commutativity, associativity and distributivity. An example of a finite field is the set of 13 numbers {0,1,2,…,12} using modular arithmetic. In this field, the results of any mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) is reduced modulo 13; that is, multiples of 13 are added or subtracted until the result is brought within the range 0–12. For example, the result of 5×7=35mod13=9. Such finite fields can be defined for any prime p; using more sophisticated definitions, they can also be defined for any power m of a prime p'm. Finite fields are often called Galois fields, and are abbreviated as GF(p) or GF(p'm).|$|E
