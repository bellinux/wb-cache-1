5|$|Although {{dating from}} 1195 to about 1400, Lichfield Cathedral has an {{interior}} which presents a harmonious appearance, {{much of which}} is due to its having undergone extensive restoration and refurnishing in the 19th century. The nave is very fine and the Lady Chapel is apsidal with very tall windows, giving <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> French impression. Lichfield {{is the only one of}} the cathedrals to have retained three spires.|$|E
5|$|Bach used <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> unusual melody by Caspar von Stieler, whereas he {{based his}} later chorale cantata on this hymn on the melody by Jacob Regnart. The hymn {{is treated as}} in a chorale fantasia, with string ritornellos between the verses.|$|E

5|$|Comets 42P/Neujmin and 53P/Van Biesbroeck {{appear to}} be {{fragments}} of a parent comet. Numerical integrations have shown that both comets had <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> close approach to Jupiter in January 1850, and that, before 1850, the two orbits were nearly identical.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{was officially}} {{invested}} as Prince of Wales {{in a special}} ceremony at Caernarfon Castle on 13 July 1911. The investiture took place in Wales, at the instigation of the Welsh politician David Lloyd George, Constable of the Castle and Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Liberal government. Lloyd George invented <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> fanciful ceremony {{in the style of}} a Welsh pageant, and coached Edward to speak a few words in Welsh.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{percent of}} the English adult male {{population}} is estimated to have died during the war, <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> large percentage by most standards. The impact on the Native Americans was far higher, however. So many were killed, fled, or shipped off as slaves that the entire Native American population of New England fell by sixty to eighty percent.|$|E

5|$|From 1956 to 1976, the 102d was {{commanded}} by Brigadier General Charles W. Sweeney, pilot of the B-29 Superfortress Bockscar that dropped the Fat Man nuclear bomb on Nagasaki, Japan.

5|$|Guepinia helvelloides has <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> unusual appearance, and is {{not likely}} to be mistaken for other fungi. However, the red {{chanterelle}} species Cantharellus cinnabarinus is superficially similar; unlike G.helvelloides, however, it does not have a rubbery and gelatinous texture, and its undersurface is wrinkled, not smooth.|$|E
5|$|Hilda {{gradually}} weakened over cool waters but maintained <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> large {{level of}} circulation. This caused its dissipation to be slower than normal. Tropical Depression Hilda dissipated on August 14. It large remnant circulation continued northwards and eventually passed over California. There were no casualties or damages attributed to this tropical cyclone. Hilda's remnants caused rain {{as far north}} as San Francisco.|$|E

5|$|Statistical {{rating systems}} give Steinitz <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> low ranking among world champions, mainly because he took several long breaks from {{competitive}} play.

Steinitz was unbeaten in match play for 32 years, from 1862 to 1894.|$|E
