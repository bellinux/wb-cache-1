40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{determine}} the extent that social variables influence cognitive development of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants across the preschool years. STUDY DESIGN Participants were VLBW (500 - 1250 g) children enrolled in the Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity randomized trial between 1999 and 2004. We investigated the relationships between 4 potential social advantages: higher maternal education, higher paternal education, caregiver employment, and 2 biologic parents in the same home [...] and gain in cognitive scores. Cognitive assessments were performed at the corrected ages of 18 months (Mental Development Index score on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II) and 5 years (Full Scale IQ on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence III). Cognitive gain was computed by subtracting each individual 18 -month Mental Development Index score from the corresponding Full Scale IQ at 5 years. RESULTS Data were available for 1347 children. Mean (SD) cognitive scores were 90. 8 (15. 7) at 18 months and 98. 9 (14. 5) at 5 years. Multivariable regression showed that higher maternal education, higher paternal education, and caregiver employment had independent and additive effects of similar size on cognitive gain (P <. 001); the mean cognitive gain between 18 months and 5 years increased by 3. 6 points {{in the presence of}} each of these advantages. When all 3 were present, cognitive scores improved on average by 10. 9 points compared with children without any of these <b>advantages.</b> <b>CONCLUSION</b> In VLBW children, a count of 3 social advantages strongly predicts gains in cognitive scores across the preschool years...|$|E
40|$|Background and {{objective}} Lung {{cancer is the}} leading cause of cancer-related death in men and women. It is also the most common cause of brain metastases. A brain metastasis model is difficult to be established because of the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the lack of optimal methods for detecting brain metastasis in nude mice. Thus, the establishment of a Chinese lung adenocarcinoma cell line and its animal model with brain metastasis potency and in vivo research is of great significance. Methods CPA-Yang 1 cells were obtained from a patient with human lung adenocarcinoma by lentiviral vector-mediated transfection of green fluorescence protein. Intracardiac inoculation of the cells was performed in nude mice, and brain metastatic lesions were detected using micro 18 F FDG-PET/CT scanners, small animal in vivo imaging system for fluorescence, radionuclide and X ray fused imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with sense body detection, and resection. The samples were divided into two parts for cell culture and histological diagnosis. The process was repeated in vivo and in vitro for four cycles to obtain a novel cell clone, CPA-Yang 1 -BR. Results A novel cell clone, CPA-Yang 1 -BR, was obtained with a brain metastatic rate of 50 %. The use of MRI for the detection of brain metastases has obvious <b>advantages.</b> <b>Conclusion</b> An experimental Chinese lung adenocarcinoma cell clone (CPA-Yang 1 -BR) and its animal model with brain metastasis potency in nude mice were established. MRI with sense body or micro MRI may be used as a sensitive, accurate, and noninvasive method to detect experimental brain metastases in intact live immunodeficient mice.

40|$|Abstract Background Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) is {{an inherited}} multi-system disorder characterised by chronic airway infection with pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Acquisition of P. aeruginosa by patients with CF is usually from the environment, but {{recent studies have}} demonstrated patient to patient transmission of certain epidemic strains, possibly via an airborne route. This {{study was designed to}} examine the survival of P. aeruginosa within artificially generated aerosols. Results Survival was effected by the solution used for aerosol generation. Within the aerosols it was adversely affected by an increase in air temperature. Both epidemic and non-epidemic strains of P. aeruginosa were able to survive within the aerosols, but strains expressing a mucoid phenotype had a survival <b>advantage.</b> <b>Conclusion</b> This would suggest that segregating individuals free of P. aeruginosa from those with chronic P. aeruginosa infection who {{are more likely to be}} infected with mucoid strains may help reduce the risk of cross-infection. Environmental factors also appear to influence bacterial survival. Warming and drying the air within clinical areas and avoidance of humidification devices may also be beneficial in reducing the risk of cross-infection. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objectives Through a {{long history}} of cancer policies, public health has a {{foundation}} for cancer research and data to use in applying technological advancements for U. S. cancer control efforts. Geographic information systems (GIS) are one technology enabling the visualization of cancer risk patterns associated with incidence, mortality, and accessibility to care. Methods U. S. Comprehensive Cancer Control (CCC) program directors were interviewed from 49 of 50 states to assess use and function of GIS tools for mapping data related to cancer control policies and practices. Interviews were coded to obtain frequencies of response associated with content domains mapped using GIS tools and the perceived relative advantages. Results Significant relationships were found between the mapping of behavioral risk factors, health care services, transportation access, and policy advantages identified by program managers. The mapping of cancer incidence, mortality, and staging, transportation access, and multiple layers of content were found to have significant associations with perceived research <b>advantages.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> U. S. CCC program managers recognize several important advantages relating to health policy and research for use of GIS tools in cancer control efforts. The application of GIS in U.

40|$|Background Pathogens and parasites {{can have}} major impacts on host {{population}} dynamics, both through direct mortality and via indirect effects. Both types of effect may be stronger in species whose populations are already under pressure. We investigated {{the potential for}} blood parasites to impact upon their hosts at the immunological, physiological and population level during the non-breeding season using a declining population of yellowhammers Emberiza citrinella as a model. Results Yellowhammers infected by Haemoproteus spp. showed both a reduced heterophil to lymphocyte (H:L) ratio, and an elevated standardised white blood cell (WBC) count compared to uninfected birds, indicating an immunological response to infection. Infected birds had shorter wings during the first winter of sampling but not during the second, colder, winter; survival analysis of 321 birds sampled across four winters indicated that increased wing length conferred a survival <b>advantage.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> We suggest that the potential impacts of blood parasite infections on over-wintering birds may have been underestimated. Further research should consider the potential impacts of sub-clinical parasite infections on the dynamics of vulnerable populations, and we suggest using declining populations as model systems within which to investigate these relationships as well as examining interactions between sub-clinical disease and other environmental stressors...|$|R

Understanding the impact of any such differences in palliative care is important. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess, by level of socio-economic disadvantage, referral patterns to specialist palliative care and proximity to inpatient services. Methods All inpatient and community palliative care services nationally were geocoded (using postcode) to one nationally standardised measure of socio-economic deprivation – Socio-Economic Index for Areas (SEIFA; 2006 census data). Referral to palliative care services and characteristics of referrals were described through data collected routinely at clinical encounters. Inpatient location was measured from each person’s home postcode, and stratified by socio-economic disadvantage. Results This study covered July – December 2009 with data from 10, 064 patients. People from the highest SEIFA group (least disadvantaged) were significantly less likely to be referred to a specialist palliative care service, likely to be referred closer to death and to have more episodes of inpatient care for longer time. Physical proximity of a person’s home to inpatient care showed a gradient with increasing distance by decreasing levels of socio-economic <b>advantage.</b> <b>Conclusion</b> These data suggest that a simple relationship of low socioeconomic status and poor access to a referral-based specialty such as palliative care does not exist.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{healthcare}} {{research the}} {{randomised controlled trial}} {{is seen as the}} gold standard because it ensures selection bias is minimised. However, there is uncertainty as to which is the most preferred method of randomisation in any given setting and to what extent more complex methods are actually being implemented in the field. Methods In this paper we describe the results of a survey of UK academics and publicly funded researchers to examine the extent of the use of various methods of randomisation in clinical trials. Results Trialists reported using simple randomisation, permuted blocks and stratification more often than more complex methods such as minimisation. Most trialists believed that simple randomisation is suitable for larger trials but there is a high probability of possible imbalance between treatment groups in small trials. It was thought that groups should be balanced at baseline to avoid imbalance and help face-validity. However, very few respondents considered that more complex methods offer any <b>advantages.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> This paper demonstrates that for most UK trialists the preferred method of randomisation is using permuted blocks of varying random length within strata. This method eliminates the problem of predictability while maintaining balance across combinations of factors. If the number of prognostic factors is large, then minimisation can be used to provide treatment balance as well as balance over these factors. However, only those factors known to affect outcome should be considered. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background In 2005, a {{study of}} a group of {{multinational}} health care companies based in Europe and South East Asia explored the strategies being pursued by these companies in relation to the public health care sector (Lethbridge, 2005). The research found that companies in Europe were keen to become more involved in public sector provision. In South East Asia companies were concerned that middle class groups could use health insurance to access private sector health services. All companies were remarkably supportive of regulation, except in relation to ownership. There was also evidence that new systems of public sector pricing would benefit the private sector Methods This paper shows how analysing company strategy using a business tool can contribute to understanding the strategies of global capital in national health systems. It shows how social science methodologies can draw from business methods to explain company strategies Results The five companies considered in this paper demonstrate that their strategies have many dimensions, which fit into Porter’s Five Forces of comparative <b>advantage.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> The process of examining the strategic objectives of five health care companies shows that a business tool can highlight the actions and motives of health care companies towards public health care systems, in a different light, particularly the strategies of global capital in national health systems. Health service commissioners need to understand this dynamic process, which will evolve as the nature of public health care systems change...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{frontal lobe}} has been {{associated}} {{to a wide range}} of cognitive control functions and is also vulnerable to degeneration in old age. A recent study by Thomsen and colleagues showed a difference between a young and old sample in grey matter density and activation in the left middle frontal cortex (MFC) and performance on a dichotic listening task. The present study investigated this brain behaviour association within a sample of healthy older individuals, and predicted a positive correlation between performance in a condition requiring executive attention and measures of grey matter structure of the posterior left MFC. Methods A dichotic listening forced attention paradigm was used to measure attention control functions. Subjects were instructed to report only the left or the right ear syllable of a dichotically presented consonant-vowel syllable pair. A conflict situation appears when subjects are instructed to report the left ear stimulus, caused by the conflict with the bottom-up, stimulus-driven right ear advantage. Overcoming this processing conflict was used as a measure of executive attention. Thickness and volumes of frontal lobe regions were derived from automated segmentation of 3 D magnetic resonance image acquisitions. Results The results revealed a statistically significant positive correlation between the thickness measure of the left posterior MFC and performance on the dichotic listening measures of executive attention. Follow-up analyses showed that this correlation was only statistically significant in the subgroup that showed the typical bottom-up, stimulus-driven right ear <b>advantage.</b> <b>Conclusion</b> The results suggest that the left MFC is a part of an executive attention network, and that the dichotic listening forced attention paradigm may be a feasible tool for assessing subtle attentional dysfunctions in older adults. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground The {{analysis}} of gene function {{based on the}} generation of mutant mice by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells is limited if gene disruption results in embryonic lethality. Mosaic mice, which contain a certain proportion of mutant cells in all organs, allow lethality to be circumvented and the potential of mutant cells to contribute to different cell lineages to be analyzed. To generate mosaic animals, we used the bacteriophage P 1 -derived Cre–loxP recombination system, which allows gene alteration by Cre-mediated deletion of loxP-flanked gene segments. Results We generated nestin–cre transgenic mouse lines, which expressed the Cre recombinase {{under the control of}} the rat nestin promoter and its second intron enhancer. In crosses to animals carrying a loxP-flanked target gene, partial deletion of the loxP-flanked allele occurred before day 10. 5 post coitum and was detectable in all adult organs examined, including germ-line cells. Using this approach, we generated mosaic mice containing cells deficient in the γ-chain of the interleukin- 2 receptor (IL- 2 Rγ); in these animals, the IL- 2 Rγ-deficient cells were underrepresented in the thymus and spleen. Because mice deficient in DNA polymerase β die perinatally, we studied the effects of DNA polymerase β deficiency in mosaic animals. We found that some of the mosaic polymerase β-deficient animals were viable, but were often reduced in size and weight. The fraction of DNA polymerase β-deficient cells in mosaic embryos decreased during embryonic development, presumably because wild-type cells had a competitive <b>advantage.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> The nestin–cre transgenic mice can be used to generate mosaic animals in which target genes are mutated by Cre-mediated recombination of loxP-flanked target genes. By using mosaic animals, embryonic lethality can be bypassed and cell lineages for whose development a given target gene is critical can be identified. In the case of DNA polymerase β, deficient cells are already selected against during embryonic development, demonstrating the general importance of this protein in multiple cell types...|$|R

40|$|Background BCG is a prototypal cancer immunotherapeutic factor {{currently}} {{approved of}} bladder cancer. In attempt {{to further enhance}} the effectiveness of immunotherapy of bladder cancer and, potentially, other malignancies, we evaluated the impact of BCG on local production of chemokines attracting the desirable effector CD 8 + T cells (CTLs) and undesirable myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSCs) and regulatory T(reg) cells, {{and the ability of}} bladder cancer tissues to attract CTLs. Methods Freshly resected bladder cancer tissues were either analyzed immediately or cultured ex vivo in the absence or presence of the tested factors. The expression of chemokine genes, secretion of chemokines and their local sources in freshly harvested and ex vivo-treated tumor explants were analyzed by quantitative PCR (Taqman), ELISAs and immunofluorescence/confocal microscopy. Migration of CTLs was evaluated ex vivo, using 24 -transwell plates. Spearman correlation was used for correlative analysis, while paired Students T test or Wilcoxon was used for statistical analysis of the data. Results Bladder cancer tissues spontaneously expressed high levels of the granulocyte/MDSC-attractant CXCL 8 and Treg-attractant CCL 22, but only marginal levels of the CTL-attracting chemokines: CCL 5, CXCL 9 and CXCL 10. Baseline CXCL 10 showed strong correlation with local expression of CTL markers. Unexpectedly, BCG selectively induced only the undesirable chemokines, CCL 22 and CXCL 8, but had only marginal impact on CXCL 10 production. In sharp contrast, the combination of IFNα and a TLR 3 ligand, poly-I:C (but not the combinations of BCG with IFNα or BCG with poly-I:C), induced high levels of intra-tumoral production of CXCL 10 and promoted CTL attraction. The combination of BCG with IFNα[*]+[*]poly-I:C regimen did not show additional <b>advantage.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> The current data indicate that suboptimal ability of BCG to reprogram cancer-associated chemokine environment may be a factor limiting its therapeutic activity. Our observations that the combination of BCG with (or replacement by) IFNα and poly-I:C allows to reprogram bladder cancer tissues for enhanced CTL entry may provide for new methods of improving the effectiveness of immunotherapy of bladder cancer, helping to extend BCG applications to its more advanced forms, and, potentially, other diseases...|$|R
40|$|Background : Recent trends show an {{unprecedented}} feminisation of migration in China, {{triggered by the}} increasing demand for cheap labour in big cities {{and the availability of}} women in the labour market. These trends corroborate the evidence that non-agricultural work and remittance from urban labour migrants have become the major sources of rural household income. Objective : This paper investigates the extent of gender inequalities in job participation and wage earning among internal labour migrants in China. We hypothesize that female migrants in cities are economically more disadvantaged than male migrants in the job market. Methods : We use data from the 2010 National Migrant Dynamics Monitoring Survey conducted in 106 cities representing all 31 provinces and geographic regions. The study applies the standard Heckman two-step Probit-OLS method to model job participation and wage-earning, separately for 59, 225 males and 41, 546 females aged 16 - 59 years, adjusting for demographic and social characteristics and potential selection effects. Results : Female migrants have much lower job-participation and wage-earning potential than male migrants. Male migrants earn 26 Š higher hourly wages than their female counterparts. Decomposition analysis confirms potential gender discrimination, suggesting that 88 Š of the gender difference in wages (or 12 Š of female migrant wage) is due to discriminatory treatment of female migrants in the Chinese job market. Migrants with rural hukou status have a smaller chance of participation in the job market and they earn lower wages than those with urban hukou, regardless of education <b>advantage.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> : There is evidence of significant female disadvantage among internal labour migrants in the job market in Chinese cities. Household registration by urban and rural areas, as controlled by the hukou status, partly explains the differing job participation and wage earning among female labour migrants in urban China. Comments : Female migrants have higher opportunity costs and family constraints to participate in job market than male migrants. Higher job participation among male migrants suggests that men face stiff competition for jobs in cities {{and are more likely to}} accept jobs with a lower wage offer...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background A {{subset of}} lung cancer {{patients}} harbour EGFR somatic mutations in their tumours and are candidates for treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In a few cases EGFR mutations have also {{been found in the}} germ line, suggesting a role in lung carcinogenesis. Objetives of this study were: 1) To analyze the EGFR gene mutations in a population diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma from Northern Spain. 2) To determine the frequency of a new germ-line mutation found in our laboratory as well as the frequency in our population of three other EGFR germ-line mutations detected by other authors. 3) To determine whether the novel mutation detected may have a functional effect on the EGFR protein. Methods Tumour DNA samples were obtained from frozen or paraffin embedded tumour tissues. Samples of DNA from peripheral blood cells were obtained from 912 individuals with lung cancer recruited from the CAPUA study 1 2, 477 unrelated healthy donor individuals and 32 individuals with other types of cancer. EGFR gene exons 18 to 21 were studied by direct standard dideoxy sequencing. Specific mutations were determined either by direct sequencing or by specific RFLP analysis. Cell lines were transfected with EGFR -mutant plasmids and analysed by western blot with antibodies specific for total or phosphorylated-EGFR. Results We found EGFR mutation in 12 of the 71 tumour samples (17 %). One tumour contained two mutations. One mutation (p. R 776 G) was present as a germ line. Using an RFLP analysis, this mutation was not found in 954 alleles from healthy individuals studied, concluding {{that it is not a}} polymorphism. The mutation was not found either in genomic DNA from 912 lung cancer patients. Three additional EGFR germ-line mutations that were already described were not found in any of the studied samples. These observations show that EGFR mutated alleles are rare in the population. In vitro studies revealed that tyrosine autophosphorylation is enhanced in p. R 776 G-mutant EGFR when compared with wild-type EGFR. This enhanced autophosphorylation in the absence of ligand may be associated with a proliferative <b>advantage.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> Germ-line mutations in EGFR are rare but may contribute to oncogenesis</p...|$|R
40|$|Section A is a {{systematic}} review of emotional processing {{in people with}} Anorexia Nervosa (AN). By drawing together all self-report research, it outlines the specific emotional processing difficulties experienced by this population. It concludes that theoretical assertions that poor emotional processing maintains AN are tentatively empirically supported, but data is limited and largely cross-sectional. Section B Background. Effective treatments for AN in adults remain elusive. Recent research suggests poor socio-emotional and neurocognitive functioning may act as underpinning maintaining mechanisms for AN. These difficulties are therefore indicated as treatment targets; however, their roles as maintaining factors {{and the benefits of}} including socio-emotional and neurocognitive difficulties as foci for therapy lack empirical evidence. Methods. A randomised control trial design was employed to compare the Maudsley AN Treatment for Adults (MANTRA) based on a novel maintenance model of AN seeking to target key socio-emotional factors (maladaptive emotion beliefs and over-control of emotion, alongside poor social cognition) and neurocognitive factors (poor set-shifting and extreme detail-focus), against a control treatment mimicking treatment as usual (specialist supportive clinical management; SSCM). It was hypothesised that: (1) baseline socio-emotional and neurocognitive difficulties would predict outcomes, highlighting their role as maintenance factors; and (2) MANTRA would significantly improve these factors over SSCM leading to better clinical outcomes, therefore confirming them ‘causal’ maintenance factors. Results. Emotional avoidance (behavioural/cognitive avoidance, low acceptance) and some other elements of control (submissive behaviour) predicted clinical outcomes. Social cognitive (emotion recognition, emotional Theory of Mind) and neurocognitive functioning (set-shifting, detail-focus) had limited predictive ability. There were socio-emotional (social comparison, cognitive avoidance) and neurocognitive (set-shifting) improvements following MANTRA over SSCM, but no clinical <b>advantage.</b> <b>Conclusions.</b> Emotional avoidance and submissive behaviours may represent maintenance factors for AN. Social cognitive and neurocognitive variables appear less important. No ‘causal’ maintenance factors could be concluded from the data. Implications for adapting MANTRA are discussed.

Ten participants practiced exploration of nine blocks of 24 virtual objects distributed over three days. The result was that the performance for a majority improved during this practice, but that there were large individual differences. It was suggested that one of the modes has some <b>advantage.</b> A main <b>conclusion</b> {{is that there is a}} high risk that studies of displays with users without practice underestimate their usefulness...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. The International Monetary Fund {{encourages}} {{privatization of}} state-owned tobacco industries. Privatization tends to lower cigarette prices, which encourages consumption. This could be countered with effective tax policies. We explored how investment by British American Tobacco (BAT) influenced tax policy in Uzbekistan during privatization there. Methods. We obtained internal documents from BAT and analyzed them using a hermeneutic process {{to create a}} chronology of events. Results. BAT thoroughly redesigned the tobacco taxation system in Uzbekistan. It secured (1) a reduction of approximately 50 % in the excise tax on cigarettes, (2) an excise system to benefit its brands and disadvantage those of its competitors (particularly Philip Morris), and (3) a tax stamp system from which it hoped to be exempted, because this would likely facilitate its established practice of cigarette smuggling and further its competitive <b>advantage</b> [...] <b>Conclusions.</b> Privatization can endanger effective tobacco excise policies. The International Monetary Fund should review its approach to privatization and differentiate the privatization of an industry whose product kills from privatization of other industries...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background New {{drugs are}} {{generally}} claimed {{to represent a}} therapeutic innovation. However, scientific evidence of a substantial clinical advantage is often lacking. This {{may be the result}} of using inadequate control groups or surrogate outcomes only in the clinical trials. In view of this, EVITA was developed as a user-friendly transparent tool for the early evaluation of the additional therapeutic value of a new drug. Methods EVITA does not evaluate a new compound per se but in an approved indication in comparison with existing therapeutic strategies. Placebo as a comparator is accepted only in the absence of an established therapy or if employed in an add-on strategy on top. The evaluation attributes rating points to the drug in question, taking into consideration both therapeutic benefit and risk profile. The compound scores positive points for superiority in efficiency and/or adverse effects as demonstrated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), whilst negative points are awarded for inferiority and/or an unfavorable risk profile. The evaluation follows an algorithm considering the clinical relevance of the outcomes, the strength of the therapeutic effect and the number of RCTs performed. Categories for therapeutic aim and disease severity, although essential parts of the EVITA assessment, are attributed but do not influence the EVITA score which is presented as a color-coded bar graph. In case the available data were unsuitable for an EVITA calculation, a traffic-type yield sign is assigned instead to criticize such practice. The results are presented online [URL] together with all RCTs considered as well as the reasons for excluding a given RCT from the evaluation. This allows for immediate revision in response to justified criticism and simplifies the inclusion of new data. Results As examples, four compounds which received approval within the last years were evaluated for one of their clinical indications: lenalidomide, pioglitazone, bupropion and zoledronic acid. Only the first achieved an EVITA score above zero indicating therapeutic <b>advantage.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> The strength of EVITA appears to lie in its speedy assessment of the potential therapeutic advantage of a new drug for a given indication. At the same time, this approach draws attention to the typical deficits of data used for drug approval. EVITA is not intended to replace classical health technology assessment reports but rather serves as a screening tool in the sense of horizon scanning. </p...|$|R
