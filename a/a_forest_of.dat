25|$|A {{memorial}} {{was planned}} {{in the immediate}} aftermath of the attacks and destruction of the World Trade Center for the victims, including those involved in rescue operations. The winner of the World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition was Israeli architect Michael Arad of Handel Architects, a New York- and San Francisco-based firm.

25|$|The natural {{vegetation}} {{of the area}} is <b>a</b> <b>forest</b> <b>of</b> pine and oak trees. However, most of the surrounding hills have lost their native trees, with deforestation rates at 80%, losing 15,000 hectares just since 1980. Reasons for this include cutting for firewood, urban development, poor resource management, fires and agriculture. The deforestation has led to erosion problems blocking rivers and streams and affecting underground recharge of the area's freshwater springs. It has also negatively affected endangered species such as the golden-cheeked warbler (Dendroica chrysoparia), which winters here.|$|E

The mud-covered, rodier-palm roof is supported by nine interior walls running north-south which are pierced by pointed arches that reach up almost to the roof. This design creates <b>a</b> <b>forest</b> <b>of</b> ninety massive rectangular pillars that span the interior prayer hall and severely reduce the field of view. The small, irregularly-positioned windows on the north and south walls allow little natural light to reach the interior of the hall. The floor is composed of sandy earth.|$|E

25|$|Names {{of trees}} or {{plantations}} are also locative surnames, originally related to identifying {{a person who}} lived near or inside a plantation, an orchard or a place with a characteristic kind of vegetation. Names such as Silva and Matos (woods, forest), Campos (grass fields, prairie), Teixeira (a place covered with yew trees), Queirós (a kind of grass), Cardoso (a place covered with cardos, i.e. with cardoons or thistles), Correia (a place covered with corriolas or correas, a kind of plant), Macedo (an apple tree garden), and Azevedo (<b>a</b> <b>forest</b> <b>of</b> azevinho, i.e. a holly wood) fit this pattern.|$|E

Leijpark is famous for Festival Mundial and lies next to St. Elisabeth {{hospital}} and a monastery, the Cenakel.

Out of the municipality, there's a national park called Loonse en Drunense Duinen which includes dunes of drift sand from the west coast.|$|E
25|$|The {{plans were}} brought to Robertson, who feeling unwell had dined with Maurice in his room, at around 9pm. In Spears’ famous account Robertson’s face “went the colour of {{mahogany}} … his eyebrows slanted outwards like <b>a</b> <b>forest</b> <b>of</b> bayonets held at the charge – in fact he showed every sign of having a fit” He shouted “Get ‘Aig!”. Haig and Robertson visited Lloyd George – one of Robertson’s objections was that the agreement could not be binding on Dominion troops – who told them {{that he had the}} authority of the War Cabinet and that, although Nivelle’s demands were “excessive”, they must have a scheme agreed by 8am. The next morning, after Nivelle had claimed he had not personally drawn up the scheme and professed astonishment that the British generals had not already been told of it, Robertson “ramped up and down the room, talking about the horrible idea of putting “the wonderful army” under a Frenchman, swearing he would never serve under one, nor his son either, and that no-one could order him to”. Hankey drew up a compromise rather than see Haig and Robertson resign, with Haig still under Nivelle's orders but with tactical control of British forces and right of appeal to the War Cabinet. Robertson later (3 March) regretted even agreeing to this.|$|E
