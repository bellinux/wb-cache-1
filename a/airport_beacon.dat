2500|$|On 17 September 2011, the MAK {{released}} {{further information}} about its investigation. It found the aircraft had started its takeoff with approximately [...] of usable runway length from its starting position. The aircraft {{started down the}} runway with engines at nominal thrust, with takeoff thrust not being applied until six seconds later. Despite the increase of thrust the aircraft did not accelerate as expected. The committee report speculated that {{this could have been}} due to some braking force, and the committee stated it would send the braking system components to a [...] "specialized institution" [...] for a special examination. The aircraft reached a maximum speed of [...] It did not lift off the ground until some [...] {{after the end of the}} runway but at no point did it rise more than [...] off the ground. It then hit the <b>airport</b> <b>beacon,</b> deflected to the left and impacted the ground. The flaps and slats were in takeoff position, spoilers retracted, and the stabilizer set in a ten-degree position. The elevator controls were still connected.|$|E
50|$|The airport {{also has}} an <b>airport</b> <b>beacon,</b> but hills - {{especially}} the one to the north - can limit its ability to be viewed.|$|E
50|$|Military <b>airport</b> <b>beacons</b> flash {{alternately}} {{white and}} green, but are differentiated from civil beacons by two quick white flashes between the green flashes.|$|R
50|$|A {{sectional}} chart shows topographical {{features that are}} important to aviators, such as terrain elevations, ground features identifiable from altitude (rivers, dams, bridges, buildings, etc.), and ground features useful to pilots (<b>airports,</b> <b>beacons,</b> landmarks, etc.). The chart also shows information on airspace classes, ground-based navigation aids, radio frequencies, longitude and latitude, navigation waypoints, navigation routes.|$|R
50|$|In {{the nearby}} Town of Wappinger, the Dutchess County Airport {{services}} local commuter flights. The nearest major <b>airport</b> to <b>Beacon</b> is Stewart International Airport about 10 minutes away, in Newburgh.|$|R
5000|$|At some {{locations}} with {{operating control}} towers, Air Traffic Control (ATC) personnel turn the beacon {{on or off}} with controls in the tower. At many airports the <b>airport</b> <b>beacon</b> is turned on by a photoelectric cell or time clocks, and ATC personnel cannot control them.|$|E
50|$|This {{airport is}} {{included}} in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011-2015, which categorized it as a general aviation facility. In 2010 the airport received a $88,997 Federal Aviation Administration Airport Improvement Program grant to rehabilitate the <b>airport</b> <b>beacon</b> and to fund the installation of a water system.|$|E
50|$|Also under {{construction}} are a terminal building measuring 2380 m2 with {{a capacity of}} 100 passengers, a car park for 80 vehicles and a fire station cum Air Traffic Control Tower. The airport {{is expected to have}} navigation facilities such as NDB, DVOR, High Intensity Runway Lights (HIRL), <b>airport</b> <b>beacon,</b> and a PAPI.|$|E
50|$|The villain of Die Hard 2 {{changes the}} Dulles <b>Airport's</b> ATC <b>beacon</b> {{altitude}} to below ground level, causing planes' altimeters to provide false readings, thus causing landing planes to crash.|$|R
25|$|Mitchell Gallery of Flight, at General Mitchell International Airport, Milwaukee's {{aviation}} {{and historical}} enthusiasts experience {{the history of}} General Mitchell International Airport with {{a visit to the}} Gallery of Flight. Exhibits include General Billy Mitchell; replicas of past and present aircraft including the Lawson Airline, the first commercial airliner; the Graf Zeppelin II, the sistership to the tragically legendary Hindenburg; a 1911 Curtis Pusher, an airplane with the propeller {{in the rear of the}} plane; and the present day giant of the sky, the 747. Other exhibits include commercial air memorabilia, early aviation engines and <b>airport</b> <b>beacons.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{breakdown}} in communications followed, causing Gen. Earp of the South African Air Force to authorise military pilots to penetrate Mozambique airspace {{to test the}} Matsapa theory. They returned with confirmation, though the final report relied on additional testimonies of commercial pilots who flew on C9-CAA's track. They likewise confirmed clear VOR signals from Matsapa. Mozambican pilot Dias, who supported the Matsapa theory, illustrated his interpretation of events to Mozambican officials on a flight from Lisbon to Maputo. Mozambican authorities however remained unconvinced and suspended air controller de Jesus on 5 May 1998, for allegedly having been bribed to tamper with Maputo <b>airport's</b> <b>beacon</b> {{on the night of}} the crash.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also a}} small {{municipal}} airport (FAA code 1F4) named Madill Municipal Airport, 3 miles km {{northwest of}} the city. It has one asphalt runway, 18/36, that is 3000 feet m by 60 feet m at elevation 862 feet m. The <b>airport</b> <b>beacon</b> operates between sunrise and sunset every day. There is no control tower.|$|E
50|$|In Class B, Class C, Class D, and Class E surface areas, {{operation}} of the <b>airport</b> <b>beacon</b> during the hours of daylight often indicates that the ground visibility is less than 3 miles and/or the ceiling is less than 1,000 feet. Regardless of the weather conditions, the FAA has no regulation that requires airports to turn the beacon on during the day.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} part of 1969, a new High Intensity Lighting system (HIRL) was {{installed}} on runway 6/24 as well as lighting on the parallel taxiway. A new taxiway, complete with lighting, was constructed parallel to runway 1/19. In the same improvements project, runway 6/24 was overlaid for the purpose of increasing the pavementstrength and a new 36-inch <b>Airport</b> <b>Beacon</b> was installed.|$|E

5000|$|Bologna Guglielmo Marconi Airport (BLQ): In June 2016, {{became the}} first Italian airport to equip ICT beacons {{throughout}} all terminals. It outfitted the <b>airport</b> with <b>beacons</b> that leverage both NFC tags and QR codes to provide hyper-contextualized mobile services to the 19,000 travelers who pass through every day.|$|R
5000|$|Area {{navigation}} (RNAV) is {{a method}} of instrument flight rules (IFR) navigation that allows an aircraft to choose any course within a network of navigation beacons, rather than navigate directly {{to and from the}} beacons. This can conserve flight distance, reduce congestion, and allow flights into <b>airports</b> without <b>beacons.</b> Area navigation used to be called [...] "random navigation", hence the acronym RNAV.|$|R
50|$|Beacons {{can also}} be {{combined}} with semaphoric or other indicators to provide important information, such as the status of an airport, by the colour and rotational pattern of its <b>airport</b> <b>beacon,</b> or of pending weather as indicated on a weather beacon mounted {{at the top of}} a tall building or similar site. When used in such fashion, beacons can be considered a form of optical telegraphy.|$|E
50|$|On 27 January 2005, a Farnair Hungary Let L-410 {{aircraft}} was {{carrying out a}} non-directional beacon let-down with radar assistance at Ia»ôi Airport, Romania, but when the crew notified air traffic control of their position over the <b>airport</b> <b>beacon</b> and their intention to turn right outbound, they were seen to turn left. Then the aircraft spiralled down to crash on the airfield. The two crew members on board were killed. There was light snow at the time.|$|E
5000|$|... "RYV," [...] {{as it was}} known, had a market, {{hardware}} store, {{milk and}} diaper delivery, drug store, theater and other amenities commonly found in small towns, and children enjoyed the adjacent Griffith Park and climbing the tower which still held the <b>airport</b> <b>beacon.</b> The Helms Bakery trucks and Fuller Brush salesmen made the rounds, {{as they did in}} the other neighborhoods in the area. Residents planted lawns and gardens, and were encouraged to make their surroundings as homelike as possible.|$|E
50|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} the Coast Guard decided {{to remove the}} Fresnel lens and test a DCB <b>airport</b> style <b>beacon.</b> The beacon only lasted a few years until it was {{replaced}} by a much smaller AGA-acrylic revolving beacon that provided the same range as the DCB, but with a 150-watt bulb instead of the 1,000-watt DCB bulb. In 1998, the Coast Guard replaced the AGA with a newer Vega rotating beacon.|$|R
50|$|On March 11, 1936, W.L. Smith, a {{pilot for}} TWA, was {{descending}} {{to land at}} Pittsburgh's Allegheny County Airport but found the <b>airport's</b> radio <b>beacon</b> had led him 40 mi off course. After landing safely, Smith complained to airport officials, who were unable to find anything wrong with the beacon. Other pilots later testified the beacon frequently gave a false signal {{similar to the one}} received when an airplane was directly above the airport.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Airports</b> used green <b>beacons</b> and airways used red beacons. The beacons flashed {{identification}} numbers in Morse code. The sequence was [...] "WUVHRKDBGM" [...] prompting the training phrase [...] "When Undertaking Very Hard Routes Keep Directions By Good Methods." [...] {{to remember the}} sequence.|$|R
50|$|An old <b>airport</b> <b>beacon,</b> {{now out of}} service, is on {{the highest}} point of the {{mountain}} and can be climbed for better views of the surrounding terrain. It has been vandalized by many people writing their names and the dates they reached the summit. Some of the dates are as old as 1954. Evidence of power to the beacon is still present in the surrounding area. Old electrical wire is strewn about in various places, and rusted conduit is still present, along with boxes that contained breakers.|$|E
5000|$|In 1967 {{the lantern}} and lens {{were removed from}} the tower, which was {{suspected}} of being inadequate to support their weight. They were replaced by an aluminum lantern containing a rotating <b>airport</b> <b>beacon.</b> The reassembled Fresnel lens is now housed in the Grand Manan Museum in Grand Harbour. There it is the centrepiece of the Walter B. McLaughlin Marine Gallery, whose name honours Gannet Rock's longest serving (1853-1880) head lighthouse keeper. A cable attached to a Canadian Coast Guard vessel was used to detach the massive iron lantern {{from the top of the}} tower.|$|E
50|$|Wind Point Lighthouse was {{designed}} by Orlando Metcalfe Poe and constructed in 1880. The beacon was originally powered by a three-wicked kerosene lamp, magnified by a third-order Fresnel lens. The light was electrified in 1924, and replaced a DCB-24R <b>airport</b> <b>beacon</b> in 1964. The DCB-24R failed in 2007, {{and was replaced by}} a VRB-25 lens. A signal house (horns removed, resonators still in place) remains on the grounds as well as a garage, two storage buildings, and an oil house. The Village of Wind Point has maintained the lighthouse and grounds since 1964, and uses the old keepers' quarters as a village hall and police headquarters.|$|E
50|$|The DME/N or DME/P is an {{integral}} part of the MLS and is installed at all MLS facilities unless a waiver is obtained. This occurs infrequently and only at outlying, low density <b>airports</b> where marker <b>beacons</b> or compass locators are already in place.|$|R
50|$|Initially Dillant-Hopkins {{provided}} {{air service}} of two flights {{a day before}} being forced to fly a single flight a day. From January to May 1948 all air service from the airport was suspended. When regular air service resumed in May an air freight service was added. Lights for the runways {{were put in place}} in 1948 to 1949, and two years later the <b>airport's</b> signal <b>beacons</b> were added. By 1952 several industries were maintaining private airplanes for business purposes, and it was estimated that 200 planes a month were serviced by the airport.|$|R
40|$|New {{aeronautical}} ground lighting {{techniques are}} becoming increasingly important {{to ensure the safety}} and reduce the maintenance costs of the plane's tracks. Until recently, tracks had embedded lighting systems whose sources were based on incandescent lamps. But incandescent lamps have several disadvantages: high energy consumption and frequent breakdowns that result in high maintenance costs (lamp average life-time is similar to 1500 operating hours) and the lamp's technology has a lack of new lighting functions, such as signal handling and modification. To solve these problems, the industry has developed systems based on light-emitting diode (LED) technology with improved features: (1) LED lighting consumes one tenth the power, (2) it improves preventive maintenance (an LED's lifetime range is between 25, 000 and 100, 000 hours), and (3) LED lighting technology can be controlled remotely according {{to the needs of the}} track configuration. LEDs have been in use for more than three decades, but only recently, around 2002, have they begun to be used as visual aids, representing the greatest potential change for airport lighting since their inception in the 1920 s. Currently, embedded LED systems are not being broadly used due to the specific constraints of the rules and regulations of <b>airports</b> (<b>beacon</b> dimensions, power system technology, etc.). The fundamental requirements applied to embedded lighting systems are to be hosted on a volume where the dimensions are usually critical and also to integrate all the essential components for operation. An embedded architecture that meets the lighting regulations for airport runways is presented. The present work is divided into three main tasks: development of an optical system to optimize lighting according to International Civil Aviation Organization, manufacturing prototype, and model validation...|$|R

50|$|In 1970 an {{electronic}} horn was installed, {{eliminating the need}} for engines and compressors used with the diaphone horn-and the third keeper. His dwelling, now surplus, was sold and removed from the station in August 1977. Further downgraded to a one-person station in January 1979, the older two-storey dwelling was first converted to a survival station, then sold and removed in 1987. In the meantime, the third-order Fresnel lens was replaced in October 1984 by a DCB-36 optic, a 91.44 cm diameter rotating <b>airport</b> <b>beacon.</b> The Fresnel lens is reported to be in storage at the Coast Guard base in Dartmouth. The round, iron, first-order lantern remains atop the lighthouse tower, the last classic lantern of this type still in use on an operational lighthouse in Nova Scotia.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Airport</b> and {{heliport}} <b>beacons</b> {{are designed}} {{in such a}} way to make them most effective from one to ten degrees above the horizon; however, they can be seen well above and below this peak spread. The beacon may be an [...] flashing xenon strobe, or it may be an aerobeacon rotating at a constant speed which produces the visual effect of flashes at regular intervals. Flashes may be of just a single color, or of two alternating colors.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Air Traffic Control {{system of}} a country manages all the aircrafts that fly in its airspace, designs control sectors, manages the flows between the {{different}} <b>airports</b> and <b>beacons,</b> ensures separation between aircraft during their flight, take off and landing. Thus, it operates at different levels, {{each one of them}} designed to provide control, ensure safety, and limit the traffic passed to the following level. In this paper, we show how Genetic Algorithms can improve some of the tasks manually done by the ATC system. After a brief description of GAs, some of the improvements used (simulated annealing, sharing), we study three applications of GAs to ATC. We first show an application of GAs to en-route conflict resolution. Then we give an example on GAs used to optimize air space sectoring. The last part gives an application of GAs to traffic assignment...|$|R
5000|$|A beacon {{named for}} the aviator Charles Lindbergh {{was added to the}} {{building}} in 1930. It rotated a full 360 degrees and was intended to help guide airplanes safely to Midway <b>Airport.</b> [...] The <b>beacon</b> beamed for several decades, and ceased operation in 1981 following complaints from residents of nearby buildings. During the Palmolive Building's conversion to condominiums in the late 2000s, the beacon was modified to rotate back and forth, always pointing at the lake, so as to avoid shining light into other buildings. Subsequently, the historic beacon resumed operation.|$|R
