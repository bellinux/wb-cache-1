The Q parameter of the Langmuir isotherm resulted as the most suitable for providing direct evidence of the contribution of calcareous component in P sorption experiments carried out after removal of this component from soil. A phosphate sorption study on calcite, under varying ionic strength and dielectric constant of the P solutions, established that about 13 % of the adsorption was caused by electrostatic attraction.

40|$|Water {{hardness}} {{is due to}} {{the presence}} of multivalent metal ions. In natural waters, the most abundant ions are calcium(II) and, in less amount, magnesium(II). Cations such as Fe(III), Al(III), Mn(II) and other metal ions also contribute to hardness, although their concentration level is much below the concentration level of calcium. Water hardness is a parameter of interest in water analysis, since it has adverse consequences in a great deal of human activities related to the use of this natural resource. The most widely employed assay for water hardness is complexometry. When hardness in water is determined by complexometry, the obtained value accounts for all multivalent metal ions present in the sample. Very often, the result is given as <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> <b>equivalent</b> per liter. In this simulated lab experiment, the complexometric titration of hardness in a water sample is carried out.

40|$|ABSTRACT The Bambuí Group, {{formed from}} siliciclastic sediments {{deposited}} on an extensive epicontinental platform {{at the end}} of the Neoproterozoic era, is characterized by limestones with fine to very fine texture. Limestone-derived soils in the southeast of Tocantins state, Brazil, are less notorious than similar soils in other regions of Brazil and their characterization could contribute to the Brazilian System for Soil Classification (SiBCS). Given that little is known of these soils, despitetheir agricultural potential, the objective of this study was to characterize their properties and the processes leading to soil of genesis, and also contribute to developing the Brazilian System of Soil Classification (SiBCS). Soils profiles were located on the summit (P 1), shoulder (P 2), backslope (P 3), and footslope (P 4) of a toposequence in the municipality of Lavandeira, Tocantins. Morphological, physical, chemical, and mineralogical properties of the profiles were determined. The soils were classified as: P 1 - Chernossolo Rêndzico Lítico típico (Lithic Haplustolls); P 2 - Cambissolo Háplico Ta Eutrófico léptico hipocarbonático (Lithic Haplustolls); P 3 - Cambissolo Háplico Carbonático léptico (Lithic Haplustepts); and P 4 - Luvissolo Háplico Órtico típico (Typic Rhodustalfs). All the profiles showed high contents of silt, calcium, and magnesium, which resulted in high pH and low exchangeable aluminum content. Base saturation and <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> <b>equivalent</b> contents were also high, and the horizons showed dark colors due to high organic matter content, which contained humin as the dominant fraction. Mineralogical analysis of the clay fraction indicated predominance of hydroxy-interlayered vermiculite, followed by illite, kaolinite, and quartz, whereas the sand fraction exhibited reflections characteristic of the quartz mineral.

For this purpose, six sites were chosen throughout two types of softwood forests (willow and alder forest) representing two stages of vegetation succession. Evidence of soil texture influence on aggregate stability was observed. A dominance of a coarse sand fraction caused a quick colonization of enchytraeids and epigeic earthworms while a silty texture favoured the presence of anecic earthworms, thus increasing the aggregate stabilisation. Iron forms, acting as cementing agents, were observed in the coarse silt, while <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonates</b> were equally distributed among the textural fractions. <b>Active</b> <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> fraction, binding organic matter with mineral components, was not found in the coarse sand fraction.

40|$|Introduction Saffron {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{economically}} important plants across Iran and all over the world. The most important cultivated areas of saffron are in Khorasan-e Razavi and Southern Khorasan provinces (Jihad Keshavarzi Khorasan Razavi, 2013). The corm is the reservoir of photosynthetic materials and plays an important role in the saffron life cycle. Corm size and physicochemical characteristics of soil determine the growth and yield of saffron (Aytekin et al., 2008). It has been advised to use corms with diameter more than 2. 5 cm (Kafi et al., 2002). Despite the importance of this plant, few studies have been conducted on the effects of soil characteristics on the growth of the plant in natural field conditions. Therefore, the objective which we will try to achieve is: to evaluate the effect of soil physical and chemical characteristics of the growth of saffron corm and determine the most important effect characteristics. Materials and methods In September 2012, 30 samples of 3 to 5 years old saffron corms were taken from the fields with similar management in Torbat Heydariyeh. The surrounding soil corms (depth of 0 to 30 cm) were sampled, too. Dry weight of corms was measured in the laboratory. Air dried soil samples were passed through a 2 mm sieve and used for physical-chemical analyses. Soil texture was determined by using pipet method. Total nitrogen, available phosphorous, available potassium, soil organic carbon and <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> <b>equivalent</b> were measured in bulk soil samples. Calcium, magnesium, sodium, EC and pH were measured in the saturated soil paste. Fe, Cu and Zn were extracted by DTPA and measured by atomic adsorption spectroscopy. Correlation, regression and neural network technique were used to analyze the data and to identify the most important soil characteristics on the corms characteristics. Results and discussion Diameter and dry weight of corms with mean values of 34. 04 mm and 3. 72 g, ranged from 22. 8 to 51. 7 mm and 1. 5 to 6. 98 g, respectively.

30|$|Hardness {{is defined}} as a {{characteristic}} of water which represents the total concentration of Ca and Mg expressed as their <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> <b>equivalent.</b> Water hardness may be caused by natural geological process or pollution from industries and commercial operations. The ratio of Ca 2 + to Mg 2 + in Lusui bore-hole was about 2 (Table  2). This is an interesting result which may suggest that most of the calcium in Lusui waters may be due to maize and tea farming in the upper areas of Lusui (Nandi County). Another remarkable result was observed in Shivikwa borehole, where Mg was twice the concentration of Ca. Although it is expected that Ca should dominate the water because of application of calcium-based fertilizers such as calcium ammonium nitrate and lime in sugar farms, this was not so in Shivikwa waters (sample 7). Large concentrations of Mg may, therefore, be attributed to a geological source containing soil minerals rich in magnesium. Generally, apart from Lusui bore-hole which had the highest concentration of Ca (50.6  ±  1.5  mg/L), all other boreholes contained low concentrations of calcium in comparison to Mg levels. Ideally, Kakamega waters have significantly high concentrations of Mg.|$|R

Soil texture was measured by the hydrometer methods (11), Also EC and pH (39), <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> <b>equivalent</b> (37) and the saturation percentage of soils were determined. Kriging, Co-Kriging, Inverse Distance Weighting and Local Polynomial Interpolation techniques were evaluated to produce a soil characteristics map of the study area zoning and to select the best geostatistical methods. Cross-validation techniques and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were used. Results and Discussion: Normalized test results showed that all of the soil properties except <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> and soil clay content had normal distribution. In addition, the results of correlation test showed that the soil saturation percentage was positively correlated with silt content (r= 0. 43 and...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In Iran, the {{experimental}} plots under fertilizer trials are managed {{in such a}} way that the whole plot area uniformly receives agricultural inputs. This could lead to biased research results and hence to suppressing of the efforts made by the researchers. This research was conducted in a selected site belonging to the Gonbad Agricultural Research Station, located in the semiarid region, northeastern Iran. The aim was to characterize the short-range spatial variability of the inherent and management-depended soil properties and to determine if this variation is large and can be managed at practical scales. The soils were sampled using a grid 5  5 m apart. In total, 100 composite soil samples were collected from topsoil (0 - 30 cm) and were analyzed for <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> <b>equivalent,</b> organic carbon, clay, available phosphorus, available potassium, iron, copper, zinc and manganese. Descriptive statistics were applied to check data trends. Geostatistical analysis was applied to variography, model fitting and contour mapping. Sampling at 5  5 m made it possible to split the area of the selected experimental plot into relatively uniform areas that allow application of agricultural inputs with variable rates.

40|$|Iron {{deficiency}} chlorosis (IDC) and soybean {{cyst nematode}} (SCN; Heterodera glycines) infestation are major {{factors that contribute to}} soybean (Glycine max Merr.) yield reduction in the Midwest. The IDC is often associated with soybean grown on high pH, calcareous soils. In addition, it was documented that SCN population density is higher in high pH soils. The objectives of this paper were to assess the proportion of within-field soybean yield and SCN variability that could be explained by soil pH, <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> <b>equivalent</b> (CCE), and a previously defined alkalinity stress index (ASI). Aerial images from 21 fields planted to SCN-resistant or susceptible soybean varieties were collected from 2001 through 2005 and used as a guide for soil and grain sampling. Ten to 16 sampling sites were selected on each field. Regression analyses within and across sites were used to study relationships between the measured variables. The SCN population density increased and yield decreased with increasing pH, CCE, and ASI across the fields. The percentage of yield variability across fields explained by soil pH, CCE, ASI, and SCN was 13 %, 15 %, 18 %, and 1 %, respectively, for resistant soybean varieties and 37 %, 24 %, 39 %, and 10 %, respectively, for susceptible varieties. The yield reduction due to high pH, CCE, and ASI was greater for SCN-susceptible varieties in field areas heavily infested with SCN...|$|R
40|$|Information about {{forms of}} zinc (Zn) is {{important}} for the evaluation of its status in soil and also understanding of the soil fertility and chemistry. To obtain such information, amounts and distribution of Zn in different fractions of 20 soil samples of Tehran province, Iran were determined by sequential extraction method and their relationships {{with each other and with}} soil characteristics were investigated. Total Zn of soils ranged from 70 to 169. 9 mg/kg- 1. The amount of different Zn forms relative to the sum of forms was determined to be as follows: organic less than 0. 1, soluble+exchangeable 0. 1, manganese-oxide-associated 0. 9, carbonate 1. 6, crystalline iron-oxide-associated 3. 8, amorphous iron-oxide-associated 4. 2, and residual form 89. 3 %. Simple correlation coefficients showed that pH had a negative significant correlation with all forms of Zn except organic. Silt and clay contents had significant positive correlations with total, residual, and crystalline iron-oxide-asociated Zn but CEC had significant correlation only with total Zn. <b>Calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> <b>equivalent</b> showed a significant correlation with soluble+exchangeable, manganese-oxide-associated and amorphous iron-oxide-associated Zn. DTPA-extractable Zn was significantly correlated with soluble+exchangeable, carbonate, and amorphous iron-oxide-associated Zn. A significant correlation was also observed between the Zn forms themselves, which is presumably a reflection of the existence of a dynamic relation between the chemical forms of an element in soil...|$|R
40|$|Aluminium {{toxicity}} {{has been}} {{recognized as one of}} the most common causes of reduced grape yields in vineyard acid soils. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of two liming materials, i. e. dolomitic lime and sugar foam, on a vineyard cultivated in an acid soil. The effects were studied in two soil layers (0 - 30 and 30 - 60 cm), as well as on leaf nutrient contents, must quality properties and grape yield, in an agricultural soil dedicated to Vitis vinifera L. cv. ‘Mencía’ cultivation. Data management and analysis were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). As liming material, sugar foam was more efficient than dolomitic limestone because sugar foam promoted the highest decrease in soil acidity properties at the same <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> <b>equivalent</b> dose. However, potassium contents in vines organs, including leaves and berries, seemed to decrease as a consequence of liming, with a concomitant increase in must total acidity. Soil available phosphorus also decreased as a consequence of liming, especially with sugar foam, though no effects were observed in plants. For these reasons fertilization of this soil with K and P is recommended along with liming. Grape yields in limed soils increased, although non-significantly, by 30 %. This research has therefore provided an important opportunity to advance in our understanding of the effects of liming on grape quality and production in acid soils...|$|R
