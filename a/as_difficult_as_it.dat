5|$|The high-{{definition}} upgrade was not <b>as</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> {{might have}} been as all the art assets had been created in high definition and reduced for the PS2 hardware. Other aspects for the visuals, such as character faces, needed to be redrawn by Kamitani as they remained in low definition. There were also graphic elements remade as the team considered them to be rather poor quality when compared to their current work. Added shadow effects were created, but special parameters needed {{to be set as}} there were no 3D environments to use as reference. The 2D perspective also meant that the way enemies behaved needed to be adjusted, so they would not attack the player character while still off screen. In general, the overall graphical quality was improved, the resolution was increased, and the aspect ratio was changed from the original 4:3 to 16:9. The shift to 16:9 meant that character models needed to be re-positioned so as not to leave blank spaces {{on either side of the}} central scene. As they needed to analyse the original software to make such changes but had lost the original software used to create the cutscenes, they needed to hurriedly create alternate editing software that ran on a PC. In addition to changes to scenery and model positioning, the text font was resized to match the larger screen and the text bubbles were smoothed out.|$|E

60|$|It {{would be}} {{difficult}} to guess at the time we spent wandering through those black corridors, climbing steep ascents, feeling our way along the edges of bottomless pits, never knowing at what moment we might be plunged into some abyss and always haunted by the ever-present terror of death by starvation and thirst. <b>As</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was, I still realized that it might have been infinitely worse had I had another companion than Ajor--courageous, uncomplaining, loyal little Ajor! She was tired and hungry and thirsty, and she must have been discouraged; but she never faltered in her cheerfulness. I asked her if she was afraid, and she replied that here the Wieroo could not get her, and that if she died of hunger, she would at least die with me and she was quite content that such should be her end. At the time I attributed her attitude to something akin to a doglike devotion to a new master who had been kind to her. I can take oath to the fact that I did not think it was anything more.|$|E

But the proportion held about the same, although I consider that fishing for a sailfish and catching one is a great gain in point. Still, we {{do not know}} much about sailfish or how to take them. If I got twenty strikes and caught only four fish, very likely the smallest that bit, I most assuredly was not doing skilful fishing as compared with other kinds of fishing. And there is the rub. Sailfish are not any other kind of fish. They have a wary and cunning habit, with an exceptional occasion of blind hunger, and they have small, bony jaws into which it is hard to sink a hook. Not one of my sailfish was hooked deep down. Yet I let nearly all of them run out a long line. Moreover, as I said before, if a sailfish is hooked there are ten chances to one that he will free himself.|$|E

30|$|To {{implement}} the required degree of tenant isolation on a GSD tool, {{some level of}} customization {{would have to be}} done depending on the level where the process or component to be customised resides [47].

6000|$|A certain bewilderment, for our hero, {{disengaged}} {{itself from}} these remarks: they {{struck him as}} a contradiction, a retractation, strange {{on the part of}} a man who hadn't the excuse of witlessness. He had certainly not expected his correspondent to rejoice in the death of his wife, and it was perfectly in order that the rupture of a tie of more than twenty years should have left him sore. But if she had been so clear a blessing what in the name of consistency had the dear man meant by turning him upside down that night--by dosing him to that degree, at the most sensitive hour of his life, with the doctrine of renunciation? If Mrs. St. George was an irreparable loss, then her husband's inspired advice had been a bad joke and renunciation was a mistake. Overt was on the point of rushing back to London to show that, for his part, he was perfectly willing to consider it so, and he went so far as to take the manuscript of the first chapters of his new book out of his table-drawer, to insert it into a pocket of his portmanteau. This led to his catching a glimpse of certain pages he hadn't looked at for months, and that accident, in turn, to his being struck with the high promise they revealed--a rare result of such retrospections, which it was his habit to avoid as much as possible: they usually brought home to him that the glow of composition might be a purely subjective and misleading emotion. On this occasion a certain belief in himself disengaged itself whimsically from the serried erasures of his first draft, making him think it best after all to pursue his present trial to the end. If he could write as well under the rigour of privation it might be a mistake to change the conditions before that spell had spent itself. He would go back to London of course, but he would go back only when he should have finished his book. This was the vow he privately made, restoring his manuscript to the table-drawer. It may be added that it took him a long time to finish his book, for the subject was <b>as</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was fine, and he was literally embarrassed by the fulness of his notes. Something within him warned him that he must make it supremely good--otherwise he should lack, as regards his private behaviour, a handsome excuse. He had a horror of this deficiency and found himself as firm as need be on the question of the lamp and the file. He crossed the Alps at last and spent the winter, the spring, the ensuing summer, in Italy, where still, at the end of a twelvemonth, his task was unachieved. [...] "Stick to it--see it through": this general injunction of St. George's was good also for the particular case. He applied it to the utmost, with the result that when in its slow order the summer had come round again he felt he had given all that was in him. This time he put his papers into his portmanteau, with the address of his publisher attached, and took his way northward.|$|E

In short conventional method of egg hatching requires continuous supply of power. In this paper a new method of solar poultry incubator design is suggested {{which could be used}} to hatch eggs from solar pv and hence could reduce the usage of power and can maximize the usage of solar power which is a renewable source of energy. By implementing this method of solar poultry incubator {{we will be able to}} reduce the power consumption of the incubator by 75 % and the cost involved in the design also yields profit and hence could bring out a revolution in this field...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a set of {{paradoxical}} questions: how French students of linguistics are able to fathom their own command of French spelling rules and their metalinguistic ability in analyzing their own mistakes produced when writing graduate examination tests? How linguists teaching these students can handle discrepancies between the linguistic performance they might expect from students and actual results they get from an inquiry on students' habits in writing French? How methods initially contrived for the analysis of speech variation, such as co-variationism (the labovian paradigm.) could be applied to written forms of language in order to observe linguistic change in other fields than spoken usage? A survey of students' usage of written French, and attitudes towards written norm carried out at the University of Montpellier shows that students tend to have a fuzzy knowledge of their own command of written French and of French spelling rules, but still cling to a conservative approach to French orthography, rejecting claims for reform (réforme de l'orthographe). We also address the question of what kind of linguistic change is implied in spelling mistakes, as many trends for structural change can be observed through this kind of corpora, which nevertheless have few chances to trigger real changes in the written norm of French, because of wide-spread support to maintain French spelling <b>as</b> much <b>difficult</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is, regardless of how it could be made more easy and functionnal...|$|R
