5|$|After Genghis Khan's {{death in}} 1227, his empire was divided by his {{descendants}} into four sections or Khanates, which degenerated into civil war. The northwestern Kipchak Khanate, {{known as the}} Golden Horde, expanded towards Europe, primarily via Hungary and Poland, while its leaders simultaneously opposed the rule of their cousins back at the Mongol capital. The southwestern section, known as the Ilkhanate, was {{under the leadership of}} Genghis Khan's grandson Hulagu. He continued to support his brother, the Great Khan, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> at war with the Golden Horde, {{while at the same time}} continuing an advance towards Persia and the Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|After {{considerable}} construction {{effort in}} the face of wet weather, the airbase was completed and proved useful. Whereas the base at Nadzab was surrounded by mountains <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> unsuited for missions that had to take off after dark, there was no such problem at Saidor. During March 1944, B-24 Liberator bombers staged through Saidor for night attacks on Hollandia.|$|E

50|$|Italian is a Romance language, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> a {{descendant}} of Vulgar Latin (the spoken form of non-classical Latin). Standard Italian is based on Tuscan, especially its Florentine dialect, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> an Italo-Dalmatian language, to which Sicilian and the extinct Dalmatian also belong, among a few others.|$|R
5|$|Almost {{all modern}} paleontologists agreed with Riggs {{that the two}} dinosaurs should be {{classified}} together in a single genus. According {{to the rules of}} the ICZN (which governs the scientific names of animals), the name Apatosaurus, having been published first, has priority as the official name; Brontosaurus was considered a junior synonym <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> long discarded from formal use. Despite this, at least one paleontologistRobert T. Bakkerargued in the 1990s that A.ajax and A.excelsus were in fact sufficiently distinct for the latter to merit a separate genus.|$|E
5|$|Blücher {{spent most}} of November 1939 fitting out and {{finishing}} additional improvements. By {{the end of the}} month, the ship was ready for sea trials; she steamed to Gotenhafen in the Baltic Sea. The trials lasted until mid-December, after which the ship returned to Kiel for final modifications. In January 1940, she resumed her exercises in the Baltic, but {{by the middle of the}} month, severe ice forced the ship to remain in port. On 5 April, she was deemed to be ready for action, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> assigned to the forces participating in the invasion of Norway.|$|E
5|$|Carine Ngarlemdana {{made her}} Olympic debut at the 2012 games. At {{the time she}} was 17 years of age. She was the flag bearer at both the opening and closing ceremonies. She was the third Chadian in Olympic history to compete in a judo event. Ngarlemdana {{qualified}} for the 70 kilogram event as an African Judo Union qualifier. On 1 August Ngarlemdana competed {{in the first round of}} her event. She was drawn against Sally Conway (Great Britain). Ngarlemdana lost 0002—1110 <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> eliminated from the competition. Overall she finished joint 17th and, along with five other athletes, last in the competition.|$|E
30|$|The {{identified}} {{structural changes}} have important policy implications. Cyclical problems {{in an economy}} are usually caused {{by a lack of}} labor demand <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> transitory, but a rise in structural unemployment is typically caused by a mismatch in the labor market and/or job separation <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> often persistent.|$|R

5|$|Coffelt's {{account was}} {{reviewed}} by the FBI, which concluded that it differed in significant details from information {{that had not been}} made public, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> a fabrication. Brown, undeterred, continued peddling the story long after Coffelt died in 1975. Multiple media venues, including the television news program 60 Minutes, considered and rejected it. In a 2008 book about Lincoln's descendants, author Charles Lachman revisited Coffelt's tale although it had been discredited 36 years before.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being an}} {{artillery}} tower {{with a flat}} roof to carry heavy guns, the tower was not initially supplied with any artillery <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> unable to protect Rye against the hostile naval expeditions which attacked the coast in the 1520s. After many letters to from Guldeford to the Lord Chancellor, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, some guns finally arrived around 1536 {{in the form of}} wrought iron serpentines. Prescient concerns began to be raised in the mid-1530s about whether the Camber might silt up further and ultimately become unusable as an anchorage.|$|E
5|$|Despite these advances, {{movable type}} {{printing}} never gained {{the amount of}} widespread use in East Asia that woodblock printing had achieved since the Chinese Tang Dynasty in the 9th century. With written Chinese, the vast amount of written morpheme characters impeded movable type's acceptance and practical use, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> seen as largely unsatisfactory. Furthermore, the European printing press, first invented by Johannes Gutenberg (1398–1468), was eventually wholly adopted as the standard in China, yet the tradition of woodblock printing remains popular in East Asian countries still.|$|E

5|$|Early {{experiments}} with radiolabelled systemin in tomato demonstrated {{that it is}} transported through the phloem sap in tomato plants <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> {{thought to be the}} systemic signal that activated systemic acquired resistance. This view was challenged by grafting experiments which showed that mutants deficient in jasmonic acid biosynthesis and perception were unable to activate systemic acquired resistance. It is now thought that jasmonic acid is the systemic signal and that systemin upregulates the pathways for jasmonic acid synthesis.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the ACC {{experienced}} {{a season of}} unusual parity and fielded an NCAA-record number of ten bowl-eligible teams. Six of those possessed identical 4–4 conference records, and the remaining four had 5–3 conference records. Among the eligible teams, N.C. State (6–6) possessed the only non-winning overall record <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> forced by NCAA rules to find an at-large berth outside of the ACC tie-in games.|$|E
5|$|In late 1805, First Lord of the Admiralty Lord Barham {{withdrew the}} Royal Navy {{blockade}} of the French Atlantic ports following the Trafalgar Campaign, {{in which the}} French Navy had lost 14 ships of the line. Barham believed that the French, having suffered such heavy losses, would be unable and unwilling to launch a major offensive in the Atlantic until after the winter. However, he had miscalculated {{the strength of the}} fleet at Brest, the principal French Atlantic seaport. The Brest fleet had not been engaged in the 1805 campaign <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> intact.|$|E

5|$|It is {{believed}} that the Lānai hookbill inhabited montane dry forests on Lānai dominated by akoko (Euphorbia species) and ōpuhe (Urera glabra). The unique shape of the hookbill's bill, particularly {{when compared with the}} ōū's bill, and its apparent rarity suggested that the species was an extreme specialist <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> restricted to this habitat.|$|E

5|$|Now, {{the match}} is {{recognised}} as the initial first-class match {{to be played}} in Australia. At the time, {{it is likely that}} the players realised that the game was the first to take place between two Australian colonies, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> a historic occasion. Although there were attempts in Australia to identify first-class matches, no formal definition was applied in Australia until 1947. A meeting of the International Cricket Conference in 1981 agreed that all intercolonial and interstate matches played in Australia before 1947, including the 1851 match, should retrospectively be considered first-class.|$|E

5|$|The final {{fight of}} Johnson's early period, {{during which the}} stake money was {{relatively}} low, was his comprehensive win over a ponderous fighter called Fry for a prize of 50guineas at Kingston. The fight, which lasted less than 30minutes, ended with Fry badly beaten up and Johnson with barely a scratch on him. This fight did not attract many supporters of the sport; it took place on 6June 1786 <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> during the period when the wealthy were away from London.|$|E
