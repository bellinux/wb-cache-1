25|$|Those defeats {{seemed to}} mark {{a turning point}} in Sakuraba's career; though he was unbeaten in his first nine Pride bouts, he {{thereafter}} split his next six matches. He had a notable victory over Kevin Randleman, a former UFC Heavyweight Champion, widely remembered due to his ring entrance as Mario, a pun intended to reflect the Japanese media referring to Randleman as Donkey Kong. In the match itself, Randleman was fast in showing his wrestling accolades at taking down Sakuraba, but the Japanese countered by setting submissions from every <b>available</b> <b>position,</b> until the American made a mistake and was caught in an armbar in the third round.|$|E
500|$|In 1914, the {{explorer}} Ernest Shackleton began preparing an expedition {{which had the}} goal of completing the first crossing of the Antarctic continent. The failure of Robert Falcon Scott to beat the Norwegian Roald Amundsen to the South Pole in 1911 was considered a blot on Britain's reputation in polar exploration. Shackleton's expedition was intended to return {{the country to the}} forefront of Antarctic endeavour. He set up his headquarters at Burlington Road in London, and was interviewing candidates for the expedition. [...] One <b>available</b> <b>position</b> was that of captain for the expedition's vessel, the Endurance.|$|E
500|$|Napoleon's Grande Armée {{made its}} final {{approach}} to Moscow from the WSW along the Smolensk Roads with the Moscow River on its left flank. A defensive line {{was established in}} the best <b>available</b> <b>position</b> along this path before Moscow near the village of Borodino. Although the Borodino field was too open and had too few natural obstacles to protect the Russian center and the left flank, it was chosen due to the protection provided by the Kolocha river, because it blocked both Smolensk–Moscow roads and because there were simply no better locations. Starting on 3 September, Kutuzov strengthened the line with earthworks, including the Raevski Redoubt in the center-right of the line and three open, arrow-shaped [...] "Bagration flèches" [...] (named after Pyotr Bagration) on the left.|$|E

2500|$|Production F4U-1s {{featured}} {{several major}} modifications {{compared with the}} XF4U-1. A change of armament to six wing-mounted [...]50in (12.7mm) M2 Browning machine guns (three in each outer wing panel) and their ammunition (400 rounds for the inner pair, 375 rounds for the outer) meant that {{the location of the}} wing fuel tanks had to be changed. In order to keep the fuel tank close to the center of gravity, the only <b>available</b> <b>position</b> was in the forward fuselage, ahead of the cockpit. Accordingly, as a 237gal (897l) self-sealing fuel tank replaced the fuselage mounted armament, the cockpit had to be moved back by [...] and the fuselage lengthened. In addition, 150lb of armor plate was installed, along with a [...] bullet-proof windscreen which was set internally, behind the curved Plexiglas windscreen. The canopy could be jettisoned in an emergency, and half-elliptical planform transparent panels, much like those of certain models of the Curtiss P-40, were inset into the sides of the fuselage's turtledeck structure behind the pilot's headrest, providing the pilot with a limited rear view over his shoulders. A rectangular Plexiglas panel was inset into the lower center section to allow the pilot to see directly beneath the aircraft and assist with deck landings. The engine used was the more powerful R-2800-8 (B series) Double Wasp which produced 2,000hp (1,491kW). On the wings the flaps were changed to a NACA slotted type and the ailerons were increased in span to increase the roll rate, with a consequent reduction in flap span. IFF transponder equipment was fitted in the rear fuselage. These changes increased the Corsair's weight by several hundred pounds.|$|E

40|$|The pool of US {{applicants}} to family medicine residency programs {{has been in}} decline since 1997.

Additionally, only 1, 132 (40. 7 %) of <b>available</b> <b>positions</b> were filled with US medical school seniors in 2005, compared with 71. 7 % in 1997. 1 This decline has placed pressure on residency programs to effectively recruit US applicants, fill <b>available</b> <b>positions</b> with for-eign medical school graduates, or face downsizing or closure. Indeed, resulting competition over the shrink-ing pool of interested US students has created a “buyer’s market ” for applicants, forcing residency programs to create unique educational opportunities that help to separate their program from the next...|$|R

6000|$|Two {{days before}} Maggie {{received}} that letter, {{she had been}} to the Rectory for the last time. The heavy rain would have prevented her from going since; but there was another reason. Dr. Kenn, at first enlightened only by a few hints as to the new turn which gossip and slander had taken in relation to Maggie, had recently been made more fully aware of it by an earnest remonstrance from one of his male parishioners against the indiscretion of persisting in the attempt to overcome the prevalent feeling in the parish by a course of resistance. Dr. Kenn, having a conscience void of offence in the matter, was still inclined to persevere,--was still averse to give way before a public sentiment that was odious and contemptible; but he was finally wrought upon by the consideration of the peculiar responsibility attached to his office, of avoiding the appearance of evil,--an [...] "appearance" [...] that is always dependent on the average quality of surrounding minds. Where these minds are low and gross, the area of that [...] "appearance" [...] is proportionately widened. Perhaps he was in danger of acting from obstinacy; perhaps it was his duty to succumb. Conscientious people are apt to see their duty in that which is the most painful course; and to recede was always painful to Dr. Kenn. He made up his mind that he must advise Maggie to go away from St. Ogg's for a time; and he performed that difficult task with as much delicacy as he could, only stating in vague terms that he found his attempt to countenance her stay was a source of discord between himself and his parishioners, that was likely to obstruct his usefulness as a clergyman. He begged her to allow him to write to a clerical friend of his, who might possibly take her into his own family as governess; and, if not, would probably know of some other <b>available</b> <b>position</b> for a young woman in whose welfare Dr. Kenn felt a strong interest.|$|E

50|$|Another {{interesting}} {{system is}} the cyclononatetraenyl cation explored for over 30 years by Paul v. R. Schleyer et al. This reactive intermediate is implied in the solvolysis of the bicyclic chloride 9-deutero-9'-chlorobicyclo6.1.0-nonatriene 1 to the indene dihydroindenol 4. The starting chloride is deuterated in only one position but in the final product deuterium is distributed at every <b>available</b> <b>position.</b> This observation is explained by invoking a twisted 8-electron cyclononatetraenyl cation 2 for which a NICS value of -13.4 (outsmarting benzene) is calculated.|$|E
