5|$|There {{are several}} <b>analogous</b> battles.|$|E
5|$|A viral genome, {{irrespective}} of nucleic acid type, {{is almost always}} either single-stranded or double-stranded. Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, <b>analogous</b> to one-half of a ladder split down the middle. Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, <b>analogous</b> to a ladder. The virus particles of some virus families, such as those belonging to the Hepadnaviridae, contain a genome that is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded.|$|E
5|$|British Pacific Fleet – An <b>analogous</b> {{situation}} in World War II where a British and Commonwealth force was amalgamated into the United States Pacific Fleet in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Cheating, where {{either a}} cleaner {{sometimes}} harms its client, or a predatory species mimics a cleaner, also occurs. Predatory cheating is <b>analogous</b> to Batesian mimicry, as where a harmless hoverfly mimics a stinging wasp, though with the tables turned. Some genuine cleaner fish, such as gobies and wrasse, {{have the same}} colours and patterns, in an example of convergent evolution. Mutual resemblance among cleaner fish is <b>analogous</b> to Mullerian mimicry, as where stinging bees and wasps mimic each other.|$|E
5|$|Completely <b>analogous</b> {{reactions}} {{occur for}} the niobium component, but the hexafluoride is typically predominant under {{the conditions of}} the extraction.|$|E
5|$|Cupuaçu {{butter is}} closely <b>analogous</b> to cocoa, {{and is used}} to make white chocolate.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Abraham Waldman (Kevin Rock) – <b>Analogous</b> to M. Waldman, {{he serves}} as a mentor to Frankenstein.|$|E
5|$|Eli Lavenza (Brendan Bradley) – <b>Analogous</b> to Elizabeth Lavenza, {{he is one}} of Frankenstein's close friends.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{expression}} in prokaryotes {{is influenced by}} an RNA-based system similar in some respects to RNAi. Here, RNA-encoding genes control mRNA abundance or translation by producing a complementary RNA that anneals to an mRNA. However these regulatory RNAs are not {{generally considered to be}} <b>analogous</b> to miRNAs because the dicer enzyme is not involved. It has been suggested that CRISPR interference systems in prokaryotes are <b>analogous</b> to eukaryotic RNA interference systems, although none of the protein components are orthologous.|$|E
5|$|Gideon v. Wainwright. <b>Analogous</b> case in United States Constitutional law.|$|E
5|$|One stable N-heterocyclic carbene has a {{structure}} <b>analogous</b> to borazine with one boron atom {{replaced by a}} methylene group. This results in a planar 6-electron compound.|$|E
5|$|Rory Clerval (Sara Fletcher) – <b>Analogous</b> to Henry Clerval, she {{is another}} of Frankenstein's close friends.|$|E
5|$|The {{amorphous}} form {{of boron}} nitride (a-BN) is non-crystalline, lacking any long-distance regularity in {{the arrangement of}} its atoms. It is <b>analogous</b> to amorphous carbon.|$|E
5|$|This {{reaction}} is {{conducted in the}} oxidising solvent arsenic pentafluoride. The trichloride anion, , has also been characterised; it is <b>analogous</b> to triiodide.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the middle}} planets {{are located in the}} system's {{habitable}} zone; however, they are giant planets believed to be <b>analogous</b> to Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|William Stokoe {{proposed}} that these components are <b>analogous</b> to the phonemes of spoken languages. There {{has also been}} a proposal that these are <b>analogous</b> to classes like place and manner of articulation. As in spoken languages, these phonological units can be split into distinctive features. For instance, the handshapes /2/ and /3/ are distinguished by {{the presence or absence of}} the feature , as illustrated to the right. ASL has processes of allophony and phonotactic restrictions. There is ongoing research into whether ASL has an analog of syllables in spoken language.|$|E
5|$|Zr and Hf {{can also}} be {{separated}} by fractional crystallization of potassium hexafluorozirconate (K2ZrF6), which is less soluble in water than the <b>analogous</b> hafnium derivative.|$|E
5|$|A bourdon or knobbed {{staff is}} shown behind {{the arms of}} some priors and prioresses {{as a symbol of}} office <b>analogous</b> to the crosier. Arms of priors from the 15th century had a banner {{surrounding}} the shield, but today this is often a rosary.|$|E
5|$|After Neil Bartlett's {{discovery}} in 1962 that xenon can form chemical compounds, {{a large number}} of xenon compounds have been discovered and described. Almost all known xenon compounds contain the electronegative atoms fluorine or oxygen. The chemistry of xenon in each oxidation state is <b>analogous</b> to that of the neighboring element iodine in the immediately lower oxidation state.|$|E
5|$|Alkali metals form ionic {{and highly}} soluble monofluorides; these have the cubic {{arrangement}} of sodium chloride and <b>analogous</b> chlorides. Alkaline earth difluorides possess strong ionic bonds but are insoluble in water, {{with the exception}} of beryllium difluoride, which also exhibits some covalent character and has a quartz-like structure. Rare earth elements and many other metals form mostly ionic trifluorides.|$|E
5|$|Apple's App Store, which {{provides}} iPhone and iPad applications, imposes censorship of content, {{which has become}} an issue for book publishers and magazines seeking to use the platform. The Guardian newspaper described the role of Apple as <b>analogous</b> to that of British magazine distributor WH Smith, which for many years imposed content restrictions.|$|E
5|$|As {{feathers}} grow at variable rates, these variations lead to visible {{dark and}} light bands in the fully formed feather. These so-called growth bars and their widths {{have been used to}} determine the daily nutritional status of birds. Each light and dark bar correspond to around 24 hours and the use of this technique has been called ptilochronology (<b>analogous</b> to dendrochronology).|$|E
5|$|As {{with several}} <b>analogous</b> light {{military}} vehicles, despite being {{originally designed to}} fill a light reconnaissance role, the rise of urban warfare and close quarters combat meant that the Israel Defense Forces had to recast the Storm in new roles.|$|E
5|$|Based on an {{observed}} excess {{emission of}} infrared radiation, Vega {{appears to have}} a circumstellar disk of dust. This dust {{is likely to be the}} result of collisions between objects in an orbiting debris disk, which is <b>analogous</b> to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System. Stars which display an infrared excess due to dust emission are termed Vega-like stars.|$|E
5|$|Certain solids are {{selenium}}-rich, and selenium can be bioconcentrated by some plants. In soils, selenium {{most often}} occurs in soluble forms such as selenate (<b>analogous</b> to sulfate), which are leached into rivers very easily by runoff. Ocean water contains {{significant amounts of}} selenium.|$|E
5|$|Finally some sharks {{maintain}} a placental {{link to the}} developing young, this method is called viviparity. This is more <b>analogous</b> to mammalian gestation than that of other fishes. The young are born alive and fully functional. Hammerheads, the requiem sharks (such as the bull and blue sharks), and smoothhounds are viviparous.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen azide (HN3) {{was first}} {{produced}} in 1890 by the oxidation of aqueous hydrazine by nitrous acid. It is very explosive and even dilute solutions can be dangerous. It has a disagreeable and irritating smell {{and is a}} potentially lethal (but not cumulative) poison. It may be considered the conjugate acid of the azide anion, and is similarly <b>analogous</b> to the hydrohalic acids.|$|E
5|$|In an <b>analogous</b> {{manner to}} {{zirconium}} and hafnium, rutherfordium {{is projected to}} form a very stable, refractory oxide, RfO2. It reacts with halogens to form tetrahalides, RfX4, which hydrolyze on contact with water to form oxyhalides RfOX2. The tetrahalides are volatile solids existing as monomeric tetrahedral molecules in the vapor phase.|$|E
5|$|In living systems, {{selenium}} {{is found}} in the amino acids selenomethionine, selenocysteine, and methylselenocysteine. In these compounds, selenium plays a role <b>analogous</b> to that of sulfur. Another naturally occurring organoselenium compound is dimethyl selenide.|$|E
5|$|In morphology, <b>analogous</b> traits {{arise when}} {{different}} species live in similar ways and/or a similar environment, and so {{face the same}} environmental factors. When occupying similar ecological niches (that is, a distinctive way of life) similar problems can lead to similar solutions. The British anatomist Richard Owen {{was the first to}} identify the fundamental difference between analogies and homologies.|$|E
5|$|In the Wujing Zongyao {{and other}} {{military}} texts, the distinction between a bomb and a grenade is ambiguous. At the time, the Chinese usually did not categorize gunpowder weapons according to their delivery method. One of the few exceptions is the shoupao, or hand bomb, which is <b>analogous</b> to the hand grenade.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's regular {{satellites}} {{are believed}} to have formed from a circumplanetary disk, a ring of accreting gas and solid debris <b>analogous</b> to a protoplanetary disk. They may be the remnants of a score of Galilean-mass satellites that formed early in Jupiter's history.|$|E
5|$|On 19October 1936, the air arm was reorganised, and {{renamed the}} Schweizerische Flugwaffe (Department of Aviation and Anti-Aircraft Defense), {{becoming}} an autonomous service under the Swiss Federal Military Department, <b>analogous</b> to the organizational {{autonomy of the}} United States Army Air Forces within the U.S. Army.|$|E
5|$|One {{must prove}} that this {{operation}} is well-defined, dealing with co-Cauchy sequences. Once that task is done, all {{the properties of}} real addition follow immediately from the properties of rational numbers. Furthermore, the other arithmetic operations, including multiplication, have straightforward, <b>analogous</b> definitions.|$|E
5|$|Only {{a limited}} number of {{actinium}} compounds are known including AcF3, AcCl3, AcBr3, AcOF, AcOCl, AcOBr, Ac2S3, Ac2O3 and AcPO4. Except for AcPO4, they are all similar to the corresponding lanthanum compounds. They all contain actinium in the oxidation state +3. In particular, the lattice constants of the <b>analogous</b> lanthanum and actinium compounds differ by only a few percent.|$|E
5|$|Others, {{such as the}} Traditionalist Youth Network, have praised The Daily Stormer for {{its reach}} and influence. Anglin's extreme tone has led some white nationalists to suspect {{that he is an}} {{undercover}} Jew, an accusation he finds <b>analogous</b> to believing that Jewish LGBT activist Allen Ginsberg was an undercover Nazi.|$|E
