25|$|Another {{component}} to filming the show came {{when it was}} decided to use three 35mm film cameras to simultaneously film the show.

Multiple cameras would also allow scenes to be performed in sequence, as a play would be, which was unusual at the time for filmed series.

Design work on what would become the Connecticut class began in 1901. The Secretary of the Navy submitted a request for a new battleship design on 6 March to the Board on Construction.
