40|$|Isotopic and {{spectrophotometric}} assays {{show that}} micromolar concentrations of heavy metal ions (particularly Ag⁺ and Hg²⁺) stimulate ATPase activity but inhibit Ca²⁺ uptake in isolated SR vesicles. Both effects {{are caused by}} increased Ca²⁺ permeability of the membrane, apparently the result of activation of the Ca²⁺ <b>release</b> <b>system</b> of the vesicles due to heavy metal binding to a critical sulfhydryl group associated with the Ca²⁺ release channels. CU²⁺catalyzed co-oxidation of this sulfhydryl with exogenous cysteine to form a mixed disulfide also results in activation of the Ca²⁺ <b>release</b> <b>system.</b> The rate and extent of Cu²⁺/cysteine-induced release is maximal at physiological pH and is inhibited by local anaesthetics and Mg²⁺, suggesting that the redox state of this sulfhydryl {{may play a role}} in activation of the Ca²⁺ <b>release</b> <b>system</b> of intact muscle. Modification of the SR with the proteolytic enzyme trypsin also increases the Ca²⁺ permeability of the SR, and enhances the rate of Ca²⁺ release activated by cAMP, doxorubicin, Hg²⁺, and Cu²⁺/cysteine. The rates of release activated by all reagents are stimulated by a factor of five after five minutes exposure to trypsin. Hg²⁺- and Cu²⁺/cysteine-activated release are not stimulated further, while cAMP- and doxorubicin-activated release continue to increase up to maximum of 20 -fold stimulation after 15 minutes exposure to trypsin. Inhibitors of the Ca²⁺ <b>release</b> <b>system</b> such as Mg²⁺ and ruthenium red still inhibit release from proteolytically modified SR, and the binding affinities of activators and inhibitors to their sites are not significantly altered by proteolysis; only the rates of Ca²⁺ transport are affected. The most probable mechanisms of tryptic stimulation of Ca²⁺ release are (1) removal of a regulatory protein or subunit of the Ca²⁺ <b>release</b> <b>system,</b> making more channels available for transport; (2) increasing the single channel unitary conductance; (3) increasing the open time of activated channels. The biphasic character of proteolytic stimulation of cAMP- and doxorubicin-activated release (as opposed to monophasic stimulation of Hg²⁺- and Cu²⁺/cysteine-activated release} suggests that more than one of the above parameters are involved in tryptic stimulation of the Ca²⁺ <b>release</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{involves a}} combined experimental and modeling study that builds on our previous DOE-sponsored work in investigating how KMnO{sub 4 } {{can be better}} used with in situ remediation of groundwater contaminated by chlorinated ethylenes (e. g., PCE, TCE, DCE). This study aims to provide scientific basis for developing a new long-term, semi-passive ISCO scheme that uses controlled release KMnO{sub 4 } as a reactive barrier component. Specific objectives of the study are (1) to construct controlled release KMnO{sub 4 } as a new reactive barrier component that could deliver permanganate at a controlled rate over long time periods of years, (2) to quantitatively describe release mechanisms associated with the controlled release KMnO{sub 4 }, (3) to demonstrate efficacy of the new remediation scheme using proof-of-concept experiments, and (4) to design advanced forms of controlled <b>release</b> <b>systems</b> through numerical optimization. The new scheme operates in a long-term, semi-passive manner to control spreading of a dissolved contaminant plume with periodic replacement of the controlled release KMnO{sub 4 } installed in the subsurface. As {{a first step in}} developing this remedial concept, we manufactured various prototype controlled release KMnO{sub 4 } forms. Then we demonstrated using column experiments that the controlled release KMnO{sub 4 } could deliver small amount of permanganate into flowing water at controlled rates over long time periods of years. An analytical model was also used to estimate the diffusivities and durations of the controlled release KMnO{sub 4 }. Finally, proof-of-concept flow-tank experiments were performed to demonstrate the efficacy of the controlled release KMnO{sub 4 } scheme in controlling dissolved TCE plume in a long-term, semi-passive manner. Another important thrust of our research effort involved numerical optimization of controlled <b>release</b> <b>systems.</b> This study used a numerical model that is capable of describing release patterns of active agent from controlled <b>release</b> <b>systems</b> of varied forms and applications. We manufactured prototype single- and double-layered matrix-type controlled <b>release</b> <b>systems</b> and tested their release patterns using numerical simulations and column experiments.

The focus of the study is testing the feasibility of order review and <b>release</b> <b>systems</b> application, which proved to be effective in “leaning” the flow of manufacturing companies, to the service supply chain. The influence of one of the main characteristics of services – processing times variability and preciseness in estimating the required processing times, is studied. The research is purely theoretical and was conducted with the help of simulation modeling. The model of the service supply chain was developed based on the literature review and statistical distributions as an input data were used. Two kinds of order review and <b>release</b> <b>systems</b> are considered: upper-bound limited workload and lean-based balanced workload model. Their impact on the performance of the service supply chain is described and compared to the results of the model with immediate release. The findings show that order review and <b>release</b> <b>systems</b> can perform well even in the conditions of unknown exact processing times and thus can be applied to services as well as they are applied in manufacturing. The application of order review and <b>release</b> <b>systems</b> will help to eliminate waste within the service supply chain, make it more flexible and thus increase added value to the customers. ...|$|R
