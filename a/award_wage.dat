State-of-the-art British combing machines were imported, utilising both the traditional Noble type {{and the more}} efficient French type. This enabled {{an increase in the}} overall output of wool tops by 30%, as well as the utilisation of shorter-fibered wool varieties, which previously had been sent overseas for processing. The quality of tops was also improved by this method, producing wool suitable for the manufacture of fine clothing. [...] In 1947, Michell pioneered an incentive wage scheme at the company's Hindmarsh and Fremantle processing facilities, whereby the typical worker could earn an average of 27% above the <b>award</b> <b>wage</b> for production beyond standard output levels.|$|E

40|$|Low {{rates of}} award pay for {{apprentices}} {{have been seen}} as discouraging young people from starting an apprenticeship as well as contributing to low completion rates. This criticism, however, assumes that few apprentices receive above-award payments. Analysis of data from the 2009 Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Survey of Education and Training finds that over-award payments for apprentices are common, especially in the electrotechnology, automotive, and engineering trades. Most trainees also receive over-award payments, particularly existing workers, older trainees, and male trainees. In most cases, the relevant <b>award</b> <b>wage</b> for apprentices and trainees is below the national minimum wage. More importantly, the method for determining the apprentice <b>award</b> <b>wage</b> in most cases {{does not take into account}} age or level of schooling, even though apprentices are increasingly older and are more likely to have completed Year 12.

40|$|The {{important}} and sometimes controversial subject of relativities between youth and adult <b>award</b> <b>wages</b> is {{examined in this}} paper. For {{the first time a}} historical index of <b>award</b> <b>wages</b> applying to youth and adults in Victoria has been constructed. Trends in relative youth/adult wages are shown using the index and explanations of these trends are suggested. Both male and female youth wages have tended to track women’s wages from 1930 to 1970, and hence they rose relative to men’s wages. Between 1970 and 1975, male youth wages declined relative to all other wage groups, thus more closely paralleling female youth wages. From 1975 a new trend is shown to have appeared, with both types of youth wages continuing to rise relative to men’s wages. It is suggested that this break in trend shown in the index is due to the application of different wage principles to women’s wage fixation after the equal pay cases of 1969 and 1972. From this time women’s wages have no longer been adjusted according to their social needs but according to work value, as with men’s wages. The second part of the paper illustrates the wage-fixing principles historically applied and presents some evidence of the social needs principles still being used in youth wage-fixation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the Five Economists' plan for a "wage-tax trade-off", combining an EITC program with a freeze on <b>award</b> <b>wage</b> increases, as a policy package for reducing unemployment. The study identifies the changes in effective tax rates implied by the EITC program and shows that, when combined with a wage cut for the low paid, the proposed plan will increase inequality. Drawing on the findings of empirical research on behavioural responses to taxes, the study then goes on to show that the plan can be expected to reduce the efficiency and growth of the economy, due to disincentive effects on family labour supply, saving and fertility. The structure of the plan is found to have much in common with ongoing labour market and tax-benefit reforms. Both are identified as policy directions that are not in the interests of Australia, either domestically or within the context of globalisation. Taxation, Welfare, Globalization...|$|E
40|$|MONASH is {{a dynamic}} general {{equilibrium}} model of the Australian economy. This article describes a new labour-market specification for MONASH {{in which people are}} allocated in year t to categories according to their labourmarket activities in year t – 1. People in each category plan their labour supplies by solving an optimisation problem. Via these problems, we introduce the assumption that people in employment categories supply labour more strongly to employment activities than do people in unemployment categories. Thus we find that employment-stimulating policies in t – 1 increase labour supply in t by shifting the composition of the labour force in t in favour of employment categories and away from unemployment categories. We illustrate this idea by using MONASH to simulate the Dawkins proposal to combine a freeze on <b>award</b> <b>wage</b> rates with tax credits for low-wage workers in low-income families. We find that the Dawkins policy would generate a significant short-run increase in employment. With the increase in employment generating an increase in labour supply, the employment benefits of the policy would persist over many years. However, in the long run, we would expect the effect of the policy on aggregate employment to be small and to depend on how the policy affected the ratio of real after-tax wage rates to unemployment benefits...|$|E

40|$|Formalised {{enterprise}} bargaining {{has been}} part of the industrial relations framework in Australia since 1991 while formalised individual bargaining was introduced in 1996. Since their introduction formalised collective and individual bargaining have been adopted enthusiastically in some industry sectors; however, the Australian hospitality sector has been unenthusiastic about formalised bargaining.

Artists were engaged in a range of activities of which art production was the prominent means of productive cash income generation. An artist 2 ̆ 7 s residence and also their language community were found to influence the amount of sculpture production undertaken, with artists residing on 2 ̆ 7 country 2 ̆ 7 in the hinterland being more engaged in sculpture production than those living in the township of Maningrida. The annual income earned by an artist for carving was highly variable and a large proportion of woodcarvers also earned income from producing artwork in other media. Capital costs were relatively minor, with travel costs and labour the main input into carving production. Based on the average return for a single woodcarving, 160, we estimate the average hourly return to artists as between 12 and 14. Whilst this figure is relatively low and comparable to the Australian <b>award</b> <b>wage</b> for unskilled labour, the income earned from arts production makes an important contribution to people 2 ̆ 7 s livelihoods...|$|E

This report examines the nature of employment arrangements and conditions of award-reliant employees at higher classifications and the persistence of award reliance over time. The findings depict {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of award-reliant employment as reported by participants. The findings also examine the intentions of participants to pursue an over-award arrangement, either through a change to their wage-setting arrangements in their current workplace or through seeking alternative employment. These intentions were found to be principally shaped by their need to pursue higher wages/wage increases which was related to the reliance they had on their <b>award</b> <b>wage</b> to meet their living costs. Participants with no critical need to increase their wage income were content to maintain their award-reliant arrangement. Participants who had a need to increase their wage at a faster or greater rate than the award provided for tended to be discontent with their award reliance and typically expected their tenure under their award-reliant arrangement would be relatively short. Over the duration of the study, most participants experienced some form of change in their award-reliant employment. Only a small number of participants left their award-reliant employment over the course of the study, despite the intentions of several more to do so. The barriers to pursing and achieving over-award arrangements included perceptions that their employer would not welcome a discussion about wages and wage progression and that they would not be significantly better off if they pursued an over-award arrangement through alternative employment.  ...|$|E
