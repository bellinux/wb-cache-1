She has been cursed for centuries, unable to rest, because she saw Christ on the cross and laughed at His pains. Now she can never weep, only jeer, and she is enslaved to Klingsor as well. Parsifal rejects her again but then asks her to lead him to Amfortas. She begs him {{to stay with her}} for just one hour, and then she will take him to Amfortas. When he still refuses, she curses him to wander without ever finding the Kingdom of the Grail, and finally calls on her master Klingsor to help her.|$|E
5|$|Chi's {{character}} is voiced by Rie Tanaka, and Georgette Rose in its English counterpart. The anime and manga storylines are essentially the same, but they differ slightly. These differences include {{the events in}} the ending, other things such as describing Elda's memory loss, and her special program. In the anime for example, it is explained that Hibiya reset Elda's memories after her husband's death rather than Elda losing them when she took Freya's program in. Another difference is the special program that was placed into Elda in the anime, this program appears to have an alternate effect. If Chi finds the Person just for her, all persocoms would be granted the ability to feel emotion. The reason for this is since Ichiro Mihara was the creator of persocoms, he viewed them all as his children. His wish was that if Chi were able to find someone who loved her in return, all his children would be able to share in this happiness by being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> emotions the way humans do.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the {{acceptance}} of an employment offer, the prospective employee usually {{has the opportunity to}} negotiate the terms of the offer. This primarily focuses on salary, but extends to benefits, work arrangements, and other amenities as well. Negotiating salary can potentially lead the prospective employee to a higher salary. In fact, a 2009 study of employees indicated that those who negotiated salary saw an average increase of $4,913 from their original salary offer. In addition, the employer is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> more confident that they have hired an employee with strong interpersonal skills and the ability to deal with conflict. Negotiating salary will thus likely yield an overall positive outcome for both sides of the bargaining table.|$|E

White noted that, [...] "Jim did bumble it {{a bit in the}} face of Cathy taking insincere offense at his accusation, but the outcome wasn't hard to predict. Of course Jim would stay true to his real soulmate." [...] Sepinwall noted Dwight's cartoonish behavior in the episode, although he called it a good addition to the Jim-Cathy story-line.

500|$|The story follows an {{exploratory}} ship {{sent by the}} League to investigate a newly discovered planet, named World 4470. The team includes Osden, an [...] "empath" [...] who is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> the emotions of those around him; however, he has an abrasive personality that leads to tensions within the team. The ship finds World 4470 to be a world covered in forests, and apparently devoid of animal life. However, the team eventually begins to feel a fear emanating from the planet. The team realizes that the entire vegetation on the planet {{is part of a}} singular consciousness, which is reacting in fear at the explorers after spending its whole life in isolation.|$|E
500|$|In Part II, Varner {{adopts a}} higher-order thought theory of {{consciousness}} and reviews evidence for animal consciousness. He argues that, according to contemporary science, vertebrates are conscious (i.e., sentient, <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> pain), but few invertebrates are; cephalopods are an exception. He {{goes on to}} argue that most animals lack a biographical sense of self, something possessed by paradigmatic humans. A good life for human persons, consequently, [...] "consists in living a good story", meaning that persons can be harmed in ways that non-persons cannot. Varner denies that nonhuman animals lack the psychological sophistication necessary for personhood, but argues that some, nonetheless, may be [...] "near-persons"; this means that they lack a biographical sense of self, but possess autonoetic consciousness. Possible candidates include nonhuman primates, as well as Corvidae, Cetacea and Elephantidae, and rats and parrots. Varner frames the lives of near-persons as of less significance than the lives of persons, but of greater significance than the lives of other animals who are nonetheless sentient. The distinctions drawn in Part II are logically independent of any commitment to utilitarianism, Harean or otherwise.|$|E
50|$|What {{inspired}} the {{weight in the}} back of the head was the idea of being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> better <b>feel</b> (and therefore control) the head of the club. The extra weight allows the head to be felt better throughout the whole swing. Previous models tended to have a very light head and players lost the feeling of where the club was within their swing. The extra weight not only allowed for better control over the club, but also pulled the center of mass away from the face and produce a better launch angle and ball speed.|$|R

500|$|One of {{the main}} goals of the {{narrative}} was to depict war in a manner unlike it is portrayed in media such as TV and books. Another goal was to use the scenarios presented to cause players to raise questions about their thoughts of killing people in a video game {{as a form of}} entertainment. To achieve this, the team made the hints at the game's loading screen increasingly aggressive, while the game's overall narrative was designed with the aim of being [...] "physically opposing", so that players could project themselves into the protagonist's position, especially when making choices that involve the killing of innocents. They hoped that players would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> angry at the developers who [...] "forced" [...] players into killing civilians in the game. The team had a lot of debates regarding the imagery used in depicting violence towards civilians, as many considered it excessive and unnecessary. However, 2K approved their vision even when the team thought they had pushed the narrative to extremes.|$|E

According to Cyrus, the album documented, in depth, the events that occurred in her life in a year span.

Recording commenced immediately after the tour came to an end, and seized in March 2008, for Cyrus was to film [...] (2009) in Tennessee soon after.

He also presents {{the idea of}} the revolution of sea and land, although not many other critics agree. Sonnet 64 catalogues instances of inevitable destruction so as to provide a consolation for death and places [...] "emphasis on the inescapable fact of mutability". Because of the inevitability and finality of death, Shakespeare's lover is not choosing to leave him. On the contrary, his lover could not do anything about it. In this way, Shakespeare is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> better about himself, because {{the love of his life}} was taken from him involuntarily.
