He had long {{wanted to make a}} film <b>about</b> <b>food</b> and chefs, and felt that the subject was suited to a small-scale independent film rather than a big-budget production. He cited Jiro Dreams of Sushi, Eat Drink Man Woman and Big Night as inspirations for creating a food-centric film.|$|E
5|$|One {{building}} at the Seventh Day Adventist church primary school collapsed while another sustained severe damage. Although damage occurred at Vaitau School, it was utilized as an evacuation shelter. The primary school and college in Araura also suffered damage. The island's electrically run water supply was substantially effected. A total of 568homes lost access to clean water, with many waters tanks damaged or destroyed. Aitutaki's only hospital fared well through the storm, with some roof damage and flooded rooms. Infrastructural losses totaled to NZ$2.3million (US$1.6million), mainly stemming from the power grid. The agricultural sector sustained extensive damage, amounting to US$1.5million, with some crops experiencing a total loss. The severity of damage raised concerns <b>about</b> <b>food</b> security {{in the months after}} the storm. Particularly hard-hit was the mango crop, which was to be harvested two weeks after Pat struck. Approximately 60–75percent of the coconut trees and 75percent of java plum, mango, and kapok trees sustained damage. Most trees had at least one branch torn off and in most cases, multiple branches. Additionally, the blue lorikeet (Vini peruviana), a bird native to French Polynesia and the Cook Islands, population suffered dramatic losses due to the storm, with the population on Aitutaki dropping by more than 50percent.|$|E
50|$|In a {{study done}} by J. Mojet and E.P. Köster, {{participants}} were asked to have a drink, yoghurt, and some biscuits for breakfast. A few hours later, they were asked to identify and the items they had during breakfast out of five variations of the drinks, yoghurts, and biscuits. The results showed that participants remember the texture of the foods much better than for fatty content, although they could discern the difference of both among the different items. Participants were also most certain <b>about</b> <b>foods</b> {{that they did not have}} during breakfast, but were the least certain <b>about</b> <b>foods</b> that they said were in their breakfast and <b>about</b> <b>foods</b> that were in their breakfast but were not recognized. This suggests that incidental and implicit memory for foods are more focused on discerning new and potentially unsafe food rather than remembering the details of familiar foods.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{attempted}} {{to determine the}} effect that gastrointestinal discomforts, socioeconomic status, dietary knowledge and beliefs <b>about</b> <b>foods</b> to omit during pregnancy had on the nutritional status of pregnant women. Hemoglobin, upper arm muscle circumference, weight for height and eating patterns measured nutritional status. Twenty women in their second trimester of pregnancy, active duty or the dependent wife of an Air Force E- 4 and below, were surveyed. Questionnaires and anthropometric measures were used. Pearson Product Moment Correlations and a canonical correlation were accomplished. Data analysis indicated a significant negative correlation between eating patterns and gastrointestinal discomfort. There was a significant positive correlation between beliefs <b>about</b> <b>foods</b> to omit and eating patterns. Significant negative correlations existed between dietary knowledge and military status, monthly grocery bill, and number of people fed...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Food {{insecurity}} {{is defined}} as not having access at all times to enough food for an active and healthy life-style. A Healthy People 2010 objective is to increase food security and {{reduce the risk of}} hunger for all households. The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize the prevalence of concern <b>about</b> enough <b>food</b> and its association with other sociodemographic and health characteristics at the state level. METHODS: Adult respondents participating in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey provided information on concern <b>about</b> enough <b>food</b> from nine states from 1996 through 1999. RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of concern <b>about</b> enough <b>food</b> ranged from 3. 1 % to 11. 8 % for individual states. Across states, low household income was the strongest predictor of concern <b>about</b> enough <b>food.</b> The odds of being concerned <b>about</b> enough <b>food</b> were generally higher among respondents who were female, younger, and without health care coverage. The odds were generally lower among those reporting excellent or very good general health and among non-Hispanic whites. CONCLUSION: Food security scales could be used at the state level to track progress for the Healthy People 2010 objective of reducing food insecurity and hunger across American households...|$|R

25|$|In the UK, scepticism <b>about</b> <b>food</b> {{intolerance}} as {{a specific}} condition influenced doctors' (GPs') perceptions of patients and of the patients' underlying problems. However, rather than risk damaging the doctor-patient relationship, GPs chose - despite their scepticism and guided by an element of awareness {{of the limitations of}} modern medicine - to negotiate mutually acceptable ground with patients and with patients' beliefs. As a result, whether due to a placebo effect, a secondary benefit, or a biophysical result of excluding a food from the diet, the GPs acknowledge both personal and therapeutic benefits.|$|E

25|$|These {{statistics}} {{point to}} the complexities surrounding the lack of health/nutrition literacy and reveal {{the degree to which}} they are embedded in the social structure and interconnected with other problems. Among these problems are the lack of information <b>about</b> <b>food</b> choices, a lack of understanding of nutritional information and its application to individual circumstances, limited or difficult access to healthful foods, and a range of cultural influences and socioeconomic constraints such as low levels of education and high levels of poverty that decrease opportunities for healthful eating and living.|$|E
25|$|On 3 August, the {{prefecture}} Shimane, {{in western}} Japan, conducted radiation checks on all beef cattle to ease consumer concerns <b>about</b> <b>food</b> safety. Starting {{from the second}} week of August all cattle were tested. Late July at one farm in this prefecture rice-straw was discovered with radioactive caesium levels exceeding the government safety guide. Although all other tests of beef cattle found far lower levels of radioactivity than the government standard, prices of beef from Shimane plummeted and wholesalers avoided all cattle from the prefecture. All processed beef would undergo preliminary screening, and meat registering 250 becquerels per kilogram or more of radioactive caesium – half the government safety level – would be tested further.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, higher {{incentives}} for farmers to grow non-food biofuel crops {{combined with other}} factors, such as over development of former farm lands, rising transportation costs, climate change, growing consumer demand in China and India, and population growth, caused food shortages in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Mexico, as well as rising food prices around the globe. As of December 2007, 37 countries faced food crises, and 20 had imposed some sort of food-price controls. Some of these shortages resulted in food riots and even deadly stampedes. The International Fund for Agricultural Development posits that an increase in smallholder agriculture {{may be part of}} the solution to concerns <b>about</b> <b>food</b> prices and overall food security. They in part base this on the experience of Vietnam, which went from a food importer to large food exporter and saw a significant drop in poverty, due mainly to the development of smallholder agriculture in the country.|$|E
