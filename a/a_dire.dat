5|$|In this period, Germany {{was still}} in <b>a</b> <b>dire</b> {{economic}} situation as millions were unemployed and the balance of trade deficit was daunting. Hitler knew that reviving the economy was vital. In 1934, using deficit spending, public works projects were undertaken. A total of 1.7 million Germans were put {{to work on the}} projects in 1934 alone. Average wages both per hour and per week began to rise.|$|E
5|$|On 9 April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway. This {{operation}} preempted Britain's own {{plans to}} invade Norway. Denmark surrendered immediately, and, after a short-lived {{attempt by the}} British to make a stand {{in the northern part}} of the country, Norway also fell. The invasion of Norway was a combined forces operation in which the German war machine projected its power across the sea; this German success would come to be seen by the British as <b>a</b> <b>dire</b> portent.|$|E
5|$|Gordon, {{operating}} out of Khartoum, helped extricate many loyal civilians who remained in Sudan, but refused ultimately to abandon the city. Contrary to his orders, he retained a small force in Khartoum and determined to give battle with the Mahdi before relinquishing control. Accordingly, Mahdist forces besieged Khartoum in March 1884, isolating the city {{from the outside world}} and placing <b>a</b> <b>dire</b> timer upon Gordon to surrender. After much delay, the British government reluctantly dispatched a relief expedition under Sir Garnet Wolseley that would rapidly follow the Nile to Khartoum. Wolseley's column arrived on 28 January 1885, two days after Khartoum had fallen and General Charles Gordon's head delivered to the Mahdi.|$|E

5|$|Macrinus {{had several}} {{issues that he}} needed to deal with {{at the time of his}} accession, which had been left behind by his predecessor. As Caracalla had a {{tendency}} towards military belligerence, rather than diplomacy, this left several conflicts for Macrinus to resolve. Additionally, Caracalla had been a profligate spender of Rome's income. Most of the money was spent on the army; he had greatly increased their pay from 2,000 sesterces to 3,000 sesterces per year. The increased expenditures forced Caracalla to strip bare whatever sources of income he had to supply the difference. This shortfall left Rome in <b>a</b> <b>dire</b> fiscal situation that Macrinus needed to address.|$|E
5|$|News of Mulder's arrest spreads to the FBI. Upon {{hearing that}} he has resurfaced, and in such <b>a</b> <b>dire</b> manner, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) visit him in {{military}} custody. During his time in captivity, Mulder receives mysterious visits from two phantoms of his past: Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) and X (Steven Williams). Meanwhile, Scully and Skinner {{go to great lengths}} to get him released, but are unsuccessful. Mulder's fate is ultimately made the subject of a military tribunal with Deputy Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.) in charge. At the outset, it appears Mulder will become the hopeless victim of a show trial stacked against him.|$|E
5|$|Situated in the Burnden area of Bolton, {{approximately}} one {{mile from the}} centre of the town, the ground served as the home of the town's football team for 102 years. In its heyday, Burnden Park could hold up to 70,000 supporters but this figure was dramatically reduced during the final 20 years of its life. A section of The Embankment was sold off in 1986 {{to make way for a}} new Normid superstore. At this time, Bolton were in <b>a</b> <b>dire</b> position financially and were struggling in the Football League Third Division, so there was a low demand for tickets and the loss of part of the ground gave the Bolton directors good value for money.|$|E

5|$|After the election, Reid orchestrated a quick {{transfer}} of power. The Social Credit victory had provoked a bank run, {{and he wanted}} to re-establish stability as quickly as possible. Moreover, the province needed to borrow a large sum of money to meet even its short-term obligations, and the UFA, as a lame duck government, was unable to make promises to would-be creditors. Once in office, confronted with <b>a</b> <b>dire</b> financial situation, Aberhart accused the UFA government of mismanagement. Reid responded in January 1936 that there had been no such mismanagement, that the province's financial problems were due to Social Credit's policies, both real and promised, and that had the UFA won re-election in 1935 it could have continued governing without serious difficulty. He also resisted insinuations that it had been too restrained in helping impoverished farmers: as late as 1969 he was offering the view that shrinking sources of provincial revenue made further assistance impossible.|$|E
5|$|Royal assent or {{sanction}} is {{the method}} by which a country's monarch (possibly through a delegated official) formally approves an act of that nation's parliament. In certain nations, such assent makes the act law (promulgation) while in other nations assent is distinct from promulgation. In {{the vast majority of}} contemporary monarchies, this act is considered to be little more than a formality; even in those nations which still permit their monarchs to withhold royal assent (such as the United Kingdom, Norway, and Liechtenstein), the monarch almost never does so, save in <b>a</b> <b>dire</b> political emergency or upon the advice of their government. While the power to withhold royal assent was once exercised often in European monarchies, it is exceedingly rare in the modern, democratic political atmosphere that has developed there since the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Wreck-It Ralph is a 2012 American 3D computer-animated fantasy-comedy film {{produced}} by Walt Disney Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures.

The film {{was directed by}} Rich Moore, who has directed episodes of The Simpsons and Futurama, and the screenplay was written by Phil Johnston and Jennifer Lee from a story by Moore, Johnston, and Jim Reardon. John Lasseter served as the executive producer. The film features the voices of John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Jack McBrayer, and Jane Lynch. The film {{tells the story of}} the eponymous arcade game villain who rebels against his role and dreams of becoming a hero.

5|$|Alonso quickly progressed {{through the}} youth ranks and the reserve team at Real Sociedad (winning the regionalised fourth tier in his single {{season with the}} latter) and {{impressed}} enough to earn a first team debut {{at the age of}} 18. He made his first senior appearance against Logroñés in December 1999 in a Copa del Rey match. Alonso failed to make another appearance in the season but the following year brought more opportunities. At the beginning of the 2000–01 season, Javier Clemente sent him to Segunda División team Eibar to gain experience. Alonso's father particularly felt the move to the smaller club improved him as a player. A quick turnover of managers, however, including a two-month period with Periko Alonso in charge, left Real Sociedad in <b>a</b> <b>dire</b> situation. By January 2001, Real Sociedad were bottom of the league and its new manager, John Toshack, turned to the prodigious Alonso in the hope of reversing the team's fortunes. In a surprise move, the Welsh manager made the 20-year-old the team captain, a position traditionally held by more senior players. By the end of the season, Sociedad had climbed out of the relegation zone and finished in 14th place. Toshack lauded Alonso, noting that the impression he had on the team was exceptional, especially for a player from the youth team.|$|E
5|$|Four years later, Patton {{was elected}} Governor over Republican Larry Forgy. The major {{achievement}} {{of his first}} term was overhauling higher education, including making the state's community colleges and technical schools independent of the University of Kentucky and organizing them into the Kentucky Community and Technical College System. Shortly after Patton turned back a weak challenge to his re-election in 1999, two Democratic state senators defected to the Republican Party, giving Republicans a majority in that legislative house {{for the first time}} ever. The economic prosperity that fueled Patton's first term success faded into a recession in the early 2000s. Faced with a hostile legislature and <b>a</b> <b>dire</b> economic forecast, Patton was unable to enact much significant legislation in his second term, and his situation was exacerbated in 2002 when news of an extramarital affair and allegations of a sex-for-favors scandal broke. After initially denying the affair, Patton later admitted to it, but continued to deny using his office to benefit his mistress. Later in his term, Patton was attacked for pardoning four of his political advisers who were indicted for violating Kentucky's campaign finance laws and for allegedly abusing his patronage powers. These successive scandals derailed any further political aspirations.|$|E
5|$|The Panthers {{moved to}} the new National Ice Centre in September 2000 but endured a terrible first season in their new home. They were knocked out at the semi final stage of the Benson & Hedges Cup by the Steelers and {{suffered}} <b>a</b> <b>dire</b> first half to the regular season. By Christmas the team faced the prospect of not qualifying for {{the playoffs for the}} first time since 1985. Form improved during the second half of the season with the team winning five of their first seven home games during 2001, including a 6–4 victory over the Sheffield Steelers marred by a violent bench clearing brawl. The Panthers still lay in ninth and last place going into their final game of the regular season, three points behind their opponents Newcastle Jesters. Nottingham required a regulation time win to claim the eighth and final playoff berth, something they had not done away from their home ice all season. The Jesters needed only to tie. With 10.1 seconds to go, the game was locked at 2–2, but with an extra attacker the Panthers won a faceoff next to the Newcastle goal and Robert Nordmark scored with 4.4 seconds remaining to take them into the playoffs and eliminate the Jesters. In the playoffs a 5–0 win over a financially troubled Sheffield Steelers was their only victory of the post season.|$|E
