The head bears a large pair of compound eyes which give all-round vision, three simple eyes which can detect light and dark, and a pair of thread-like antennae that are sensitive to touch <b>and</b> <b>smell.</b> <b>The</b> downward-directed mouthparts are modified for chewing and there are two sensory palps in front of the jaws.|$|E
5|$|Following Stop <b>and</b> <b>Smell</b> <b>the</b> Roses, Starr's {{recording}} {{projects were}} beset with problems. After completing Old Wave in 1982 with producer Joe Walsh, {{he was unable}} to find a record company willing to release the album in the UK or the US. In 1987, he abandoned sessions in Memphis for a planned country album, produced by Chips Moman, after which Moman was blocked by a court injunction from issuing the recordings. Starr nevertheless maintained a high public profile through his narration over 1984–86 of the popular children's series Thomas & Friends, a Britt Allcroft production based on the books by the Reverend W. Awdry. For a single season in 1989, Starr also portrayed the character Mr. Conductor in the programme's American spin-off, Shining Time Station.|$|E
5|$|Pudús have various {{methods of}} obtaining the foliage they need. Their small stature and {{cautious}} nature create obstacles in attaining food. They stop often while searching for food {{to stand on}} their hind legs <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> wind, detecting food scents. Females and fawns peel bark from saplings using their teeth, but mature males may use their spikelike antlers. The deer may use their front legs to press down on saplings until they snap or become low enough to the ground so they can reach the leaves. Forced to stand on their hind legs due to their small size, the deer climb branches and tree stumps to reach higher foliage. They bend bamboo shoots horizontally in order to walk on them and eat from higher branches.|$|E

25|$|Castaneda {{makes the}} reader {{experience}} {{the pressure of}} mysterious winds and the shiver of leaves at twilight, the hunter's peculiar alertness to sound <b>and</b> <b>smell,</b> <b>the</b> rock-bottom scrubbiness of Indian life, the raw fragrance of tequila and the vile, fibrous taste of peyote, the dust in the car, and the loft of a crow's flight. It is a superbly concrete setting, dense with animistic meaning. This is just as well, {{in view of the}} utter weirdness of the events that happen in it.|$|E
500|$|Starr overdubbed his vocals on 4 December, {{four days}} before the murder of John Lennon, who had been due to record his {{contributions}} to Stop <b>and</b> <b>Smell</b> <b>the</b> Roses in January 1981. Contrasting with his success as a solo artist in 1971–73, the album continued Starr's run of commercial and critical failures since 1976; Rodriguez writes that [...] "ost people either love or hate the revamping" [...] of [...] "Back Off Boogaloo".|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were favorable, though. Erik Himmelsbach of Spin criticized Slap-Happy for {{essentially}} {{being the}} same as all of the band's previous albums, commenting [...] "What was once fast and loose and dump now sounds lazy and stupid". Raoul Hernandez of The Austin Chronicle heavily criticized {{the second half of}} the album for being [...] "one long, nasal, wise-ass line after wise-ass line from Donita Sparks, who [...] is quickly becoming self-parody." [...] Although the album received a mixed reaction from media outlets, Sparks retrospectively regards Slap-Happy as [...] "a good record", and considers it be her third favorite L7 album, behind The Beauty Process <b>and</b> <b>Smell</b> <b>the</b> Magic.|$|E

500|$|Starr re-recorded [...] "Back Off Boogaloo" [...] for his 1981 album Stop <b>and</b> <b>Smell</b> <b>the</b> Roses, in a {{collaboration}} with American singer Harry Nilsson that incorporates lyrics from Beatles {{songs such as}} [...] "With a Little Help from My Friends", [...] "Good Day Sunshine" [...] and [...] "Baby, You're a Rich Man". The original version has appeared on Starr's compilation albums Blast from Your Past and , and as a bonus track on his remastered 1974 studio album Goodnight Vienna. Since his return to touring in 1989, Starr has performed [...] "Back Off Boogaloo" [...] regularly {{in concert with the}} various incarnations of his All-Starr Band.|$|E
500|$|Starr {{recorded}} {{a new version}} of [...] "Back Off Boogaloo" [...] for his 1981 album on Boardwalk Records, Stop <b>and</b> <b>Smell</b> <b>the</b> Roses. The song was produced by Starr's friend, singer Harry Nilsson, and features a musical arrangement by Van Dyke Parks. Similar to Nilsson's 1968 cover of the Beatles' [...] "You Can't Do That", the remake incorporates lyrics from a number of the band's songs – in this case, [...] "With a Little Help from My Friends", [...] "Help!", [...] "Lady Madonna", [...] "Good Day Sunshine" [...] and [...] "Baby, You're a Rich Man", as well as Starr's [...] "It Don't Come Easy". In a further reference to his past, the 1981 version of [...] "Back Off Boogaloo" [...] opens with the same guitar riff that Harrison had played on [...] "It Don't Come Easy" [...] ten years before.|$|E
500|$|Fez has no enemies, bosses, or punishments for failure—the player-character quickly respawns upon {{falling to}} his death. The game's {{designer}} described Fez as a stop <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> flowers' kind of game". It prioritizes puzzle-solving and patience over the platforming genre's traditional interest in dexterity. Fez features a pixelated art style and a limited color palette {{reminiscent of the}} 8-bit era. Its homage includes Tetris tetrominos inscribed {{on the walls and}} in the sky, The Legend of Zelda treasure chest animations, Super Mario Bros. mushroom levels, travel by pipe, and floating platforms. The game's settings include forests, factories, a coastal lighthouse, an urban city, and a library. Fez New Game Plus mode adds a first-person perspective feature and lets the player revisit areas to collect [...] "anti-cubes" [...] from harder puzzles. This second half of the game is more challenging and focuses on code cracking.|$|E

500|$|Following Lennon's {{murder in}} December 1980, Harrison {{modified}} {{the lyrics of}} a song he had originally written for Starr, [...] "All Those Years Ago", {{as a tribute to}} their former bandmate. Released as a Harrison single in 1981, the track, which included Starr's drum part and overdubbed backing vocals by Paul and Linda McCartney, peaked at number two in the US charts and number 13 in the UK. Later that year, Starr released Stop <b>and</b> <b>Smell</b> <b>the</b> Roses, featuring songs produced by Nilsson, McCartney, Harrison, Ronnie Wood and Stephen Stills. The album's lead single, the Harrison-composed [...] "Wrack My Brain", reached number 38 in the US charts, but failed to chart in the UK. Lennon had offered a pair of songs for inclusion on the album – [...] "Nobody Told Me" [...] and [...] "Life Begins at 40" [...] – but following his death, Starr did not feel comfortable recording them. Soon after the murder, Starr and his girlfriend Barbara Bach flew to New York City to be with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono.|$|E

2500|$|Later, he {{also became}} known as a country singer. During the 1970s, many of his songs [...] "crossed over", {{successfully}} scoring on both the country and popular music charts, including [...] "Baby, Don't Get Hooked on Me" [...] (a number one Grammy-nominated success), [...] "One Hell of a Woman" [...] (popular no.11), and [...] "Stop <b>and</b> <b>Smell</b> <b>the</b> Roses" [...] (a no.9 popular hit). Also, during the 1970s, he was very active as an actor, appearing in several movies, as well as hosting his own successful variety show.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2001, {{the album}} Wake Up <b>and</b> <b>Smell</b> <b>the</b> Coffee was released. The band's old {{producer}} Stephen Street had returned and produced their new music video.

2500|$|Another {{connection}} to Blake's later mythology {{is found in}} The Vales of Har, which are mentioned in The Book of Thel (1789). It is in the Vales where lives Thel herself, and throughout the poem they are represented {{as a place of}} purity and innocence; [...] "I walk through the vales of Har. <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> sweetest flowers" [...] (3:18). At the end of the poem, when Thel is shown the world of experience outside the Vales, she panics and flees back to the safety of her home; [...] "The Virgin started from her seat, & with a shriek./Fled back unhinderd till she came into the vales of Har" [...] (6:21-22).|$|E

2500|$|After {{dominance}} {{has been}} established, the rams begin to select their ewes. Although Marco Polo sheep rams {{are known to}} herd females, during the rut males pair off with females to reproduce. Males will approach a flock of females <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> urine of possible mates. When smelling the ewe's urine, the males display the Flehmen response to test if the ewe is in estrus. Shackleton calls this phenomenon [...] "lip-curl" [...] and describes it as [...] "raising {{the head with the}} mouth open and upper lip curled back." [...] The ram then splits from the flock to copulate with his ewe and afterward will often stay with the flock for a month or two.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{descriptions}} of Marbury village {{and the surrounding}} countryside survive from {{the first half of}} the 20th century. Ornithologist T. A. Coward wrote around 1900: [...] "What a country this is, wooded hills, none of them high, lanes bordered with luxuriant vegetation that tempts one to potter <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> honeysuckle or pick the wild roses; meres or pools in almost every hollow." [...] Almost 50 years later, little had changed; local author Beatrice Tunstall described the village in 1948 as [...] "far from the madding crowd", and praised the [...] "ancient lanes, deep trodden by the feet of endless generation, flower fringed amid the woodlands, with great hedges where honeysuckle and wild roses riot." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1974, Davis {{was awarded}} the Academy of Country Music's Entertainer of the Year award.

At {{the end of the}} 1970s, he moved to Casablanca Records, which was best known at the time for its successes with disco star Donna Summer and rock'n'roll band Kiss. His first success for the company in 1980 was the novelty song [...] "It's Hard To Be Humble", a light-hearted look at how {{popularity}} and good looks could go to one's head. The song became his first Country music top 10 and a rare top 30 hit in the UK. (It was translated into Dutch as [...] "Het is moeilijk bescheiden te blijven" [...] and became a hit for the Dutch singer Peter Blanker in 1981). Later that year, he also had another top 10 song with [...] "Let's Keep It That Way". In November, [...] "Rock'n'Roll (I Gave You The Best Years Of My Life)" [...] was played by KHJ in Los Angeles as its last song before it switched from Top 40 to Country music. He achieved other successful songs, such as [...] "Texas In My Rear View Mirror" [...] and [...] "Hooked on Music", which became his biggest Country music success in 1981, going to no.2. In 1985, he recorded his last top 10 country music success with the song [...] "I Never Made Love (Till I Made Love With You)".|$|E
