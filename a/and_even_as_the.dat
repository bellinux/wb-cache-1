In the weeks leading up to the 2006 Rose Bowl, the game was {{described}} by numerous publications as one of the most-anticipated match-ups in college football history <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> greatest college football game of all time. This was Texas' secondtrip to the Rose Bowl in school history, alongside their trip the previous season.|$|E
25|$|Older adults {{continue}} to report {{high levels of}} personal satisfaction in their friendships as they age, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> overall number of friends tends to decline. This satisfaction is {{associated with an increased}} ability to accomplish activities of daily living, as well as a reduced decline in cognitive abilities, decreased instances of hospitalization, and better outcomes related to rehabilitation. The overall number of reported friends in later life may be mediated by increased lucidity, better speech and vision, and marital status.|$|E
500|$|Blink-182 is {{considered}} a key group {{in the development of}} pop punk; the band's combination of pop melodies with fast-paced punk rock featured a more radio-friendly accessibility than prior bands. The trio has sold over thirteen million albums in the United States, and over 50 million albums worldwide. In 2011, The New York Times asserted, [...] "no punk band of the 1990s has been more influential than Blink-182," [...] <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> band receded after its 2005 split, [...] "its sound and style could be heard in the muscular pop punk of Fall Out Boy or in the current wave of high-gloss Warped Tour punk bands, like All Time Low and The Maine." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of his bout with Sakuraba, Renzo's only loss in 10 bouts was a closely contested {{decision}} to Sakuraba's former UWFi stablemate and rival, Kiyoshi Tamura while Maurice Smith, Oleg Taktarov and Abu Dhabi champion Sanae Kikuta numbered amongst his victims. Renzo's stylistic differences from his cousins were in evidence from the outset of his contest against Sakuraba, as he pressed the pace of the bout with a variety of kicks and punches, although few connected. Sakuraba responded in kind, and the striking seemed to go to a stalemate. Throwing his wrestling into the equation, Sakuraba timed a number of double and single leg takedowns against Renzo's flurries from where he alternately attempted to cartwheel past Gracie's guard, malign his legs with kicks from the standing position and even attack with a baseball slide. However, Renzo's defensive skills from bottom nullified the entire gamut of Sakuraba's offensive attempts, and after using an entry derived from the De la Riva guard, he took the wrestler's back, pressing him against the turnbuckle as mere seconds remained in the battle. Then, performing his own reversion, Sakuraba locked in a kimura from the back and spun around, flipping Renzo to the canvas even as he wrenched his arm behind his back. Like Royler and Helio before him, Renzo refused to submit to the hold despite his elbow being snapped prior to hitting the ground <b>and,</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> referee stopped the contest due to the injury, which awarded victory to Sakuraba. His arm in a sling, Renzo took the microphone and, before the 35,000 fans assembled at the Seibu Dome, stated that Sakuraba was [...] "the Japanese version of the Gracie family". Renzo has since referred to the bout as his proudest moment in mixed martial arts.|$|E

50|$|Venice is also {{linked to}} the {{technological}} aspects of writing. The city was the location of one of Italy's earliest printing presses, established by Aldus Manutius (1449-1515).
