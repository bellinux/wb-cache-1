50|$|Founded in 1949 by Dr. Lino Pasquali, {{the company}} began {{production}} of two-wheel tractors, and in the late 1950s ergonomic improvements such as rubber tires, seat, and steering handles were added. In the late 1960s a line of <b>articulated</b> four-wheel <b>tractors</b> was added. In 1999, the BCS group purchased the Pasquali brand. Pasquali machines work all over the world, {{with a wide range}} of motor mowers, two-wheel tractors, and specialized tractors with power up to 100 hp.

50|$|For a long while, it {{was common}} to use 'dollies' to recover vehicles. These were cranes and underlifts as above, but mounted on a two-wheeled axle. They were {{designed}} to be towed behind a suitable towing vehicle. Another portable device was a crane, which clipped on to an <b>articulated</b> <b>tractor</b> unit's fifth wheel coupling. Popular in the seventies and eighties, they were cheap to buy (compared with a purpose-built recovery vehicle) and appealed to fleet operators, who could use them to recover their own vehicles. Total lift dollies were carried by some spectacle lifts to place under the wheels {{at the opposite end}} to the lifted wheels, thereby converting the half lift into a total lift. These are used, for example, when a vehicle has had an accident and both ends are damaged.|$|E
50|$|Ferrari is a {{manufacturer}} of two and four wheel tractors devoted to agriculture and lawn care. It was created in 1954, during the agricultural reconstruction period of the country. After an initial period dedicated {{to the production of}} wire-drawing machines for irrigation pipes, in 1957 Ferrari took part in the Verona exhibition with its first agricultural machine: the two-wheel tractor MC 57, which carries the date of its birth. In 1965 Ferrari launched the first <b>articulated</b> <b>tractor</b> MT65. The range of products was increased to motor mowers and tractors for diverse applications. At the end of the 1960s, the company looked to foreign markets; the subsidiary company Ferrari France was established in 1972. In 1988 Ferrari became part of the BCS Group. Today Ferrari has a wide range of machines between maintenance machines for recreational use and professional tractors for niche agriculture. Headquarters and factories are located at Abbiategrasso.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of a research dealing with operating efficiency of <b>articulated</b> and <b>tractor</b> assemblies in the plots of poplar plantations in which different means of work were used for felling and cross-cutting. The aim was to study the effects of the arrangement of wood assortments on the driving speed of the vehicle, the time needed to load and manipulate the vehicle and the overall working efficiency of forwarders. The research was carried out in Vojvodina, in the area of PE »Vojvodina šume«. Altogether 170 transport cycles were recorded and 2166. 73 m 3 transported. The research results show that the forwarder moved faster on the felling site where the felling and cross-cutting operations were carried out by a harvester. The speed was 10 % higher and it took 5 % less time to load the forwarder. The differences were considerably greater concerning the manipulation time (maneuvering and positioning the vehicle during the loading). The driving speed decreased with an increase in the load volume. Fuel consumption was lower in the felling site where a harvester was used for felling. Under the same working conditions, the tractor assembly achieved better productivity because it drove at considerably higher speeds. The differences in the average load volume were not so great, which significantly affected the productivity of the tractor assembly. The initial hypothesis that a forwarder achieves better working efficiency in the felling site, where a harvester has been used in the operations of felling and cross-cutting, was confirmed...|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the cars}} offered 20 years ago are still offered today, but new models have also been released, {{including}} classic Bugattis and racing Mercedes-Benzes. The focus, however, is still on French Peugeots, Citroens, Renaults and older French makes including the likes of Panhard and Talbot. It is also interesting that Eligor offers several variations on the Dacia Logan, which, of course, is basically a Renault made in Romania. New and old models continue to be offered {{in a variety of}} detailed liveries. As time has passed Eligor resembles revered (but less sophisticated) Solido and Vitesse less and less and Brumm and Rio Models more and more.Into the new millennium, Eligor now offers a complete set of trucks and buses, mostly in 1:64 scale - about 30 different models are available in several hundred different liveries (Eligor Vintage 2003). One emphasis is on racing trucks and racing liveries (Kamaz and Renault) while standard <b>articulated</b> <b>tractor</b> trailer rigs seem a backbone. Mercedes, Freightliner, and Renault vans are also offered. DAF, MAN, Freightliner, Mercedes, Volvo, Kamaz, Renault, historic Sinpar and Hotchkiss, Iveco, and Scania are all represented. In this area, the company has built up its promotional offerings, especially with silk screening {{on the sides of the}} trucks - sort of becoming the French Winross. The Eligor website runs through more than 25 different liveries that have been produced for different (mostly European) companies.|$|E
50|$|The maximum {{overall length}} in the EU and EEA member states was 18.75 m with a maximum weight of 40 tonnes, or 44 tonnes if {{carrying}} an ISO container. However, rules limiting the semi-trailers to 16.5 m and 18.75 m are met with trucks carrying a standardized 7.82 m body with one additional 7.82 m body on tow as a trailer. 25.25 metre truck combinations were developed under the branding of EcoCombi which influenced the name of EuroCombi for an ongoing standardization effort where such truck combinations shall be legal to operate in all jurisdictions of the European Economic Area. With the 50% increase in cargo weight, the fuel efficiency increases {{with an average of}} 20% with a corresponding relative decrease in carbon emissions and with the added benefit of one third fewer trucks on the road. The 1996 EU regulation defines a Europe Module System (EMS) as it was implemented in Sweden. The wording of EMS combinations and EuroCombi are now used interchangeably to point to truck combinations as specified in the EU document; however apart from Sweden and Finland the EuroCombi is only allowed to operate on specific tracks in other EU member states. Since 1996, when Sweden and Finland formally won a final exemption from the European Economic Area rules with 60 tonne and 25.25 m combinations, all other From 2006, 25.25 m truck trailer combinations are to be allowed on restricted routes within Germany, following a similar (on-going) trial in The Netherlands. Similarly, Denmark has allowed 25.25 m combinations on select routes. These vehicles will run a 60 tonne weight limit. Two types are to be used: 1) a 26 tonne truck pulling a dolly and semi-trailer, or 2) an <b>articulated</b> <b>tractor</b> unit pulling a B-double, member states gained the ability to adopt the same rules. In Italy the maximum permitted weight (unless exceptional transport is authorized) is 44 tonnes for any kind of combination with five axles or more.|$|E
40|$|A new {{reversible}} wheeled <b>articulated</b> <b>tractor,</b> {{designed to}} work in terraced vineyards trained with “pergola” system, common in mountain areas, is here described in its latest version and analysed through numerical simulations. This tractor has small dimensions, necessary to operate in that environment, and its central articulation has two rotational degrees-offreedom. The described features are surely strong design points but could be critical for vehicle’s stability, as affecting the supporting base’s dimensions and shape. Therefore, the tractor was equipped with a new automatic safety system: a self-locking articulation activated by contact sensors on the wheels. This device makes the vehicle partially-rigid in case of lateral unbalancing, so that rollover can happen only by overcoming the whole vehicle mass. A mathematical description of vehicle-ground interactions was implemented to deeply inquiry the tractor behaviour in different configurations (straight, angled) at increasing values of ground slope; roll and pitch stability indexes were then computed and used for comparisons with conventional tractors. Thanks to the low centre-of-gravity, the resulting rollover angle with the vehicle in straight configuration is promising (43. 8 °→ 96 %) : it {{is greater than the}} maximum lateral (20 °→ 36 %) and frontal (38 °→ 78 %) slope angle ever recorded on terraced vineyards. The same rollover angle is lower when the tractor turns...|$|E
5000|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, {{agricultural}} infrastructure in the Soviet Union (USSR) was in a poor state, production of agricultural machinery having been non existent during the later years of the War. Those tractors and machinery still working on the Large Collective Farms were tired from heavy use and also dated, most having been produced in the early 1930s or earlier. At best these tractors were unreliable and were poorly maintained. The Communist state ordered new tractors to be made at several locations within the USSR, the main assembly plant for MTZ being in Minsk, Belarus, with smaller tractors being produced in other locations, while other factories produced high-horsepower <b>articulated</b> and tracked <b>tractors.</b> All these tractors were exported under the name [...] "Belarus" [...] but were of a different design to each other.Within the Eastern bloc the tractors had no paint scheme, they were simply painted the same colour all over, red, green and blue being the most common. In the late 1980s Belarus tractors gained a paint livery of cream/white, cream wheels, with a red chassis, this remained until the late 1990s when it changed to red with a black chassis and cream wheels (later silver).A green alternative to the red was available for some markets during the 2000s (decade). While blue with a black chassis is currently the livery for the more basic 2wd cabless models.|$|R
40|$|In North-eastern Italian Alps wood {{extraction}} in steep terrain (up to 25 - 30 %) {{is generally}} performed {{by means of}} 4 WD agricultural tractors equipped with winches. One problem {{associated with the use}} of agricultural tractor in forestry, especially in off-road moving in steep terrain, is the stability and hence operator’s safety. In order to overcome such a problem an adaptation of a 4 WD agricultural tractor for wood extraction in steep terrain has been developed. It considers different features especially designed to be installed on an agricultural tractor. The first feature consists in a self-levelling device, made by two arms, <b>articulated</b> on the <b>tractor’s</b> final drive box and moved by two hydraulic rams. On the end of each arm a free-turning bogie is mounted. Another feature is the elongation of the fork in which the front axle is articulated, in order to increase its tilting angle. Two side plates, bolted on the rear body of the tractor, represent the last feature. The plates allow moving the p. t. o. shaft and the three-point linkage to the back permitting the use of the mounted winch. The control of the levelling device is both automatic and manual. When manually operated the levelling device is controlled by means of a single lever on the right side arm of the operator’s seat. The adapted tractor has demonstrated to operate in efficient and safe way on sloping and rough terrain...|$|R
40|$|Identifying the {{dynamics}} and parameters for an <b>articulated</b> heavy vehicle/driver (<b>tractor</b> semi-trailer/driver) system {{was the main}} objective of this thesis. The dynamic behaviour of the vehicle system was studied by setting up a closed-loop control model of a tractor semi-trailer/driver system that included a three-degree-of-freedom (3 -DOF) tractor semi-trailer lateral dynamic model and a driver steering model. The tractor semi-trailer's lateral displacement, lateral velocity, yaw velocity and yaw angle were viewed as the state vector of the 3 -DOF tractor semi-trailer lateral dynamic model. It was assumed that the driver-steering control model would respond to the state vector following a time delay. The inherent driver-steering parameters to be identified were the state vector's coefficients, here defined as an optimal control vector. The Simulated Annealing (SA) method was used to search this control vector, because the problem of searching optimal control vectors does not fall under classical control theory. When step lateral displacement was introduced, optimal control simulations were performed on the tractor semi-trailer vehicle using its own optimal control vector; this was searched using the SA method. The responses of the tractor semi-trailer vehicle illustrate its dynamic characteristics: these {{can be used to}} enhance the driver's steering performance. Other simulations were also conducted in order to discover optimal steering methods and the tractor semi-trailer's dynamic responses to various velocities, various loads and various human-reaction time delays. Somne crucial control parameters were obtained by comparing the responses made by two different types of tractor semi-trailer vehicles. Lastly, a preview driver model derived from the complex driver model was used to search safe preview distance...|$|R
40|$|When {{introducing}} a new farm tractor in the market, manufacturers undergo a tight homologation path {{under the supervision}} of the OECD centres technicians. Two of the most requested tests, although not mandatory for the commercialization of a tractor, are the individuation of the centre-of-gravity and of the lateral rollover angle on a tilting platform. The results of these tests are very interesting for the technical characterization of a vehicle but still far from its real working conditions, even if the tilting platform test forecasts, for example, the presence of fuel in the tank and the use of some weights to simulate the driver. Indeed, in this last test, no mounted implement (or equivalent mass) is connected to the tractor, hence limiting a lot the use of the results of the described tests. Therefore, a numeric stability simulator was developed to overcome this problem, thus managing the variety of the possible implements to be connected to a tractor and giving the farmers effective indications concerning their vehicles’ safety while working on hillsides. This simulator, based on a Newtonian approach, is able to compute the stability of a vehicle formed by a tractor and an implement. It was used to verify the possibility of safety using some common mounted implements with a compact wheeled <b>articulated</b> <b>tractor,</b> specifically designed to work within terraced orchards/vineyards, common in mountain areas. This tractor was chosen because of its particular architecture: it gives the tractor a higher agility and a shorter turning radius than conventional tractors with the same dimensions, but also a very different stability behaviour, maybe not completely predictable in all situations by inexperienced drivers...|$|E
40|$|A methodological {{approach}} for evaluating a priori {{the stability of}} agricultural vehicles equipped with different mounted implements and operating on sloping hillsides is shown here. It uses a Matlab simulator in its first phase and, subsequently, the Response Surface Modelling (RSM) to evaluate the coefficients {{of a set of}} regression equations able to account for the Type-I and Type-II stability of the whole vehicle (tractor + implement with known dimensions and mass). The regression equations can give reliable punctual numeric estimations of the minimum value of the Roll Stability Index (RSI) and can verify the existence of a Type-I equilibrium without the need of using the simulator or knowing any detail about the model implemented in it. The same equations {{can also be used to}} generate many intuitive graphs (“equilibrium maps”) useful to verify quickly the possible overturning of the vehicle. A case-study concerning a 4 -wheel drive <b>articulated</b> <b>tractor</b> is then presented to show the potential of the approach and how using its tools. The tractor has been studied in three scenarios, differing on where the implement has to be connected to the tractor (1 : frontally; 2 : frontally-laterally; 3 : in the back). After performing a series of simulations, a set of polynomial models (with 6 independent variables) has been created and verified. Then, these models were used, together with the related equilibrium maps, to predict the stability of 8 implements for scenario 1, 7 implements for scenario 2, and 3 implements for scenario 3, evidencing in particular the danger of using a lateral shredder with a mass greater than 245 kg. The proposed approach and its main outcomes (i. e., the regression equations and the equilibrium maps) can give an effective contribution to the preventive safety of the tractor driver, so it could be useful to integrate it in the homologation procedures for every agricultural vehicle and to include the resulting documentation within the tractor logbook...|$|E
