5|$|The {{first two}} novels were {{published}} in 1894 to mixed reviews. Love on <b>a</b> <b>Mortal</b> Lease (title from George Meredith) was released in June, followed in November by The Journey of High Honour, at 30,000words considerably shorter than the 355 pages of Love on <b>a</b> <b>Mortal</b> Lease. Each novel sold {{only a few hundred}} copies. Harwood describes the early work such as Love on <b>a</b> <b>Mortal</b> Lease as showing stylistic similarities to contemporary women novelists such as Craighie and Rhonda Broughton, with witty dialogue in Craighie's style, although he thinks Olivia brought a more serious voice to her work. He describes Love on <b>a</b> <b>Mortal</b> Lease as a work in which the heroine is well-characterised but the background is weak.|$|E
5|$|Tales of love often involve incest, or the {{seduction}} or rape of <b>a</b> <b>mortal</b> woman {{by a male}} god, resulting in heroic offspring. The stories generally suggest that relationships between gods and mortals are something to avoid; even consenting relationships rarely have happy endings. In a few cases, a female divinity mates with <b>a</b> <b>mortal</b> man, as in the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, where the goddess lies with Anchises to produce Aeneas.|$|E

Once again transformed into the handsome young man she had first met the wise man asks the kelpie whether if given the choice it would choose to be a kelpie or <b>a</b> <b>mortal.</b> The kelpie in turn asks the girl whether, if he were a man, she would agree to be his wife. She confirms that she would, after which the kelpie chooses to become <b>a</b> <b>mortal</b> man, and the pair are married.|$|E

He was occasionally capricious, short-tempered or cruel, but his predominant traits were honesty, loyalty and fundamental goodness.|$|E

After leaving, Moore was persuaded to return that afternoon by the urgent pleas of Hamilton's friends, and upon receiving Hamilton's solemn assurance that he repented for his part in the duel, Moore gave him communion. Bishop Moore returned the next morning, stayed with Hamilton for several hours until his death, and conducted the funeral service at Trinity Church.|$|E

The game takes place in Skyrim, a province of the Empire on the continent of Tamriel, amid a civil war between two factions: the Stormcloaks and the Imperial Legion. The player character is a Dragonborn, <b>a</b> <b>mortal</b> born with the soul and power of a dragon.

Despite the eventual recovery of Constantinople in 1261, the Byzantine Empire remained {{only one of several}} small rival states in the area for the final two centuries of its existence. Its remaining territories were progressively annexed by the Ottomans over the 15th century. The Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453 finally ended the Byzantine Empire.|$|E

5|$|A major {{figure in}} Islam, Jesus (commonly transliterated as ʾĪsā) is {{considered}} to be a messenger of God (Allah) and the Messiah (al-Masih) who was sent to guide the Children of Israel (Bani Isra'il) with a new scripture, the Gospel (referred to in Islam as Injil). Muslims regard the gospels of the New Testament as inauthentic, and believe that Jesus' original message was lost or altered and that Muhammad came later to restore it. Belief in Jesus (and all other messengers of God) is a requirement for being a Muslim. The Quran mentions Jesus by name 25 times—more often than Muhammad—and emphasizes that Jesus was <b>a</b> <b>mortal</b> human who, like all other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message. While the Qur'an acknowledges the Virgin birth of Jesus, he {{is considered to}} be neither the incarnation nor the son of God. Islamic texts emphasize a strict notion of monotheism (tawhid) and forbid the association of partners with God, which would be idolatry. Like all prophets in Islam, Jesus is considered a Muslim.|$|E
5|$|Bahuchara Mata is {{a patron}} goddess of the Hirja. In popular {{iconography}} she is often shown riding a rooster {{and carrying a}} sword, trident and a book.

Bahuchara is believed to have originated as <b>a</b> <b>mortal</b> woman who became martyred. In one story, Bahuchara is attacked by a bandit who attempts to rape her, but she takes his sword, cuts off her breasts and dies. In another story, Bahuchara curses her husband when she catches him sneaking to the woods to engage in homoerotic behavior, causing his genitals to fall off and forcing him to dress as a woman.|$|E

5|$|In 1884, Holmes {{published}} a book dedicated to the life and works of his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson. Later biographers would use Holmes's book as an outline for their own studies, but particularly useful was the section dedicated to Emerson's poetry, into which Holmes had particular insight. Beginning in January 1885, Holmes's third and last novel, <b>A</b> <b>Mortal</b> Antipathy, was published serially in The Atlantic Monthly. Later that year, Holmes contributed $10 to Walt Whitman, {{though he did not}} approve of his poetry, and convinced friend John Greenleaf Whittier to do the same. A friend of Whitman, a lawyer named Thomas Donaldson, had requested monetary donations from several authors to purchase a horse and buggy for Whitman who, in his old age, was becoming a shut-in.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{is shown}} to be {{as he would have}} been high up in the mountains, as <b>a</b> <b>mortal</b> and imperilled man. While this seems in some way demeaning to Napoleon's figure (and {{contrasts}} in the extreme with David's version, which shows Napoleon impervious to the cold, and in a heroic light), Delaroche's artwork was not intended to portray him in a hostile or unbecoming way. Delaroche wanted to depict Napoleon as a credible man, who suffered and underwent human hardship too, on his most daring exploits, and felt that making him appear as he really {{would have been in the}} situation would by no means debase or diminish Napoleon's iconic status or legacy, but rather make him a more admirable person.|$|E
5|$|Peckham {{was very}} strict in his interpretations of canon law, and once wrote to Queen Eleanor that {{her use of}} loans from Jewish moneylenders to acquire lands was usury and <b>a</b> <b>mortal</b> sin. He also felt that Welsh laws were illogical and {{conflicted}} with Biblical teachings. He also mandated that the clerical tonsure worn by the clergy should not just include {{the top of the}} head, but also have the nape and over the ears shaved, which allowed the clergy to be easily distinguished from the laity. To help with this, the archbishop also forbade the clergy from wearing secular clothing, especially military garb. He also forbade an effort by the Benedictine order in England to reform their monastic rule, to allow more time for study and for more education for the monks. Peckham's reason was that they were against custom, but he may also have had concerns that these reforms would have drawn recruits away from the Franciscans.|$|E
