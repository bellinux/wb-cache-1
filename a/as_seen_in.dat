5|$|Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem is a third-person action-adventure game. The single-player {{campaign}} {{is composed of}} 15 missions and features the Predator from the film. The player has access to Predator weapons <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> movies and other sources in the franchise, including claws and a shoulder-mounted energy cannon. New weapons from the corresponding film include an energy pistol.|$|E
5|$|Although {{conclusive}} evidence might be wanting either way for whether Hebrew Law allowed for impalement, or just hanging, the Neo-Assyrian method of impalement <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the carvings could, perhaps, equally {{easily be seen}} as a form of hanging upon a pole, rather than focusing upon the stake's actual penetration of the body.|$|E
5|$|Although skull {{proportions}} varied, abelisaurid skulls {{were generally}} very tall and very short in length. In Carnotaurus, for example, the skull {{was nearly as}} tall as it was long. The premaxilla in abelisaurids was very tall, so {{the front of the}} snout was blunt, not tapered <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> many other theropods.|$|E

5|$|During the Weimar Republic, the black-red-gold colours {{were the}} colours of the democratic, centrist, and republican {{political}} parties, <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> {{the name of}} Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold, formed {{by members of the}} Social Democratic, the Centre, and the Democratic parties to defend the republic against extremists on the right and left.|$|E
5|$|Once Ganesha was {{accepted}} {{as one of the}} five principal deities of Brahmanism, some Brahmins chose Ganesha as their principal deity. They developed the Ganapatya tradition, <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the Ganesha Purana and the Mudgala Purana.|$|E
50|$|In {{regard to}} the {{category}} of mood, in Leco one uses suffixes like -kama power, -bibi almost, among others, to indicate a possible event, <b>as</b> is <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> (9). Leco has, besides, two forms of imperative of the second person, one directed to only one person and another directed to various persons, <b>as</b> is <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> (10a) and (10b).|$|R

5|$|Texas {{has made}} a strong mark on {{national}} and international pop culture. The state is strongly associated {{with the image of}} the cowboy shown in westerns and in country western music. The state's numerous oil tycoons are also a popular pop culture topic <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the hit TV series Dallas.|$|E
5|$|The {{contact angle}} (θ), <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> Figure 1, is the angle {{at which the}} liquid–vapor {{interface}} meets the solid-liquid interface. The contact angle {{is determined by the}} result between adhesive and cohesive forces. As the tendency of a drop to spread out over a flat, solid surface increases, the contact angle decreases. Thus, the contact angle provides an inverse measure of wettability.|$|E
5|$|The film shows Luttrell (Wahlberg) {{being able}} to walk after the Taliban's ambush on the four-man SEAL team. In reality, Luttrell {{explained}} that his legs were numb immediately after the ambush, and when feeling did return to them, the pain from the shrapnel in his legs made it too painful to walk; he had to crawl seven miles looking for water and sanctuary. Luttrell {{also said that he}} did not witness the MH-47 Chinook helicopter being shot down, <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the film. At the end of the film, the Pashtun villagers fight off a Taliban attack in a firefight that never actually happened. In reality, the Taliban fighters were outnumbered by the villagers and had no intentions of attacking the village. They did, however, try to sneak in and capture Luttrell in secret. Luttrell also did not go into cardiac arrest after he was rescued, nor was he near death, <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the film.|$|E

5|$|The {{reason for}} this is that the {{pressure}} difference across a fluid interface is proportional to the mean curvature, <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the Young–Laplace equation. For an open soap film, the pressure difference is zero, hence the mean curvature is zero, and minimal surfaces have the property of zero mean curvature.|$|E
5|$|The temple {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} examples of the Nagara style of Hindu temple architecture that emphasises vertical structure, <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> subsequent temples like Mukteshvara, Lingaraj and Rajarani in Bhubaneswar and the Sun Temple at Konark.|$|E
