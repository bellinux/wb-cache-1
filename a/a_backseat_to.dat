Canada's National Post saw structural similarities in the stage to the alien craft in War of the Worlds, stating the concert [...] "was as if the band had descended to colonize the stadium with their message of intergalactic hope", and that the space theme meant [...] "When you can play music with someone who's in space, the idea goes, you're shrinking our corner of the universe down to size." [...] The Washington Post stated that the visual display made the band seem invincible, but that the performance was more of an [...] "orgy of light and sound" [...] than a rock concert. In contrast, The Boston Globe complained that the stage's size caused the band to struggle to connect with the audience and play with intimacy, as all four members were often playing to a different section of the stadium.|$|E

50|$|The entire {{album is}} written in quasi-diary form, as each song chronicles the {{obstacles}} the band faced after Age of Electric. The track “Wrapped in Cellophane” describes the musical and personal metamorphosis that the band members experienced {{in the months before}} recording the album. Musically, the album pays homage to the bands that inspired Static in Stereo, such as The Rolling Stones, The Clash, and Kiss. The different musical style of each band member is present throughout the album. Elements of punk, glam rock, country and rock ‘n’ roll can be heard in the musical arrangements of the instruments and vocals. Hard driving guitar and heavy bass are present in most of the tracks. Although the music has a gritty, loud, hard rock sound similar to late metal or grunge, it plays <b>a</b> <b>backseat</b> role <b>to</b> the vocals in both primacy and depth. The sentimentality and honesty of the lyrics allow for the listener to connect with the music, at the same time satisfying the rock ‘n’ roll criteria.|$|R

[...] Lenka Křivánková of Masaryk University wrote in her thesis [...] "1990s Hollywood Break-Away Hits: A Feminist Perspective" [...] that she was not particularly surprised by the film's lack of strong roles for women because of its Shakespearean source material, dubbing the film [...] "an old traditional fairy tale with all its traditional features", including patriarchy and monarchism. Writing for the University of Waterloo's Kinema, Vicky Wong believes that Nala reinforces the film's [...] "take your place" [...] motif, reminding main character Simba of his responsibilities.

500|$|Keenan {{rejoined the}} {{sessions}} in early 2003, {{and the music}} began taking a different direction with the new lineup and Keenan's influence. Beyond the new personnel, the dynamic had changed: With Mer de Noms, Howerdel had already written and finalized all of the music, with Keenan just contributing the lyrics and vocals. This time around, Keenan was more active in vetoing or altering musical ideas, determined to make something different than just another hard rock album, in fear of it being redundant. Sessions became tense, with Howerdel preferring the heavier compositions written while waiting for Keenan {{to return to the}} band, and sometimes taking offense to Keenan's suggested mellower rearrangements. White would play the role of a mediator between the two; being newer to the band helped him provide an outsider's perspective, helping them to find a common ground. The band released their second album, Thirteenth Step, on September 16, 2003. The album debuted even higher than Mer de Noms, charting at number 2 in its opening week and selling over 233,000 copies. [...] The album, and its accompanying new sound, fared well critically as well. The AllMusic review praised the bands new sound, describing it as [...] "moodier, tenser, and more atmospheric (if that is possible) recording than its predecessor...The wide dynamic swathes that were so prominent on the band's debut are all but absent here. The squalling guitars have taken <b>a</b> <b>backseat</b> <b>to</b> carefully crafted melodies where atmospherics are maximized and pulled taut over the listener. While not a radical departure from Mer de Noms, there is a real progression here.... Lyrically, musically, sonically, the Thirteenth Step is proof positive that mainstream rock has plenty of life and vision left in it." ...|$|E

[...] Michael Hann of the United Kingdom-based Guardian was impressed by the concert, praising the setlist and deeming it enjoyable for both children and adults. He continued, [...] "Good as the best songs are, though, they take <b>a</b> <b>backseat</b> <b>to</b> the staging [...] The one misstep is when a trailer for her next movie is shown during a costume change. It's a tacky moment and doesn't reflect the attention to detail that makes the rest of it a laugh-out-loud delight." [...] Lael Loewenstein of Variety magazine said, [...] "Cyrus knows how to deliver the goods without losing her core audience." [...] Loewenstein deemed the concert a mission accomplished because of inevitable hits and Cyrus' charisma, drive, spunk, and a merely-limited vocal range.

With this history in mind, this issue of Footprint sought to open the discussion on what might be offered by the less familiar branches of epistemology and logic that are more prevalent and developed in the analytic tradition. The papers brought together here are situated {{in the context of}} a discipline in transformation that seeks a fundamental approach to its own tools, logic and approaches. In this realm, the approaches of logic and epistemology help to define an alternate means of criticality not subjected to personalities or the specialist knowledge of individual philosophies. Rather the various articles attempt to demonstrate that such difference of background assumptions is a common human habit and that some of the techniques of analytic philosophy may help to leap these chasms. The hope is that this is a start of a larger conversation in architecture theory that has as of yet not begun.  </p...|$|R

So it {{is regarded as a}} promising energy utilization facility. The research on hydrodynamic performance of wave capture buoys is the precondition and key to the wave energy device design and optimization. A simplified motion model of the buoys in the waves is established. Based on linear wave theory, the equations of motion of buoys are derived according to Newton’s second law. The factors of wave and buoys structural parameters on wave energy absorption efficiency are discussed in the China’s Bohai Sea with short wave period and small wave height.

Mrs. Maurier shares in the disappointment of unrequited love as she watches all of the men on the boat fawn over Jenny and Pat. These two subjects of male gaze share their own brief sexually charged interaction as they lay together in the room they share. The only openly reciprocal feelings that seem to develop over the course of the day are between Pat and the nervous steward, David West, who she goes to meet for a midnight swim after her intimate encounter with Jenny.
