5000|$|Unlike deodorant, which simply reduces {{axillary}} odor without affecting body functions, antiperspirant reduces both eccrine and apocrine sweating. <b>Antiperspirants,</b> {{which are}} classified as drugs, cause proteins to precipitate and mechanically block eccrine (and sometimes apocrine) sweat ducts. The metal salts found in <b>antiperspirants</b> alters the keratin fibrils in the ducts; the ducts then close and form a [...] "horny plug".

40|$|Background: Urinary Incontinence is {{a common}} symptom among the older and frail older people. Apart from {{affecting}} {{the quality of life}} and skin complications, the demand on assistance could be too high for any sufferer. While conservative means of treatment do not work, special incontinence apparel could be a good compromise. Objective: To create an absorbent, antiseptic, <b>antiperspirant</b> and deodourant diaper for the older and dependent people suffering from urinary incontinence. Material and Methods: <b>Antiperspirant</b> and antiseptic medicinal materials have been reported in Traditional Chinese Medicine and two herbs were screened out to provide the required effects. A combination of Fraxini Cortex, Calamine and Zinc oxide made in powder forms was impregnated into a pocket of the diaper. Laboratory tests were performed to confirm the antiseptic, <b>antiperspirant</b> and deodourant effects of the materials. A self-control clinical trial on the diaper was organized in an elderly home. Results: Antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus, E. coli and Candida were proven. <b>Antiperspirant</b> effects were confirmed using acetylcholinesterase inhibitor testings. Volunteers using the Sudoscan machine further demonstrated the weak <b>antiperspirant</b> effects of the herbs. A pilot study on 31 dependent diaper users gave positive feedbacks of more comfort, less leakage, odour and better skin conditions. The overall satisfaction reached 79 %. Conclusion: A special diaper with antiseptic, <b>antiperspirant</b> and deodourant effects could be created with in-expensive herbal powder impregnated and could be recommended to the older and frail older people with urinary incontinence.

50|$|Aluminium {{chloride}} is used {{in regular}} <b>antiperspirants.</b> However, hyperhidrosis requires solutions or gels with a much higher concentration. These antiperspirant solutions or hyperhidrosis gels are especially effective for treatment of axillary or underarm regions. Normally it takes around {{three to five days}} to see improvement. The most common side-effect is skin irritation. For severe cases of plantar and palmar hyperhidrosis, there has been some success with conservative measures such as higher strength aluminium chloride <b>antiperspirants.</b> Treatment algorithms for hyperhidrosis recommend topical <b>antiperspirants</b> as the first line of therapy for hyperhidrosis.

General methods used to evaluate staining potential, and deodorant and <b>antiperspirant</b> efficacy of these products are re-viewed.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{formulation}} factors on {{the efficacy of}} the <b>antiperspirant</b> agent, aluminum chlorhydrate, was studied. The formulation variables include the various carrier vehicles for the topically applied active ingredient. Quantification of <b>antiperspirant</b> efficiency was evaluated by a generally accepted gravimetric technique by application of a known amount of active ingredient to the axillae of human volunteers. Aluminum chlorhydrate was solubilized in a cream base, an aqueous lotion, and a hydroalcholic base, and was suspended in a solid stick. Aluminum chlorhydroxy allantoinate was incorporated into all vehicles for its therapeutic and cosmetic properties. All test <b>antiperspirant</b> products were {{selected on the basis of}} cosmetic elegance and acceptability.
