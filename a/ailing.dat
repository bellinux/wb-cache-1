40|$|<b>Ail</b> is a 17 -kDa protein of Yersinia enterocolitica {{previously}} {{identified on}} the basis of its ability to confer upon Escherichia coli the phenotype of attachment and invasion of cultured epithelial cells. Here we report an examination of the contribution of <b>ail</b> to the pathogenicity of Y. enterocolitica. A low-copy-number <b>ail</b> plasmid that promoted serum resistance in E. coli HB 101 was constructed. The serum resistance phenotype conferred by <b>ail</b> to E. coli was affected by the growth phase of the culture as well as by the gene copy number. In contrast, the copy number of <b>ail</b> (and the relative quantity of <b>Ail)</b> was found to have little effect on the amount of Ail-promoted invasion of cultured epithelial cells. An <b>ail</b> mutant of Y. enterocolitica was constructed and characterized in vitro. This mutant produced no detectable <b>Ail</b> and had a reduced ability to invade CHO cells. Serum resistance of Y. enterocolitica was <b>Ail</b> dependent and was affected by growth phase and <b>ail</b> copy number. The phenotype of the <b>ail</b> mutant was examined in vivo by using a murine model for infection. The <b>ail</b> mutant phenotype was identical to that of the wild-type strain in oral 50 % lethal dose studies and early colonization of Peyer's patches as well as in kinetic studies. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis of <b>Ail</b> produced by bacteria growing in vivo at 48 h postinfection indicated that <b>ail</b> was expressed at this time point. Thus, our findings confirm that <b>Ail</b> contributes to the serum resistance and invasion phenotypes of Y. enterocolitica in vitro and indicate that <b>Ail</b> is not required to establish an infection or to cause systemic infection of BALB/c or DBA/ 2 mice...|$|R
40|$|The Yersinia pestis adhesin <b>Ail</b> mediates {{host cell}} binding and {{facilitates}} delivery of cytotoxic Yop proteins. <b>Ail</b> from Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis is identical {{except for one}} or two amino acids at positions 43 and 126 depending on the Y. pseudotuberculosis strain. <b>Ail</b> from Y. pseudotuberculosis strain YPIII has been reported to lack host cell binding ability, thus we sought to determine which amino acid difference(s) are responsible for the difference in cell adhesion. Y. pseudotuberculosis YPIII <b>Ail</b> expressed in Escherichia coli bound host cells, albeit at ~ 50 % the capacity of Y. pestis <b>Ail.</b> Y. pestis <b>Ail</b> single mutants, Ail-E 43 D and Ail-F 126 V, both have decreased adhesion and invasion in E. coli when compared to wild-type Y. pestis <b>Ail.</b> Y. pseudotuberculosis YPIII <b>Ail</b> also had decreased binding to the <b>Ail</b> substrate fibronectin, relative to Y. pestis <b>Ail</b> in E. coli. When expressed in Y. pestis, there was a 30 - 50 % decrease in adhesion and invasion depending on the substitution. Ail-mediated Yop delivery by both Y. pestis <b>Ail</b> and Y. pseudotuberculosis <b>Ail</b> were similar when expressed in Y. pestis, with only Ail-F 126 V giving a statistically significant reduction in Yop delivery of 25 %. In contrast to results in E. coli and Y. pestis, expression of <b>Ail</b> in Y. pseudotuberculosis led to no measurable adhesion or invasion, suggesting the longer LPS of Y. pseudotuberculosis interferes with <b>Ail</b> cell-binding activity. Thus, host context affects the binding activities of <b>Ail</b> and both Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis <b>Ail</b> can mediate cell binding, cell invasion and facilitate Yop delivery...|$|R

40|$|Adhesion to host {{cells and}} {{delivery}} of cytotoxic Yops are essential steps in the infection process of the plague pathogen Yersinia pestis. The Y. pestis adhesin <b>Ail</b> was recently demonstrated to mediate host cell binding and be critical for Yop delivery and virulence. Thus, the goal of my thesis was to identify a host cell substrate with which <b>Ail</b> interacts and elucidate the mechanism by which <b>Ail</b> engages host cells. To identify <b>Ail</b> ligands, the <b>Ail</b> protein was purified following overexpression in E. coli and reconstituted in detergent micelles. Purified <b>Ail</b> bound specifically to fibronectin (Fn), an extracellular matrix protein that may act as a bridge between <b>Ail</b> and the host cell. Fibronectin is a large, complex molecule with many known binding domains. We demonstrated <b>Ail</b> binds to host Fn specifically and this Ail-Fn interaction is important for efficient delivery of Yops. Thus, I sought to understand this interaction in more detail. I wanted to identify the <b>Ail</b> binding site along fibronectin and also to identify the amino acids of <b>Ail</b> that are important for host cell binding and Yop delivery. <b>Ail</b> binds the 120 kDa fragment, but less effectively than full-length Fn. Antibody studies provided additional evidence that <b>Ail</b> binds the 8 - 9 FNIII modules within the 120 kDa fragment. However, inhibitor {{studies suggest that the}} Ail-binding site may include a neighboring 45 kDa fragment. Together, these data suggest there may be two sites within fibronectin that are required for optimal <b>Ail</b> binding, the collagen/gelatin binding domain in the N-terminal half of fibronectin and the 8 - 9 FNIII modules within the 120 kDa cell binding domain more C-terminally located. To study residues that contribute to the various functions of <b>Ail,</b> we used a mutagenesis scheme termed SWIM (selection without isolation of mutants). We found a serine and a phenylalanine in the third exposed loop of <b>Ail</b> that are defective for cell binding and Yop delivery when substituted with alanine. The double S 128 A/F 130 A mutant is modestly defective for Fn binding and Yop delivery. Together, my thesis work has contributed to the understanding of how Y. pestis <b>Ail</b> uses fibronectin to engage host cells and lead to virulence functions...|$|R

METHODS: Ten human cadaver knees were dissected excluding knees with surgical scars. Fifty-one MR examinations were performed in symptomatic patients. Arthroscopic observations were carried out on ten patients. RESULTS: <b>AIL</b> was found in nine dissected knees with type I insertion in six cases, type II insertion in three cases. The average length was 31. 2 mm (25 - 45 mm). The average distance between <b>AIL</b> and insertion of the anterior cruciate ligament was 12 mm (11 - 15 mm). Concerning MR study, <b>AIL</b> was found in 34 cases (82. 9 %). Four (9. 75 %) ruptures of the <b>AIL</b> were encountered. Where <b>AIL</b> was intact, 14 patients presented meniscal lesions (46. 6 %). Where <b>AIL</b> was ruptured, three patients presented meniscal lesions (75 %). CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates through anatomical and MR studies that <b>AIL</b> is present in more than 80 % of the cases with predominant type I insertion. The association of meniscal and <b>AIL</b> lesions was highlighted demonstrating that <b>AIL</b> is not only an anatomical point of interest but also a clinical and surgical reality...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ail</b> is a 17 -kDa outer {{membrane}} Yersinia {{protein that}} mediates bacterial attachment to, and invasion of, cultured epithelial cells. We report here an alternative role for <b>Ail</b> in {{the pathogenesis of}} Yersinia infection. We found that Escherichia coli HB 101 harboring the 4 -kilobase recombinant <b>ail</b> clone pVM 102 were highly resistant to killing in up to 50 % normal human serum. A 674 -base-pair fragment of DNA from pVM 102, which encodes the <b>ail</b> gene, was inserted into pUC 18 and shown to promote full resistance to complement killing in E. coli HB 101. Cellular attachment and resistance to complement killing in a plasmid-cured inv- strain of Yersinia enterocolitica (0 : 8) was correlated with the thermoinduced expression of <b>Ail</b> at 37 degrees C. Insertional inactivation of <b>ail</b> in Y. enterocolitica resulted in loss of both thermoinduced bacterial properties. Cellular attachment and serum resistance were restored by complementation of the defect by plasmid-encoded <b>ail.</b> Complementation of cell attachment activity required bacterial growth at 37 degrees C, indicating that an additional thermoinduced factor is required for this <b>Ail</b> function. In addition, these studies reveal that functional homology exists between <b>Ail</b> and the structurally related protein Rck, which promotes resistance to complement killing in Salmonella typhimurium...|$|R
