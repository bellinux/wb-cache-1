50|$|Annunciators are logical Management Instruments {{that are}} used to {{interface}} with an <b>alarm</b> <b>display</b> function on a hardware platform. Because a wide variety of <b>alarm</b> <b>display</b> hardware, such as LEDs, audible alerts, text display panels, etc. are used on different hardware platforms, it is difficult for an application program to be written to display alarm information in a platform-independent way. The HPI Annunciator Management Instrument provides an abstract interface to communicate alarm information to the HPI implementation or underlying management infrastructure, which can then take the appropriate actions to display that information on a particular platform.|$|E

50|$|A mature hog deer stag stands about 70 cm at the {{shoulder}} and weighs approximately 50 kg while hinds are much smaller, standing about 61 cm and weighing {{in the vicinity of}} 30 kg. They are very solidly built with a long body and relatively short legs and the line of the back slopes upward from {{the shoulder}}s to a high rump. The ears are rounded; older animals tend to become light coloured in the face and neck.The Indian Hog Deer's coat is quite thick and generally a uniform dark-brown in winter except for the underparts of the body and legs which are lighter in colour. During late spring, the change to a summer coat of rich reddish brown commences although this may vary between individuals. Many hog deer show a dark dorsal stripe extending from the head down {{the back of the neck}} and along the spine. In summer, there is usually a uniform row of light-coloured spots along either side of the dorsal stripe from the shoulders to the rump. The tail is fairly short and brown but tipped with white. The underside of the tail is white and the deer can fan the white hairs out in a distinctive <b>alarm</b> <b>display.</b>|$|E

40|$|The LHC alarm service, LASER, is {{the alarm}} tool {{used by the}} {{operators}} for the accelerators and the technical services at CERN. To ensure that the <b>alarms</b> <b>displayed</b> are known and understood by the operators, each alarm should go through a well-defined procedure from its definition to being accepted in operation. In this paper we describe the workflow to define alarms for the technical services at CERN. We describe the different stages of the workflow like equipment definition, alarm information specification, control system configuration, test, and final acceptance in operation. We also describe the tools available to support each stage and the actors involved. Although {{the use of a}} strict workflow will limit the number of alarms that arrive to LASER and ensure that they are useful for operations, for a large complex like CERN there are still potentially many <b>alarms</b> <b>displayed</b> at one time.

2500|$|Just as the {{evolutionary}} arms race {{has led to}} the development of pursuit behavior of predators, so too has it led to the anti-predator adaptations of prey. <b>Alarm</b> <b>displays</b> such as eastern swamphen's tail flicking, white-tailed deer's tail flagging, and [...] Thomson's gazelles' stotting have been observed deterring pursuit. These tactic are believed to signal that a predator's presence is known and, therefore, pursuit will be much more difficult. These displays are more frequent when predators are at an intermediate distance away. <b>Alarm</b> <b>displays</b> are used more often when prey believe predators are more prone to change their decision to pursue. For instance, cheetahs, common predators of Thomson's gazelles, are less likely to change their choice to pursue. As such, gazelles stott less when cheetahs are present than when other predators are present. In addition to behavioral adaptations, there are also morphological anti-predator adaptations to pursuit predators. For example, many birds have evolved rump feathers that fall off with much less force than the feathers of their other body parts. This allows for easier escape from predator birds, as avian predators often approach prey from their rump.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{thesis is}} concerned with the human factors aspects of industrial alarm systems within human supervisory control tasks. Typically such systems are located in central control rooms, and the information may be presented via visual display units. The thesis develops a human, rather than engineering, centred approach to the assessment, measurement and analysis of the situation. A human factors methodology was employed to investigate the human requirements through: interviews, questionnaires, observation and controlled experiments. Based on the analysis of current industrial alarm systems in a variety of domains (power generation, manufacturing and coronary care), it is suggested that often designers do not pay due considerations to the human requirements. It is suggested that most alarm systems have severe shortcomings in human factors terms. The interviews, questionnaire and observations led to the proposal of 'alarm initiated activities' as a framework for the research to proceed. The framework comprises of six main stages: observe, accept, analyse, investigate, correct and monitor. This framework served as a basis for laboratory research into alarm media. Under consideration were speech-based <b>alarm</b> <b>displays</b> and visual <b>alarm</b> <b>displays.</b> Non-speech auditory displays were the subject of a literature review. The findings suggest that care needs to be taken when selecting the alarm media. Ideally it should be chosen to support the task requirements of the operator, rather than being arbitrarily assigned. It was also indicated that there may be some interference between the alarm initiated activities and the alarm media, i. e. information that supports one particular stage of alarm handling may interfere with another...|$|R

We discuss the term 'alarm', and suggest that different alarm situations will have different information requirements. Thus, a single type of <b>alarm</b> <b>display</b> may not be suitable for the complete range of situations encountered in the control room. We investigated the use of speech for different 'alarm-initiated actions': recording, urgency rating, location identification, and action specification. These tasks varied in terms of difficulty, and this affected performance. We also varied the quality of speech, comparing synthesized with human speech. While speech quality affected performance on the recording task, we found that task difficulty interacted with speech quality on the other tasks. This means that definable 'trade-offs' exist between the use of speech and the situation in which it is to be used...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of review: We outline {{and discuss}} recent work on {{auditory}} displays, covering both auditory alarms that indicate technical or physiological threshold levels and informative auditory displays {{that provide a}} continuous awareness of a patient 2 ̆ 7 s well being. Recent findings: The struggle to make auditory alarms informative proceeds with work on two fronts. In one approach, researchers are developing and evaluating auditory <b>alarm</b> <b>displays</b> to indicate the source and urgency of off-normal states and are relying on the emergence of smart software algorithms to reduce the false-positive rate. In a complementary approach, other researchers are providing information about the patient 2 ̆ 7 s well being in normal as well as abnormal states, generalizing the advantages of variable-tone pulse oximetry to other systems and other auditory display formats. In either approach, a multidisciplinary team is essential {{in the design and}} evaluation of auditory displays. Because informative auditory displays may subtly change clinical practice, there are repercussions for training. Summary: Auditory display in anesthesia can extend well beyond auditory <b>alarms</b> to <b>displays</b> that give the anesthesiologist a continuous peripheral awareness of patient well being.

40|$|I {{investigated}} visual signals mediated through {{displays and}} postures and their importance in communication in Red-vented Bulbul Pycnonotus cafer. Observations revealed that this species used five types (namely mate acquisition display, greeting display, <b>alarm</b> <b>display,</b> crest position and begging display) of visual signals for communication and showed {{three types of}} sleeping postures and broken-wing display. Mate acquisition display was performed to maintain pair bond and when two individuals met, {{one of them would}} use greeting display along with low amplitude complex vocalisations. The position of the crest seemed to vary with different behavioural contexts; it was raised erect in alarm and recumbent during greeting. Nestlings/ fledglings used specific begging displays that included gaping with or without vocal signals. The presence of a predator in close vicinity of bird/nesting site, elicited alarm displays along with alarm calls. The present study revealed that the displays and postures are important means of communication under various social contexts and were often accompanied with vocalisations thus making them multi-component. It is believed that the multi-component signals provide more reliable information for receivers and increase the efficacy of communication...|$|E

A circadian rhythm is defined as any biological operation that reveals an endogenous, entrainable oscillation for 24  h.

It was assumed that the seizures occur while the patient is sleeping. The false <b>alarms</b> <b>display</b> a circadian dependency with most of the seizure prediction algorithms. The seizure predectability is increased during night due to the large number of seizures. Accordingly, threshold adaptation can be used in day and night to enhance predictability. The authors evaluated this method utilizing iEEG data from eight patients and a total of 1400  h, which include 172 seizures and reported a good prediction performance for 40 % of the patients.|$|R
