The model includes the effects of intersymbol interference (ISI), tunneling current, <b>avalanche</b> <b>noise,</b> and its correlation with the stochastic avalanche duration, as well as dead space. A minimum receiver sensitivity of - 28 dBm is predicted at an optimal width of 0. 18 mu m and an optimal gain of approximately 13, for a 10 Gb/s communication system, assuming a Johnson noise level of 629 noise electrons per bit. The interplay among the factors controlling the optimum sensitivity is confirmed. Results show that for a given transmission speed, as the device width decreases below an optimum value, increased tunneling current outweighs <b>avalanche</b> <b>noise</b> reduction due to dead space, resulting in an increase in receiver sensitivity.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} photon flux density on the noise {{properties}} of optically illuminated Double Drift Region (DDR) Mixed Tunneling Avalanche Transit Time (MITATT) device is investigated in this paper. An analytical model is proposed {{to obtain a}} relationship between the normalized difference of electron and hole current density of DDR device and the incident photon flux on it. Simulation is carried out to study the small signal noise spectral density and noise measure of the device under optical illumination. Two illumination configurations i. e., Flip Chip (FC) and Top Mounted (TM) structures are considered in the simulation. The device is designed to operate at mm-wave window frequency at W-band.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the measurement and interpretation of <b>avalanche</b> <b>noise</b> in avalanche photodiodes (APDs). The design of a measurement system with a higher signal to noise ratio than previous systems reported in the published literature is described. The system uses phase sensitive recovery techniques, which allow the <b>avalanche</b> <b>noise</b> power and photocurrent to be measured unambiguously from the system noise and leakage current of the device under test. Using the measurement system described, <b>avalanche</b> <b>noise</b> measurements have been performed on a range of homojunction GaAs p"+-i-n"+ and n"+-i-p"+ diodes with 'i' region widths, w, from 2. 61 #mu#m to 0. 05 #mu#m, and on a range of homojunction InP p"+-i-n"+ diodes with widths, w, ranging from 2. 40 #mu#m to 0. 24 #mu#m. The results show that, for w #<=# 1 #mu#m, the dependence of excess noise factor F on multiplication does not follow the continuous noise model of McIntyre, which has become well established since its publication in 1966. Instead, a decreasing noise factor is observed as w decreases for a constant multiplication. This reduction in F occurs for both electron and hole initiated multiplication in the thinner w structures even though the ionisation coefficient ratio is close to unity. These results suggest that, in GaAs and in InP, if a thin multiplication region is used it is not always necessary for the greatest ionising carrier type to initiate multiplication for the lowest <b>avalanche</b> <b>noise.</b> To interpret the measurements, a model is used that includes the effect of dead space; the minimum distance a carrier must travel to gain the ionisation threshold energy. The dead space is found to be increasingly important in these thinner structures and restricts carriers to ionising {{in the latter half of}} their transit of the high field. This restriction makes the probability distribution function for the ionisation path length more deterministic and, in turn, reduces the overall unpredictability in the multiplication process, leading to a lower excess noise. The effect of distributed carrier generation, and so of mixed injection, in a 0. 1 #mu#m avalanche region is also investigated experimentally and using a model including dead space. These results show that the noise produced from mixed injection is lower than predicted by McIntyre's model, but higher than that obtained with pure electron or hole injection due to the effect of dead space.

The model includes the effects of intersymbol interference (ISI), tunnelling current, <b>avalanche</b> <b>noise,</b> as well as dead space. The sensitivity of InP, InA 1 As and InAs avalanche photodiodes (APDs) were investigated. The interplay among the factors controlling the optimum sensitivity is confirmed. Results show that for a given transmission speed, as the device width decreases below the optimum value, increased tunnelling current outweighs <b>avalanche</b> <b>noise</b> reduction due to dead space, resulting in poorer receiver sensitivity. As the device width increases above its optimum value, the receiver sensitivity worsens as bandwidth decreases, causing TST to dominate <b>avalanche</b> <b>noise</b> and tunnelling current. For a 10 Gb/s system and a bit-error rate of 10. 12, an optimum w of 0. 191 lm is predicted, yielding an optimum sensitivity of - 28. 1 dBm at an M of 13 for InP APDs. InAIAs APDs were found to provide an improvement of 0. 5 dBm over InP at an M of 15 and w of 0. 15 Ilm. InAs APDs have been calculated to yield an optimum sensitivity between - 29. 6 and - 30. 2 dBm at an M of 76 and w of 4. 2 Ilm. A type-II InGaAs/GaAsSb superlattice p-i-n diode and separate absorption and multiplication (SAM) APD using TnAlAs as the multiplication region (both lattice- matched to InP) is reported. Optical and electrical characterisations of the devices are performed. The devices exhibited a cut-off wavelength of 2. 511 m. Unity-gain responsivities of 0. 53 A/W and 0. 47 A/W have been obtained for the p-i-n diode and APD, respectively, when illuminated with 2. 004 f. lm wavelength light. Detectivity at this wavelength was calculated to be 7. 1 x 10 Y cmHzY'l/W for the p-i-n diode and 5. 9 x I O~ cmHz'f,/W for the APD. Excess noise measurements conducted on the APD show that the characteristics follow that of an In AlAs p-i-n diode with the same multiplication layer thickness, giving an effective k of 0. 2.
