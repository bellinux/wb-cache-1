5|$|Uropathogenic E. coli {{from the}} gut {{is the cause}} of 80–85% of community-acquired urinary tract infections, with Staphylococcus saprophyticus being the cause in 5–10%. Rarely they may be due to viral or fungal infections. Healthcare-associated urinary tract infections (mostly related to urinary catheterization) involve <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>broader</b> range of {{pathogens}} including: E. coli (27%), Klebsiella (11%), Pseudomonas (11%), the fungal pathogen Candida albicans (9%), and Enterococcus (7%) among others. Urinary tract infections due to Staphylococcus aureus typically occur secondary to blood-borne infections. Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium can infect the urethra but not the bladder. These infections are usually classified as a urethritis rather than urinary tract infection.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{originating}} {{theories on}} the entrepreneur and spatial economics, Cantillon {{also provided a}} dedicated theory on population growth. Unlike William Petty, who believed there always existed {{a considerable amount of}} unused land and economic opportunity to support economic growth, Cantillon theorised that population grows only {{as long as there are}} economic opportunities present. Specifically, Cantillon cited three determining variables for population size: natural resources, technology, and culture. Therefore, populations grow only as far as the three aforementioned variables allowed. Furthermore, Cantillon's population theory was more modern than that of Malthus in the sense that Cantillon recognised <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>broader</b> category of factors which affect population growth, including the tendency for population growth to fall to zero as a society becomes more industrialised.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, renowned British mammalogist Oldfield Thomas {{described}} Oryzomys wavrini as a {{new species}} of Oryzomys from Paraguay. In the next decades, it was viewed as an aberrant species of Oryzomys (then used in <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>broader</b> sense than now), but it was moved to a separate genus, named Pseudoryzomys, by Hershkovitz in 1959, who noted that although it is similar to Oryzomys palustris in appearance, other features suggest it is {{more closely related to}} Phyllotis. Thus, he viewed the animal {{as a member of the}} phyllotine group of rodents, which includes Calomys and Phyllotis, not of the oryzomyine group, which includes Oryzomys, and his opinion was mostly accepted in the next few decades. Scientific knowledge of the rare Pseudoryzomys wavrini—only three specimens were known when Hershkovitz described the genus Pseudoryzomys in 1959—increased in the following years, and in 1975 the Bolivian population was named as a separate subspecies, Pseudoryzomys wavrini reigi, because Bolivian animals are slightly larger and darker than those from Paraguay.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{alternative}} approach {{for the analysis}} and the numerical approximation of ODEs, using a variational framework, is presented. It {{is based on the}} natural and elementary idea of minimizing the residual of the differential equation measured in a usual Lp norm. Typical existence results for Cauchy problems can thus be recovered, and finer sets of assumptions for existence are made explicit. We treat, in particular, the cases of an explicit ODE and a differential inclusion. This approach also allows for a whole strategy to approximate numerically the solution. It is briefly indicated here as it will be pursued systematically and in <b>a</b> <b>much</b> more <b>broad</b> fashion in a subsequent paper...|$|R
40|$|Shirasu porous glass (SPG) {{membrane}} emulsification {{has many}} advantages over traditional emulsification methods of stirring, ultrasoubd, and homogenization. The main advantages are much improved uniform size {{distribution of the}} droplets and lower mechanical shear stress. This paper examines the uniformity and stability of sunflower oil emulsions prepared by SPG membrane. The effects of emulsifiers on the uniformity and stability of emulsions were investigated. Results showed that emulsions stabilized by Tween 20 are generally more uniform and stable compared to those stabilized by Tween 60. Emulsions prepared by membrane emulsification showed excellent uniformity and stability with no droplet size change after 6 -months storage, while those prepared by the homogenizer have <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>broad</b> size distribution and are unstable after 7 days of storage with significant further broadening of the droplet size distribution by coalescence and Oswald ripening. Uniform-sized sunflower O/W emulsions prepared by the SPG membrane also have good thermal stability when subjected to either freezing or heating. The mechanical stability of sunflower O/W emulsions prepared by the SPG membrane can be further improved by adding thickeners to the aqueous phase. Therefore, SPG membrane emulsification is a promising method for preparing uniform and stable emulsions, which will have good potential applications in the food industry, in terms of improving shelf life and product quality. © 2008 American Chemical Society...|$|R
