It is a potent Î±2-adrenergic receptor antagonist with ~10x the strength of the related compound mianserin and has also been shown to act as a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist and H1 receptor inverse agonist, while having no significant effects on the reuptake of serotonin or norepinephrine. Based on its pharmacological profile, <b>aptazapine</b> may be classified as a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA).|$|E
