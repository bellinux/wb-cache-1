McConnell records that the party were unanimous in their desire to remain with the ship that had effected their rescue, but Bartlett ordered them aboard Bear. Before returning to Alaska, Bear made a final attempt to reach Herald Island; ice limited their approach to , <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> no signs of life. The reunited party arrived at Nome on 13 September, to a great welcome from the local population.|$|E
5|$|Meråker saw in {{industrial}} boom {{due to the}} railway. There was already a copper mine and smelters at Kopperå, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> the railway as a possibility to change from locally produced charcoal to imported coke. A pulp mill opened in 1887, but burned down in 1912. The most important industry was the carbide factory that opened in Kopperå in 1900—Meraker Smelteverk. Though located close to the hydroelectricity sources in Meråker, the import and export of raw and finished materials {{would not have been}} possible without the railway. A port for the plant was built at Muruvik in 1918.|$|E
5|$|On 8 October 1996, 7 {{months after}} the {{escalation}} over Imia a Greek Mirage 2000 reportedly fired an R.550 Magic II missile and shot down a Turkish F-16D over the Aegean Sea. The Turkish pilot died, while the co-pilot ejected and was rescued by Greek forces. In August 2012, after the downing of a RF-4E on the Syrian Coast, Turkish Defence Minister İsmet Yılmaz confirmed that the Turkish F-16D was shot down by a Greek Mirage 2000 with an R.550 Magic II in 1996 after violating Greek airspace near Chios island. Greece denies that the F-16 was shot down. Both Mirage 2000 pilots reported that the F-16 caught fire <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> one parachute.|$|E

25|$|In {{this matter}} Sternhell distinguishes two {{schools of thought}} in Zionism. One was the liberal or {{utilitarian}} school of Theodor Herzl and Max Nordau. Especially after the Dreyfus Affair, they held that anti-Semitism would never disappear <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> Zionism as a rational solution for Jewish individuals.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, {{with the}} railway system maturing, Collins went to {{management}} looking for {{funding for a}} project to develop a black-and-white version of the code for other industries. They declined, saying that the railway project was large enough, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> no need to branch out so quickly.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, king Mohammed VI of Morocco {{approved}} the Royal Institute of the Amazigh Culture (IRCAM) Berber Institute's decision of using neo-Tifinagh {{as the sole}} official alphabet for the Berber language in Morocco.

25|$|Once {{they reach}} the coordinates, an alien {{possesses}} Yuki's body and explains that the Gamilas and Iskandar are two aspects of the same race. The alien says their planet is dying <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> Earth as the most suitable replacement, after first killing off humanity. Iskandar {{did not agree with}} this and was imprisoned. Iskandar implants in Yuki the ability to clean the radiation from Earth. As she and Kodai return to the Yamato, Saito and Sanada sacrifice themselves by destroying the Gamilas power source. The Yamato returns to Earth, where Okita dies. The crew rejoices at their return home, but a surviving Gamilas ship ambushes them and severely damages the warship. Dessla now appears and says they no longer wish to invade the Earth; however, since the majority of the Gamilas were killed, he intends to destroy the planet with his ship to avenge his race. Kodai orders the surviving crew to abandon ship before he pilots the Yamato on a kamikaze attack against Dessler's ship. He fires the blocked Wave Motion Cannon, which destroys both spaceships.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to the polls, the UMP lost ground, but it {{maintained}} a workable majority. The Socialists unexpectedly gained seats. Their plea to voters {{to prevent an}} overwhelming UMP dominance of the legislature appears to have paid off, providing the Socialists {{with a measure of}} redemption from the election loss. UDF splinter groups, François Bayrou's MoDem and the New Centre, contested their first elections. MoDem won 4 seats (including Mayotte regionalist Abdoulatifou Aly), while the New Centre was able to form a parliamentary group, with 22 seats. It {{remains to be seen whether}} Bayrou's party, which polled the third highest vote (7.61% in round one), will develop into a major political force. Their result is an improvement on the UDF's result of 4.9% in 2002. The National Front (FN) polled its lowest vote since its splash onto the political scene in 1986. The FN lost more than 60% of its support base since 2002. Support for the Communist Party also declined, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> a loss of several seats, whilst several other left-wing parties won nine new seats. The Greens gained one new seat, despite a fall in their vote. One of the most stunning results was the surprise defeat of UMP party leader Alain Juppé by the Socialist Party candidate Michèle Delaunay. Culture Minister Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres was defeated as well losing to Socialist Party candidate Jean-Patrick Gille. The far right did not win any seats.|$|E

25|$|England's innings {{was more}} solid than Australia's - {{the first seven}} batsmen made 21 and three passed 50 - but fell 15 runs short in the first innings. Geoff Pullar (33) and David Sheppard (31) {{struggled}} along with Sheppard edging a ball to the ground near Alan Davidson and Pullar caught by Richie Benaud only for Barry Jarman to signal that it wasn't a chance. Benaud had both men floundering at times, but they stuck to their work until Benaud caught Pullar off his own bowling on 62/1 and had Sheppard taken round the corner by Garth McKenzie for 65/2. This brought Ted Dexter and Colin Cowdrey the crease to see out the session. After tea Dexter sent the ball crashing to the boundary ten times {{as he and his}} vice-captain added 80 runs in 76 minutes. Cowdrey (21) was willing to watch until he hooked Bobby Simpson straight into the hands of Bill Lawry and at ten to six Dexter's confidence - and the lengthening shadows - got the better of him and he drove over a ball from Benaud and was bowled for 70. Alan Smith joined Ken Barrington as a nightwatchman <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> the day end on 169/4. Barrington thrashed six boundaries off Benaud and Simpson (1/52) in his first 25 runs the next day, adding 51 with Smith (21), who was caught behind when Garth McKenzie was brought into the attack and made several balls left awkwardly off the pitch. Barrington now reverted to his typical, grinding self, taking 210 minutes over his last 40 runs with Peter Parfitt feeling his way to 80 off 244 minutes. Finally the Surrey batsman lost his concentration and skied Benaud to Peter Burge at mid-off for 78 and was replaced by the equally pedestrian Fred Titmus, who prodded his way to 21 in 104 minutes. The end came suddenly, Titmus and Parfitt were caught off Benaud (6/115), McKenzie (3/78) had Barry Knight out for a duck and Fred Trueman for 19 after he hit a six and 2 fours adding 27 runs in 20 minutes for the last wicket with Brian Statham as 361/6 became 362/9 and 389 all out.|$|E
500|$|The Floriana Lines (...) are {{a line of}} fortifications in Floriana, Malta, which {{surround}} the fortifications of Valletta and form the capital city's outer defences. Construction of the lines began in 1636 and they were named after the military engineer who designed them, Pietro Paolo Floriani. The Floriana Lines were modified {{throughout the course of}} the 17th and 18th centuries, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> use during the French blockade of 1798–1800. Today, the fortifications are still largely intact but rather dilapidated and in need of restoration.|$|E
500|$|Rudolf Wolters (August 3, 1903– January 7, 1983) was a German {{architect}} and government official, {{known for his}} longtime association with fellow {{architect and}} Third Reich official Albert Speer. [...] A friend and subordinate of Speer, Wolters received the many papers which were smuggled out of Spandau Prison for Speer while he was imprisoned there, and kept them for him until Speer was released in 1966. [...] After Speer's release, the friendship slowly collapsed, Wolters objecting strongly to Speer's blaming of Hitler and other Nazis for the Jewish Holocaust and World War II, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> nothing {{of each other in}} the decade before Speer's death in 1981.|$|E

500|$|Kehoe's {{neighbor}} Sidney J. Howell {{testified that}} after the fire began, Kehoe warned him and three boys to leave the farm, saying [...] "Boys, you are my friends, you {{better get out of}} here, you better go down to the school." [...] Three telephone linemen working near Bath testified that Kehoe passed them on the road toward the school, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> him arrive there. He swerved his truck and {{stopped in front of the}} building. In the next instant, according to the linemen, the truck blew up, and one of them was struck by shrapnel. [...] Other witnesses testified that Kehoe paused after stopping and called Superintendent Huyck over before blowing up his truck.|$|E
500|$|On July 20 at the Little Sandy River, most of {{the wagon}} train opted to follow the {{established}} trail via Fort Hall. [...] A smaller group opted to head for Fort Bridger and needed a leader. [...] Most of the younger males in the group were European immigrants and {{not considered to be}} ideal leaders. James F. Reed had been living in the U.S. for a considerable time, was older, and had military experience, but his autocratic attitude had rubbed many in the party the wrong way, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> him as aristocratic, imperious, and ostentatious. [...] By comparison, the mature, experienced, American-born Donner's peaceful and charitable nature made him the group's first choice. The members of the party were comfortably well off by contemporaneous standards. Although they are called pioneers, all but a few lacked specific skills and experience for traveling through mountains and arid land, and had little knowledge about how to interact with Native Americans.|$|E
500|$|Kelly {{began his}} {{professional}} career for the Victoria Bees of the Class-B Northwestern League in 1914 and 1915. During the 1915 season, he {{was purchased by}} the New York Giants from Victoria for $1,200 (equal to [...] today). The Giants were rebuilding their team, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> Kelly as a possible replacement for Fred Merkle. However, he played sparingly for the Giants in his first MLB seasons, appearing in only 17 games in 1915 and 49 games in 1916. He was selected off waivers by the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 25, 1917 to back up Honus Wagner, but did not hit sufficiently. The Pirates waived Kelly, and he was reclaimed by the Giants from the Pirates on August 4, 1917. The Giants optioned Kelly to the Rochester Hustlers of the Class-AA International League, where he played {{the rest of the}} 1917 season. Kelly did not play professionally in 1918 due to his military service. The Giants sold Kelly to Rochester before the 1919 season to acquire Earl Smith.|$|E
