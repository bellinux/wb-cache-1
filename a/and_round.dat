In some cases the conquistadores would round up the elders, chain them up, whip them and set their war dogs upon them, in order to force the natives to hand over tribute such as food and clothing.|$|E

5|$|Military {{architecture}} was {{the supreme}} {{expression of the}} Ayyubid period, {{as well as an}} eagerness to fortify the restoration of Sunni Islam, especially in a previously Shia-dominated Egypt by constructing Sunni madrasas. The most radical change Saladin implemented in Egypt was the enclosure of Cairo and al-Fustat within one city wall. Some of the techniques of fortification were learned from the Crusaders, such as curtain walls following the natural topography. Many were also inherited from the Fatimids like machicolations <b>and</b> <b>round</b> towers, while other techniques were developed simultaneously by the Ayyubids, particularly concentric planning.|$|E

5|$|As Revenge was {{the nearest}} {{of the three}} pirate vessels to the Americans, Allen ordered Alligator boats lowered to run inshore and attack her. Some 40 men armed with small arms were put into the boats, with Allen {{personally}} taking command of the launch, Lieutenant Dale the cutter, and midshipman Henley the gig. Revenge was already underway {{by the time it}} was sighted and attempted to escape the Americans despite the lack of wind, using its sweeps. After the American boats had rowed about , the pirate schooner made an about-face and raised a red flag. Upon approaching the pirates, the American craft were fired on with both grape <b>and</b> <b>round</b> shot. The American boats returned fire with small arms and moved in to board the vessel. Rather than try to fight off the boarding attempt, the pirates abandoned Revenge while another schooner covered their escape. Alligator gig manned by Henley and four men was sent off to take Revenge as a prize.|$|E

5|$|By 1528, Spanish {{colonial power}} had been {{established}} in the Chiapas Highlands, and encomienda rights were being issued to individual conquistadores. Spanish dominion extended from the upper drainage of the Grijalva, across Comitán and Teopisca to the Ocosingo valley.

5|$|Denmark's first churches {{from the}} 9th century were built of timber {{and have not}} survived. Hundreds of stone churches in the Romanesque style {{were built in the}} 12th and 13th centuries.

Granite {{boulders}} and limestone were initially the preferred building materials, but after brick production reached Denmark {{in the middle of the}} 12th century, brick quickly became the material of choice. Among the finest examples of brick Romanesque buildings are St. Bendt's Church in Ringsted (c. 1170) and the unique Church of Our Lady in Kalundborg (c. 1200) with its five tall towers.|$|E
