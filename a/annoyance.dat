5|$|Early in this film, Denham {{shoots a}} scene for his film in which Ann, in-character, proclaims she's {{never been on}} a ship before, and Bruce Baxter improvises lines proclaiming <b>annoyance.</b> The {{dialogue}} they exchange is taken verbatim from early scenes between Ann and Jack Driscoll in the 1933 film.

40|$|Despite the {{explosion}} of research on goal pursuit, relatively {{little is known about}} the shaping of goal progress by the simple experiences that characterize everyday life. Two literatures furnish competing predictions about the relationship between pleasant daily experiences (simple pleasures), unpleasant daily experiences (small <b>annoyances),</b> and day-to-day goal progress. A 6 -day experience-sampling study revealed support for the favored integrative account. On a given day, a relatively high number of simple pleasures offset the negative relationship between the number of small <b>annoyances</b> and goal progress through a restoration of daily happiness rather than a reduction of daily stress. This study highlights the bright side of pleasurable experiences, indicating that goal progress can flourish in a life punctuated with frequent simple pleasures because they help offset daily irritations. As natural precursors to positive and negative affect, simple pleasures and small <b>annoyances</b> could be powerful predictors of important consumer outcomes. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

5|$|Garfield {{thought the}} land grants given to {{expanding}} railroads was an unjust practice.

5|$|It was {{becoming}} clear that federal intervention {{was required to}} settle the dispute, despite the general policy of the Grant administration {{to stay out of}} the affairs of Southern states.

Grant and the United States Attorney General, George Henry Williams, issued a joint communique supporting Baxter and ordering Brooks to vacate the capitol. They also referred the dispute back to the State Legislature.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of outsiders {{such as the}} Strangers and the Particulars was a considerable <b>annoyance</b> to the Pilgrims.

Furthermore, a group of Strangers founded the nearby settlement of Wessagussett and the Pilgrims were highly strained, both emotionally {{and in terms of}} resources, by their lack of discipline. They looked at the eventual failure of the Wessagussett settlement as Divine Providence against a sinful people.|$|E
