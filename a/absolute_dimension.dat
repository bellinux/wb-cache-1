In 31 patients with an isolated lesion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, regional myocardial perfusion was determined from thallium- 201 scans recorded in the left anterior oblique projection after symptom-limited treadmill exercise. Thallium- 201 uptake in the distribution of the left anterior descending coronary artery was expressed as a ratio of thallium- 201 uptake in the left circumflex artery distribution. Percent area stenosis, minimal cross-sectional area and mean diameter of each stenotic lesion were measured by computer-assisted cinevideodensitometric analysis of projected coronary arteriograms digitized in a 512 × 512 pixel matrix with 256 gray levels. Thallium- 201 uptake in the left anterior descending coronary artery distribution, expressed as a ratio, correlated poorly (r = 0. 65) with relative percent stenosis, but correlated significantly (r = 0. 83; p 1.

40|$|In {{a socialist}} {{enterprise}} managed in a non-parametric and a non-instructive manner, the regulation system appears {{also in a}} parametric manner. They are composed, according to A. Wakar's terminology, {{of a number of}} regulation junctions. The first element of ithese junctions are usually analyses, i. e. labour indices or regulators of supply equipped in certain patterns (the reference bases). Great difficulties arise in the selection of these bases, as each kind, apart from a positive effect has a negative effect, {{from the point of view}} of Centrum, on the strategy and tactics of socialist enterprises. In the light of an analysis of the types of bases in application, it has been postulated that instead of the analysers in the regulation junctions, synthetic recorder should be introduced. Such a recorder does not possess a pattern. However as the synthetic recorders are a resultant dimension (takings minus costs), their <b>absolute</b> <b>dimension</b> permits evaluation of the activity of the enterprise.

40|$|Time gets {{much less}} {{attention}} than space {{in discussions of}} archaeological scale. This may seem strange in a primarily historical discipline for which the demonstration of human antiquity {{is something of a}} defining moment (Grayson, 1983). Part of the reason may lie in the nature of time. Time unfolds along a continuum, and the way observers perceive time depends on their location and the scales they adopt. Compare the contemporary Western experience of earth time, for example, with time at the scale of the universe. A person traveling {{at the speed of light}} would experience a different time (Hawking, 1998; Ramenofsky, 1998) than the person caught up in the linear progression of our planet-bound life. Of course, archaeologists rarely deal with quantum time, but the example serves to remind us that time is not an <b>absolute</b> <b>dimension.</b> Archaeologists create their own conceptual units for measuring time. They project these units at different scales and choose their own observation points, dividing the continuum of time into arbitrary packages that relate in some way to specific research goals (Ramenofsky, 1998). [...] . While the archaeological record may potentially be viewed at a variety of different scales from a range of different view points, issues of compatibility between data, analysis and interpretation cannot be ignored. We begin with this point, using it as the basis for a critique of the recent and current hunter-gatherer literature and drawing on our current work from western New South Wales, Australia, and southwest Wyoming, USA. We argue that neither of the current interpretative approaches to the hunter-gatherer archaeological record, ethnoarchaeological models or insights derived from behavioral ecology, deal adequately with the temporality of the record. Integrating the temporality of data and interpretation suggests to us a third way, whereby we can use explanations developed by viewing the archaeological record at a variety of scales to create a rich historical tapestry of past human behavioral variability...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is twofold. First, we {{investigate}} spaces defined by asserting that their nowhere dense subsets have certain properties. Secondly, we develop some techniques {{for the construction of}} topological spaces. We consider spaces where the nowhere dense sets are asserted to have some property P, calling such spaces boundary-P. We show that if there are no Lusin spaces then every compact boundary-metrizable space is metrizable. Boundary-separability is also studied and we show that if there are no L-spaces then every boundary-separable space is separable. By adapting the <b>absolute</b> <b>dimension</b> function of Arhangel'skii, we define the new concept of cohesion. We show that every compact cohesive and every Hausdorff, sequential cohesive space is scattered. However, we construct regular, crowded spaces of all finite cohesions though there are no regular spaces of transfinite cohesion. We consider too the preservation of cohesion under various mappings and under the formation of products. Turning to construction, we consider the class of compact monotonically normal spaces. It is well-known that it contains the class of spaces which are the continuous images of compact ordered spaces but it is still open as to whether they are actually distinct classes. Using Watson's resolutions, we give a method for constructing monotonically normal spaces. Though this also preserves continuous images of arcs, we show that it is because of a powerful result of Cornette rather than any trivial observation. We also examine more closely monotone normality in images of compact ordered spaces using the Collins-Roscoe structuring mechanism. From this, we extract a strong instance of the mechanism, linear chain (F), which is held by all images of ordered compacta and all proto-metrizable spaces and implies Junnila's concept of utter normality. Elementary submodels are an important tool in the construction of topological spaces. We develop a general method for applying them in varying circumstances and illustrate it by constructing three examples: Balogh's Q-set space, Rudin's normal but not collectionwise Hausdorff space and Balogh's small Dowker space. </p...|$|E

From the light curve analysis of 40 yr of photometry and {{the analysis of}} HERMES spectra, we find radii of 5. 41 ± 0. 04 R☉ and 4. 29 ± 0. 05 R☉, and temperatures of 30, 000 ± 500 K and 25, 750 ± 435 K, respectively. We find that our disentangled component spectra for V 578 Mon agree well with previous spectral disentangling from the literature. We also reconfirm the previous spectroscopic orbit of V 578 Mon finding that masses of 14. 54 ± 0. 08 M☉ and 10. 29 ± 0. 06 M☉ are fully compatible with the new analysis. We compare the <b>absolute</b> <b>dimensions</b> to the rotating models of the Geneva and Utrecht groups and the models of the Granada group.

40|$|The {{following}} note is {{a supplement}} to [1]. We will maintain the notation of [1] throughout, and all numbered items to which we refer are from that paper. Theorem 6. 11 states that if M is a finitely generated R-module then Th(M, F) is stable. As pointed out in Remark 6. 12, the proof Theorem 6. 11 yields a stronger conclusion: Th(M, F) is superstable. These notes consist of detailed arguments for this strengthening. We wish to extend our notion of dimension for exponential F-sets (Definition 6. 6) to arbitrary groupless F-sets. First of all, we point out that δ-dimension (unlike δ-degree) does not really depend on δ. Lemma 0. 1. Suppose M is a finitely generated R-module, δ> 0 is a multiple of δM, and S ∈ ExpM (δ). Suppose δ ′> 0 is another multiple of δM and S ∈ ExpM (δ ′). Then dimδ S = dimδ ′ S. Proof. Working instead with δ ′ δ, it suffices {{to deal with the}} case when δ ′ is a multiple of δ. Write S = F B a where a is a tuple from M and B is a δ-closed set. Then B is also δ ′-closed (see Remark 3. 2). Now dimδ S is the Morley rank of [B]a computed in (N, 0, σ, Pδ), while dimδ ′ S is the Morley rank of [B]a computed in (N, 0, σ, Pδ ′). But these coincide. Indeed, both structures are of Morley rank 1 (Proposition A. 1 and the bi-interpretation given by Proposition A. 2), so that Morley rank is given by algebraic dimension. From quantifier elimination for these structures (again by Proposition A. 1 and the bi-interpretation given by Proposition A. 2), it follows that algebraic closure in (N, 0, σ, Pδ) is the same as algebraic closure in (N, 0, σ, Pδ ′). Thus, algebraic dimensions agree, and therefore, also Morley ranks. � Lemma 0. 1 allows us to define an <b>absolute</b> <b>dimension</b> for exponential F-sets: Definition 0. 2.

40|$|The thesis {{argues that}} the ideological content of C. G. Jung's concept of synchronicity and {{particularly}} Jung's method of presenting synchronicity from 1928 - 1961 prefigure aspects of Michel Foucault's postmodern thought. Part 1 discusses issues of theory and method. Part 2 analyzes the various asides which Jung makes about synchronicity from 1928 - 1951, prior to his three formal works about synchronicity: "On Synchronicity" (1951); The Interpretation of Nature and the Psyche (with Wolfgang Pauli, 1952); and Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle (1952). Part 3 analyzes these formal works about synchronicity, as well as Jung's comments on synchronicity from 1953 {{to the time of}} his death in 1961. The primary method of Parts 2 and 3 is Michel Foucault's discourse analysis, as outlined in The Archaeology of Knowledge (1972). Part 4 critically compares Jung's concept of synchronicity to Foucault's later understanding of discourse theory, as described in Power/Knowledge (1972). This comparison explores the truth claims forwarded by each theorist among the analytical categories of knowledge, power, and subjectivity. I conclude that the concept of synchronicity and Jung's presentation of synchronicity prefigure a postmodern approach to theory and practice. Jung and Foucault both posit the ideas of (1) an intimate connection between the internal image and the external world (2) acausality and discontinuity (3) the relativity of truth, and (4) the fallacy of "objectivity. " But Jung's contradictory belief in a transhistorical, <b>absolute</b> <b>dimension</b> to the self differs from Foucault's view that subjectivity is relative to the social discourses and discursive practices which create it. I also infer that Jung purposely legitimizes synchronicity with a postmodern style of argumentation because he is aware of the need to implement a "new" truth in an unreceptive social environment. The idea of the relativity of space and time which is explicit to synchronicity is not widespread and, in fact, quite foreign to the weltanschauung of the early to middle twentieth century [...] particularly in Jung's field of medicine. Regarding the heuristic value of synchronicity, several theorists use the concept to advance ideas about (1) the paranormal and (2) an anticipated paradigm shift of global consciousness, characterized by beliefs about the relativity of space and time and particularly by the idea that all thoughts, actions, and objects are essentially interconnected...|$|E
