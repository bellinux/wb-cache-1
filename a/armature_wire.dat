50|$|Sculptures {{can have}} glass beads and wire added before curing to provide {{additional}} detailing. Artists may also use <b>armature</b> <b>wire</b> to support their sculptures. Aluminum foil {{can be used to}} support large areas, where the foil is scrunched into a shape and then layered with Fimo. It is also possible to use glass objects as a base structure point to build up from.|$|E
5000|$|Figure D. shows field flux and {{armature}} flux being about equal. The {{result is that}} the center of flux in the gap between the pole face plate and the armature has shifted. For a more detailed dawing, see Richardson. [...] Figure E. shows compensation wires in the field pole face plate that are carrying current opposed to the current in the <b>armature</b> <b>wire</b> adjacent to the gap. The flux in the gap has been restored to the same condition as the case where there is no {{armature flux}}. Even though the armature wires are next to wires carrying current in the opposite direction, the wires of the armature still experience magnetic force from interaction with the field flux.|$|E
5000|$|Prosthetic {{designer}} Howard Berger {{was interviewed}} for the [...] "Making Of Preacher: The Possibilities" [...] segment and {{spoke of the}} creation of the van sequence, which primarily involved practical prosthetic's, though also incorporated some VFX. Berger went on to describe more specifically the usage of such practical prosthetic's, [...] "These green screen gloves and leggings we'll put that on and Yusef and we'll get them dressed and we've got these body parts and we're going to attach them with Velcro underneath their costumes ... For Fiore, who's gonna have a compound fracture, we'll green screen his leg ...." [...] Berger continued by detailing the process at which the prosthetic's are used, to which he stated, [...] "They're just slip latex skins backed with polyfoam, it's like a two part a and b that you mix together and it foams up."Berger also mentioned, [...] "Soft polyfoam that's been tinted red and their <b>armature</b> <b>wire</b> running through it so we can position it". Make-up artist Mike Smithson of KNB EFX was also interviewed for the [...] "Making Of Preacher: “The Possibilities”" [...] segment, with him noting, [...] "Most of these body parts will be under clothing, but the carnage and trauma we're going to end up dressing." [...] For the intricate scene of Cassidy running DeBlanc and Fiore over with the church van, 12 costumes, two dummies, three stunt doubles, {{and a great deal of}} prosthetics were involved.|$|E
50|$|The {{electrical}} energy efficiency of a motor {{can be improved}} by reducing the electrical losses in the coil (e.g., by using materials with higher electrical conductivities). <b>Armature</b> <b>wiring</b> is made from copper or aluminum. Copper <b>armature</b> <b>wiring</b> enhances electrical efficiencies due to its higher electrical conductivity. Aluminum <b>armature</b> <b>wiring</b> is lighter and less expensive than copper.|$|R
40|$|The DC motor {{illustrated}} in this demonstration uses a DC voltage on a coil that rotates in {{a magnetic field}} provided {{by a group of}} magnets, as shown in Figure 1. The magnetic force on the <b>armature</b> <b>wires,</b> which carry a current perpendicular to the magnetic field lines of the permanent magnets, provides the torque that rotates the motor, as demonstrated in the video. A commutator, shown in detail in the video, reverses the current in the coil each half-turn of its rotation...|$|R
50|$|The game's {{creatures and}} mythological {{characters}} were constructed by animation expert Alan Friswell, using the stop-motion techniques made {{popular in the}} films of Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen. The figures were made of modelling clay and latex rubber, over an <b>armature</b> of <b>wire</b> and ball-and-socket joints. The models were then moved incrementally, while being filmed one frame at a time.|$|R
50|$|Moulds for {{glass fibre}} bodies {{were made from}} bodies first made and {{finished}} in aluminium, but the first Lister-Jaguar was made by shaping a chicken <b>wire</b> <b>armature</b> on the actual chassis.|$|R
50|$|Deep Blue Sea {{is made of}} Australian {{wool felt}} on a <b>wire</b> <b>armature</b> and {{features}} 26 carved natural precious opals set amidst swaying feathers. The felt has been hand blocked into cups representing coral polyps.|$|R
5000|$|Stop motion has {{occasionally}} {{been used}} to create the characters for computer games, {{as an alternative to}} CGI. The Virgin Interactive Entertainment Mythos game Magic and Mayhem (1998) featured creatures built by stop motion specialist Alan Friswell, who made the miniature figures from modelling clay and latex rubber, over <b>armatures</b> of <b>wire</b> and ball-and-socket joints. The models were then animated one frame at a time, and incorporated into the CGI elements of the game through digital photography. [...] "ClayFighter" [...] for the Super NES and The Neverhood for the PC are other examples.|$|R
50|$|Plasticine-like {{materials}} are appealing to animators because the material {{can be used}} with ease: it is mouldable enough to create a character, flexible enough to allow that character to move in many ways, and dense enough to retain its shape easily when combined with a <b>wire</b> <b>armature,</b> and it does not melt under hot studio lighting.|$|R
5000|$|Vincenzo Ragusa (8 July 1841 [...] - [...] 13 March 1927) was an Italian {{sculptor}} {{who lived}} in Meiji period Japan from 1876 - 1882. He introduced European techniques in bronze casting, and new methods of modeling in wood, clay, plaster and <b>wire</b> <b>armatures</b> which exerted {{a significant role in}} the development of the modern Japanese sculptural arts.|$|R
5000|$|Humphrey {{received}} her M.A. at Goddard College, Boston in 1972 and her M.F.A. at York University, Toronto in 1978. In the 1980s she became known for works made with wax, plaster, wood, and <b>wire</b> <b>armatures.</b> These abstract sculptures alluded to and were directly informed by bodily processes {{and the human}} form, “the body’s operating systems, its electrical and mechanical structures.” ...|$|R
50|$|Foam latex {{has also}} seen heavy {{use in the}} field of stop motion animation, being used to form the skin and muscles of many puppets. The {{characters}} in The Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline were made partially of foam latex. It is also used in place of clay in productions such as Celebrity Deathmatch in which the various celebrities who appear to be made of clay are in fact foam latex over <b>wire</b> <b>armature.</b>|$|R
50|$|Once the {{character}} has been selected, the actual design process begins with sketches {{of the proposed}} figure. The next step {{is the creation of}} a clay prototype, but other materials such as wax can also be used for the prototype. This model is made by bending aluminum wires to form the backbone of the figure, known as an <b>armature.</b> The <b>wire</b> form includes the outline of the arms and legs posed in the general stance that the figure will assume. The sculptor then adds clay to the armature to give the basic weight and shape that is desired. The clay may be baked slightly during the prototyping process to harden it. Then, the sculptor uses various tools, such as a wire loop, to carve the clay and shape details on the figure.|$|R
5000|$|Clay {{animation}}, or Plasticine animation (often called claymation, which, however, is a trademarked name), uses figures made of clay or {{a similar}} malleable material to create stop-motion animation. The figures may have an <b>armature</b> or <b>wire</b> frame inside, similar to the related puppet animation (below), that can be manipulated to pose the figures. Alternatively, the figures may be made entirely of clay, in the films of Bruce Bickford, where clay creatures morph {{into a variety of}} different shapes. Examples of clay-animated works include The Gumby Show (US, 1957-1967) Morph shorts (UK, 1977-2000), Wallace and Gromit shorts (UK, as of 1989), Jan Švankmajer's Dimensions of Dialogue (Czechoslovakia, 1982), The Trap Door (UK, 1984). Films include Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, Chicken Run and The Adventures of Mark Twain.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of his fascination, the first Fish Lamps were {{fabricated}} between 1984 and 1986. They employed <b>wire</b> <b>armatures</b> molded into fish shapes, onto which shards of plastic laminate ColorCore are individually glued. Since the creation of the first lamp in 1984, the fish has become a recurrent motif in Gehry's work, most notably in the Fish Sculpture at La Vila Olímpica del Poblenou in Barcelona (1989-92) and Standing Glass Fish for the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden (1986).|$|R
5000|$|Chittock {{experimented with}} a mixed media approach, {{because he wanted}} to create a fresh new look to the show [...] The joint use of painted {{backgrounds}} and stop frame model characters give the show a unique appeal. The puppet characters were constructed using a simple <b>wire</b> <b>armature</b> held together with a brass section socket system. The bodies were made using foam latex with resin cast heads. Replacement mouths were used to create the illusion of speech and facial expression.|$|R
50|$|Using {{reclaimed}} plastic household {{objects as}} her materials, Ganz' recent sculptures depict animals in motion. Ganz collects {{most of her}} working material from dustbins and charity shops, {{and the rest is}} donated by friends and family. Ganz uses various forms of thrown away plastic, from cutlery to sunglasses and baskets, and sorts them into many different colour groups. Then she ties every piece of plastic to a <b>wire</b> <b>armature,</b> until she achieves the shape she first envisioned. Sayaka Ganz’s works range from 18 inches to 8 feet long and the most complicated ones take up to a month to finish and can contain hundreds of pieces.|$|R
5000|$|Fairbanks, the sculptor, {{reported}} that he initially created a sketch followed by small, clay model of the statue before starting on the full-size statue. The clay used on the final statue originated from Illinois. [...] To prepare the full-size statue, an <b>armature</b> using wood, <b>wire</b> mesh, and an iron rod was constructed to keep the statue upright while it was being created. Fairbanks built the statue anatomically (nude) at first, and then moved to add clothing and worked on the extremities {{toward the end of}} his work. The podium in the statue was planned based on Fairbanks' review of common photographs of Lincoln during his presidential campaign.|$|R
5000|$|The Outer Space Men - {{also known}} as the Colorform Aliens - is a group of seven [...] "bendy" [...] action figures (similar to Mattel's Major Matt Mason) {{produced}} by the Colorforms Company in 1968, They were designed by toy inventor Mel Birnkrant. The 3.5" [...] to 7" [...] bendable action figures incorporate a pliable metal <b>wire</b> <b>armature</b> encased in painted soft vinyl bodies with [...] "accordion" [...] joints, just like the aforementioned Major Matt Mason line, with whom The Outer Space Men were initially designed to be utilized. Each fictional character represents an extraterrestrial being from the planets in our Solar System, as well as various places in our galaxy.|$|R
5000|$|Table fan: Basic {{elements}} of a typical table fan include the fan blade, base, <b>armature</b> and lead <b>wires,</b> motor, blade guard, motor housing, oscillator gearbox, and oscillator shaft. The oscillator is a mechanism that moves the fan from side to side. The armature shaft comes out {{on both ends of}} the motor, one end of the shaft is attached to the blade and the other is attached to the oscillator gearbox. The motor case joins to the gearbox to contain the rotor and stator. The oscillator shaft combines to the weighted base and the gearbox. A motor housing covers the oscillator mechanism. The blade guard joins to the motor case for safety.|$|R
40|$|Hat of dull golden {{horsehair}} mesh over wire framework. Cylindrical crown widening to base of horsehair {{constructed in}} a spiral, on <b>wire</b> <b>armature.</b> Side of crown with wide black velvet band with self bow at back. Slightly oval brim of same horsehair set so sides are wider than front or back. Brim slopes slightly from crown to outer rim, with thin wire framework to retain shape. Attached at sides are sprays of artificial flowers and leaves. Underside of brim lined with gathered extremely fine pale chiffon. Crown has inner rigid structure that extends below brim, creating a "support" that rests on wearer's head. Exterior of inner structure lined with black velvet, inner lining of white fabric with "drawstring" center gather. No labels or tags...|$|R
50|$|Fill {{materials}} {{may be used}} on taxidermy specimens {{to correct}} areas of loss. It {{is important that the}} specimen is in stable condition because many fill materials have drawbacks that can further damage the specimen. Fills typically consist of a backing made of inert fabric combined with a resin, starch, or cellulose ether. For example, bird specimens that have been badly damaged by pests may be repaired with a mixture of synthetic fabrics and wheat starch. This mixture is used to infill areas of loss and feathers are replaced where possible with a wheat starch paste adhesive. In addition to infilling, taxidermy specimens may require structural repairs. Small specimens that have experienced loss of a head or appendage, a new <b>wire</b> <b>armature</b> may be inserted into the specimen in order to remount the broken piece. Adhesive can be used to further secure the broken piece to its original body.|$|R
5000|$|On September 23, 2003, the Indiana University School of Medicine {{launched}} a statewide, week-long centennial celebration {{at each of}} its nine campuses. The installation of the glass components of DNA Tower began on September 24, 2003. [...] When the globes were removed from their crates, installation experts and volunteers carefully sorted and organized them. The globes were then attached to the <b>armature</b> by metal <b>wire.</b> [...] A time-lapsed video of the installation is available at Chihuly's official website. On September 30, 2009, the unveiling and dedication of Chihuly's DNA Tower sculpture in the Morris Mills Atrium of the VanNuys Medical Science Building coincided with {{the dedication of the}} new, 128215 sq ft Indiana University's School of Medicine Research II facility on IUPUI's campus. The Research II facility houses the Stark Neurosciences Research Institute, Walther Oncology Center, Indiana Center of Excellence in Biomedical Imaging and the Indiana Center for Biological Microscopy.|$|R
50|$|Four Horsemen Studios {{was granted}} {{the rights to}} produce new action figures based on the OSM characters, marking {{the first time the}} sculptors have {{acquired}} a licensed property to develop on their own. Translucent versions of Waves one and two of this series went on sale as a Comic-Con International exclusive in late July 2010. The new figures are rendered in a smaller 3-3/4 inch 'scale', not using <b>wire</b> <b>armatures,</b> but instead utilizing a proprietary Glyos joint system, and were initially packaged in a simple poly. bag with full-color cardboard header, before switching to a standard blister card package. The characters Astro-Nautilus, Inferno, Metamorpho, and Xodiac were chosen for the debut release. Five hundred of each was produced for the event, and availability was split between Internet sale and on-site purchase at the convention. The set of four sold at a retail price of $40; both venues sold through this exclusive offering completely in about 24 hours.|$|R
500|$|Pip, a {{chipmunk}} who {{can talk}} in the 2D world of Andalasia, loses his ability to communicate through speech {{in the real world}} so he must rely heavily on facial and body gestures. This meant the animators had to display Pip's emotions through performance as well as making him appear like a real chipmunk. The team at Tippett began the process of animating Pip by observing live chipmunks which were filmed in motion from [...] "every conceivable angle", after which they created a photorealistic chipmunk through the use of 3D computer graphics software, Maya and Furrocious. When visual effects supervisor Thomas Schelesny showed the first animation of Pip to director Kevin Lima, he was surprised that he was a looking at a CG character and not reference footage. To enhance facial expressions, the modelers gave Pip eyebrows, which real chipmunks do not have. During the filming of scenes in which Pip appears, a number of ways were used to indicate the physical presence of Pip. On some occasions, a small stuffed chipmunk with a <b>wire</b> <b>armature</b> on the inside was placed in the scene. In other situations, a rod with a small marker on the end or a laser pointer would be used to show the actors and cinematographer where Pip is.|$|R
5000|$|The toy line {{included}} four astronaut action figure characters {{sharing a}} common body molded of a rubber-like material called [...] "Plastizol" [...] (which {{was also used}} in the Mattel [...] "Thing Maker" [...] toy line and [...] "Mister Twister" [...] line of fishing bait). The body was molded over a <b>wire</b> <b>armature,</b> with a separately attached head and a removable space helmet based on early NASA helmets. The wire frame often suffered from metal fatigue, breaking at the elbow, knee, and hip joints, giving the toy a limited life span as a result. The space suit paint adhered poorly to the body molding and often peeled off to reveal the black molding beneath. Each character body was painted in a different color and had a separately modeled head. Matt Mason had a dark brown crew cut and a white space suit, Sgt. Storm had blond hair and a red suit; civilian astronaut Doug Davis had a yellow suit and brown hair; Lt. Jeff Long was African-American, with a blue suit (almost two decades before Guion Bluford became the first American black man to orbit the Earth). Mason figures produced in 1966 are identified by blue straps on the space-suit. These straps were painted black in subsequent production years.|$|R
40|$|Things to Come is a 16 mm film {{produced}} {{as part of}} a gallery exhibition at Site Gallery in Sheffield. Working over a period four weeks Ellard and Johnstone built a large, highly abstract, metal and glass model in the gallery space. Things to Come consists of abstract synchronised movement across and around this model, to create a dynamic play of light, shadow, reflection, parallax, depth, surface and prismatic special-effects. The film is formed predominantly from extreme close-ups and abstract details. These are intercut with extracts from ‘set-piece’ takes, which occured in the gallery in way very similar to short performances and suggest an intense choreographed but ad hoc activity. The model was based on a series of unpublished production photographs of László Moholy-Nagy’s ‘future city’ set designs commissioned for the 1936 science fiction film Things to Come. The production photographs are held in the Moholy-Nagy archive in Ann Arbor. They show an extraordinary make-shift studio set–up, comprised of mirrors, scientific glass, polished steel, and string. These object appear to be suspended within simple but fantastic contraptions, <b>armatures,</b> pulleys, fly <b>wires</b> and a-frames, all of which are manipulated by a team of stage hands. The film sequence Moholy-Nagy produced from his model was never used in the finished film, and is now lost. However this footage has an almost mythological status because it was claimed to be “so rich a visual result that the editor did not dare use it”...|$|R
