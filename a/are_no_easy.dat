2500|$|In his 1965 book, Absurd Drama, Esslin wrote:The Theatre of the Absurd {{attacks the}} {{comfortable}} certainties of religious or political orthodoxy. It aims to shock its audience out of complacency, {{to bring it}} {{face to face with}} the harsh facts of the human situation as these writers see it. But the challenge behind this message is anything but one of despair. It is a challenge to accept the human condition as it is, in all its mystery and absurdity, and to bear it with dignity, nobly, responsibly; precisely [...] there <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>easy</b> solutions to the mysteries of existence, because ultimately man is alone in a meaningless world. The shedding of easy solutions, of comforting illusions, may be painful, but it leaves behind it a sense of freedom and relief. And that is why, in the last resort, the Theatre of the Absurd does not provoke tears of despair but the laughter of liberation.Playwrights commonly associated with the Theatre of the Absurd include Samuel Beckett, Eugène Ionesco, Jean Genet, Harold Pinter, Luigi Pirandello, Tom Stoppard, Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Miguel Mihura, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Fernando Arrabal, Václav Havel, Edward Albee, Malay Roy Choudhury, Tadeusz Różewicz, Sławomir Mrożek, N.F. Simpson and Badal Sarkar.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, Bennett {{wrote the}} first of four books with 'In Search of' in their title, In Search of the Sacred: Anthropology and the Study of Religion, in [...] which he called for a {{combination}} of historical, textual and participant observation research to shed light on how religion is lived as well as on its history and official dogmas. [...] He argued that no researcher is neutral and that we all need to engage in reflexivity to guard against bias and the imposition of a priori presuppositions, so that, as a reviewer commented, [...] "suddenly the act of observation becomes the subject of observation" [...] and [...] "for a teacher like Bennett, his own experience as an ordained minister and missionary, his own experience with the give and take of ecumenical teaching becomes the data of religious thought". [...] "Bennett", Dening continued, [...] "is not independent of all the observations made through centuries of thought", so [...] "there is convergence: library and field, intellect and emotion, thought and experience in the end come together". [...] The book, said this reviewer, helped [...] "to make the exposition of {{more than a hundred years}} of thought on the study of religions lucid and memorable". [...] Alan Race, in another review, described the book as cutting [...] "through a dense thicket, yielding a clear, highly readable survey of how" [...] anthropology and Religious Studies [...] "have interacted and failed to interact", although remarking that it mainly discussed European history. Bennett followed this in 1998 with In Search of Muhammad and in 2001 with In Search of Jesus: Insider and Outsider Images. [...] A. G Noorani describes In Search of Muhammad as [...] "an earnest effort by a devout Christian to understand Muhammad, and places" [...] Bennett [...] "in the ranks of others whose services Minou Reeves [...] acknowledges in her survey of Western writing on Muhammad." [...] Commenting on Bennett's discussion of the sources available for the life of Muhammad, Hugh Goddard says that while he is [...] "not as negative" [...] as [...] "some modern Western scholars", neither [...] "is he uncritical of them", suggesting that [...] "some traditions, particularly concerning Muhammad’s miracles and the role of women, should be judged as unreliable." [...] Referring to Bennett's attempt to suggest how [...] "Christ and Muhammad might be viewed as somehow complementary, rather than as rivals" [...] he called this a [...] "brave attempt" [...] even though [...] "there <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>easy</b> answers to such a significant question." [...] Citations include Gerard Rixhon, who says that he makes [...] "words of Bennett's" [...] his [...] "own [...] "when he wrote his searching book on Muhammad" [...] and aimed [...] "to hear Muslim voices." ...|$|E

"Perhaps {{the only}} way, or time, that such {{legislation}} {{could be a}} guide would be if its provisions were identical to the policy at issue, or if in a case involving an as-applied challenge to a policy, the legislative provisions addressed {{every aspect of the}} particular factual setting at issue. Even then, I submit that it would be the reasoning by a court upholding its constitutionality, rather than the legislation itself, that would provide the necessary guidance. I view the use of harassment legislation as an especially inappropriate barometer here because this case is not a harassment case. Rather, it is framed by appellants as a First Amendment speech case. Moreover, it is a school speech case.
