Wide {{range of operation}} is obtained by transforming the phase to be measured into frequency within a constant range started from zero to 360 Hz. A special <b>Astable</b> multivibrator <b>circuit</b> operating in this frequency range is used with a decimal counter to display the phase reading.

The two circuits, which differed slightly in configuration, were evaluated between - 190 and 200 C. The output of each circuit was made to produce a stream of rectangular pulses whose frequency was proportional to the sensed temperature. The preliminary results indicated that both circuits performed relatively well over the entire test temperature range. In addition, after the circuits were subjected to limited thermal cycling over the temperature range of - 190 to 200 C, the performance of either circuit did not experience any significant change...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMetal-oxide {{semiconductor}} gas sensors offer valuable advantages, {{such as high}} sensitivity, {{low cost}} and small dimensions. However, it is well-known that significant problems, such as cross selectivity and lack of long term stability, still affect their performance. Several studies {{point out that the}} modulation of the sensor temperature may improve the sensor performance, and different thermal modulation methods are currently available. In this work a temperature modulation scheme that needs no a priori information about the sample under test is presented. According to this method the sensor temperature value is set, through the sensor resistance value, via an <b>Astable</b> Multi-vibrator <b>Circuit</b> (AMC). The resulting output signal forms a cyclic pattern of pulses. Pulses shape depends on the sensor resistance while the pulse length depends on the measured gas.

40|$|The Setting of a {{single-phase}} motor rotation can {{be performed}} in various ways, such as by adjusting {{the frequency of the}} motor, the voltage, motor resistor or increasing the number of motor poles. By using <b>astable</b> oscillator <b>circuit,</b> setting a single-phase motor rotation frequency parameters can be done by setting the value variabel resistor. Thyristor trigger circuit can be used to control a single-phase motor rotation. Thyristor trigger phase angle changes, caused changes in the frequency, followed by the change of motor rotation.

The generated signals were caused to pass through appropriate electronic circuit compartments to obtain the desired signal waves that produced siren effects. Two unique design methods were tried with success. The first employed the use of transistors and resistors with appropriate capacitor values for their timing constants and presented in <b>astable</b> multivibrator <b>circuit.</b> The second involved the configuration of astable multivibrator into 555 IC timer circuit which produced the same effects with improved frequency.

The amount of electronic components has been minimized in order to reduce production costs. Additional tests were undertaken to determine the ideal tips for soldering, and the adaptations necessary to guarantee self-regulation using a nickel foil shield (due to its low curie temperature) are suggested. The new device contains a resonant inverter able to generate alternating magnetic fields of 100 kHz at the center of an 18 -turn coil; the inverter is controlled only using an <b>astable</b> oscillator <b>circuit.</b> The paper examines criteria to select suitable soldering-tips by experimentally determining their equivalent resistance heating it within the resonant inverter or well, another one by using a rapid magnetic test.

40|$|An ear {{prosthesis}} {{was designed}} in 3 D computer graphics software and fabricated using a 3 D printing process of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) {{for use as}} a hearing aid. In addition, the prosthesis response to pressure and temperature was observed. Pyroelectric and piezoelectric properties of this ear prosthesis were investigated using an <b>astable</b> multivibrator <b>circuit,</b> as changes in PVDF permittivity were observed according to variations of pressure and temperature. The results show that this prosthesis is reliable for use under different conditions of pressure (0 Pa to 16, 350 Pa) and temperature (2 °C to 90 °C). The experimental results show an almost linear and inversely proportional behavior between the stimuli of pressure and temperature with the frequency response. This 3 D-printed ear prosthesis is a promising tool and has a great potentiality in the biomedical engineering field because of its ability to generate an electrical potential proportional to pressure and temperature, and {{it is the first time}} that such a device has been processed by the additive manufacturing process (3 D printing).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{for the first}} time the use of <b>astable</b> multivibrator <b>circuits</b> for computer-less control of solenoid micropumps and application for analytical flow techniques. Triggering and powering were accomplished using the NE 555 integrated circuit. The activation and deactivation time intervals were adjusted using 10 -turn trimmer potentiometers. The potential and characteristics of the instrumentation were studied on a two-channel flow system injecting an indigo carmine indicator solution. Subsequently, a three-channel flow system was assembled and successfully applied to the determination of nitrite in well waters. One circuit was used to control the activation time intervals of three further circuits used for the control of the flow rates or pulsation of solenoid micropumps. These were used for driving carrier, reagent, and sample in an analytical flow system. In the present work, the utility of the circuits for the construction of simple multipumping flow systems was demonstrated. A main feature to be highlighted was the simplicity and very low costs of the controlling circuits, favouring economic and miniaturised flow analysers. Second, no expenses or knowledge are required for the usual software control of the solenoid micropumps. This allows working with every existing detector without considering any problems of software and control compatibility. Third, owing to these features, the proposed assembly is especially suited for simple monitoring analysers, sample provision from an environmental or industrial process, or chemical education.

QM 6 gas sensor {{is used in the}} SEN 1327 module. The output signal from SEN 1327 gas sensor module is used to drive a 555 timer based <b>astable</b> {{multivibrator}} <b>circuit.</b> Here 555 timer works as a tone generator, the frequency of tone can be altered by varying the preset VR 1. The system alerts the user via audio and visual indications. Index Terms- Leakage sensor, 555 timer,sensor modules I. OPEREATION OF THE CIRCUIT he gas leakage alarm circuit operates on a 9 V PP 3 battery. Zener diode ZD 1 is used to convert 9 V into 5 V DC to drive the gas sensor module. A preset in the module is used to set the threshold. Interfacing with the sensor module is done through a 4 -pin SIP header. Whenever there is LPG concentration of 1000 ppm in the area, the OUT pin of the sensor module goes high. This signal drives timer IC 555, which is wired as an astable multivibrator. The multivibrator basically works as a tone generator. Output pin 3 of IC 555 is connected to LED 1 and speaker-driver transistor SL 100 through current-limiting resistors R 5 and R 4, respectively.

40|$|The Anti Collision {{device is}} a {{detection}} device {{meant to be}} incorporated into cars {{for the purpose of}} safety. As opposed to the anti collision devices present in the market today, this system is not designed to control the vehicle. Instead, it serves as an alert in the face of imminent collision. The device is intended {{to find a way to}} implement a minimum spacing for cars in traffic in an affordable way. It would also achieve safety for the passengers of a moving car. The device is made up of an infrared transmitter and receiver. Also incorporated into it is an audio visual alarm to work in with the receiver and effectively alert the driver and/or the passengers. To achieve this design, 555 timers coupled both as <b>astable</b> and monostable <b>circuits</b> were used along with a 38 KHz Square Pulse generator. The device works by sending out streams of infrared radiation and when these rays are seen by the other equipped vehicle, both are meant to take the necessary precaution to avert a collision. The device would still sound an alarm even though it is not receiving infrared beams from the oncoming vehicle. This is due to reflection of its own infrared beams. At the end of the design and testing process, overall system was implemented with a constructed work, tested working and perfectly functional. Comment: 14 pages, 14 figures, Journal pape...|$|R
