40|$|Abstract. A {{telecommunication}} system produces daily {{a large amount}} of alarm data which contains hidden valuable information about the system behavior. The knowledge discovered from alarm data can be used in finding problems in networks and possibly in predicting severe faults. In this paper, we devise a solution procedure for mining sequential alarm patterns from the alarm data of a GSM system. First, by observing the features of the alarm data, we develop operations for data cleaning. Then, we transform the alarm data into a set of alarm sequences. Note that the consecutive <b>alarm</b> <b>events</b> exist in the alarm sequences, and it is complicated to count the occurrence counts of events and extract patterns. Hence, we devise a new procedure to determine the occurrence count of the sequential alarm patterns in accordance with the nature of alarms. By utilizing time constraints to restrict the time difference between two <b>alarm</b> <b>events,</b> we devise a mining algorithm to discover useful sequential alarm patterns. The proposed mining algorithm is implemented and applied to test against a set of real alarm data provided by a cellular phone company. The quality of knowledge discovered is evaluated. The experimental results show that the proposed operations of data cleaning are able to improve the execution of our mining algorithm significantly and the knowledge obtained from the alarm data is very useful from the perspective of network operators for alarm prediction and alarm control. ...|$|E
40|$|Automated {{airborne}} collision-detection {{systems are}} a key enabling technology for facilitat- ing the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into the national airspace. These safety-critical systems must be sensitive enough to provide timely warnings of genuine air- borne collision threats, but not so sensitive as to cause excessive false-alarms. Hence, an accurate characterisation of detection and false alarm sensitivity is essential for understand- ing performance trade-offs, and system designers can exploit this characterisation to help achieve a desired balance in system performance. In this paper we experimentally evaluate a sky-region, image based, aircraft collision detection system {{that is based on}} morphologi- cal and temporal processing techniques. (Note that the examined detection approaches are not suitable for the detection of potential collision threats against a ground clutter back- ground). A novel collection methodology for collecting realistic airborne collision-course target footage in both head-on and tail-chase engagement geometries is described. Under (hazy) blue sky conditions, our proposed system achieved detection ranges greater than 1540 m in 3 flight test cases with no false <b>alarm</b> <b>events</b> in 14. 14 hours of non-target data (under cloudy conditions, the system achieved detection ranges greater than 1170 m in 4 flight test cases with no false <b>alarm</b> <b>events</b> in 6. 63 hours of non-target data).

To support Internet traffic they have built-in redundancy to ensure robustness and quality of service. This requires complex fault management.

In this paper, a generalized maximum likelihood energy detection (GML-ED) ranging method is proposed and implemented. It offers low complexity and can be applied in various environments. An error model is firstly introduced for TOA accuracy evaluation, by which the optimal integration interval can be determined. Aiming to suppress the significant error introduced by the false <b>alarm</b> <b>events,</b> multiple pulses are utilized for accuracy promotion {{at the cost of}} extra energy consumption. For this reason, an energy efficiency model is also proposed based on the transmitted pulse number. The tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency is discussed.
