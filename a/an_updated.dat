40|$|We {{develop a}} general {{framework}} of rule based database {{update on the}} basis of prioritized logic programs. This approach has advantages in representing and handling information conflict in updates. We then focus on the computational aspect of this approach. We show that under our framework, the model checking in <b>an</b> <b>update</b> is co-NPcomplete, while the associated inference problem is Π P 2 -complete. From a practical viewpoint, we propose two strategies to simplify <b>an</b> <b>update</b> specification so that under some conditions, solving <b>an</b> <b>update</b> problem can be based on solving some smaller components of the original problem. Our experimental result shows that these strategies indeed significantly reduce the time cost of evaluating <b>an</b> <b>update</b> specification. Key words: knowledge representation, intelligent databases, automated problem solving 1 Introduction The rule based database update addresses the following problem: given a database and <b>a</b> set of <b>update</b> rules, what is the result [...] ...|$|R

30|$|Note {{that since}} φ̂ is <b>an</b> <b>update</b> rule, the strong ∗ time {{consistency}} implies strong time {{consistency in the}} sense of Definition 7.

40|$|Abstract. Many {{software}} maintenance problems {{are caused by}} using text editors to change programs. A more systematic and reliable way of performing program updates is to express changes with <b>an</b> <b>update</b> language. In particular, updates should preserve the syntax- and typecorrectness of the transformed object programs. We describe <b>an</b> <b>update</b> calculus {{that can be used}} to update lambdacalculus programs. We develop a type system for the update language that infers the possible type changes that can be caused by <b>an</b> <b>update</b> program. We demonstrate that type-safe update programs that fulfill certain structural constraints preserve the type-correctness of lambda terms. ...|$|R
50|$|When LDAP servers {{are in a}} {{replicated}} topology, LDAP clients {{should consider}} using the post-read control to verify <b>updates</b> instead of <b>a</b> search after <b>an</b> <b>update.</b> The post-read control is designed so that applications need not issue a search request after <b>an</b> <b>update</b> - it is bad form to retrieve an entry {{for the sole purpose}} of checking that <b>an</b> <b>update</b> worked because of the replication eventual consistency model. An LDAP client should not assume that it connects to the same directory server for each request because architects may have placed load-balancers or LDAP proxies or both between LDAP clients and servers.|$|R
