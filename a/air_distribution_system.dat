40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>systems</b> {{are one of}} {{the major}} {{electrical}} energy consumers in air-conditioned commercial buildings which maintain comfortable indoor thermal environment and air quality by supplying specified amounts of treated air into different zones. The sizes of <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> lines affect energy efficiency of the <b>distribution</b> <b>systems.</b> Equal friction and static regain are two well-known approaches for sizing the <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> lines. Concerns to life cycle cost of the <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>systems,</b> T and IPS methods have been developed. Hitherto, all these methods are based on static design conditions. Therefore, dynamic performance of the system has not been yet addressed; whereas, the <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>systems</b> are mostly performed in dynamic rather than static conditions. Besides, none of the existing methods consider any aspects of thermal comfort and environmental impacts. This study attempts to investigate the existing methods for sizing of the <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>systems</b> and proposes a dynamic approach for size optimisation of the <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> lines by taking into account optimisation criteria such as economic aspects, environmental impacts and technical performance. These criteria have been respectively addressed through whole life costing analysis, life cycle assessment and deviation from set-point temperature of different zones. Integration of these criteria into the TRNSYS software produces a novel dynamic optimisation approach for duct sizing. Due to the integration of different criteria into a well- known performance evaluation software, this approach could be easily adopted by designers in busy nature of design. Comparison of this integrated approach with the existing methods reveals that under the defined criteria, system performance is improved up to 15...|$|R

To validate the computational fluid dynamics simulations, temperature, air velocity and CO 2 concentration were measured and compared. The simulation results of various combinations of ceiling and floor-based <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>systems</b> show that the exhaust should be located above the occupant and the window in summer; due to the large thermal plume as heat sources that could be generated by {{the window and the}} occupant.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, {{displacement}} ventilation systems have received significant attention and use in Scandinavia, Europe and Japan. Displacement ventilation differs from conventional “mixing ” or “dilution” ventilation by relying less on mixing via kinetic forces and more on stratification via buoyancy forces. With the tremendous increase in workplace automation in recent years, raised floor systems have found wider application due to their facility management advantages (e. g., flexible space and cable management). Accordingly, this has increased interest {{in the use of}} underfloor <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>systems,</b> which are naturally well-suited as displacement ventilation applications. The behavior of displacement ventilation systems, however, depends on heat and mass transport mechanisms that are computationally more complex than those required to analyze conventional mixing ventilation systems. These requirements are less forgiving to common simplifications contained in widely used HVAC design and energy analysis tools. Despite the potentially significant advantages of underfloor <b>air</b> <b>distribution,</b> the shortcomings in existing design and analysis tools will impede the use of underfloor <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>systems.</b> In this paper we briefly describe the significant features, potential advantages, and design issues associated with underfloor <b>air</b> <b>distribution.</b> We then briefly describe the simplifications of the current and emerging whole building energy analysis and HVAC design simulation tools that limit their utility for the analysis o...|$|R

50|$|MELs can {{be lowered}} by using fewer {{electronic}} devices, choosing more efficient electronics (for example, Energy Star appliances), modifying occupant behavior and managing standby power. Still, MELs {{are a significant}} obstacle in creating zero-energy buildings. Heating, cooling and water heating energy loads can be reduced by improvements to the building envelope, HVAC and water heating equipment, and <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system.</b> MELs are more elusive, however, because of their diversity. Many miscellaneous electric devices {{that can be found}} in a large fraction of houses are smaller—for example toasters, televisions and internet routers, while larger power draws, such as well pumps or waterbed heaters, are present in only a small fraction of houses. Such variety makes it hard to find a systematic method of reducing MELs. If MELs cannot be reduced, the only way to counter them is with larger (and thus more costly) solar arrays or other electricity generation methods.|$|E
5000|$|When air at {{atmospheric}} pressure is compressed, it contains much more water vapor than the high-pressure air can hold. Relative humidity {{is governed by}} the properties of water and is not affected by air pressure. Management of the excessive moisture is a requirement of a compressed <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system.</b> System designers must ensure that piping maintains a slope, to prevent accumulation of moisture in low parts of the piping system. Drain valves may be installed at multiple points of a large system to allow trapped water to be blown out. Taps from piping headers may be arranged at the tops of pipes, so that moisture is not carried over into piping branches feeding equipment. [...] Piping sizes are selected to avoid excessive energy loss in the piping system due to excess velocity in straight pipes at times of peak demand, or due to turbulence at pipe fittings.|$|E

In mixing type <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>systems</b> <b>air</b> is suppliedinto a room through {{various types of}} outlets and distributed byturbulent air jets. These air jets are the primary factorsaffecting room air motion. The ASHRAE handbook recognises fourmajor zones of maximum velocity decay along a jet. Although numerous theoretical and experimental studies havebeen conducted to develop turbulent air jet theory from the 1930 's, air jet performance in the further field from theoutlet is still not well understood. Many studies were therefore carried out, and the followingconclusions {{can be drawn from}} them:     The end centerline velocities of zone 3 for both "free"jet and wall jet could strongly depend on the outletvelocities and room size.     TheK-value of wall jets could be a function of bothoutlet velocities and outlet size.     It is very important to choose suitable sampling time toevaluate jet performance.     CFD can not always be used to predict jet behaviour,especially for the jet with low outlet velocity and in thearea far away from the outlet.

5000|$|The {{design of}} {{buildings}} that promote occupant health and well being requires {{clear understanding of}} the ways that ventilation airflow interacts with, dilutes, displaces or introduces pollutants within the occupied space. Although ventilation is an integral component to maintaining good indoor air quality, it may not be satisfactory alone. In scenarios where outdoor pollution would deteriorate indoor air quality, other treatment devices such as filtration may also be necessary. In kitchen ventilation systems, or for laboratory fume hoods, the design of effective effluent capture can be more important than the bulk amount of ventilation in a space. More generally, the way that an <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> causes ventilation to flow into and out of a space impacts the ability for a particular ventilation rate to remove internally generated pollutants. The ability for a system to remove pollution is described as its [...] "ventilation effectiveness". However, the overall impacts of ventilation on indoor air quality can depend on more complex factors such as the sources of pollution, and the ways that activities and airflow interact to affect occupant exposure.|$|E
50|$|The New York Times Company {{utilizes}} the underfloor <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> which strives {{for better}} indoor air quality, thermal comfort {{as well as}} energy saving. The conditioned air from the air handler is delivered through an air highway system that circumnavigates the service core {{and then into the}} six zoned off underfloor low pressure zones for distribution across the floor plate to all floor diffusers. Around each perimeter a series of fan power boxes control the temperature in the space. If heating is required then the fans turn on delivering heat via a hot water coil. In cooling mode, the fans operate to give increased ventilation around the perimeter spaces. Fresh air is supplied by two air handling units on the 28th floor sending fresh treated outside air to each floor where a constant volume VAV controls the amount of air entering the system. The air is then conditioned for proper cooling and humidity before being sent to the air highway. The New York Times Building also benefits from other general UFAD advantages. In the open plan office space that was implemented in occupied space from 2nd to 21st floors to enhance daylighting and outdoor views, the system provides flexibility to place the required equipment anywhere on the raised integrated service plenum. When departments or occupants needed to be reconfigured, the raised floor also enables maintenance to carry out changes at relatively lower expense.|$|E

A compact <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> locates the HVAC equipment centrally with shorter ducts run to interior walls, and ceiling supply outlets throw the air toward the exterior walls along the ceiling plane; alternatively, high sidewall supply outlets throw the air toward the exterior walls.
