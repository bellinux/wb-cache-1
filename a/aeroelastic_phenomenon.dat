40|$|Strong {{interactions}} {{can occur}} between the flow about an aerospace vehicle and its structural components resulting in several important <b>aeroelastic</b> <b>phenomena.</b> These <b>aeroelastic</b> <b>phenomena</b> can significantly influence {{the performance of}} the vehicle. At present, closed-form solutions are available for aeroelastic computations when flows are in either the linear subsonic or supersonic range. However, for aeroelasticity involving complex nonlinear flows with shock waves, vortices, flow separations, and aerodynamic heating, computational methods are still under development. These complex aeroelastic interactions can be dangerous and limit the performance of aircraft. Examples of these detrimental effects are aircraft with highly swept wings experiencing vortex-induced aeroelastic oscillations, transonic regime at which the flutter speed is low, aerothermoelastic loads that {{play a critical role in}} the design of high-speed vehicles, and flow separations that often lead to buffeting with undesirable structural oscillations. The simulation of these complex <b>aeroelastic</b> <b>phenomena</b> requires an integrated analysis of fluids and structures.

40|$|Circular {{cylindrical}} shell structures {{are sensitive to}} wind induced ovalling oscillations, which is an <b>aeroelastic</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> Coupled numerical models of the structure and the wind flow around the structure aim to predict the onset flow velocity. This paper presents a finite element model of a silo that is validated by means of experimental results that have been measured on a silo on which ovalling has been observed. The best agreement between measurements and calculations is achieved with a three-dimensional finite element model of the silo, representing the effective connection between the silo and the supporting structure. As the coupled three-dimensional calculation of turbulent wind flow around a group of silos is too demanding from the computational point of view, the structure is reduced to two dimensions using the finite strip method. Experimental results of available wind tunnel tests are used to validate this formulation; preliminary results for the steady state deformation of a cylinder under wind load are presented. ...|$|E
