5|$|African-Americans were enlisted during World War I, {{but this}} was halted in 1919 and they were mustered out of the Navy. Starting in the 1930s <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> {{recruited}} to serve as stewards in the officers mess. African-Americans were recruited in larger numbers only after Roosevelt insisted in 1942.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{widespread}} vandalism and violence, only twenty arrests {{were made on}} the day. The strikers intimidated the police, and only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> willing to arrest vandals. Chief Hyland and many officers were sympathetic to the strike, but the local judicial magistrates were not. According to one union report, union members who were arrested faced fines up to $50, while the arrested strikebreakers were immediately acquitted by a local judge.|$|E
5|$|Eckfeldt also {{produced}} a pattern disme, of which only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> struck. When the Mint's first cents (produced in 1793) {{were found to}} be excessively crude and attracted public ridicule, Eckfeldt was called upon to design replacements. He placed a wreath {{on the back of the}} cent instead of the original chain, and placed a trefoil under Liberty's head on the obverse. He also engraved the first half cent dies later the same year.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Iniki's {{high winds}} caused {{extensive}} damage in Kauai. 1,421houses were destroyed, and 63 were lost {{from the storm}} surge and wave action. A total of 5,152homes were severely damaged, while 7,178 received minor damage. On the south coast, hotels and condominiums received severe damage as well. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> restored quickly, though some took several years to be rebuilt. One hotel—the Coco Palms Resort famous for Elvis Presley's Blue Hawaii—never reopened after the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 the {{guidelines}} were changed to allow individual conventions to create additional categories, which was codified as {{up to two}} categories for that year. These additional awards were officially designated as Hugo Awards, but {{were not required to}} be repeated by future conventions. This was later adjusted to only allow one additional category; while these extra Hugo Awards have been given out in several categories, only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> ever awarded for more than one year.|$|E
5|$|In his own time, Bede was as {{well known}} for his biblical commentaries and exegetical, {{as well as other}} {{theological}} works. The majority of his writings were of this type, and covered the Old Testament and the New Testament. Most survived the Middle Ages, but <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> lost. It was for his theological writings that he earned the title of Doctor Anglorum, and why he was made a saint.|$|E

In practice, most of the sejms were still held in Warsaw, which hosted 148 sejms, compared to 11 sejms hosted in Grodno.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{becoming}} a tropical depression, Andres produced heavy rainfall in Oaxaca and Honduras, resulting in two deaths. Rough seas {{off the coast of}} Guerrero resulted in one fatality. Inland, flooding caused by heavy rains killed two additional people. An additional 20 people were injured. Several dozen structures were damaged and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> destroyed. Total losses from the hurricane reached MXN 3million ($231,000USD) in Colima. Following the storm, roughly 350 people were left homeless.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 100,058 Illinois Centennial half dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint during August 1918, with the excess over the round number {{reserved}} for {{inspection and testing}} at the 1919 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. There was no official packaging; <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> used in badges for the Illinois Centennial Commission. The coins were not publicized much outside Illinois. The centennial commission distributed them, at face value, to its county affiliates in proportion to their share of Illinois' population, on condition they be sold at a premium {{to help pay for}} local celebrations, and if one had already been held, for war relief.|$|E

5|$|As {{members of}} the Uand U1classes, rebuilds were used mainly on mixed-traffic as well as {{secondary}} passenger duties on lines between the main routes. They were used all over the Southern Railway network, but were little-used over the steep track gradients west of Exeter. The smaller-wheeled Nclass was preferred amongst crews for the same duties, as high-speed running was rare away from the main lines in the West Country. Heavier passenger work was allocated to Bulleid's Unrebuilt Light Pacifics, which were within weight restrictions in this area. The 21 rebuilt locomotives entered British Railways service in 1948. From 1955 <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> given replacement frames at overhaul: these had a shallower curve between the front buffer beam and the smokebox.|$|E
5|$|Classic Entertainments {{acquired}} the overseas distribution {{rights of the}} film in late February 2015, for an amount of 81 million, which was the highest price that any Telugu film had commanded in the overseas market until then.

5|$|Structure 4 {{is another}} pyramid-temple {{base on the}} west side of Plaza C. It has a low {{platform}} at its southeastern corner, where 48 severed heads were excavated immediately to the west. Schele and Mathews have speculated that these may be the heads of the K'iche' kings Tepupul and Itzayul together with other members of the K'iche' court who were captured by the Kaqchikels and decapitated. Most of the skulls were found with associated obsidian blades. Most of the skulls had been individually buried in pits cut into the floor of the plaza, although <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> grouped into small lots.|$|E

5|$|The Alamanni, {{who were}} {{originally}} from the Main valley of central Germany, had colonised the Agri Decumates (roughly {{the modern state}} of Baden-Württemberg in SW Germany) when the region was evacuated by the Romans in the mid-3rd century after belonging to the Roman province of Germania Superior for over 150 years. The Alamanni established {{a series of small}} pagi ("cantons"), mostly strung along the East bank of the Rhine (although <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> in the hinterland). The exact number and extent of these pagi is unclear and probably changed over time. Pagi, usually pairs of pagi combined, formed kingdoms (regna) which, it is generally believed, were permanent and hereditary.|$|E
5|$|The Martin AM Mauler (originally XBTM) was a single-seat {{shipboard}} attack aircraft {{built for}} the United States Navy. Designed during World War II, the Mauler encountered development delays and did not enter service until 1948 in small numbers. The aircraft proved troublesome and remained in frontline service only until 1950, when the Navy switched to the smaller and simpler Douglas AD Skyraider. Maulers remained in reserve squadrons until 1953. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> built as AM-1Q electronic-warfare aircraft with an additional crewman in the fuselage.|$|E
5|$|The {{tax system}} was {{partially}} reformed in 1881, allowing for direct payment of road taxes instead of relying totally on the statute-labor system. The first road district {{larger than the}} township level was created in Bay County in 1883 under Public Act278. This road district encompassed eight townships and provided for better coordination and planning of road construction. Other county systems were created in 1893 with passage of legislation which allowed other counties to {{follow the lead of}} Bay County. By 1900, the plank roads were generally abandoned. While <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> still in good repair, most consisted of rotting logs with intermittent patches of gravel. Toll houses were empty shacks, and the ditches were clogged with duck ponds. Only 23 of the original 202plank roads chartered by the state were still in operation.|$|E

5|$|The {{trials for}} the Columbia County {{residents}} held at Fort Mifflin {{were held in}} October and November 1864. At least three of those tried admitted to having been at a secret meeting on August 14, that many people were armed at the meeting, and that {{the people at the}} meeting intended to resist the soldiers in Bloomsburg. However, most of the prisoners were released on or before January 1865, although <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> held until May 1865. No one was charged for the murder of Lieutenant Robinson until 1891, when Elias Young was arrested and charged. Although Young admitted to firing a gun, he stated that two people in the party searching for deserters had fired first. The court ruled that Young was acting in self-defense, and he was declared not guilty.|$|E
5|$|The truck-mounted Katyushas were {{installed}} on ZiS-6 6×4 trucks, {{as well as}} the two-axle ZiS-5 and ZiS-5V. In 1941, a small number of BM-13 launchers were mounted on STZ-5 artillery tractors. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> also tried on KV tank chassis as the KV-1K, but this was a needless waste of heavy armour. Starting in 1942, they were also mounted on various British, Canadian and U.S. Lend-Lease trucks, in which case they were sometimes referred to as BM-13S. The cross-country performance of the Studebaker US6 2½ ton truck was so good that it became the GAU's standard mounting in 1943, designated BM-13N (normalizovanniy, 'standardized'), and more than 1,800 of this model were manufactured by the end of World War II. After World War II, BM-13s were based on Soviet-built ZiL-151 trucks.|$|E
5|$|Australia was {{a member}} of the {{international}} coalition which contributed military forces to the 1991 Gulf War, deploying a naval task group of two warships, a support ship and a clearance diving team; in total about 750 personnel. The Australian contribution was the first time Australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the ADF and the deployment tested its capabilities and command structure. However, the Australian force did not see combat, and instead playing a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against Iraq following the invasion of Kuwait. Some ADF personnel serving on exchange with British and American units did see combat, and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> later decorated for their actions. Following the war, the Navy regularly deployed a frigate to the Persian Gulf or Red Sea to enforce the trade sanctions which continued to be applied to Iraq. A number of Australian airmen and ground crew posted to or on exchange with US and British air forces subsequently participated in enforcing no-fly zones imposed over Iraq between 1991 and 2003.|$|E
