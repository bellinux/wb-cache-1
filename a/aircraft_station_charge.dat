The aim of this thesis is to design an efficient photo voltaic <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> and construction of omega type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station.</b> That's why various models were designed and calculated amount of energy. A photovoltaic <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> has 16 photovoltaic modules with dimensions 1293 mm* 329 mm* 34 mm. In this study five different type of solar <b>charge</b> <b>stations</b> were compared. These are, omega type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> (first type), south facing type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> with different angles (second type), south facing type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> with fixed angles (third type), inverse of omega type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> (fourth type), optimisation of south facing type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> with different angles (fifth type). After calculating of collected solar energy, the fifth type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> was chosen as the most efficient solar <b>charge</b> <b>station.</b> After these theoretical calculations, omega type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> has been installed on the Electrical Engineering Department's roof. Voltages and current intensitiesof omega type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> were measured from 28 June 2000 to 15 October 2000 {{in order to determine the}} solar power obtained and to compare it with the calculated values and measured data by Solar Energy Institute of Aegean University and meteorological station in Glizelyah.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{describe}} the brokerage function between electric vehicle users searching for a charging spot and the <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> providing the <b>charging</b> service. Matching supply and demand requires an interdisciplinary understanding of both the mobility of electric vehicle (EV) users and the load balancing mechanisms, at the <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> level {{as well as at}} low voltage grid level. As a result of a mobility study, we propose in this work a routing service for locating and reserving charging spots. Further, we extend the search for <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> from a destination-neighborhood to public transportation node neighborhood in a multimodal route (using driving, walking, public transport) and evaluate the number and quality of solutions. Further contributions address the load balancing functionality at the <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> and the low voltage grid level. In the proposed decentralized architecture <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> control the <b>charging</b> of individual vehicles. We argue for the introduction of a bidirectional interface between the <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> and the DSO, and show how available power for <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> can be dynamically calculated...|$|R
