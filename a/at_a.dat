5|$|<b>At</b> <b>a</b> {{barometric}} pressure of 218 atmospheres, the critical point {{of water is}} 375°C. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> depth of 3,000meters, the {{barometric pressure}} of sea water is more than 300atmospheres (as salt water is denser than fresh water). At this depth and pressure, seawater becomes supercritical <b>at</b> <b>a</b> temperature of 407°C (see image). However the increase in salinity at this depth pushes the water closer to its critical point. Thus, water emerging from the hottest parts of some hydrothermal vents, black smokers and submarine volcanoes can be a supercritical fluid, possessing physical properties between those of a gas and those of a liquid.|$|E
