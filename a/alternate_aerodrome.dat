2500|$|Due to {{the runway}} length and the {{distance}} to South Africa (3700km to Johannesburg), a Boeing 737-700 flying to Johannesburg serving St Helena {{would not be able}} to use its full seat and cargo capacity. Only flights to and from Namibian and Angolan destinations would allow using a Boeing 737-700 near its full load capacity. This was under the condition that both directions of the runway were available so tailwind landings could be avoided. The other planned destination, London, requires a fuel stop in Gambia, at almost the same distance as Johannesburg. [...] However, if Wideawake Airfield on Ascension Island was open for commercial non-military flights, it could be listed as an alternate aerodrome; as it is only 1300km from St Helena this would mean that the load capacity of an inbound Boeing 737-700 could be increased as smaller fuel reserves would be required, since the <b>alternate</b> <b>aerodrome</b> could be used in case of problems at St. Helena.|$|E

50|$|The {{uncommon}} network {{operated by}} Air Tahiti {{has allowed the}} company to obtain the ETOPS certification. Air Tahiti was the 1st company to obtain this certification for the ATR 72. As a safety measure, aircraft flying over water must never {{be more than a}} certain distance away from an <b>alternate</b> <b>aerodrome.</b> In view of this constraint, some flights cannot follow a linear route, but instead proceed in a broken line.Air Tahiti is not concerned with this restriction as ETOPS (Extended Twin Operations) has been approved on many aircraft thus allowing us to minimise the flight duration and maximise payload as well as including an island to the list of routes permitted.Without this certification, the ATR 72 could not operate between Tahiti and Nuku Hiva.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} make their {{decision}} for departure, the crew obtained the observed weather data and the weather forecast for the takeoff, landing and <b>alternate</b> <b>aerodromes</b> all of which met the requirements for IFR flights. All the crew were correctly licensed and adequately rested to operate the flight.|$|R
25|$|The Air {{forces in}} Angola {{were under the}} command of the 2nd Air Region of the Portuguese Air Force, with {{headquarters}} in Luanda. They included a central air base (the Air Base 9 at Luanda) and two sector air bases (the Base-Aerodrome 3 at Negage, UÃ­ge and the Base-Aerodrome 4 at Henrique de Carvalho, Lunda). A fourth air base was being built (Base-Aerodrome 10 at Serpa Pinto, Cuando-Cubando), but it was not completed {{before the end of the}} conflict. These bases controlled a number of satellite air fields, including maneuver and <b>alternate</b> <b>aerodromes.</b> Besides these, the Air Force also could count with a number of additional airfields, including those of some of the Army garrisons, in some of which air detachments were permanently deployed. The Air Force also maintained in Angola, the Paratrooper Battalion 21, which served as a mobile intervention unit, with its forces initially being deployed by parachute, but latter being mainly used in air assaults by helicopter. The Air Force was supported by the voluntary air formations, composed of civil pilots, mainly from local flying clubs, who operated light aircraft mainly in air logistics support missions. In the beginning of the conflict, the Air Force had only a few aircraft stationed in Angola, including 25 F-84G jet fighter-bombers, six PV-2 Harpoon bombers, six Nord Noratlas transport aircraft, six Alouette II helicopters, eight T-6 light attack aircraft and eight Auster light observation aircraft. By the early 1970s, it had available four F-84G, six PV-2 Harpoon, 13 Nord Noratlas, C-47 and C-57 transport aircraft, 30 Alouette III and Puma helicopters, 18 T-6 and 26 Dornier Do 27 observation aircraft. Despite the increase, the number of aircraft was always too few to cover the enormous Angolan territory, besides many being old aircraft difficult to maintain in flying conditions. From the late 1960s, the Portuguese forces in southern Angola were able to count with the support of helicopters and some other air assets of the South African Air Force, with two Portuguese-South African joint air support centers being established.|$|R
5000|$|The {{airport in}} Lodrino is not {{directly}} operated by the Swiss Air Force, all flight operations in Ticino take place from the AFB Locarno.RUAG Aviation operates there, the Centre for maintenance of Helicopters, Propeller Aircraft and UAV systems. These are: Pilatus PC-6, Pilatus PC-7, Eurocopter EC635 ADS-95 and Pilatus PC-9. The Swiss Air Force use Lodrino only as <b>alternate</b> <b>aerodrome</b> for Locarno. There are only training flights for the paratroopers who {{jump out of the}} PC-6 Turbo Porter over Lodrino and get picked up there for the next jump. The airport is normally enabled only for military aircraft, only in case of maintenance, it is allowed to handle civilian air traffic. The interior of the tower was completely dismantled in 2010 ...|$|E
5000|$|The crew's conduct {{following}} discontinuation of {{the first}} approach attempt is inexplicable. Although it must be assumed {{on the basis of}} the witness statements and the pilot of the flight path that the crew realised what a dangerous manoeuvre they had carried out - instead of the unbuilt-up and flat outlying ground of the aerodrome a densely populated and hilly area came into view even before the normal ILS approach minimum was reached - no fundamentally new safety measures were taken. Apparently only the certainly expedient change of pilot and, consequently, instruments took place, which admittedly resulted in accurately flown turns and courses but still did not rely on the marker beacon emissions which were essential for an ILS in view of the atmospheric disturbances. Instead of requesting the help of Air Traffic Control, who were intermittently occupied with other aircraft, or diverting to an <b>alternate</b> <b>aerodrome,</b> they may well have attempted, according to a possible interpretation of the tape recording, to make the second approach using only localizer and glide path and time and course navigation, which could not succeed in view of the [...] "bungled" [...] situation. The fact that the second approach was initiated with position report MN in the immediate vicinity of the BS beacon could be looked upon as a further confusion of navigational aids.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this final report was to {{investigate}} the communication of air traffic controller and pilot before landing and take off at Fatmawati Soekarno Airport in Bengkulu. Communication between Pilot and Air Traffic Controller is exchange of Information About weather, wind direction, speed, visibility, high cloud, navigation condition, and <b>alternate</b> <b>aerodrome.</b> Accident of an aircraft was caused by miscommunication, either skidding out of the runway or over running the end of it. In controlling of an aircraft Air Traffic Controller must give good service because aircraft operational suitable of Air Traffic Controller direction. All of them are obliged to think and rethink about the present system related to the safety aspect of air transportation in this country. It is therefore suggested that there should be efforts to improve the working of Air Traffic Controller to avoid the accident at Fatmawati Soekarno Airport in Bengkulu that causes by human error...|$|E
