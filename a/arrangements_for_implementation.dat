Implementing IWRM requires cooperation between policy sectors, countries, government bodies, the civic sector and scientific disciplines. The social learning approach suggests several ingredients for such cooperation. First, water managers and the other stakeholders need to realize their dependence on each other for reaching their own goals. Next, they need to start interacting, share their problem perceptions and develop different potential solutions. This requires the development of mutual trust, recognition of diversity and critical self-reflection.

Using institutional theories about levels of decision making provides a way of classifying collaboratives along a spectrum from action level to organizational level to policy level. This typology is applied to thirty-six collaboration case studies in Australia and the United States that were investigated over a series of years through interviews, observation, document analysis, and surveys.

40|$|Intergovernmental fiscal {{transfers}} are {{a dominant}} feature of sub-national finance in most countries. They {{are used to}} ensure that revenues roughly match the expenditure needs of various orders (levels) of sub-national governments. They are also used to advance national, regional and local area objectives such as fairness and equity and creating a common economic union. The structure of these transfers create incentives for national, regional and local governments that have a bearing on fiscal management, macroeconomic stability, distributional equity, allocative efficiency and public services delivery.

The study {{aimed to}} {{understand}} and analyse {{the ways in which}} the NFVF as the institution mandated by government to implement its vision for the film industry, interpreted and executed this mandate in its inception years. Using a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches to policy implementation, this study applied the 5 -C protocol developed by Brynard and de Coning (2006) to analyse film policy. The study assesses the process of implementation and the key factors that shaped how the NFVF carried out its policy mandate between 2000 and 2005 largely from the perspective of ‘street-level bureaucrats’ who were the main policy implementation officials. Implementation scholars suggest that in order to understand policy, one is required to follow its journey as it moves through the implementation process, changing its environment, and in turn being influenced by the environment within which it is located. The study’s findings are discussed under various themes that emerged from the interviews and document review. The focus is on the NFVF’s policy content and implications this had on the clarity of its role and mandate. The themes that emerged from the discussion on the NFVF’s policy context indicated that the governance and institutional <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>implementation</b> as well as the lack of policy coherence and co-ordination contributed to a difficult operating and implementation environment. Under policy commitment, the discussion pointed to the NFVF’s leadership and institutional style between 2000 - 2005.

Finally, the last section of the study considers the NFVF’s policy clients and coalitions and how they responded to the NFVF‘s implementation of policy...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{design of}} {{variable}} stiffness components {{is of interest}} in several applicative contexts. One way to provide large stiffness variation is to use antagonistic stiffness in prestressed elastic systems composed of linear springs. Interestingly, such systems can be designedso that the stiffness in specific directions is only controlled by the prestress within the springs. In {{the absence of an}} adequate synthesis method, their exploitation for this purpose however relies today solely on the designer ability to find an arrangement of the springs that meet his requirements in terms of antagonistic stiffness variation. In this paper, a method is introduced for the synthesis of variable stiffness components using prestressedelastic systems. This method takes into account the antagonistic stiffness coming from the prestress and thus provides an efficient way to meet user-defined requirements. Several synthesis problems for usual variable stiffness components are assessed.

40|$|Cities in {{developing}} countries are suffering from growing infrastructure deficits due to rapid urban growth. Infrastructure, with a long service life, needs {{to take into account}} future climate change in its design. ‘Climate-proofing’ refers to the explicit consideration and internalization of climate change to ensure delivery of services made available by the infrastructure at acceptable levels over its service life. While the concept is well recognized, there are still limited cases {{in developing}} countries in proposing climate-proofed projects derived through quantitative assessments. Thus, this article first undertakes a comparative review of seven cases {{in developing countries}} in Asia ([i] urban floods in Bangkok, Thailand; [ii] urban floods in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [iii] urban floods in Manila, Philippines; [iv] urban floods and [v] water supply in Khulna, Bangladesh; [vi] inland monsoon floods and [vii] cyclones in Bangladesh) where climate-proofing has been conducted, in order to identify advantages and challenges of climate-proofing. The review reveals advantages of climate-proofing, such as presentation of costs and benefits that will assist decision-making, preliminary designs of infrastructure, and specific recommendations of adaptation options. On the other hand, challenges include: (i) assessments are not made from the viewpoints of equity and legitimacy; (ii) costs and feasibility of supplementary measures (soft options) are usually not analyzed in detail; and (iii) assessments are time- and resource-consuming. Issues of uncertainties, although highlighted in these cases, have not been well incorporated in the analyses. The article thus secondly looks into robustness of adaptation options, by applying the four criteria used in the literature – no regret, reversible and flexible, safety margins, and synergies with other measures. An analysis of the proposed adaptation options in the water supply and urban drainage systems in Khulna, Bangladesh demonstrates that the consolidated options as a whole meet the criteria and are considered robust to uncertainty, while each option does not necessarily meet all the criteria. The assessment also identifies the need {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} each option, but further research is warranted to analyze distributional effects of adaptation options, and institutional <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>implementation...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{river basin}} {{committee}} (RBC) framework {{was first introduced}} in Thailand in 2002, and the current one adopted in 2007 has been implemented in all 25 river basins located in the country ever since. By all accounts, the RBC framework is innovative as far as Thailands administrative system and water resource sector are concerned. It was only recently that the former started to promote non-public sector participation, and the underlying legal framework expressly requires that representatives of the non-public sector, such as water user organizations and local experts, {{be included in the}} RBC together with those representing the public agencies concerned. The latter envisions the RBC as a new mechanism for managing water resources by using a river basin as a managerial unit. Based on the RBC frameworks prescription, {{it can be seen that}} Thailand is moving toward collaborative water governance, where both public and non-public sector representatives take part in decision making on water resource-related issues in their respective river basin. This study empirically examines the implementation process and outcomes of the RBC framework by using the Ping RBC arrangement as an illustrative case. It aims specifically to explore the formation and management of the RBC, its collaborative processes and participation, and the outcomes it generates. To this end, semi-structured interviews were conducted with key informants such as the officials responsible from Water Resources Regional Office 1 (WRO 1), and Ping RBC members; and an informal interview was applied as well with some DWR officials. In addition, relevant activities were observed through non-participant observation, while related documentary data, e. g. documents on the RBC framework, also were collected. The data gathered were analyzed by means of qualitative content analysis. It was found overall that the Ping RBC framework was established by following relevant directives. Ping RBC members include representatives from the public sector such as the Royal Irrigation Department (RID) and Department of Water Resources (DWR), as well as the provincial governors concerned and representatives from the non-public sector, including water user organizations (agricultural, industrial, commercial, service, and tourism sectors), local government organizations (LGOs), and the expert group; while WRO 1 serves as the secretariat. In addition, other governing bodies were established as well, including one river basin sub-committee, five provincial river basin working groups, and 20 sub-river basin working groups who, similar to Ping RBC members, represented both the public and non-public sector at the river basin, provincial, and sub-river basin level. It was discovered that regarding RBC management the Ping RBC and its governing bodies were governed by the lead organization-governed form, where WRO 1 played the leading role and left no room for involvement from other members. For example, it called the meetings and prepared their agenda. Indeed, meetings were the only activity organized for these river basin governing bodies and they were infrequent (e. g. twice per year for the Ping RBC). Furthermore, they were organized with a formal format, where the officer responsible normally provided information to the meeting, with virtually no deliberation or discussion. With these meetings being the only activity where members of the river basin governing bodies could get together, it was apparent that face-to-face dialogue, which is a crucial element in leading to others elements in a collaborative process, such as trust and shared understanding, was simply non-existent. Interaction between the secretariat and members of the river basin governing bodies, as well as among the members also failed to occur. Participation in the Ping RBC setup involved just information sharing, as members of the Ping RBC and its governing bodies were provided with only data on, for example, drought and flood situations. The governing bodies of the Ping River Basin, especially the Ping RBC, took part in approving river basin management and development frameworks as well as annual river basin management and development plans. However, their approval was unnecessary because the frameworks and annual plans in question were a collection of project plans gathered from the public agencies concerned and LGOs located in the river basin. They were prepared based on relevant policies and directives, with no need for approval from the Ping RBC setup before submission for national budget allocation. Since the frameworks and annual plans were the only outputs produced, it was therefore apparent that the Ping RBC framework performed virtually no functions to fulfill its mandates such as a water resource management plan, water user priority or water allocation. Evidently, the Ping RBC framework is an ineffective mechanism that is characterized by lack of collaboration, participation and outcomes, which have impacts on water resource management in the river basin. A similar result can be expected from the other 24 RBCs operating under the same administrative system and legal framework. Therefore, Thailand is still far from achieving collaborative governance in its water resource sector. Clearly, this unsuccessful RBC framework was influenced by the Thai administrative system; for instance, the public agencies involved have to follow their own policies and directives, thereby failing to make the RBC framework their top priority and only passively participating in the setup. However, the underlying cause is due largely to the RBC frameworks lack of authority. This is because the legal framework regulating the RBC framework has limited legal authority; consequently, virtually no authority is delegated to this arrangement. Accordingly, the RBC framework has no full authority regarding water resource management as its decisions, if any, can be enforced upon only public agencies and state-owned enterprises. Furthermore, it also has less authority when compared to other public bodies governed by superior legal frameworks; as such, it cannot force active participation in the RBC arrangement, and is not officially recognized (e. g. by the budget allocation system). It can be seen as important that with no authority delegated, non-public sector representatives do not share any decision making power despite their inclusion into the framework concerned. Therefore, to avert the same result generated by the RBC framework in moving toward collaborative water governance, policy changes are needed regarding its authority and implementation process at the national level, or at the DWR. Ideally, a change is required at the national level by passing a comprehensive legal framework, i. e. a Water Act. By this law, the RBC frameworks authority in managing water resources is secured and the framework itself is officially recognized. <b>Arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>implementation</b> of the RBC framework also can be prescribed, e. g. a budget allocation system recognizing the RBC framework and creating the RBCs own office. However, this option is rather difficult to achieve, if not impossible, due to the lack of political support. A more probable change at the national level would be to issue a new regulation that revises the RBC framework, which can be done more easily than passing a law. Essentially, under this new regulation, the new RBC framework would be based at the provincial level. As such, the RBC would be abolished, while the provincial RBC and its governing bodies would be transformed to collaborative watershed partnerships focused on a provincial river basin master/action plan. By this new regulation, the public bodies concerned would be obliged to follow the plan mentioned when preparing their water resource-related projects/programs, which would be applicable within authority of the regulation. In addition, diverse activities (e. g. meetings and capacity building) should be organized in order to support both the river basin governing bodies and implementing units of the DWR. The DWR should change its policies regarding implementation of the RBC framework, if there is no change at the national level, and the RBC framework continues to be carried out under the current regulation. It is essential in this circumstance for the DWR to encourage a revision of the RBC structure in order to make it less complex and more manageable, and shift the focus from the RBC itself to the river basin governing bodies at the provincial and sub-river basin level. Besides capacity building activities, and frequent and less formal meetings, the DWR should also direct its implementing units to facilitate the river basin governing bodies in order to develop a river basin management plan for respective provinces. This should be based on the problems and needs of the sub-river basins located in those particular provinces; and presented through the public agencies and LGOs concerned for consideration and inclusion in their own plans. This might be the only way to increase the likelihood of some elements of the river basin management plan being realized, given that the RBC framework has no authority or official recognition. Das Konzept der Wassereinzugsgebiets-Komitees (WEK) wurde in Thailand erstmals 2002 eingeführt, und die aktuelle Fassung von 2007 wurde bis heute in allen 25 Fluss-Einzugsgebieten des Landes umgesetzt. Auf alle Fälle ist das WEK-Konzept eine Neuerung für Thailands Administration und den Wasser-Sektor. Erst in jüngerer Zeit wird dort Parti¬zipation des zivilen Sektors propagiert, und die gesetzlichen (the Office of the Prime Ministers Regulation on National Water Resource Management of 2007) verlangen ausdrücklich, dass Vertreter der Zivilgesellschaft, wie Wasser-Nutzer-Organisationen und lokale Experten zusammen mit den Vertretern der öffentlichen Einrichtungen in die WEKs einbezogen werden. Das WEK wird als neuer Mechanismus für das Management von Wasser-Ressourcen verstanden, der das Wassereinzugsgebiet als Management-Einheit nutzt. Mit den Vorgaben des WEK-Konzepts bewegt sich Thailand hin zu einer kollaborativen Wasser-Steuerung, bei der zivile und öffentliche Sektor-Vertreter an der Entscheidungsfindung zu Ressourcen-Fragen in ihrem Wassereinzugsgebiet beteiligt sind. Diese Untersuchung betrachtet den Umsetzungs-Prozess und die Leistungsabgaben des WEK-Konzepts und nutzt dazu das WEK des Ping-Flusses als illustrativen Fall. Sie zielt darauf, die Einrichtung und das Management des WEKs, seine Zusammenarbeit und Partizipation und die Ergebnisse, die es erzielt, zu erkunden. Zu diesem Zweck wurden teilstrukturierte Interviews mit Schlüsselpersonen, wie den Funktionären des Regionalen Wasser-Ressourcen-Amts 1 (WRO 1), den Ping WEK-Mitgliedern, und offene Interviews mit einigen Funktionären des Wasser-Ressourcen-Departments geführt. Weiterhin werden wesentliche Aktivitäten nicht-teilnehmend beobachtet, und entsprechende Dokumente zum WEK-Konzept gesammelt. Die Daten werden mit Methoden der qualitativen Inhaltsanalyse ausgewertet. Das Ping-WEK-Konzept enthält die folgenden Direktiven: Zu den Ping-WEK-Mitgliedern gehören Vertreter des öffentlichen Dienstes, wie z. B. des Königlichen Bewässerungs-Departements, des Wasser-Ressourcen-Departments, die betroffenen Provinz-Gouverneure sowie Vertreter der Zivilgesellschaft, zu denen Wasser-Nutzer-Organisationen (landwirt-schaftliche, industrielle, kommerzielle, dienstleistende und touristische) gehören, sowie lokale Körperschaften und eine Experten-Gruppe. Das WRO 1 dient als Sekretariat des Komitees. Auch weitere Steuerungs-Gremien wurden eingerichtet, wie ein Wasser-Einzugs-Sub-Komitee, fünf provinzielle Wassereinzugsgebiets-Arbeitsgruppen und 20 Sub-wassereinzugsgebiets-Arbeitsgruppen, die vergleichbar zu den Ping-WEK-Mitgliedern sowohl dem öffentlichen als auch dem zivilen Sektor auf den 3 Ebenen Wasserein¬zugsgebiet, Provinz und Sub-Wassereinzugsgebiet angehören. Es konnte festgestellt werden, dass das Ping WEK Führungs-Organisations-gesteuert war, wobei das WRO 1 diese Führungsrolle hatte und keinen Raum für das Engagement anderer Mitglieder ließ. Es berief die Sitzungen ein und gab die Tagesordnung vor. Tatsächlich waren die seltenen Sitzungen, - höchstens zweimal jährlich - die einzige Aktivität des Ping Komitees. Diese wurden sehr formell abgehalten, wobei der verantwortliche Beamte den Teilnehmern Informationen vortrug, ohne weitere Wortmeldungen oder Diskussion. Da diese Sitzungen die einzige Aktivität war, bei der die Mitglieder zusammenkommen konnten, war es offensichtlich, dass ein persönlicher Dialog, der ein Schlüsselelement für weitere Stufen im kollaborativen Prozess ist, wie Vertrauen und geteiltes Verständnis, schlichtweg nicht stttfand. Auch gab es keine Interaktion zwischen dem Sekretariat und den Mitgliedern oder zwischen den Mitgliedern untereinander. Partizipation im Ping WEK war auf Informationsaustausch begrenzt, wobei die Mitglieder und Funktionsträger des Komitees mit Daten versorgt wurden, wie z. B. über Dürre- oder Flut-Ereignisse. Die Leitung des WEK engagierte sich bei der Bestätigung des Ping Einzugsgebiets-Managements-und Entwicklungskonzepts, und insbesondere des jährlichen Managements- und Entwicklungsplans. Jedoch war es eigentlich gar nicht nötig, diesen beiden Dokumenten zuzustimmen, denn die betreffenden Konzepte und Pläne wurden aus einer Abfrage bei den öffentlichen Ämtern und lokalen Körperschaften im Einzugsgebiet nur nebeneinandergestellt. Entwickelt wurden diese Einzelpläne aus einschlägigen Politikvorgaben und Direktiven, die keine Zustimmung des Ping WEKs brauchten, um für die nationale Budgetzuweisung eingereicht zu werden. Da diese Konzepte und Pläne aber das einzige Leistungsergebnis des WEKs waren, wurde es offensichtlich, dass das WEK-Konzept letztlich nichts leistete um sein Mandat zu erfüllen, weder Wasser-Resoourcenmanagement Plan, Wassernutzer-Priorität oder Wasser-Zuteilung beeinflusste, oder gar festlegte. Offensichtlich ist das WEK-Konzept ein unwirksamer Mechanismus, ohne Zusam¬menarbeit, Partizipation und Leistungen, die eine Wirkung auf das Wasser-Ressourcen-Management im Einzugsgebiet haben. Und einen ähnlichen Befund kann man auch für die weiteren 24 WEKs im Land erwarten, da sie unter dem gleichen Verwaltungssystem und Verordnungshintergrund operieren. Thailand ist noch weit enfernt davon, eine collaborative Steuerung seiner Wasserresourcen zu erreichen. Ursächlich dafür ist eindeutig das Verwaltungssystem. So müssen die öffentlichen Einrichtungen, die im WEK engagiert sind, vorrangig ihren eigenen Politiken und Richtlinien folgen, und damit geben sie dem Engagement im WEK nur nachrangige Priorität und verhalten sich so passiv wie möglich in ihrer Beteiligung. Dies liegt daran, dass das WEK-Konzept nicht mit Autorität ausge¬stattet ist, und deshalb wird dem WEK konsequenterweise auch keine reale Autorität gegeben, auch nicht für das Wassermanagement und die dafür nötigen Entscheidungen. Wenn je doch, dann würde das nur die öffentlichen Dienststellen und Staatsbetriebe betreffen, nicht aber die zivilgesellschaftlichen Akteure. Aber auch innerhalb der Administration hat das WEK weniger Autrität gegenüber allen Akteuren, die von höherrangigen Direktiven gesteuert sind, und so kann es aktive Partizipation nicht wirklich einfordern, und wird auch offiziell nicht wirklich wahrgenommen (z. B. vom Budget-Zuweisungs-System). Solange dem WEK keine Autrität zugewiesen wird, warden die Nicht-Regierungs-Vertreter im Komitee auch keine eigene Entscheidungsbefugnis teilen, auch wenn sie formal als Mitglied gelten. Daher sind politische Änderungen auf nationaler Ebene oder im Department für Wasser-Ressourcen nötig, die dem WEK Autorität und Entscheidungsgewalt zuweisen, wenn es Fortschritte in Richtung auf kollaborative Wasser-Ressourcen-Steuerung bewegen soll. Idealerweise könnte das ein nationales Gesetz bewirken, wie z. B. ein Wassergesetz. Durch ein solches Gesetz könnte das WEK-Konzept legal hochrangig verankert werden, und das WEK bekäme die notwendige Autorität, um offiziell ankerkannt zu sein, und die ihm zugewiesenen Aufgaben auch zu erfüllen. Es könnte ein eigenes Büro einrichten, und offizielle Budget-Anträge stellen. Allerdings ist diese Option schwer zu realisieren, dafür fehlt seit Jahren die politische Unterstützung. Eine eher wahrscheinliche Änderung auf der nationalen Ebene, könnte darin bestehen, die derzeitige Direktive und damit das WEK-Konzept zu verändern, was leichter erreichbar ist, als ein neues Wassergesetz zu verabschieden. Ein neues WEK-Konzept müsste dann auf der Provinzebene greifen. Das übergreifende WEK würde insofern aufgelöst, während die provinziellen Komitees dann umgewandelt würden in kollaborative Provinz-Wassereinzugsgebiets-Partnerschaften, und auf einen provinziellen Masterplan oder Aktionsplan zur Wassernutzung ausgerichtet wären. Die öffentlichen Einrichtungen in der Provinz müssten sich dann den Entscheidungen der Partnerschaften beugen und den Masterplan anerkennen, wenn sie ihre Projekte und Programme rund um das Wasser planen. Dann könnten auch weitere Aktivitäten geplant und finanziert werden, (wie Veranstaltungen und Fortbildungen) die sowohl die Mitglieder der Partnerschaft als auch alle ausführenden Personen im Bereich des Departements für Wasserressourcen fördern. Sollte es auf der nationalen Ebene keine Änderung geben, und das WEK-Konzept in heutiger Fassung fortbestehen, könnte zumindest das Department für Wasser-Ressourcen seine Politik ändern, was die Umsetzung des WEK-Konzepts betrifft. Dann ist es vorrangig, die WEK-Struktur zu vereinfachen, und den Schwerpunkt auf die Provinz- und Sub-Prvinz-Ebene zu verlagern, wo das Wasser-Ressourcen-Management tatsächlich stattfindet. Neben Aus- und Fortbildung und häufigeren und weniger formalen Treffen, sollte das Department seine Durchführungsebene anweisen, die verbliebenen WEKs dabei zu unterstützen, einen Einzugsgebiets-Management-Plan für die Provinz zu entwickeln, der sich auf die Bedürfnisse und Probleme der betreffenden Provinz bezieht. Dieser Plan sollte den öffentlichen Einrichtungen und Körperschaften zur Beachtung und zur freiwilligen Übernahme in deren eigene Pläne zur Verfügung gestellt werden. Eventuell ist dies der einzige Weg, um die Chancen zu erhöhen, dass der Einzugsgebiets-Management-Plan dann wenigsten in einigen Elementen verwirklicht wird, obwohl das WEK-Konzept in dieser dritten Option weiterhin weder Autrität noch öffentliche Anerkennung genießt...|$|E
40|$|Housing {{is not an}} EU competency, but housing policies, <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> their <b>implementation</b> {{and housing}} markets are key {{concerns}} of policy makers in European countries, because their effective operation has significant implications {{for the quality of}} life enjoyed by households, for the sustainability of communities and for economic development. Therefore, since 1989 the housing ministers of European Union (EU) member States have met regularly to discuss issues related to housing policy and sustainable development. In order to inform these discussions, in 2000 and 2001 a synthesis report summarising housing developments in European countries was prepared by France and Belgium, which held the presidency of the Council of the EU during these years. To mark its presidency of the EU, {{during the first half of}} 2004, Ireland has prepared this updated report on recent housing developments across Europe. This report was presented to a meeting of housing focal points representative of housing ministries from European countries, held in the Netherlands in November 2004...|$|R

We analyse the legal statute, the institutional <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> its <b>implementation</b> and the case law since 1985. We find that Cartel Commission which was given wide discretion by the law has been relative immune from judicial and political challenge and vulnerable to interest groups. The analysis of the relevant markets, the evaluation of dominance and that of countervailing benefits tend to be poorly motivated. In addition, the concept of effective competition, which {{is central to the}} implementation of the law, has not been substantiated by the case law. Accordingly, the decisions tend to be highly judgmental, which reflects the weak accountability of the Commission. Fortunately, both the substantial provisions of the law and the institutional framework have been improved by the recent revision of the statute. Being more accountable, the Commission may not have the choice but to improve its practice...|$|R

Given the scale of the program and emerging interest in forest landscape restoration, the structure and function of implementation models is of interest. This study is based on key informant interviews tracing the structure and interactions among institutions <b>for</b> <b>implementation</b> of the CCFP from central government to provincial and sub-provincial scales in Yunnan Province. Data are used to analyze <b>implementation</b> <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> program planning, <b>implementation</b> and monitoring, and to identify features ensuring conditionality of PES payments. To assess the degree of voluntarism in enrollment, the study employs data from 87 household-level interviews in four southwestern provinces.

40|$|A {{sound quality}} policy, {{together}} with the organization and facilities {{to put it into}} effect, is a fundamental requirement, if an organization is to begin to implement TQM in agribusiness. For an organization to be truly effective, each part of it must work properly together, recognizing that every person and every activity affects, and in turn is affected by, others. Every organization should develop and state its policy on quality, together with <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> its <b>implementation.</b> The contents of the policy should be made known to all employees. The preparation and implementation of a properly thought out quality policy, together with continuous monitoring, makes for smoother production or operation, minimizes errors and reduces waste in agribusiness. Management must be dedicated to the ongoing improvement of quality, not simply a one – step improvement to an acceptable plateau. These ideas must be set out in a quality policy which requires top management to establish an ‘organization’ for quality, identify the customer’s needs and perception of needs, assess the ability of the organization to meet these needs economically. Key words: commitment, TQM in agribusiness, making a profit, quality policy, top managemen...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{projected}} {{increase in the}} demand for animal-source foods in developing countries, trends in livestock GHG emissions and other environmental impacts, there is an urgent need to change livestock production. Despite its significant role in global GHG emissions, the livestock sector also has a large potential to reduce its environmental impacts while increasing productivity. Mitigation practices also have other co-benefits, addressing land degradation (conservation of natural resources), livestock waste, resource efficiency and income generation for the rural poor. Progress in implementation of mitigation actions has been slow. There is limited information on emerging experiences with Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) development and implementation, pointing {{to the need to}} better document what is being done and to share knowledge and experience among interested countries. In particular, interested countries would benefit from better knowledge of the technical and stakeholder processes through which NAMAs are being developed; links between NAMAs and other livestock sector policies and programs; barriers to adoption of promoted practices and means to address them and financing <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> NAMA <b>implementation.</b> Supporting interested countries to share experiences in these and other dimensions would help reduce the gap between ‘intent’ and actual NAMA implementation...|$|R
40|$|Groundwater is {{presently}} {{the major source}} of rural domestic water supplies in Uganda. This water has excessive iron content and people use unprotected surface water instead. It is therefore important to find a user-friendly and sustainable method for removing iron from groundwater boreholes. The water quality in ten different boreholes in Rakai District was monitored focusing on iron. With earlier experiences from Uganda and other developing countries in mind, a prototype for iron removal was constructed and tested at the borehole in the village Ddwaniro. The water in this borehole had a ferrous iron content of about 10 mg/L. WHO recommends an iron content of 0. 3 mg/L. Results showed that a retention time in the filter of about 60 minutes could improve the removal of iron down to levels of about 1 mg/L. Based on the test results from the prototype a durable construction that may solve the problem with high iron content in boreholes was suggested. The suggestion for construction included an aeration step and a gravity flow sand filter. Finally a discussion concerning the institutional <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> the <b>implementation</b> of the suggested treatment unit was made. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of conceptual, normative and institutional issues of the Colombian Multidimensional Poverty Index (C-MPI). The principal questions are the following: What is the decision-making process that lies behind the Colombian experience? What are the main lessons from the Colombian case in terms of institutional <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> the <b>implementation</b> of its index? Although the medium and longer-term effects of the C-MPI on poverty reduction are still {{to be seen and}} thus to be evaluated, there are some important lessons. First, a multidimensional poverty index’s utility in terms of public policy depends not only on the mathematical and statistical robustness guaranteed by the Alkire Foster methodology but also on the ability of the policy maker to represent the public policy priorities through its normative choices. Second, acknowledging the inherent trade-offs involved in conceptual, statistical and public policy concerns is key to accurately defining the purpose of the measure. Finally, if the purpose of the MPI is to stimulate coordinated action to reduce poverty, an accurate design will not be enough; it is also necessary to provide a solid institutional architecture that supports the process from the design of the index to its application...|$|R
