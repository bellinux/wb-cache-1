5|$|He {{arrived in}} Killarney, Manitoba, in 1903, {{where he worked}} as a farmhand during the harvest. When winter came, he found work as a {{lumberjack}} in Fort William, Ontario. A voyage west followed, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>set</b> up a homestead in east-central Alberta. Once there, he began to practice dentistry, drawing on his army experience. On 9 September 1919, he married Marion Stuart. They had three sons and two daughters.|$|E
5|$|Their {{early career}} {{attracted}} much publicity, with each divisional promotion regarded {{by the media}} {{as part of an}} inevitable rise to the top ranks. Takahanada's progress was rapid <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>set</b> numerous age-related records, including the youngest ever makushita division tournament champion (16years 9months), youngest ever promoted to the second highest jūryō division (17years 3months), and the youngest ever promoted to the top makuuchi division (17years 8months).|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} home, Houston {{negotiated}} a labor-swap arrangement with Raven Hill's overseer Captain Frank Hatch. In {{lieu of a}} cash payment for his services, the bulk of Houston's slave labor force was engaged to work on Hatch's property at Bermuda Spring. The remaining slaves were retained as house labor for Margaret. Eventually, Houston became the owner of Bermuda Spring when he and Hatch swapped properties, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>set</b> about to build the Woodland home for his wife. The first child to be born {{in the house was}} Margaret (Maggie) Lea Houston, arriving on April 13, 1848, while Congress was in session and Houston was in Washington.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{there were}} no public art {{galleries}} in England with permanent collections. In 1816, {{in the face of}} his continued lack of success, Etty decided to spend a year in Italy to study the artworks held in the great Italian collections. He had made a brief visit to France in early 1815, but other than this had never been abroad. The 28-year-old Etty had fallen in love, and fretted about the difficulties a potential marriage would cause, and whether it would be right to travel to further his career even though it would mean taking his new wife to a foreign country. In the event, the woman rejected him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>set</b> out for the Continent in early September 1816.|$|E
5|$|Takanohana was the {{youngest}} ever {{to reach the top}} division at just 17, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>set</b> a number of other age-related records. He had a solid but aggressive style, looking to get a right hand grip on his opponents' mawashi and move them quickly out of the ring. He won over half his bouts by a straightforward yori-kiri, or force out. In his later career he suffered increasingly from injuries, and he retired in January 2003 at the age of 30. He is now the head coach of Takanohana stable and {{a senior member of the}} Japan Sumo Association.|$|E
5|$|Falko Bindrich {{was born}} on 17 October 1990 in Zittau, Germany, to parents Zdena and Oswald Bindrich. His father, Oswald Bindrich (born 1951), was an expert-level chess player, with a highest Elo rating of 2212. In 1993, {{at the age of}} three, Falko was taught chess by his brother and soon after, his father, Oswald, {{enrolled}} him the Oberland Chess Club. In 1998, he entered for the German Youth Individual Championship (under nine) and placed 28th out of 80 participants. After achieving second place in the 1999 German Youth U10 Individual Championship, he was allowed to attend the U10 European Championship where he finished only 39th. After this disappointment, he asked his father, Oswald, how he could improve, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>set</b> him on a daily training regimen with him and later consulted with stronger German players. In late 1999, he reached 1400 Elo, whereby his training sessions were extended and held with the likes of grandmasters Lubomir Ftacnik and Zigurds Lanka.|$|E

5|$|Newton's {{conversion}} was not immediate, but {{he contacted}} Polly's family and announced his intentions to marry her. Her parents were hesitant {{as he was}} known to be unreliable and impetuous. They knew he was profane, but they allowed him to write to Polly, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>set</b> to begin to submit to authority for her sake. He sought a place on a slave ship bound for Africa, and Newton and his crewmates participated in most of the same activities he had written about before; the only immorality from which he was able to free himself was profanity. After a severe illness his resolve was renewed, yet he retained the same attitude towards slavery as was held by his contemporaries. Newton continued in the slave trade through several voyages where he sailed up rivers in Africa now as a captain procured slaves being offered for sale in larger ports, and subsequently transported them to North America. In between voyages, he married Polly in 1750 and he found it more difficult to leave her {{at the beginning of each}} trip. After three shipping experiences in the slave trade, Newton was promised a position as ship's captain with cargo unrelated to slavery when, at the age of thirty, he collapsed and never sailed again.|$|E
5|$|Nothing can {{be gleaned}} from the {{contemporary}} skaldic poems on {{the causes of the}} battle. Adam of Bremen states that Olaf Tryggvason's Danish wife, Thyri, egged him on to make war against Denmark. When Olaf heard that Svein Forkbeard and Olaf the Swede had formed an alliance, he was angered and decided the time had come for an attack. Ágrip and Historia Norwegie have a similar account. Thyri was the sister of Svein Forkbeard, and when Olaf Tryggvason married her, Svein refused to pay her promised dowry. Angered, Olaf launched an expedition to attack Denmark, but he was too impatient to wait for a fleet to assemble from all of Norway, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>set</b> sail for the south with only 11 ships, expecting the rest to follow. When that hope was not realized, he set out for Wendland (Pomerania) to seek allies and on the way was ambushed by Svein and his allies. These accounts are contradicted by a contemporary verse of Halldórr the Unchristian which states that Olaf Tryggvason was travelling from the south {{when he came to the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} under Admiral Warren prepared at Spithead in December 1805 {{included one}} second rate, one 80-gun ship {{of the line}} and five 74-gun ships of line, but no frigates or smaller vessels to operate as scouts. Prevented from sailing during December by high winds, Warren remained off St Helens on the Isle of Wight until the middle of January, when the winds lifted <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>set</b> a course for Madeira. There he was to search for information of the French squadrons and, if no information was forthcoming, to sail for Barbados and augment the squadrons in the Caribbean. For the next two months, Warren remained in the central eastern Atlantic Ocean, aware that Willaumez was cruising to the south and that Leissègues had been destroyed off San Domingo. During February his force was joined by the independently sailing frigate HMS Amazon.|$|E

5|$|Van Meegeren {{felt that}} his genius had been misjudged, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>set</b> {{out to prove}} to the art critics that he could not only copy the style of the Dutch masters in his paintings, but produce a work of art so {{magnificent}} that it would rival the works of master painters. He moved with Jo to the South of France and began preparations for this ultimate forgery, which took him six years, from 1932 to 1937. In a series of early exercises, he forged works by Frans Hals, Pieter de Hooch, Gerard ter Borch, and Johannes Vermeer. Finally, he chose to forge a painting by Vermeer as his masterpiece. Vermeer had not been particularly well-known until {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century; his works were both extremely valuable and scarce — only about 35 had survived.|$|E

25|$|Edward mobilised his own faction {{and placed}} Leeds castle under siege, giving Isabella the Great Seal {{and control of}} the royal Chancery.

Before long, chroniclers record that Edward had an army of 30,000 men besieging Leeds castle, although this may represent an overestimate. The castle surrendered at the end of October and Edward took a vicious revenge on the constable and his men.

However, Kisch was released on bail when his lawyer took an appeal to High Court Justice Evatt, who again ruled that Kisch be set free. Evatt pointed out that, under the law, the minister had no power to rule on immigration matters after a person had entered Australia <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>set</b> up a hearing of the Full Bench of the High Court for March.|$|E
