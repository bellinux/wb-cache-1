Captain Frank Brooks, commanding at LZ Warheit, was dismayed to discover the PRT could not be quickly supported by LZ Warheit. From the PRTs position, that resembled {{the bottom of a}} funnel, it could not be seen or supported with indirect fire due to the multi-level and complicated local terrain. The tall mountains made a joke of two dimensional maps, and rendered pre-determined landmarks useless. Eventually supporting <b>aircraft</b> <b>scattered</b> the attackers, but if the weather had been a problem, air support would not have provided the decisive results.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the brief}} April War, the Germans had {{captured}} over 300 ex-VVKJ aircraft. They considered {{them to be}} of little use for the Luftwaffe, so {{it was decided to}} equip the ZNDH with an appropriate number of these <b>aircraft.</b> These <b>aircraft,</b> <b>scattered</b> in every corner of Yugoslavia, were then collected, minor damage repaired and stocks of fuel and spare parts stored at airfield workshops. Naturally, the majority of the aircraft were more or less damaged and action was undertaken to repair as many of them as possible. Former VVKJ pilots of Croatian background and other personnel of aeronautical specialty were approached and offered instant rehabilitation (most of them were in German POW camps), jobs and safety for their families.|$|R
5|$|One reason {{given to}} explain {{the failure of the}} bulk of the {{garrison}} to support the rebels was that a local VNQDĐ leader inside the garrison, Quang Can, had fallen ill in the lead-up and was sent to a hospital in Hanoi. When he heard of the failed uprising, he committed suicide. In addition, the insurrectionists had failed to liquidate the Garde indigène (native gendarmerie) post of Yen Bay town and were unable to convince the frightened civilian population to join them in a general revolt. At 07:30, a counterattack by tirailleurs of the 8th company of the battalion led by their French commander, backed by a single <b>aircraft,</b> <b>scattered</b> the mutineers; two hours later, order was re-established in Yen Bay.|$|R

500|$|By 04:30 the pathfinders {{had set up}} two Eureka beacons {{and landing}} lights to guide the {{transport}} planes to the correct drop zone. When the main force of C-47 aircraft arrived around 04:45 only seventy-three dropped their parachutists on the correct drop zone. The other fifty-three <b>aircraft</b> <b>scattered</b> their loads, mostly from the 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion, over the countryside, some landing [...] away at Cannes and Fayence. Only Brigade Headquarters arrived at the drop zone in one piece, Brigadier Pritchard landing only [...] from the Eureka beacons. The 4th Parachute Battalion had around forty per cent of its manpower and the 6th (Royal Welch) Parachute Battalion sixty per cent. By 06:30 Brigade Headquarters was established at Le Mitan and radio contact made with the American 36th Infantry Division, {{which at the time}} was still on their transports out at sea.

50|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} with the original AI radars was that the transmissions spread out over the entire front hemisphere of the aircraft.

5000|$|The {{projected}} {{weight for}} the aircraft was approximately 8 t. In {{order to reduce}} the weight of the aircraft and maximize the internal fuel, Arado did not use the typical retractable landing gear; instead, the aircraft was to take off from a jettisonable three-wheeled, tricycle gear-style trolley and land on three retractable skids, one under the central section of the fuselage, and one under each engine nacelle. This central main skid beneath the fuselage was originally intended to fully retract into the fuselage with skid-bay doors enclosing it, and was originally shown in a 1942-dated Arado engineering drawing, under its overall E 370 airframe factory development designation, as intended to be made from a three-sided channel-section component, featuring a set of nine triple-beaded wooden rollers within the channel-section mainskid, for ground contact purposes. [...] However, as with the operational Messerschmitt Me 163B rocket fighter which used a landing skid, it was discovered that such a skid-format landing gear for the Ar 234A design's prototypes did not allow mobility {{after the end of the}} landing run, which would have left <b>aircraft</b> <b>scattered</b> widely over an airfield's acreage, unable to taxi off the runway without remounting each and every aircraft on a trolley for towing off the landing area. Erich Sommer himself once noted for late 20th-century television that the landing skid-equipped prototypes, when touching down on a wet-turf airstrip, had a landing run characteristic that [...] "was like greased lightning" [...] and [...] "like on soap", from the complete lack of braking capability of the landing skid system.|$|R

The relation of the scattering coefficient to azimuth angle obtained during aircraft circles (antenna conical scans) is anisotropic and suggests that microwave scatterometers can be used to infer both wind speed and direction.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{formulation}} {{for the air}} mass factor (AMF) to convert slant column measurements of optically thin atmospheric species from space into total vertical columns. Because of atmospheric scattering, the AMF depends on the vertical distribution of the species. We formulate the AMF as the integral of the relative vertical distribution (shape factor) of the species over {{the depth of the}} atmosphere, weighted by altitude-dependent coefficients (scattering weights) computed independently from a radiative transfer model. The scattering weights are readily tabulated, and one can then obtain the AMF for any observation scene by using shape factors from a three dimensional (3 -D) atmospheric chemistry model for the period of observation. This approach subsequently allows objective evaluation of the 3 -D model with the observed vertical columns, since the shape factor and the vertical column in the model represent two independent pieces of information. We demonstrate the AMF method by using slant column measurements of formaldehyde at 346 nm from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment satellite instrument over North America during July 1996. Shape factors are computed with the Global Earth Observing System CHEMistry (GEOS-CHEM) global 3 -D model and are checked for consistency with the few available <b>aircraft</b> measurements. <b>Scattering</b> weights increase by an order of magnitude from the surface to the upper troposphere. The AMFs are typically 20 – 40 % less over continents than over the oceans and are approximately half the values calculated in the absence of scattering.

Comparison of the simulated and observed vertical columns allows assessment of model bias...|$|R

50|$|The peak {{intensity}} of the Battle of Britain came between 24 August and 15 September as the Luftwaffe put in its maximum effort to destroy Fighter Command. Mass raids aimed to saturate the defences. On 1 September over 200 aircraft attacked Maidstone, Biggin Hill, Kenley and Chatham. In joint action with the fighters, the guns of 1 and 6 AA Divisions broke up the attacks and shot down four aircraft, but the airfields at Kenley and Biggin Hill were badly hit. Next day a mass stream of Dornier Do 17s arrived over the Medway and flew up the Thames towards Hornchurch. They at once {{came under heavy fire}} from the 3.7 and 4.5 inch HAA guns of 28th and 37th AA Bdes {{on opposite sides of the}} river. Of about 100 bombers escorted by 190 fighters, 15 were shot down by AA fire. On 7 September over 300 aircraft approached the Thames Estuary, where the 15 HAA batteries of 28th and 37th AA Bdes split the formations up, although the Thameshaven oil wharves, Tilbury Docks, Woolwich and West Ham were badly hit.

40|$|The noise {{shielding}} potential of an inboard-wing catamaran aircraft when coupled with distributed propulsion is examined. Here, only low-frequency jet noise from mid-wing-mounted engines is considered. Because low frequencies {{are the most}} difficult to shield, these calculations put a lower bound on the potential shielding benefit. In this proof-of-concept study, simple physical models are used to describe the 3 -D scattering of jet noise by conceptualized catamaran <b>aircraft.</b> The Fast <b>Scattering</b> Code is used to predict noise levels on and about the aircraft. Shielding results are presented for several catamaran type geometries and simple noise source configurations representative of distributed propulsion radiation. Computational analyses are presented that demonstrate the shielding benefits of distributed propulsion and of increasing the width of the inboard wing. Also, sample calculations using the FSC are presented that demonstrate additional noise reduction on the aircraft fuselage by the use of acoustic liners on the inboard wing trailing edge. A full conceptual aircraft design would have to be analyzed over a complete mission to more accurately quantify community noise levels and aircraft performance, but the present shielding calculations show that a large acoustic benefit could be achieved by combining distributed propulsion and liner technology with a twin-fuselage planform...|$|R
40|$|Aircraft lidar {{works by}} {{shooting}} laser pulses toward {{the earth and}} recording the return time and intensity {{of any of the}} light returning to the <b>aircraft</b> after <b>scattering</b> off atmospheric particles and/or the Earth s surface. The scattered light signatures can be analyzed to tell the exact location of cloud and aerosol layers and, {{with the aid of a}} few optical assumptions, can be analyzed to retrieve estimates of optical properties such as atmospheric transparency. Radar works in a similar fashion except it sends pulses toward earth at a much larger wavelength than lidar. Radar records the return time and intensity of cloud or rain reflection returning to the aircraft. Lidar can measure scatter from optically thin cirrus and aerosol layers whose particles are too small for the radar to detect. Radar can provide reflection profiles through thick cloud layers of larger particles that lidar cannot penetrate. Only after merging the two instrument products can accurate measurements of the locations of all layers in the full atmospheric column be achieved. Accurate knowledge of the vertical distribution of clouds is important information for understanding the Earth/atmosphere radiative balance and for improving weather/climate forecast models. This paper describes one such merged data set developed from the Tropical Composition, Cloud and Climate Coupling (TC 4) experiment based in Costa Rica in July-August 2007 using the nadir viewing Cloud Physics Lidar (CPL) and the Cloud Radar System (CRS) on board the NASA ER- 2 aircraft. Statistics were developed concerning cloud probability through the atmospheric column and frequency of the number of cloud layers. These statistics were calculated for the full study area, four sub-regions, and over land compared to over ocean across all available flights. The results are valid for the TC 4 experiment only, as preferred cloud patterns took priority during mission planning. The TC 4 Study Area was a very cloudy region, with cloudy profiles occurring 94 percent of the time during the ER- 2 flights. One to three cloud layers were common, with the average calculated at 2. 03 layers per profile. The upper troposphere had a cloud frequency generally over 30 %, reaching 42 percent near 13 km during the study. There were regional differences. The Caribbean was much clearer than the Pacific regions. Land had a much higher frequency of high clouds than ocean areas. One region just south and west of Panama had a high probability of clouds below 15 km altitude with the frequency never dropping below 25 % and reaching a maximum of 60 % at 11 - 13 km altitude. These cloud statistics will help characterize the cloud volume for TC 4 scientists as they try to understand the complexities of the tropical atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|Airframe {{noise is}} {{currently}} of a comparable level to engine noise for an aircraft on approach with high-lift devices and landing gears deployed. The landing gears {{are a large}} contributor to the overall airframe noise in this situation. Main landing gears are typically installed beneath a lifting wing. The wing surfaces act as scattering surfaces for the noise generated by these landing gears, and the non-uniform ﬂow around the wing aﬀects both the propagation and strength of the noise. This thesis focuses on investigating the propagation and scattering of installed landing gear noise sources. Boundary element methods are capable of computing acoustic scattering by large and complex geometries, such as a complete aircraft geometry. However, due to their use of Green’s functions, ﬂow eﬀects can only be approximated. As a result, the refraction of acoustic waves due to a non-uniform ﬂow is not accounted for. A uniform ﬂow formulation based on a Lorentz-type transform is typically employed with boundary element methods. The eﬀect of neglecting refraction on the propagation and scattering of landing gear noise sources is determined in this thesis. Investigations are conducted using computational aeroacoustic methods that solve the linearised Euler equations, which account for the refraction of acoustic waves due to non-uniform ﬂow. Using computational aeroacoustic methods, the eﬀect of non-uniform ﬂow due to circulation on the acoustic scattering is quantiﬁed as the diﬀerence in acoustic scattering over uniform and non-uniform base ﬂows. These investigations are conducted using both single frequency and broadband monopole sources, and both single-element and multi-element airfoils. Increasing the angle of attack, increasing the Mach number, and deploying ﬂaps all increase the circulation around the airfoil. The eﬀect of varying these parameters is investigated systematically. It is shown that for a source in the approximate position of a landing gear with ﬂow conditions {{similar to that of}} an airliner on approach, the largest diﬀerence observed is at single frequencies for an airfoil conﬁguration with a deployed ﬂap. Otherwise, the diﬀerences are small, and in some cases so small that they can be considered negligible. It is shown that moving the source to a position above the airfoil and using a higher Mach number gives a larger diﬀerence, although this is not representative of a landing gear source. A new method is proposed to generate a broadband input signal for use with a computational aeroacoustic solver that gives a speciﬁed power spectral density at a given radial distance from a monopole source. A signal that is equal in power across a speciﬁed range of frequencies is generated using this method. The eﬀect on the frequency content of the scattered noise from a broadband source installed beneath a lifting wing is investigated using this generated signal. It is shown for a single-element airfoil that the major contributor to the obtained power spectral density is the distance of the source from the airfoil. Varying the angle of attack and Mach number has only a small additional eﬀect on the power spectral density. It is then shown that ﬂap and slat deployment has a larger eﬀect on the computed power spectral density due to the additional reﬂective surfaces. Existing boundary element method formulations that estimate uniform and nonuniform ﬂow eﬀects are evaluated for their suitability for landing gear noise scattering predictions. It is shown that the uniform ﬂow formulation is more suitable due to a simplifying assumption made in the derivation of the non-uniform ﬂow formulation. An existing realistic landing gear noise model is coupled with a three-dimensional acoustic boundary element method solver. The landing gear noise model applies scaling laws to directional databases for isolated landing gear components in order to estimate the total far-ﬁeld noise. The implemented coupling methodology is used to compute the sound pressure level on a ground plane beneath a realistic <b>scattering</b> <b>aircraft</b> geometry. The geometrical eﬀect of ﬂap deployment is investigated using sources of constant strength for each conﬁguration. It is shown that the eﬀect of ﬂap deployment is to increase the sound pressure level directly below and in the region immediately surrounding the aircraft. The eﬀect of source strength reduction due to circulation around a lifting wing is then included in the predictions. This results in a large decrease in the predicted sound pressure level on the ground plane with ﬂap deployment...|$|R
