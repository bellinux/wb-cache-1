5|$|Despite Oklahoma's role in instigating the {{construction}} of the Kansas Turnpike, its plans for a connecting turnpike fell through. The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority (OTA) had not performed a traffic study, as KTA had, to prove that the proposed Oklahoma turnpike would be profitable. Oklahoma also suffered from a poorer credit rating than did Kansas. Additionally, by this time many states' turnpike authorities were competing in the bond markets for investor dollars. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> combined made it difficult for OTA to issue bonds for its toll road. When funding had been obtained, political issues stalled the proposed toll road further.|$|E

25|$|Another {{reason that}} piracy may have appealed to some {{is that the}} pirate ship freed them from the {{hierarchical}} command structure, often enforced with violence, found in the navy and on merchant vessels. Still others may have become pirates to continue living in a homosocial world wherein they could practice their preferred sexuality.

25|$|Government can {{be defined}} as the {{political}} means of creating and enforcing laws; typically via a bureaucratic hierarchy. Politics is the process by which decisions are made within groups; this process often involves conflict as well as compromise. Although the term is generally applied to behavior within governments, politics is also observed in all human group interactions, including corporate, academic, and religious institutions. Many different political systems exist, as do many different ways of understanding them, and many definitions overlap. Examples of governments include monarchy, Communist state, military dictatorship, theocracy, and liberal democracy, the last of which is considered dominant today. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> have a direct relationship with economics.|$|E
25|$|Others, such {{as former}} Republican Secretary of Commerce Peter G. Peterson, have {{indicated}} {{that some form of}} rationing is inevitable and desirable considering the state of U.S. finances and the trillions of dollars of unfunded Medicare liabilities. He estimated that 25–33% of healthcare services are provided to those in the last months or year of life and advocated restrictions in cases where quality of life cannot be improved. He also recommended that a budget be established for government healthcare expenses, through establishing spending caps and pay-as-you-go rules that require tax increases for any incremental spending. He has indicated that a combination of tax increases and spending cuts will be required. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> would be addressed under the aegis of a fiscal reform commission.|$|E
500|$|In 1868, the Central Republican Board of Cuba and Puerto Rico was founded. The group {{organized}} {{expeditions to}} Cuba, offering supplies to movements {{that supported the}} independence of Puerto Rico and Cuba. Founded by José Francisco Basora, a Puerto Rican revolutionary and friend of Ramón Emeterio Betances, the group had connections within the wealthy sugar industry in the larger antille. Bonds for quantities of 100, 500 and 1,000 pesos were printed between June 1 and November 1, 1869, in order to cover the expenses of the two planned revolutions. On August 17, 1869, the board issued notes in denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 20 pesos, these were produced to establish an affordable alternative to the bonds. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> circulated throughout North and South America {{as well as the}} Caribbean. Although they were widespread in the Spanish processions, their use was kept clandestine to avoid imprisonment by the royal authorities. However, none of them was redeemed due to the failure of the Ten Years' War and Little War in Cuba. On December 17, 1866, Maria Christina of Austria signed a decree which authorized the auctioning of a railroad in Puerto Rico. In 1888, Ivo Bosch y Puig, an engineer from Catalonia, received the concession to put the project in march. In Madrid, Bosch y Puig established the Compañía de los Ferrocarriles de Puerto Rico (lit. [...] "Puerto Rico Railroad Company"). During this decade, Charles Skipper and East produced 5-peso banknotes in England, which were circulated after receiving the signatures of Bosch y Puig and an unidentified associate.|$|E

2500|$|Broadly speaking, existentialists {{hold that}} there are certain {{fundamental}} questions that every human being must come to terms with if they are to take their subjective existences seriously and with intrinsic value. Questions such as life, death, the meaning of human existence and the place of (or lack of) God in that existence are among them. By and large, the theories of existentialism assert that conscious reality is very complex and without an [...] "objective" [...] or universally known value: the individual must create value by affirming it and living it, not by simply talking about it or philosophising it in the mind.

2500|$|To gain an {{exemption}} or deferment, many men attended college, {{though they had}} to remain in college until their 26th birthday to be certain of avoiding the draft. [...] Some men were rejected by the military as 4-F unfit for service failing to meet physical, mental, or moral standards. Still others joined the National Guard or entered the Peace Corps {{as a way of}} avoiding Vietnam. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> raised concerns about the fairness of who got selected for involuntary service, since it was often the poor or those without connections who were drafted. Ironically, in light of modern political issues, a certain exemption was a convincing claim of homosexuality, but very few men attempted this because of the stigma involved.

2500|$|The brief pause from {{politics}} out of national grief at Taylor's death did not abate {{a crisis that}} developed over the land acquired after the Mexican–American War in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Aside from the issue of slavery in the territories, Taylor had faced four other major issues: demands that California be admitted to the Union, disputes over the Texas-New Mexico border, growing Northern opposition to the Washington D.C. slave trade, and Southern dissatisfaction with the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793. California, which extend across the western third of Mexican Cession, and whose population had grown larger than that of Delaware or Florida, was seeking immediate statehood. Texas claimed all of the Mexican Cession east of the Rio Grande, including parts of the former Mexican state of New Mexico that it had never exercised [...] "de facto" [...] control over, complicating the establishment of territorial governments there. The Washington, D.C. slave trade angered many in the North, who viewed the presence of slavery in the capital as a blemish on the nation. Disputes around fugitive slaves had grown since 1830 due to the improving means of transportation, as escaped slaves used improved roads, railroads, and ships to escape. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 had granted jurisdiction to all state and federal judges over cases regarding fugitive slaves, but several Northern states, dissatisfied {{by the lack of}} due process in these cases, had passed personal liberty laws that made it more difficult to return alleged fugitive slaves to the South. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> would remain unsolved when Fillmore took office.|$|E
