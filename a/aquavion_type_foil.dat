40|$|A side-entry <b>type</b> <b>foil</b> lens for {{insertion}} {{into the}} gap of the polepieces of a probe-forming lens was developed. The new design allows an accurate {{alignment of the}} foil lens and therefore better correction performance compared with the top-entry <b>type</b> <b>foil</b> lens previously used. The {{scanning transmission electron microscope}} (STEM) image taken with the foil lens at a large beam convergence semi-angle of 26 mrad showed the sharpness of the image to be similar to that taken without the foil lens at the optimum angle of 14 mrad, confirming correction of the spherical aberration. The optimum foil lens voltage giving the best image quality was in good agreement with the calculations of the probe current density profiles. The signal-to-noise ratio of the image was improved because of the higher probe current due to the increased beam convergence angle. This shows the effectiveness of the spherical aberration correction with the foil lens.

50|$|A {{metal foil}} is most {{commonly}} used as the conductive element of a flexible laminate. The metal foil is the material from which the circuit paths are normally etched. A wide variety of metal foils of varying thickness are available {{from which to choose}} and create a flex circuit, however copper foils, serve the vast majority of all flexible circuit applications. Copper’s excellent balance of cost and physical and electrical performance attributes make it an excellent choice. There are actually many different <b>types</b> of copper <b>foil.</b> The IPC identifies eight different <b>types</b> of copper <b>foil</b> for printed circuits divided into two much broader categories, electrodeposited and wrought, each having four sub-types.) As a result, {{there are a number of}} different <b>types</b> of copper <b>foil</b> available for flex circuit applications to serve the varied purposes of different end products. With most copper foil, a thin surface treatment is commonly applied to one side of the foil to improve its adhesion to the base film. Copper foils are of two basic types: wrought (rolled) and electrodeposited and their properties are quite different. Rolled and annealed foils are the most common choice, however thinner films which are electroplated are becoming increasingly popular.|$|R

40|$|AbstractVacuum {{insulation}} panels (VIP) combine high {{thermal performance}} with minor thickness making them fit for building retrofit. However, {{consisting of a}} fumed silica core at low air pressure (near vacuum) encapsulated by a protective aluminum containing covering, they are prone to puncturing which inadvertedly increases the internal air pressure and thus worsens the thermal performance. In addition to failure by puncturing, it remains unclear under which hygric circumstances VIPs degrade in time and how this {{is influenced by the}} Sd-value of the protective foil and thermal performance of the VIP. Therefore in this study the behavior of VIPs was monitored under various climates for measurement periods up to several years, allowing for a realistic assessment of the Sd-value of the foils and the degradation in time. Frequent gravimetric measurements were performed on 46 VIPs stored under ambient conditions and in climate chambers for periods up to 4 years. Based on EN ISO 12572 [1] the equivalent μd-values of the MF- 2 foils were determined. Comparing measurement results to literature it is found that water vapor diffusion resistances μ are in the range of 2. 66 – 7. 03. 10 ^ 7 for MF- 2 <b>type</b> <b>foils.</b> Overall, it can be concluded that hygrothermal loading for extended periods has a limited effect on the stability of the foil in time, ensuring the applicability of VIPs in building components...|$|R

50|$|Since air {{and water}} are governed by similar fluid equations—albeit with {{different}} levels of viscosity, density, and compressibility—the hydrofoil and airfoil (both <b>types</b> of <b>foil)</b> create lift in identical ways. The foil shape moves smoothly through the water, deflecting the flow downward, which, following the Euler equations, exerts an upward force on the foil. This turning of the water creates higher pressure {{on the bottom of}} the foil and reduced pressure on the top. This pressure difference is accompanied by a velocity difference, via Bernoulli's principle, so the resulting flowfield about the foil has a higher average velocity on one side than the other.|$|R

50|$|A study {{performed}} by Barclay and Wellman (1986) included two <b>types</b> of <b>foils</b> in their recognition task: {{ones that were}} entirely false and ones that were the original diary entry with a few details altered. Against the false foils, participants {{were found to be}} highly accurate at recognizing their true entries (at an average rate of 95%) and false foils were only judged as true 25% of the time. However, when judging between true diary entries and the altered foils, the altered foils were incorrectly judged as true 50% of the time. Barclay and Wellman theorized this was due to the tendency to group similar or repeated autobiographical memories into generic memories or schemas, and thus diary entries that seemed familiar enough to fit into these schemas would be judged as true.|$|R
