40|$|Previous {{research}} shows that people experience more self-agency when an outcome {{is in line with}} their goal, or with a subtly presented cue. The present study combined those findings by focusing on the effect of such subtle environmental cues on the experience of self-agency in goal-directed behavior. Participants had the goal to produce a certain color in a computer task containing no <b>primes,</b> goal-consistent <b>primes</b> <b>and</b> goal-inconsistent <b>primes.</b> They indicated whether they felt they were the cause of the outcome color or the computer was. Pupil dilation was used as a measurement of arousal resulting from inconsistencies between goals <b>and</b> <b>primes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>primes</b> <b>and</b> outcomes. Results showed people felt more self-agency when the outcome matched their goal; additional effects of primes were not found. Pupil dilation results did not indicate increased arousal of the sympathetic nervous system as a response to inconsistencies of goals <b>and</b> <b>primes,</b> or <b>primes</b> <b>and</b> outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Tensile bond {{strength}} and contraction gap tests {{were carried out}} using a new dentin bonding resin in association with various dentin conditioning <b>and</b> <b>priming</b> materials in vitro. For the tensile bond test, {{significant differences were found}} between the nonconditioned and conditioned dentin, <b>and</b> the <b>primed</b> <b>and</b> non-primed dentin surfaces. The strongest bond was obtained using a combination of phosphoric acid conditioning <b>and</b> <b>priming</b> with HEMA in glutaraldehyde at 151. 3 kgf/cm 2. Gap test results showed the presence of gaps in all of the test groups, but with variation in the extent of gap formation. A not significant, inverse correlation was determined between the tensile {{bond strength}} and gap tests (R = - 0. 65). The new bonding resin obtained good bond strengths in all cases, but high bond strengths can only be obtained with a combination of etching <b>and</b> <b>priming.</b> Similarly, the smallest gaps were associated with the etched <b>and</b> <b>primed</b> groups. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Robust evidence of this would {{support the idea that}} distinct explicit and implicit memory systems drive recognition <b>and</b> <b>priming,</b> <b>and</b> would constitute evidence against a single-system model (Berry, Shanks, Speekenbrink, & Henson, 2012). Across seven experiments using study durations ranging from 40 ms to 2250 ms, <b>and</b> two different <b>priming</b> tasks (a classification task in Experiments 1 a, 2 a, 3 a, and 4, and a continuous identification with recognition (CID-R) task in Experiments 1 b, 2 b, and 3 b), we found that although a longer study duration improved subsequent recognition in each experiment, there was either no detectable effect on priming (Experiments 1 a, 2 a, and 4) or a similar effect to that on recognition, albeit smaller in magnitude (Experiments 1 b, 2 b, 3 a, and 3 b).
