5|$|In {{contrast}} to phosphonium ylides {{used in the}} Wittig reaction, phosphonate-stabilized carbanions are more nucleophilic but less basic. Likewise, phosphonate-stabilized carbanions can be <b>alkylated.</b> Unlike phosphonium ylides, the dialkylphosphate salt byproduct is easily removed by aqueous extraction.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{chemicals}} such as {{vinyl chloride}} and hydrogen peroxide, and environmental chemicals such as {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} found in smoke, soot and tar create a huge diversity of DNA adducts- ethenobases, oxidized bases, <b>alkylated</b> phosphotriesters and crosslinking of DNA, {{just to name a}} few.|$|E
25|$|In the Zincke–Suhl {{reaction}} p-cresol is <b>alkylated</b> to a cyclohexadienone with tetrachloromethane.|$|E
25|$|In electrophilic {{aromatic}} substitution reactions, naphthalene reacts {{more readily}} than benzene. For example, chlorination and bromination of naphthalene proceeds without a catalyst to give 1-chloronaphthalene and 1-bromonaphthalene, respectively. Likewise, whereas both benzene and naphthalene can be <b>alkylated</b> using Friedel–Crafts reactions, naphthalene can also be easily <b>alkylated</b> by reaction with alkenes or alcohols, using sulfuric or phosphoric acid catalysts.|$|E
25|$|A {{synthetic}} {{procedure for}} <b>alkylated</b> semibullvalenes published in 2006 {{is based on}} cyclodimerisation of a substituted 1,4-dilithio-1,3-butadiene with copper(I) bromide. At 140°C the ethylated semibullvalene isomerises to the cyclooctatetraene derivative.|$|E
25|$|HfCl4 is an {{effective}} Lewis acid for various applications in organic synthesis. For example, ferrocene is <b>alkylated</b> with allyldimethylchlorosilane more efficiently using hafnium chloride relative to aluminium trichloride. The greater size of Hf may diminish HfCl4's tendency to complex to ferrocene.|$|E
25|$|Another {{commercial}} {{process is}} the Haarmann-Reimer process. This process starts from m-cresol which is <b>alkylated</b> with propene to thymol. This compound is hydrogenated in the next step. Racemic menthol is isolated by fractional distillation. The enantiomers are separated by chiral resolution in reaction with methyl benzoate, selective crystallisation followed by hydrolysis.|$|E
25|$|IUPAC {{recommended}} pKa {{values for}} this equilibrium {{in aqueous solution}} at 25°C are 8.99±0.04 (I= 0), 8.83±0.02 (I= 0.1M NaClO4) and 9.00±0.03 (I= 1.0M NaClO4; I= Ionic strength). Values for mixed solvents are available. Very strong bases, such as organolithium compounds, will deprotonate acetylacetone twice. The resulting dilithio species can then be <b>alkylated</b> at C-1.|$|E
25|$|In a {{standard}} oil refinery {{process known as}} alkylation, isobutane is <b>alkylated</b> with low-molecular-weight alkenes (primarily a mixture of propylene and butylene) {{in the presence of}} the strong acid catalyst derived from hydrofluoric acid. The catalyst protonates the alkenes (propylene, butylene) to produce reactive carbocations, which alkylate isobutane. The reaction is carried out at mild temperatures (0 and 30°C) in a two-phase reaction.|$|E
25|$|Methods {{designed}} specifically for 2-substituted pyridine hydrogenation can involve asymmetric systems developed for related substrates like 2-substituted quinolines and quinoxalines. For example, an iridium(I)\chiral phosphine\I2 system is effective in the asymmetric hydrogenation of activated (<b>alkylated)</b> 2-pyridiniums or certain cyclohexanone-fused pyridines. Similarly, chiral Brønsted acid catalysis with a Hantzsh ester as a hydride source is effective for some 2-alkyl pyridines with additional activating substitution.|$|E
25|$|Pyridine can be {{prepared}} by dealkylation of <b>alkylated</b> pyridines, which are obtained as byproducts in the syntheses of other pyridines. The oxidative dealkylation is carried out either using air over vanadium(V) oxide catalyst, by vapor-dealkylation on nickel-based catalyst, or hydrodealkylation with a silver- or platinum-based catalyst. Yields of pyridine up to be 93% can be achieved with the nickel-based catalyst.|$|E
25|$|Salts and esters of {{carboxylic}} acids {{are called}} carboxylates. When a carboxyl group is deprotonated, its conjugate base forms a carboxylate anion. Carboxylate ions are resonance-stabilized, and this increased stability makes carboxylic acids more acidic than alcohols. Carboxylic acids {{can be seen}} as reduced or <b>alkylated</b> forms of the Lewis acid carbon dioxide; under some circumstances they can be decarboxylated to yield carbon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|The α-carbon is {{important}} for enol- and enolate-based carbonyl chemistry as well. Chemical transformations affected by the conversion to either an enolate or an enol, in general, lead to the α-carbon acting as a nucleophile, becoming, for example, <b>alkylated</b> {{in the presence of}} primary haloalkane. An exception is in reaction with silyl -chlorides, -bromides, and -iodides, where the oxygen acts as the nucleophile to produce silyl enol ether.|$|E
25|$|The {{synthesis}} {{starts with}} the condensation of 3-acetylacetanilide (1) with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (DMFDMA) to give the eneamide (2). The anilide nitrogen is then <b>alkylated</b> by means of sodium hydride and ethyl iodide to give 3. The {{first step in the}} condensation with 3-amino-4-cyanopyrazole can be visualized as involving an addition-elimination reaction sequence on the eneamide function to give a transient intermediate such as 5. Cyclization then leads to formation of the fused pyrimidine ring to afford zaleplon (6).|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} common forms in which AAS are administered: oral pills; {{injectable}} steroids; creams/gels for topical application; and skin patches. Oral administration {{is the most}} convenient. Testosterone administered by mouth is rapidly absorbed, but it is largely converted to inactive metabolites, and only about one-sixth is available in active form. In order to be sufficiently active when given by mouth, testosterone derivatives are <b>alkylated</b> at the 17α position, e.g. methyltestosterone and fluoxymesterone. This modification reduces the liver's ability to break down these compounds {{before they reach the}} systemic circulation.|$|E
25|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} exist demonstrating how {{in certain}} autocatalytic reaction systems {{the presence of}} a small amount of reaction product with enantiomeric excess {{at the start of the}} reaction can result in a much larger enantiomeric excess at the end of the reaction. In the Soai reaction, pyrimidine-5-carbaldehyde (Scheme 1) is <b>alkylated</b> by diisopropylzinc to the corresponding pyrimidyl alcohol. Because the initial reaction product is also an effective catalyst the reaction is autocatalytic. The presence of just 0.2 equivalent of the alcohol S-enantiomer at the start of the reaction is sufficient to amplify the enantiomeric excess to 93%.|$|E
25|$|Asymmetric ion pairs {{can also}} be {{attacked}} in intermolecular reactions. In an interesting example, asymmetric addition of enol silane nucleophiles to oxocarbenium ions can be effected by catalytically forming the oxocarbenium through anion binding. Starting from an acetal, the chloroether is generated with boron trichloride and reacted with the enol silane and catalyst. The mechanism of formation of the oxocarbenium-thiourea-chloride complex is not fully resolved. It is thought that under the reaction conditions, the chloroether can epimerize and thiourea can stereoselectively bind chloride to form a closely associated ion pair. This asymmetric ion pair is then attacked by the silane to generate <b>alkylated</b> product.|$|E
2500|$|The acylated {{reaction}} product {{can be converted}} into the <b>alkylated</b> product via a Clemmensen reduction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{phosphine}} is also easily <b>alkylated.</b> [...] For example, benzyl chloride {{gives the}} phosphonium salt: ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{reaction}} depicted below, 1,4-dibromobutane {{is added to}} tert-butyl benzoate to form an <b>alkylated</b> 1,4-cyclohexadiene product: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{activity}} of the DNA glycosylase that removes methylated bases in human leukocytes declines with age. [...] The reduction in the excision of methylated bases from DNA suggests an age-dependent decline in 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase, a BER enzyme responsible for removing <b>alkylated</b> bases.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{nitrogen}} is more electronegative than carbon, metal-nitrosyl complexes {{tend to be}} more electrophilic than related {{metal carbonyl}} complexes. Nucleophiles often add to the nitrogen. The nitrogen atom in bent metal nitrosyls is basic, thus can be oxidized, <b>alkylated,</b> and protonated, e.g.: ...|$|E
2500|$|... 2-Methylimidazole (1) may be {{prepared}} via the Debus-Radziszewski imidazole synthesis, or from ethylenediamine and acetic acid, followed by treatment with lime, then Raney nickel. 2-Methylimidazole is nitrated to give 2-methyl-4(5)-nitroimidazole (2), {{which is in}} turn <b>alkylated</b> with ethylene oxide or 2-chloroethanol to give metronidazole (3): ...|$|E
2500|$|The most {{reactive}} {{position on}} indole for electrophilic aromatic substitution is C3, which is 1013 times more reactive [...] than benzene. [...] For example, it is <b>alkylated</b> by phosphorylated serine in the biosynthesis of the amino acid tryptophan (see figure above). Vilsmeier–Haack formylation of indole {{will take place}} at room temperature exclusively at C3.|$|E
2500|$|Alkenes can be {{prepared}} indirectly from alkyl amines. The amine or ammonia is not a suitable leaving group, so the amine is first either <b>alkylated</b> (as in the Hofmann elimination) or oxidized to an amine oxide (the Cope reaction) to render a smooth elimination possible. The Cope reaction is a syn-elimination that occurs at or below 150°C, for example: ...|$|E
2500|$|Reductive {{cleavage}} of the Cp2Fe2(CO)4 produces derivatives formally {{derived from}} the cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl anion, − or called Fp−, which is assumed to exist as a tight ion pair. [...] A typical reductant is sodium metal or sodium amalgam; NaK alloy, and alkali metal trialkylborohydrides have been used. [...] CpFe(CO)2]Na is a widely studied reagent since it is readily <b>alkylated,</b> acylated, or metalated by treatment with an appropriate electrophile.|$|E
2500|$|Organophosphines are {{compounds}} {{with the}} formula PRnH3−n. [...] These compounds are often classified {{according to the}} value of n: primary phosphines (n = 1), secondary phosphines (n = 2), tertiary phosphines (n = 3). All adopt pyramidal structures. [...] Their reactivity is also similar - they can be oxidized to the phosphorus(V) level, they can be protonated and <b>alkylated</b> at phosphorus to give phosphonium salts, and, for primary and secondary derivatives, they can be deprotonated by strong bases to give organophosphide derivatives.|$|E
2500|$|The British Geological Survey {{reported}} {{the amount and}} distribution of PAH compounds including parent and <b>alkylated</b> forms in urban soils at 76 locations in Greater London, UK. The study showed that parent (16 PAH) content ranged from 4 to 67mg/kg (dry wt soil) and an average PAH concentration of 18mg/kg (dry wt soil) whereas the total PAH content (33 PAH) ranged from 6 to 88mg/kg and fluoranthene and pyrene were generally the most abundant PAH. Benzopyrene (BaP) the most toxic of the parent PAH is widely considered a key marker PAH for environmental assessments; the [...] normal background concentration of BaP in the London urban sites was 6.9mg/kg (dry wt soils). London soils contained more stable 4-6 ring PAH which were indicative of combustion/pyrolytic sources such as coal/oil burning and traffic sourced particulates. However, the overall distribution also suggested that the PAHs in London soils had undergone weathering and been modified {{by a variety of}} pre-and post-depositional processes such as volatilization and microbial biodegradation.|$|E
