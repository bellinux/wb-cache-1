25|$|Admiral of the Fleet Sir Caspar John GCB (22 March 1903 – 11 July 1984) was {{a senior}} Royal Navy officer who served as First Sea Lord from 1960 to 1963. He was {{a pioneer in the}} Fleet Air Arm and fought in the Second World War in a cruiser taking part in the Atlantic convoys, {{participating}} in the Norwegian campaign and transporting <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Cape of Good Hope to Egypt for use in the western desert campaign. His war service continued as Director-General of Naval Aircraft Production, as naval air attaché at the British embassy in Washington D.C. and then as Commanding Officer of two aircraft carriers. He went on to serve as First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff in the early 1960s. In that capacity he was primarily concerned with plans for the building of the new CVA-01 aircraft-carriers.|$|E
25|$|John {{served in}} the Second World War {{initially}} with HMS York, {{taking part in the}} Atlantic convoys, participating in the Norwegian campaign and transporting <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Cape of Good Hope to Egypt for use in the western desert campaign. He was mentioned in despatches on 11 March 1941. Promoted to captain on 30 June 1941, he became Director-General of Naval Aircraft Production at the Ministry of Aircraft Production in summer 1941 and then naval air attaché at the British embassy in Washington D.C. from March 1943. There he arranged the training of British pilots in Canada and the USA and met the Russian aircraft designer Igor Sikorsky, with whom he discussed the introduction of helicopters for the Royal Navy after the War. He was given command of the aircraft-carrier HMS Pretoria Castle in August 1944 and of the brand-new light carrier HMS Ocean in June 1945.|$|E

25|$|A player may tackle an {{opposing}} {{player who has}} the ball by bringing them to ground. Once tackled, a player must immediately release the ball, either by passing to a teammate or placing it on the ground, and the tackler must release them and move away. After the ball has been released by a tackled player, players from either side may try to regain possession of the ball. Tacklers cannot tackle above the shoulder (the neck and head are out of bounds), and the tackler has to attempt to wrap their <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> player being tackled to complete the tackle. It is illegal to push, shoulder-charge, or to trip a player using feet or legs, but hands may be used (this being {{referred to as a}} tap-tackle or ankle-tap). Tackles that involve lifting a player and then forcing or dropping them to the ground head first (called a tip tackle or spear tackle) have been deemed particularly dangerous. A player performing this sort of tackle would typically be sent-off.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics {{were written}} in five minutes and are derived from U2's {{experience}} in Shinjuku. Bono has compared the lyrics to those in U2's 1991 song [...] "Tryin' to Throw Your <b>Arms</b> <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> World", as both depict the nightlife of a city. Lyrics were also inspired {{by the presence of}} the yakuza in Shinjuku; the group saw gang members with amputated fingers as punishment for their misbehaviour, which Bono has described as a [...] "very, very surreal" [...] experience. He has said that [...] "Slug" [...] was about avoiding harmful mistakes, stating [...] "we all play with things we shouldn't play with".|$|E
500|$|U2 biographer Bill Flanagan credits Bono's {{habit of}} keeping his lyrics [...] "in flux {{until the last}} minute" [...] with {{providing}} a narrative coherence to the album. Flanagan interpreted Achtung Baby as using the moon {{as a metaphor for}} a dark woman seducing the singer away from his virtuous love, the sun; he is tempted away from domestic life by an exciting nightlife and tests how far he can go before returning home. For Flanagan, [...] "Tryin' to Throw Your <b>Arms</b> <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> World" [...] on the album's latter third describes the character stumbling home in a drunken state, and the final three songs—"Ultraviolet (Light My Way)", [...] "Acrobat", and [...] "Love Is Blindness"—are about how the couple deal with the suffering they have forced on each other.|$|E

500|$|The college's {{collection}} of silverware includes a silver-gilt punch bowl, presented by Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn in 1732. The bowl, which weighs more than [...] and holds , was used {{at a dinner}} held in the Radcliffe Camera in 1814, to celebrate {{what was supposed to}} be the final defeat of Napoleon. Those present at the dinner included the Tsar, the King of Prussia, Blücher, Metternich, the Prince Regent, the Duke of York and the Duke of Wellington. There is a college tradition that the bowl will be presented to anyone who can meet two challenges. The first is to put <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> bowl at its widest point; the second is to drain the bowl of strong punch. The bowl measures [...] at its widest point, and so the first challenge has only been accomplished rarely; the second challenge has not been met.|$|E
500|$|... "Mysterious Ways" [...] {{featured}} a belly dancer on-stage. For the 1992 indoor legs, Florida resident Christina Petro was the dancer. Tour choreographer Morleigh Steinberg assumed the role {{starting with the}} [...] "Outside Broadcast" [...] leg. [...] "One" [...] was accompanied by the title word shown in many languages, as well as Mark Pellington-directed video clips of buffalos leading to a still image of David Wojnarowicz's [...] "Falling Buffalo" [...] photograph. For [...] "Until the End of the World", Bono often played with a camera, kissing the lens and thrusting it into his crotch, a stark contrast from his more earnest stage behaviour of the past. Beginning with [...] "Outside Broadcast", the band began playing [...] "New Year's Day" [...] afterwards. During [...] "Tryin' to Throw Your <b>Arms</b> <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> World", Bono danced with a young female fan from the crowd (a ritual he had done more solemnly on past tours), shared camcorder video filming duties with her, and sprayed champagne. At {{this point in the}} show, Mullen sometimes sang a solo performance of [...] "Dirty Old Town".|$|E
500|$|Before the U2 360° Tour commenced, [...] "If God Will Send His Angels", [...] "Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own", and [...] "Drowning Man", a {{previously}} unplayed song from War, were rehearsed, as was [...] "Even Better Than the Real Thing" [...] in the Perfecto mix style, while The Edge stated {{in an interview}} with Rolling Stone that [...] "Luminous Times (Hold on to Love)" [...] was also being considered. None of these were played during the first four legs of the tour. Willie Williams stated in his 27 June 2009 tour diary entry on U2.com that the band [...] "really wants [...] to work and it sounds great", {{but the rest of the}} setlist struggled due to the song's [...] "beautiful melancholy". In his 24 July 2009 entry, Williams noted that [...] "October" [...] and [...] "White as Snow" [...] were also being considered. [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday" [...] and [...] "Mysterious Ways" [...] were rehearsed in an acoustic style, but performances during the tour were done by the full band. Before the third leg, [...] "Tryin' To Throw Your <b>Arms</b> <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> World" [...] was also rehearsed.|$|E

500|$|Faced {{with intense}} {{competition}} from the other astronauts, particularly John Glenn, Shepard quit smoking, and adopted Glenn's habit of taking a morning jog, {{although he did not}} {{go so far as to}} give up the cocktails or the philandering. On January 19, 1961, Robert R. Gilruth, the director of NASA's Space Task Group, informed the seven astronauts that Shepard had been chosen for the first American manned mission into space. Shepard later recalled Louise's response when he told her that she had her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> man who would be the first man in space: [...] "Who let a Russian in here?" [...] During training he flew 120 simulated flights. Although his flight was originally scheduled for April 26, 1960, it was postponed several times by unplanned preparatory work, initially to December 5, 1960, then mid-January 1961, March 6, 1961, April 25, 1961, May 2, 1961, and finally to May 5, 1961. On April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person in space, and the first to orbit the Earth. It was another body blow to American pride. When Shepard heard the news he slammed his fist down on a table so hard a NASA public relation officer feared he might have broken it.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Smokin'" [...] was {{directed}} by Peter Gray and also appears on the DVD version of Songbook: The Singles, Vol. 1. The video begins with {{a shot of the}} Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appears {{on the cover of the}} Ice Hockey Hair EP. The logo fades out and the camera pans through a crowd of dark figures wearing berets towards a woman standing behind a long, black table. The woman is wearing a short sleeved black dress and has a blonde bob haircut. Her arms and face are illuminated in the otherwise dark room and she is shown walking backwards down the table, giving coloured cards to each of the figures wearing berets. The woman walks up and down the table observing the crowd as they each use the piece of card they were given to make an origami animal. As each person completes a model animal the woman gives them a new piece of coloured card. Approximately two minutes into the video the woman returns to a central position behind the table and looks down at one of the beret wearers. The camera cuts to show him screwing up a piece of green card into a ball which turns into an origami crane and flies away as he opens his hands. The rest of the figures in berets are shown from behind, bowing their heads before the camera cuts to a close up view of several origami animals on the table. These animals also begin to move, and interact with each other until a large red animal arrives. The camera cuts to a close-up of the red animal's head with smoke shown coming from its nose. The next shot shows the origami animals stationary on the table as the camera pans up to the beret wearers who are looking straight ahead while smoke moves across from the right. The woman walks up and down the table giving the beret wearers new pieces of card as they complete more and more origami animals. As the video draws to an end she rapidly piles up the origami animals into a heap in the middle of the table. When all the animals have been collected into the pile the beret wearers bow their heads and the woman puts her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> pile and smiles at the camera. In the final shot the woman places her hands on the table and stares at the camera as the video fades out to show the same Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appeared at the very beginning.|$|E
2500|$|It is not {{a problem}} for {{close-fitting}} neoprene suits, or hybrid suits with neoprene bottoms, which prevent air from easily moving into the legs of the suit. Wearers of baggy surface dry suits can mitigate the problem by venting out as much excess air as possible before entering the water. This is typically done by crouching down and leaning forward, wrapping the <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> knees, and then having an assistant zip the suit shut while it is stretched out tightly. Excess air can also be [...] "burped" [...] out of the neck or cuff seal.|$|E

2500|$|Despite his 'need to know', Sherrington {{states that}} [...] "as a teacher he had himself a wide and devoted following". His ward rounds were often crowded with students, attracted, as Brain puts it, by his [...] "gift of exposition, enthusiasm, {{and sense of}} the dramatic." [...] He endeared people to him with mannerisms which Sherrington states to have been [...] "very symbols of him." [...] One example of Head's {{confidence}} and unflappability occurred when he was listening to a female patient's heart. Without warning the patient threw her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> doctor and kissed him. Without hesitation, Head turned to his students, telling them calmly that this was [...] "typical, gentlemen, typical".|$|E
2500|$|Two days later, on May 24, {{the nude}} body of 27-year-old Nathaniel Cater, {{who had been}} missing for three days, was {{discovered}} in the river. The medical examiner ruled he had died of [...] "probable" [...] asphyxia, but never specifically {{said he had been}} strangled. Police theorized that Williams had killed Cater, and that his body was the source of the [...] "loud splash" [...] they heard as his car crossed the bridge. Williams subsequently failed three polygraph tests, and hairs and fibers retrieved from another victim's body were found to be consistent with those from his home, car, and dog. Co-workers told police they had seen Williams with scratches on his face and <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> time of the murders which, investigators surmised, could have been inflicted by victims during a struggle.|$|E
2500|$|On January 23, Clinton {{finally gave}} {{more than five}} hours of {{testimony}} on the Benghazi matter before hearings of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee. She said with a choking voice, [...] "For me, {{this is not just}} a matter of policy, it's personal. I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews. I put my <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters." [...] She again accepted formal responsibility for the departmental security lapses that led to the attack and deaths, but in explanation did not accept personal blame for them. She said, [...] "I feel responsible for the nearly 70,000 people who work for the State Department. But the specific security requests pertaining to Benghazi, you know, were handled by the security professionals in the department. I didn't see those requests. They didn't come to me. I didn't approve them. I didn't deny them." [...] She did acknowledge that she had supported keeping the Benghazi consulate open after an earlier debate about its deteriorating security, but said she had assumed the security personnel involved would address any issues with it.|$|E

2500|$|At {{least four}} veined octopus (Amphioctopus marginatus) {{individuals}} were witnessed retrieving coconut shells, manipulating them, stacking them, transporting them some distance (up to 20 metres), and then reassembling {{them to use}} as a shelter. The octopuses use coconut shells discarded by humans which have eventually settled in the ocean. They probe their arms down to loosen the mud, then rotate the shells out. After turning the shells so the open side faces upwards, the octopuses blow jets of mud out of the bowl before extending their <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> shell—or if they have two halves, stacking them first, one inside the other. They then stiffen their legs and move away in a manner which has been called [...] "stilt-walking". The octopuses eventually use the shells as a protective shelter in areas where little other shelter exists. If they just have one half, they simply turn it over and hide underneath. But if they are lucky enough to have retrieved two halves, they assemble them back into the original closed coconut form and sneak inside. This behaviour [...] The authors of the research article claimed this behaviour falls under the definition of tool use because the shells are carried for later use. However, this argument remains contested by a number of other biologists who state that the shells actually provide continuous protection from abundant bottom-dwelling predators in their home range.|$|E
