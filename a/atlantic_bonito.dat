5000|$|Many {{pelagic fish}} species, such as bluefish, <b>Atlantic</b> mackerel, tuna, <b>bonito,</b> and some sharks, swim {{continuously}} {{and do not}} show signs, behavioural or otherwise, of sleep. [...] It {{has been argued that}} one function of sleep is to allow the brain to consolidate into memory the things it has learned during the animal's normal period of activity. The brain {{might not be able to}} do this while still assailed by new stimuli and new information to process. Therefore the role of sleep would be to periodically shut down sensory input to allow the brain to form memories. Pelagic species swim in an environment that is rather boring (kilometers upon kilometers of open water with not much happening in it). In such species, the sensory input is so low that memory formation could take place even if the fish keeps on moving (a repetitive activity) and does not fall asleep in the traditional sense of the word.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bonito,</b> Sarda sarda, {{is a large}} mackerel-like fish of {{the family}} Scombridae. It is common in shallow waters of the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Black Sea, where it is an {{important}} commercial and game fish.|$|E
50|$|The little tunny's {{markings}} {{allow it}} to easily be distinguished from similar species. It is often confused with the skipjack tuna, the frigate tuna, the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bonito,</b> and the bullet tuna. Close relatives also include the kawakawa and the black skipjack. The scattering of dark, fingerprint-like spots between the pectoral and pelvic fins cannot be found on any related Atlantic species. The first dorsal fin of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bonito</b> is also lower and sloping. Its lack of teeth on the vomer can set it apart from its close Pacific relatives, the kawakawa and the black skipjack. The dorsal fins of the bullet and frigate mackerel are set apart. Unlike the little tunny, the skipjack tuna lacks markings {{on the back and}} has broad, straight stripes on the underside.|$|E
50|$|USS Bonita (SSK-3/SS-552), a Barracuda-class submarine, was {{the fourth}} ship of the United States Navy to be named for the bonito, a name applied to several types of fish, {{including}} the skipjack tuna, (Katsuwonus pelamis), the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bonito</b> (Sarda sarda), the lesser amberjack (Seriola fasciata), or the cobia (Rachycentron canadum). She was originally named USS K-3 (SSK-3).|$|E

50|$|<b>Atlantic</b> <b>bonito</b> {{belong to}} a group which have the dorsal fins very near, or {{separated}} by a narrow interspace. Its body is completely scaled, with those scales in the pectoral fin area and the lateral line usually larger in size.

50|$|Pacific and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bonito</b> meat has a {{firm texture}} and a darkish color. The bonito has a {{moderate}} fat content. The meat of young or small bonito {{can be of}} lighter color, close to that of skipjack tuna, and is sometimes used as a cheaper substitute for skipjack, especially for canning purposes, and occasionally {{in the production of}} katsuobushi. Bonito may not be marketed as tuna in all countries, however.|$|E
50|$|The {{little tunny}} is {{typically}} a schooling species. It lives in schools {{based primarily on}} fish size rather than species, so {{other members of the}} Scombridae family, like the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bonito,</b> may be present.

Larger schools are more common offshore whereas smaller groups may wander far inshore.|$|E
5000|$|The {{coloration}} of {{the little}} tunny is typically metallic blue or blue-green with dark, wavy stripes above the lateral line.

Frequently <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bonito</b> and false albacore, both members of the tuna family, enter the sound and can be caught by anglers from small boats and shore. Many species have declined rapidly since 1975 due to over fishing. Winter flounder may not be currently present except for rare, small local populations. Tautog and summer flounder are also less numerous. Anadromous fishes include striped bass, white perch, alewives, blueback herring, and American and hickory shad. Although several shark species likely infrequently wander {{in and out of}} the Sound, e.g. blue shark, mako shark, hammerhead shark & thresher shark, there are only four species of sharks which are regularly found in the area. These are the sand tiger shark, the sandbar shark, the spiny dogfish and the smooth dogfish.|$|E
5000|$|Commonly called false {{albacore}} or little tuna, it resembles the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bonito,</b> skipjack tuna, and species of mackerel. The little tunny feeds primarily on pelagic fish. It is best {{identified by the}} dark spots appearing between its pectoral and ventral fins and [...] "worm-like" [...] markings on its back. Commercially, the fish is used as bait for sharks and marlin due to its high oil content and hook retention. It {{is considered by many}} to be a trash fish because of its limited nutritional value; ciguatera poisoning related to its consumption has even been reported. However, the little tunny is commercially important in many locations, including the West Indies. It is marketed fresh, dried, canned, smoked, and frozen. It is sought-after as a sport fish due to its line-stripping 64 km/h runs and hard fighting ability when hooked. By trolling with lures near reefs, it can be caught on hook and line.|$|E
50|$|The Strait of Messina is an {{important}} migratory route of the Mediterranean Sea. The best known and important, from an economic point of view, are the great pelagic fish - that is the Tuna (Thunnus thynnus), the Albacore (Thunnus alalunga), the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bonito</b> (Sarda sarda), the Mediterranean Spearfish (Tetrapturus belone) and the Swordfish (Xiphias gladius). The fish of the Strait are captured with boats called feluche or small engine powered fishing boats called passerelle. These pelagic fish are assets unique {{to this part of}} the Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, only in the Strait, using various techniques, it is possible to capture Tuna throughout the year and in all age classes (from juveniles to adults) as the population moves between the Tyrrhenian and the Ionian Seas. The Strait of Messina is also an established route for the migration of Cetacea, and it is probably the most important in the Mediterranean Sea in terms of whale species diversity. Worthy of note, besides the several species of Dolphins are the Fin Whale (Balaenoptera physalus) and particularly the Sperm Whales which migrate to the Strait to their breeding area, probably the Aeolian Islands.

[...] 1 pageKnowing {{the feeding}} habits of marine predators is {{essential}} to understand their ecological role in the ecosystem. Moreover, this information is pivotal for an accurate management and conservation strategies of their populations. The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bonito</b> Sarda sarda is an epipelagic Scombrid distributed throughout the Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean and Black Seas. This migratory predator represents an important ﬁshery resource along its range of distribution, {{as well as in}} the NW Mediterranean. However, despite its commercial and ecological importance, accurate information of its trophic habits in the Mediterranean is very scarce. In this study, our main aim is to examine the feeding ecology (diet composition and trophic level) of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bonito</b> in the NW Mediterranean Sea by combining stable isotopic and stomach content methodologies at different temporal scales. Also we compare the trophic habits of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bonito</b> with information from several species of the same ecosystem to determine its ecological role. Our stable isotopic and stomach content results reveal a clearly importance of small pelagic ﬁsh in the diet of this top predator without seasonal changes in diet during the year. In particular, the diet of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bonito</b> includes the European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus as the main prey in its diet. Other pelagic species found in its diet are the European pilchard Sardina pilchardus and the round sardinella Sardinella aurita. These results indicate the position of this species as an important predator within the pelagic food web of the NW Mediterranean Sea and highlight that the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bonito</b> feeds on pelagic species that are ecologically and commercially very important in the area.

40|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bonito</b> (Sarda sarda, Bloch 1793) {{belongs to}} the {{important}} marine fish species with a wide geographical distribution covering the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean and its bordering seas. Aquaculture practices for this species are still in their infancies and scientific studies are seldom undertaken, mainly because of difficulties in sampling. Thus for small tuna species like the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bonito</b> only {{little is known about}} its biology and regarding the molecular background even less information is available. In the production of marine fish it is known that the most critical period is the larval stages, as high growth rates as well as significant developmental changes take place. In this study we have investigated the transcriptome of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bonito</b> of five larvae stages applying Illumina sequencing technology. For non-model species like aquaculture species, transcriptome analysis of RNA samples from individuals using Illumina sequencing technology is technically efficient and cost effective. In the present study a total number of 169, 326, 711 paired-end reads with a read length of 100 base pairs were generated resulting in a reference transcriptome of 68, 220 contigs with an average length of 2054 base pairs.

40|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bonito,</b> Sarda sarda (Bloch, 1793), is a scombrid {{that occurs}} {{throughout}} the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. In {{spite of the}} commercial importance of this species, very {{few studies have been}} conducted recently to improve the knowledge and understanding of its trophic biology. Immature <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bonito</b> from a single batch (body mass mean SD = 445 107 g, fork length mean SD = 30. 40 2. 19 cm, n = 17) were provided by the ‘Planta Experimental de Cultivos Marinos’ (Instituto Espa~nol de Oceanograf ıa, C. O. de Murcia, Mazarr on, Spain). Throughout the experimental period (November 11, 2011 – December 26, 2011), the fish were maintained under fasting conditions and natural photoperiod, temperature (17 – 20 °C) and salinity (37 ppt). Samples of liver and muscle were collected from three individuals {{at the start of the}} experiment (day 0) and subsequently on days 7, 14, 25 and 45. Body mass and length were recorded during samplings, and the Fulton’s condition index (K) calculated as K (g cm 3) = 100 weight length 3. The results derived from this study suggest that food deprivation induces increased d 15 N and higher variability in d 13 C values in liver of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bonito,</b> whereas the isotopic values of muscle do not significantly change throughout a fasting period of 45 days.

40|$|Knowing {{the feeding}} ecology of marine predators is pivotal to {{developing}} {{an understanding of}} their ecological role in the ecosystem and determining the trophic relationships between them. Despite the ecological importance of predatory pelagic fish species, research on these species in the Mediterranean Sea is limited. Here, by combining analyses of stomach contents and stable isotope values, we examined the feeding strategies of swordfish, Xiphias gladius, little tunny, Euthynnus alletteratus and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bonito,</b> Sarda sarda, in the western Mediterranean Sea. We also compared the trophic niche and trophic level of these species with published information of other sympatric pelagic predators present in the ecosystem. Results indicated that, although the diet of the three species was composed mainly by fin-fish species, a clear segregation in their main feeding strategies was found. Swordfish showed a generalist diet including demersal species such as blue whiting, Micromesistius poutassou, and European hake, Merluccius merluccius, and pelagic fin-fish such as barracudina species (Arctozenus risso and Lestidiops jayakari) or small pelagic fish species. Little tunny and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bonito</b> were segregated isotopically between them and showed a diet basically composed of anchovy, Engraulis encrasicolus, and round sardinella, Sardinella aurita, and sardines, Sardina pilchardus, respectively. This trophic segregation, in addition to potential segregation by depth, is likely a mechanism that allows their potential coexistence within the same pelagic habitat. When the trophic position of these three predatory pelagic fish species is compared with other pelagic predators such as bluefin tuna, Thunnus thynnus, and dolphinfish, Coryphaena hippurus, present in the western Mediterranean Sea, we found that they show similar intermediate trophic position in the ecosystem. In conclusion, the combined stomach and isotopic results highlight, especially for little tunny and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bonito,</b> the trophic importance of Clupeoid species in their diet. In addition, the importance of demersal resources for swordfish provides evidence for the pelagic-demersal coupling of the ecosystem {{and the need to}} manage marine resources in an integrated way...|$|E
