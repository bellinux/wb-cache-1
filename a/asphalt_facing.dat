40|$|AbstractAsphalt {{concrete}} is {{a traditional}} material used for the constructions of upstream sealing of reservoir dams, particularly in upper reservoirs of pumped storage hydroelectric plants. The asphalt layer is often exposed to significant fluctuations of temperature caused, for example, by heating the facing {{from the sun and}} by its subsequent rapid cooling by water during reservoir periodical filling. To better understand the physical phenomena and behaviour of the facing in terms of vapour diffusion, the state of stress, etc., it is necessary to know temperature phenomena in the <b>asphalt</b> <b>facing.</b> This paper describes the measurement of temperature in the <b>asphalt</b> <b>facing</b> of the Dlouhe Strane pumped storage hydroelectric plant and its evaluation using 1 D numerical model of heat flow in the asphalt concrete facing. Numerical simulation for selected load scenarios enabled the temperature phenomena that take place {{in the construction of the}} asphalt-concrete facing to be quantified. The analysis shows that during insolation, the <b>asphalt</b> <b>facing</b> is exposed to the significant temperature rise on its surface and also over its whole thickness. Similarly during frost weather the facing becomes frozen in its entire thickness. During the day cycle the temperature in the asphalt layers changes significantly. However, the temperature in the underlying rockfill dam body becomes steady approximately at the depth of 1. 0 m...|$|E

5000|$|The lower {{reservoir}} {{is created}} by a 97 m tall and 533 m long rock-fill dam with <b>asphalt</b> concrete <b>facing</b> on a mountain-side just about the Hutuo River. It can withhold up to [...] of water. The upper reservoir {{is created by}} a 50 m tall and 499.6 m long rock-fill dam with <b>asphalt</b> concrete <b>facing.</b> It can withhold up to [...] of water. Water from the upper reservoir {{is sent to the}} 1,200 MW underground power station down near the lower reservoir through headrace/penstock pipes. The drop in elevation between the upper and lower reservoir affords a hydraulic head (water drop) of 624 m.|$|R

40|$|AbstractImmediately {{after the}} 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake, special safety {{inspections}} {{were carried out}} at over 300 dams in the affected area. Damage was identified at more than 10 % of the inspected dams, with embankment dams showing a slightly higher ratio. Damage to embankment dams included relatively wide and/or long cracks mainly {{on the crest of}} earthfill dams, cracks in the impervious membrane of <b>asphalt</b> <b>faced</b> rockfill dams (AFRDs) and temporary increase in leakage. However, none of the dams {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) sustained damage severe enough to threaten the safety of the dam, although an old earthfill embankment dam for an irrigation pond located outside the area regulated by the River Law was breached due to the earthquake. In this paper, the results of special safety inspections are summarized, as well as those of subsequent detailed investigations of several embankment dams under the jurisdiction of MILT. The features of the earthquake motions observed at the dam foundations during the earthquake and their effects on the behavior of embankment dams are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} interest is rising {{on the study}} of rockfill embankment dams during overspilling. Design criteria of earth dams are being reviewed in many countries to guarantee an increasing safety level in front of an exceptional flooding. The possibility of studying the failure process is currently limited by the lack of a precise knowledge and by the absence of a suitable computational method which can predict accurately the onset and evolution of breaching. The analysis of the possible consequences of an accidental overspill is then impossible or very imprecise and the necessary economical measures for solving the problem are then inefficient. An appropriate computational method will help to reduce the economic impact of the investments in dam safety and in emergency plans for embankment dams. The dam failure is mainly due to the hydrodynamic forces acting on the rockfill material in the downstream face. Two failure mechanisms occur in an alternative or combined mode: dragging of rockfill particles with erosive effects, and loss of stability of a part of the downstream region due to the slippage of a bulk mass of the rockfill material. The loss of a relevant part of the rockfill material in the downstream side of the dam, can lead to mechanical failure of the impervious region, either if this is formed by a concrete (or <b>asphalt)</b> <b>face,</b> or by a clay core. In the latter case, erosion of the cohesive material can also influence the failure process, but the scale time of appearance of this erosion phenomenon is so different from the principal erosion of the rockfill part, that this second one is not taken into account. The objectives of the current work is to develop and validate a new computational method of general applicability that allows treating above problems. The method will combine advanced finite element and particle techniques. Fluid-structure interaction effects and non-linear geometrical and mechanical effects in the dam material will be considered. The specific features of the analysis method proposed make it appropriate to treat the rockfill material adjacent to the downstream surface where a transfer of momentum between the water running over the dam surface and that moving through the interior due to seepage occursPeer ReviewedPostprint (authorâ€™s final draft...|$|R
50|$|The Lower {{reservoir}} is {{the larger}} of the two and has easier public access with a tarmac road giving vehicular access to a small car park {{at the southern end of}} the dam wall. Access to the Upper reservoir and the woodland around it is by permit, there is a track with a locked gate which gives access for water board vehicles from the A57 road. The Lower reservoir has a capacity of , with a surface area of 12 ha, the dam height is 20 m and its length is approximately 300 m. The Upper reservoir has a capacity of , with a surface area of 4 ha, the dam height is 12 m with an approximate length of 220 metres. Both the dam walls are faced with stone pitching in the upstream direction and have grass banking in the downstream direction. In 2005 the dam wall of the Lower reservoir underwent strengthening work undertaken by the firm Hesselberg Hydro who used open stone <b>asphalt</b> to <b>face</b> the upstream embankment.|$|R
40|$|The Auckland {{concrete}} and <b>asphalt</b> industries currently <b>face</b> substantial {{change in the}} supply of their principal ingredient, aggregate rock, as key aggregate quarries have been mined to completion and are scheduled to close. Consequent economic and environmental conditions mean a number of Auckland {{concrete and}} asphalt plants are in turn expected to close, with new plants being built in more suitable locations, and possible modifications made to remaining plants for increased capacity. This paper discusses a transportation and blending model used to assist two Auckland companies: Firth Industries {{with regards to the}} location of their ready-mix concrete plants, and Works Infrastructure for the location of their asphalt plants. The model provides simulation and analysis of the expected costs involved with each of the various scenarios of plant locations currently under consideration by the respective companies, accounting for the raw material, blending and transportation costs. The choice of plant location is shown to impact decisions throughout the industry supply chain, influencing the selection of raw material suppliers, along with the assignment of customer orders to plants for final delivery. ...|$|R
