40|$|The TARGET <b>2</b> (T <b>2)</b> <b>positions</b> on {{the balance}} sheets of euro area {{national}} central banks (NCBs) have increased unprecedentedly {{since the beginning of}} the financial crisis. Currently only four euro area NCBs record T 2 claims, while the remaining NCBs are T 2 debtors. During the last twelve months, these developments were accompanied by a large public debate. The present article adds to the bulk of existing literature on this topic as it explains the origins and development of T <b>2</b> <b>positions</b> by means of a stylized framework of financial accounts. It is stressed throughout the article that T <b>2</b> <b>positions</b> constitute merely a reflex of underlying adverse developments in financial markets and of the elasticity of Eurosystem lending. Furthermore, the financial risks behind T <b>2</b> <b>positions,</b> and the relationship to the monetary base, the euro area’s liquidity deficit and intra-euro-area current account deficits are discussed in greater detail. Finally, we discuss recent proposals to limit T <b>2</b> <b>positions</b> and we provide several superior measures of how to re-balance T <b>2</b> <b>positions...</b>|$|R
