40|$|For {{various reasons}} as {{discussed}} for instance in, {{the selection of}} <b>actuator</b> and <b>sensor</b> positions is still ad hoc. This {{is especially true for}} flexible structures where many candidate configurations can exist. This study is an attempt to make the selection process more methodical. One approach to <b>actuator</b> and <b>sensor</b> placement is to optimize a closed loop performance metric directly by selecting the <b>actuators,</b> <b>sensors,</b> and controller gains simultaneously. This direct approach makes sense if the desired closed loop performance is well defined. Since the individual <b>actuator</b> and <b>sensor</b> contributions to the closed loop performance metric is complex, the solution strategy usually employs non linear programming with many design and numerical iterations. A second approach is to select <b>actuators</b> and/or <b>sensors</b> based on open loop properties so that closed loop performance is indirectly optimized. Since the individual <b>sensor</b> and <b>actuator</b> contributions to the open loop metric is simple, nonlinear optimization is usually not needed. This approach will suggest efficient <b>actuator</b> and <b>sensor</b> configurations for any type of control law. The method suggested in this study falls into the latter class of approaches...|$|R

It is shown that the problem {{can be reduced to}} analysis of the nonstationarity degree of NCS. The degradation degree is calculated in frequency domain using SVD-DFT transformation of system operator defined on finite time horizon.

40|$|AbstractWe {{study the}} problem of <b>actuator</b> and <b>sensor</b> {{placement}} in a linear advection partial differential equation (PDE). The problem is motivated by its application to <b>actuator</b> and <b>sensor</b> placement in building systems for the control and detection of a scalar quantity such as temperature and contaminants. We propose a gramian based approach to {{the problem of}} <b>actuator</b> and <b>sensor</b> placement. The special structure of the advection PDE is exploited to provide an explicit formula for the controllability and observability gramian {{in the form of a}} multiplication operator. The explicit formula for the gramian, as a function of <b>actuator</b> and <b>sensor</b> location, is used to provide test criteria for the suitability of a given <b>sensor</b> and <b>actuator</b> location. Furthermore, the solution obtained using gramian based criteria is interpreted in terms of the flow of the advective vector field. In particular, the almost everywhere stability property of the advective vector field is shown to play a crucial role in deciding the location of <b>actuators</b> and <b>sensors.</b> Simulation results are performed to support the main results of this paper...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Intelligent environments {{are based}} on {{services}} that are deployed on hardware nodes that communicate among each other. Generic and light-weight communication middleware for service interaction {{is the basis of}} the ubiquitous idea. <b>Actuator,</b> <b>sensor</b> and information systems as well multimedia devices are distributed over a set of hardware nodes. If service discovery, interaction paradigms, availability check, capability, and context description are already considered on the communication level, it is easier for service developers to implement robust, powerful and efficient applications. Learning from conventional embed-ded systems helps to understand the ambient view beginning at resource-constrained hardware and pragmatic communication paradigms. Naturally, embedded systems are already pervasive and ambient regarding service distribution, thus hiding the technology from the user. Interfaces are often only indirectly specified and the collaboration structure is static.
