40|$|Recently, Scholten and Read (2014) {{found new}} {{violations}} of dominance in intertemporal choice. Although <b>adding</b> <b>a</b> small receipt before a delayed payment or <b>adding</b> <b>a</b> small delayed receipt after an immediate receipt makes the prospect objectively better, it decreases {{the preference for}} that prospect (better is worse). Conversely, although <b>adding</b> <b>a</b> small payment before a delayed receipt or <b>adding</b> <b>a</b> small delayed payment after an immediate payment makes the prospect objectively worse, it increases the preference for that prospect (worse is better). Scholten and Read explained these violations {{in terms of a}} preference for improvement. However, to produce violations such as these, we find that the temporal sequences need not be constructed as Scholten and Read suggested. In this study, <b>adding</b> <b>a</b> small receipt before a dated receipt (thus constructed as improving) or <b>adding</b> <b>a</b> receipt after a dated payment (thus constructed as improving) decreases preferences for those prospects.
