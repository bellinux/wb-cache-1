5|$|A {{class action}} lawsuit, Cook v. Rockwell International Corp., was filed in January 1990 against Rockwell and Dow Chemical (due to the {{indemnity}} of nuclear contractors, the award {{would have been}} paid by the federal government). Sixteen years later, the plaintiffs were awarded $926 million in economic damages, punitive damages, and interest. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently threw out the verdict <b>and</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>a</b> retrial. A further appeal was rejected without comment by the United States Supreme Court in June 2012.|$|E

5|$|While Lafayette was {{returning}} to France, LouisXVIII died, and CharlesX took the throne. As king, Charles intended to restore the absolute rule of the monarch, and his decrees had already prompted protest by the time Lafayette arrived. Lafayette was {{the most prominent of}} those who opposed the king. In the elections of 1827, the 70-year-old Lafayette was elected to the Chamber of Deputies again. Unhappy at the outcome, Charles dissolved the Chamber, <b>and</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>a</b> new election: Lafayette again won his seat.|$|E
5|$|Fort Nieulay, {{located along}} the Avenue Roger Salengro {{originally}} dated to the 12th or 13th century. During the English invasion in 1346, sluices gates were added as water defences and a fort was built up around it in 1525 {{on the principle}} that the people of the fort could defend the town by flooding it. In April and May 1677, Louis XIV and Vauban visited Calais <b>and</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>a</b> complete rebuilding of Fort Nieulay. It was completed in 1679, with the purpose to protect the bridge of Nieulay crossing the Hames River. By 1815 the fort had fallen into a ruined state and it wasn't until 1903 that it was sold and improved by its farmer tenants. The fort was briefly the site of a low-key scuffle with Germans in May 1940.|$|E
5|$|French losses {{numbered}} 2,000 {{killed and}} wounded plus 400 captured. The Austrians suffered 1,300 killed and wounded with 1,300 captured. On 10 July, Charles evacuated Malsch <b>and</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>a</b> forced march east to Pforzheim via Karlsruhe. Also on the 10th, the French occupied Ettlingen and Neuenbürg. Anxious {{to protect his}} magazines at Heilbronn, Charles halted at Pforzheim for a few days. For his part, Moreau would not believe that Charles had given up, so he waited around Ettlingen for several days. Meanwhile, the Austrians packed their supplies into wagons and headed east on 14 July. The next day, Moreau moved on Pforzheim but found the archduke gone.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, Bure {{sued the}} Russian {{newspaper}} the eXile for publishing an article stating he {{broke up with}} Kournikova because she had two vaginas. Although the newspapers' editorial staff claimed the story was a mere joke, the court ruled in favour of Bure {{in the amount of}} 500,000 rubles (US$17,770), <b>and</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>a</b> retraction to be printed. Two years later, on December 27, 2004, the Russian cosmetics chain Arbat Prestige published a story in their free promotional paper that Bure had bragged about Kournikova losing her virginity to him. Shortly thereafter, on January 31, 2005, Bure sued Arbat Prestige for 300million rubles (US$10.65million) in a court in Moscow. He also demanded the company print a retraction and apology in a future paper. The court ruled in favour of Bure in November 2005. However, the amount was reduced from 300million to approximately 320,000 rubles.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} spring of 223 BC, Antigonus {{advanced}} upon Tegea. He was joined there by the Achaeans and together they laid siege to it. The Tegeans held {{out for a few}} days before being forced to surrender by the Macedonians' siege weapons. After the capture of Tegea, Antigonus advanced to Laconia, where he found Cleomenes' army waiting for him. When his scouts brought news that the garrison of Orchomenus was marching to meet Cleomenes, however, Antigonus broke camp <b>and</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>a</b> forced march; this caught the city by surprise and forced it to surrender. Antigonus proceeded to capture Mantinea, Heraea and Telphusa, which confined Cleomenes to Laconia. Antigonus then returned to Aegium, where he gave another report about his operations before dismissing the Macedonian troops to winter at home.|$|E
5|$|On 26 December 211, at a {{reconciliation}} meeting arranged by their mother, Caracalla had Geta assassinated {{by members of}} the Praetorian Guard loyal to himself, Geta dying in his mother's arms. Caracalla then persecuted and executed most of Geta's supporters <b>and</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>a</b> damnatio memoriae pronounced by the Senate against his brother's memory. Geta's image was removed from all paintings, coins were melted down, statues were destroyed, his name was struck from papyrus records, and it became a capital offence to speak or write Geta's name. In the aftermath of the damnatio memoriae, an estimated 20,000 people were massacred. Those killed were Geta's inner circle of guards and advisers, friends, and other military staff under his employ.|$|E

5|$|On 5 July 1943, the Germans {{launched}} the Battle of Kursk, an offensive designed {{to eliminate the}} Kursk salient. The Waffen-SS by this time had been expanded to 12 divisions, and most {{took part in the}} battle. Due to stiff Soviet resistance, Hitler halted the attack by the evening of 12 July. On 17 July he called off the operation <b>and</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>a</b> withdrawal. Thereafter, the Germans were forced onto the defensive as the Red Army began the liberation of Western Russia. The losses incurred by the Waffen-SS and the Wehrmacht during the Battle of Kursk occurred nearly simultaneously with the Allied assault into Italy, opening a two-front war for Germany.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 1940, the Yugoslav Supreme Command {{had issued}} {{orders to the}} 4th Army District {{headquarters}} to make all necessary preparations for defence and demolitions <b>and</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>a</b> 14-day exercise for border troops. 4th Army District headquarters submitted a progress report on this work on 30 January 1941. This report indicated that along the Hungarian border, bunkers and trenches had been constructed for the immediate defence of the Drava along the Yugoslav-Hungarian border, in particular at Varaždin, Koprivnica, Virovitica and Slatina, but no obstacles such as barbed wire entanglements or anti-tank ditches had been developed.|$|E
5|$|The Davis Cup {{was founded}} in 1900 as the International Lawn Tennis Challenge. Four members of Harvard University wished to {{challenge}} Great Britain in a tennis competition. One of the American players, Dwight F. Davis, designed a tournament format <b>and</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>a</b> sterling silver trophy from Shreve, Crump & Low for approximately $1,000. The first match, held at Longwood Cricket Club in Boston, Massachusetts, was won by the American team 3–0. There was no match the following year, but the United States retained the trophy in 1902, beating Great Britain 3–2. This was followed by four successive victories for Britain, from 1903 to 1906. The 1904 Davis Cup saw new teams compete for the first time, as Belgium and France entered.|$|E

5|$|The Germans {{were not}} able to hold Dijon <b>and</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>a</b> {{complete}} withdrawal from Southern France. Army GroupG retreated further north, pursued by Allied forces. The fighting ultimately came to a stop at the Vosges mountains, where Army GroupG was finally able to establish a stable defense line. After meeting with the Allied units from Operation Overlord, the Allied forces were in need of reorganizing and, facing stiffened German resistance, the offensive was halted on 14September. Operation Dragoon was considered a success by the Allies. It enabled them to liberate most of Southern France in a time span of only four weeks, while inflicting heavy casualties on the German forces, although a substantial part of the best German units was able to escape. The captured French ports were put into operation, allowing the Allies to solve their supply problems soon after.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} watch {{was issued}} for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands late on November15, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning six hours later. By that time, Lenny was projected to move over Puerto Rico. After Lenny made its closest {{approach to the}} island, the hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning on November17, which was discontinued the following day along with the advisories in the Virgin Islands. In Puerto Rico, the media maintained continuous coverage on the hurricane based on statements and warnings from the San Juan National Weather Service office. Based on the coverage, the public was well informed of the hurricane's threat to the island. Before the storm {{and as a result}} of its impact, around 4,700people evacuated to 191shelters. This included 1,190residents in Ponce who evacuated to 27schools, as well as 584people in western Puerto Rico. Officials closed all schools, banned the sale of alcohol, <b>and</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>a</b> freeze on the price of emergency supplies. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated six medical assistance teams, three medical support teams, and two advance medical assessment units. The agency stored five days' worth of food in schools in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Before the hurricane's arrival, U.S. Virgin Islands governor Charles Wesley Turnbull declared a state of emergency. In St. Croix, 309people rode out the storm in shelters. Officials opened eight shelters in the British Virgin Islands. There, airlines and hotels assisted in evacuating tourists from the area.|$|E
5|$|Astorias bridge crew called general {{quarters}} upon sighting the flares {{south of}} Savo, around 01:49. At 01:52, {{shortly after the}} Japanese searchlights came on and shells began falling around the ship, Astorias main gun director crews spotted the Japanese cruisers and opened fire. Astorias captain, awakened to find his ship in action, rushed to the bridge <b>and</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>a</b> ceasefire, fearful that his ship might be firing on friendly forces. As shells continued to cascade around his ship, the captain ordered firing resumed {{less than a minute}} later. Chōkai, however, had found the range, and Astoria was quickly hit by numerous shells and set afire. Between 02:00 and 02:15, Aoba, Kinugasa, and Kako joined Chōkai in pounding Astoria, destroying the cruiser's engine room and bringing the flaming ship to a halt. At 02:16, one of Astorias remaining operational main gun turrets fired at Kinugasas searchlight, but missed and hit Chōkais forward turret, putting the turret out of action and causing moderate damage to the ship.|$|E
