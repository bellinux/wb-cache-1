5|$|As {{with any}} theory, {{a number of}} mysteries <b>and</b> <b>problems</b> have arisen {{as a result of}} the {{development}} of the Big Bang theory. Some of these mysteries <b>and</b> <b>problems</b> have been resolved while others are still outstanding. Proposed solutions to some of the problems in the Big Bang model have revealed new mysteries of their own. For example, the horizon problem, the magnetic monopole problem, and the flatness problem are most commonly resolved with inflationary theory, but the details of the inflationary universe are still left unresolved and many, including some founders of the theory, say it has been disproven. What follows are a list of the mysterious aspects of the Big Bang theory still under intense investigation by cosmologists and astrophysicists.|$|E

In lie with Vision 2020 and Malaysian Education Blueprint (2013 - 2025) we {{need to create a}} generation equipped with thinking skills <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> solving skills. The objective of this research is to identify the ability of thinking skills <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> solving skills in Malay Language among primary school pupils in Peninsula Malaysia. This study employed a survey method whereby pupils are given a test to measure their thinking skills <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> solving skills. This test is developed by the researcher and based on de Bono's CoRT thinking tools. Pupils were asked to utilize their creativity to the maximum level while responding to questions related to thinking skills <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> solving skills. Pupils thinking skills are measured based on originality,appropriateness, <b>and</b> fluency. Their <b>problem</b> solving skills are measured based on appropriateness and novelty. The findings indicate that the thinking skills <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> solving skills of rural pupils are significantly higher than the urban pupils. Besides that, the thinking skills <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> solving skills of female pupils are significantly higher compared to their male counter parts. This study concludes that de Bono's thinking tools can be used as an alternative to enhance pupils' thinking skills <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> solving skills...|$|R
40|$|Outline of the LLLP What is the LLLP? Launched in 2006 the LLLP is a five age cohort, four data {{collection}} wave longitudinal study that examines the incidence and determinants of gambling <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> gambling.

What bio-psychological variables and behavior patterns are most predictive of current and future responsible <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> gambling? 3. Are there distinct sub-groupings of gamblers <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> gamblers with different trajectories and predictors? 4. What etiological model of problem gambling is best supported by the longitudinal findings...|$|R
40|$|A major {{difficulty}} in restructuring compilation and in parallel programming {{in general is}} how to compare parallel performance over a range of system <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> sizes. Execution time varies with system <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> size, <b>and</b> an initially fast implementation may become slow when system <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> size scale up. This paper introduces the concept of range comparison. Unlike conventional execution time comparison in which performance is compared for a particular system <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> size, range comparison compares the performance of programs over a range of ensemble <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> sizes via scalability and performance crossing point analysis. A novel algorithm is developed to predict the crossing point automatically. The correctness of the algorithm is proved and a methodology is developed to integrate range comparison into restructuring compilations for data-parallel programming. A preliminary prototype of the methodology is implemented and tested under Vienna Fortran Compilation System. Exper [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} based on a {{descriptive}} study using survey method and focus group interviews. Thinking skills <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> solving skills are vital for pupils in their daily lives and facing their future challenges. Therefore, parents and teachers {{play an important role in}} nurturing these skills among pupils. The objective of the study is to explore parents’ and teachers’ views of pupils’ thinking skills <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> solving skills according to locations of the school (urban and rural). This study also explores parents’ and teachers’ suggestions to enhance pupils’ thinking skills <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> solving skills. The sample consists of 302 parents of the pupils and 104 teachers who are teaching Year 4, Year 5 and Year 6. The quantitative data for the research was collected using questionnaires which were developed by the researchers. Each set of questionnaire consists of 23 items. While the qualitative data was collected through the focus group interview method among parents and teachers to get their suggestions on how to enhance pupils’ thinking skills <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> solving skills. The findings show that the urban parents’ views of children’s thinking skills <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> solving skills is significantly higher than those from the rural. The results also indicate that there is no significant difference between the urban school teachers’ and the rural school teachers’ views of pupils’ thinking skills <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> solving skills. Findings from the focus group interviews show that most parents engage their children in hands on activities at home to enhance their thinking skills <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> solving skills. On the other hand, teachers encourage active participation of pupils in co-curricular activities to enhance pupils’ thinking skills <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> solving skills...|$|R

5|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of Mario, Naka wanted Sonic {{to take over the}} American market. Sonic's default speed was set to that of Mario while running. Tests were run using the Genesis' tool library, <b>and</b> <b>problems</b> such as flickering, slow frame rates, and shaky animation soon became apparent. Increasing Sonic's speed caused animation problems. Naka solved the problem by developing an algorithm that enabled the animation to retain fluidity. Sonic was able to cross levels quickly without the animation slowing down, and all that was left was the optimization of the game's speed to adhere to the staff's expectations. The team then noticed that different people had different perceptions of the game's speed: some believed it was too fast, which caused disagreements. As a result, the game was slowed down.|$|E

40|$|Individuals {{suffering}} from ADHD tend to develop various ADHD-related problems over time. Possibly the Early Maladaptive Schema’s {{as defined by}} Jeffrey Young {{play a role in}} this accumulation of problems. Therefore the relationships between these schema’s <b>and</b> ADHD-related <b>problems</b> were investigated in a non-clinical sample of students (N= 141) of a medical pedagogical and didactical centrum, aged 12 - 16 years. ADHD-related problems were divided into ADHD symptoms (Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity <b>Problems</b> <b>and</b> Attention <b>Problems),</b> <b>and</b> externalising <b>problems</b> (Externalising, Rule-Breaking Behaviour, Aggressive Behaviour, Oppositional Defiant <b>Problems,</b> <b>and</b> Conduct <b>Problems).</b> First, a correlational analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between the schema’s <b>and</b> ADHD-related <b>problems.</b> Thereafter multiple regression analyses were conducted to further investigate the found relationships. Insufficient Self-Control explained most of the variance in ADHD symptoms <b>and</b> externalising <b>problems.</b> For externalising problems, Enmeshment proved to be an import predictor as well. This schema had a protective effect onExternalising,Rule-Breaking Behaviour <b>and</b> Oppositional Defiant <b>Problems.</b> Overall, the results showthat there is indeed a meaningful relation between schema’s <b>and</b> ADHD-related <b>problems,</b> suggesting schema’s mayindeed {{play an important role in}} the course of ADHD <b>and</b> related <b>problems...</b>|$|R

5|$|Good {{conformation}} in {{the limbs}} leads to improved movement and decreased likelihood of injuries. Large differences in bone structure and size {{can be found}} in horses used for different activities, but correct conformation remains relatively similar across the spectrum. Structural defects, as well as other problems such as injuries and infections, can cause lameness, or movement at an abnormal gait. Injuries to <b>and</b> <b>problems</b> with horse legs can be relatively minor, such as stocking up, which causes swelling without lameness, or quite serious. Even non-fatal leg injuries can be fatal to horses, as their bodies are designed to bear weight on all four legs and serious problems can result if this is not possible.|$|E

40|$|Cross-sectionally, {{social norms}} {{are related to}} heavy <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> {{drinking}} in late adolescence. A better understanding is needed regarding the longitudinal associations between social norms in younger populations <b>and</b> heavy <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> drinking over time. This study distinguished between descriptive (proximal reference group) and injunctive norms (proximal and distal reference groups). This study evaluated the perception of social norms in youngsters during early adolescence (13 - 15 years) and the contribution of these norms to heavy <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> drinking over a 4 -year period. Adolescents (N = 428; 205 boys) participated in a prospective study with 5 annual waves. Regression {{analyses were conducted to}} examine whether descriptive and injunctive norms prospectively predict heavy <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> drinking. Descriptive <b>and</b> injunctive norms of the proximal, but not the distal reference group, predicted heavy drinking in late adolescence. Descriptive norms of the proximal reference group also predicted problem drinking in late adolescence. This study demonstrates the role of social norms in the prediction of heavy <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> drinking over time. Additionally, it illustrates the contribution of proximal rather than distal reference peers to heavy <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> drinking in late adolescence, and it suggests the relevance of targeting these norms in prevention research.
