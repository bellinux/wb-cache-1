40|$|An asteroidal {{occultation}} of a 8. 5 V magnitude star can {{be difficult}} to be observed without an <b>automatic</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>system.</b> It was the case of 474 Prudentia occulting HIP 1927 on 5 September 2010, observed from the center of Rome. The solution of pre-pointing the telescope to Jupiter and leaving it fixed for 20 m 30 s, allowed to have the correct field of view and to observe successfully the phenomenon. This was possible because Jupiter was at the same declination of the target star, and 20 m 30 s of right ascension to the west of it. With opportune modifications this method can be applied in similar cases, when the observing equipment is minimal. In that case, for example, many observers could have been witness of such an event, helping to recover the shadow path across the city. Comment: 2 pages, 3 figures.

40|$|ITT Industries Space Systems Division (Space Systems) has {{developed}} an airborne natural gas leak detection system designed to detect, image, quantify, and precisely locate leaks from natural gas transmission pipelines. This system is called the Airborne Natural Gas Emission Lidar (ANGEL) system. The ANGEL system uses a highly sensitive differential absorption Lidar technology to remotely detect pipeline leaks. The ANGEL System is operated from a fixed wing aircraft and includes <b>automatic</b> scanning, <b>pointing</b> <b>system,</b> and pilot guidance systems. During a pipeline inspection, the ANGEL system aircraft flies at an elevation of 1000 {{feet above the ground}} at speeds of between 100 and 150 mph. Under this contract with DOE/NETL, Space Systems was funded to integrate the ANGEL sensor into a test aircraft and conduct a series of flight tests over a variety of test targets including simulated natural gas pipeline leaks. Following early tests in upstate New York in the summer of 2004, the ANGEL system was deployed to Casper, Wyoming to participate in a set of DOE-sponsored field tests at the Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center (RMOTC). At RMOTC the Space Systems team completed integration of the system and flew an operational system for the first time. The ANGEL system flew 2 missions/day for the duration for the 5 -day test. Over the course of the week the ANGEL System detected leaks ranging from 100 to 5, 000 scfh...|$|R

THF was distilled over sodium/benzophenone, Et 2 O was dried over neatly cut sodium and dichloromethane was dried over 3 Å molecular sieves. All solvents were tested for water content using a Karl Fisher apparatus. All reactions involving dry solvents or sensitive agents were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere, and glassware was dried prior to use. All reactions were monitored by analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC, Merck silica gel 60 F 254 aluminum sheets). Flash chromatography {{was carried out}} using Merck silica gel 60 A (35 - 70 micron). 1 H NMR spectra were recorded on a 300 MHz Varian Mercury 300 BB or a 400 MHz Avance Bruker and 13 C NMR spectra on a 75 MHz Varian Gemini 2000 BB or a 100 MHz Avance Bruker. Preparative HPLC was done using Agilent Prep HPLC systems with Agilent 1100 series pump, Agilent 1200 series diode array, multiple wavelength detector (G 1365 B), and Agilent PrepHT High Performance Preparative Cartridge Column (Zorbax, 300 SB-C 18 Prep HT, 21.2 × 250 mm, 7 μ m). LC-MS spectra were recorded using an Agilent 1200 series solvent delivery system equipped with an autoinjector coupled to an Agilent 6400 series triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source. Gradients of 5 % aqueous MeCN + 0.05 % HCOOH (eluent A), and 95 % aqueous MeCN + 0.043 % formic acid (eluent B) were employed.

These procedures include personnel training, database management, cleaning equipment, blank sampling, concurrent point and cross-section sampling, concurrent replicate samples, and split replicate samples. The U. S.

In order to obtain a representative sample during a storm, it is preferable to collect samples using the EWI method. This method collects several points along the stream cross section and at {{several times during the}} storm hydrograph. Because of the large labor requirements and difficulty in sampling storm flows consistently, EWI samples are often not practical; an alternative is to obtain a composite sample that represents the entire hydrograph using an <b>automatic</b> <b>point</b> sampler.

40|$|Various {{kinds of}} demerit <b>point</b> <b>systems</b> have been {{developed}} and implemented in European countries, aimed at tackling repeat offences in road transport by acting as a deterrent and providing sanctioning. The impact of a demerit <b>point</b> <b>system</b> {{on the number of}} crashes is often reported to be significant, but temporary. The objective of the EU BestPoint project was to establish a set of recommended practices that would result in a more effective and sustainable contribution of demerit <b>point</b> <b>systems</b> to road safety. A high actual chance of losing the licence and a high perceived chance of losing the licence are basic prerequisites for the effective operation of demerit <b>point</b> <b>systems.</b> For measures applied {{within the context of a}} demerit <b>point</b> <b>system,</b> a four-step-approach is recommended: warning letter, driver improvement course, licence withdrawal, rehabilitation course. Further recommendations concern issues like points and offences, e. g. which offences should lead to points, target groups, and the administration of demerit <b>point</b> <b>systems.</b> The final result of the EU BestPoint project is a handbook (van Schagen & Machata, 2012) which provides a concise overview of all recommended practices.

40|$|Demerit <b>points</b> <b>systems</b> in Europe: {{room for}} improvement; Some {{recommendations}} from the European project BestPoint. Broadly speaking, a demerit <b>points</b> <b>system</b> involves a road user receiving demerit points {{in addition to}} the regular punishment when a traffic violation has been observed. If someone has received a certain number of demerit points within a certain period of time, the driver’s licence will be temporarily suspended. Demerit <b>points</b> <b>systems</b> aim at regular offenders and for this reason they are generally considered to be fair. This may be the explanation for their considerable popularity. Three quarters of the European Member States use some form of demerit <b>points</b> <b>system.</b> At present, the Netherlands has a simple variant which only applies to novice drivers. Recently, the European project BestPoint has concluded a two-year study into demerit <b>points</b> <b>systems</b> which resulted in a handbook for governments who are considering to implement a demerit <b>points</b> <b>system.</b> BestPoint investigated the actual effectiveness of a demerit <b>points</b> <b>system</b> and which type of system may be expected to be the most satisfactory. The most important conclusion is that demerit <b>points</b> <b>systems</b> are less effective than their popularity in Europe suggests. Initially, they have a considerable road safety effect, but their deterrence often is only short-lasting. However, the effectiveness of a demerit <b>points</b> <b>system</b> may be improved by setting it up in a good way; {{it is very important that}} both the objective and the subjective risk of being caught remain high and that automatically detected offences are also included...|$|R
