40|$|The air-start {{capability}} of a secondary engine control (SEC) was tested for a DEEC-equipped F 100 engine and installed in an F- 15 airplane. Two air-start schedules were tested. The first {{was referred to}} as the group I schedule; the second or revised schedule was the group II start schedule. Using the group I start schedule, an airspeed of 300 knots was required to ensure successful 40 - and 25 -percent SEC-mode <b>air</b> <b>starts.</b> If N 2 were less than 40 percent, a stall would occur when the start bleeds closed 40 sec after initiation of the <b>air</b> <b>start.</b> All JFS-assisted <b>air</b> <b>starts</b> were successful with the group start schedule. For the group II schedule, the time between pressurization and start-bleed closure ranged between 50 and 72 sec depending on altitude. All <b>air</b> <b>starts</b> were successful above 225 knots givin a 75 -knot reduction in required airspeed for a successful <b>air</b> <b>start.</b> Spooldown <b>air</b> <b>starts</b> of 40 percent were successful at 200 knots at altitudes up to 10, 650 m and at 175 knots at altitudes up to 6100 m. Idle rpm was lower than the desired 65 percent for <b>air</b> <b>starts</b> at higher altitudes and lower airspeeds. All JSF-assisted <b>air</b> <b>starts</b> were successful...|$|R
40|$|The <b>air</b> <b>start</b> {{capability}} of a backup control (BUC) was tested for a digital {{electronic engine control}} (DEEC) equipped F 100 engine, which was installed in an F- 15 aircraft. Two <b>air</b> <b>start</b> schedules were tested. Using the group 1 start schedule, based on a 40 sec timer, an air speed of 300 knots was required to ensure successful 40 and 25 % BUC mode spooldown airstarts. If core rotor speed (N 2) was less than 40 % a stall would occur when the start bleed closed, 40 sec after initiation of the <b>air</b> <b>start.</b> All jet fuel starter (JFS) assisted <b>air</b> <b>starts</b> were successful with the group 1 start schedule. For the group 2 schedule, the time between pressurization and start bleed closure ranged between 50 sec and 72 sec.

40|$|The digital {{electronic}} {{engine control}} (DEEC) system installed on an F 100 engine in an F- 15 aircraft was tested. The DEEC system incorporates a closed-loop <b>air</b> <b>start</b> feature in which the fuel flow is modulated to achieve the desired rate of compressor acceleration. With this logic the DEEC equipped F 100 engine can achieve <b>air</b> <b>starts</b> over a larger envelope. The DEEC <b>air</b> <b>start</b> logic, the test program conducted on the F- 15, and its results are described...|$|R

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>start</b> {{units are}} an {{invaluable}} piece of aviation common support equipment (CSE) which provide primary, secondary, and ground maintenance start capability for Navy and Marine Corps aircraft. In those weapon platforms without auxiliary power units (APUs), <b>air</b> <b>start</b> units {{are the only}} source of starting the aircraft's powerful turbine engines. If the <b>air</b> <b>start</b> unit fails, there will be no chance of the getting the aircraft airborne to perform its intended mission. Today the Huffer and its GTCP 100 - 82 engine, which is housed in both a shore based and carrier configuration, is the Navy and Marine Corps' primary <b>air</b> <b>start</b> unit. Current operational Huffers range from 10 to 30 years old, and must be overhauled every 3 years at the depot level.

50|$|The NTSB report {{indicates}} that the ground handlers did not properly close the <b>air</b> <b>start</b> access door due to a sudden change in their procedure when the ground handler supervisor realized that the headset being used {{to communicate with the}} flightcrew was nonfunctional, and had to revert mid-routine to using hand signals. This break in routine led the supervisor to signal the flight to taxi before the <b>air</b> <b>start</b> hose was disconnected. Although he then realized that the hose was still connected and signaled the flight crew for an emergency stop, and the hose was successfully disconnected, the closing of the <b>air</b> <b>start</b> access door was not completed either prior to the supervisor's initial go-ahead or after the emergency stop.|$|R
