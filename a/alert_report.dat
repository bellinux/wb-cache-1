40|$|Abstract: The massive {{jumps in}} {{technology}} {{led to the}} expansion of Cloud Computing as the most accepted medium for communication but it has also increased the scope of attacks as well. So security has become a major issue for Cloud Computing. In this paper we proposed a single IDS Controller creating and managing multiple instances for each user. A multithreaded NIDS protects the cloud efficiently and avoids the traffic congestion for large volume of data. In order to detect encrypted and fragmented data, HIDS is also deployed in the hypervisor for detailed monitoring over Server. Analyzing all the alerts, IDS Controller generates a final report to Cloud Service Provide and an <b>alert</b> <b>report</b> to the cloud user {{with the help of a}} Third Party monitoring and advisory service. Our proposed model provides a virtualized environment to protect the Cloud efficiently from vulnerabilities...|$|E

This approach reduces the amount of false alerts (false positives) and raises the quality of the <b>alert</b> <b>report.</b> A sample data over the Christmas period of year 2002 is analyzed as an example and detection of unauthorized SSH servers used as the main application. Unauthorized interactive backdoors to a network belong to the most dangerous class of intrusions [1]. These backdoors are usually installed by root-kits, to hide the system compromise activity. They are a gateway to launch exploits, gain super-user access to hosts in the internal network and to use the attacked network as a stepping stone to attack other networks. In this research we have developed software and done statistical analysis to assess and prevent such situations. Intrusion detection, automation, alarm filtering I...|$|E
40|$|More {{information}} about PSE and the G-MonD: www. parisschoolofeconomics. eu The 2010 Global Trade <b>Alert</b> <b>Report</b> identified China’s system of Value Added Tax (VAT) rebates for exporters {{as the most}} important discriminatory state measure in terms of trade covered during the recent crisis (Global Trade Alert, 2010). The charge may seem surprising insofar as China, contrary to most countries with a VAT system, does not fully rebate the VAT on exports. Instead, exporters may receive VAT rebates that vary across commodities, and range from zero to the full refund of the typical 17 % VAT rate. The Chinese VAT system thus imposes a tax on exporters whose goods receive a VAT refund rate lower than the applicable VAT rate. Two features have been highlighted as evidence that this VAT rebate system is nevertheless a systematic form of export management, providing Chinese exporters with an advantage with respect to foreign competitors. First, there is tremendous variation across goods in the levels of and changes to the VAT rebates...|$|E

March with Sergej Olenin as host and Henn Ojaveer as chair. The meeting was {{attended}} by partic-ipants from 22 countries. The physical participants were from Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Sweden, Ukraine and United Kingdom while United States participated over Skype and Croatia, Israel, Poland and Spain contrib-uted by correspondence. The meeting was also attended by the EU and CIESM repre-sentative. It was the 40 th meeting of this expert group. The objectives of the meeting were to update information and discuss several aspects related {{to the introduction of}} alien species. The meeting dealt in more details with the ‘Information system on aquatic non-indigenous and cryptogenic species’ (AquaNIS) and whether/how to use this platform to further reporting to WGITMO purposes, fouling of artificial structures by alien species, how to better address emerging ICES strategic topics (climate impacts, Arctic research) and cooperation with CIESM and PICES. Importantly, the group also dedicated time for addressing the MSFD D 2 is-sues and finalized the species <b>alert</b> <b>report</b> on Ensis directus. As usual, sufficient time was devoted to presentations of national reports and exchange of knowledge and information (e. g. with the Mediterranean Sea and the Ponto-Caspian region). The approach taken during the meeting facilitated presentations and discussions on the issues of relevance related to the Terms of References, but also a few generic and strategically important issues relevant to bioinvasions in general. The meeting started as a full-day joint meeting with the Working Group on Ballast and Other Ship Vec-tors (WGBOSV) during which issues of common interest were addressed. For the next meeting, the joint meeting is also planned to last one full day. For some Terms of Reference a more detailed presentation was given during the meeting and a short overview of the information and subsequent discussion is pro-vided in the report {{at the end of each}} section. The report is structured so that each Term of Reference is dealt with in sequential order. The main body of the report con-tains summaries of the presentations and discussions with the more detailed docu-ments being contained in the Annexes. The group progressed in each of the Term of Reference by either completing the task or clearly identifying and agreeing on the intersessional activities required to finalize the work. Intersessional work is inherently an integral component of future work for WGITMO. To share the workload, several group members were asked to lead some specific tasks. WGITMO suggests AquaNIS to substitute the present data-reporting format (xls file) and to be used beginning 2015 as an online reporting platform for new species inva-sions and secondary spread of already existing invasions in ICES countries and else-where (e. g. CIESM and PICES regions) ...|$|E

Representatives from 19 {{countries}} participated in the meeting. Attendants were from Belgium, Canada, Dennark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States. Sweden contributed by cor-respondence. The objectives of the meeting were to update information and discuss several aspects related to the introductions and transfers of non-indigenous aquatic species. Data and information management {{were two of the}} discussion topics of the meeting, with special focus on the better exploitation of the ‘Information system on aquatic non-indigenous and cryptogenic species’ (AquaNIS). The WGITMO also dedicated time for addressing the MSFD D 2 issues: indicator on new non-indigenous species introduced by human activities, and opportunities and problems related to cross-regional comparison of non-indigenous species indicators. Preparation of the manuscript of the <b>alert</b> <b>report</b> on sea squirt Didemnum vexillum, which is to be published in ICES CRR series, was discussed and the steps to be taken to finalise the report were agreed. As usual, adequate time was devoted to discuss national reports, to exchange of information on the management of NIS and to review ongoing and planned research activities. The approach taken during the meeting facilitated presentations and discussions on the issues of relevance related to the Terms of References as well as on a few generic and strategically-important issues of general relevance to bioinvasions. The meeting began with a full-day joint meeting with the Working Group on Ballast and Other Ship Vectors (WGBOSV), which provided an opportunity to discuss and address issues of common interest, such as shipping and biofouling as introduction vectors. The proposed ICES demonstration advice on ‘Risk management of non-indigenous species associated with shipping in the Arctic’ was discussed, and edits were suggested for both the orientation of the demonstration advice {{as well as for the}} exact questions to be asked. Both working groups agreed that the practice of conducting back-to-back meetings with one joint day is useful and will continue in 2017. All Terms of References to be addressed for 2016 were discussed. For some Terms of Ref-erence, more detailed presentations were given, and a short overview of the information and subsequent discussion is provided herein at the end of each section. This report is structured so that each Term of Reference is dealt with in sequential order. The main body of the report contains summaries of the presentations and discussions with the more detailed documents being contained in the Annexes.

40|$|The 43 rd {{meeting of}} the ICES Working Group on Introductions and Transfers of Marine Organisms (WGITMO) {{was held at the}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-tion (NOAA) Northeast Fisheries Sciences Center in Woods Hole, USA, on 13 – 15 March 2017. This meeting {{included}} a joint day with the Working Group on Ballast Water and Other Ship Vectors (WGBOSV). The meeting was hosted by Judy Pederson (USA) and chaired by Cynthia McKenzie (Canada). The meeting was attended by 23 scientists in person, two by web-conference and five by correspondence, representing 16 countries; four additional scientists attended on the joint meeting day. The objective of the meeting was to communicate new information and discuss several aspects of the introductions and transfers of marine organisms relevant to the six terms of reference for the working group. There was a particular focus on introductions into the Arctic environment, bio-fouling of vessels and structures, and developing indicators to evaluate impact of non-indigenous species in marine environments. This year’s interim report provides: a summary of the 16 National Reports (reports at-tached in Annex 4); the 20 presentations provided by members and chair invited mem-bers in support of term of reference objectives (abstracts provided in Annex 5); discussions, achievements, limitations and a recommendation. All Terms of Reference were discussed with this report structured so that each Term of Reference is dealt with in sequential order. The National Reports provide an overview of the priorities, findings, meetings and publications for each country. In addition, it provides discussion points for methodologies, collaborations and knowledge gaps {{that need to be addressed}} by the group (ToR a). The AquaNIS database continues to be updated and the data is now georeferenced. There were three additional presentations under this term of reference addressing monitoring methodology and an invasion risk assessment tool. WGITMO considered two ToRs jointly with WGBOSV: examining the effect of climate change on the establishment of aquatic species in the Arctic (ToR b); and examining bio-fouling as vector for the introduction and transfer of aquatic organisms on vessels and structures (ToR c). An update was provided on an ongoing initiative to address De-scriptor 2 of the EU-MSFD, in particular Indicator 2. 2. 1 regarding impact of Invasive Al-ien Species (IAS) on marine environments (ToR d). The final goal is to develop a new indicator of impact that can be proposed for the implementation within the Marine Strat-egy Framework Directive. Two ICES Cooperative Research Reports developed by WGITMO were recently released. One was an alien species <b>alert</b> <b>report</b> on the invasive tunicate Didemnum vexillum and the other summarized the status of non-indigenous ma-rine species in the North Atlantic and adjacent waters 2003 – 2007 (ToR a). An update was provided on communications regarding the Suez Canal enlargement and bioinvasion problems in the Mediterranean Sea. A theme session for the 2017 ICES ASC on bioinvasion trajectories and impacts in con-trasting marine environments was proposed by WGITMO as collaboration between IC-ES-PICES-CIESM. The proposal was accepted and will be jointly chaired by representatives of the three groups...|$|E
40|$|The 2015 {{meeting of}} the ICES Working Group on Introductions and Transfers of Marine Organisms (WGITMO) was held in Bergen, Norway on 18 – 20 March with Anders Jelmert as host and Henn Ojaveer as chair. Fourteen {{countries}} participated in the meeting. At-tendants were from Belgium, Canada, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Lithua-nia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States. Greece, Ireland, Spain and Denmark contributed by correspondence. The meeting was also at-tended by the JRC representative. It was the 41 th meeting of this expert group. The objectives of the meeting were to update information and discuss several aspects re-lated to the introductions and transfers of non-indigenous species. Data and information management was {{a key component of}} the meeting with a special focus on the applica-tionof the ‘Information system on aquatic non-indigenous and cryptogenic species’ (AquaNIS) to support WGITMO mandate. These included issues such as: i) fouling of artificial structures by non-indigenous species, ii) how to better address emerging ICES strategic topics (climate impacts, Arctic research) and iii) internal cooperation in ICES (WGBOSV, WGAQUA, WGIMT). The group also dedicated time for addressing the MSFD D 2 issues and discussed these in relation to data availability and management im-plications for NIS in marine ecosystems. Another alien species <b>alert</b> <b>report</b> was published in ICES CRR series (see: Gollasch, S. et al. 2015. Alien Species Alert: Ensis directus. Current status of invasions by the marine bivalve Ensis directus. ICES Cooperative Research Re-port No. 323. 32 pp.). The outline for the new report onthe sea squirt Didemnum vexillum, was developed during the meeting. The group also reviewed OSPAR JAMP Eutrophica-tion Guidelines on phytoplankton species composition and developed advice related to non-indigenous phytoplankton species. As usual, appropriate time was devoted to dis-cuss national reports, exchange of information on the management of NIS and review of research activities. The approach taken during the meeting facilitated presentations and discussions on the issues of relevance related to the Terms of References, but also a few generic and strategi-cally important issues relevant to the theme of bioinvasions in general. The meeting started with a full-day joint meeting with the Working Group on Ballast and Other Ship Vectors (WGBOSV) to provide an opportunity to discuss and address issues of common interest. It was also agreed that this practice of conducting back to back meetings with one joint day will continue in 2016. All Terms of References identified for 2015 were discussed.
