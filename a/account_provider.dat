If the balance exceeds the agreed facility then fees may be charged and a higher interest rate might apply.|$|E

Some fees are set by the merchant <b>account</b> <b>provider,</b> but the majority of the per-item and percentage fees are passed through the merchant <b>account</b> <b>provider</b> to the credit card issuing bank according to a schedule of rates called interchange fees, which are set by Visa, Discover, and MasterCard.

50|$|In the mid-1990s, {{numerous}} universities provided dial-up shell accounts (to their faculty, staff, and students).

5000|$|This {{decomposition}} {{of the rights}} organised by Article 8 of the UCC results in preventing the investor to rivindicate the security in case of bankruptcy of the <b>account</b> <b>provider,</b> {{that is to say}} the possibility to claim the security as its own asset, without being obliged to share it at its prorate value with the other creditors of the <b>account</b> <b>provider.</b> As a consequence, it also prevents the investor, to assert its securities at the upper level of the holding chain, either up to the DTC or up to a sub-custodian. Such a [...] "security entitlement", unlike a normal ownership right, is no longer enforceable [...] "erga omnes" [...] to any person supposed to have the security in its custody. The [...] "security entitlement" [...] is a mere relative right, therefore a contractual right. Furthermore, this re-characterisation of the proprietary right into a simple contractual right enables the <b>account</b> <b>provider,</b> to [...] "re-use" [...] the security without necessarily being obliged to ask for the authorisation of the investor, in particular within the framework of temporary operations such as security lending, option to repurchase, buy to sell back or repurchase agreement.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} outsourcing of accounting. This thesis emphasizes on understanding of outsourcing in general {{as a concept}} {{as well as a}} procedure, in which the relationship between the client and the <b>accounting</b> services <b>provider</b> is created. The present experience leads us to a situation, where {{there are a lot of}} <b>accounting</b> services <b>providers</b> on the market. An enviroment with high competition is estabilished and the accounting firms have to react with better services and perks, so they can obtain and sustain the competitive advantage against others. A lot of big corporations resort to dealing with the accounting internally. On the other hand the enterprenurial environment from the look of the outsourcing provider is enriched by the establishment of many new smaller firms and start-ups, which are more likely to use the benefits of outsourcing of <b>accounting.</b> The <b>providers</b> can obtain a competitive advantage by improving the services through internal processes, employee management or by providing the extra services like bank payments, issuing invoices, etc. The goal of this thesis is to provide the reader with some introduction to outsourcing of accounting from the stance of the <b>accounting</b> services <b>provider,</b> from corporation establishment to accounting of the single clients...|$|R
