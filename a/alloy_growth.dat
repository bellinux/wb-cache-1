30|$|We {{have shown}} that thick, short-period AlN/GaN SL growth on (0001)-oriented {{sapphire}} substrates can be achieved without cracking {{by the introduction of}} a strain-compensating layer before the growth. This, unfortunately, comes at the expense of having to introduce a significant density of threading dislocations in the system. Since these dislocations are directly related {{to the quality of the}} AlN on sapphire growth, these may be avoidable by using thicker AlN templates as starting surfaces. One advantage of this technique, however, is that it uses films of stoichiometric AlN and GaN separately to form the strained growth surface.

Diffraction patterns reveal that Ge deposited on Si results in a Stranski-Krastanow growth mode with a change in surface reconstruction in the two-dimensional (2 D) regime from the two-domain Si(001) -(2 × 1) to a two-domain Si(2 × 8) -Ge, prior to the onset of three-dimensional (3 D) growth. Using the RHEED intensity oscillation technique during <b>alloy</b> <b>growth</b> it is found that at substrate temperatures below 600 °C there is an enhancement in growth rate of the alloy above that of pure Si growth from disilane. This phenomenon has been attributed to the increased desorption rate of hydrogen adatoms due to the presence of Ge, which leads to an acceleration of the heterogenous reaction rate. Consistent with this, during growth at substrate temperatures above the desorption rate maximum for hydrogen, 600 °C no enhancement of the growth rate due to the addition of GeH 4 to the beam flux is observed and the growth rate is dependent upon disilane arrival rate. Reaction kinetics are discussed in terms of Ge concentration in the films and the ratio of GeH 4 to Si 2 H 6 in the incident beams under various growth conditions. © 1993. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Direct <b>alloy</b> <b>growth</b> (DAG) of (Hg,Mn) Te on buffered GaAs and unbuffered (Cd,Zn) Te substrates in a horizontal MOVPE reactor resulted in poor surface compositional and thickness uniformity. This was attributed to the differences in the pyrolysis rates of the Te and Mn precursors. Double crystal x-ray diffraction was used to determine accurately layer thickness, composition and quality. Analysis of the symmetric and asymmetric rocking curves revealed that for thickness over lµm (Hg,Mn) Te was almost 100 % relaxed. A reduction in the dislocation density, as inferred from the x-ray rocking curve width, was observed with increasing layer thickness and was considered in terms of the Gay model. A sub-grain structure was seen using double crystal x-ray topography, where grain diameter decreased in a linear manner with inverse layer thickness. Triple axis x- ray diffraction revealed that tilts between the sub-grains were the primary cause of the rocking curve broadening. Hall and resistivity measurements were made in the temperature range 4 K to 290 K. The majority of the layers exhibited n-type behaviour, with carrier concentrations and mobilities dependent on layer thickness. Modelling of the temperature dependence of the carrier mobility was attempted for various lattice and impurity scattering mechanisms. Attempts were also made to explain the temperature dependence of the carrier concentration using a two band model and estimates for the bandgaps obtained from intrinsic Hall data. The interdiffused multilayer process (IMP) was then employed, resulting in layers with superior lateral compositional and thickness uniformities. Improved crystalline quality to that seen in comparable DAG layers was also obtained. The electron mobilities were higher in IMP lasers than incomparable DAG ones and analysis of the mobility data indicated that several scattering mechanisms were operative, including ionised and neutral impurity, optical phonon and piezoelectric (in Mn rich layers) scattering.

40|$|GaInAsSb is a {{promising}} material for mid-infrared {{devices such as}} lasers and detectors because it is a direct band gap material with large radiative coefficient and a cut-off wavelength that can be varied across the mid-infrared (from 1. 7 to 4. 9 μm) while remaining lattice matched to GaSb. On the other hand, the potential of the alloy is hampered by predicted ranges of concentration where the constituents of the alloy become immiscible when the crystal is grown near thermodynamic equilibrium at typical growth temperatures. There have been efforts to extend the wavelength of GaInAsSb alloys through such techniques as digital <b>alloy</b> <b>growth</b> and non-equilibrium growth, but most of the compositional range has for a long time been inaccessible due to immiscibility challenges. Theoretical studies also supported the existence of thermodynamic immiscibility gaps for non-equilibrium growth conditions. Lower growth temperatures lead to shorther adatom diffusion length. While a shorter adatom diffusion length suppresses phase separation, too short an adatom length is associated with increased defect formation and eventually loss of crystallinity. On the other hand, hotter growth temperatures move epitaxial growth closer to thermodynamic equilib- rium conditions, and will eventually cause phase separation to occur. In this study thick 2 μm; bulk GaInAsSb layers lattice-matched to GaSb substrates were grown across the entire (lattice-matched) compositional range at low growth temperatures (450 °C), including the immiscibility region, when grown under non-equilibrium conditions with MBE. High quality epitaxial layers were grown for all compositions, as evidenced by smooth morphology (atomic force microscopy), high structural quality (X-ray diffraction), low alloy fluctuactions (electron dispersive spectroscopy in cross sectioned samples), and bright room temperature photoluminescence. Because initial theoretical efforts have suggessted that lattice strain can influence layer stability, we have studied effects of strain on alloy stability. Unstable and metastable alloys were grown hot enough for the onset of phase separation, then progressively strained and characterized. We show that strain is effective in suppressing phase separation. Finally, we performed time-resolved carrier lifetime measurements for InAsSb alloy with low concentrations of Ga to investigate the role of Ga in influencing nonradiative carrier recombination. There have been studies on non-Ga containing antimonide structures (InAsSb, InAs/InAsSb) that show long carrier lifetimes, which suggest that Ga plays a role in reducing carrier lifetime, because Ga-containing structures such as InAs/GaSb superlattices have much shorter carrier lifetimes. Ga may reduce carrier lifetime through native defects that increase background carrier concentration, or that create mid-gap electronic states. Here, a series of GaInAsSb alloys were grown with low to zero Ga concentration. No difference in carrier lifetime was observed between Ga and Ga-free structures, and minority carrier lifetimes 3 ̆e 600 ns were observed.

D A dissertation submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Commonwealth University. Virginia Commonwealth University, 2017 Major Director: Dr. Hadis Morkoç, Professor, Electrical and Computer Engineering This thesis focuses on growth of Zn polar BeMgZnO/ZnO heterostructure on GaN/sapphire template with two dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) {{for the application of}} UV photodetector/emitter and high speed electronics. The motivation of using BeMgZnO as a barrier layer originates from the need to reach plasmon-LO phonon resonance in order to obtain minimum longitudinal optical (LO) phonon lifetime. Presence of 2 DEG was realized in BeMgZnO/ZnO heterostructure only when the Zn polarity was achieved during the nucleation growth of ZnO on GaN/sapphire template. It was found that, polarity of ZnO on (0001) GaN/sapphire template can be controlled by the oxygen to Zn ratio used during the nucleation growth. To obtain high structural and optical quality of BeMgZnO quaternary <b>alloy,</b> <b>growth</b> kinetics of BeMgZnO layer has been studied at the temperature range from 450 °C- 500 °C. We have achieved the growth of single crystal Be. 03 Mg 00. 15 ZnO alloy at 500 °C, more than 100 °C higher compared to what reported in literature, on the (0001) GaN/sapphire template through the control of Zn/(Be+Mg) flux ratio. We have also observed a thermodynamic limitation of Mg incorporation into the wurtzite BeMgZnO alloy where the excess Mg adatom accumulated in the growing surface as a MgO rich cluster. Two dimensional electron gas with high (1. 2 × 1013 cm- 2) sheet carrier density was achieved at the Be 0. 03 Mg 0. 41 ZnO/ZnO interface through strain engineering by incorporating Be into MgZnO ternary alloy. To obtain the similar sheet carrier density it would require above 60 % of Mg in MgZnO/ZnO heterostructure with reduced structural quality.

40|$|The III-nitride {{semiconductor}} {{materials have}} wide direct bandgap ranging from 6. 2 eV (AlN); through 3. 4 eV (GaN) to 0. 65 eV (InN). Alloys have been {{realized in the}} entire composition range. Thus, within one material system the possibility exists to create devices, emitting light from the infrared to the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. Compared to other semiconductors, the materials also possess several other attractive characteristics for devices, such as good thermal conductivity, high breakdown field and resistance to both high temperatures and chemically hostile environments. Despite the rapid commercial progress of the III-nitride technology, {{there is room for}} much material improvement. The most important drawbacks are related to the substrate. For epitaxial growth, there is no commonly available GaN substrate, which is matching in lattice constant and thermal expansion coefficient. Therefore, epitaxial material exhibits high threading dislocation density, typically 10 ^(8) - 10 ^(10) cm^(- 2). Due to the different nature of the three binaries, growth of alloys and their impurity incorporation are not fully understood. Further, the chemical stability and wide bandgap introduces difficulties in device processing. This work concerns issues for the III-nitrides that arise in material growth and device fabrication. Initial growth on a sapphire substrate, growth parameter settings, material characterization, and, finally, device processing were studied. The material growth was, with a few exceptions, made by molecular beam epitaxy. The MBE technique has several strengths such as high purity, abrupt heterostructure interfaces, precise thickness control and the possibility for monitoring of the surface. In particular, the initial atomic layer-by-layer growth of GaN and AlN on sapphire substrates were investigated. It was demonstrated that the Al/N flux ratio during nucleation layer growth had great influence on material properties of the layer on top. For very N-rich nucleation layer growth (Al/N < 0. 4), the material quality was poor. In contrast, material with high crystalline quality and low surface roughness was obtained using an intermediate growth mode (0. 4 < Al/N < 0. 7) for the nucleation layer. The standard Al/N = 1 nucleation layer was shown to create micropipes in GaN and AlN overlayers. It was demonstrated that annealed substrates are more forgiving for improper nucleation layer growth parameters. Material grown on annealed sapphire exhibited much improved structural quality compared to using non-annealed substrates. Further, we have shown that impurity incorporation in GaN depends on growth parameters. The influence of the dislocation density on photoluminescence intensity of GaN was measured and a model was developed, which accounted for the reduction in intensity. In order to understand InGaN <b>alloy</b> <b>growth,</b> the adsorption of Ga and In on the GaN(0001) surface was studied. Both Ga and In bilayer formation was demonstrated. The bilayer thickness could be estimated to 2. 2 ML using reflection high-energy electron diffraction. Multilayer structures were investigated by X-ray diffraction and infrared absorption spectroscopy. A 20 period AlN/GaN multiple quantum well was required to observe intersubband transitions. Finally, device processing of III-nitride materials has been investigated. The knowledge gained from these investigations was used to process small mesa structures and a blue InGaN light-emitting diode...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} program reported here {{is focused on}} critical issues that represent conspicuous gaps in current understanding of rapid solidification, limiting our ability to predict and control microstructural evolution (i. e. morphological dynamics and microsegregation) at high undercooling, where conditions depart significantly from local equilibrium. More specifically, through careful application of phase-field modeling, using appropriate thin-interface and anti-trapping corrections and addressing important details such as transient effects and a velocity-dependent (i. e. adaptive) numerics, the current analysis provides a reasonable simulation-based picture of non-equilibrium solute partitioning and the corresponding oscillatory dynamics associated with single-phase rapid solidification and show that this method is a suitable means for a self-consistent simulation of transient behavior and operating point selection under rapid growth conditions. Moving beyond the limitations of conventional theoretical/analytical treatments of non-equilibrium solute partitioning, these results serve to substantiate recent experimental findings and analytical treatments for single-phase rapid solidification. The departure from the equilibrium solid concentration at the solid-liquid interface was often observed during rapid solidification, and the energetic associated non-equilibrium solute partitioning has been treated in detail, providing possible ranges of interface concentrations for a given growth condition. Use of these treatments for analytical description of specific single-phase dendritic and cellular operating point selection, however, requires a model for solute partitioning under a given set of growth conditions. Therefore, analytical solute trapping models which describe the chemical partitioning {{as a function of}} steady state interface velocities have been developed and widely utilized in most of the theoretical investigations of rapid solidification. However, these solute trapping models are not rigorously verified due to the difficulty in experimentally measuring under rapid growth conditions. Moreover, since these solute trapping models include kinetic parameters which are difficult to directly measure from experiments, application of the solute trapping models or the associated analytic rapid solidification model is limited. These theoretical models for steady state rapid solidification which incorporate the solute trapping models do not describe the interdependency of solute diffusion, interface kinetics, and alloy thermodynamics. The phase-field approach allows calculating, spontaneously, the non-equilibrium growth effects of alloys and the associated time-dependent growth dynamics, without making the assumptions that solute partitioning is an explicit function of velocity, as is the current convention. In the research described here, by utilizing the phase-field model in the thin-interface limit, incorporating the anti-trapping current term, more quantitatively valid interface kinetics and solute diffusion across the interface are calculated. In order to sufficiently resolve the physical length scales (i. e. interface thickness and diffusion boundary length), grid spacings are continually adjusted in calculations. The full trajectories of transient planar growth dynamics under rapid directional solidification conditions with different pulling velocities are described. As a validation of a model, the predicted steady state conditions are consistent with the analytic approach for rapid growth. It was confirmed that rapid interface dynamics exhibits the abrupt acceleration of the planar front when the effect of the non-equilibrium solute partitioning at the interface becomes signi ficant. This is consistent with the previous linear stability analysis for the non-equilibrium interface dynamics. With an appropriate growth condition, the continuous oscillation dynamics was able to be simulated using continually adjusting grid spacings. This oscillatory dynamics including instantaneous jump of interface velocities are consistent with a previous phenomenological model by and a numerical investigation, which may cause the formation of banded structures. Additionally, the selection of the steady state growth dynamics in the highly undercooled melt is demonstrated. The transition of the growth morphology, interface velocity selection, and solute trapping phenomenon with increasing melt supersaturations was described by the phase-field simulation. The tip selection for the dendritic growth was consistent with Ivantsov's function, and the non-equilibrium chemical partitioning behavior shows good qualitative agreement with the Aziz's solute trapping model even though the model parameter(V{sub D}) remains as an arbitrary constant. This work is able to show the possibility of comprehensive description of rapid <b>alloy</b> <b>growth</b> over the entire time-dependent non-equilibrium phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{thin film}} semiconducting and magnetic devices {{depends upon the}} chemical and physical status of the as-grown structure. Since the dimensions of many devices {{can be in the}} Angstrom and nanometre region, characterisation techniques capable of measuring chemical and physical parameters in this regime are necessary if an understanding of the effect of specimen structure on observed properties is to be achieved. This thesis uses high resolution x-ray scattering techniques to characterise sub-micron layered structures of semiconducting and magnetic materials. Double crystal diffraction is routinely employed in the semiconductor industry for the on line inspection of sample quality. While material parameters such as sample perfection and layer composition may be rapidly deduced, the non-destructive measurement of layer thickness is more difficult (particularly for multilayered samples) and lengthy simulation procedures are often necessary to extract the thickness information from a double crystal diffraction profile. However, for semiconductor structures which act as Bragg case interferometers, oscillations (known as thickness fringes) appear in the diffracted profile. The period of these fringes can be directly related to layer thickness. Attempts to Fourier transform diffraction data, in order to automatically extract the frequency" of thickness fringes, have previously been only partially successful. It is shown that the relatively weak intensity of the thickness fringes and the presence of the substrate peak in the analysed diffraction data, drastically reduce the quality of the subsequent Fourier transform. A procedure for the manipulation of diffraction data is suggested, where an "average” envelope is fitted to the thickness fringes and used to normalise the data. The application of an auto-correlation is shown to further increase the quality of the Fourier transform of the normalised data. The application of Fourier transform techniques to the routine analysis of double crystal diffraction data is discussedA novel technique for the measurement of absolute lattice parameters of single crystals is presented, which is capable of determining lattice constants with an absolute accuracy of around 2 parts in 10 (^ 5). The technique requires only the use of a conventional triple crystal diffractometer with motorised 20 circle movement and the provision for a fine, precise rocking motion of the analyser. To demonstrate the technique, exemplary measurements on GaAs and InAs crystals are presented. Triple crystal diffi-action analysis has been performed on three material systems of current technological interest; the Hg(_ 1 -x) Mn(_x) Te on GaAs, the Cd(_ 1 -x) Hg(_x) Te on CdTe/Cd(_ 1 -x) Zn(_x) Te and the low temperature grown GaAs systems. Studies on the Hg(_ 1 -x) Mn(_x) Te on GaAs system reveal that the principal contribution to the rocking curve widths of layers grown using the direct <b>alloy</b> <b>growth</b> (DAG) method, arise from the tilt (i. e., mosaicity) of layer sub-grains. This finding is confirmed by double crystal topography which shows that the layers are highly mosaic with a typical grain size of (130 ± 5) µm. Topographic studies of Hg(_ 1 -x) Mn(_x) Te on GaAs, grown using the interdiffused multilayer process (IMP), show that sample quality is significantly improved with single crystal material being produced using this growth method. Triple crystal diffraction studies of the Cd(_ 1 -x) Hg(_x) Te on CdTe/Cd(_ 0. 96) Zn(_ 0. 04) Te systems reveal several findings. These are that the main contribution to rocking curve widths is from lattice tilts and that the tilt distribution increases as the layer thickness decreases. Further, the quality of the Cd(_ 0. 96) Zn(_ 0. 04) Te substrate analysed is superior to that of the CdTe and that Cd(_ 1 -x) Hg(_x) Te layers grown on Cd(_ 0. 96) Zn(_ 0. 04) Te substrates are generally of a higher quality than those grown on CdTe. Triple crystal analysis of MBE and ALE grown GaAs films, deposited at low growth temperatures, show that, at equivalent temperatures, superior quality films are grown by the ALE technique. Narrow lattice dilation and tilt distributions are reported for GaAs films grown at temperatures as low as 300 ºC by the ALE method. While diffraction techniques are highly suitable for the study of relatively perfect crystalline material, they are not appropriate to the analysis of heavily dislocated or even amorphous specimens. This is not the case for the Grazing Incidence X-Ray Reflectivity (GIXR) technique, whose sensitivity is not dependent upon sample structure. The GIXR technique is currently attracting increasing interest following the development of commercial instruments. In this thesis, GIXR has been used to probe the layer thickness and interfacial roughness of a series of magnetic multilayer samples and Si/Si(_x) Ge(_ 1 -x) superlattices. The technique is shown to be capable of measuring layer thickness to an accuracy of one monolayer. Modelling of specular GIXR data for the Si/Si(_x) Ge(_ 1 -x) superlattices has shown that the magnitude of interfacial roughness is different for the two types of interface within the high Ge content superlattice samples, the Si(_x) Ge(_ 1 -x) →Si interface possessing a long range sinusoidal roughness of (0. 9 ± 0. 3) nm, in addition to die short range roughness of (0. 5 ± 0. 2) nm present at all interfaces. By collecting the diffuse scatter from a GIXR experiment, conformal, or correlated, roughness has been observed in both the multilayer and superlattice samples...|$|E
