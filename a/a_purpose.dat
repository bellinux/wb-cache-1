40|$|We {{report the}} results of two {{experiments}} that test a cognitive explanation for escalation of commitment to a failing project. We examine whether an information-processing objective (i. e., purpose) influences the mental representations individuals construct to acquire and store information, which in turn, {{determine whether or not}} individuals recommend discontinuing a failing project. In Experiment 1, we find that participants assigned to make a project-continuation recommendation (relevant purpose) are more likely to remember critical threats to project viability than are participants assigned <b>a</b> specific, alternative <b>purpose.</b> Moreover, participants assigned <b>a</b> relevant <b>purpose</b> are more likely to recommend discontinuing the failing project than are participants assigned <b>a</b> specific, alternative <b>purpose</b> or <b>a</b> general <b>purpose.</b> <b>A</b> mediation analysis supports the theoretical model and suggests that cognitive factors are at least partially responsible for escalation of commitment. In Experiment 2, we test whether additional cognitive effort induced via a justification requirement reduces escalation of commitment.
