50|$|CD34 and Myf5 markers {{specifically}} {{define the}} majority of quiescent satellite cells. Activated satellite cells prove problematic to identify, especially as their markers change with the degree of activation; for example, greater activation results in the progressive loss of Pax7 expression {{as they enter the}} proliferative stage. However, Pax7 is expressed prominently after satellite cell differentiation. Greater activation also results in increased expression of myogenic basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors MyoD, myogenin, and MRF4 - all responsible for the induction of myocyte-specific genes.

5000|$|In Noct, the protagonist, {{an unnamed}} survivor, {{can be seen}} through a thermal imaging satellite, and can only be {{controlled}} from that perspective. As the player moves the character through the wasteland, they will receive messages from the overwatch, {{who are responsible for}} the <b>active</b> <b>satellite,</b> which give the player certain quests to perform to track down the Nocturnal's origin. In a total of four acts, the player is set to complete these quests as primary objective, while they also have to find food, water and weaponry, which were hidden inside buildings during the invasion. All weapons in the game only feature a minimal magazine, while the player is also not able to carry more than three external magazines to reload the weapon. If the player ever runs out ammo, they have to rely on melee combat until they find another weapon or ammo crate. At random times, the player encounters one of the Nocturnal monster, foreshadowing it with the protagonist releasing a slight [...] "uh oh!" [...] upon them coming nearer. In case the player is inside a building, they are unable to see anything outside the room they are standing in. The only thing visible for the player are the doors of that building, which open and close if a Nocturnal enters one, so that the player can evaluate if it is safe to leave the room they are in. Once the player dies, you can see the overwatch switch to a new survivor, leading him to the previous survivor's corpse to retrieve the items already gather and continue their quest. In online multiplayer, the player eventually meets up with others, and they have to decide quick if they are working together or try to murder each other to gain each other's weapons and ammo.|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the relationship between different levels of dietary lysine and satellite cell mitotic activity during the early post-hatch period. Broiler chicks were split into five groups of 10 birds each immediately post-hatch. One group was not provided any feed or water for the first three days post-hatch, whereas the other groups were provided a standard starter diet with different levels of lysine (0. 82, 0. 99, 1. 16, 1. 33 %) for the first three days post-hatch. All birds were injected with 5 -Bromo- 2 `-deoxyuridine (BrdU) 2 hours before they were killed on the third day post-hatch. Mitotically <b>active</b> <b>satellite</b> cells were identified in the Pectoralis thoracicus and quantified using BrdU immunohistochemistry in combination with computer-based image analysis. Satellite cell mitotic activity was significantly (P < 0. 05) lower in the starved compared to any of the fed groups. However, satellite cell mitotic activity was highest (P < 0. 05) in the birds that were provided a lysine deficient diet (0. 82 %). The current study suggests that it is possible to nutritionally stimulate the satellite cell population in the early post-hatch chick, and that it is an important endeavour to re-examine the nutritional requirements of the early post-hatch chick to optimize meat yield...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Satellite {{cells are}} mitotically active cells in {{skeletal}} muscle that contribute new nuclei to growing myofibers. The {{objective of this}} experiment was to determine satellite cell mitotic activity in turkey embryos, early post-hatch poults, and 1 week-old poults. All poults were fed a standard corn and soybean meal based starter diet throughout the experiment. 5 -bromo- 2 ’deoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected intra-abdominally into all poults and embryos. Pectoralis thoracicus were harvested two hours post-injection to determine mitotically <b>active</b> <b>satellite</b> cells. Samples were taken at 25 days of incubation (25 E), day-of-hatch, 1 day-of-age, and 1 wk-of-age (n = 10 for all groups). BrdU immunohistochemistry along with computer-based image {{analysis was used to}} identify the mitotically <b>active</b> <b>satellite</b> cells. Satellite cell mitotic activity was lower (P < 0. 05) at 25 E compared to day of hatch. Furthermore, there was an age-related decrease (P < 0. 05) in satellite cell mitotic activity between 1 day posthatch to one week-of-age. The low satellite cell mitotic activity at 25 E suggests that late embryonic development may be a developmental period to target increasing satellite cell mitotic activity. Furthermore, the normally high satellite cell mitotic activity immediately post-hatch suggests that the early post-hatch period is also an important target for nutritional manipulations aimed at improving skeletal muscle growth and meat yield...|$|E
