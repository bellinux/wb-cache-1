40|$|Abstract- Cryptography is {{the study}} of {{mathematical}} techniques related to aspects of information security such as confidentiality, data integrity, entity authentication, and data origin authentication. Steganography is the science of embedding information into the cover image viz., text, video, and image without causing statistically significant modification to the cover image. Combining these two techniques either way together result to new technique-Metamorphic Cryptography [14]. The data (text, <b>audio,</b> <b>video,</b> images) is transformed into cipher data using a key, concealed into another cover object (<b>audio,</b> <b>video,</b> images) using Steganography converting it into a Stegno object, and is finally sent to the receiver. Or the data (text, <b>audio,</b> <b>video,</b> images) is concealed into Cover Object resulting into Stegno Object, (Steganography) and further converting Stegno Object into Cipher Stegno Object (<b>audio,</b> <b>video,</b> images) using Cryptography, and is finally sent to the receiver. This proposed both the technique thus achieves double layer security to data...|$|R

This study was ex post facto research. The {{population}} was students in grade XII <b>Audio</b> <b>Video</b> Competence Skills as many as 62 students which all students were taken for research subject. Content validity test and instrument construction was done by asking the judgment experts in entrepreneurship field. There were two lecturers of Education Electronics FT UNY and two teachers of SMK Muhammadiyah 1 Bantul. Test instrument was conducted on 30 students of class XII <b>Audio</b> <b>Video</b> Competence Skills. Validity test was product moment correlation by Pearson, whereas reliability test was Alpha Cronbach. The data were analyzed with quantitative method using product moment correlation, simple linear regression and multiple regressions. The results of the research are as follow: (1) Parents’ role has positive and significant impact to the entrepreneurial readiness from coefficients r count of 0, 289 and sig. 0, 023.
