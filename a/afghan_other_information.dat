Using standardized regressions, we find volatility increases when current 2 ̆ 2 <b>other</b> <b>information</b> 2 ̆ 2 is more uncertain and increases more in response to unfavorable news compared to favorable news. Variance decomposition analysis shows that the variance contribution of 2 ̆ 2 <b>other</b> <b>information</b> 2 ̆ 2 dominates that of expected-return news. The incremental role of 2 ̆ 2 <b>other</b> <b>information</b> 2 ̆ 2 is {{at least half of}} the effect of earnings in explaining future volatility. The results are more pronounced for firms with poor information environments. Overall, our results highlight the importance of including 2 ̆ 2 <b>other</b> <b>information</b> 2 ̆ 2 as an additional cash-flow proxy in future studies of stock prices and volatility...|$|R
