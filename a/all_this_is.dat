5|$|Critics {{have complained}} that, by museum {{display of the}} remains, the body of Lindow Man has been {{objectified}} rather than treated with the respect due the dead. Emma Restall Orr, a neo-druid, has questioned whether the body should be displayed at <b>all.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> part of a wider discussion about the scientific treatment of human remains and museum researchers and archaeologists using them as information sources.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, Constantinople was {{undergoing}} expansion. The cosmopolitan {{character of the}} city was being reinforced by the arrival of Italian merchants and Crusaders en route to the Holy Land. The Venetians, the Genoese, and others opened up the ports of the Aegean to commerce, shipping goods from the Crusader kingdoms of Outremer and Fatimid Egypt to the west and trading with Byzantium via Constantinople. These maritime traders stimulated demand in the towns and cities of Greece, Macedonia, and the Greek Islands, generating new sources of wealth in a predominantly agrarian economy. Thessaloniki, the second city of the Empire, hosted a famous summer fair that attracted traders from across the Balkans and even further afield to its bustling market stalls. In Corinth, silk production fuelled a thriving economy. <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a testament {{to the success of the}} Komnenian Emperors in securing a Pax Byzantina in these heartland territories.|$|E

25|$|<b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> further {{evidence}} that Braham's singing showed similar traces of ‘otherness’ to that of Leoni, whose use of falsetto was also characteristic, and that this relic of Braham’s early training was amongst the factors enabling him to present a singing style clearly demarcated, for the cognoscenti, from both the prevalent Italian and home-grown English styles.|$|E

25|$|An {{exception}} to <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{the northern end}} of the present wood, known as The Bedlams. This is not ancient wood, but a 19th-century conifer plantation, which was replanted in the 1950s with beech, Norway spruce, Western hemlock and Grand fir. Also, a re-instated open-cast ironstone quarry on the eastern side was planted with Corsican pine.|$|E
25|$|The {{system of}} {{underground}} piles and beams {{that has been}} constructed not only supports the cemetery walls and the Cross of Sacrifice terrace, but also supports the graves and headstones as well.

25|$|Mainly, {{this is an}} {{attribute}} of metals, meaning that, in general, the greater the metallic character of an element the greater the electropositivity. Therefore, the alkali metals are most electropositive of <b>all.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> {{because they have a}} single electron in their outer shell and, as this is relatively far from the nucleus of the atom, it is easily lost; in other words, these metals have low ionization energies.|$|E

25|$|Taylor's set lists largely include {{songs from}} the Great American Songbook and his own compositions. His {{arrangements}} and compositions are often influenced by composers like Nelson Riddle and Duke Ellington and, as such, include many moving lines {{to fill in the}} spaces, e.g., walking basslines, syncopated chordal 'stabs' (to emulate horn sections), and complex jazz harmony. <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> achieved without compromising the melody, which he considers the most important element in any arrangement.|$|E
25|$|The {{translation}} of cuneiform documents is quite difficult, {{especially given the}} damaged nature of much source material. Additionally, {{our knowledge of the}} underlying languages, like Akkadian and Sumerian, have evolved over time, so a translation done now may be quite different than one done in AD 1900. The result of <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> that there can be honest disagreement what the document really says. Worse yet, many archaeological finds have not yet been published, much less translated. Those held in private collections may never be.|$|E
25|$|The {{implication}} of <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> that the Mercian submission to Alfred – a crucial {{step in the}} creation of a single English kingdom – occurred not just because of one battle, Alfred's victory over the Great Army at Edington in 878, but also because of another, more distant battle, 'God's revenge' on the Mercians at the Conwy, when Anarawd of Gwynedd and his brothers defeated Æthelred and so brought about that collapse of the Mercian hegemony in Wales from which Alfred was only too pleased to benefit.|$|E

25|$|The {{function}} of the vestibular system during spaceflight {{is by far the}} most carefully studied of <b>all.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> especially true of the gravity-sensing otolith organs and their relationship to eye movements. The vestibular semicircular canal function seems unchanged in weightlessness because the horizontal eye movements that compensated for head yaw rotation are not affected by spaceflight. The absence of gravity stimulation of the otoliths reduces the torsional vestibulo-ocular reflex during head roll rotation in microgravity. This deficit is absent when astronauts are exposed to centrifugal forces, suggesting that the adaptive CNS changes are taking place centrally rather than peripherally.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the small}} size of Israel, the {{concentration}} of hi-tech firms across much of the country is enough for it to be recognised as one large cluster. Most activity is located in the densely populated areas of metropolitan Tel Aviv, Haifa (Matam), and Jerusalem (Technology Park, Malha, Har Hotzvim and JVP Media Quarter in Talpiot), and the Startup Village Ecosystem in the Yokneam area, although some secondary with additional activity include the corridor to Beer Sheba, including Kiryat Gat, and the Western Galilee. In <b>all,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> an area no larger than 6000 square kilometers, half of the extended Silicon Valley's geographical coverage.|$|E
25|$|The {{outcome of}} <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> that the {{kinetics}} of the NaV channels {{are governed by}} a transition matrix whose rates are voltage-dependent in a complicated way. Since these channels themselves {{play a major role}} in determining the voltage, the global dynamics of the system can be quite difficult to work out. Hodgkin and Huxley approached the problem by developing a set of differential equations for the parameters that govern the ion channel states, known as the Hodgkin-Huxley equations. These equations have been extensively modified by later research, but form the starting point for most theoretical studies of action potential biophysics.|$|E

25|$|The RFCC is the {{culmination}} of all the recruits training. The course begins with the BPT (Battle Physical Training) Pass Out which consists of a 30 Foot Rope Climb, 200m Fireman's Carry, Assault Course and Full Regain. <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> undertaken carrying Full Fighting Order and Weapon. Successful recruits then progress onto the 12 Mile Loaded Carry and Four Day Field Exercise. Once passed, recruits are awarded the cap comforter and may continue onto the final element of the course, the commando tests. These commando tests consist of the Tarzan Assault Course, Endurance Course, 9 Mile Speed March and 30 Miler. On successful completion of the RFCC, {{at the end of the}} 30 Miler, the RMR recruits are awarded the coveted green beret.|$|E
25|$|This {{notation}} {{means that}} the corresponding Slater determinants have a clear higher weight in the configuration interaction expansion. The atomic orbital concept is therefore a key concept for visualizing the excitation process associated with a given transition. For example, one can say for a given transition that it corresponds to the excitation of an electron from an occupied orbital to a given unoccupied orbital. Nevertheless, one has {{to keep in mind}} that electrons are fermions ruled by the Pauli exclusion principle and cannot be distinguished from the other electrons in the atom. Moreover, it sometimes happens that the configuration interaction expansion converges very slowly and that one cannot speak about simple one-determinant wave function at <b>all.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> the case when electron correlation is large.|$|E
