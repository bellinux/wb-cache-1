The {{analysis}} is conducted on the EU prices of tomatoes, lemons and apples for some of the main competing countries on the EU domestic markets: Morocco, Argentina, Turkey and China. The econometric analysis is based on testing and estimating a switching vector autoregressive model with endogenous threshold <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> level. The model shows the isolation effects and the accumulation of SIVs above the trigger <b>entry</b> <b>price.</b> This paper contributes to clarify the role played by the EPS in avoid or deter low priced imports from main EU partner Countries.

40|$|The EU protects {{some of its}} {{fruits and}} {{vegetables}} through the <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> system. This system consists on a two-tiered tariff, with high-priced exports paying an ad valorem tariff, whereas low-priced exports pay also a supplementary specific tariff. The breaking point {{between high and low}} export <b>prices</b> is the <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> level decided by the EU, generally the same level for all third countries. In a few cases, some Southern Mediterranean partners of the EU have agreed a reduced <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> for their exports, together with the more common ad valorem tariff reduction. Among the indicators used for gauge the value of preferences, there is no one devoted to this case of reduced <b>entry</b> <b>price,</b> hence we develop a new indicator that allows to split which part of the preferential gains corresponds to the <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> reduction and which part corresponds to the "usual" ad valorem tariff reduction. We apply this methodology to Moroccan clementines trade flows, with two main findings: 1) The <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> reduction ranges up to 39 % of the economic value of preferences in some months; 2) Morocco is not maximizing the gains due to this reduction, and could take some trade and policy lessons, mainly trying to better fit to the concession or, if impossible, use it as negotiating capital in future reviews of the agreement.

40|$|The <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> {{regime in}} the European Union (EU) applies to several products, mainly fresh fruits and vegetables. The {{complexity}} of the system with endogenous applied tariffs makes the evaluation of different alternatives of tariff cuts more challenging than for other regimes. The challenge applies to academics with interest on estimating market impacts, to WTO negotiators that need to evaluate proposals and to policy-makers that may need to take decisions on options such as the declaration of a sensitive product. This paper develops a methodology to compare different tariff cuts alternatives, including the URAA method that implies reductions {{in the level of}} the <b>entry</b> <b>price,</b> constant <b>entry</b> <b>price,</b> and Tariff Rate Quotas expansion. Uncertainty about international prices plays a central role on the estimated impacts on market access of different options. Reducing the level of <b>entry</b> <b>prices</b> can have relatively large impacts on market access for some products. The sensitive product treatment with TRQs may generate larger market access than the normal treatment. The proposed methodology proofs to be able to quantify the economic impacts of tariff cuts under EU <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> regime. International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

40|$|EU {{imports of}} oranges are {{restricted}} {{not only by}} ad valorem tariffs {{but also by the}} <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> system establishing a minimum import price. In addition, the EU applies a comprehensive system of trade preferences. The hypothesis of this paper is that, in contrast to its complexity, the effectiveness of the EU import system for oranges is low with respect to its goals, i. e. protecting EU producers and creating imports from preference receiving countries. The comparison of import prices for oranges from extra-EU countries with the EU <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> shows that the former are about 40 % higher than the latter on average. Also, it is pointed out that at least 72 % of extra-EU orange imports during the EU harvest season enter the EU tariff free. As a conclusion, the contribution of the import regime to the protection of EU producers is low. Concordantly, the preferential <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> is not utilized by orange preference receiving countries. Besides, although orange quotas increased from 1991 to 2003, actual exports from Mediterranean countries and thus quota filling rates have decreased over the same period. It is shown that EU trade preferences for oranges were not decisive for the development of Mediterranean countries' orange exports to the EU. In the light of the low effectiveness of the <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> system for oranges along with high transaction costs involved, its abolishment should be considered. Yet, results cannot be generalized, even not for citrus fruit, as is demonstrated for mandarins. trade preferences, oranges, tariff rate quota, <b>entry</b> <b>price,</b> International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{assesses the}} {{stabilization}} {{effects of the}} EU import regime for {{fresh fruit and vegetables}} based on the <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> system. The analysis is carried out on the EU prices of tomatoes and those of imports from Morocco, the main competing country on the EU domestic markets. It is based on the estimation of a threshold vector autoregressive econometric model that is shown capable of taking the workings of the import regime into account. The model shows that when prices of tomato imports are below the trigger <b>entry</b> <b>prices</b> the EU tomato market becomes isolated. However, the contribution of the import regime on price stabilization is rather limited. Since tomato imports from Morocco are granted zero tariff if their price is higher than the trigger <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> within a yearly quota that is completely filled, the largest contribution to market stabilization may well come from the size of the quota. ...|$|R

This study investigates the relevance of the EPS per product and country of origin. We develop two indicators for the effectiveness of the EPS, which serve as variables in a cluster analysis identifying four classes differing in the relevance of the EPS. The relevance of the EPS is found to be heterogeneous among products as well as countries of origin. It is highest for artichokes, courgettes, cucumbers, lemons, plums and tomatoes. The influence of the EPS on apples, clementines and pears is significantly lower, and of least relevance for apricots, mandarins, oranges, peaches and nectarines and table grapes. The EPS has the greatest effect on countries which neighbour the EU, whereas it is of minor importance for exports from far-away countries with the exception of China and South Africa. <b>Entry</b> <b>price</b> system Fruits and vegetables Import policy EU Non-tariff barriers Minimum import price...|$|R

40|$|Moroccan tomato {{production}} has expanded since {{the restructuring of}} the industry following the dismantlement of the state monopoly on food exports in the late 1980 ’s. Plastic tunnels dominate export market production. Field grown tomatoes are still exported to the EU but levels have dropped off dramatically as the EU narrowed the entry window, and as the market demanded fruit size and fruit quality {{that can only be}} produced in greenhouses or plastic tunnels. Plastic house production grew from about 323, 000 Mt {{at the beginning of the}} 1990 ’s to about 565, 000 Mt in the 2001 / 2002 season. Exports have grown from about 152, 114 Mt (47 % of production) in 1991 / 1992 to about 205, 000 Mt (36 % of production) in 2001 / 2002. The 75 % increase in production resulted in an export expansion of 35 %. Morocco imposed minimum grade (diameter) restrictions on export tomatoes, allowing only the largest sizes to be exported from the mid- 1990 s. This move was a response to the EU imposition of a minimum <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> for a negotiated tonnage of Moroccan tomatoes that are entered during the fall and winter at reduced tariffs.

40|$|The {{rising prices}} of {{pharmaceuticals}} have generated considerable, and often acrimonious, debate. Yet, {{there is little}} theoretical work or empirical evidence on pharmaceutical entry-pricing strategies or on the time paths of the prices of new entrants versus incumbents. This study explores the <b>entry</b> <b>pricing</b> strategies of pharmaceutical manufacturers. Previous theoretical models have considered a “price skimming ” strategy, with drugs entering the market at a premier relative to incumbents or a “market penetration ” strategy, pricing the drug at a discount {{in the hope of}} gaining market share. The selection of appropriate strategy depends upon the degree of product differentiation and/or the nature of repeat purchase arrangements. However, these investigations have not examined the implications of product quality for <b>entry</b> <b>pricing</b> and pricing dynamics. The present study provides a model that demonstrates the interplay between quality and product differentiation in determining the optimal pricing strategy. In particular, higher (lower) quality products will engage in price skimming (market penetration) strategies in markets where products are sufficiently differentiated, but will choose a market penetration (price skimming) strategy in markets that are less differentiated. The reason is that in less differentiated markets, price competition is mor...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} formalizes and quantifies the {{importance}} of uncertainty for investment in a corn-stover based cellulosic biofuel plant. Using a real options model we recover prices of gasoline that would trigger entry into the market and calculate the portion of that <b>entry</b> trigger <b>price</b> required to cover cost and the portion that corresponds to risk premium. We then discuss the effect of managerial flexibility on the entry risk premium and the prices of gasoline that would trigger mothballing, reactivation, and exit. Results show that the risk premium required by plants to enter the second-generation biofuel market {{is likely to be}} substantial. The analysis also reveals that a break-even approach (which ignores the portion of <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> composed of risk premium), and the traditional Marshallian approach (which ignores the portion of <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> composed of both the risk premium and the drift rate), would significantly underestimate the gasoline <b>entry</b> trigger <b>price</b> and the magnitude of that underestimation increases as both volatility and mean of gasoline prices increase. Results also uncover a great deal of hysteresis (i. e. a range of gasoline prices for which there is neither entry nor exit in the market) in entry/exit behavior by plants. Hysteresis increases as gasoline prices become more volatile. Hysteresis suggests that, at the industry level, positive (negative) demand shocks will {{have a significant impact on}} prices (production) and a limited impact on production (prices). In combination all of these results suggest that policies supporting second generation biofuels may have fallen short of their targets because of their failure to alleviate uncertainty. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{complexity}} {{derived from}} the bilateral trade liberalisation process in the Mediterranean region is difficult to represent in a trade model, {{not only because of}} the range of instruments still constraining trade but also because of the special nature of the most important traded goods (product differentiation and seasonality). Tariff-rate quotas (TRQ's) and the <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> system are clearly defined on a monthly basis for the fruits and vegetables trade flows towards the European Union (EU). This point makes efforts to model such a trade in yearly basis not representative of reality. We propose a static partial equilibrium model tailored to model trade impacts of specific policy instruments which considers imports from different sources as imperfect substitutes, following the non-linear Armington type model. Different policy scenarios have been run using the model, considering changes in TRQ's and <b>Entry</b> <b>Price</b> regimes, its tariffication and preference erosion. The results of model runs show that, as regards to EU producers, bilateral trade liberalisation with extension of TRQs would be the least dramatic scenario. By contrast, the phasing out of the <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> system would have serious consequences on EU producers. The model has also given detailed information on Morocco's interests in the negotiation, although it could easily include a larger number of suppliers. Morocco appears to be interested in multilateral liberalisation as well as in bilateral liberalisation. In fact, multilateral liberalisation will not cause a great deal of preference erosion against Moroccan exporters, unless tariff reductions only affect MFN suppliers.
