5|$|Her <b>aspiration</b> <b>for</b> fame {{commenced}} {{after she}} met Angel Anden and {{was asked to}} be a cover girl of the Valentine issue of the magazine (printed on Feb 15, 1953) called This Week (now, Chronical Magazine), where Anden was the editor. Imelda {{was not able to}} get an approval and acquire a sponsorship to participate in the Miss Manila contest from her cousins (Danieling, Eduardo, and Loreto), but, with the help of Adoracion, gained a sponsorship from Philippine Women's University after a meeting {{with the president of the}} university, Mrs. Francisca Benitez. The controversial Miss Manila beauty pageant dawned on Mar 1, 1953, when Imelda and the Reyes spouses were in great despair after hearing news that Norma Jimenez became the candidate of Miss Philippines and the winner of Miss Manila, and sought to meet the mayor of Manila, Aresenio Lacson, who revoked the decision and made Imelda Romualdez the winner of Miss Manila. The mayor announced that there were violations of rules by the International Fair Board, and it is the mayor's authority to nominate the candidate of the City of Manila for the beauty contest. It turned out that Imelda won 655 points whereas Norma Jimenez acquired 453 points. Both Imelda and Norma participated in Miss Philippines; however, the winner of Miss Philippines was Cristina Galang (Caedo, now) from Tarlac, who became one of the members of Imelda's band of women campaigners, Blue Ladies.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To assess <b>aspirations</b> <b>for</b> {{physical}} health over 18 months. To examine whether maintained importance of <b>aspirations</b> <b>for</b> {{physical health}} mediated and/or moderated {{the effect of}} an intensive intervention on long-term tobacco abstinence. Methods: Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} an intervention based on self-determination theory or to community care, and provided data at baseline and at 18 and 30 months post-randomization. Results: <b>Aspirations</b> <b>for</b> physical health were better maintained over 18 months among participants in the intervention (mean change =. 05), relative to community care (mean change = −. 13), t = 2. 66, p 3 ̆c. 01. Maintained importance of <b>aspirations</b> <b>for</b> physical health partially mediated the treatment condition effects on seven-day point prevalence tobacco abstinence (z′ = 1. 68, p 3 ̆c. 01) and the longest number of days not smoking (z′ = 2. 16, p 3 ̆c. 01), and interacted with treatment condition to facilitate the longest number of days not smoking (β =. 08, p 3 ̆c. 05). Conclusion: Maintained importance of <b>aspirations</b> <b>for</b> physical health facilitated tobacco abstinence...|$|R

Findings showed that while majority of mothers (74 %) held high educational <b>aspirations</b> <b>for</b> their children, a substantial proportion (12. 4 %) only aspired for their children to attain high school education and below. Consistent with hypothesis of the transactional model (Sameroff & Mackenzie, 2003) used in this study, both parental (socioeconomic status, household size and age) and child characteristics (birth order, gender and conduct problems) significantly predicted mothers’ <b>aspirations</b> <b>for</b> their children's education.

25|$|Members {{describe}} {{their sense of}} relaxation and liberation, and the increasing value of restraint and modesty in their lives.

With these old attitudes, egocentricity and exaggerated, false self-confidence perpetuate the problem which led them to join OA.

25|$|The Rainbow follows {{three generations}} of a Nottinghamshire farming family from the pre-{{industrial}} to the industrial age, focusing particularly on a daughter, Ursula, and her <b>aspiration</b> <b>for</b> a more fulfilling life than that of becoming a housebound wife.

Both novels challenged conventional ideas about the arts, politics, economic growth, gender, sexual experience, friendship and marriage and {{can be seen as}} far ahead of their time. The frank and relatively straightforward manner in which Lawrence dealt with sexual attraction was ostensibly what got the books banned, perhaps in particular the mention of same-sex attraction – Ursula has an affair with a woman in The Rainbow and in Women in Love there is an undercurrent of attraction between the two principal male characters.|$|E

25|$|India's {{position}} on {{the establishment of the}} State of Israel was affected by many factors, including India's own partition on religious lines, and India's relationship with other nations. Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi believed the Jews had a good case and a prior claim for Israel, but opposed the creation of Israel on religious or mandated terms. India voted against the Partitioning of Palestine plan of 1947 and voted against Israel's admission to the United Nations in 1949. Various proponents of Hindu nationalism supported or sympathised with the creation of Israel. Hindu Mahasabha leader Vinayak Damodar Savarkar supported the creation of Israel on both moral and political grounds, and condemned India's vote at the UN against Israel. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leader Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar admired Jewish nationalism and believed Palestine was the natural territory of the Jewish people, essential to their <b>aspiration</b> <b>for</b> nationhood.|$|E
25|$|Turbochargers {{are also}} {{employed}} in certain two-stroke cycle diesel engines, which would normally require a Roots blower for aspiration. In this specific application, mainly Electro-Motive diesel (EMD) 567, 645, and 710 Series engines, the turbocharger is initially {{driven by the}} engine's crankshaft through a gear train and an overrunning clutch, thereby providing <b>aspiration</b> <b>for</b> combustion. After combustion has been achieved, and after the exhaust gases have reached sufficient heat energy, the overrunning clutch is automatically disengaged, and the turbo-compressor is thereafter driven exclusively by the exhaust gases. In the EMD application, the turbocharger acts as a compressor for normal aspiration during starting and low power output settings and is used for true turbocharging during medium and high power output settings. This is particularly beneficial at high altitudes, as are often encountered on western U.S. railroads. It is possible for the turbocharger to revert to compressor mode momentarily during commands for large increases in engine power.|$|E
25|$|The flag of Ireland is a tricolour of green, {{white and}} orange. The flag {{originates}} with the Young Ireland {{movement of the}} mid-19th century but was not popularised until its use during the Easter Rising of 1916. The colours represent the Gaelic tradition (green) and the followers of William of Orange in Ireland (orange), with white representing the <b>aspiration</b> <b>for</b> peace between them. It was adopted as {{the flag of the}} Irish Free State in 1922 and continues to be used as the sole flag and ensign of the state. A naval jack, a green flag with a yellow harp, is set out in Defence Forces Regulations and flown from the mast head of ships in addition to the national flag in limited circumstances (e.g. when a ship is not underway). It is based on the unofficial green ensign of Ireland used in the 18th and 19th centuries and the traditional green flag of Ireland dating from the 16th century.|$|E
