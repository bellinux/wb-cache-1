In a complex volcanic area like Mt. Etna (Sicily, Italy), the existence of both iso-oriented fault systems and intrusive bodies consisting of olivine and clinopyroxene suggest the presence of anisotropic structures. In order to investigate this we analyzed the physical phenomenon of shear-wave splitting since under certain constraints, shear waves are less sensitive to local heterogeneity. The aims of this paper are: 1) to evaluate if in <b>a</b> structural complex <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> at Mt. Etna the signal crossing an anisotropic volume could be enhanced in spite of effects due to undirectional properties along the source-receiver path; 2) to investigate the correlations, if any, between polarization direction of the leading shear wave and the patterns of compressive stress acting on the investigated area. Therefore we measured time-delays between the S-onsets on the horizontal components of 3 D seismograms to reveal the possible seismic anisotropy in the Etnean region; moreover, we analyzed the polarization vector of shear-waves seismic data recorded during a survey {{carried out in the}} spring-summer 1988. We found clear evidence of splitting that we attributed to the presence of an anisotropic volume not homogeneously distributed on the eastern slope of Mt. Etna volcano...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Reputation {{systems have}} been popular in several online market places {{involving}} anonymous players {{as it can provide}} crucial information on the trustworthiness of an object or individual player to combat selfish and deceptive behaviors from peers. Individual feedbacks on the quality of past association are the fundamental building blocks of reputation systems. Careful consideration in aggregating feedbacks from different sources is in fact very important in computing a reliable value for trust worthiness to facilitate decision making in <b>a</b> social dilemma <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of online market places. In this paper we are considering a possible improvement to a reputation model <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of eBay, with our interest lying on investigating how the cooperativeness and population of cooperators would evolve if the weight of the feedback source was assigned on the basis of past association between players. We categorize the feedback source as direct source, gray source and opposition friendly source to define an aggregation method for trustworthiness assessment that considers applying a dynamically computed weight to each source of feedback. Our result shows that breaking feedback sources on the basis of acquaintance and assigning weight accordingly favors the evolution of cooperativeness in the player society as compared to models which do not classify the feedback sources. A genetic algorithm based spatial iterated prisoner’s dilemma (SIPD) environment has been used to simulate the experiments...|$|R
40|$|This chapter explores {{leadership}} {{behavior in}} a life-threatening situation-fire in a coal mine. Previous chapters have discussed the database of interviews with miners who escaped from underground fires. Researchers raised questions such as: (1) Who led the miners out of the mine? (2) Did leadership {{make a difference in}} the escapes? (3) Was the escape leader the hierarchal leader? (4) What, if any, characteristics did the escape leaders possess? Subsequently, researchers analyzed the mine fire database from a group interaction perspective to address the leadership questions posed. Leadership has been one of the most researched topics of human behavior in the twentieth century. Studies have ranged from individual characteristics of leaders, to situational leadership, to interaction of leader and follower, suggesting different leadership techniques for different followers. The question that emerges here is: Are there different types of leadership that "fit" different kinds of <b>situations?</b> In <b>a</b> crisis <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> examined in the present study, such information about leadership may significantly improve the chances of escape. To address these issues, the study team looked at the formal authority structure before each fire, considered leadership behavior or lack of leadership during the escapes, and examined those conditions associated with the emergence of leadership. According to Bardo [1978], "Emergent behaviors are those forms of action, and the norms, values and beliefs governing those actions, that rise out of the disaster situation. " This chapter discusses previous studies in the area of crisis leadership and examines the emergent behaviors of leaders under duress during the mine fire escapes. Previous Studies The research on leadership during emergency situations has consisted mainly of simulation and field studies, with the principal concern being escape from building fires. During the 1980 s, Hayashi [1988] created a computer simulation model to evaluate leader {{behavior in a}} fire. Although his purpose was to aid in planning for disaster prevention, his findings are relevant because they address the issue of situational leadership in crisis-where a leader changes his or her behavior to fit the situation. Essentially, his simulation model was designed to judge the actions and thinking of leaders. The simulation was tried by 101 subject/leaders 4 times each. The simulation consisted of amaze containing the leader, an informal leader, and 50 evacuees. Interestingly, the results indicated that the leader's actions were not dictated by circumstances. Any differences in behavior were attributed to the individual characteristics of each leader. The study also showed that the worse the situation became, the less individua...|$|R

It {{was in the}} {{beginning}} of the month of November 17--when a young English gentleman, who had just left the university of Oxford, made use of the liberty afforded him to visit some parts of the north of England; and curiosity extended his tour into the adjacent frontier of the sister country. He had visited, on the day that opens our history, some monastic ruins in the county of Dumfries, and spent much of the day in making drawings of them from different points, so that, on mounting his horse to resume his journey, the brief and gloomy twilight of the season had already commenced. His way lay through a wide tract of black moss, extending for miles on each side and before him. Little eminences arose like islands on its surface, bearing here and there patches of corn, which even at this season was green, and sometimes a hut or farm-house, shaded by a willow or two and surrounded by large elder-bushes. These insulated dwellings communicated with each other by winding passages through the moss, impassable by any but the natives themselves. The public road, however, was tolerably well made and safe, so that the prospect of being benighted brought with it no real danger. Still it is uncomfortable to travel alone and in the dark through an unknown country; and there are few ordinary occasions upon which Fancy frets herself so much as in <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of Mannering.|$|E
60|$|The queen {{perceived}} {{immediately that}} {{nothing but the}} most prompt and resolute action could enable her to escape the impending danger. She had but little bodily strength remaining, but that little was stimulated and renewed by the mental resolution and energy which, as is usual in temperaments like hers, burned all the brighter {{in proportion to the}} urgency of the danger which called it into action. She rose from her sick bed, and began to concert measures for making her escape. She confided her plan to three trusty friends, one gentleman, one lady, and her confessor, who, as her spiritual teacher and guide, was her constant companion. She disguised herself and these her attendants, and succeeded in getting through the gates of Exeter without attracting any observation. This was before Essex arrived. She found, however, before she went far, that the van of the army was approaching, and she had to seek refuge in a hut till her enemies had passed. She concealed herself among some straw, her attendants seeking such other hiding places as were at hand. It was two days before the bodies of soldiery had all passed so as to make it safe for the queen to come out of her retreat. The hut would seem to have been uninhabited, as the accounts state that she remained all this time without food, though this seems to be an almost incredible degree of privation and exposure for an English queen. At any rate, she remained during all this time in a state of great mental anxiety and alarm, for there were parties of soldiery constantly going by, with a tumult and noise which kept her in continual terror. Their harsh and dissonant voices, heard sometimes in angry quarrels and sometimes in mirth, were always frightful.

6000|$|On {{my return}} home, I {{went to a}} reading-room that I have frequented during our {{residence}} here, where I found {{a good deal of}} feeling excited by the news from America. The Swiss, I have told you, with very few exceptions, wish us well, but I take it nothing would give greater satisfaction to a large majority of the upper classes in most of the other countries of Europe, than to hear that the American republic was broken up: if buttons and broadcloths could be sent after us, it is not too much to add, or sent to the nether world. This feeling does not proceed so much from inherent dislike to us, as to our institutions. As a people, I rather think we are regarded with great indifference by the mass; but they who so strongly detest our institutions and deprecate our example, cannot prevent a little personal hatred from mingling with their political antipathies. Unlike the woman who was for beginning her love [...] "with a little aversion," [...] they begin with a little philanthropy, and end with a strong dislike for all that comes from the land they hate. I have known this feeling carried so far as to refuse credit even to the productions of the earth! I saw strong evidences of this truth, among several of the temporary habitués of the reading-room in question, most of whom were French. A speedy dissolution of the American Union was proclaimed in all the journals, on account of some fresh intelligence {{from the other side of}} the Atlantic; and I dare say that, at this moment, nine-tenths of the Europeans, who think at all on the subject, firmly and honestly believe that our institutions are not worth two years' purchase. This opinion is very natural, because falsehood is so artfully blended with truth, in what is published, that it requires a more intimate knowledge of the country to separate them, than a stranger can possess. I spent an hour to-day in a fruitless attempt to demonstrate to a very sensible Frenchman that nothing serious was to be apprehended from the present dispute, but all my logic was thrown away, and nothing but time will convince him of that which he is so strongly predisposed not to believe. They rarely send proper diplomatic men among us, in the first place; for <b>a</b> novel <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> in America requires a fertile and congenial mind,--and then your diplomatist is usually so much disposed to tell every one that which he wishes to hear! We mislead, too, ourselves, by the exaggerations of the opposition. Your partizan writes himself into a fever, and talks like any other man whose pulse is unnatural. This fact ought to be a matter of no surprise, since it is one of the commonest foibles of man to dislike most the evils that press on him most; although an escape from them to any other might even entail destruction. It is the old story of King Log and King Stork. As democracy is in the ascendant, they revile democracy, while we all feel persuaded we should be destroyed, or muzzled, under any other form of government. A few toad-eaters and court butterflies excepted, I do not believe there is a man in all America who could dwell five years in any country in Europe, without being made sensible of the vast superiority of his own free institutions over those of every other Christian nation.|$|R

She bent her beautiful eyes upon the work with which she was busied, and with infinite gravity sate out the two first turns of the matrons upon the balcony; but then, glancing her deep blue eye a little towards Roland, and observing the embarrassment under which he laboured, now shifting on his chair, and now dangling his cap, the whole man evincing that he was perfectly at a loss how to open the conversation, she could keep her composure no longer, but after a vain struggle broke out into a sincere, though a very involuntary fit of laughing, so richly accompanied by the laughter of her merry eyes, which actually glanced through the tears which the effort filled them with, and by the waving of her rich tresses, that the goddess of smiles herself never looked more lovely than Catherine at that moment. A court page would not have left her long alone in her mirth; but Roland was country-bred, and, besides, having some jealousy as well as bashfulness, he took it into his head that he was himself the object of her inextinguishable laughter. His endeavours to sympathize with Catherine, therefore, could carry him no farther than a forced giggle, which had more of displeasure than of mirth in it, and which so much enhanced that of the girl, that it seemed to render it impossible for her ever to bring her laughter to an end, with whatever anxious pains she laboured to do so. For every one has felt, that when a paroxysm of laughter has seized him at a misbecoming time and place, the efforts which he made to suppress it, nay, the very sense of the impropriety of giving way to it, tend only to augment and prolong the irresistible impulse.|$|R

60|$|Such {{is one of}} {{the modes}} in which the opinion of the {{dominant}} country tends to act more injuriously than beneficially on the conduct of its deputed governors. In other respects, its interference is likely to be oftenest exercised where it will be most pertinaciously demanded, and that is, on behalf of some interest of the English settlers. English settlers have friends at home, have organs, have access to the public; they have a common language, and common ideas with their countrymen; any complaint by an Englishman is more sympathetically heard, even if no unjust preference is intentionally accorded to it. Now if there be a fact to which all experience testifies, it is that, when a country holds another in subjection, the individuals of the ruling people who resort to the foreign country to make their fortunes are of all others those who most need to be held under powerful restraint. They are always one of the chief difficulties of the government. Armed with the prestige and filled with the scornful overbearingness of the conquering nation, they have the feelings inspired by absolute power without its sense of responsibility. Among a people <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of India, the utmost efforts of the public authorities are not enough for the effectual protection of the weak against the strong; and of all the strong, the European settlers are the strongest. Wherever the demoralizing effect of the situation is not in a most remarkable degree corrected by the personal character of the individual, they think the people of the country mere dirt under their feet: it seems to them monstrous that any rights of the natives should {{stand in the way of}} their smallest pretensions; the simplest act of protection to the inhabitants against any act of power on their part which they may consider useful to their commercial objects they denounce, and sincerely regard as an injury. So natural is this state of feeling in <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> theirs, <b>that,</b> even under the discouragement which it has hitherto met with from the ruling authorities, it is impossible that more or less of the spirit should not perpetually break out. The government, itself free from this spirit, is never able sufficiently to keep it down in the young and raw even of its own civil and military officers, over whom it has so much more control than over the independent residents. As it is with the English in India, so, according to trustworthy testimony, it is with the French in Algiers; so with the Americans in the countries conquered from Mexico; so it seems to be with the Europeans in China, and already even in Japan: there is no necessity to recall how it was with the Spaniards in South America. In all these cases, the government to which these private adventurers are subject is better than they, and does the most it can to protect the natives against them. Even the Spanish government did this, sincerely and earnestly, though ineffectually, as is known to every reader of Mr. Helps' instructive history. Had the Spanish government been directly accountable to Spanish opinion, we may question if it would have made the attempt, for the Spaniards, doubtless, would have taken part with their Christian friends and relations rather than with pagans. The settlers, not the natives, have the ear of the public at home; it is they whose representations are likely to pass for truth, because they alone have both the means and the motive to press them perseveringly upon the inattentive and uninterested public mind. The distrustful criticism with which Englishmen, more than any other people, are in the habit of scanning the conduct of their country towards foreigners, they usually reserve for the proceedings of the public authorities. In all questions between a government and an individual, the presumption in every Englishman's mind is that the government is in the wrong. And when the resident English bring the batteries of English political action to bear upon any of the bulwarks erected to protect the natives against their encroachments, the executive, with their real but faint velleities of something better, generally find it safer to their Parliamentary interest, and, at any rate, less troublesome, to give up the disputed position than to defend it.|$|R
