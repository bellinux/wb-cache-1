40|$|BACKGROUND: Compared with {{screening}} {{programs for}} breast and cervical cancer, reported participation rates for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening are low. The {{effectiveness of a}} screening program is strongly influenced by the participation rate. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the main reasons not to participate in a population-based, invitational CRC screening program. METHODS: In the Dutch study program for CRC screening, a random selection of 20 623 persons were invited received a faecal occult blood test. Of the non-participants, 500 were randomly selected and contacted for <b>a</b> standardized <b>telephone</b> <b>interview</b> <b>from</b> November 2006 to May 2007 to document the main reason not to participate. RESULTS: In total, 312 (62 %) non-participants could be included for analysis. Most frequently, reported reasons for non-participation were time-related or priority-related (36 %), including 'did not notice test in mailbox' (13 %) and 'forgot' (8 %). Other reasons were health-related issues, such as 'severe illness' (9 %), or emotional reasons, such as 'family circumstances' (7 %). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the reported reasons not to participate reflect low priority for screening. Adding extra instructions and information, and addressing specific concerns through additional interventions should be considered to improve individual decision-making about participation in future CRC population-based screening programs...|$|R

40|$|Background: Growth {{oriented}} entrepreneurial businesses need {{funding for}} the development of their idea, technology, product etc. However, for the businesses in the very earliest stages of development, access to funding is very limited. Growing young ventures are important job creators and positively affect growth in an economy. Bridging the gap of funding to these companies is therefore on the agenda of governments around the world. Purpose: To describe the situation facing seed stage investing venture capitalists. I will emphasize difficulties and evaluate venture capitalists ability in addressing them. Effects of the difficulties in form of access to financing for entrepreneurs and a possible need for government intervention will be examined. Method: Empirical information from seed stage investing venture capital organizations have been collected in the form of face-to-face interviews, email- questionnaires and <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>interview.</b> Organizations <b>from</b> Sweden, Denmark and Germany are included in the study. Result: Several factors make seed stage investing unattractive compared to later stages. Important difficulties are higher risks, high costs for fund management, goal incongruence in the investor – venture capitalist relation and lack of bargaining power for seed venture capitalists. Environmental factorsthat have an impact on seed investing are the deal flow, the investment climate and access to soft funding. Seed stage investing is a very challenging business and the difficulties are to a large extent hard to overcome. The investors more likely have to accept them and I conclude that long term profitability of seed funds is unlikely, at least in absence of government support in form of soft funding towards the entrepreneurial businesses...|$|R

METHODS General distress was measured by a short form of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression. Multiple regression analysis was conducted on self-report data (based on <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>interview)</b> <b>from</b> a probability-based sample of US women aged 25 – 45 years. We compare women with infertility {{who have had a}} prior pregnancy (secondary infertility, n = 628) to women with infertility with no prior pregnancies (primary infertility, n = 399). We further distinguish between women with infertility who were actually ‘trying’ to become pregnant (the infertile with intent) with those who met the medical definition of infertile but did not describe themselves as trying to become pregnant (infertile without intent). RESULTS Both types of infertility (primary versus secondary) (β = 0. 31 *) and intentionality (infertile with and without intent) (β = 0. 08 *) are associated with FSD. These associations persist when we control for resource and demographic variables, life course variables, social support and social pressure variables. General distress does not vary by infertility type or intentionality.

The purpose of this study, therefore, was to describe the patients who visited two commonly-owned FECs, and determine the reasons for their visits. An economic model of the demand for FEC care was developed to test its ability to predict the economic and sociodemographic factors of use. Demand analysis of other forms of ambulatory services, such as a regular source of care (RSOC), was also conducted to examine the issues of substitution and complementarity. ^ A systematic random sample was chosen from all private patients who used the clinics between July 1 and December 31, 1981. Data were obtained by means of <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>interview</b> and <b>from</b> clinic records. Five hundred fifty-one patients participated in the study. ^ The typical FEC patient was a 26 year old white male with a minimum of a high school education, and a family income exceeding 25, 000 a year. He had lived in the area for at least twenty years, and was a professional or a clerical worker. The patients made an average of 1. 26 visits to the FECs in 1981. The majority of the visits involved a medical complaint; injuries and preventive care were the next most common reasons for visits. ^ The analytic results revealed that time played a relatively important role in the demand for FEC care. As waiting time at the patients 2 ̆ 7 regular source of care increased, the demand for FEC care increased, indicating that the clinic serves as a substitute for the patients 2 ̆ 7 usual means of care. Age and education were inversely related to the demand for FEC care, while those with a RSOC frequented the clinics less than those lacking such a source. ^ The patients used the familiar forms of ambulatory care, such as a private physician or an emergency room in a more typical fashion. These visits were directly related to the age and education of the patients, existence of a regular source of care, and disability days, which is a measure of health status. ...|$|R

We tried to compare patient's assessment of primary (family physician, general practitioner, internist, pediatrician, and general surgeon) and non-primary (the other specialties) care physicians. Methods: Study subjects were physicians of primary care clinics in Seoul. The study subject evaluators were Seoul citizens who were selected by a list-assisted random digit dialing sampling method and who had visited their primary care clinic on six or more occasions over a period of more than 6 months as a usual source of care. The modified version of the Korean Primary Care Assessment Tool was used for the evaluation of primary care performance.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate what farmers view is on the animal welfare inspections done by regional Swedish authorities as well as the animal welfare inspectors work. The study investigated whether or not there were any differences between different counties in Sweden. There were also questions asked to see what animal producers thought could change in the animal welfare inspectors work so it would benefit them. The study was conducted using <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>interview</b> questionnaire. Answers <b>from</b> 36 animal producers were gathered from four different counties; Skåne, Halland, Dalarna and Östergötland. The main results were that more than half of the animal producers are of the opinion that animal welfare inspectors have inadequate experience of practical work with farm animals. It was also shown that animal producers find that animal welfare inspector have a better theoretical knowledge of animals and animal welfare legislation than they have of practical experience with animals. The animal producers in the study seem to be satisfied with how animal welfare inspectors treated them when they were conducting the animal welfare inspection. Some of the animal producers thought that the animal welfare inspections need to be more standardized between different inspectors and between the different counties. Similar views were shown in a study by Anneberg et al. (2012) were farmers request a control system which is objective and judge different farms on the same scale in the same way. There were some differences between the four different counties that were investigated in the study, but more data needs to be collected to make general conclusions. Scientific research in the field of animal producers views of animal welfare inspections and the work of animal welfare inspectors work is inadequate and further studies should be considered necessary.

40|$|Abstract Background Screening {{instruments}} for mental disorders {{need to be}} short, engaging, and valid. Current screening instruments are usually questionnaire-based and may be opaque to the user. A prototype approach where individuals identify {{with a description of}} an individual with typical symptoms of depression, anxiety, social phobia or panic may be a shorter, faster and more acceptable method for screening. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the accuracy of four new prototype screeners for predicting depression and anxiety disorders and to compare their performance with existing scales. Methods Short and ultra-short prototypes were developed for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Panic Disorder (PD) and Social Phobia (SP). Prototypes were compared to typical short and ultra-short self-report screening scales, such as the Centre for Epidemiology Scale, CES-D and the GAD- 7, and their short forms. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) version 6 1 was used as the gold standard for obtaining clinical criteria through <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>interview.</b> <b>From</b> a population sample, 225 individuals who endorsed a prototype and 101 who did not were administered the MINI. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted for the short and ultra short prototypes and for the short and ultra short screening scales. Results The study found that the rates of endorsement of the prototypes were commensurate with prevalence estimates. The short-form and ultra short scales outperformed the short and ultra short prototypes for every disorder except GAD, where the GAD prototype outperformed the GAD 7. Conclusions The findings suggest that people may be able to self-identify generalised anxiety more accurately than depression based on a description of a prototypical case. However, levels of identification were lower than expected. Considerable benefits from this method of screening may ensue if our prototypes can be improved for Major Depressive Disorder, Social Phobia and Panic Disorder. </p...|$|E
