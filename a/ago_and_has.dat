5|$|The episode {{features}} the alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) being {{captured by the}} Daleks, along with his companions Amy (Karen Gillan) and Rory (Arthur Darvill), who are about to divorce. They are sent by the Daleks to the Asylum, a planet where insane Daleks are exiled, to enable the Asylum to be destroyed before the insane Daleks can escape. The Doctor is helped along the way by Oswin Oswald (Jenna-Louise Coleman), a woman whose spaceship had crashed on the planet a year <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> <b>has</b> been trapped there since then.|$|E
5|$|The {{wealth of}} galaxies at {{different}} stages of their evolution also allowed astronomers to estimate the variation in the rate of star formation over the lifetime of the Universe. While estimates of the redshifts of HDF galaxies are somewhat crude, astronomers believe that star formation was occurring at its maximum rate 8–10 billion years <b>ago,</b> <b>and</b> <b>has</b> decreased by a factor of about 10 since then.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of general relativity is that it {{can be applied to the}} universe as a whole. A key point is that, on large scales, our universe appears to be constructed along very simple lines: all current observations suggest that, on average, the structure of the cosmos should be approximately the same, regardless of an observer's location or direction of observation: the universe is approximately homogeneous and isotropic. Such comparatively simple universes can be described by simple solutions of Einstein's equations. The current cosmological models of the universe are obtained by combining these simple solutions to general relativity with theories describing the properties of the universe's matter content, namely thermodynamics, nuclear- and particle physics. According to these models, our present universe emerged from an extremely dense high-temperature state –the Big Bang– roughly 14 billion years <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> <b>has</b> been expanding ever since.|$|E

5|$|Sophie arrives {{while they}} argue and is lured upstairs; the Doctor and Craig follow, {{learning}} from Amy that Craig's building {{has never had}} a second floor. Inside, they find an alien ship housing a primitive time engine. The ship crashed some time <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> <b>has</b> used a perception filter to disguise itself as part of Craig's house. The ship's emergency holographic program has been drawing in passersby, all who have a desire to escape, to find a replacement pilot for itself, but they were killed in the attempt. The machine identifies the Doctor as a possible pilot and tries to draw him to the controls, but the Doctor warns that if he should touch the controls, the ship could explode and take the solar system with it. The Doctor convinces Craig to touch the controls since {{he does not want to}} leave due to his love for Sophie, which will counteract the ship's protocols. Craig does so, and he and Sophie admit their love and share a kiss that breaks the ship's hold on the Doctor and themselves. The three escape in time to see the perception filter turn off and the ship implode, leaving Craig's undamaged one-story flat below.|$|E
25|$|The {{first school}} {{focuses on the}} ideological factors which are claimed to drive the caste system and holds that caste {{is rooted in the}} four varnas. This {{perspective}} was particularly common among scholars of the British colonial era and was articulated by Dumont, who concluded that the system was ideologically perfected several thousand years <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> <b>has</b> remained the primary social reality ever since. This school justifies its theory primarily by citing the ancient law book Manusmriti and disregards economic, political or historical evidence.|$|E

The Koperattiva tal-Barklori is a co-operative of boat owners who try to preserve the few remaining dgħajsas.

Trachyte flows move more slowly than the typically [...] "runny" [...] Hawaiian lavas, a characteristic caused by its high (over 62%) silica composition (typical basalt is only 50% silica). Geologists hypothesize that Puu Waawaa originally formed during a pumice eruption a little over 100,000years <b>ago,</b> <b>and</b> <b>has</b> continued to build itself since then, with at least three distinct trachyte flows recognized. The eruptions, although partially covered by flows from Hualālai and Mauna Loa, have built a distinctive structure known as the Puu Anahulu ridge.|$|E

500|$|The Mount Edziza {{volcanic}} complex began forming about 7.5 {{million years}} <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> <b>has</b> grown steadily since then. Like other volcanoes in northwestern British Columbia, the Mount Edziza volcanic complex has {{its origins in}} continental rifting—a long divergent plate boundary where the lithosphere is being pulled apart. Here, the continental crust of the North American Plate is being stretched {{at a rate of}} about [...] per year. This incipient rifting has formed as a result of the Pacific Plate sliding northward along the Queen Charlotte Fault, on its way to the Aleutian Trench, which extends along the southern coastline of Alaska and the adjacent waters of northeastern Siberia off the coast of Kamchatka Peninsula. As the continental crust stretches, the [...] near-surface rocks fracture along steeply dipping cracks parallel to the rift known as faults. Hot basaltic magma rises along these fractures to create passive lava eruptions, known as effusive eruptions.|$|E
500|$|The Wells Gray-Clearwater {{volcanic}} field began forming approximately 3,500,000 years <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> <b>has</b> grown steadily since then. The tectonic {{causes of}} the volcanism that have produced the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field are not yet clear {{and are therefore a}} matter of ongoing research. It is approximately [...] inland from the north-south trending Garibaldi Volcanic Belt and is along-strike from the Nootka Fault on the British Columbia Coast, which has been subducting under the North American Plate at the Cascadia subduction zone. The Wells Gray volcanics are mostly alkali olivine basalt, with some lava flows comprising mantle xenoliths. Basalts of the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field have been considered to be the easternmost expression of the Anahim Volcanic Belt. However, its relationship is unknown because the age-location trend does not reach into the Wells Gray-Clearwater area, and the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field is not along trend with the Anahim Volcanic Belt. The Wells Gray volcanics were thought to have formed by crustal thinning and the existence of crustal penetrating structures.|$|E

Ray collects his children, steals a car and drives to Mary Ann's home in suburban New Jersey to take refuge. The next morning, he discovers that a Boeing 747 has crashed in the street. A news team scavenging for food while surveying the wreckage explain that there are multiple Tripods that have attacked major cities including New York City, Paris, Washington, D.C., and London, and have force shields to protect them from human weapons. They also explain that the Martians travelled to Earth within the lightning, as a guise to enter the Tripods. Ray decides to take the kids to Boston to be with their mother. The three are forced to abandon the stolen car after a mob takes it by force. They later survive a Tripod attack which causes a Hudson River ferry to sink. During a desperate battle between U.S. Marines and the aliens, Ray is forced to choose between being separated from Rachel and preventing Robbie from joining the fight; he lets Robbie go with the Marines, who are overwhelmed, thus making Ray presume Robbie died during the attack. While escaping, Ray and Rachel are offered shelter by a paramedic, Harlan Ogilvy, who presumes that the aliens had buried their technology on Earth millions of years <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> <b>has</b> delusions that they can fight against the aliens themselves by observing their operations, as they are right next to their camp.|$|E

The longhouse differed from later types of house in that it had a central row of posts [...] under the roof ridge. It was therefore not three- but four-aisled. To start with, cattle were kept outside overnight in Hürden or pens. With the transition of agriculture to permanent fields the cattle were brought into the house, which then became a so-called Wohnstallhaus or byre-dwelling.|$|E
