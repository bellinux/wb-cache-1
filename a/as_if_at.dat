25|$|Though {{initiated}} in 1889, {{the project to}} create a Shakespeare statue in Ballarat was not completed until 1960. Financial problems led to repeated shelving of the project. Eventually private donations to the fund produced sufficient resources to commission a bronze sculpture from Andor Meszaros, an Australian artist originally from Hungary. The statue depicts Shakespeare bowing, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of a}} performance.|$|E
25|$|Carol's {{regime has}} {{generally}} been viewed <b>as</b> (<b>if</b> <b>at</b> all) superficially fascist, and endorsed by the United Kingdom and France {{as a means to}} present a line of defense against Nazism in the Balkans (the Western press held, overall, a sympathetic view of the FRN). The Front adopted fascist symbols and discourse. After January 1939, party members wore uniforms (navy blue or white in color), with various ceremonial hats. The Roman salute was a mandatory greeting.|$|E
500|$|Zaidi {{had claimed}} that the forms state the names, {{identification}} numbers and information about the voters and {{are supposed to be}} signed by the voters themselves as well as their witnesses. However, the election agents noticed that the same witness would sign differently on different forms. On some forms, the voters themselves did not even sign them. Zaidi concluded by saying that it meant that others had signed on their behalf. He added that only after persistent complaints from the PR’s election agents, Election Commission officials agreed to consider 208 ballot papers from the postal votes as spoilt votes. He also said that they have found at least between 700 and 800 more postal votes that had discrepancies but the EC disallowed these from being considered as spoilt. Zaidi finally claimed that [...] if the by-election had truly been run properly, DAP could have won with a much bigger majority <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>at</b> least 700 more postal votes were rejected as spoilt, DAP could have won the polls with a majority of a little over 1,000.|$|E

500|$|The {{core of the}} album's {{instrumentation}} {{consists of}} organ, honky-tonk piano, and electronic bass played by the Beach Boys themselves, rather than the session musicians employed in much of their previous work. Brian became obsessed with a three-tiered Baldwin organ during the album's recording, resulting in a more minimalist approach to the new arrangements {{in addition to the}} album's central timbre. Tape manipulation was another prominent feature, varispeed being applied to a few miscellaneous vocals. On [...] "She's Goin' Bald", a new device called the Eltro Information Rate Changer was used to raise the pitch of the group's vocals without affecting the tempo. The album continued Brian's exploration of [...] "party tracks"—a form of music which includes the sounds of people shouting and making noises, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>at</b> a party. Mike Love, recalling how [...] "She's Goin' Bald" [...] was a song about fellatio, commented: [...] "We were stoned out of our heads. We were laughing our asses off when we recorded that stuff." [...] Brian had previously enacted this approach with Beach Boys' Party! in 1965, thereby mixing that record's style with the modular composition method he devised for [...] "Good Vibrations".|$|E

2500|$|A further secular {{development}} was the portrait historié, where groups of portrait sitters posed as historical or mythological figures.

2500|$|Cedric Bixler took {{responsibility}} for the breakup, saying repeatedly in interviews that he felt almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>At</b> the Drive-In was holding him back and that he didn't want his music to be confined to punk or hardcore — that it should encompass many genres and be even more progressive, alternative, and [...] "against-the-grain." [...] Bixler-Zavala and Rodriguez-Lopez had stated that they wanted their next album to sound like Pink Floyd's The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, while the other members were intent on progressing in a more alternative rock direction.|$|E
2500|$|A brothel may not {{in itself}} be shocking. But women painted without charm or sadness, without irony or social comment, women painted like the palings of a stockade through eyes that look out <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>at</b> death – that is shocking.

He was also influenced – particularly in the two heads at the right – by African masks…here it seems that Picasso’s quotations are simple, direct, and emotional. He is not in the least concerned with formal problems. The dislocations in this picture are the result of aggression, not aesthetics; it is the nearest you can get in a painting to an outrage… ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{story of}} Titus Andronicus is fictional, not {{historical}}, unlike Shakespeare's other Roman plays, Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra, and Coriolanus, {{all of which}} are based on real historical events and people. Even the time in which Titus is set may not be based on a real historical period. According to the prose version of the play (see below), the events are [...] "set in the time of Theodosius", who ruled from 379 to 395. On the other hand, the general setting appears to be what Clifford Huffman describes as [...] "late-Imperial Christian Rome", possibly during the reign of Justinian I (527–565). Also favouring a later date, Grace Starry West argues, [...] "the Rome of Titus Andronicus is Rome after Brutus, after Caesar, and after Ovid. We know it is a later Rome because the emperor is routinely called Caesar; because the characters are constantly alluding to Tarquin, Lucretia, and Brutus, suggesting that they learned about Brutus' new founding of Rome from the same literary sources we do, Livy and Plutarch." [...] Others are less certain of a specific setting, however. For example, Jonathan Bate has pointed out that the play begins with Titus returning from a successful ten-year campaign against the Goths, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>at</b> the height of the Roman Empire, but ends with Goths invading Rome, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>at</b> its death. Similarly, T. J. B. Spencer argues that [...] "the play does not assume a political situation known to Roman history; it is, rather a summary of Roman politics. It is not so much that any particular set of political institutions is assumed in Titus, but rather that it includes all the political institutions that Rome ever had." ...|$|E
2500|$|In chapter 17, the jötunn Hrungnir {{finds himself}} in Asgard, {{the realm of the}} gods, and becomes very drunk. Hrungnir boasts that he will move Valhalla to Jötunheimr, bury Asgard, and kill all of the gods—with the {{exception}} of the goddesses Freyja and Sif, who he says he will take home with him. Freyja {{is the only one of}} them that dares to bring him more to drink. Hrungnir says that he will drink all of their ale. After a while, the gods grow bored of Hrungnir's antics and invoke the name of Thor. Thor immediately enters the hall, hammer raised. Thor is furious and demands to know who is responsible for letting a jötunn in to Asgard, who guaranteed Hrungnir safety, and why Freyja [...] "should be serving him drink <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>at</b> the Æsir's banquet." ...|$|E
2500|$|As the new decade dawned, Marriott {{appeared}} at the Flatbush Theater in a revival of Langston Hughes' melodrama, Mulatto. In 1941 he reprised {{his role in the}} William Wyler film version of The Little Foxes, which stars Bette Davis. Marriott was one of five members of the original Broadway cast to appear in the film. After his foray into film, he would return to New York to focus on his stage career over the next decade. In 1941 he appeared in the production of The Pursuit of Happiness, starring Francis Lederer at the Flatbush Theater. In 1942, he originated the role of Rodney in Janie, which ran for 642 performances at five different theaters from 1942–44. The play would be made into a film by Michael Curtiz in 1942, although Marriott was not selected for the film's cast. Marriott would also appear in regional theater productions, as he did in a 1944 version of Elena Miramova's play, Dark Eyes in Stamford, Connecticut. Also in 1944, he appeared in the Broadway production of No Way Out, at the Cort Theater. In 1946 he appeared in the role of Dr. Einstein in the all-Black production of Arsenic and Old Lace, in the debut production of the McKinley Square Players, which starred Abbie Mitchell, Ruby Dee, and Avon Long. Also in 1946 he originated the role of Joe Mott, one of the major parts in the Eugene O'Neill classic, The Iceman Cometh, which opened at the Martin Beck Theatre on October 9. Marriott was the only Black member of the cast, and after the play opened he said, [...] "I've enjoyed this part more than any I've ever done. Joe Mott, the character I portray, is a real part in the story. This looks <b>as</b> <b>if,</b> <b>at</b> last, there might be a breaking away from the usual type-casting of butlers or valets Negroes formerly had to do." ...|$|E
