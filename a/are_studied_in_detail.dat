2500|$|There are 25 species {{belonging}} to the genus Takifugu. Most species are restricted to salt and brackish waters of the northwest Pacific, but a few are found in freshwater of Asia or more widely in the Indo-Pacific region. Their diet consists mostly of algae, mollusks, invertebrates and sometimes crustaceans. All fishes in the tetradon family have strong teeth that may grow too long if the fish cannot consume abrasive food. Fugu can bite if provoked. Not all species <b>are</b> <b>studied</b> <b>in</b> <b>detail,</b> but the most researched takifugu is Takifugu rubripes, due to the commercial consumption and breeding of the fish. [...] Takifugu rubripes, for example, breeds from March to May and lays eggs attached to rocks {{at a depth of}} around 20m. Fugu can also change color over time, and they get a darker or lighter color. This helps them to camouflage. [...] A very dark color may be a sign of stress or illness.|$|E

The relationships of the genus Cethosia (sometimes treated as a tribe of its own) are even more mysterious, and it is likely that some other genera will eventually also be moved to a different tribe as they <b>are</b> <b>studied</b> <b>in</b> <b>detail.</b> Some, like the Argynnini Argynnis, Boloria and Issoria, might be overlumped and non-monophyletic and thus some genera presently usually considered junior synonyms of them might eventually be validated like Telchinia.|$|E
