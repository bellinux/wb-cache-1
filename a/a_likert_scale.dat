5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} refers to {{issues at the}} theoretical foundations of modern psychology. Some of these issues are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of behavior to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on mental perception and thought processes? If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases {{in which there is}} no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on <b>a</b> <b>Likert</b> <b>scale,</b> they may be experiencing very different things.|$|E

Questions cover a range of desirable criteria that future doctors should possess.|$|E

2500|$|The Connectedness to Nature Scale (CNS). This scale {{measures}} how emotionally {{connected people}} feel {{to the natural}} world, animals, and plants. It also assesses people's perceived equality between nature and themselves. An example of an item is [...] "I recognize and appreciate the intelligence of other living organisms." [...] These items are rated on <b>a</b> <b>Likert</b> <b>scale</b> from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) where higher scores demonstrate a higher connection to nature. This scale can be used both at the trait and state level. The state version is 13-items and shows acceptable reliability (α = [...]91,). The trait version is 14-items and also demonstrates good reliability (α = [...]82). This scale's validity is demonstrated by its positive associations with other environmental scales (such as the New Ecological Paradigm Scale) but is not associated with verbal ability or social desirability. See also Connectedness to nature scale.|$|E
2500|$|The Nature Relatedness {{measure is}} a 21-item scale that {{measures}} how connected to nature participants feel at a trait level. Participants indicate their agreement with each statement using <b>a</b> <b>Likert</b> <b>scale.</b> There are 3 subscales to this measure; NR- self, NR- perspective, and NR- experience. NR-self measures how much individuals identify with nature (e.g., “I feel very connected to {{all living things}} and the earth”), NR-perspective measures how concerned individuals may feel {{about the effect of}} human actions on the environment (e.g., “Humans have the right to use natural resources any way we want”), and NR- Experience measures how comfortable individuals are in nature and their desire to be involved with nature (e.g., “I enjoy being outdoors, even in unpleasant weather”). This scale shows good reliability, alpha = [...]87 and test-retest stability six months later, alpha = [...]85. There is also a brief Nature Relatedness Scale made up of 6 items from the original 21 items. The purpose of this scale is to measure how connected an individual feels to nature but in a shorter way. This scale shows good reliability, alpha = [...]87 and test-retest stability six months later, alpha = [...]88.|$|E

2500|$|FWP {{essentially}} {{abandoned its}} definition of [...] "solitude" [...] and a high-quality recreational experience after floater surveys showed that—despite significantly exceeding total daily user and average group size guidelines in 1996, 1997, 1999, 2003, 2006, and 2007—floaters were overwhelmingly highly {{satisfied with their}} float experience. [...] "FWP concluded {{that the number of}} groups and {{the number of people in}} the corridor at one time is useful in terms of boat camp capacities but is less effective for determining acceptable social conditions. ... A more useful indicator for quality of experience is the number of times a person encounters other boats on the river during the course of a day." [...] But the final rule continued to employ the existing indicators (number of launches per day and maximum group size). A new indicator, <b>a</b> <b>Likert</b> <b>scale</b> asking floaters [...] "to rate their level of satisfaction with the number of other boats they observed on the river", was also established to help identify [...] "solitude". New management efforts, such as outreach to reduce public expectations of solitude, incentives to reduce group size or the number of watercraft used by a group, and even closure of boat camps were contemplated. Limited restrictions were imposed on local landowners, however. The number outfitters was reduced from 16 to nine, after an FWP analysis showed that outfitters were trading permits and that only nine outfitters were actively engaged in floating the Smith.|$|E

50|$|A good Likert scale, as above, {{will present}} a {{symmetry}} of categories about a midpoint with clearly defined linguistic qualifiers. In such symmetric scaling, equidistant attributes will typically be more clearly observed or, at least, inferred. It is when <b>a</b> <b>Likert</b> <b>scale</b> is symmetric and equidistant that it will behave more like an interval-level measurement. So while <b>a</b> <b>Likert</b> <b>scale</b> is indeed ordinal, if well presented it may nevertheless approximate an interval-level measurement. This can be beneficial since, if it was treated just as an ordinal scale, then some valuable information could be lost if the ‘distance’ between Likert items were not available for consideration.
