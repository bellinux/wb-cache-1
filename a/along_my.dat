McCain said: [...] "You don't make things better by making it easier. Its speed that does the damage." [...] Champion jockey Tony McCoy also defended the National, saying, [...] "I personally don't think the sport could be in any better shape for horses or jockeys." [...] Ornais's owner, Andy Stewart, later said: [...] "We're still grieving but I think this whole hyped up situation regarding the Grand National is totally wrong...

500|$|After {{releasing}} two solo albums, Love. Angel. Music. Baby (2004) and The Sweet Escape (2006), Stefani {{returned to}} work with her band No Doubt. In 2012 they released their sixth studio album, Push and Shove. During that time, she claimed, [...] "I never need to do that or want to do it again. I'm happy being in No Doubt."

In September, during an interview for MTV News during New York Fashion Week, she confirmed to be working on a solo album and a No Doubt album, stating, [...] "I'm going into the studio tonight with Pharrell , I'm going to be writing and also just seeing what comes <b>along</b> <b>my</b> way.

500|$|After {{giving birth}} to her third son on February 28, 2014, Stefani made her first public {{appearance}} at the 2014 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 12, 2014, performing [...] "Hollaback Girl" [...] {{at the request of}} her longtime collaborator and friend Pharrell Williams, {{who was one of the}} festival's headliners. After the performance, Williams hinted at a possible return for the singer. In September 2014, she revealed she was writing for two records: her third solo studio album and her band No Doubt's seventh studio album. She told MTV news: [...] "At this point I'm thinking about both, I can do both. [...] And it's just an amazing time; so many opportunities. I'm going into the studio tonight with Pharrell , I'm going to be writing and also just seeing what comes <b>along</b> <b>my</b> way. I've been recording a few things." [...] In the same month, Stefani's manager Irving Azoff confirmed she was finishing the record with Williams, as well as planning to perform its lead single live on The Voice. Interscope chairman John Janick also revealed that producer Benny Blanco would be the album's executive producer and that it was slated to be released sometime in December 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Ozu {{once said}} of Noda: [...] "When a {{director}} {{works with a}} scriptwriter they must have some characteristics and habits in common; otherwise, they won't get <b>along.</b> <b>My</b> daily life—what time I get up, how much sake I drink and so on—is in almost complete agreement with that of [...] When I work with Noda, we collaborate even on short bits of dialogue. Although we never discuss {{the details of the}} sets or costumes, his mental image of these things is always in accord with mine; our ideas never criss cross or go awry. We even agree on whether a dialogue should end with wa or yo." [...] From Late Spring on, partly due to Noda's influence, all Ozu’s characters would be comfortably middle class and thus, unlike the characters in, for example, Record of a Tenement Gentleman or A Hen in the Wind, beyond immediate physical want and necessity.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, when Yang Yi {{was serving}} as a Master of Writing (尚書), Jiang Wan ranked lower than him, but {{both of them were}} later {{appointed}} as Chief Clerks under Zhuge Liang. Yang Yi viewed himself highly and saw himself as superior to Jiang Wan because he had been serving in Shu longer than Jiang. He openly expressed his dissatisfaction by grumbling and complaining. The others ignored him due to his poor choice of words in conveying his frustration, except for Fei Yi, who comforted him. Yang Yi once told Fei Yi, [...] "When the Chancellor (Zhuge Liang) died, I should have brought <b>along</b> <b>my</b> men and defected to Wei if I knew I'd end up in this situation today! I deeply regret but there's nothing I can do now." [...] Fei Yi secretly reported Yang Yi's speech to the Shu imperial court. In 235, Yang Yi was stripped off his appointment, demoted to the status of a commoner, and exiled to Hanjia Commandery (漢嘉郡; around present-day Lushan County, Sichuan). While he was in Hanjia, Yang Yi wrote a memorial to the Shu imperial court and used emotionally charged language to express his anger and lash out at the court. The court deemed Yang Yi's memorial defamatory so it ordered his arrest. Yang Yi committed suicide. His family returned to Chengdu after his death.|$|E
