40|$|Prior to the {{initiation}} of this study, understanding of the long-term behavior of environmentally-exposed Coal Combustion By-Products (CCBs) was lacking in (among others) two primary areas addressed in this work. First, no method had been successfully applied to achieve full quantitative analysis of the partitioning of chemical constituents into reactive or passive crystalline or noncrystalline compounds. Rather, only semi-quantitative methods were available, with large associated errors. Second, {{our understanding of the}} long-term behavior of various CCBs in contact with the natural environment was based on a relatively limited set of study materials. This study addressed these areas with two objectives, producing (1) a set of protocols for fully quantitative phase analysis using the Rietveld Quantitative X-ray Diffraction (RQXRD) method and (2) greater understanding of the hydrologic and geochemical nature of the long-term behavior of disposed and utilized CCBs. The RQXRD technique was initially tested using (1) mixtures of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) crystalline standards, and (2) mixtures of synthetic reagents simulating various CCBs, to determine accuracy and precision of the method, and to determine the most favorable protocols to follow in order to efficiently quantify multi-phase mixtures. Four sets of borehole samples of disposed or utilized CCBs were retrieved and analyzed by RQXRD according to the protocols developed under the first objective. The first set of samples, from a Class F <b>ash</b> <b>settling</b> <b>pond</b> in Kentucky disposed for up to 20 years, showed little mineralogical alteration, as expected. The second set of samples, from an embankment in Indiana containing a mixture of chain-grate (stoker) furnace ash and fluidized bed combustion (FBC) residues, showed formation of the mineral thaumasite, as observed in previously studied exposed FBC materials. Two high-calcium CCBs studied, including a dry-process flue gas desulfurization (FGD) by-product disposed in the Midwest, and a mixture of Class C fly ash and wet process FGD by-product codisposed in North Dakota, appeared relatively unchanged mineralogically over the up to 5 and 17 years of emplacement, respectively. Each of these two materials contained mineralogies consistent with short-term hydration products of their respective starting (dry) materials. The hydration product ettringite persisted throughout the duration of emplacement at each site, and the diagenetic ash alteration product thaumasite did not form at either site. Explanations for the absence of thaumasite in these two sites include a lack of significant carbonate, sulfate, and alkalinity sources {{in the case of the}} North Dakota site, and a lack of sulfate, alkalinity, and sufficient moisture in the Midwest site. Potential for future thaumasite formation in these materials may exist if placed in contact with cold, wet materials containing the missing components listed above. In the presence of the sulfite scrubber mineral hannebachite, the ettringites formed had crystallographic unit cell dimensions smaller than those of pure sulfate ettringite, suggesting either incorporation of sulfite ions into the ettringite structure, or incorporation of silicon and carbonate ions, forming a solid solution towards thaumasite...|$|E

These buildings will continue to remain and there are plans to extend the National Grid substation. The rest of the power station site is unused brownfield land. The site of the main station buildings is currently covered in crushed concrete, left over from the demolition process. Underground workings, such as tunnels and culverts, also still exist on the site.

500|$|Pulverised Fuel Ash (PFA) and Furnace Bottom Ash (FBA) were {{byproducts}} produced {{through the}} burning of coal in the station. Bottom ash was removed from ash hoppers {{at the bottom of}} the boilers by high pressure water jets. It then travelled to <b>ash</b> <b>settling</b> <b>ponds</b> via sluiceways. For much of the station's life, the station was served by a series of barges, which took the ash to dump [...] out into the North Sea. Two barges provided this service over the years; Sir Fon and MVA. The barges were loaded by silos situated at a special dock to the east of the stations. However, dumping in the sea stopped in 1992 when the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships prevented further dumping in the North Sea. From then on FBA was sold to the construction industry, while PFA was either dried for sale, or was disposed of at a licensed landfill on-site.|$|R
50|$|On an {{overcast}} low ceiling day in 2008 {{a landslide}} occurred near Lake Deforest northernmost tip. This from an over blast {{at the site}} of the Haverstraw part of the Oldcastle CRH (aka Tilcon) mine pit. The single landslide grew in other ways, later more frequent rock slides onto public roads of 9w and huge piles of waste quarry ash appeared on the river and near Lake Deforest. It cast a 21st century pall of corruption and pollution over the populace of Haverstraw, New York State and in 2009 a small $350,000 fine was issued that included abusive violation to nearby public lands and the river's protected Shad, Sturgeon and other wildlife. In the years following a series of fines (all rather tiny in context) were issued to CRH Oldcastle, a name hardly anyone knows. Drinking waters/breathing polluted unfiltered air became a reality. The unmanaged and insufficient outfall pollution control areas were overwhelmed easily by their poor cost saving design, clogged by quarry waste <b>ash</b> muck the <b>settling</b> <b>ponds</b> simply allowed the storm runoffs from massive coal style flat topped surge piles to pollute the river during rains. Shad and the ancient sturgeon were not warned when it happened.|$|R

40|$|A passive {{treatment}} system was originally established {{in late spring}} 2006 for abatement of metal content and acidity in drainage from waste material of an abandoned quarry. The system consisted of a 1 st <b>settling</b> <b>pond,</b> a SAPS (Successive Alkalinity Producing System), a 2 nd <b>settling</b> <b>pond,</b> a neutralization pond with commercial neutralizing powder, and a 3 rd <b>settling</b> <b>pond.</b> After two months of operation, the pH value of the final effluent did not increase, and the concentrations of some metals in the discharge remained high. In order to improve the passive {{treatment system}}, water analysis and tracer test were performed on site, and some batch tests {{for the evaluation of}} used substrates were also carried out. The main reasons why the system failed to remove some metals and acidity were: insufficient retention time and unsuitable material in SAPS. A new system was proposed to enhance the removal of metal and the acidity of the original system by enlarging the SAPS and by supplementary installation of a new aerobic wetland. To enlarge the size of SAPS, the 1 st <b>settling</b> <b>pond</b> and the original SAPS were proposed to be changed to a 1 st SAPS. The 2 nd and 3 rd <b>settling</b> <b>ponds</b> and the neutralizing pond were proposed to be changed to a 2 nd SAPS, and the last pond transformed into an aerobic wetland...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of tubificid worms on nutrient translocation from water to fish farm sediments accumulating in <b>settling</b> <b>ponds</b> was addressed under laboratory conditions. Small microcosms of 0. 5 L were {{filled up with}} 35 g of sludge from a fish farm <b>settling</b> <b>pond</b> and 0. 15 L of filtered <b>settling</b> <b>pond</b> water. The experimental set up consisted of one control line (no worms added), a second experimental line with 1 mg of tubificid worms·g- 1 fresh sediment (550 individuals·m- 2) and a third experimental line with 40 mg of tubificid worms·g- 1 fresh sediment (22 [*] 000 individuals·m- 2). Nutrients translocation was determined by monitoring overlaying water concentration of ammonia, nitrate and phosphate for ten days. Results showed that abundances of 550 individuals·m- 2 had no significant influence on the fluxes of nutrients here considered. However, the {{influence of}} higher abundances of tubificids (22 [*] 000 individuals·m- 2) was of significant extent on the translocation of nitrate and phosphate.
