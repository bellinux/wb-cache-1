5|$|Adult dusky sharks have a {{broad and}} varied diet, {{consisting}} mostly of bony fishes, sharks and rays, and cephalopods, but also occasionally crustaceans, sea stars, bryozoans, sea turtles, marine mammals, carrion, and garbage. This species is viviparous with a three-year reproductive cycle; females bear litters of 314 young after a gestation period of 2224 months, after which there is <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> rest before they become pregnant again. Females are capable of storing sperm for long periods, as their encounters with suitable mates may be {{few and far between}} due to their nomadic lifestyle and low overall abundance. Dusky sharks are one of the slowest-growing and latest-maturing sharks, not reaching adulthood until around 20 years of age.|$|E

In 1872, Wallace built the Dell, a house of concrete, on land he leased in Grays in Essex, where he lived until 1876.
