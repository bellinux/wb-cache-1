Similarly a Copenhagen '96 scheme was pained for Copenhagen's term as the European Capital of Culture. Since 2002, SAS has painted selected aircraft in a Star Alliance livery.

Scattered-extended objects have a Tisserand parameter (relative to Neptune) greater than 3 and have a time-averaged eccentricity greater than 0.2.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>scheme</b> to {{circumvent}} the settler grants altogether soon emerged. A railroad official hired a surveyor and logger named Stephen A.

In 1904, an investigation by The Oregonian uncovered the scandal, by which time it had grown to such a magnitude that the paper reported that more than 75% of the land sales had violated federal law.|$|E
