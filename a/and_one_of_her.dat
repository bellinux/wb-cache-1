5|$|Around 1671, Anne {{first made}} the {{acquaintance}} of Sarah Jennings, {{who later became}} her close friend <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> most influential advisors. Jennings married John Churchill (the future Duke of Marlborough) in about 1678. His sister, Arabella Churchill, was the Duke of York's mistress, and {{he was to be}} Anne's most important general.|$|E

5|$|The writer Frances Trollope, {{mother of}} novelist Anthony Trollope, rented {{a house on}} Hadley Common from January 1836 until the early summer of 1838, {{possibly}} Gladsmuir, shortly {{after the death of}} her husband <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> sons. According to Robert Bradford's biography of Martin Amis, Jane Howard discovered the Trollope connection from the house's papers and maintained that Frances Trollope had purchased it, although a purchase seems unlikely given the Trollope family's finances.|$|E
5|$|In Mendota, Minnesota, John Doggett (Robert Patrick) {{arrives at}} an {{abandoned}} apartment building {{after getting a}} tip, and sees a figure bolt {{out of one of}} the rooms during the night. He hears a scratching sound and claws away at the fresh plaster wall until blood begins streaming downward. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) performs an autopsy on the body Doggett found <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> FBI cadets, Rudolph Hayes, accurately guesses that the victim hooked up with a psychotic killer at a bar. Hayes's suggestions lead Scully to connect this murder to another killing two weeks earlier. In the meantime, Doggett wonders why anyone tipped him off about the murder, since it is not an X-File.|$|E
5|$|Kemper was {{released}} {{at the age}} of 21 after convincing Atascadero psychiatrists that he had been rehabilitated. Kemper was regarded as nonthreatening by his victims. He solely targeted young female hitchhikers during his killing spree, luring them into his vehicle and driving them to quiet areas where he would murder them before taking their corpses back to his home to be decapitated, dismembered, and violated. He then murdered his mother <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> friends before turning himself in to the authorities. He was found sane to stand trial and in 1973 guilty and requested the death penalty for his crimes. However, capital punishment was temporarily suspended in California. He instead received eight life sentences. Since then, Kemper has been incarcerated in the California Medical Facility.|$|E

5|$|The {{voice of}} Captain Ochre was {{provided}} by English-born Canadian, Jeremy Wilkin. Having served {{in the role of}} Virgil Tracy during the second series of Thunderbirds, Wilkin remained to voice Ochre for the subsequent production. The character of Captain Magenta, meanwhile, was voiced by Gary Files. Another Australian actor, Files was a fresh addition to Century 21 Productions, and was cast for a number of roles in the second Thunderbirds film, Thunderbird 6, before progressing to the role of Magenta for Captain Scarlet. Like Files, Welsh actress Liz Morgan was new to the Anderson productions and voiced the regular characters of Destiny Angel, the lead pilot of the Spectrum Angel fighter squadron, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> subordinates, Rhapsody Angel.|$|E
5|$|Though Olga {{repeatedly}} asked Tsar Nicholas II {{to allow}} her to divorce, her brother refused on religious and dynastic grounds; he believed marriage was for life and that royalty should marry within royalty. When their brother, Grand Duke Michael, eloped with his mistress, Natasha Wulfert, the Tsar and Olga were scandalized {{along with the rest of}} society. Natasha was a commoner who had been divorced twice, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> former husbands was an officer in the same regiment as Kulikovsky. Michael was banished from Russia, and the likelihood of the Tsar ever granting Olga's divorce, or permitting her to marry a commoner, looked remote.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt was {{a member}} of the {{prominent}} American Roosevelt and Livingston families and a niece of President Theodore Roosevelt. She had an unhappy childhood, having suffered the deaths of both parents <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> brothers at a young age. At 15, she attended Allenwood Academy in London and was deeply influenced by its feminist headmistress Marie Souvestre. Returning to the U.S., she married her fifth cousin once removed, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in 1905. The Roosevelts' marriage was complicated from the beginning by Franklin's controlling mother, Sara, and after Eleanor discovered her husband's affair with Lucy Mercer in 1918, she resolved to seek fulfillment in a public life of her own. She persuaded Franklin to stay in politics after he was stricken with debilitating polio in 1921, which cost him the normal use of his legs, and Roosevelt began giving speeches and appearing at campaign events in his place. Following Franklin's election as Governor of New York in 1928, and throughout the remainder of Franklin's public career in government, Roosevelt regularly made public appearances on his behalf, and as First Lady while her husband served as President, she significantly reshaped and redefined the role of that office during her own tenure and beyond, for future First Ladies.|$|E

5|$|To {{avoid having}} to scrap Hiei {{under the terms of}} the Washington Treaty, the Imperial Japanese Navy decided to convert her into a demilitarized {{training}} ship. On 15 October 1929, she went into drydock at Kure Naval Arsenal. Her aft 14-inch gun turrets were removed, and she was stripped of all eight of her submerged torpedo tubes, as well as her 6-inch guns and armor belt. All but nine of her boilers were taken out, reducing her speed to , <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> three funnels was removed. She was reclassified as a reserve ship at the end of November 1929. On 24 April 1930, reconstruction was halted due to the signing of the London Naval Treaty, which further restricted battleship construction and possession amongst the great naval powers, and preservation work was begun at Sasebo. Reconstruction would not resume until July 1931.|$|E
