5|$|Círdan (Shipwright) is the epessë of a Telerin Elf who {{remained}} in Beleriand, and later Lindon, {{until the end of}} the Third Age. His original name was only rarely remembered in traditions as Nōwē, and he was referred to <b>always</b> <b>as</b> Círdan, a title which had been given to him as Lord of the Falas.|$|E
5|$|Camp's new {{scrimmage}} rules {{revolutionized the}} game, though not <b>always</b> <b>as</b> intended. Princeton, in particular, used scrimmage play {{to slow the}} game, making incremental progress towards the end zone during each down. Rather than increase scoring, which had been Camp's original intent, the rule was exploited to maintain control of the ball for the entire game, resulting in slow, unexciting contests. At the 1882 rules meeting, Camp proposed that a team be required to advance the ball a minimum of five yards within three downs. These down-and-distance rules, combined {{with the establishment of}} the line of scrimmage, transformed the game from a variation of rugby football into the distinct sport of American football.|$|E
5|$|Galveston's {{attitudes toward}} race were at times {{unique in the}} region. The strict segregationalist attitudes {{prevalent}} {{in many parts of}} the U.S. were not <b>always</b> <b>as</b> stark in Galveston's society as in some other parts of Texas. One of the most striking examples of this was the gradual establishment of biracial labor unions of waterfront workers beginning in the 19th century, although eventually this alliance fell victim to segregationist influence. Racist ideology was always an ever-present factor in the city, however, as evinced by the name of the group which ran the Mardi Gras, the Kotton Karnival Kids (KKK, the same initials as the Ku Klux Klan).|$|E

5|$|Compared {{to other}} hyenas, the spotted hyena shows a greater {{relative}} amount of frontal cortex which {{is involved in}} the mediation of social behavior. Studies strongly suggest convergent evolution in spotted hyena and primate intelligence. A study done by evolutionary anthropologists demonstrated that spotted hyenas outperform chimpanzees on cooperative problem-solving tests; captive pairs of spotted hyenas were challenged to tug two ropes in unison to earn a food reward, successfully cooperating and learning the maneuvers quickly without prior training. Experienced hyenas even helped inexperienced clan-mates to solve the problem. In contrast, chimps and other primates often require extensive training, and cooperation between individuals is not <b>always</b> <b>as</b> easy for them. The intelligence of the spotted hyena was attested to by Dutch colonists in 19th-century South Africa, who noted that hyenas were exceedingly cunning and suspicious, particularly after successfully escaping from traps. Spotted hyenas seem to plan on hunting specific species in advance; hyenas have been observed to indulge in activities such as scent marking before setting off to hunt zebras, a behaviour which does not occur when they target other prey species. Also, spotted hyenas have been recorded to utilise deceptive behaviour, including giving alarm calls during feeding when no enemies are present, thus frightening off other hyenas and allowing them to temporarily eat in peace. Similarly, mothers will emit alarm calls in attempting to interrupt attacks on their cubs by other hyenas.|$|E
5|$|Following the season, Chamakh turned {{professional}} {{and signed a}} three-year contract with Bordeaux. He spent {{the first half of}} the 2002–03 campaign playing in the fourth division, but following the winter break, was called up to the senior team by manager Elie Baup. Chamakh made his professional debut on 19 January 2003 in the team's Coupe de la Ligue match against Metz. He appeared as a substitute and played 15 minutes in a 1–0 defeat. Chamakh made his league debut three weeks later in a 2–0 home defeat to Bastia again appearing as a substitute. On 20 May, he scored his first professional goal against Nice, netting the equalizing goal just a minute before injury time in a 1–1 draw. Chamakh appeared in 14 games, <b>always</b> <b>as</b> a substitute, during the campaign. In the 2003–04 season, he was promoted to the senior team permanently by new manager Michel Pavon and made his first professional league start on 1 November 2003 in a 1–0 win over Marseille. In the team's following match, Chamakh scored the opening goal in a 1–1 draw with Strasbourg just before halftime. However, midway through the second half, he received his first career red card after incurring a second yellow. Upon returning from his one-game suspension, Chamakh developed into a regular starter for the club, scoring goals in consecutive matches against Metz and Montpellier. He finished the league campaign with six goals in 25 matches. In the club's UEFA Cup campaign, Chamakh netted four times in eight appearances.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, pro-angiogenic protein therapy uses well-defined, {{precisely}} structured proteins, with previously defined optimal {{doses of}} the individual protein for disease states, and with well-known biological effects. On the other hand, an obstacle of protein therapy is the mode of delivery. Oral, intravenous, intra-arterial, or intramuscular routes of protein administration are not <b>always</b> <b>as</b> effective, as the therapeutic protein may be metabolized or cleared before it can enter the target tissue. Cell-based pro-angiogenic therapies are still early stages of research, with many open questions regarding best cell types and dosages to use.|$|E
25|$|Pitch {{control is}} {{achieved}} by tilting the rotor fore and aft; roll control by tilting the rotor laterally (side to side). Three designs to affect the tilt of the rotor are a tilting hub (Cierva), swashplate (Air & Space 18A), or servo-flaps. A rudder provides yaw control. On pusher configuration autogyros, the rudder is typically placed in the propeller slipstream to maximize yaw control at low airspeed (but not <b>always,</b> <b>as</b> seen in the McCulloch J-2, with twin rudders placed outboard of the propeller arc).|$|E

25|$|Wells's {{earliest}} specialised {{training was}} in biology, and his thinking on ethical matters {{took place in}} a specifically and fundamentally Darwinian context. He was also from an early date an outspoken socialist, often (but not <b>always,</b> <b>as</b> {{at the beginning of the}} First World War) sympathising with pacifist views. His later works became increasingly political and didactic, and he wrote little science fiction, while he sometimes indicated on official documents that his profession was that of journalist. Novels like Kipps and The History of Mr Polly, which describe lower-middle-class life, led to the suggestion that he was a worthy successor to Charles Dickens, but Wells described a range of social strata and even attempted, in Tono-Bungay (1909), a diagnosis of English society as a whole. A diabetic, in 1934, Wells co-founded the charity The Diabetic Association (known today as Diabetes UK).|$|E
25|$|In other assemblies, however, an {{individual}} (after baptism) must show {{a commitment to}} a particular assembly by faithful attendance to as many assembly meetings as possible.

Once it is shown that the individual desires acceptance into assembly fellowship, that desire is then communicated to the gathered assembly so that all members may have opportunity to express any concerns regarding the applicant.

25|$|Jamaica was not <b>always</b> <b>as</b> {{diverse as}} it is today. Throughout the 19th to early 20th centuries, Jamaica was mainly {{populated}} with whites as new Irish immigrants settled around the places known today as Downtown and Baisley Pond Park. In the 1950s, however, what was later called white flight began and middle-income African Americans started taking their place. After the 1970s, as housing prices began to tumble, many Hispanic such as Salvadorans, Colombians, Dominicans, and West Indian immigrants moved in. These ethnic groups tended to stay more towards the Jamaica Avenue and South Jamaica areas. Immigration from other countries did not become widespread until the late 1990s and early 2000s. Gentrification and decrease in crime attracted many families to Jamaica's safe havens; Hillside Avenue reflects this trend. Along 150th to 161st streets, much of the stores and restaurants typify South American and Caribbean cultures.|$|E
