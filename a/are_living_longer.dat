25|$|The key {{assumption}} underpinning Black's {{thinking is}} that because people <b>are</b> <b>living</b> <b>longer</b> {{they will have to}} work longer - hence the need for more effective intervention when working people fall ill, so that they can remain in the workforce instead of retiring on medical grounds or going onto benefits.|$|E
25|$|Americans <b>are</b> <b>living</b> <b>longer</b> {{and more}} healthily than ever before, {{according}} {{to one of the most}} comprehensive studies of its kind. There was a 3.8 year increase in average life expectancy during the previous two decades, with quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) also increasing. However, there was a notable rise in anxiety among young and middle-aged people beginning in 2001.|$|E
25|$|People <b>are</b> <b>living</b> <b>longer</b> and {{developing}} different needs, particularly {{those related to}} non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and chronic conditions that require lifelong care, such as diabetes, hypertension, and cancer.

5000|$|Some of the book's key points, such as {{the claim}} that {{technological}} innovation is {{a major component of}} economic growth, are more widely accepted now than in 1982.

50|$|With {{the advent}} of life-prolonging {{antiretroviral}} drug therapies, people with HIV <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>longer.</b> Pervasive fear of infection remained, but people now needed long-term care and services. Fear and discrimination caused some physicians, especially dentists, to refuse medical and dental treatment to people living with HIV. In response, in 1992 ASA founded the Jack Sansing Dental Clinic, which still provides quality, affordable dental care.|$|R
30|$|Despite {{significant}} {{advances in}} our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cardiovascular disease, diagnostic tests for judging its severity and response to therapeutic interventions remain invasive (angiography, intravascular ultrasound) or suffer from lack of precision.

25|$|Population ageing in Europe {{is caused}} {{primarily}} by two factors: declining fertility rates and increased life expectancy. Europe's fertility {{rates have been}} less than the 2.1 children per woman (standard) replacement level and are projected to remain below the replacement level in the future. People <b>are</b> <b>living</b> <b>longer</b> with projections of average life expectancy reaching 84.6 years for men and 89.1 for women by 2060, an increase of 7.9 years of life for men and 6.6 years of life for women compared to 2010.|$|E
25|$|Employment of {{registered}} nurses and nurse practitioners {{is expected to}} increase immensely in the next ten years through legislation and the idea of short-term savings. Much of the growth is expected to come as a result of legislation and proliferation of online schools, leading to the idea of better health care and a greater variety of solutions for health problems which have not been proven through appropriate research. Also, life expectancy is getting longer; therefore more patients <b>are</b> <b>living</b> <b>longer</b> and living more active lives. It is further anticipated that the need for NPs will increase because of the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).|$|E
25|$|The {{morbidity}} and mortality caused by HCV has increased {{since the inception of}} highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) because HIV patients <b>are</b> <b>living</b> <b>longer</b> from potent antiretroviral therapies and prophylaxis of traditional opportunistic infections. The effect of HCV on the natural history of HIV remains inconclusive due to contradictory studies documenting no effect, while others show an increase to an AIDS defining illness or death. In the United States, approximately 150,000 to 300,000 people are co-infected with HIV and HCV. This represents 15% to 30% of all HIV infected patients and 5% to 10% of all HCV patients. Reduced HCV antibody production, drug interactions, other causes of liver disease, differing epidemiologic characteristics and natural history complicate the management of HCV/HIV patients. Until recently there was little data published regarding treating HIV–HCV co-infected patients; fortunately recent trials have been published about the safety and efficacy of current treatment options.|$|E
50|$|The futures {{of health}} and welfare systems in Japan are being shaped by the rapid aging of the population. Medical insurance, {{health care for the}} elderly, and public health {{expenses}} constituted about 60% of social welfare and social security costs in 1975, while government pensions accounted for 20%. By the early 1980s, pensions accounted for nearly 50% of social welfare and social security expenditures because people <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>longer</b> after retirement. A fourfold increase in workers' individual contributions was projected by the twenty-first century.|$|R
25|$|Females tend to live {{five years}} longer; i.e. their funds need to {{last five years}} longer than men's funds. In addition, women face gender {{specific}} challenges resulting from how they are socialized. For example, they must follow rules of negotiating for a higher salary from a mutually-beneficial framework to avoid suffering from a negative employer backlash. As {{a result of all}} of the above-mentioned inequities, women face a more complex money management situation than men in which they earn less but will <b>be</b> <b>living</b> <b>longer</b> and incurring higher expenses.|$|R

[...] The longer term outlook is also pessimistic, based on an estimate by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, revealed by Cai Fang, deputy director.

2500|$|In June 2010, Duncan Smith {{said that}} the Government would {{encourage}} people to work for longer by making it illegal for companies to force staff to give up work at 65, and by bringing forward the planned rises in the age for claiming the state pension. Duncan Smith told The Daily Telegraph that pension reforms were intended to [...] "reinvigorate retirement". [...] "People <b>are</b> <b>living</b> <b>longer</b> and healthier lives than ever, {{and the last thing}} we want is to lose their skills and experience from the workplace due to an arbitrary age limit," [...] he said. [...] "Now is absolutely the right time to live up to our responsibility to reform our outdated pension system and to take action where the previous government failed to do so. If Britain is to have a stable, affordable pension system, people need to work longer, but we will reward their hard work with a decent state pension that will enable them to enjoy quality of life in their retirement." ...|$|E

30|$|Considering the modal age at death, we can {{say that}} for men during the period 1973 to 1989, the {{interval}} was [75, 80] years, and between 1990 and 2005, the modal age at death increased to the interval [80, 85] years. For women, the modal age at death was in the interval [75, 80] years for the period 1973 to 1983, while in the period 1984 to 2005, the modal age of death increased to the interval [80, 85] years.

Improvements in screening, earlier intervention and more effective treatments mean that cancer survival rates are increasing, particularly for common cancers. In a comparative study of breast cancer survival across 30 European countries, only Iceland saw an overall decline in mortality between 1989 and 2006 (45 %) greater than in England and Wales (35 %) (Autier et al, 2010).

Technological advancement also means that health care professionals are able to use better technologies to treat patients for example in surgery.

The concept of aging well, which is based on a nonmedical approach to promoting health and well-being, is fundamental to increasing length and quality of life. Aging well promotes personal behaviors and life-course environments that limit functional declines, especially those caused by chronic conditions, to help older adults maintain their independence and health.
