The Gendarmerie and the Coast Guard operate as parts of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in peacetime, although they are subordinated to the Army and Navy Commands respectively in wartime, during which they have both internal law enforcement and military functions. The Chief of the General Staff is appointed by the President and is responsible to the Prime Minister. The Council of Ministers is responsible to the Parliament for matters of national security and the adequate preparation of the <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> defend the country. However, the authority to declare war and to deploy the Turkish <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> <b>to</b> foreign countries or to allow foreign <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> be stationed in Turkey rests solely with the Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Chromium oxides {{are also}} used as a green color in glassmaking and as a glaze in ceramics. Green {{chromium}} oxide is extremely light-fast and as such is used in cladding coatings.

5|$|Countershading, like counter-illumination, {{has rarely}} been applied in {{practice}} for military camouflage, though not because military authorities were unaware of it. Both Abbott Thayer in the First World War and Hugh Cott in the Second World War proposed countershading to their countries' armed forces. They each demonstrated the effectiveness of countershading, without succeeding in persuading their <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> adopt the technique, though they influenced military adoption of camouflage in general.|$|E

5|$|Eventually a rift {{developed}} between Amin and Obote, {{exacerbated by the}} support Amin had built within the army by recruiting from the West Nile region, his involvement in operations to support the rebellion in southern Sudan and an attempt on Obote's life in 1969.

Jean Schramme was appointed to be commander of an army in exile, while Jeremiah Puren was ordered to evacuate {{what remained of the}} Katangese Air Force, along with necessary military equipment and the Katangese treasury. This was accomplished via air and railway. Rhodesian operatives assisted in smuggling the gold reserves out of the country. The last of Schramme's mercenaries and gendarmes were evacuated on 25 January. Other gendarmes spent the remainder of 1963 in Northern Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|The Vajpayee {{government}} {{ordered the}} Indian <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> expel the Pakistani soldiers occupying Kashmir territory, later {{known as the}} Kargil War. Although the government was later criticised for the intelligence failures that did not detect Pakistani presence, it was successful in ousting them from the previously Indian-controlled territory. The Vajpayee administration also offered political support to the US War on Terror, {{in the hope of}} better addressing India's issues with terrorism and insurgency in Kashmir. This led to closer defence ties with the US, including negotiations for the sale of weapons.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to France Wick was {{promoted}} to Hauptmann and on 9 September was named Gruppenkommandeur (group commander) of I. Gruppe JG2. During September he continued adding to his score, and on 5 October gained his 41st combat victory {{on his way to}} overtake his two closest rivals, Major Adolf Galland and Oberstleutnant Mölders. The 41st victory earned him his second reference in the Wehrmachtbericht on 6 October 1940. He also became the fourth member of the <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> receive the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves directly from Hitler at Berghof in Bavaria on 8 September 1940.|$|E

5|$|Australia's {{role in the}} Pacific War {{declined}} from 1944. The increasing size of the US forces in the Pacific rendered the Australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the Government {{to reduce the size}} of the <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> boost war production. Nevertheless, the Government wanted the Australian military to remain active, and agreed to MacArthur's proposals that it be used in relatively unimportant campaigns. In late 1944, Australian troops and RAAF squadrons replaced US garrisons in eastern New Guinea, New Britain, and Bougainville, and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining Japanese forces there. In May 1945, I Corps, the Australian First Tactical Air Force and USAAF and USN units began the Borneo Campaign, which continued until the end of the war. These campaigns contributed little to Japan's defeat and remain controversial.|$|E
5|$|Flight 706 had {{departed}} Los Angeles just after 6pm, on route to Seattle, with scheduled stopovers in Salt Lake City, Utah; Boise, Idaho; Lewiston, Idaho; Pasco, Washington and Yakima, Washington. The F-4 Phantom was arriving at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro near Irvine from Naval Air Station Fallon in Nevada. The F-4 pilot and all 49 {{passengers and crew}} aboard the civilian airliner died in the collision over the San Gabriel Mountains, near Duarte. Only the Radar Intercept Officer of the F-4 survived. The crash of RW 706 prompted the US <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> <b>to</b> agree to both {{reduce the number of}} military aircraft operating under visual flight rules in civilian air corridors, and to require military aircraft to contact civilian air traffic controllers.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 American {{intelligence}} analyst Raelynn Hillhouse {{wrote that}} according to U.S. intelligence sources, the U.S. had been tipped-off to bin Laden's location by an unnamed Pakistani intelligence insider collecting the $25 million reward. According to the sources, Pakistan purposely stood-down its <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> allow the U.S. raid, and the original plan was to kill – not capture – bin Laden. Hillhouse's sources stated that the Pakistanis had been keeping bin Laden under house arrest near their military headquarters in Abbottabad with money provided by the Saudis. According to The Telegraph, Hillhouse's account might explain why U.S. forces encountered no resistance {{on their way to}} and in Abbottabad, and why some residents in Abbottabad were warned to stay in their houses the day before the raid.|$|E

The presentation was made on 27 August 1941 by Hitler at the Führer Headquarter Wolfsschanze (Wolf's Lair) in Rastenburg (now Kętrzyn in Poland). Following the loss of Hauptmann Franz Eckerle, who had been reported as missing in action since 14 February 1942, Philipp, who had claimed his 77th victory, was appointed Gruppenkommandeur of I./JG54 on 22 March 1942. On 23 February, Philipp shot down his 82nd opponent, the 158 IAP's (158th Fighter Aviation Regiment) Leytenant Mikhail Satalkin, who was posted as missing in action.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} to Arlene caused torrential and prolonged rainfall across Central America. In El Salvador, a single landslide {{attributed to the}} flooding killed 20people. Flooding in Mexico associated with the tropical system killed four {{in the state of}} Yucatán and one in Campeche, where flood damage was estimated at US$33million. As many as 4,000homes were flooded, impacting roughly 10,000people and prompting Mexican <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> implement emergency rescue plans in the state. The highest rainfall total in Mexico was documented in Mérida, Yucatán, where a station measured 13.26in (336mm) of rain. As a tropical cyclone, however, Arlene's highest rainfall total occurred in the Camargo Municipality of Tamaulipas, where 7.32in (186mm) of rain was reported. In Matamoros, roads were blocked by mud and rocks.|$|E
5|$|Until the Song dynasty took {{advantage}} of a large rebellion within the Liao Kingdom in 1125, the Song had to conduct cordial relations with the Liao. Skilled ambassadors were sent on missions to court the Liao and maintain peace, such as the renowned horologist, engineer, and state minister Su Song. The Song also prepared for armed conflict, increasing the overall size of the <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> a million soldiers by 1022. By that time, however, the military was consuming three-quarters of the tax revenues gathered by the state, compared to a mere 2 or 3 percent of state income that would be consumed by just providing the Liao with tribute. Due to these circumstances, intense political rivalries would later arise in the Song court over how to handle these issues.|$|E
