40|$|We {{study the}} {{supplier}} <b>relationship</b> choice for <b>a</b> buyer that invests in transferable capacity {{operated by a}} supplier. With <b>a</b> long-term <b>relationship,</b> the buyer commits to source from a supplier {{over a long period}} of time. With <b>a</b> short-term <b>relationship,</b> the buyer leaves open the option of switching to a new supplier in the future. The buyer has incomplete information about a supplier’s efficiency, and thus uses auctions to select suppliers and determine the contracts. In addition, the buyer faces uncertain demand for the product. <b>A</b> long-term <b>relationship</b> may be beneficial for the buyer because it motivates more aggressive bidding at the beginning, resulting a lower initial price. <b>A</b> short-term <b>relationship</b> may be advantageous because it allows switching, with the capacity transferred at some costs, to a more efficient supplier in the future. We find that there exists a critical level of switching costs above which <b>a</b> long-term <b>relationship</b> is better for the buyer than <b>a</b> short-term <b>relationship.</b> In addition, this critical switching cost decreases with demand uncertainty, implying <b>a</b> long-term <b>relationship</b> more favorable for a buyer facing volatile demand. Finally, we find that in <b>a</b> long-term <b>relationship,</b> capacity can be either higher or lower than in <b>a</b> short-term <b>relationship.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Background: This article {{presents}} cohort studies that use {{data from the}} National Health Information Survey from 1986 to 1994 and compares the effectiveness of Cox proportional hazards models that assume <b>a</b> linear <b>relationship</b> between body mass index (BMI) {{and the risk of}} prostate cancer with models that assume <b>a</b> J-shaped <b>relationship.</b> Methods and results: Our study found that for black males over 40 years of age, neither a linear nor <b>a</b> J-shaped <b>relationship</b> yielded <b>a</b> statistically significant model. With white males over 40 years, assuming <b>a</b> linear <b>relationship</b> did not yield a statistically significant model (P = 0. 582). When we assume <b>a</b> J-shaped <b>relationship,</b> the optimal change point where the risk of prostate cancer death is minimized occurs when the BMI is 25. 5. Among white males over 40 years with BMI 3 ̆c 25. 5, <b>an</b> inverse <b>relationship</b> was found (P = 0. 009). Among white males over 40 years with BMI 3 ̆e 25. 5, <b>a</b> direct <b>relationship</b> was found (P = 0. 017). Conclusion: With this data set, we found that for white males over 40 years, Cox proportional hazards models that assume <b>a</b> J-shaped <b>relationship</b> between BMI and prostate cancer death provide a much better fit than models assuming <b>a</b> linear <b>relationship...</b>|$|R
