40|$|The {{choice of}} {{admissible}} trading strategies in mathematical modeling of financial markets {{is a delicate}} issue, going back to Harrison and Kreps. In the context of optimal portfolio selection with expected utility preferences this question {{has been the focus}} of considerable attention over the last 20 years. We propose a novel notion of admissibility that has many pleasant features—admissibility is characterized purely under the objective measure P; each <b>admissible</b> <b>strategy</b> can be approximated by simple strategies using a finite number of trading dates; the wealth of any <b>admissible</b> <b>strategy</b> is a supermartingale under all pricing measures; local boundedness of the price process is not required; neither strict monotonicity, strict concavity, nor differentiability of the utility function is necessary; the definition encompasses both the classical mean-variance preferences and the monotone expected utility. For utility functions finite on R, our class represents a minimal set containing simple strategies which also contains the optimizer, under conditions that are milder than the celebrated reasonable asymptotic elasticity condition on the utility function...|$|E

The model considers the interests of consumers, who wish to minimize the cost of production while simultaneously ensuring the final product is of high quality. The cost parameters for production, the acceptance test, and <b>admissible</b> <b>strategy</b> are applied in the model. The cost components are formulated along with the minimization of the expected cost, and we used the repairable systems to guarantee the maintenance and sustainability of the economic system.

40|$|In {{this article}} we are {{interested}} in option pricing in markets with bubbles. A bubble is defined to be a price process which, when discounted, is a local martingale under the risk-neutral measure but not a martingale. We do not require the underlying process to be continuous, so that Levy-based asset prices are also possible. We give examples of bubbles both where volatility increases with the price level, and where the bubble {{is the result of a}} feedback mechanism. In a market with a bubble many standard results from the folklore become false. Put-call parity fails, the price of an American call exceeds that of a European call and prices are no longer convex in the underlying. We show how these results must be modified in the presence of a bubble. It turns out that the option value depends critically on the definition of <b>admissible</b> <b>strategy,</b> and that the standard mathematical definition may not be consistent with the definitions used for trading. 10. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{develop an}} {{approach}} to providing epistemic conditions for admissible behavior in games. Instead of using lexicographic beliefs to capture infinitely less likely conjectures, we postulate that players use tie-breaking sets to help decide among strategies that are outcome-equivalent given their conjectures. A player is event-rational if she best responds to a conjecture and uses a list of subsets of the other players' strategies to break ties among outcome-equivalent strategies. Using type spaces to capture interactive beliefs, we show that common belief of event-rationality (RCBER) implies that players play strategies in S 1 W, that is, <b>admissible</b> <b>strategies</b> that also survive iterated elimination of dominated strategies (Dekel and Fudenberg (1990)). We strengthen standard belief to validated belief and we show that event-rationality and common validated belief of event-rationality (RCvBER) implies that players play iterated <b>admissible</b> <b>strategies</b> (IA). We show that in complete, continuous and compact type structures, RCBER and RCvBER are nonempty, and hence we obtain epistemic criteria for SinfW and IA. ...|$|R

3000|$|Building on (Kraft and Steffensen 2005), we use {{the dynamic}} {{programming}} principle to characterize the HJB equations corresponding to the different default states. When the investor defaults, {{the solution to the}} HJB equation is specified as a boundary condition. Due to borrowing costs incurred by the investor when financing her purchases, the wealth process admits a concave drift, which is not differentiable with respect to the investment strategy. This prohibits the use of first-order conditions for analyzing the optimal strategy. Moreover, because of defaults and contagion effects, {{we have to deal with}} the presence of jumps both in the price and in the wealth dynamics, and with concave drift appearing only in the wealth but not in the price dynamics. This leads us to apply a different method which considers the concave drift as a continuous function of the <b>admissible</b> <b>strategy</b> ψ, differentiable everywhere except at a critical point ℓ. Such a critical point defines two regions where the optimal admissible control may lie.

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} the formulation of the decision-making tasks via specification including such specifying constituents as system, experience, ignorance, <b>admissible</b> <b>strategy,</b> loss function and decision [1]. The paper shows how to construct the offered specifi-cation on two examples of decision-making problems. One {{of them is a}} simple example from the everyday life; as the second example the fully probabilistic control design in its state-space setting has been taken [2]. The fully probabilistic design describes the controlled closed loop system and its desired behavior in probabilistic terms and uses the Kullback-Leibler divergence as their proximity measure [3]. Because of the state-space setting both solutions of filtering and regulation tasks are required. The example is demonstrated on normal state-space model and normal ideal pdf. In this case the solution of the fully probabilistic design reduces to Kalman filtering and design minimizing the quadratic criterion. The paper shows how this way of the material organizing can be applied as the educational re-sources of the e-learning software. Such an area of e-learning software content as math-oriented material (particularly, Bayesian decision making) are still not sufficiently supported nowadays.

40|$|Purpose - The paper {{presents}} a RCM embedded integer linear programming approach (suited {{to the budget}} monetary resources allocation task) to the maintenance strategies mix selection for an industrial plant equipments. Design/methodology/approach - The developed approach allows to determine the optimal maintenance strategies mix {{for a set of}} equipments in a more quantitative way than the classic RCM approach. The proposed model takes into account, for each potential failure determined using the FMECA and for each <b>admissible</b> <b>strategy,</b> the costs and the potential RPN reduction. Finally, an industrial case concerning an Italian paper-mill plant is reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach presented. Findings - The paper finds that the application of the proposed approach allows to optimally allocate the budget monetary resources, determining which suitable maintenance practice apply to each failure, taking into account the costs of each strategy and the potential reduction of the RPN. Practical implications - The proposed model permits to assign (during the budget monetary resources allocation task) to each failure the optimal strategy, among a set of suitable maintenance practices, considering the costs and the estimated RPN reduction. Originality/value - The paper proposes a completely new RCM embedded approach to the maintenance strategies selection, in order to optimally allocate the budget monetary resources. This model overcomes the limits of the traditional RCM approach, taking into account quantitative aspects, i. e. the compatibility constraint between failures and policies, the maintenance strategies costs, and the RPN estimated reduction...|$|E
40|$|When a large oil or gas {{field is}} produced, several {{reservoirs}} often {{share the same}} processing facility. This facility is typically capable of processing only {{a limited amount of}} commodities per unit of time. In order to satisfy these processing limitations, the production needs to be choked, i. e., scaled down by a suitable choke factor. A production strategy is defined as a vector valued function defined for all points of time representing the choke factors applied to reservoirs at any given time. In the present paper we consider the problem of optimizing such production strategies with respect to various types of objective functions. A general framework for handling this problem is developed. A crucial assumption in our approach is that the potential production rate from a reservoir can be expressed {{as a function of the}} remaining producible volume. The solution to the optimization problem depends on certain key properties, e. g., convexity or concavity, of the objective function and of the potential production rate functions. Using these properties several important special cases can be solved. An admissible production strategy is a strategy where the total processing capacity is fully utilized throughout a plateau phase. This phase lasts until the total potential production rate falls below the processing capacity, and after this all the reservoirs are produced without any choking. Under mild restrictions on the objective function the performance of an <b>admissible</b> <b>strategy</b> is uniquely characterized by the state of the reservoirs at the end of the plateau phase. Thus, finding an optimal admissible production strategy, is essentially equivalent to finding the optimal state at the end of the plateau phase. Given the optimal state a backtracking algorithm can then used to derive an optimal production strategy. We will demonstrate this on a specific example...|$|E
