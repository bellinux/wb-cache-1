Over the next few years, a number of Japanese-made games <b>appeared</b> <b>with</b> a similar format; major titles such as Cadash (1989) closely resemble The Adventure of Link, with side-scrolling platform stages supplemented by RPG-like statistical systems, weapons, armor, magic spells, and so forth.|$|E
5|$|Although The Covent-Garden Tragedy <b>appeared</b> <b>with</b> The Old Debauchees, {{it was not}} {{a success}} like the other play and quickly dropped.

A repeat the next day resulted in a classic dogfight with F-100 Super Sabres and F-105s fighting with more MiG-17s. In total, the USAF lost eleven aircraft to air and ground forces, while the VPAF lost three of their fighters.|$|E

30|$|In T 2 ‐weighted images, water <b>appears</b> <b>with</b> a high {{intensity}} of images. In T 2 images, lesions <b>appear</b> <b>with</b> higher (hyper‐) intensities {{when compared to}} the surrounding WM. Unfortunately, regions containing CSF also <b>appear</b> <b>with</b> high image intensities. As a result, it becomes difficult to segment lesions in areas near the CSF‐filled ventricles. Figure 1 shows an example of a normal brain and a brain with hyper‐intense lesions visible. In FLAIR images, a special weighting effectively removes the CSF from T 2 ‐weighted images. The result is an image where CSF <b>appears</b> <b>with</b> low intensity and lesions <b>appear</b> <b>with</b> a {{high intensity}}. FLAIR images can be useful for identifying lesions in WM, even in the periventricular region. Unfortunately, FLAIR imagery has a long acquisition time and may not be available for all patients. Proton‐density‐weighted images also show reduced intensity of CSF compared to T 2 ‐weighted, though not as much as FLAIR. The advantage of proton‐density‐weighted series is that they can be acquired together with T 2 images in the same sequence.|$|R
