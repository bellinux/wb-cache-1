Two years later, {{he came out of}} semi-retirement to sign with the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League (NASL) for the 1975 season. Though well past his prime at this point, Pelé was credited with significantly increasing public awareness and interest of the sport in the United States. Hoping to fuel the same kind of awareness in the Dominican Republic, he and the Cosmos team played in an exhibition match against Haitian team, Violette <b>AC,</b> <b>in</b> the Santo Domingo Olympic Stadium on 3 June 1976, where over 25,000 fans watched him score a winning goal in the last seconds of the match, leading the Cosmos to a 2–1 victory.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{collection}} of 250 anomalous Cepheids (<b>ACs)</b> discovered <b>in</b> the OGLE-IV fields toward the Large (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The LMC sample {{is an extension of}} the OGLE-III Catalog of <b>ACs</b> published <b>in</b> 2008, while the SMC sample contains the first known bona fide <b>ACs</b> <b>in</b> this galaxy. The total sample is composed of 141 <b>ACs</b> <b>in</b> the LMC and 109 <b>ACs</b> <b>in</b> the SMC. All these stars pulsate in single modes: fundamental (174 objects) or first overtone (76 objects). Additionally, we report the discovery of four <b>ACs</b> located <b>in</b> the foreground of the Magellanic Clouds. These are the first fundamental-mode <b>ACs</b> known <b>in</b> the Galactic field. We demonstrate that the coefficients phi_ 21 and phi_ 31 determined by the Fourier light curve decomposition are useful discriminators between classical Cepheids and <b>ACs,</b> at least <b>in</b> the LMC and in the field of the Milky Way. In the SMC, the light curve shapes and mean magnitudes of short-period classical Cepheids make them similar to ACs, which is a source of difficulties in the discrimination of both classes of pulsators. The presence of unidentified <b>ACs</b> <b>in</b> the catalogs of classical Cepheids may be partly responsible for the observed non-linearity of the period-luminosity relation observed for short-period Cepheids in the SMC. We compare spatial distributions of ACs, classical Cepheids and RR Lyr stars. We show that the distribution of ACs resembles that of old stars (RR Lyr variables), although in the LMC there are visible structures typical for young population (classical Cepheids) : the bar and spiral arms. This may suggest that ACs are a mixture of relatively young stars and mergers of very old stars. Comment: 18 pages, 9 figures, submitted to Acta Astronomic...|$|R

25|$|The {{interval}} <b>AC</b> <b>in</b> {{the diagram}} is 'space-like'; i.e., {{there is a}} frame of reference in which events A and C occur simultaneously, separated only in space. There are also frames in which A precedes C (as shown) and frames in which C precedes A.

Although this in itself won't give rise to a paradox, one can show that faster than light signals can be sent back into one's own past.

25|$|Glutathione reductase is a {{nicotinamide}} adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and FAD-dependent enzyme, and {{the major}} flavoprotein in erythrocyte. The measurement of the activity coefficient of erythrocyte glutathione reductase (EGR) is the preferred method for assessing riboflavin status. It provides a measure of tissue saturation and long-term riboflavin status. In vitro enzyme activity in terms of activity coefficients (AC) is determined both with and without the addition of FAD to the medium. ACs represent a ratio of the enzyme’s activity with FAD to the enzyme’s activity without FAD. An AC of 1.2 to 1.4, riboflavin status is considered low when FAD is added to stimulate enzyme activity. An AC > 1.4 suggests riboflavin deficiency. On the other hand, if FAD is added and AC is < 1.2, then riboflavin status is considered acceptable. Tillotson and Bashor reported that a decrease in the intakes of riboflavin was associated with increase in EGR <b>AC.</b> <b>In</b> the UK study of Norwich elderly, initial EGR AC values {{for both males and females}} were significantly correlated with those measured 2 years later, suggesting that EGR AC may be a reliable measure of long-term biochemical riboflavin status of individuals. These findings are consistent with earlier studies.|$|E
