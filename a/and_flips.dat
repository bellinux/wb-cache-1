5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between the champion, Sting, and the challenger, A.J. Styles. During the 15 minutes the match lasted, Styles {{executed}} his aerial technique the Spiral Tap, in which he jumps {{off one of the}} top padded turnbuckles, spins <b>and</b> <b>flips</b> in mid-air before landing on his opponent. He then ascended the turnbuckle to perform the maneuver once again, but was distracted by Angle and Booker T. Later, Styles missed a pele kick on Sting, which allowed Sting to counter with a small package pin on Styles to retain the championship.|$|E
5|$|As Michael {{travels to}} Haddonfield, Laurie begins having {{hallucinations}} that mirror Michael's and also begin to include her acting out his murders. Meanwhile, Loomis goes on tour {{to promote his}} new book, only to be criticized by the public, who blame him for Michael's actions and for exploiting the deaths of Michael's victims. When Loomis' book is released, Laurie discovers that she is really Angel Myers, Michael's long-lost sister. She goes to a party with Mya (Brea Grant) and Harley (Angela Trimbur) to escape how she is feeling. Michael appears and kills Harley, then goes to the Brackett house and fatally wounds Annie Brackett (Danielle Harris). When Laurie and Mya arrive, Michael kills Mya and then comes after Laurie, who manages to escape. Laurie flags down a car, but Michael kills the driver <b>and</b> <b>flips</b> the car over with Laurie still inside. Michael then takes the unconscious Laurie to an abandoned shed.|$|E
5|$|The {{video is}} shot in {{black-and-white}} and {{is set in}} a dimly lit and smoky office, where Beyoncé puts on a private show for a detective (played by actor Brett G. Smith). As the clip begins, the detective is gazing out the window. Beyoncé then arrives and stands in an open doorway while rain pours outside. With wavy hair and winged eyeliner, Beyoncé is dressed in a thigh-length leather trench coat and high stockings. After walking inside the office, she immediately strips off her coat. This reveals a satin dress over black panties and thigh-high pantyhose held up by garters. When the music starts, Beyoncé sits on a desk and plays with her hair, her back facing the face of the detective. The latter leans against his desk while watching Beyoncé, who starts to dance sensually on the desk <b>and</b> <b>flips</b> her hair to seduce him. As Beyoncé dances around the armchair, she exposes her vintage-style underwear.|$|E

25|$|In October 2016, David Platt {{attempted}} to get revenge {{on his wife}} Kylie's killer Clayton Hibbs by crashing his car into the prison van that killer Clayton was in. In a bid {{to protect him from}} himself, Gail and Nick lock him in the cellar of the Bistro. However he fakes his own death and manages to escape his makeshift prison cell.

However, while driving the car, he sees his daughter Lily in the road and swerves the car <b>and</b> <b>flips</b> over in it.

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Allen pulling up to a junkyard {{in a white}} pickup truck at night, with a watch hanging from his key chain. [...] Then, Allen takes a power cord {{out of the back}} of the truck and carries it through the junkyard until he plugs it in <b>and</b> <b>flips</b> a switch to turn on a large {{countdown}} clock. [...] As the clock reaches zero, Allen leaves and begins walking away from the camera as the sun rises. [...] Throughout the video, Allen is shown playing both an acoustic guitar and a piano, as well as singing without any instruments.|$|E

[...] The mosquito has a personality: egotistical, persistent, and calculating (as when it whets its proboscis on a stone wheel). [...] It makes eye contact with the viewers and waves at them. [...] McCay balances horror with humor, as when the mosquito finds itself so engorged with blood that it must lie down.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most obvious}} {{feature of the}} Acrobatic rock and roll dance are its kicks (into thin air) and its acrobatic {{elements}} like lifts, jumps, throws <b>and</b> <b>flips.</b> Today's rock and roll is focused on show and competition dance and - {{with the exception of}} its name - has nearly nothing in common with the former rock and roll movement. It is danced in pairs or in formation and can even be danced with one male and two females simultaneously which is called [...] "triples". Over the years rock and roll dancing has experienced several important changes: the former 6-basic step was converted into the modern tournament's 9-basic step with its typical kick ball change. Other characteristics are techniques such as the man's body wave movement, that he uses to fling his partner from a sitting position upwards, and the throwing basic movement, where she steps onto his hands and is catapulted upwards into neck breaking jumps. Because of its demanding technique, high speed, and acrobatics, Rock and Roll is a straining high-performance dance and is most often performed by young dancers.|$|E
2500|$|Cymbals are {{not played}} {{in the same manner}} as orchestral crash cymbals, as there is a change in the grip of the straps. The hand goes through the hoop and twists, causing the hand to be flat against the bell of the cymbal, {{although}} variations are sometimes used for effect. Each player carries two cymbals of identical size and crashes them together, in addition to producing other sound effects by striking or rubbing the cymbals together. Cymbal players often perform visuals– movements such as twirls <b>and</b> <b>flips</b> that are eye-pleasing and boost the general effect of the group. [...] There is generally a 1-to-1 or 1-to-2 ratio of cymbal players to snares, as snare drummers sometimes play on the cymbals at some point during the performance, much in the manner that hi-hat cymbals are used on a drum set. [...] The number of cymbal players can vary according to their use. Cymbal parts are often split {{in the same manner as}} bass drum parts– each cymbalist plays one component of a larger part. Some drum corps (or less often, marching bands) do not have marching cymbal players at all, instead choosing to march additional hornline or color guard members, or other percussion instruments. [...] In indoor percussion ensembles, the trend seems to be towards keeping or expanding cymbal sections.|$|E
2500|$|Summer and Ed join in {{with the}} {{argument}} {{and there is a}} lot of shouting. Lucas explained [...] "Summer's aware they've overloaded the car, so she wants to keep calm. She can sense Chris is getting stressed by all the yelling, so she's very tense." [...] As Chris tries to concentrate on the road, Andrew accidentally bumps his arm and he suddenly loses control of the car, which swerves, hits an embankment <b>and</b> <b>flips</b> over before coming to a stop. Sophie is critically injured after being thrown from the vehicle, while Andrew has a serious head injury and Ed is also in a bad way. Rhys Lawson (Ben Barber) comes across the scene and puts his own life at risk to start [...] "frantic" [...] rescue efforts. He cuts his hand in the process, but refuses to get it looked when the emergency services arrive. Rhys eventually finds Sophie and when she reaches the hospital, she is rushed into surgery. A writer for Soap World commented that [...] "a terrified" [...] Natasha is worried Ed will not wake up, before she can tell him she loves him. Mason stated that Chris is wracked with guilt and worried for his friends. Things become worse for him when Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) arrives at the hospital and, after learning his son and niece are in a serious condition, threatens to sue him. Mason revealed that Paul is angry and wants someone to pay for what happened, while Dennis explained [...] "Yes, it's typical Paul - someone has to pay and he decides that Chris should take all of the blame before he knows the full story." ...|$|E
