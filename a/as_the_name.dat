5|$|From 1970 onward, {{increasing}} numbers of books teaching readers how to become Pagan Witches were published; the earliest was Paul Huson's Mastering Witchcraft (1970), which made no reference to Wicca. This was followed by Raymond Buckland's The Tree: The Complete Book of Saxon Witchcraft, in which he propagated his newly developed tradition of Seax-Wica; utilising Wica <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of the tradition, he also referenced the Wicca <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of the religion as a whole. Contrastingly, during the 1970s the term Wicca was rejected by feminist Pagan Witchcraft groups in the United States, in particular the Dianic tradition; the term {{does not appear in}} the early works of Zsuzsanna Budapest and Starhawk, although the latter would adopt it by the 21st century.|$|E

There are four denominations in this series: $2, $5, $10 and $20; its designs make extensive use of the Guilloché technique, heavily relied upon by banknotes of many currencies during the 1980s.|$|E

It therefore seems that Macklin's story is an invention inspired by the green children of Woolpit, particularly {{as there is no}} record of any Spanish village called Banjos.|$|E
