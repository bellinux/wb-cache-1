5|$|Narayan {{highlights}} {{the social context}} and everyday life of his characters. He {{has been compared to}} William Faulkner who also created a similar fictional town and likewise explored with humour <b>and</b> <b>compassion</b> the energy of ordinary life. Narayan's short stories have been compared with those of Guy de Maupassant because of his ability to compress a narrative. However he has also been criticised for the simplicity of his prose.|$|E

The following day he gives Cratchit an increase in pay and becomes like another father to Tiny Tim. From then on Scrooge began to treat everyone with kindness, generosity <b>and</b> <b>compassion,</b> embodying the spirit of Christmas.|$|E

40|$|Couple {{distress}} {{is common}} and associated with {{mental and physical}} health difficulties. Adult attachment insecurity has been associated with couple distress, but the mechanisms of this association need further investigation. This study investigated whether self-compassion <b>and</b> partner <b>compassion</b> mediated this association. 342 individuals and 75 couples completed an online questionnaire assessing attachment anxiety and avoidance, self- <b>and</b> partner <b>compassion,</b> <b>and</b> relationship quality <b>and</b> satisfaction. Partner <b>compassion</b> mediated the association between attachment avoidance and relationship quality and satisfaction. Self-compassion did not emerge as a direct mediator, but mediated between attachment insecurity and relationship measures through partner <b>compassion.</b> Self-compassion <b>and</b> partner <b>compassion</b> might play a role in relationship functioning. Interventions aiming to enhance compassion might be helpful in reducing couple distress...|$|R

5|$|After Ueshiba left Hokkaidō in 1919, he met and {{was profoundly}} {{influenced}} by Onisaburo Deguchi, the {{spiritual leader of}} the Ōmoto-kyō religion (a neo-Shinto movement) in Ayabe. One of the primary features of Ōmoto-kyō is its emphasis on the attainment of utopia during one's life. This was a great influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love <b>and</b> <b>compassion</b> especially to {{those who seek to}} harm others. Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.|$|E
5|$|Anne, however, {{expected}} kindness <b>and</b> <b>compassion</b> {{from her}} closest friend. Sarah was not forthcoming {{in this regard}} and frequently overpowered and dominated Anne. One major political disagreement occurred when Sarah insisted that her son-in-law, Charles Spencer, the third Earl of Sunderland, be admitted into the Privy Council. Sarah allied herself more strongly with the Whigs, who supported the Duke of Marlborough in the war; and the Whigs hoped to utilise Sarah's position as royal favourite. Anne refused to appoint Sunderland: she disliked the radical Whigs, whom she saw {{as a threat to}} her royal prerogative. Sarah used her close friendship with the Earl of Godolphin, whom Anne trusted, to eventually secure such appointments, but continued to lobby Anne herself. She sent Whig reading materials to Anne in an attempt to win her over to her own preferred political party. In 1704, Anne confided to Lord Godolphin that she did not think she and Sarah could ever be true friends again.|$|E

5|$|At {{the church}} council, Reverend Lovejoy tells Marge to use Christmas to bribe her back. Marge bakes cookies, decorates the home, and has Ralph and Milhouse dress as a pony in {{wrapping}} paper to tempt her, but Lisa {{runs from the}} home when she realizes what is happening. At the Buddhist temple she tells Richard Gere her family tried to trick her, but Gere informs her that while Buddhism is about one finding inner peace, it is also about respecting the diversity of other religions based on love <b>and</b> <b>compassion</b> - thus, Lisa is free to celebrate any holiday with her family including Christmas. Lisa goes back home, falling asleep beside the Christmas tree and tells everyone {{that she will be}} celebrating Christmas with them and continue paying lip service to Christianity while practicing Buddhism {{for the rest of her}} life. As Marge takes her to the kitchen to get some cookies for her, Lisa asks about her pony, and Marge tries unsuccessfully to change the subject as Lisa calls out for her gift.|$|E
5|$|The {{radicals}} refused, however, {{to recognize}} {{themselves in the}} novel's pages (Dimitri Pisarev ridiculed the notion that Raskolnikov's ideas could be identified {{with those of the}} radicals of his time), since Dostoyevsky pursued nihilistic ideas to their most extreme consequences. The aim of these ideas was altruistic and humanitarian, but these aims were to be achieved by relying on reason and suppressing entirely the spontaneous outflow of Christian pity <b>and</b> <b>compassion.</b> Chernyshevsky's utilitarian ethic proposed that thought and will in Man were subject to the laws of physical science.* Hudspith (2003), 95 Dostoyevsky believed that such ideas limited man to a product of physics, chemistry and biology, negating spontaneous emotional responses. In its latest variety of Bazarovism, Russian nihilism encouraged the creation of an élite of superior individuals to whom the hopes of the future were to be entrusted.|$|E
5|$|Todd was {{initially}} a short-term villain, but his popularity {{with the audience}} and critics inspired the writers to forgo killing him or permanently sending him to prison, like most soap operas had done with rapists in the past. While keeping aspects of his personality dark or violent, they had Todd exhibit a conscience <b>and</b> <b>compassion.</b> They took steps to redeem him and made him {{an integral part of}} OLTL canvas, despite Howarth's objections to a redemption storyline. With the use of literary techniques for the redemptive arc, the writers borrowed from nineteenth-century melodrama and Gothic traditions, and literature such as Frankenstein. Todd became the product of an affair between his father, Victor Lord, and his mother, Irene Manning, which provided him a fortune and ties to other major characters, including his sisters, Tina and Victoria Lord. An important aspect of the character became his appearance, most notably the scar on his right cheek, which emerged as synonymous with him and served to remind him of his past misdeeds against Marty. Music and the use of humor were also key to Todd's development. Although he formed many relationships (including with his wives, Blair Cramer and Téa Delgado), and fathered children, a defining characteristic of his personality was his resistance to close relationships and sexual intimacy.|$|E

40|$|While {{social workers}} strive to build {{disadvantaged}} African American youths’ resilience by improving services, rarely are those youths’ perspectives included in research. In a previous evaluation of an after-school program, disadvantaged African American youths prioritized instructors’ <b>compassion</b> <b>and</b> said <b>compassion</b> engendered hope. This study explores their connection between <b>compassion</b> <b>and</b> hope more deeply. Focusing on Snyder’s hope theory, {{this study examines}} the connection between <b>compassion</b> <b>and</b> hope as individual traits (using standardized scales) and as relational, action-based experiences (using qualitative analysis of interview data). Instructor actions that youths identified as compassionate and as engendering hope were encouragement, problem solving, responsive empathy, and affirming that good choices could bring about good futures.

40|$|<b>Compassion</b> <b>and</b> pride serve {{contrasting}} social functions: Compassion motivates care-taking behavior, whereas pride {{enables the}} signaling and negotiation of rank within social hierarchies. Across 3 studies, compassion {{was associated with}} increased perceived self-other similarity, particularly to weak or vulnerable others. In contrast, pride was associated with an enhanced sense of similarity to strong others, and a decreased sense of similarity to weak others. These findings were obtained using trait measures (Study 1) and experimental inductions (Studies 2 <b>and</b> 3) of <b>compassion</b> <b>and</b> pride, examining the sense of similarity to strong or weak groups (Studies 1 and 2) and unfamiliar individuals (Study 3). The influences of <b>compassion</b> <b>and</b> pride on perceived self-other similarity could not {{be accounted for by}} positive mood, nor was this effect constrained by the ingroup status of the target group or individual. Discussion focuses on the contributions these findings make to an understanding of <b>compassion</b> <b>and</b> pride...|$|R
40|$|Aims: This thesis {{aimed to}} explore the physician’s {{capacity}} for, and their experiences <b>and</b> notions of <b>compassion</b> throughout training <b>and</b> in family practice. Methods: This qualitative study used a phenomenological approach. In-depth interviews with 22 family physicians were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim followed by independent and team coding. Then an iterative and interpretive analysis was conducted. Findings: Participants expressed {{their understanding of the}} definition of <b>compassion</b> <b>and</b> described how it was an important quality in family physicians for both patient and physician satisfaction and effective quality of care. They explained the many factors that influenced physician motivation <b>and</b> capacity for <b>compassion</b> <b>and</b> the connection they developed with their patients as a result. Finally, participants described the challenges physicians face to keep compassion in balance throughout training and during their careers. Conclusions: Three core concepts arose from this study: 1) a clear definition of compassion in the family physician; 2) The Compassion Barometer which describes the relationship between physician demonstrations of <b>compassion</b> <b>and</b> patient vulnerability; <b>and</b> 3) The <b>Compassion</b> Trichotomy which describes three interrelated developmental areas that determine the evolution or devolution of compassion in family physicians...|$|R
