25|$|A {{number of}} poets and composers have also drawn {{inspiration}} from his military career. The French 16th-century poet Ronsard wrote a poem <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> did the 19th-century American poet, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Gibbon, the 18th-century historian, holds Skanderbeg in high regard with panegyric expressions.|$|E

25|$|As was the penchant at the time, {{much of what}} Rubinstein played {{were his}} own compositions. At several concerts, Rubinstein alternated between {{conducting}} his orchestral works and playing as soloist {{in one of his}} piano concertos. One high point for him was leading the Leipzig Gewandhaus orchestra in his Ocean Symphony on November 16, 1854. Although reviews were mixed about Rubinstein's merits as a composer, they were more favorable <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a performer when he played a solo recital a few weeks later.|$|E

25|$|Namdev {{was married}} to Rajai and had a son, Vitha, both of whom wrote <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> did his mother, Gonai. Contemporary {{references}} to him by a disciple, a potter, a guru and other close associates also exist. There are no references {{to him in the}} records and inscriptions of the then-ruling family and the first non-Varkari noting of him appears possibly to be in the Lilacaritra, a Mahanubhava-sect biography dating from 1278. Smrtisthala, a later Mahanubhava text from around 1310, may also possibly refer to him; after that, there are no references until a bakhar of around 1538.|$|E
25|$|A Mahafaly individual's social {{identity}} is also defined {{by his or}} her foko - a grouping of all descendants of a living man or woman; an individual belongs simultaneously to multiple foko. Members of a foko typically only gather or work together when the head of the foko is ill, in need of assistance, or has died, in which case the members will organize to take action as needed. An even stronger identity is one's tariha, the living descendants of a male line of descent traced back to a common male ancestor who died recently enough that the oldest members of the group can trace their kinship ties to him and remember some features <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a person. All sacrifices to the ancestors (soro) are made in the name of this common ancestor, and the oldest male tariha member is responsible for carrying out these rituals on behalf of the group. Members of a tariha typically live near each other and form a village or cluster of villages.|$|E

[...] He added that, [...] "In blackening Stalin, the enemies are not concerned <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a person, but their aim is to discredit the Soviet Union, the socialist system, and the international communist movement, consequently, to undermine the workers' faith in socialism." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{director}} of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), J. Edgar Hoover, who had long been suspicious of Chaplin's political leanings, used the opportunity to generate negative publicity <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> <b>As</b> part of a smear campaign to damage Chaplin's image, the FBI named him in four indictments related to the Barry case. Most serious of these was an alleged violation of the Mann Act, which prohibits the transportation of women across state boundaries for sexual purposes. The historian Otto Friedrich has called this an [...] "absurd prosecution" [...] of an [...] "ancient statute", yet if Chaplin was found guilty, he faced 23 years in jail. Three charges lacked sufficient evidence to proceed to court, but the Mann Act trial began in March 1944. Chaplin was acquitted two weeks later. The case was frequently headline news, with Newsweek calling it the [...] "biggest public relations scandal since the Fatty Arbuckle murder trial in 1921." ...|$|E
500|$|Smith {{has said}} of his character: [...] "The Doctor is excited and fascinated by the tiniest of things. By everything. By every single thing. That's what's {{wonderful}} <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a character. It's why children like him, I think. Because he doesn't dismiss anything. He's not cynical. He's open to every single facet of the universe." [...] In June 2010, Smith appeared on stage with Orbital, and performed with them {{a version of the}} Doctor Who theme, at the Glastonbury Festival. Smith hosted the Doctor Who Prom at the Royal Albert Hall on 24–25 July 2010. On the morning of 26 May 2012, Smith carried the Olympic torch in Cardiff, an activity which was noted by Doctor Who fans for its resemblance to a 2006 episode of the show in which the Doctor carried the torch. On 1 June 2013, the BBC announced that Smith would be leaving Doctor Who {{at the end of the}} 2013 Christmas special.|$|E
500|$|A {{year after}} Biko's death, his [...] "Frank Talk" [...] {{writings}} were published as an edited collection, I Write What I Like. The defence that Biko provided for arrested SASO activists {{was used as}} the basis for the 1978 book The Testimony of Steve Biko, edited by Millard Arnold. Woods fled to England that year, where he campaigned against apartheid and further publicised Biko's life and death, writing many newspaper articles <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> well as a book, Biko (1978). This was made into the 1987 film Cry Freedom by Richard Attenborough, starring Denzel Washington as Biko. Many film critics and Black Consciousness proponents were concerned that the film foregrounded white characters like Woods over Biko himself, but Cry Freedom brought Biko's life and activism to a wider audience. The state censors initially permitted its release in South Africa, but after it began screening in the country's cinemas, copies were confiscated by police on the order of Police Commissioner General Hendrik de Wit, who claimed that it would inflame tensions and endanger public safety. The South African government banned many books about Biko, including those of Arnold and Woods.|$|E

500|$|Initially, Horner is {{confident}} that he can seek out the married women {{who are willing to}} have affairs because {{they are the ones who}} do not care about their honor. Horner seems to believe he is in a position of power over the women because their extramarital affair is with him, but his power wanes during the duration of the play. In Act 5, Scene 4, Lady Fidget, Dainty Fidget, and Mistress Squeamish barge into Horner’s lodgings despite his protest, conveying “his lower position that alludes to his disguise: a lowly eunuch.” [...] They talk <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> if he was not present, referring to him as a ‘beast,’ ‘toad,’ and eunuch. Cohen says, “As the ladies grow in aggressive self-confidence, Lady Fidget also ‘claps him on the back’ thereby revealing the altered socio-sexual roles that are now presented.” [...] While Horner thinks he is manipulating the women, he has “exhausted his sexual resources and has, in reality, become that impotent and useless object with the world publicly recognizes him to be.” [...] Horner’s true power is not in relationship to the women, but to the men. He shows his dominance over the men he cuckolds.|$|E
500|$|The show {{focuses on}} the Smith family: Stan Smith, the endangering, , rash and inconsiderate head of the household. He has an exaggeratedly large chin and {{masculine}} manner <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> <b>As</b> the family's breadwinner, {{he works as a}} CIA officer and was initially portrayed in the series as an old-fashioned conservative bigot but has since grown out of these traits (the show is known for its story arc elements and other distinguishing plot techniques); Stan's [...] moralistic yet simultaneously inappropriate, corrupt wife, Francine; and their two children, new-age hippie daughter Hayley and nerdy son Steve. Accompanying the Smith family are three additional main characters, two of which belong to non-human species: zany, shocking, blithely cruel and rascally alien Roger, who's full of disguises/alter egos and has few if any limits on his behaviors. He was rescued by Stan from Area 51; Klaus, the man-in-a-fish-body pet. Klaus's unenviable situation came about from the brain of an East German Olympic skier being shrunk and transplanted into a fish body; and Jeff Fischer, Hayley's boyfriend turned [...] "whipped" [...] husband, known for his infatuation with Hayley's mom, Francine. Together, the Smiths and their three housemates run what is only at a first glance the typical middle-class American lifestyle, but is anything but.|$|E
500|$|Before Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days was released, 1UP.com {{featured}} Roxas {{at the top}} {{of their}} [...] "Why You Should Care About Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days" [...] feature, calling him [...] "The darling of fanfiction and doujinshi writers everywhere," [...] and commenting on what he does during his only year within Organization XIII. Roxas' role as protagonist was described by G4TV as an attempt to [...] "satiate the ravenous fanboy" [...] due to the explanation from his background. While reviewing 358/2 Days, PALGN's Adam Ghiggino praised Roxas' development saying that even gamers who did not like his character in Kingdom Hearts II would care <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> [...] "he evolves from a self-described 'zombie' to a strong-willed and interesting character". Ghiggino especially noted his relationship with Xion and Axel, which he found charming despite the fact that they repeatedly meet {{at the top of}} a clock tower in many scenes. A similar response appeared in Game Informer, which commented that although such scenes were [...] "dull", Roxas' relation with Xion and Axel was appealing and the game's ending would make up for such moments. GamesRadar also commented that Roxas [...] "starts off like a zombie, but rapidly develops a personality" [...] during the title and joked about the numerous times he eats ice cream. His growth during the game was also picked as one of the most enjoyable elements of the title. IGN agreed, calling Roxas' friendship [...] "heart-aching". On the other hand, 1UP.com mentioned that although Roxas' relationship with Xion and Axel is appealing, some of his first missions feel like [...] "lonely, sad affairs". His maneuvers in the game were praised by GameSpot for being easy to learn despite how complex they look, while IGN liked the variation between them.|$|E
