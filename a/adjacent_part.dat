5|$|Each {{member of}} the Order, {{including}} the Sovereign, is allotted a stall in the Chapel, above which his or her heraldic devices are displayed. Perched on the pinnacle of a knight's stall is his helm, decorated with mantling and topped by his crest. If he is a peer, the coronet appropriate to his rank is placed beneath the helm. Under the laws of heraldry, women, other than monarchs, do not normally bear helms nor crests; instead, the coronet alone is used (if she is a peeress or princess). Lady Marion Fraser had a helm and crest included when she was granted arms; these are displayed above her stall {{in the same manner}} as for knights. Unlike other British Orders, the armorial banners of Knights and Ladies of the Thistle are not hung in the chapel, but instead in an <b>adjacent</b> <b>part</b> of St Giles High Kirk. The Thistle Chapel does, however, bear the arms of members living and deceased on stall plates. These enamelled plates are affixed to the back of the stall and display its occupant's name, arms, and date of admission into the Order.|$|E
5|$|The 47th Division {{planned to}} attack with two brigades, each {{reinforced}} by a battalion from the reserve brigade, along {{either side of}} the Ypres–Comines Canal. Large numbers of machine-guns were organised to fire offensive and defensive barrages and signal detachments were organised to advance with the infantry. An observation balloon was reserved for messages by signal lamp from the front line, as insurance against the failure of telephone lines and message-runners. The divisional trench mortar batteries were to bombard the German front line opposite the 142nd Brigade, where it was too close for the artillery to shell without endangering British troops. Wire-cutting began in mid-May, against considerable local retaliation by German artillery. At the end of May the two attacking brigades began training at Steenvoorde, on practice courses built to resemble the German positions to be attacked, using air reconnaissance photographs to mark the positions of machine-gun posts and hidden barbed wire. Divisional intelligence summaries were used to plan the capture of German company and battalion headquarters. The 140th Brigade with four tanks attached, was to occupy White Château and the <b>adjacent</b> <b>part</b> of , while the 142nd Brigade attacked the spoil heaps and the canal bank to the left. On 1 June, the British artillery began the intense stage of preparatory bombardment for trench-destruction and wire cutting and the two attacking brigades assembled for the attack from 4 to 6 June.|$|E

25|$|The amphitheatre {{itself was}} accidentally {{discovered}} in 2004, {{during the early}} constructions of {{what came to be}} known as the Arena di Serdica Hotel. In the modern cityscape of Sofia, the ruins lie south of Knyaz Aleksandar Dondukov Boulevard, between the Goethe-Institut headquarters and the embassy of the United Kingdom. Until the digging of the foundations of a National Electric Company office building in the vicinity in July 2006 came across further ruins, however, it was not clear that the unearthed Roman structure was indeed part of a large arena. The east gate and the section of the amphitheatre within the hotel lot, which is about 1/6th of the entire building, was preserved and incorporated into the hotel's ground floor. It is freely accessible for tourists during the day, except on Mondays, and includes a small expositions of coins and ceramics unearthed on the site. As of 2007, the west gate and the <b>adjacent</b> <b>part</b> of the amphitheatre was being excavated at the National Electric Company lot and a campaign had begun to prevent the construction of the planned building on the site.|$|E

2500|$|In V1 {{the simple}} three-color {{segregation}} begins to break down. Many cells in V1 respond to {{some parts of}} the spectrum better than others, but this [...] "color tuning" [...] is often different depending on the adaptation state of the visual system. A given cell that might respond best to long wavelength light if the light is relatively bright might then become responsive to all wavelengths if the stimulus is relatively dim. Because the color tuning of these cells is not stable, some believe that a different, relatively small, population of neurons in V1 is responsible for color vision. These specialized [...] "color cells" [...] often have receptive fields that can compute local cone ratios. Such [...] "double-opponent" [...] cells were initially described in the goldfish retina by Nigel Daw; their existence in primates was suggested by David H. Hubel and Torsten Wiesel and subsequently proven by Bevil Conway. As Margaret Livingstone and David Hubel showed, double opponent cells are clustered within localized regions of V1 called blobs, and are thought to come in two flavors, red–green and blue–yellow. Red–green cells compare the relative amounts of red–green in one part of a scene with the amount of red–green in an <b>adjacent</b> <b>part</b> of the scene, responding best to local color contrast (red next to green). Modeling studies have shown that double-opponent cells are ideal candidates for the neural machinery of color constancy explained by Edwin H. Land in his retinex theory.|$|E
2500|$|The British attack {{began at}} [...] after a {{bombardment}} of Trônes Wood and Maltz Horn Trench. The 2nd Yorkshire of the 21st Brigade (30th Division) moved through Bernafay Wood and formed {{up along the}} eastern fringe, then began an advance to {{the south end of}} Trônes Wood [...] away. As the battalion topped a rise mid-way to the wood, massed small-arms fire came from a trench in the south-west corner of the wood and caused many casualties. Attempts to continue the advance failed, the survivors withdrew to Bernafay Wood and efforts by bombers to move along Trônes Alley also failed. Troops of the French 39th Division captured Hardecourt Knoll and the <b>adjacent</b> <b>part</b> of Maltz Horn Trench, which left their left flank vulnerable to fire {{from the rest of the}} trench north of Maltz Horn Farm and to machine-guns in the wood. Another attack was arranged by the British 21st Brigade, with the fresh 2nd Wiltshire at [...] after a bombardment of the German trench in the south-west corner of the wood. The troops found that the Germans had been driven out of the trench by the artillery and entered the wood with few casualties, as a company moved from La Briqueterie up a sunken road towards Maltz Horn Farm, to gain touch with the French. As the British approached in dead ground, the French bombed north, up the trench, diverting the German garrison as the British rushed the trench frontally and then repulsed a small counter-attack from the farm. A German counter-attack in the evening from the north end of the wood was also defeated. The captured trench was on the forward slope of Hardecourt Knoll and overnight, German troops dug in on the reverse slope [...] beyond. Maltz Horn Farm lay between the two lines and at [...] a British battalion which had moved up overnight rushed the farm.|$|E

60|$|The {{southern}} {{parts of}} England received their improvements directly through the channel of Rome. The kingdom of Northumberland, {{as soon as}} it was converted, began to contend with the southern provinces in an emulation of piety and learning. The ecclesiastics then [there?] also kept up and profited by their intercourse with Rome; but they found their principal resources of knowledge from another and a more extraordinary quarter. The island of Hii, or Columbkill,[46] is a small and barren rock in the Western Ocean. But in those days it was high in reputation as the site of a monastery which had acquired great renown for the rigor of its studies and the severity of its ascetic discipline. Its authority was extended over all the northern parts of Britain and Ireland; and the monks of Hii even exercised episcopal jurisdiction over all those regions. They had a considerable share both in the religious and literate institution of the Northumbrians. Another island, of still less importance, in the mouth of the Tees [Tweed?], and called Lindisfarne, was about this time sanctified by the austerities of an hermit called Cuthbert. It soon became also a very celebrated monastery. It was, from a dread of the ravages of pirates, removed first to the <b>adjacent</b> <b>part</b> of the continent, and on the same account finally to Durham. The heads of this monastery omitted nothing which could contribute to the glory of their founder and to the dignity of their house, which became, in a very short time, by their assiduous endeavors, the most considerable school perhaps in Europe.|$|E
60|$|Late in {{the same}} season, Corte-Real was back in Lisbon. He had {{discovered}} nothing of immediate profit to the crown of Portugal, but his survey of the coast of North America from Newfoundland to Hudson Strait seems to have strengthened {{the belief that the}} best route to India lay in this direction. In any case, on May 15, 1501, he was sent out again with three ships. This time the Portuguese discovered a region, so they said, which no one had before visited. The description indicates that they were on the coast of Nova Scotia and the <b>adjacent</b> <b>part</b> of New England. The land was wooded with fine straight timber, fit for the masts of ships, and 'when they landed they found delicious fruits of various kinds, and trees and pines of marvellous height and thickness.' They saw many natives, occupied in hunting and fishing. Following the custom of the time, they seized fifty or sixty natives, and crowded these unhappy captives into the holds of their ships, to carry home as evidence of the reality of their discoveries, and to be sold as slaves. These savages are described by those who saw them in Portugal as of shapely form and gentle manner, though uncouth and even dirty in person. They wore otter skins, and their faces were marked with lines. The description would answer to any of the Algonquin tribes of the eastern coast. Among the natives seen on the coast there was a boy who had in his ears two silver rings of Venetian make. The circumstance led the Portuguese to suppose that they were on the coast of Asia, and that a European ship had recently visited the same spot. The true explanation, if the circumstance is correctly reported, would seem to be that the rings were relics of Cabot's voyages and of his trade in the trinkets supplied by the merchants.|$|E

6000|$|As soon as {{they are}} all seated the priest is {{considered}} as [...] inspired, the god being supposed to exist within him from that [...] moment. He remains for a considerable time in silence with his [...] hands clasped before him, his eyes are cast down and he rests [...] perfectly still. During the time the victuals are being shared [...] out and the kava preparing, the matabooles sometimes begin to [...] consult him; sometimes he answers, {{and at other times}} not; [...] in either case he remains with his eyes cast down. Frequently he [...] will not utter a word till the repast is finished and the kava [...] too. When he speaks he generally begins in a low and very [...] altered tone of voice, which gradually rises to nearly its [...] natural pitch, though sometimes a little above it. All that he [...] says {{is supposed to be the}} declaration of the god, and he [...] accordingly speaks in the first person, as if he were the god. [...] All this is done generally without any apparent inward emotion [...] or outward agitation; but, on some occasions, his countenance [...] becomes fierce, and as it were inflamed, and his whole frame [...] agitated with inward feeling; he is seized with an universal [...] trembling, the perspiration breaks out on his forehead, and his [...] lips turning black are convulsed; at length tears start in [...] floods from his eyes, his breast heaves with great emotion, and [...] his utterance is choked. These symptoms gradually subside. [...] Before this paroxysm comes on, and after it is over, he often [...] eats as much as four hungry men under other circumstances could [...] devour. The fit being now gone off, he remains for some time [...] calm and then takes up a club that is placed by him for the [...] purpose, turns it over and regards it attentively; he then looks [...] up earnestly, now to the right, now to the left, and now again [...] at the club; afterwards he looks up again and about him in like [...] manner, and then again fixes his eyes on the club, and so on for [...] several times. At length he suddenly raises the club, and, after [...] a moment's pause, strikes the ground or the <b>adjacent</b> <b>part</b> of the [...] house with considerable force, immediately the god leaves him, [...] and he rises up and retires to the back of the ring among the [...] people (vol. i. pp. 100, 101).|$|E
