40|$|We {{have solved}} the fully 3 -dimensional {{time-dependent}} Schrödinger and Pauli equations for an electron bound in a Coulomb potential, interacting with a superintense electromagnetic (laser) field of high frequency. <b>Adiabatic</b> <b>stabilization</b> is observed at high intensities.

40|$|A {{time-dependent}} non-Hermitian close-coupling {{method is}} developed for describing {{the interplay of}} decaying atomic dressed states in short laser pulses. This interplay accounts {{for a variety of}} phenomena. It is shown, in particular, that the probability that the atom is excited off-resonance is modulated by Stueckelberg oscillations, that the ionization yield may be reduced by dynamical coupling with a resonant and rapidly decaying dressed state, and that <b>adiabatic</b> <b>stabilization</b> of circular states subsists down to very short pulse durations...|$|E
40|$|Photodetachment in ultrastrong laser {{field in}} two spatial {{dimensions}} is investigated numerically. The problem of an <b>adiabatic</b> <b>stabilization</b> is discussed, in particular it is {{shown that a}} quick drift {{in the direction of}} the electric field and a magnetic drift cannot be avoided simultaneously. A qualitative behavior of the packet for a short-range binding potential is contrasted with that for a soft-core potential, in particular dynamical effects due to a rescattering of the fragments separated from the main packet are demonstrated.

40|$|The {{formalism}} {{of complex}} quasienergies {{is used for}} exact calculation of the field-dependent decay rate for a weakly bound particle (in the model of a three-dimensional zero-range potential) in a strong monochromatic laser field. It is shown that the <b>adiabatic</b> (quasistationary) <b>stabilization</b> regime in this model occurs at frequencies ω exceeding the binding energy and only in a limited intensity range. A simple estimate is obtained for the critical field of stabilization breakdown. The effect may be observed for the decay of H– ions {{in the field of}} a neodymium laser of femtosecond duration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{sawtooth}} chip from {{hard cutting}} can {{influence on the}} precision of the form and dimension, the machined surface integrity and the tool life. A study on the microcosmic dynamic fracture mechanism of hardened bearing steel {{carried out by the}} author, based on the microcosmic observing and analysing of sections of the chips from PCBN tools cutting GCr 15 bearing steel. The experiments and analyses indicate that the <b>adiabatic</b> shear loses <b>stabilization</b> in the primary deformation zones due to thermal softening during cutting machining, and shear ductile fracture limitation of the chip forms. The sawtooth chip formation of GCr 15 bearing steel hardened cutting results not from the periodical brittleness fracture but from periodical adiabatic shear fracture; being no clear damnification before the <b>adiabatic</b> shear loses <b>stabilization,</b> thermal softening occurs and be controlled by nucleation, growth and coalescence of microvoids in the whole shear fracture tenacity progress...|$|R
40|$|Although it {{was pointed}} out about 10 years ago that an atomic decay rate might {{decrease}} as the intensity of a high-frequency laser field increases, there still does not exist any complete understanding of either the physical origin of this interesting nonlinear phenomenon or its dependence on the atomic and field parameters. Essentially, the problem consists in that the phenomenon requires a major modification of the standard picture of photoeffect in a strong laser field. In Reference # 1 the origin of this stabilization is related to a particular distortion of an atomic potential by an intense monochromatic high-frequency field. This phenomenon is called <b>adiabatic</b> or quasistationary <b>stabilization</b> (QS). For the case of Rydberg levels, another (interference) mechanism of QS was suggested. Both theories predict an unlimited decrease of the decay rate (or of the width Γ of an atomic level, i. e., of the imaginary part of the complex quasienergy, ε = Re ε – iΓ/ 2) as the laser field amplitude increases. In recent years the idea of “dynamic stabilization” (DS) has become popular. It originates from the pulse form of a laser field rather than from any intrinsic property of the atom in a strong monochromatic field. Within this model the numerous simulations point also to the possibility of a breakdown of stabilization for the case of superintense short laser pulses. However, a recent paper, using the quasistationary quasienergy states (QQES) as an adiabatic basis for the laser pulse has shown that DS has the same (quasistationary) origin as QS. Finally, a number of authors deny the existence of stabilization, in particular, of QS for ionization from a short-range potential and of DS in pulsed fields. Obviously, these controversies and ambiguities are caused by the complexity of the numerical solution of the Cauchy problem for the time-dependent Schrödinger equation in a strong field and by the absence of analyses for exactly solvable analytical models. We analyze the exactly solvable problem of an electron in a three-dimensional, short-range potential and consider the two questions: does a QS-like behavior of the decay rate exist for this model, and, if so, is there an upper intensity limit of the QS regime...|$|R
40|$|Photoionization of the {{circular}} 5 g Rydberg state in neon by an intense subpicosecond light pulse is studied. Both the photoionization yield {{and the remaining}} population are measured. We find that the photoionization yield does not increase when the pulse peak intensity is increased above 60 TW/cm 2, and that a large fraction of the population remains in the 5 g state instead. These {{results are consistent with}} predictions for <b>adiabatic</b> <b>stabilization.</b> The measurements are done using a sequence of three laser pulses. The first laser pulse excites {{the circular}} 5 g state from the neon ground state, the second pulse is the intense light pulse that leads to the ionization (or lack thereof due to stabilization) we actually study, and the third pulse is a low-intensity high-fluence pulse ionizing all of the remaining 5 g population. The photoionization yields of these three pulses are detected and separated by electron spectroscopy...|$|E
40|$|The {{stabilization}} of a one dimensional delta potential model atom under the inuence {{of a high}} frequency, short laser pulse is investigated, through both an ab initio numerical integration of the time-dependent Schr 7 ̆fodinger equation and a Floquet calculation in the single-dressed-state approximation. Provided the intensity is not too high, the variation of the photodetachment probability is explained by <b>adiabatic</b> <b>stabilization</b> and its oscillating behaviour by that of the Floquet rate of photodetachment. PACS numbers: 32. 80. Rm, 42. 50 Hz Numerical evidence of stabilization in intense ultrashort laser pulses have been reported by Su and coworkers, and subsequently by several other groups, {{in a series of}} communications starting in 1990 (Su et al 1990). However, both the correctness and the interpretation of some of these results have recently been questioned in this journal. Besides the formal denition of the word `stabilization', the main focus of disagreement concerns the behaviour o [...] ...|$|E
