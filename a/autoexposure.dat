2500|$|After World War II, {{production}} of the Minox II began in 1948 at a new company, Minox GmbH, in Giessen/Heuchelheim near Wetzlar, West Germany. The new camera very much resembled the original, but was made with a plastic chassis covered by an aluminum shell. This greatly reduced its weight and, to an extent, cost. The camera continued {{to appeal to a}} luxury [...] "gadget" [...] market which broadened during the 1950s and early 1960s. It also continued to see use as an espionage camera by both sides during the Cold War. During this time, the Minox company continued to develop the camera, working with Gossen to develop a companion miniature exposure meter, as well as improved models such as the Minox B, which incorporated an even smaller Gossen-designed meter into the camera itself. The Minox B became the most popular and widely produced model of the line. Further developments included <b>autoexposure,</b> and the company developed an extensive line of accessories. These included flash guns, viewfinder attachments, tripod mounts, and copying stands, all increasing the camera utility in a variety of applications. One accessory even allowed the camera to use a pair of binoculars as a telephoto lens (see illustration). Limited editions of the camera were also produced in a variety of luxury finishes, such as gold plating. Standard cameras were also available in an optional black anodized finish.|$|E
5000|$|... 1960: Royer Savoyflex Automatique (France): first <b>autoexposure</b> SLR. Had an {{unreliable}} mechanical shutter-priority <b>autoexposure</b> system {{controlled by}} an external selenium light meter, Prontor leaf shutter and fixed 50mm f/2.8 Som-Berthiot lens. The first <b>autoexposure</b> still camera was the non-SLR Kodak Super Kodak Six-20 (USA) of 1938 with a mechanical system controlling both aperture and shutter speed via trapped-needle method coupled to external selenium photoelectric cell.|$|E
5000|$|Setting a manual-exposure {{camera to}} expose the film {{properly}} takes two steps, even after taking a light meter reading. <b>Autoexposure</b> systems that greatly simplified the process were a boon when first introduced in the Konica AutoReflex (Autorex in Japan) in 1965. Nikon's <b>autoexposure</b> system was advanced at the EL's launch in 1972, and proved to be long-lived. Nippon Kogaku/Nikon continued to use aperture-priority <b>autoexposure,</b> with considerable development, in the Nikon FE, FE2 and FM3A of the succeeding Nikon compact F-series SLRs until 2006.|$|E
5000|$|Histogram, autofocus, <b>autoexposure,</b> and auto-white-balance (H3A) {{acceleration}} ...|$|E
5000|$|... 1977: Minolta XD11 (Japan; called XD7 in Europe, XD in Japan): first {{dual mode}} <b>autoexposure</b> SLR. Had both aperture-priority and shutter-priority <b>autoexposure.</b> Previously, each AE SLR brand offered {{only one or}} the other mode, and aggressively touted their choice as {{superior}} to other. The XD11 offered both modes and trumped the debate.|$|E
5000|$|Type: 35mm SLR with autofocus, <b>autoexposure,</b> {{built-in}} {{motor drive}} and flash.|$|E
50|$|The Nikkormat EL-series {{were also}} tough and reliable, {{but as with}} all first {{generation}} <b>autoexposure</b> SLRs, they are not considered as handy as later generations with better electronics. With the size and weight of older mechanical SLRs, but with fewer features than succeeding <b>autoexposure</b> SLRs, the ELs are not as popular today as the newer Nikon FE and FE2.|$|E
5000|$|Program AE (<b>autoexposure).</b> In this {{standard}} mode, the camera judges the shutter speed and aperture for average photographic scenes.|$|E
50|$|The F2S Photomic (DP-2 head) and F2SB Photomic (DP-3 head) also {{accepted}} the unusual Nikon DS-1 or DS-2 EE Aperture Control Units. The F2AS (DP-12) required the equivalent DS-12. These were early attempts by Nippon Kogaku to provide shutter priority <b>autoexposure</b> by having an electric servomotor automatically turn the lens aperture ring {{in response to}} the set shutter speed and light meter reading. The DS-1, -2 and -12 were bulky, slow and unreliable, and were feeble and inelegant attempts to add <b>autoexposure</b> to the manual exposure F2.|$|E
50|$|The camera {{featured}} an autofocus {{system based}} on six linear CCD sensors, on-film data recording and an MTF <b>autoexposure</b> mode which chooses the aperture for maximum sharpness.|$|E
5000|$|... 1992: Nikonos RS (Japan): first {{waterproof}} 35 mm system SLR for 100 m maximum depth, underwater diving use. Had autofocus, <b>autoexposure,</b> TTL autoflash, excellent {{interchangeable lenses}} and good accessory system.|$|E
50|$|The Nikon F-601m is {{a manual}} focus, <b>autoexposure,</b> auto film loading and {{advancing}} 35 mm SLR camera manufactured by the Nikon Corporation and released in 1990. It {{was sold in}} USA as the N6000.|$|E
5000|$|Focal Length Indexing Ridge. AI-S lenses with a {{focal length}} of 135mm or longer are {{indicated}} by a ridge on the lens mount, used by FA, F-501, and F4 to engage high-speed-biased Program <b>Autoexposure.</b>|$|E
50|$|The major {{improvements}} of the FG {{compared to the}} EM were improved exterior cosmetics, internal printed circuit electronics, {{the addition of the}} manual exposure and programmed <b>autoexposure</b> modes, and provision for TTL flash automation.|$|E
5000|$|... 1968: Konica Autoreflex T (Japan): first SLR with {{internal}} open aperture TTL metering <b>autoexposure</b> (mechanical shutter-priority). Was an improved Konica AutoReflex (see above) {{with internal}} CdS centerweighted light meter and reduced shutter button travel, but without half frame capability.|$|E
50|$|Upon its release, the Rebel Ti had {{the fastest}} {{autofocus}} and most advanced <b>autoexposure</b> in its class. Among the more welcomed improvements {{was the new}} stainless steel lens mount, replacing the less durable plastic mount found on previous EOS Rebel cameras.|$|E
50|$|As {{the first}} {{generation}} of matrix metering, AMP was hardly foolproof. For instance, holding the FA vertically instead of horizontally might cause the meter to give different readings of the same scene. However, AMP was still demonstrably superior to the centerweighted type of light metering then in common use. AMP would give a good exposure 90-95% of the time versus 85-90% for centerweighting. Note that AMP was automatically disabled in the FA's manual exposure mode and could be turned off in the <b>autoexposure</b> modes. In both cases, the FA would default to Nippon Kogaku's traditional 60/40% centerweighted metering. However, the FA omitted the <b>autoexposure</b> memory lock of the FE2 - AMP was supposed to obviate any need for it.|$|E
50|$|The Nikon FA was {{a mostly}} metal, heavily {{computerized}} {{version of the}} Nikon FE2. The FA was a battery-powered (two SR44 or LR44, or one 1/3N) electromechanically (much electronics, but many springs, gears and levers) controlled manual focus SLR with manual exposure control or aperture priority, shutter priority and programmed <b>autoexposure.</b> The FA was Nippon Kogaku's first SLR to have shutter priority <b>autoexposure</b> and first to have {{all four of the}} now standard PASM exposure modes. The FA actually had two programmed modes: a normal mode and a High Speed mode that automatically biased toward faster shutter speeds whenever an AI-S compatible lens (including Series E) of 135 mm or longer focal length was mounted.|$|E
50|$|Programmed <b>autoexposure,</b> in many variations, {{became a}} {{standard}} camera feature by the mid-1980s. This is {{the order of}} first introduction of 35 mm SLRs, by brand, with a computer programmed <b>autoexposure</b> mode, before the rise of autofocus (see next section): 1978, Canon A-1 (plus AE-1 Program, 1981 and T50, 1983); 1980, Fujica AX-5; 1980, Leica R4; 1981, Mamiya ZE-X; 1982, Konica FP-1; 1982, Minolta X-700; 1982, Nikon FG (plus FA, 1983); 1983, Pentax Super Program (plus Program Plus, 1984 and A3000, 1985); 1983, Chinon CP-5 Twin Program (also first with two program modes); 1984, Ricoh XR-P (tied with Canon T70 as first with three program modes); 1985, Olympus OM-2S Program; 1985, Contax 159MM; 1985, Yashica FX-103. Of the brands active in the mid-1970s, Cosina, Miranda, Petri, Praktica, Rolleiflex, Topcon and Zenit never introduced programmed 35 mm SLRs; usually the inability {{to make the transition}} forced the company to quit the 35 mm SLR business altogether. Note that the Asahi Pentax Auto 110, Pentax Auto 110 Super (Pocket Instamatic 110 SLRs from 1978 and 1982) and Pentax 645 (a 645 format SLR from 1985) also had programmed <b>autoexposure.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Nikon F-301 (sold in the United States as the N2000) is {{a manual}} focus, <b>autoexposure,</b> auto film loading and {{advancing}} 35 mm SLR camera that was {{sold by the}} Nikon Corporation beginning in 1985. It was the replacement for the FG.|$|E
50|$|The camera allows {{variable}} Program <b>autoexposure,</b> {{as well as}} aperture-priority and shutter-priority automatic {{exposure and}} manual exposure. Another option is Depth-of-field AE (DEP), an automatic mode that selects the focusing distance and aperture f-number to place the depth of field between two user-specified near and far points.|$|E
5000|$|The Nikkormat EL was an all-metal, electromechanically (some {{solid-state}} electronics, {{but mostly}} springs, gears and levers) controlled, manual-focus SLR with manual exposure control or aperture-priority <b>autoexposure,</b> manufactured in Japan from 1972 to 1976. It {{was available in}} two colors: black with chrome trim and all black.|$|E
50|$|As Nippon Kogaku's first {{electronic}} <b>autoexposure</b> camera, the EL {{required a}} battery (one 6V PX28 or one 4SR44 {{in the bottom}} of the mirror box) to power its electronically-controlled, metal-bladed, vertical-travel, focal-plane shutter with a speed range of four seconds to 1/1000 second (plus Bulb and flash X-sync at 1/125th second).|$|E
50|$|The FA {{could also}} use the older Nikkor AI (introduced in 1977) and AI'd Nikkor lenses, but in that case, the AMP meter and the shutter {{priority}} and High Speed program <b>autoexposure</b> modes would not {{work as well as}} AI-S lenses allowed (this is due to their non-linear aperture stop-down mechanisms).|$|E
50|$|The MX was solidly built, and {{featured}} a fully mechanical construction, including a mechanical shutter of the horizontal cloth type. Only the light metering system {{was dependent on}} batteries. The MX is all manual: it does not feature autofocus or <b>autoexposure</b> modes such as aperture-priority, shutter-speed priority, or full program.|$|E
5000|$|D — Distance. Indicated {{after the}} {{f-number}} in the name, and also occasionally designated AF-D. The integrated CPU electronically communicates focus distance information, which is {{incorporated into the}} camera's exposure calculations in 3D Matrix Metering mode, and also D-TTL and I-TTL flash <b>autoexposure.</b> All AF-I, AF-S, and G-type lenses are also D-type.|$|E
50|$|The Genesis camera family {{consisted}} of 4 models (see table below), each new model replacing the previous one. All models had a fixed zoom, motorized stepless autofocus, <b>autoexposure,</b> a built-in pop-up flash, motorized film transport, and automatic (DX) film sensing. The first two releases had fairly boxy designs; {{the latter two}} were given a sleeker, more rounded look.|$|E
50|$|In {{common with}} other manufacturers' first-generation {{electronic}} <b>autoexposure</b> SLRs, the EL {{had a reputation}} for rapidly draining batteries; later models had much more energy-efficient electronics. Note that the EL would still function without batteries in a very limited fashion: fully mechanical operation, with only one shutter speed available (an unmarked, fixed 1/90 second) and without the light meter.|$|E
50|$|The {{external}} iSight's ¼-inch color CCD sensor has 640×480-pixel VGA resolution, with a custom-designed three-part F/2.8 lens {{with two}} aspherical elements. It features <b>autoexposure,</b> autofocusing from 50 mm to infinity, and video capture at 30 {{frames per second}} in 24-bit color {{with a variety of}} shutter speeds. However, the iSight has an image delay of approximately 120 ms.|$|E
5000|$|The Canon EOS 5 (sold as the EOS A2 and A2e in the USA) is a semi-professional autofocus, <b>autoexposure</b> 35 mm SLR film camera. It {{was sold}} from November 1992 onwards, and was {{replaced}} in late 1998 by the Canon EOS 3. [...] As part of the EOS line of cameras, the 5/A2/A2e utilized Canon's EF bayonet lens mount, first introduced in 1987.|$|E
50|$|The K1000 {{gained a}} unique {{popularity}} and sold well {{for many years}} as its lack of features came to be regarded an important feature in and of itself. Its spartan nature, without <b>autoexposure</b> or autofocus, meant a sturdy and reliable camera for a low price. The K1000 became highly recommended for student photographers as it forced them to focus on basics of exposure and composition.|$|E
50|$|Asahi Optical was {{an early}} and {{enthusiastic}} participant in this competition. The Asahi Pentax Electro Spotmatic (Honeywell Pentax Spotmatic ES in the USA) of 1971 was the first 35 mm SLR with electronic aperture priority <b>autoexposure</b> and the Pentax ME was the first electronic autoexposure-only 35 mm SLR. Asahi Optical {{was also the first}} company to offer publicly available anti-reflection multicoated photographic lenses with their SMC Takumar lenses in 1971.|$|E
50|$|The Olympus OM-4, an {{improved}} {{version of the}} OM-2, was manufactured from 1983 to 1987. It was introduced at a US$685 list price for the body alone. It was a battery-powered, electromechanically controlled, manual focus SLR with manual exposure control or aperture priority <b>autoexposure.</b> It used a horizontal cloth focal plane shutter with a speed range of 240s (in auto mode) to 1/2000s plus bulb, and flash X-sync of 1/60s.|$|E
5000|$|The Nikon D90 is {{the first}} Nikon camera to include a third {{firmware}} module, labeled [...] "L," [...] which provides an updateable lens distance integration database that improves <b>autoexposure</b> functions. Some of its accessories, such as the MB-D80 battery grip and ML-L3 wireless remote, are also compatible with its predecessor the D80. It supports Global Positioning System integration for automatic location tagging of photographs, using a GPS receiver sold separately.|$|E
50|$|Except {{for having}} an {{enormous}} variety of lenses {{with the popular}} K mount to choose from, the K1000 has fewer features compared to higher-level SLRs of the mid 1970s. The camera has a flash synchronization speed of 1/60th second, a sleeve-bushing equipped shutter and film advance mechanism, no self timer, no depth-of-field preview, no mirror lockup, no interchangeable focusing screens, no motor drive option, and no <b>autoexposure.</b> The K1000 is a completely manual camera.|$|E
50|$|<b>Autoexposure,</b> {{technically}} {{known as}} semi-automatic exposure, where the camera's metering system chooses either the shutter speed or the aperture, was finally {{introduced by the}} Savoyflex and popularized by Konishiroku in the 1965 Konica Auto-Reflex. This camera was of the 'shutter-priority' type automation, which meant that the camera selected the correct aperture automatically. This model also had the interesting ability to photograph in 35 mm full-frames or half-frames, all selected by a lever.|$|E
