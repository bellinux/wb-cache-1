5|$|A {{cold-core low}} {{pressure}} system near Gustav was forecast to have <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{development of the}} system; however, the tropical storm continued to intensify, attaining hurricane status around 1200UTC on August26. Not long after attaining hurricane-status, the ridge steering Gustav to the west began to break down, causing the hurricane to slowly turn towards the north. By 0600UTC on August27, the storm attained Category 2 intensity, with winds of 100mph (155km/h). Later that day, the storm made its closest approach to the Lesser Antilles, passing 205miles (330km) to the east. By this time, hurricane and tropical storm-force winds extended 35miles (55km) and 175miles (280km) from the center respectively.|$|E
5|$|Anisotropy {{of liquid}} {{crystals}} is a property not observed in other fluids. This anisotropy makes flows of liquid crystals behave more differentially {{than those of}} ordinary fluids. For example, injection of a flux of a liquid crystal between two close parallel plates (viscous fingering) causes orientation of the molecules to couple with the flow, with the resulting emergence of dendritic patterns. This anisotropy is also manifested in the interfacial energy (surface tension) between different liquid crystal phases. This anisotropy determines the equilibrium shape at the coexistence temperature, and {{is so strong that}} usually facets appear. When temperature is changed one of the phases grows, forming different morphologies depending on the temperature change. Since growth is controlled by heat diffusion, anisotropy in thermal conductivity favors growth in specific directions, which has also <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> final shape.|$|E
5|$|As {{damage is}} dealt by units within the CO zone, the CO's power meter fills slightly, {{at a rate}} of one bar per five hit points worth of damage inflicted. As the CO power meter is filled, the CO zone grows larger. When the meter is full, the CO can {{activate}} his power which has <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> whole battlefield, such as repairing allied units, damaging enemy units, or temporarily altering weather conditions. In addition, the offensive and defensive boosts that normally apply only in the CO zone, also applies to all allied units on the whole battlefield for the turn that the CO power is active. If the CO unit is destroyed, the CO meter empties and the CO returns to the HQ, able to be redeployed with another unit.|$|E

5|$|Chaplin {{founded a}} new {{production}} company, Attica, and used Shepperton Studios for the shooting. Filming in England proved a difficult experience, {{as he was}} used to his own Hollywood studio and familiar crew, and no longer had limitless production time. According to Robinson, this had <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> quality of the film. A King in New York was released in September 1957, and received mixed reviews. Chaplin banned American journalists from its Paris première and decided not to release the film in the United States. This severely limited its revenue, although it achieved moderate commercial success in Europe. A King in New York was not shown in America until 1973.|$|E
5|$|En route, the {{presence}} of the Orions begins having <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> crew: men become increasingly aggressive, while women increasingly suffer from headaches. Navaar focuses her attentions on Archer, while D'Nesh seduces Commander Kelby. Arriving at the planet, a sluggish Archer orders Reed to destroy another ship, but he refuses and it escapes. Kelby meanwhile sabotages the warp drive before Commander Tucker can physically stop him. Afterwards, Doctor Phlox determines that the Orions are producing pheromones, causing the crew's adrenaline levels to spike. Only Commander T'Pol and Tucker remain unaffected, since she is Vulcan and he shares her immunity because of their psychic bond.|$|E

After the annexation of Austria, the Austrian team was {{absorbed into the}} German team, resulting in the inclusion of several Austrians in Germany's 1938 World Cup squad. After World War II and the break-up of Germany, two breakaway national teams were formed: Saarland (1950–56) and East Germany (1952–90). During this period, the team was commonly known as West Germany until the country's reunification in 1990, when the East German team was reintegrated into the German national team.|$|E

5|$|The {{failure of}} the {{supplies}} and reinforcements carried on Thétis to reach the Caribbean may have had <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outcome of the subsequent invasion of Martinique in January 1809. Except for one reinforcement frigate, Amphitrite, none of the subsequent French efforts to transport supplies or soldiers to Martinique were successful, and a large British expeditionary force was able to overwhelm the island's poorly-supplied defenders in a brief campaign. The tightening blockade also affected other French colonies, preventing the despatch of food and military supplies and contributing to the captures of both Île de France and Guadeloupe in 1810.|$|E

Árbenz had intended the secret shipment of weapons from the Alfhem to be used to bolster peasant militias, in the event of army disloyalty. But the U.S. informed army chiefs of the shipment, forcing Árbenz to hand them over to the military, and deepening the rift between him and his top generals.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{inherent}} difficulties in accounting for inflation, several {{attempts have been}} made. Estimates depend on the price index used to adjust the grosses, and the exchange rates used to convert between currencies can also impact upon the calculations, both of which can have <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ultimate rankings of an inflation adjusted list. Gone with the Wind—first released in 1939—is {{generally considered to be}} the most successful film, with Guinness World Records in 2014 estimating its adjusted global gross at $3.4 billion. Estimates for Gone with the Winds adjusted gross have varied substantially: its owner, Turner Entertainment, estimated its adjusted earnings at $3.3 billion in 2007, a few years earlier than the Guinness estimate; other estimates fall either side of this amount, with one putting its gross just under $3 billion in 2010, while another provided an alternative figure of $3.8 billion in 2006. Which film is Gone with the Winds nearest rival depends on the set of figures used: Guinness had Avatar in second place with $3 billion, while other estimates saw Titanic in the runner-up spot with first-run worldwide earnings of almost $2.9 billion at 2010 prices. The only other film that all sources agreed grossed in excess of $2 billion at recent prices is Star Wars; according to Guinness it has earned $2.8 billion at 2014 price levels, while other sources from 2010/2011 put its adjusted earnings at $2.2–2.6 billion.|$|E
5|$|Peter {{continued}} to control Pevensey Castle after de Montford's defeat and {{death at the}} Battle of Evesham in August 1265. It became Crown property after Peter's death, when Henry III's queen Eleanor of Provence acquired the castle. It remained with the Crown for another century {{under the control of}} several queens consort, including Edward II's wife Isabella and Edward III's wife Philippa, who were responsible for appointing the castle's Constables. By this time, the silting of Pevensey Bay was evidently having <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> garrison's ability to resupply via the sea. Accounts from 1288 indicate that seaborne access was becoming increasingly difficult, causing problems in unloading goods. However, it {{continued to}} {{play a significant role in}} the defence of the south coast against French raids and was occupied through much of the 14th century by a garrison consisting of between twenty and thirty men. These usually comprised ten men-at-arms, twenty archers and a watchman, who were supplied with provisions and armour. The Duke of Lancaster, John of Gaunt, refused to garrison it in 1377 five years after he took possession of the castle, asserting that he was wealthy enough to rebuild it if a French attack destroyed it. His actions attracted public hostility which culminated during the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 when a mob attacked the castle, burnt its court rolls and abused the steward.|$|E
5|$|The Yukon Quest's rules allow race {{officials}} latitude {{on whether}} to assess a time penalty or monetary fine on mushers who violate one or more regulations. The most serious penalties can be assessed for mistreating dogs. Racers have been forcibly removed from the race for inadequate dog care; the most recent instance of this took place in 2008, when Donald Smidt was removed. More common are minor time and monetary penalties. For example, Dan Kaduce was fined $500 of his eventual $9,000 winnings for missing roll call at a mandatory meeting in 2007. Fines of $500 also have been levied for not attending the finish banquet, littering, not wearing start and finish bibs, or losing veterinary records. These minor penalties can have <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> race. In 2009, Hugh Neff, then in second place, was penalized two hours for mushing on the Circle Hot Springs road. As a result, he finished four minutes behind Sebastian Schnuelle, the winner.|$|E
