40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between checks <b>and</b> <b>balances</b> <b>and</b> democracy, focusing on Turkey in comparative perspective. In a large-N setting, the effects of checks <b>and</b> <b>balances</b> {{on the quality of}} democracy are examined. The findings reinforce the essential relationship between democracy <b>and</b> checks <b>and</b> <b>balances.</b> The article then discusses the implications of the the findings for Turkey. It stresses the need for horizontal accountability via checks <b>and</b> <b>balances</b> vested in different state agencies. In addition to state-level checks <b>and</b> <b>balances,</b> the importance of societal actors as sources of accountability is also elaborated. The study identifies the need for vertical accountability, not only through free elections but also by creating a political setting in which pluralistic media and civil society can thrive. In light of findings, the article stresses the need for a new constitutional framework that can embrace both state- and societal-level checks <b>and</b> <b>balances.</b> © 2015 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
40|$|Voters often {{dismantle}} constitutional checks <b>and</b> <b>balances</b> on the executive. If such checks <b>and</b> <b>balances</b> limit presidential {{abuses of}} power and rents, why do voters support their removal? We argue that by reducing politician rents, checks <b>and</b> <b>balances</b> also make it cheaper to bribe or in‡uence politicians through non-electoral means. In weakly-institutionalized polities where such non-electoral in‡uences, particularly by the better organized elite, are a major concern, voters may prefer a political system without checks <b>and</b> <b>balances</b> {{as a way of}} insulating politicians from these in‡uences. When they do so, they are e¤ectively accepting a certain amount of politician (presidential) rents in return for redistribution. We show that checks <b>and</b> <b>balances</b> are less likely to emerge when (equilibrium) politician rents are low; when the elite are better organized {{and are more likely to}} be able to in‡uence or bribe politicians; and when inequality and potential taxes are high (which makes redistribution more valuable to the majority). We show that the main intuition, that checks <b>and</b> <b>balances,</b> by making politicians “cheaper to bribe, ” are potentially costly to the majority, is valid under di¤erent ways of modeling the form of checks <b>and</b> <b>balances...</b>|$|R

5|$|Hearing <b>and</b> <b>balance</b> {{are both}} {{generated}} in the inner ear. The movement of liquids within the inner ear is generated by motion (for balance) and transmitted vibrations generated by the ossicles (for sound). This creates a nerve signal that passes through the vestibulocochlear nerve. From here, it passes through to the cochlear nuclei, the superior olivary nucleus, the medial geniculate nucleus, and finally the auditory radiation to the auditory cortex.|$|E

5|$|Manganism is a biphasic disorder. In {{its early}} stages, an {{intoxicated}} person may experience depression, mood swings, compulsive behaviors, and psychosis.
