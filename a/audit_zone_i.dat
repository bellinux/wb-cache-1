This dike {{is composed of}} three <b>zones</b> <b>I,</b> II and III.

Therefore, because the joint pattern of <b>zone</b> <b>I</b> is not symmetrical, and narrow spacing pattern near the dike wall is lacking in its zone II-side, zone II intruded between preexisting <b>zone</b> <b>I</b> and weakly, consolidated host rock, and <b>zone</b> <b>I</b> was eroded partly.

40|$|Joint {{probability}} density functions (JPDFs) {{can be used}} to describe the likelihood of spatial position or events that are dependent on spatial position. Event-based JPDFs are often based on computational outcomes at specific locations, where the number of potential locations may be unlimited. The efficiency and accuracy associated with the estimation of the conditional failure JPDF is dependent on the number of spatial locations and the number of limit state evaluations at each spatial location. An approach is presented for the estimation of a fracture mechanics-based conditional failure JPDF within a finite domain. An approximate JPDF is constructed using probability of fracture values associated with anomalies placed at discrete points along the perimeter of the component and at selected locations within the interior of the component. The discrete points are connected to form a mesh of elements, and anomaly occurrence rates are assigned to elements based on their relative volumes. The final JPDF is obtained from an adaptive refinement of the element mesh where elements are subdivided based on contribution to component risk. The results {{can be applied to the}} risk assessment of components that are susceptible to fracture failure.

40|$|A {{thermal model}} has been {{developed}} for the heating of a greenhouse by using inner thermal curtain and natural flow of geothermal warm water through the polyethylene tube laid on its floor.

40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of setariasis in cattle and cerebrospinal nematodiasis in {{sheep and goats}} were determined in two geographical regions of Iran. Methods: In two provinces of Iran: Mazandaran (<b>zone</b> <b>I)</b> and Qazvine (zoneII)    where sheep and goats were suffering from symptoms similar to cerebrospinal nematodiasis, the peritoneal cavities of  763 and 1020 cattle were searched for adult Setaria sp. respectively. History taking of 4770 sheep from <b>zone</b> <b>I</b> and 25550 sheep and 3190 goats from zone II were per­formed for the presence and determination of cerebrospinal nematodiasis in sheep and goats. To study pathological changes induced in central nervous system 7 sheep from <b>zone</b> <b>I</b> and 4 sheep and 2 goats from zone II with symptoms similar to CSN were necropsied. Results: Our findings revealed that 47 % and 13. 2 % of cattle in <b>zone</b> <b>I</b> and II harboured Setaria digitata (99. 45 %) and S. digitata (67. 12 %) plus S. labiato-papillosa (17. 46 %) respectively. History taking showed that each year 2. 53 % of sheep in <b>zone</b> <b>I</b> and 1. 65 % of sheep and 1. 25 % of goats in some districts of zone II (e. g. Roudbar Alamout)   suffered from symp­toms similar to cerebrospinal nematodiasis the main clinical signs of which were difficulty in hind limbs movement (lumbar paralysis). At necropsy, no lesions were observed macroscopically in the brains as well as spinal cords. But in a few cases, central nervous system were congested  and edematous. Histopathological examination of CNS of necropsied animals showed mild leptomeningitis and eosinophilic and lymphacytic encephalomyelitis with numerous hemorrhagic tracts, degeneration and necrosis due to migration of the larvae. The cross section of nematode larvae was observed in the brain section of a sheep in <b>zone</b> <b>I.</b> Conclusion: The {{results of this study}} showed that setariasis of cattle is very prevalent in both region mainly in <b>zone</b> <b>I</b> and sheep and goats harbor low percentage of CSN but with marked pathological lesions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this contribution, {{we examine}} a dynamic model {{describing}} {{the evolution of}} internal climate conditions in a closed environment partitioned into zones for which different climate conditions must be guaranteed. The zones are not separated, large air masses are exchanged among them, and the behavior of each zone is strongly affected by those in the neighbor zones. We discuss a control strategy which, by acting on the heating and ventilation devices of the overall system, is able to achieve the control task while efficiently managing the internal flow. It is {{pointed out that the}} controller is hybrid and decentralized. An additional feature of the controller is that it takes on values in a finite set. The possible implementation in a networked environment is briefly discussed.
