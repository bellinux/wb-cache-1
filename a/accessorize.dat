25|$|Fashion Bonnets {{for outdoor}} wear had small brims that {{revealed}} the face. Earlier bonnets {{of the decade}} had lower brims. However, by mid-century Spoon Bonnets, which featured increasingly high brims and more elaborate trimmings, became the vogue. Bonnets were made specifically to <b>accessorize</b> a dress.

500|$|When Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) {{ends up in}} a coma on life support, Jo Bennett (Kathy Bates) makes Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{the interim}} {{regional}} manager before they find a proper replacement, much to Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) chagrin, as the office had actually functioned very smoothly during the manager hiatus. As Jim notes, everyone showed up, worked for the day with reasonable breaks, and were highly productive. Once appointed, Dwight establishes a strict management style {{in stark contrast to}} their previously relaxed style, from making the employees say the Pledge of Allegiance to setting up firewalls and long passwords to use the office's various machines and installing antique punch clocks. Jim, who had turned down the temporary manager position believing that they should not be assigned one at all, is especially unhappy with the changes, and begins pranking Dwight by suggesting that he is leading an uprising called [...] "The Fist". In order to impress Jo, Dwight buys a gun, though he is more excited when he receives a holster as a gift from a relative, and uses the gun to <b>accessorize.</b> Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) insists that he put it away, but Dwight accidentally fires the gun right by Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), causing him temporary hearing loss. Dwight attempts to bribe the office workers into silence with various favors, and Jim insists that Dwight do outlandish things (such as saying [...] "Shagedelic, baby") at certain promptings.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Emil Gayk" [...] sketch was {{the only}} one which is {{precisely}} dated to the early stages of World War I, focusing its satire on the debates of neutralists and interventionists. Gayk, the ever-vigilant, gun-tauting, bird-like civilian, who sleeps in his tailcoat but otherwise wears only a festooned drape, swims about in just one direction ("for fear of coming out of his neutrality") and gets inspired by the military muses. His career is in foreign relations, which he revolutionizes with such novel ideas as the negotiated annexation of a unidimensional, arrow-like, territory at Năsăud—pointed toward Luxembourg, in memory of the 1914 invasion. Gayk has an adoptive daughter, educated on his behalf by waiters, who makes her home in the fields and eventually demands access to the sea. Angered by this claim, Gayk begins a large-scale war against her; the conflict ends in a stalemate, as Gayk can no longer <b>accessorize</b> his marshal's uniform, and the girl has lost her supplies of gasoline and beans. The father is placated with regular gifts of feed grain, whereas the daughter is allowed a two-centimeter-wide littoral.|$|E

2500|$|Only in San Francisco {{could the}} Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence not only make their first appearance, but become {{interwoven}} {{in the cultural}} and political fabric of the city, according to scholar Cathy Glenn in the journal Theory and Event. Glenn uses the examples of San Francisco as a society of hyperpluralism, where all the groups who have called the city their home have successfully maintained their individual identities, creating a culture defined by counterculture and at times marked by political violence. The Sisters use Catholic imagery as simultaneous inspiration and fodder for parody through camp. They choose names based {{on the process of}} renaming women inducted into Catholic orders, but that suggest sexual promiscuity or that are based in absurdity: Sister Anita Blowjob, Sister GladAss of the Joyous Reserectum, Sister Hellena Handbasket, Sister Sensible Shoes, and Sister Homo Celestial, among others. They wear wimples, habits, and robes of nuns, but <b>accessorize</b> them garishly with baubles, beads, and whiteface make-up. Sister Phyllis Stein, the Fragrant Mistress of Sistory, asserts that there is a clear distinction between drag queens and members of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence: [...] "We're not dressed as girls, we're dressed as nuns... We definitely minister to the spiritual needs of our community, while drag queens sort of focus on camp and fun within our communities. We're very different communities. A lot of people refer to us as drag queens, but we say we're in nun drag. We are nuns." ...|$|E
