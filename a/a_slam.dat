25|$|Divac had {{an unusual}} style {{compared}} to most other centers of his generation: despite his height, he possessed good mobility, had good {{control of the}} ball, and was a decent shooter.

25|$|It also re-established Sakuraba's {{proficiency}} {{in dealing with}} larger opponents and placed him back in line for another shot at Wanderlei Silva in Pride's next event, this time to decide Pride's inaugural 205-pound champion. Usually prone to humorous entrances, it was a somber and focused Sakuraba that came down the aisle for his rematch with Silva. As with Jackson, Sakuraba was able to score an early takedown in the bout, where he then worked from Silva's guard. After several minutes searching for an opening, he finally found one when Silva attempted to escape to his feet. Sakuraba locked on a tight guillotine choke, but was countered by <b>a</b> <b>slam</b> from Wanderlei which ended up breaking his collar bone.

25|$|Federer {{entered the}} match {{attempting}} {{to win his}} thirteenth Grand Slam title and a record fifth consecutive in New York, while the 21-year-old Murray had reached the finals of <b>a</b> <b>Slam</b> {{for the first time}} in his career.

Federer would save three break points in the second set and eventually take the set. Federer would run away with the final set, sealing his victory with a pair of overhead smashes. This title pulled Federer within one of the all-time record of 14 majors held by Pete Sampras. Federer's victory also made him the only man to win five consecutive titles at two different majors (Wimbledon 2003-2007 and US Open 2004-2008).|$|E

In 1989, Graf and Navratilova met in the finals of both Wimbledon and the US Open, with Graf winning both encounters in three sets. Despite the 13 year age {{difference between the two}} players, and Graf's comparative lack of investment in doubles and mixed doubles, Navratilova won 9 of the 18 career singles matches with Graf and 5 of the 9 major singles matches with her. At age 34, Navratilova defeated Graf the last time they played in a major in the semifinals of the 1991 US Open 7–6(2), 6–7(6), 6–4, to end their Grand Slam rivalry 5-4 up.

25|$|Industrial hip hop fuses {{the themes}} and {{aesthetics}} of industrial with hip hop music. Its origins {{are in the}} work of Mark Stewart and Adrian Sherwood.

Tackhead, a collaboration between Sherwood and the Sugar Hill band, picked up where Stewart left off. The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, from San Francisco, and Meat Beat Manifesto, from the UK, are also early representatives of the style. The later work of Broadrick's Godflesh, as well as his collaborations with Kevin Martin, Ice, and Techno Animal, are examples of industrial hip hop.
