40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a monomer free bone cement based on {{acrylate}} and its material testing. In its properties, the innovative cement should be more or less similar to the conventional bone cements, but in the best case without most of their disadvantages. The main-disadvantages of conventional bone cements are: Their extreme heat release (up to 70 °C) during the setting reaction, because of the radical polymerisation. Subsequently necrosis in the surrounding natural tissue can develop. Absorption of water can reduce the mechanical properties and toxic remnant of monomer can damage the natural tissue. Shrinkage due to the polymerisation reaction can entail crack increase in the material. The short handling time and the complicated application are also negative properties. Therefore it was necessary to create a fixed and reproducable mixture based on an acid number modified poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) solution in connection with bioceramics (TETRA, GB 14) and other inorganic materials (zinc oxide, calcium circonium phosphate, natrium fluoride, titan dioxide). The innovative bone cement is a 2 -component system. The solvent based on a solution containing ethanol (96 %), carboxylic modified PMMA and <b>acetoacetic</b> acid ethyl <b>ester</b> (AAE). The powder component is a mixture of different types of bioceramics and other inorganic materials. The powder is both an initiator as well as a filling component. The setting reaction depends on the content of zinc ions and calcium ions. The higher the content of zinc ions, the faster the reaction. Seven different compositions of the innovative cement were studied. Their mechanical properties were tested  qualitatively: bending strength, compressive strength and porosity after various storing conditions. Twenty specimen of each variation were prepared. To simulate natural conditions, one group has been tested after 24 hours, the other after 1 week of storage in distilled water at 37 °C. Based on the results of mechanical properties, three variations were selected for further testing of biocompatibility and cell toxicity. The biocompatibility assays were performed using human bone marrow cells in culture in direct contact with the specimen and in contact with liquid extracts containing the cements degradation products. The experimental bone cement has the following advantages: There is no radical polymerisation and no heat release at all. There is no content of toxic components in the innovative material. The experimental bone cement has a good connection to natural tissue (showed by light microscopy) and metal surfaces under dry and wet conditions. Surrounding osteoblasts can grow into the material due to the pore size from up to 250 &# 956;m (showed by SEM). The innovative bone cement has constant material properties. The handling time is up to 10 minutes longer than that of conventional bone cements. It is possible to individualize the time by changing the content of the liquid and the powder fraction, the viscosity is determined by the powder/liquid ratio. Application by syringe is possible. The result showed a very low E-module (8 MPa) in comparison to 50 MPa in conventional bone cements. So it may possible to reduce stress in the metal-cement-bone interface. Although the results are promising, further investigations are necessary to make the required use possible. The results reached under laboratory conditions can give no final assessment of the material...|$|R

40|$|Malononitrile (MN), trifluoroacetic acid anhydride, acetylacetone, <b>acetoacetic</b> <b>ester,</b> and {{diethyl malonate}} have been {{identified}} as novel rate-accelerating additives for nitroxide-mediated living free-radical polymerization. Among these additives, MN has the greatest accelerating effect. Adding MN at an MN/ 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidine-oxyl (TEMPO) molar ratio of 4. 0 results in a nearly 20 times higher rate of polymerization of styrene (St), and adding MN at an MN/TEMPO molar ratio of 2. 5 results in a nearly 15 times higher rate of copolymerization of St and methyl methacrylate. The polymerization of St proceeds in a living fashion, as indicated by the increase in the molecular weight with time and conversion and the relatively low polydispersity. The polymerization rate of St is so quick that the conversion reaches 70 % within 1 h at 125 degrees C when the molar ratio of MN to TEMPO is 4 : 1. Moreover, the reaction temperature can be reduced to 110 degrees C. A possible explanation for this effect is that the formation of hydrogen bonds between the MN and TEMPO moiety weakens the C-ON bond {{at the end of the}} polymer chain.

40|$|Aldol {{condensation}} {{of synthetic}} equivalents of acetacetic esters allows {{the formation of}} a polyfunctional C 5 fragment and the corresponding aldols have proven to be versatile key-intermediates in the synthesis of complex, biologically active natural products. O-silyldienolates 1 and 2 can be considered among the most popular masked acetacetic esters and in these last years the silyl dienolate 1 a (R 1 = R 2 = Me), deriving from commercially available 2, 2, 6 -trimethyl- 4 H- 1, 3 -dioxin- 4 -one, has been used in a variety of aldol reactions (based on the employment of Ti(IV), or Cu(II), chiral complexes) taking place with high efficiency and enantioselectivity; on the contrary, the highly oxygenated diene 2 (Chan’s diene) has been essentially used in the synthesis of racemic aldols by TiCl 4 catalysis. The aldol condensation of the synthetic equivalents of <b>acetoacetic</b> <b>ester</b> 1 - 2 can be conveniently performed {{in the presence of a}} chiral Ti(O-i-Pr) 4 /BINOL complex under catalytic conditions. The reported procedure is of particular synthetic value since the addition of masked acetoacetic esters proceeds efficiently with aromatic, heteroaromatic, a,b-unsaturated and aliphatic aldehydes too. In the course of the investigation on the mechanistic aspects of the reaction, positive non-linear effects have been observed; rather interestingly, the mode of preparation and the concentration of the catalyst has been found to exert a marked influence on the non linear effects.

40|$|Similarly to {{aldehydes}} [6] ketones form 3 -oxazolines via cycloaddition to the benzonitrile-methylides 2 {{that arise}} photochemically from the 3 -phenyl- 2 H-azirines 1. With various ketones benzonitrile-isopropylide (2 a) gives cycloaddition products {{in very good}} preparative yields (scheme 1). Benzonitrile-ethylide (2 c) and benzonitrile-benzylide (2 b) [8] react, however, sluggishly with ketones, smooth cycloaddition being observed in their case only with ‘activated’ ketones (2, 2, 2 -trifluoroacetophenone, 1, 1, 1 -trifluoro- 2 -propanone). With 1 a acetonylacetone forms the bis-adduct 12. While the azirine 1 a reacts with cyclohexanone to yield essentially only the spiro-(3 -oxazoline) 13, it gives with cyclopentanone, depending on the reaction conditions, either the spiro-(3 -oxazoline) 14 or the butenyl- 3 -oxazoline 15 (scheme 3). The formation of 15 has to be preceded by the photochemical formation of 4 -pentenal from the ketone. Norcamphor and camphor react {{in a similar way}} (schemes 4 and 5). The azirines 1 a–c react smoothly with the keto group in acylcyanides and alpha-keto-esters, giving with the former 5 -cyano- 3 -oxazolines and with the latter 5 -ethoxycarbonyl- 3 -oxazolines (schemes 6 and 7). Beta-keto-esters (<b>acetoacetic</b> <b>ester)</b> form with the dipole arising from 1 a the expected addition product 31 and, via the protonated dipole d (scheme 8), finally the benzylidene-acetoacetic ester.

The light-induced rearrangement of the bicyclic isoxazoline 37 into the oxazoline 38 is visualized as an intramolecular cycloaddition reaction (scheme 10).

The Claisen orthoester rearrangement of several systems derived from gamma,delta-unsaturated alpha-hydroxyphosphonates is described. The presence of the phosphoryl substituent appears to deactivate the Claisen system. A corresponding <b>acetoacetic</b> <b>ester</b> derivative failed to undergo a Carroll rearrangement. The [2, 3] sigmatropic rearrangement of allylic sulphenates derived from gamma,delta-unsaturated alpha-hydroxyphosphonates is described. The rearrangement of Claisen systems generated {{by the addition of}} allylic alcohols to diethyl (3 -methyl-buta- 1, 2 -dienyl) phosphonate is reported. Where the participating alcohol is allyl alcohol the two possible ketonic products of Claisen rearrangement are formed at room temperature. The ready rearrangement observed in this case is explained in terms of the reaction proceeding via the first-formed allylic anion intermediates rather than via the neutral adducts. An example of a Cope rearrangement involving the participation of an allenic phosphonate ester is described., The product of this rearrangement, a mixture of isomeric dienes, was converted into the corresponding Diels Alder adduct upon reaction with N-phenyl maleimide. The synthesis of a vinylallenic phosphonate with the potential to undergo an intramolecular ene reaction was achieved. Although the product of the ene reaction, a l, 3, 5 -hexatriene, was not isolated, species resulting from the cyclisation and aromatisation of this product were characterised. A modification to this system produced a vinylallenic phosphonate amenable to function as the diene fragment in a Diels Alder cycloaddition reaction.
