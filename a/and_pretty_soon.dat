500|$|However, {{the truth}} of the {{accounts}} has been disputed by some historians; in 1984, Malcolm Brown and Shirley Seaton concluded that there were probably attempts to play organised matches which failed due to the state of the ground, but that the contemporary reports were either hearsay or refer to [...] "kick-about" [...] matches with [...] "made-up footballs" [...] such as a bully-beef tin. Chris Baker, former chairman of The Western Front Association and author of The Truce: The Day the War Stopped is also sceptical, but says that although there is little hard evidence, the most likely place that an organised match could have taken place was near the village of Messines: [...] "There are two references to a game being played on the British side, but nothing from the Germans. If somebody one day found a letter from a German soldier who was in that area, then we would have something credible." [...] In fact, there is a German reference. Leutnant Kurt Zehmisch of Germany's 134th Saxons Infantry Regiment said that the English [...] "brought a soccer ball from their trenches, <b>and</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>soon</b> a lively game ensued. How marvelously wonderful, yet how strange it was". In 2011, Mike Dash concluded that [...] "there is plenty of evidence that football was played that Christmas Day—mostly by men of the same nationality, but in at least three or four places between troops from the opposing armies".|$|E
2500|$|.....the general alarms went off, and we {{were getting}} all the {{passengers}} out, getting everybody up on deck. It was blowing, the seas were starting to smack {{against the side of}} the ship, it was pitch black. <b>And</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>soon</b> we could see little bobbing lights along the shoreline, little oil lanterns so we obviously stirred up the natives. As it got lighter we could see that we had ripped out the bottom almost clear back to the engine room. There was a lot of oil, and it oiled the sea and the beach. There was no backing off, so we had to get the passengers ashore. We lowered the lifeboats with people in them.|$|E

2500|$|Spanbauer {{moved to}} New York City in 1983 {{and entered the}} Columbia University Writing Program. Spanbauer {{took a job as}} an {{apartment}} building supervisor in the East Village, and began abusing alcohol and taking cocaine. He began writing The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon in 1987, and by 1988 was deep into the manuscript. [...] The writing process was a very difficult one for Spanbauer. [...] He had so little money that he lived like [...] "a subway rat, pale and frail, trying hard to believe in" [...] the novel he was writing. He later said, [...] "A lot of the stuff I came up with was pretty fearsome, facing some personal devils head-on. I couldn't distinguish between the world and the book. At one point, I was so stressed out, I passed out in Penn Station." [...] As he told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer after the book's publication, [...] "It's all a matter of trust. You're {{right in the middle of}} this story. [...] You don't know the end of it. It's this preposterous tale about these preposterous people, and you don't know what's going to happen next, and you're tired of eating chicken livers and fettuccine, and you're alone in this little square concrete apartment, there's no air or earth, <b>and</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>soon</b> it was hard for me to distinguish what was going on in my head and what was going on on the outside." [...] The book took four and a half years and seven revisions to complete.|$|E

YTMND was again mentioned in the magazine in June 2006 when a link to timetraveler.ytmnd.com was printed. In May, Current TV host and producer Max Lugavere was spotted wearing a YTMND T-shirt on the network. In the August 2006 issue of WIRED, an article under the [...] "Expert" [...] column by the name of [...] "1 Web Site, 250,000 Idiotic Clips. LOL!" [...] was printed. In the article, five of Goldberg's favorite YTMNDs (You're the Man Now, Dog; Vader Coaster; Lohan Facial; LOL Internet; Blue Ball Machine) were mentioned, along with commentary from Max himself for each one. [...] The article's writer, James Lee, can be quoted as saying [...] "Repeat an image loop and a sound file – as 24-year-old Max Goldberg with You're the Man Now, Dog – <b>and</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>soon</b> you'll have 4 million visitors a month and 120,000 contributors uploading their own clips."

60|$|Then {{she began}} to plunge into the snow {{this way and that}} way, <b>and</b> sure enough, <b>pretty</b> <b>soon</b> she landed so close to Danny Meadow Mouse that one of her claws {{scratched}} him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, give me that," [...] said Arthur, {{with the}} peevishness of {{physical}} depression. When {{he had taken}} some sips, Adam said, [...] "Hadn't I better run to th' house, sir, and get some more brandy?

6000|$|He {{never said}} nothing. But he sighed, <b>and</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>soon</b> he stopped digging, {{and then for}} a good little while I knowed that he was thinking. Then he says: ...|$|E

60|$|Now Peter Rabbit {{is really}} one of the best-hearted little fellows in the world, just happy-go-lucky and careless.

50|$|The grammar is minimal, so {{children}} can start using it actively (in speaking <b>and</b> writing) <b>pretty</b> <b>soon.</b> This {{allows them to}} keep their initial enthusiasm that is usually lost after the first encounter with a foreign language {{that needs to be}} studied for many years before being able to express mere basic sentences.

6000|$|It was {{carbolic}} acid. He had a carboy of it. He sprinkled it {{all around}} everywhere; {{in fact he}} drenched everything with it, rifle-box, cheese and all.

60|$|All Danny Meadow Mouse {{could think}} about was his short tail.
