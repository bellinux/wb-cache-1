5|$|Dinheirosaurus {{material}} included vertebrae, ribs, partial pelvis, and gastroliths.

Other vertebral material includes seven centra that are fragmentary and a few neural arches, which are unattached. 12 dorsal ribs are preserved, {{as well as some}} appendicular elements. David Weishampel et al. did not recognize all the material as belonging to Dinheirosaurus, and only found 9 dorsals in the holotype, while also misinterpreting the pubis as a limb fragment. They also incorrectly stated that it was found in the Camadas de Alcobaça Formation. Another pair of vertebrae, under collection number ML 418, was originally assigned to Dinheirosaurus by Bonaparte and Mateus, but is now considered to be a distinct new unnamed genus of diplodocid.|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} most ulnar head {{implants}} is currently {{not based on}} studies of anatomical variations. To enable prosthesis design based on anatomical features, a method is developed {{for the detection of}} the ulna surface that <b>articulates</b> with the radius head. The <b>articulating</b> surface is detected by combining partial <b>articulating</b> ulna surfaces detected in CT scans of different individuals in different poses. Correspondences between ulnae of different individuals are established through the construction of a statistical shape model (SSM) of the ulna head. The <b>articulating</b> surface is attached to this SSM, allowing the detection of <b>articulating</b> surfaces in ulnae that are not in the training set of the model. As a simple shape is desirable for prosthesis design, three quadratic surfaces were fitted to the <b>articulating</b> surfaces of 40 ulnae. The mean fitting error for the simplest surface, a cylinder, was 0. 20 mm. As this error is smaller than the voxel size of 0. 3 mm isotropic, it was concluded that the <b>articulating</b> ulna surface can be satisfactory approximated by a cylinder part...|$|R

5|$|Typically for a stegosaur, Kentrosaurus had {{extensive}} osteoderm (bony {{structures in the}} skin) covering, including small plates (probably located on the neck and anterior trunk), and spikes of various shapes. The spikes of Kentrosaurus are very elongated, with one specimen having a bone core length of 731 millimetres. The plates have a thickened section in the middle, {{as if they were}} modified spines. The spikes and plates were likely covered by horn. Aside from a few exceptions they were not found in close association with other skeletal remains. Thus, the exact position of most osteoderms is uncertain. A pair of closely spaced spikes was found <b>articulated</b> with a tail tip, and a number of spikes were found apparently regularly spaced in pairs along the path of an <b>articulated</b> tail.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{so-called}} {{gold standard}} for treatment of periprosthetic joint infection following total knee arthroplasty is two-stage reimplantation. However, {{it is unclear whether}} use of static or <b>articulating</b> antibiotic-impregnated spacers during the interim period between these two stages is superior. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the outcomes of static and <b>articulating</b> spacers in the treatment of infection following total knee arthroplasty. Methods: A systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature indexed byMEDLINE and Embase was performed to identify studies reporting the outcomes of antibiotic spacers in the treatment of infection following total knee arthroplasty. Seven Level-III comparative studies and thirty-two Level-IV case series remained following the screening process. The data in these studies were extracted and aggregated to compare the reinfection rate, range of knee motion, functional scores, and complication rates between static and <b>articulating</b> spacers. Results: The two types of spacers demonstrated similar reinfection rates (7 % for <b>articulating</b> and 12 % for static, p = 0. 2). However, the <b>articulating</b> spacers resulted in significantly greater range of knee motion after reimplantation (101 for <b>articulating</b> and 91 for static, p = 0. 0002). Despite this difference in ultimate kneemotion, functional scores in the treatment groups were similar. Rates of wound-related and spacer-related complications were similarly low with both types of spacers. Conclusions: Our review failed to identify a significant difference in the ability of static or <b>articulating</b> spacers to eradicate periprosthetic infection following total knee arthroplasty. Compared with static spacers, <b>articulating</b> spacers provide...|$|R
