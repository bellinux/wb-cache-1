5|$|Goldman pursued an {{independent}} education on her own, however, and {{soon began to}} study the political turmoil around her, particularly the Nihilists responsible for assassinating Alexander II of Russia. The ensuing turmoil intrigued Goldman, although she did not fully understand it at the time. When she read Chernyshevsky's novel, What Is to Be Done? (1863), she found <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>model</b> in the protagonist Vera, who adopts a Nihilist philosophy and escapes her repressive family to live freely and organize a sewing cooperative.

5|$|In 766 Æthelbert succeeded Ecgbert as archbishop; he was consecrated 24 April 767, {{the feast}} {{day of his}} {{predecessor}} Wilfrid. This may have been deliberate and a sign that Æthelbert wished to revive Wilfrid's ambitions for the archiepiscopal see. Æthelbert received his pallium from Pope Adrian I in 773. Alcuin was appointed head of the cathedral school after Æthelbert became archbishop. Much of Alcuin's description of Æthelbert's time as archbishop has the flavour of a panegyric, as Alcuin praised Æthelbert as a model bishop suitable for other bishops to use as <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>model.</b>|$|E

5|$|In the mid-2000s, Boisselier often {{taught about}} the Raëlian {{perspective}} {{of the body and}} sexuality. She discussed these topics from a biological perspective, arguing that humans are essentially robots because they can be reprogrammed. Specifically, she maintained that hormones program the brain, and they provide humans with the freedom to choose from many possibilities. Raëlians emphasize sexual stimulation as a way to positively change their members, and Boisselier has stated that she sees the pursuit of femininity as a method of spiritual growth. The group highly values feminine beauty, and Raël has applauded Boisselier for maintaining her appearance, casting her as <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>model.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jack is {{the first}} openly non-heterosexual {{character}} {{in the history of}} televised Doctor Who. The popularity of the character amongst multiple audiences directly influenced the development of the spin-off series Torchwood.

As an ongoing depiction of bisexuality in mainstream British television, the character became <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>model</b> for young gay and bisexual people in the UK. Jack is featured in various Doctor Who and Torchwood books and has action figures created in his likeness.|$|E
5|$|Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 is {{the fourth}} studio album by American singer Janet Jackson, {{released}} on September 19, 1989, by A Records. Although label executives wanted material similar to her previous album, Control (1986), Jackson insisted on creating a concept album addressing social issues. Collaborating with songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, she drew inspiration from various tragedies reported through news media, exploring racism, poverty, and substance abuse, in addition to themes of romance. Although its primary concept was met with mixed reactions, its composition received critical acclaim. Jackson came to be considered <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>model</b> for youth because of her socially conscious lyrics.|$|E

Jenner is an executive producer of the show. The show focuses on Jenner's transition and how it affects her relationships with her family and friends.

In October 2015, the show was renewed for a second season, which premiered on March 6, 2016. The show tied for best Outstanding Reality Program at the GLAAD Media Awards in 2016.|$|E

Her mother {{died when she was}} twelve years old, and her father married an ear and throat specialist, who provided Kay with <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>model</b> of a career woman.|$|E
5|$|As {{his sons}} had desired and planned, Wilberforce {{has long been}} viewed as a Christian hero, a statesman-saint held up as <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>model</b> for putting his faith into action. More broadly, {{he has also been}} {{described}} as a humanitarian reformer who contributed significantly to reshaping the political and social attitudes of the time by promoting concepts of social responsibility and action. In the 1940s, the role of Wilberforce and the Clapham Sect in abolition was downplayed by historian Eric Williams, who argued that abolition was motivated not by humanitarianism but by economics, as the West Indian sugar industry was in decline. Williams' approach strongly influenced historians for much of {{the latter part of the}} 20th century. However, more recent historians have noted that the sugar industry was still making large profits at the time of abolition, and this has led to a renewed interest in Wilberforce and the Evangelicals, as well as a recognition of the anti-slavery movement as a prototype for subsequent humanitarian campaigns.|$|E

5|$|Comfort, however, {{asserts that}} McClintock was well {{regarded}} by her professional peers, {{even in the}} early years of her career. Although Comfort argues that McClintock was not a victim of gender discrimination, she has been widely written about in the context of women's studies. Most recent biographical works on women in science feature accounts of her experience. She is held up as <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>model</b> for girls in such works of children's literature as Edith Hope Fine's Barbara McClintock, Nobel Prize Geneticist, Deborah Heiligman's Barbara McClintock: Alone in Her Field and Mary Kittredge's Barbara McClintock. A recent biography for young adults by Naomi Pasachoff, Barbara McClintock, Genius of Genetics, provides a new perspective, based on the current literature.|$|E
5|$|For most of George's regency and reign, Lord Liverpool {{controlled}} {{the government as}} Prime Minister, with little help from George. His ministers found his behaviour selfish, unreliable and irresponsible. At all times he was much {{under the influence of}} favourites. Taxpayers were angry at his wasteful spending at a time when Britons were fighting in the Napoleonic Wars. He did not provide national leadership in time of crisis, nor act as <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>model</b> for his people. Liverpool's government presided over Britain's ultimate victory, negotiated the peace settlement, and attempted to deal with the social and economic malaise that followed. After Liverpool's retirement, George was forced to accept Catholic emancipation despite opposing it. His only legitimate child, Princess Charlotte, died before him in 1817 and so he was succeeded by his younger brother, William.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, American {{director}} George Lucas had released Star Wars, {{a wildly}} successful science fiction film influenced by Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress, among other works. Lucas, {{like many other}} New Hollywood directors, revered Kurosawa and considered him <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>model,</b> and was shocked {{to discover that the}} Japanese filmmaker was unable to secure financing for any new work. The two met in San Francisco in July 1978 to discuss the project Kurosawa considered most financially viable: Kagemusha, the epic story of a thief hired as the double of a medieval Japanese lord of a great clan. Lucas, enthralled by the screenplay and Kurosawa's illustrations, leveraged his influence over 20th Century Fox to coerce the studio that had fired Kurosawa just ten years earlier to produce Kagemusha, then recruited fellow fan Francis Ford Coppola as co-producer.|$|E
