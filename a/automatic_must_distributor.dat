25|$|In {{cases where}} the {{temporary}} service is not completed within the stipulated time period, an <b>automatic</b> extension <b>must</b> be requested from the Immigration Department. The automatic extension will be granted in order to enable the CARICOM National to complete the service once the service provider submits proof that the service is not yet completed.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes a data {{distributor}} gives {{sensitive data}} {{to one or}} more third parties. Some time later, some of the data is found in an unauthorized place (e.g., on the web or on a user's laptop). The <b>distributor</b> <b>must</b> then investigate the source of the leak.|$|R
2500|$|Twelve {{points on}} the licence within three years makes the driver liable to {{disqualification}} under the [...] "totting-up" [...] procedure; however this is not <b>automatic</b> and <b>must</b> be decided on by a court of law. Endorsements remain on the licence for four years, rather than three, to ensure that offences are not removed while still legally applicable.|$|R
5000|$|All <b>automatic</b> wins <b>MUST</b> be {{declared}} {{before the first}} card is drawn for game play, otherwise the win is forfeited and the game continues as normal. All automatic wins are valid if the terms are met either {{before or after the}} [...] "Cambio". Ace is always considered the highest card for deciding upon multiple automatic wins.|$|R

50|$|Among other regulations, all Canadian {{broadcasters}} and <b>distributors</b> <b>must</b> be {{at least}} 80% owned and controlled by Canadian citizens; also, all conventional stations, and most established specialty services, are required to air a majority of Canadian content, both throughout its schedule and in its primetime schedule.|$|R
5000|$|Distributors - face {{a complex}} {{environment}} that often includes thousands of individual SKUs with several different product lifecycles. Each <b>distributor</b> <b>must</b> account for {{factors such as}} channel conflict, cross-product cannibalization, and competitive actions. Revenue Management has proved useful to distributors in promotion analysis and negotiated contracts.|$|R
25|$|Following an {{activation}} incident, {{both the}} blade and braking cartridge must be replaced. The <b>automatic</b> braking feature <b>must</b> be bypassed when cutting conductive material, such as wet timber.|$|R
25|$|China has {{concluded}} reciprocal visa facilitation agreements on a reciprocal basis {{with the following}} countries, and nationals covered by the agreements can have their application fees waived or reduced, or be issued long-term, multiple-entry Chinese visas at the same cost as the single-entry visas. The issuance of multiple-entry visas, however, is not <b>automatic</b> and <b>must</b> be voluntarily requested by the applicant.|$|R
50|$|Category C news {{channels}} {{are subject to}} a form of must carry rules; they must be offered on a packaged or standalone basis, but not necessarily on the lowest tier of service, by all digital television providers. Category C sports services are not subject to must-carry rules; <b>distributors</b> <b>must</b> negotiate directly with their operators for carriage.|$|R
40|$|In the Inventory Routing Problem, a <b>distributor</b> <b>must</b> {{choose the}} size and {{frequency}} of deliveries to each of its customers and design vehicle routes {{so as to avoid}} stockouts over a given planning horizon. We propose a tabu search heuristic for the deterministic version of this problem. Computational results are reported on randomly generated test problems. ...|$|R
50|$|Mary Kay sells {{cosmetics}} {{through a}} multi-level marketing model. Mary Kay distributors (called beauty consultants) can potentially make income by directly selling {{to people in}} their community, and also receive a commission on wholesale purchases made by people they recruit into the distribution network. Mary Kay <b>distributors</b> <b>must</b> purchase a $100 starter kit in order to qualify.|$|R
5000|$|A {{producer}} {{must provide}} appropriate {{information to consumers}} (art.7). Either a producer or <b>distributor</b> <b>must</b> inform an enforcement authority if they become aware that they have supplied a dangerous product (reg.9). The authority must inform the Secretary of State, [...] the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, who must inform the European Commission (regs.33-34) ...|$|R
50|$|Starting June 1, 2009, the FDA {{will require}} all OTC {{companies}} and Veterinary Medicines (Vet Med) manufacturers {{to submit their}} product labeling {{in compliance with the}} SPL standards. Additionally, all companies that produce Pharmaceutical (Rx), Over-the-Counter (OTC), Biologics products, Veterinary medicines, and <b>distributors</b> <b>must</b> provide FDA with all registration listing and drug listings in the SPL electronic format.|$|R
5000|$|According to the {{teaching}} of the Catholic Church, to receive the fruits of the sacraments requires that a person be properly disposed. This means the efficacy of grace via the sacraments is not <b>automatic.</b> There <b>must</b> be, at least {{in the case of an}} adult, an openness to use the sufficient grace which is available in a sacrament. When the recipient is properly disposed, [...] "the sacraments are instrumental causes of grace." ...|$|R
25|$|The CRTC's {{simultaneous}} substitution rules {{require that}} when a Canadian network licences a television show from a US network and shows {{it in the same}} time slot, upon request by the Canadian broadcaster, Canadian broadcast <b>distributors</b> <b>must</b> replace the show on the US channel with the broadcast of the Canadian channel, along with any overlays and commercials. As Grey's Anatomy is on ABC, but is carried in Canada on CTV at the same time, for instance, the cable, satellite, or other broadcast <b>distributor</b> <b>must</b> send the CTV feed over the signal of the carried ABC affiliate, even where the ABC version is somehow different, particularly commercials. (These rules are not intended to apply in case of differing episodes of the same series; this difference may not always be communicated to distributors, although this is rather rare.) Viewers via home antenna who receive both American and Canadian networks on their personal sets are not affected by sim-sub.|$|R
50|$|Employers {{are allowed}} to {{automatically}} enroll their employees in 401(k) plans, requiring employees to actively opt out {{if they do not}} want to participate (traditionally, 401(k)s required employees to opt in). Companies offering such <b>automatic</b> 401(k)s <b>must</b> choose a default investment fund and savings rate. Employees who are enrolled automatically will become investors in the default fund at the default rate, although they may select different funds and rates if they choose, or even opt out completely.|$|R
40|$|Estimates of the {{effectiveness}} of a model following type control system in reducing the roll excursion due to a wake vortex encounter were obtained from single degree of freedom computations with inputs derived from the results of wind tunnel, flight, and simulation experiments. The analysis indicates that the control power commanded by the <b>automatic</b> system <b>must</b> be roughly equal to the vortex induced roll acceleration if effective limiting of the maximum bank angle is to be achieved...|$|R
40|$|Reservoir {{simulation}} results are typically visualized using a post-processing model, where the dataset is first created from numerical simulations, and then {{used as input}} to a visualization system for graphical output and interaction. There are no interactions with simulation parameters and/or images generated during the simulation execution. The main advantage of this model is that the data can be examined repeatedly using different mapping techniques. In particular, we are focusing on developing hybrid (interactive-automatic) exploratory methods to assist the reservoir engineer on well manipulation and re-configuration from reservoir post-processing data for subsequent fine-tuning of new simulation runs. These tools allow more intuitive construction and manipulation of new and/or existing wells and visual analysis of uncertainty ranges for both geological and flow simulation properties. Introduction & Method The unique challenges of time-varying reservoir visualization are the very dynamic behaviours of the data, the many complex interactions among the reservoir properties, variables, and structures, and the increasing size of observational and simulation datasets. It {{is often difficult to}} identify the processes that matter most for a particular reservoir phenomenon. Hybrid tools (i. e. interactive and <b>automatic)</b> <b>must</b> b...|$|R
5000|$|In July 2006 the LADR/Prover9/Mace4 input {{language}} {{made a major}} change (which also differentiates it from Otter). The key distinction between [...] "clauses" [...] and [...] "formulas" [...] completely disappeared; [...] "formulas" [...] can now have free variables; and [...] "clauses" [...] are now a subset of [...] "formulas". Prover9/Mace4 also supports a [...] "goal" [...] type of formula, which is automatically negated for proof. Prover9 attempts to automatically generate a proof by default; in contrast, Otter's <b>automatic</b> mode <b>must</b> be explicitly set.|$|R
50|$|Under {{the terms}} of the 1984 Video Recordings Act all {{non-exempt}} videos sold or distributed within the UK must be given a certificate by the BBFC. The <b>distributor</b> <b>must</b> decide whether a video is exempt. Uncertificated recordings are not illegal, regardless of content (except where the content itself is illegal), but supply (i.e. sale, rental, loan or gift) of them is. The R18 certificate is the most restrictive of the certificates.|$|R
50|$|The 2009 Brazilian Federal Law 11.903 and {{subsequent}} regulations of the National Agency for Sanitary Surveillance in Brazil (ANVISA) require that a 2D data matrix code {{be put on}} all secondary packaging. Under these provisions, manufacturers {{will be required to}} maintain a database of all transactions from manufacturing to dispensing, while <b>distributors</b> <b>must</b> report serialized transaction data to the manufacturer and keep a database of suppliers, medicine recipients, and packing companies.|$|R
50|$|Banerjee et al. (2005) {{highlight}} five {{attributes that}} a good <b>automatic</b> metric <b>must</b> possess; correlation, sensitivity, consistency, reliability and generality. Any good metric must correlate highly with human judgment, it must be consistent, giving similar results to the same MT system on similar text. It must be sensitive to differences between MT systems and reliable in that MT systems that score similarly {{should be expected to}} perform similarly. Finally, the metric must be general, that is it should work with different text domains, {{in a wide range of}} scenarios and MT tasks.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Due to the {{explosive}} growth of electronically stored information, <b>automatic</b> methods <b>must</b> be developed to aid users in maintaining and using this abundance of information effectively. In particular, {{the sheer volume of}} redundancy present must be dealt with, leaving only the information-rich data to be processed. This paper presents an approach, based on an integrated use of fuzzy-rough sets and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), to greatly reduce this data redundancy. The work is applied to the problem of webpage categorization, considerably reducing dimensionality with minimal loss of information. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{cases where}} the {{temporary}} service is not completed within the stipulated time period, an <b>automatic</b> extension <b>must</b> be requested from the Immigration Department. The automatic extension will be granted in order to enable the CARICOM National to complete the service once the service provider submits proof that the service is not yet completed. The automatic extension is based on rights enshrined in the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas, namely non-discrimination (national treatment) {{and the right to}} provide a service through mode 4 - the movement of national persons.|$|R
50|$|Whether {{imperial}} or not, {{the inheritance}} or creation was never <b>automatic,</b> and <b>must</b> be approved {{either by the}} Emperor, the Ministry of Personnel, or the Imperial Clan Court. Imperial princes, upon reaching adulthood {{at the age of}} 20, must pass tests in horse-riding, archery and the Manchu language before they were eligible for titles. Imperial princesses, other than the Emperor's daughters, were usually granted titles upon marriage, regardless of age. Princesses' titles were also usually fixed after they were granted, and were not affected by changes in their fathers' nobility ranks.|$|R
25|$|The CRTC also regulates which {{channels}} broadcast <b>distributors</b> <b>must</b> or may offer. Per the Broadcasting Act {{the commission}} also gives priority to Canadian signals—many non-Canadian channels which compete with Canadian channels are thus not approved for distribution in Canada. The CRTC argues that allowing free trade in television stations would overwhelm the smaller Canadian market, preventing it from upholding its responsibility {{to foster a}} national conversation. Some people, however, consider this tantamount to censorship.|$|R
50|$|Hercules runs under {{multiple}} parent {{operating systems}} including GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows, FreeBSD, Solaris, and Mac OS X and is released under the {{open source software}} license QPL. It is analogous to Bochs and QEMU in that it emulates CPU instructions and select peripheral devices only. A vendor (or <b>distributor)</b> <b>must</b> still provide an operating system, and the user must install it. Hercules was notably the first mainframe emulator to incorporate 64-bit z/Architecture support, beating out commercial offerings.|$|R
