5|$|Joyce {{had begun}} his {{education}} at Clongowes Wood College, <b>a</b> <b>Jesuit</b> boarding school near Clane, County Kildare, in 1888 {{but had to}} leave in 1892 when his father could no longer pay the fees. Joyce then studied at home and briefly at the Christian Brothers O'Connell School on North Richmond Street, Dublin, before he was offered {{a place in the}} Jesuits' Dublin school, Belvedere College, in 1893. This came about because of a chance meeting his father had with <b>a</b> <b>Jesuit</b> priest who knew the family and Joyce was given a reduction in fees to attend Belvedere. In 1895, Joyce, now aged 13, was elected to join the Sodality of Our Lady by his peers at Belvedere.

Shortly after this, possibly due to the death of his fiancée, he joined a French regiment in Canada engaged in the French and Indian War (1754–1763). After being wounded in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham (1759), Crèvecœur resigned his commission and began traveling widely across Pennsylvania and New York.|$|E

Young O'Connell attended Belvedere College, <b>a</b> <b>Jesuit</b> school in Dublin, but was called home at the deaths of his mother and sister in a coach accident. This tragic event was later judged to be the source of O'Connell's sense of the impermanence of the world. After the funeral, he was transferred without enthusiasm to Clongowes Wood College where he studied the classics for three years. O'Connell signed on with the Royal Navy as a midshipman. He travelled around Cape Horn to California in 1868.|$|E

5|$|The Old Debauchees, {{originally}} titled The Despairing Debauchee, {{appeared with}} The Covent-Garden Tragedy on 1 June 1732.

The play alludes to the 1731 trial of Father Girard, <b>a</b> <b>Jesuit</b> tried for using magic during an attempted seduction/rape of a young girl.

He then enlisted in the United States Air Force, where he ultimately became head of the Policy Branch of the USAF Psychological Warfare Division.|$|E
