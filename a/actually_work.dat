After Keith tells Dean O’Dell {{that his wife}} is {{cheating}} on him with Veronica’s criminology professor, {{he pulls out a}} gun. Wallace and Piz find a drink that was tested positive for GHB, and Wallace and Piz dash to her dorm. Dean O’Dell finds and enters into the room in which his wife and the criminology professor are carrying on their affair as Veronica learns that they have tracked the wrong girl. Just as Mercer (Ryan Devlin) (the actual rapist) is about to rape his next victim, he abruptly learns that Veronica has changed places with his victim. Veronica tases Mercer, and they have a quick fight before Veronica escapes. She is let into Moe’s (Andrew McClain) room.|$|E
5|$|Recently it {{has been}} {{questioned}} whether a royal affinity could <b>actually</b> <b>work</b> {{in the same way}} as a noble one. It has been suggested that since the king had to be a lord to his retainers and provide good lordship, but also king to the entire people, a contradiction existed, resulting in a decline in local stability where this occurred. At the same time, even powerful magnates such as Gaunt could cause local dissatisfaction by retaining some and, inevitably, excluding others. On the other hand, it has also been pointed out how, particularly for kings, recruitment into the affinity was a clear promotion which could act as an encouraging loyalty or offered a political amnesty.|$|E

25|$|Education {{outcomes}} {{can lead}} to a constrained nature of teaching and assessment. Assessing liberal outcomes such as creativity, respect for self and others, responsibility, and self-sufficiency, can become problematic. There is not a measurable, observable, or specific way to determine if a student has achieved these outcomes. Due to the nature of specific outcomes, OBE may <b>actually</b> <b>work</b> against its ideals of serving and creating individuals that have achieved many outcomes.|$|E

For example, to use AAPT to call a number in Tokyo, Japan, subscribers would dial 1414 0011 81 3 xxxx xxxx, or to use Optus to call a Perth they would dial 1456 08 xxxx xxxx.

25|$|Angiogenesis {{research}} is a cutting-edge field in cancer research, and recent evidence also suggests traditional therapies, such as radiation therapy, may <b>actually</b> <b>work</b> {{in part by}} targeting the genomically stable endothelial cell compartment, rather than the genomically unstable tumor cell compartment. New blood vessel formation is a relatively fragile process, subject to disruptive interference at several levels. In short, the therapy is the selection agent which {{is being used to}} kill a cell compartment. Tumor cells evolve resistance rapidly due to rapid generation time (days) and genomic instability (variation), whereas endothelial cells are a good target because of a long generation time (months) and genomic stability (low variation).|$|E

25|$|Both the Siegel {{estate and}} Time Warner have appealed Larson's ruling. The Siegel estate claims the judge erred by finding {{most of the}} Superman {{material}} written by Siegel from 1938 through 1943 to be work for hire. Time Warner asserts the Siegel estate had agreed to a settlement that precludes termination, and that the material awarded to the Siegel estate by Judge Larson was <b>actually</b> <b>work</b> for hire. Oral argument was held on November 5, 2012, in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

500|$|In {{the season}} eight episode [...] "Homer's Enemy" [...] the writers decided to examine [...] "what {{it would be}} like to <b>actually</b> <b>work</b> {{alongside}} Homer Simpson". The episode explores the possibilities of a realistic character with a strong work ethic named Frank Grimes placed alongside Homer in a work environment. In the episode, Homer is portrayed as an everyman and the embodiment of the American spirit; however, in some scenes his negative characteristics and silliness are prominently highlighted. By the end of the episode, Grimes, a hard working and persevering [...] "real American hero", has become the villain; the viewer is intended to be pleased that Homer has emerged victorious.|$|E

The kids news with Bart and Lisa: I mean, you see them do really stupid stories about the news, and 'news you can use,' and 'how to get rid of your sheets when you wet them.' I mean, people really do stories like that." [...] Steven Keslowitz writes in his book The World According to the Simpsons that the episode showcases the fact that [...] "the viewing of attractive newscasters and the use of persuasive tones of voice often do {{have an impact on the}} minds of many intelligent members of American society." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{was some}} {{controversy}} over Bird's endorsement {{of a machine}} invented by one I. L. Pulvermacher that became known as Pulvermacher's chain. [...] The main market for this device was the very quack practitioners that Bird so detested, but it did <b>actually</b> <b>work</b> as a generator. [...] Bird was given a sample of this machine in 1851 and was impressed enough to give Pulvermacher a testimonial stating that the machine was a useful source of electricity. [...] Bird thought {{that it could be}} used by physicians as a portable device. [...] Electrically, the machine worked like a voltaic pile, but was constructed differently. [...] It consisted of a number of wooden dowels, each with a bifilar winding of copper and zinc coils. [...] Each winding was connected to the next dowel by means of metal hooks and eyes, which also provided the electrical connection. [...] The electrolyte was provided by soaking the dowels in vinegar.Lardner, pp. 288–289 ...|$|E

500|$|... "Marry Me a Little, Marry Me a Little More" [...] {{was written}} by Jeff Greenstein and Bill Wrubel and was {{directed}} by series producer James Burrows. It was the one-hundredth episode of Will & Grace, and the producers celebrated the milestone by planning an hour-long episode followed by a clip show featuring highlights and outtakes from past seasons. In an interview with The Jewish Journal in 2001, David Kohan, the co-creator of Will & Grace, in discussing the lead characters, stated that a marriage {{could be a problem}} for the dynamic between the two characters: [...] "I'd love for [...] to find a Jewish love interest, but that relationship might <b>actually</b> <b>work,</b> and then there'd be no more 'Will & Grace'." [...] Kohan, however, changed his mind by the time of a follow-up interview in 2002: he noted that the characters had to [...] "move on forward in their lives in some way" [...] and it would be unlikely that Grace's possible husband would displace her gay best friend, Will. In July 2002, reports surfaced that a possible wedding involving Grace would happen, but the staff were not allowed to reveal anything.|$|E
500|$|In {{this chapter}} Beddard {{discusses}} the warning coloration (aposematism) of animals, which he notes [...] "have a precisely opposite tendency" [...] to camouflage, [...] "viz., to render their possessor conspicuous". He at once {{says that the}} explanation was [...] "first devised by Mr. Wallace" [...] for insects. The chapter therefore begins with the insects, often using English species as examples. He examines critically whether eye-like markings and other warnings <b>actually</b> <b>work.</b> He discusses experiments by Poulton on the elephant hawk-moth, where a Sand lizard is only briefly startled, and his own at the London zoo using a range of predators and different insects. Beddard is only partially convinced, flirting with Dr. Eisig's theory that the pigments creating the colours of caterpillars are inherently distasteful, and hence that [...] "the brilliant colours (i.e. the abundant secretion of pigment) have caused the inedibility of the species, rather than that the inedibility has necessitated the production of bright colours as an advertisement." [...] So Beddard suggests that [...] "the advent of bird-life proved a disastrous event for these animals, and compelled them to undergo various modifications", except when they were already by luck warning coloured and distasteful.|$|E
500|$|Lucas {{decided to}} make {{elaborate}} costumes because the film's society was more sophisticated than the one depicted in the original trilogy. Designer Trisha Biggar and her team created over 1,000 costumes that were inspired by various cultures. Biggar worked closely with concept designer Iain McCaig to create a color palette for the inhabitants of each world: Tatooine followed A New Hope with sun-bleached sand colors, Coruscant had grays, browns and blacks, and Naboo had green and gold for humans while Gungans wore [...] "a leathery look, like their skin". The Jedi costumes followed the tradition from the original film; Obi-Wan's costume {{was inspired by the}} costume that was worn by Guinness. Lucas said he and Biggar would look at the conceptual art to [...] "translat all of these designs into cloth and fabric and materials that would <b>actually</b> <b>work</b> and not look silly". Biggar also consulted Gillard to ensure the costumes would accommodate action scenes, [...] and consulted the creature department to find which fabrics [...] "wouldn't wear too heavily" [...] on the alien skins. A huge wardrobe department was set up at Leavesden Film Studios to create over 250 costumes for the main actors and 5,000 for the background ones.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Marge surprises Lisa {{by sending}} {{her to a}} {{performing}} arts camp for a week. She eagerly immerses herself there in music and theater, meeting several campers who love to break into song and two guitar-playing hipster counselors, Ethan and Kurt. When Marge takes her {{home at the end}} of the week, Lisa has trouble readjusting to normal life and looks for a chance to express her newly awakened creative side. She runs away from home and seeks out Ethan and Kurt in [...] "Sprooklyn", described by the counselors as the [...] "artistic hotbed of Springfield". However, she soon learns that they have grossly exaggerated the area, which is really a run-down slum, and that they <b>actually</b> <b>work</b> at a sandwich shop. They sing a song about the difficulties of being an artist, during which Krusty gets beaten up for accidentally announcing he is the prison snitch. Ethan and Kurt encourage her to return to her family and think about trying to make an artistic name for herself when she is older. As Marge arrives to take Lisa home, Ethan and Kurt show off a mural that they have painted in her honor, which takes up an entire side of a building.|$|E

The 's operating memory (LPDDR2-1066 eDRAM) was doubled, from 512 MB to 1 GB. Storage capacities available are fixed at 16, 32 or 64 GB, {{the same as the}} 4S; plug-in memory cards are not supported. The two color options are black (with black glass and slate-colored metal trim), and white (with white ceramic and silver-colored metal trim); again the same color options (though differently implemented) as its predecessor the 4S had. The iPhone 5 retains the 8 megapixel back camera on the iPhone 4S, but has improved low-light performance, and has a 40% faster photo capture than its predecessors, while having a purple hue when a strong source of light is present in the photograph. The front camera, which is accessible through the FaceTime and camera app has a lower resolution, at 1.2 megapixels. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery with a charge capacity of 1440mAh is built in and cannot be replaced by the user; it is rated at ≤225hours of standby time and ≤8hours of talk time.
