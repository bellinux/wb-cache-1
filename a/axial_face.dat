40|$|Wildhaber-Novikov gears are {{becoming}} more and more popular for heavy load applications. They have been tried as speed-reducing gears, in spite of heavy noise generation, in aircraft jet engines, marine engines and agricultural machinery. These circular-arc gears, though stronger than involute geras, have the disadvantage of needing larger face width. <b>Axial</b> <b>face</b> width required can be minimized only at the expense of load-carrying capacity. This is not a serious disadvantage with stationary engines. But in the case of automotive applications, this fact limits the load-carrying capacity of Wildhaber-Novikov gears, since space problem is very critical in these applications and large face widths, therefore, cannot be used for such gear-reduction units. The face width is determined by the helix angle and, therefore, a thorough investigation of the dependence of the load-carrying capacity on helix angle is necessary, if these special types of gears have to make headway into the automotive field. In this experimental investigation, three-dimensional photoelastic technique has been employed to study the load-carrying capacity/face width ratio. Three-dimensional gear models made of epoxy castings (Araldite B) were loaded in a specially built gear-loading fixture and were stress frozen. Gear cutters of Wildhaber-Novikov gears developed at the laboratory were used for the preparation of these three-dimensional gear models. The stress-frozen models were analyzed using the conventional slicing technique to study the contact and bending-stress distribution along the face width. The load-carrying capacity in terms of contact stress and bending stress has been studied for different face widths and helix angles. Twenty-deg pressure angle, 14 -mm module gears of alladdendum type of Wildhaber-Novikov gears with different helix angles up to 40 deg were tested. The helical-overlap ratio used was 1. 0. The conventional profile parameters were employed for the manufacture of gear cutters of end-mill type. The decrease in contact and bending strength with increase in the helix angle or decrease in the face width, as obtained from this photoelastic method of stress analysis has been compared with existing theoretical results. © 1977 Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc...|$|E
40|$|A unique {{configuration}} of the P&W SSME Alternate Fuel Turbopump turbine disk/blade assembly, combined with a severe thermal environment, resulted in several structural anomalies that were driven by frictional contact forces. Understanding the mechanics of these problems provides new quality checks for future turbo machinery designs. During development testing in 1997 of the SSME alternate fuel turbopump at Stennis Space Center, several potentially serious problems surfaced with the turbine disk/blade assembly {{that had not been}} experienced in extensive earlier testing. Changes to the operational thermal environment were noted based on analytical prediction of modifications that affected performance and on stationary thermal measurements adjacent to the rotor assembly. A detailed structural investigation was required to reveal the mechanism of distress induced by the change. The turbine disk experienced cracking in several locations due to increased thermal gradient induced stress during start and shutdown transients. This was easily predictable using standard analysis procedures and expected once the thermal environment was characterized. What was not expected was the curling of a piston ring used for blade axial retention in the disk, indentation of the <b>axial</b> <b>face</b> of the blade attachment by a spacer separating the first and second stage blades, and most significantly, galling and cracking of the blade root attachment that could have resulted in blade release. Past experience, in gas turbine environments, set a precedent of never relying on friction for help and to evaluate it only in specific instances where it was obvious that it would degrade capability. In each of the three cases above, friction proved to be a determining factor that pushed the components into an unsatisfactory mode of operation. The higher than expected temperatures and rapid thermal transients combined with friction to move beyond past experience. The turbine disk/blade assembly configuration contributed to the potential for these problems to occur by limiting the radial deflection from thermals and centrifugal loading. The cooled solid bore configuration was chosen to improve rotordynamic stability by limiting the length of rotor overhang while still protecting the roller bearing by maintaining zero slope under the inner race. During a start transient, the rim area of the disk heats rapidly and expands axially and circumferentially and requires corresponding radial and axial growth of the disk to maintain relative positioning of the disk, blades, spacers and retainer rings. The stiffness, large thermal mass, and bore cooling flow combine to severely limit the disk rim radial growth which results in the potential for relative movement between these parts. Friction then becomes a player in the determination of component stress...|$|E

40|$|Unsaturated sugars {{constitute}} as {{an important}} category of carbohydrate precursors in synthesis. Specifically, 1, 2 - and 2, 3 -unsaturated glycosides are excellent intermediates to derivatize monosaccharides and as building blocks in organic synthesis. For example, a major utility of 1, 2 -unsaturated sugars, namely glycals, is the addition reactions to afford 2 -deoxy glycosides under acidic conditions and rearrangement reactions to produce 2, 3 -unsaturated glycosides. Lewis acids favour the formation of 2, 3 -unsaturated glycosides, whereas, Brønsted acids lead to normal addition products. A mixture of both the product is obtained often, depending on the nucleophiles and the stereochemistry of glycal. Chapter 1 of the thesis describes (i) reactivities of glycals under acidic condition and (ii) a general survey of reactions involving on C 2 -C 3 carbons of monosaccharides. Glycals are useful precursors to derive a number of functionalized monosaccharide derivatives. A well-known acid catalyzed reaction of glycals is their conversion to 2, 3 ¬unsaturated glycosides, known as the Ferrier products. In a research programme, reactivity switching and selective activation of C- 1 or C- 3 of 2, 3 -unsaturated thioglycosides under acid catalyzed condition was undertaken. Thioglycosides are excellent glycosyl donors and can be activated easily. In identifying the reactivities of 2, 3 -unsaturated thioglycosides, obtained through Ce(IV) -mediated reaction of a glycal, {{it was intended to}} study the glycosylation reaction and also the reactivity control of C 1 -C 3 carbons during a glycosylation reaction. Experiments showed that a reactivity switching was possible through activation of either C- 1 or C- 3. Thus, C- 1 glycosylation with alcohol acceptors occurred in the presence of NIS/TfOH, without the acceptors reacting at C- 3. On the other hand, reaction of 2, 3 -unsaturated thioglycosides with alcohols mediated by triflic acid alone led to a transposition of C- 1 ethylthio-moiety to C- 3 intramolecularly, to form 3 -ethylthio-glycals. Resulting glycals underwent glycosylation with alcohols to afford 3 -ethylthio- 2 -deoxy glycosides. However, when thiol was used as an acceptor, only a stereoselective addition at C- 3 resulted, so as to form C- 1, C- 3 dithio-substituted 2 -deoxypyranosides. Oxocarbenium ion is the reactive intermediate during activation of a glycosyl donor, {{and in the case of}} a 2, 3 -unsaturated thioglycosides, the oxocarbenium ion may stabilize further by the presence of a C 2 -C 3 unsaturation. Reaction of a nucleophile with allylic oxocarbenium ion may lead to two regio-isomers. Initially, NIS/TfOH was attempted on 2, 3 –unsaturated sugar with various alcohols and it was found that C- 1 was the preferred reactive centre (Scheme 1) Scheme 1 In order to optimize the reaction for selective nucleophilic attack at C- 3, further study was continued by using stoichiometric TfOH, in presence of acceptors alcohols with the intension to activate the double bond. The reaction led to the formation of 2 -deoxy O-glycosides with the concomitant transposition of C- 1 ethylthio-moiety to C- 3 (Scheme 2). Scheme 2 An important observation was that the transposition of thioethyl group from C- 1 to C- 3 was highly regioselective. For example, with thiocresol as the nucleophile, there was an addition across the C- 2 -C- 3 double bond to afford C- 1, C- 3 -dithio derivative (Scheme 2). Thus, hard-soft nature of the nucleophiles, as well as, carbon centres helped to rationalize the reactivites. It was also observed that the intramolecular transposition of thioethyl group is highly stereo-controlled by equatorial C- 4 acetoxy group. Thus, thioethyl nucleophile approached selectively at C- 3 and afforded trans-diequatorial products. This rationalization was further confirmed through (i) reaction of benzyl protected 2, 3 -unsaturated thioglycoside, wherein a C- 3 epimeric mixture was observed in 1 : 1 ratio; (ii) galactosyl derivative under similar reaction condition afforded anomeric mixture of 3 -(4 -methylphenylthio) -O-glycosides, with trans-diaxial orientation of substituent at C- 3 (Scheme 3). Scheme 3 These reactions confirmed the role of C- 4 substituent on the carbocation at C- 3, through the presence or absence of a neighbouring group participation. In summary, in Chapter 2 the selective activation of either anomeric carbon or C- 3 with proper choice of activation and reactivity control at each carbon will be described. Thioglycosides are excellent glyosyl donor and their glycosylation reactions were well explored. Upon indentifying the intramolecular transposition of thioalkyl/aryl functionality from C- 1 to C- 3, further investigations was undertaken to utilize the newly formed carbon sulfur bonds at C- 3. Realizing a potential for such 3 -alkyl/aryl thio 2 -deoxy sugar, the Pummerer rearrangement was investigated. For this purpose, the thioalkyl/aryl moiety at C- 3 was oxidized first to a sulfoxide. The resulting sulfoxide was allowed to undergo Pummerer rearrangement to afford vinyl sulfide (Scheme 4), resulting from the elimination of HOAc in the thioacetal formed in situ. Having implemented Pummerer rearrangement on a sugar substrate, synthetic utility of the rearrangement product, namely vinyl sulfide was undertaken. An effort to implement conjugate addition reaction was undertaken, which required the conversion of vinyl sulfide to vinyl sulfoxide in the first step. The conjugate addition reactions were first conducted with alkoxide nucleophiles. The reaction showed that addition of nucleophiles occurred from <b>axial</b> <b>face</b> to furnish manno-configured derivatives as a single diastereomer at sulfinyl sulfur in a moderate yield along with O-deacetylated product. It was also found that O-benzyl protected sugar vinyl sulfoxide was totally resistant to the conjugate addition reaction (Scheme 4). Scheme 4 In order to find the influence of the substituents in sulfoxide moiety in the addition of nucleophiles, additional study was conducted in which a less hindered thioethyl moiety was installed in place of p-tolylthio moiety. To install ethylthio moiety, a similar sequence of reaction was undertaken as described previously in Scheme 4. Conjugate addition reaction with alkoxide nucleophiles was conducted and analysis of the reaction showed that the addition of alkoxides remained similar, leading to the formation of manno-configuration of substituents (Scheme 5). Scheme 5 The configuration of the Michael adducts were ascertained from 1 H NMR, as well as 2 D NMR spectroscopies. H- 1 of all adducts appeared as an apparent singlet, consistent with very small J 1, 2 values. Aryl vinyl sulfoxide afforded conjugate addition product at much higher ratio than corresponding alkyl vinyl sulfoxide. Thus, among aryl and alkyl vinyl sulfoxides, conjugate addition occurred better with the aryl vinyl sulfoxide, indicating a strong electronic effect of aryl group in stabilizing the conjugate anion which would form in situ during nucleophilic addition with vinyl sulfoxide. Therefore, p-tolylthio substituted vinyl sulfoxide served as a more efficient Michael acceptor when compared to the thioethyl substituted vinyl sulfoxide. Asymmetric environment of vinyl sulfoxides play a vital role during the reaction. Vinyl sulfoxides can exist in two stereochemically distinct conformation which makes the vinyl group electronically dissimilar. In one of the conformer S-O and C-C bonds are coplanar, whereas in the other conformation, these two bonds are opposite to each other. It is agreed generally that vinyl sulfoxides generally try to adopt the most reactive conformer during the reaction in which the C-C and S-O bonds are syn to each other. Thus, the preference for an axial attack would originate from a face anti to the lone pair of electrons on the sulfur of sulfoxide functionality, leading to the formation of the product with manno-configuration. As O-deacetylated vinyl sulfoxide was obtained along with the Michael adducts, it was assumed that one of the epimers of vinyl sulfoxide appeared to be more reactive when compared to the other. Chapter 3 describes implementation of a Pummerer rearrangement in order to synthesize a sugar vinyl sulfoxide and its conjugate addition reactions with alkoxide nucleophiles. The nucleophilic addition reactions of vinyl sulfoxide with other nucleophiles were studied further. The effect of the substituents of chiral sulfoxides in conjugate addition reactions was also incorporated in the course of reactions. Reactions of amines, carbon and sulfur nucleophiles were undertaken with p-tolylthio-substituted vinyl sulfoxides. The reactions showed formation of the addition-elimination products (Scheme 6). All primary amines, carbon and sulfur nucleophiles afforded C- 2 axial epimer, namely, threo-epimer exclusively, wherein secondary amines furnished the equatorial vs axial epimer in 3 : 1 ratio. Scheme 6 In order to assess the course of the reaction, vinyl sulfoxide presenting a p-cumenethio¬moiety was installed in place of p-tolylthio moiety. Conjugate addition reactions were performed with both primary as well as secondary amines that showed formation of the C- 2 epimeric mixtures. With both the primary and secondary amines C- 2 equatorial epimer was found to be as the major product (Scheme 7). Scheme 7 In conjugate addition of vinyl sulfoxides, nucleophiles approach the olefinic face preferentially, which is anti to the electron rich sulfur lone pair of electrons and syn to the bulky aryl group. Therefore, C- 2 axial epimer was observed as most favourable product. However, secondary amines remarkably influenced the pattern as well as selectivity of the reaction. Steric considerations were likely to dictate the overall reactivity with secondary amines which was even more pronounced when using p-cumenethio-substituted vinyl sulfoxide. Chapter 4 describes the conjugate additions as well as remote effect of aryl substituent on the selectivity of addition of amines on sugar sulfoxide In summary, the Thesis establishes: A new reactivity of switching and a selective activation of 2, 3 -unsaturated thioglycoside; A Pummerer rearrangement route in order to synthesize sugar vinyl sulfide for the first time, which on selective oxidation furnish a sugar vinyl sulfoxide, a useful precursor for conjugate addition reactions; An assessment of the stereoelectronic, as well as, steric effect of the chiral vinyl sulfoxide with various nucleophiles in conjugate addition reactions; Influence of the protecting groups were also studied in conjugate addition reactions. Overall the study presented in the Thesis provides a new insight to unsaturated sugars. The salient features of the present findings also showed that the intermediates such as C- 3 substituted thioalkyl/aryl glycosides, vinyl sulfides, a variety of new C- 2 substituted vinyl sulfoxides are also the potential sites for many types of modifications in monosaccharides.

Phosphine sufonate ligands have been successfully developed for neutral palladium alkyls that promote incorporation of polar vinyl monomers into polyethylene chains producing highly linear copolymers. In the past decade, extensively investigated sulfonate ligands are mainly three types, phosphine-sulfonate, NHC-sulfonate, and olate-sulfonate. Phosphine-sulfonate ligands support palladium(II) for catalysis of ethylene copolymerization with polar vinyl monomers. They also support ruthenium(II) and (IV) forming complexes that are catalysts in regioselective alkylation reactions. NHC-sulfonate ligands form copper(I) complexes promoting asymmetric conjugate addition with high enantioselectivity. One olate-sulfonate ligand is known. It can stabilize Ru(II) to form a Ru(II) alkenylidene complex to perform ring closure metathesis (RCM). The literature has shown that sulfonate ligands have unique catalytic properties. Pursuing enhanced donor capability and tunable electronic and steric properties while retaining the unique catalytic properties of the sulfonate donor, we have developed a series of phosphinimine-sulfonate ligands which employ phosphinimine as a co-donor. The phosphinimine-sulfonate ligands are synthesized in their zwitterionic forms from commercially available toluidine-sufonic acid and in 7 steps. The synthetic steps include chlorination of sulfonic acid, formation of alkyl sulfonate esters, diazotization of amines, azidation of diazonium salts, formation of phosphazene group via Staudinger reaction, and protonation-deprotection of the phosphazene. The zwitterionic ligands are air-stable and convenient for creation of a ligand library. The desired anionic ligands can be readily generated by deprotonation with sodium hydride. Phosphinimine-sulfonate ligands show good coordination ability with palladium precursors such as (cod) PdMeCl or Py 2 PdMeCl to form corresponding palladium methyl complexes. Palladium methyl complexes containing triphenyl, methyldiphenyl, di-n-butylphenyl, and tri-n-butylphosphinimine-sulfonate ligands have been synthesized. A thermal behavior study of the synthesized palladium methyl complexes showed that 2, 6 -positions of the phosphiniminobenzene rings are subjected to orthopalladation.

40|$|Improvements upon current {{gas turbine}} sealing {{technology}} performance {{are essential for}} decreasing specific fuel consumption to meet stringent future efficiency targets. The clearances between rotating and static components of a gas turbine, which need to be sealed, vary over a flight cycle. Hence, a seal which can passively maintain an optimum clearance, whilst preventing contact between itself and the rotor, is extremely desirable. Various configurations of a Rolls Royce (RR) seal concept, the Large <b>Axial</b> Movement <b>Face</b> Seal (LAMFS), use static pressure forces to locate face seals. Prototypes were tested experimentally at the Osney Thermofluids Laboratory, Oxford. Firstly a proof-of concept rig (simulating a 2 -D seal cross-section) manufactured by RR was re-commissioned. The simplest configuration using parallel seal faces induced an unstable seal housing behaviour. The author used this result, CFD, and analytical methods to improve the design and provide a self-centring ability. A fully annular test rig of this new seal concept was then manufactured to simulate a 3 D engine representative seal. The full annulus eliminated leakage paths unavoidable in the simpler rig. A parametric program of experiments was designed to identify geometries and conditions which favoured best-practice design. The new seal design {{is in the process}} of being patented by Rolls Royce. A 'fluidic' seal was also investigated, showing very promising results. A test rig was manufactured so that a row of jets could be directed across a leakage cross-flow. An experimental program identified parameters which could achieve a combined lower leakage mass flow rate compared with the original leakage. Influence of jet spanwise spacing, injection angle, jet to mainstream pressure ratio, mainstream pressure difference and channel height were analysed. It is hoped this thesis can be used as a tool to further improve these seal concepts from the parametric trends which were identified experimentally.

The outcomes studied were: (1) the performance of post-processing 3 D face volumes {{for the detection of}} facial clefts; (2) the ability of a resident with minimal 3 DUS experience to reconstruct the acquired facial volumes, and (3) the time needed to reconstruct each plane to allow proper diagnosis of a cleft.

Such a very essential system is turboexpander which {{is used in the}} several applications to provide very low-temperature cooling and refrigeration. Nowadays, turboexpander systems are using gas bearings to operate friction free, noiseless and for smooth operation. The main problem for these turboexpander systems is a heavy contact of rotor parts with the static parts i. e. thrust bearing surface at the time of start-up and shut-down of the machinery. The rotary system of the modern turboexpanders, after using gas bearings to support against radial as well as <b>axial</b> thrust are <b>facing</b> the wearing problem with the static parts at the time of start and stop. To avoid the problem, an auxiliary passive magnetic bearing is modelled by using Finite Element Method Magnetics (FEMM) that can suspend the rotor system without heavy contact with the lower thrust bearing surface during start-up and shut-down. This magnetic bearing has to levitate a designed rotary system of weight approximately 2. 64 N, which consists a rotor, a brake compressor and a turbine wheel.
