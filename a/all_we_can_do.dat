The Uniformed Firefighters Association initially supported it, but withdrew when the connection to the Church of Scientology was revealed. Firefighter Union President Patrick Bahnken said his members' lives had benefited from the program, {{and that it had}} involved no religious rhetoric. Deputy Fire Commissioner Frank Gribbon of the FDNY told The New York Times, [...] "while we are aware some members of the department have availed themselves of the program, we in no way endorse it." [...] Officials at the department raised concerns that firefighters were giving up existing medications in order to take part.

The judgement, which was delivered by Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, on 18March 2009 concluded: [...] "The decision leaves some important, unanswered questions.

500|$|As {{the release}} of the new album approached, the band and its {{management}} found {{that they would have to}} navigate changes in the music industry, which Hurley described as [...] "a completely different place." [...] Facing declining record sales, the lack of a proper outlet for exhibition of music videos, and the economic crisis, Hurley commented that [...] "people are buying things they need to survive rather than records and concert tickets." [...] The group's 2007 album Infinity on High sold one million copies, which was considered a disappointment compared to From Under the Cork Trees sales of three million. Trohman attributed this to [...] "the same reason that nobody's records are selling that well: there's so much turmoil in the music industry, so much downsizing, and people are finding different ways to get their music more and more all the time. There's very little we can do about that as a band. <b>All</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is try to make great music and hope it connects with people." ...|$|E

500|$|Wallace {{wrote on}} other social and {{political}} topics including his support for women's suffrage, and repeatedly on the dangers and wastefulness of militarism. In an essay published in 1899 Wallace called for popular opinion to be rallied against warfare by showing people: [...] "...that all modern wars are dynastic; that they are caused by the ambition, the interests, the jealousies, and the insatiable greed of power of their rulers, or of the great mercantile and financial classes which have power and influence over their rulers; and {{that the results of}} war are never good for the people, who yet bear all its burthens". In a letter published by the Daily Mail in 1909, with aviation in its infancy, he advocated an international treaty to ban the military use of aircraft, arguing against the idea [...] "...that this new horror is [...] "inevitable," [...] and that <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is to be sure and be in the front rank of the aerial assassins—for surely no other term can so fitly describe the dropping of, say, ten thousand bombs at midnight into an enemy's capital from an invisible flight of airships." ...|$|E

He said: [...] "I think other states will make their own judgments, and I expect them to–that's their own business. <b>All</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is tend our own garden, and make sure that it's weeded, and I think we've weeded out a discriminatory law that we should have." ...|$|E

Behind the scenes high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about the UFOs.

Reference (a) advised that Com 16 {{intercepts}} were considered most reliable and requested Com 16 to evaluate reports on Japanese naval movements and send dispatch to OPNAV, info CINCPAC. Com 16's estimates were more reliable than Com 14's, not only because of better radio interception, but because Com 16 was currently reading messages in the Japanese Fleet Cryptographic System ("5-number code" [...] or [...] "JN25") and was exchanging technical information and Japanese-to-English translations with the British C. I. Unit at Singapore. Lt. Cdr. Arthur H. McCollum was aware of this, and it may have been part of his thinking when he drafted the McCollum memo. Duane L. Whitlock, traffic analyst at CAST, was not aware before the attack IJN movement traffic code was being read.

60|$|Now, therefore, surely such a {{heart as}} this is must needs be very {{delightful}} to God. He says to us, 'My son, give me thine heart' (Prov 23:26).

We are not able to give better satisfaction for breaking God's laws, than by breaking our own hearts; this is <b>all</b> that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> of that kind; for the blood of Christ only must give the due and full satisfaction to the justice of God for what provocations we are at any time guilty of; but <b>all</b> that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is to accompany the acknowledgments we make of miscarriages with a broken and contrite spirit. Therefore we find, that when David had committed those two foul sins of adultery and murder, against God, he saw that all his sacrifices signified nothing to the expiating of his guilt; therefore he brings to God a broken heart, which carried in it the best expression of indignation against himself, as of the highest respect he could show to God (2 Cor 7:11).|$|R
