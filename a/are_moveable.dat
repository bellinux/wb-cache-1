5|$|Tomáš Krýza (1838 - 1918) {{built in}} a period of over 60 years a nativity scene {{covering}} 60 m² (length 17 m, size and height 2 m) which contains 1389 figures of humans and animals, of which 133 <b>are</b> <b>moveable.</b> It is on display in Jindřichův Hradec, Czech Republic. Since 1998, it figures as the largest mechanical nativity scene in the world in the Guinness Book of World Records.|$|E
5|$|The {{combat system}} in Dawn of Mana {{is called the}} Mono system, based around the Havok physic engine. Almost all objects in the game, {{including}} enemies, <b>are</b> <b>moveable,</b> allowing Keldric to throw objects at enemies, or even throw other monsters. Keldric can either throw objects in the direction he is facing, or can target a specific enemy or object to aim at them. When something is thrown near an enemy, they Panic, resulting in a counter over their head that counts down to zero to end the Panic. While panicked, enemies take more damage from attacks and spells. Defeating enemies when they are panicked gives the player two types of medals, which can either boost the player's health and attack damage, or mana and magic damage. Throwing multiple objects can Panic enemies more; when the Panic meter is greater than 99 the player can receive better medals. Defeating enemies also grants experience points, which raise Keldric and Faye's level up {{to a maximum of}} four, granting higher health, mana, and damage, and granting new spells and attacks. In addition to being throwable, many objects in the game are also destructible.|$|E
25|$|Easter and the {{holidays}} {{that are related}} to it <b>are</b> <b>moveable</b> feasts which do not fall on a fixed date in the Gregorian or Julian calendars which follow only the cycle of the sun; rather, its date is determined on a lunisolar calendar similar to the Hebrew calendar. The First Council of Nicaea (325) established two rules, independence of the Jewish calendar and worldwide uniformity, which were the only rules for Easter explicitly laid down by the council. No details for the computation were specified; these were worked out in practice, a process that took centuries and generated a number of controversies. It has come to be the first Sunday after the ecclesiastical full moon that occurs on or soonest after 21 March, but calculations vary.|$|E

25|$|Easter and the {{holidays}} {{that are related}} to it <b>are</b> <b>moveable</b> feasts, in that they do not fall on a fixed date in the Gregorian or Julian calendars (both of which follow the cycle of the sun and the seasons). Instead, the date for Easter is determined on a lunisolar calendar similar to the Hebrew calendar. The First Council of Nicaea (325) established two rules, independence of the Jewish calendar and worldwide uniformity, which were the only rules for Easter explicitly laid down by the Council. No details for the computation were specified; these were worked out in practice, a process that took centuries and generated a number of controversies. (See also Computus and Reform of the date of Easter.) In particular, the Council did not decree that Easter must fall on Sunday. This was already the practice almost everywhere.|$|E
25|$|In {{the center}} of the hall is a large open square, above which is a domed ceiling about 10 feet in {{diameter}} and 6 feet deep. At the top is a lotus bud with Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva carved on it. At the bottom of the dome is a series of friezes with the Ramayana story. On the capitals of the four pillars are madanikas (Salabhanjika). One represents dancing Saraswati, the Hindu god of knowledge, arts and music. The others are regular dancers, but with different expressions. One is dressing her hair, the other in a Natya posture, and the fourth has a parrot seated on her hand. The head and neck jewelry made of rock are freely mounted and can be moved. The bracelets similarly <b>are</b> <b>moveable.</b> The design of the celing follows the Hindu texts, and is a modified utksipta style with images placed in concentric rings.|$|E

50|$|Stocking-weaver Tomáš Krýza (1838 - 1918) was a burgher from Jindřichův Hradec (a town in today's South Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic).

It {{contains}} 1389 figures of humans and animals, of which 133 <b>are</b> <b>moveable.</b> The material used was wood, flour, sawdust, gypsum and fish glue. The mechanical parts were originally powered manually, now single electrical motor is used.|$|E

50|$|Among many religions, a feast {{is a set}} of {{celebrations}} in honour of Gods or God. A feast and {{a festival}} are historically interchangeable. Most religions have festivals that recur annually and some, such as Passover, Easter and Eid al-Adha <b>are</b> <b>moveable</b> feasts - that is, those that are determined either by lunar or agricultural cycles or the calendar in use at the time. The Sed festival, for example, celebrated the thirtieth year of an Egyptian pharaoh's rule and then every three (or four in one case) years after that.|$|E

50|$|Given {{that the}} {{building}} has no storage space architect Morana Vlahović developed {{a new way of}} exhibiting contemporary art works. Due to its status as a protected cultural monument, no digging was allowed beneath the floor level of the building. Therefore, the depot needs to function inside and together with the exhibition space. The architect came up with aluminium panels which replace the exhibition walls. Each panel is 5 meters wide and 3.5 meters high, with each divided into a 3 meter wide solid part, and 2 meter wide thick wire mesh. The panels <b>are</b> <b>moveable</b> and so it is possible to switch from a completely open space to a dense maze of panels.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the season}} of Great Lent <b>is</b> <b>moveable,</b> {{beginning}} on different dates from year to year, accommodation must be made for various feast days on the fixed calendar (Menaion) which occur during the season. When these feasts fall a weekday of Great Lent, the normal Lenten aspect of the services is lessened to celebrate the solemnity.|$|R

50|$|The Half-Mile Telescope was {{constructed}} in 1968 (2 aerials) at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory with two more aerials being added in 1972, using donated dishes (total cost was £70,000). Two of the dishes are fixed, while two <b>are</b> <b>moveable</b> and share the One-Mile's rail track; to obtain information from {{the maximum number of}} different baselines, 30 days of observing were required. Observing frequency 1.4 GHz (21 cm wavelength), bandwidth 4 MHz. Used for Hydrogen Line studies of nearby galaxies and produced the first good radio maps of hydrogen distribution (as a function of its velocity), for M33 and M31 (also produced nearly 20 PhDs and 50 published papers). The telescope was operated by the Radio Astronomy Group of the Cambridge University.|$|E
5000|$|The Minus Cube («Минус-кубик») is a 3D {{mechanical}} {{variant of}} the n-puzzle which was manufactured in the Soviet Union. It consists of a bonded transparent plastic box containing seven small cubes, each glued together from two U-shape parts: one white and one coloured. The length of {{one side of the}} interior of the box is slightly more than twice the length of the side of a small cube. There is an empty space the size of one small cube inside the box and the small cubes <b>are</b> <b>moveable</b> inside the box by tilting the box causing a cube to fall into the space. The goal of the puzzle is to shuffle the cubes {{in such a way that}} on each side of the box, all of the faces of the small cubes are one color.|$|E
50|$|The tower {{originally}} had Hains oil lamps, which were replaced in 1893 with Funck-Heap lamps. The station was deactivated in 1932.
