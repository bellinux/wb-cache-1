5|$|To {{prevent any}} similar {{incidents}} from reoccurring, Nintendo quickly ordered the episode pulled, {{and it has}} not aired since, not even outside Japan. Maddie Blaustein, the English dub voice of Meowth, said twice on the Serebii.net forums that this episode was dubbed in the United States by 4Kids Entertainment. On the other hand, Veronica Taylor, the English voice of Ash, claimed that this episode was never dubbed and will not be dubbed, though this was contradicted again on September 25, 2016, when Eric Stuart, the English dub voice of Brock and James, said that 4Kids did indeed dub the episode. Regardless, any plans to release this episode outside Japan were abandoned after Nintendo objected, and it was never broadcast anywhere else in the world. Coincidentally, the episode aired around the same time Pokémon was being adapted for American audiences. 4Kids Entertainment's dub took extra precaution in bright <b>and</b> <b>flashing</b> lights in the show, using the post-1997 versions altering lighting and the frequency of flashing lights for earlier episodes of their American release.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effect of}} the high blending ratio (HBR) biodiesel storage on the acid value <b>and</b> <b>flashes</b> point temperature. The samples used, standard diesel (STD), B 80, B 90, and B 100 were stored at temperature 24 °C for nine weeks in a box. The acid value <b>and</b> <b>flash</b> point temperature were measured according to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) procedure. The results show that the acid value <b>and</b> <b>flash</b> point temperature of the samples were increased almost 10 % with the rise of 10 % biodiesel blending ratio. Under long storage duration, the acid value <b>and</b> <b>flash</b> point temperature for all the samples are nearest to constant. Consequently, there are no significant effect on the acid value <b>and</b> <b>flash</b> point temperature when all the samples were stored in the dark place at room temperature (24 °C) for a long period...|$|R

25|$|Soldering is the {{preferred}} joining method where strong, watertight joints are required, such as for internal gutters, roofing, <b>and</b> <b>flashing</b> applications.

25|$|Because no British {{airborne}} {{operations were}} contemplated for the Allied Invasion of Italy, Williams directed both the 51st and 52nd Troop Carrier Wings to train with the 82nd Airborne Division. Taking {{the lessons of}} Sicily to heart, pathfinders were created. These were aircrew with the best available navigators carrying specially trained paratroops equipped with navigational aids. These included the British Rebecca/Eureka transponding radar <b>and</b> <b>flashing</b> Krypton lamps. The pathfinders' role was to locate and mark the drop zones for other airborne units. pathfinder training was conducted in Tunisia and encouraging results led to Williams' decision to employ Eureka in upcoming operations.|$|E

The man in the car parked behind her, approached her car, stated that he observed that her right rear wheel was wobbling, and offered to tighten the lug nuts. After finishing his work, the man drove off; yet when Johns pulled forward to re-enter the highway the wheel almost immediately came off the car. The man returned, offering to drive her to the nearest gas station for help. She and her daughter climbed into his car.|$|E
