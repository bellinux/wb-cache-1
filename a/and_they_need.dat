5|$|First Class : This {{advancement}} badge is {{the first}} advancement badge that places the Scout {{in a position of}} leadership and organisation. A Scout is required to plan and run a wide game for their Patrol, a Patrol camp, an overnight Patrol hike for which a log book must be written, a programme to teach younger Scouts in their Patrol about pioneering, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to assist in the planning of a Scouts' Own.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the story, the two sides face off in a major battle that sees the deaths of many soldiers, {{including}} their leaders Larg and Goltana. Ramza manages to stop the bloodshed from continuing and rescues the general Cidolfas Orlandu, though the Church succeeds in eliminating the two Lions to secure its power over Ivalice. Deeper into the story, Ramza discovers that the Shrine Knights are in reality Lucavi, and the real conspirators behind the Church's plot. The Lucavi are seeking to resurrect their leader Altima, who in the past was Saint Ajora, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> much bloodshed and a suitable body to complete the resurrection. Alma is to serve as the host for Altima's incarnation. While racing off to find her, Ramza encounters Dycedarg - now a Lucavi demon - and witnesses Zalbag's death. Zalbag is then risen and converted into an undead servant, and frequently begs for death during the encounter.|$|E
5|$|Coronation Street aired {{a special}} live episode to {{celebrate}} the sixtieth anniversary of ITV. In the episode Callum and Kylie's sister-in-law Sarah Platt (Tina O'Brien) argue inside the Platt's home. Callum attacks Sarah, overpowers her and threatens her life. Kylie walks in on the struggle and hits Callum {{over the head with}} a wrench. Her actions left Callum bloody and dead on her kitchen floor. The live episode concluded with David returning home to the fatal scene. He decides to help Kylie and Sarah to conceal Callum's murder. He wraps the body up and puts him down a manhole in their garage. The following episode features the trio plotting to dispose of Callum's body in a public space. An ongoing conversion of the garage in a bedroom extension poses a problem <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to move quickly, but a series of events ruin their plans. Kylie and David are physically sick when they first try to remove the body from the manhole. They are later interrupted by a visit from the police who investigate Callum's abandoned car. Gail then hires Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) to cover up the manhole with concrete, unaware Callum is concealed inside.|$|E

25|$|Option ARMs {{are best}} suited to {{sophisticated}} borrowers with growing incomes, particularly if their incomes fluctuate seasonally <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> the payment flexibility that such an ARM may provide. Sophisticated borrowers will carefully manage the level of negative amortization that they allow to accrue.|$|E
25|$|Surface-mount {{components}} like MLCCs are cheaper, {{because they}} have no leads and a little bit smaller than their counterparts with leads, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> no holes in the PCB, a second reduction of costs.

25|$|There {{are many}} {{theories}} and associations that swirl around the were-jaguar motif, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> not be not mutually exclusive. It {{is possible that}} were-jaguars meant different things at different times during the Olmec period or to the many different people who created the images. The matter is far from settled.|$|E

25|$|T. oahuensis and T.kavaiensis {{have done}} well in {{cultivation}} in Southern California. They are sensitive to heat, but very tolerant of shade, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> some wind protection. In horticulture, T. kavaiensis has often been misidentified as T. meiandra. True T. meiandra is now treated as a synonym of T. oahuensis.|$|E
25|$|Although DirectShow {{is capable}} of {{dynamically}} building a graph to render a given media type, in certain instances {{it is difficult for}} developers to rely on this functionality <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to resort to manually building filter graphs if the resulting filter graph is variable. It is possible for filter graphs to change over time as new filters are installed on the computer.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{commodity}} ETFs are {{index funds}} tracking non-security indices. Because {{they do not}} invest in securities, commodity ETFs are not regulated as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940 in the United States, although their public offering is subject to SEC review <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> an SEC no-action letter under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. They may, however, be subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.|$|E

I think more and more of the experts, the people who really understand the prevention requirements with HIV/AIDS, have come to endorse ABC in a very balanced way as the appropriate prevention centerpiece.|$|E
25|$|Back at the castle, Maurice {{reveals that}} the ogres are now {{advancing}} on their kingdom and believes Belle's actions are to blame. He says that they cannot defend against the ogre army on their own <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> the help of Gaston's kingdom and that Belle will have to marry Gaston to obtain their help. Gaston arrives and proposes to Belle, and Belle reluctantly agrees, as she believes {{it is the only}} way to save the kingdom.|$|E

25|$|The {{degree of}} flexing and the {{material}} constituting the diaphragm affects the maintenance life of the equipment. Generally stiff metal diaphragms may only displace a few cubic centimeters of volume because the metal can not endure large degrees of flexing without cracking, but the stiffness of a metal diaphragm allows it to pump at high pressures. Rubber or silicone diaphragms are capable of enduring deep pumping strokes of very high flexion, but their low strength limits their use to low-pressure applications, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to be replaced as plastic embrittlement occurs.|$|E
25|$|There is {{an overall}} underpricing of formal water and {{sanitation}} services in Sub-Saharan Africa. A first consequence is an insufficient cost recovery, leading to dependency on foreign aid and governmental support, and to insufficient investments. Second, underpricing is socially unfair. Since the poorest social groups are less connected to water networks and sewerage, they need to turn to alternatives, and they pay in some cases a multiple of the formal tariff. Hence, the poorest are hit twice: they have less access to improved water supply and sanitation, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to pay more.|$|E
25|$|Storer, Holmen and Pedersen {{describes}} a netchain {{built around a}} food processor. The food processor uses the output of a meat and a vegetable processor and sells food to restaurants. The meat and vegetable processors are using the output of primary producers, whereas the restaurants serve consumers and {{are connected to the}} vegetable processor and the meat processor as well. Moreover, primary producers also share information with the food processor. The main purpose of the entire food chain/network is to serve consumer needs <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to cooperate to achieve this. As a result, a strongly connected system is formed, which can be described as a netchain.|$|E

25|$|The {{ticketing}} system uses RFID contactless technology with round tokens issued for single trips and a contactless stored value card, the MRT Plus card, for frequent travellers. It is planned that a joint {{ticketing system}} will be set up so that passengers can use a single ticket on the MRT {{as well as on}} the Skytrain. Multi-storey park & ride facilities are provided at Lat Phrao and Thailand Cultural Centre. Motorists who park their cars at these premises will be issued with additional contactless smartcards <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to have them electronically stamped at their destination station. The turnstiles accept cards or tokens, both available from a manned booth or automated ticket machines.|$|E
25|$|Kennel clubs {{provide the}} {{recognition}} of distinct dog breeds, {{but there are many}} independent clubs with differing, and sometime inconsistent standards <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> not apply scientific standards. Four varieties of the Belgian Shepherd Dog are recognised as four distinct breeds by the New Zealand Kennel Club. Further, some groups of dogs which clearly share a persistent set of characteristics and documented descent from a known foundation stock may still not be recognized by some clubs as breeds. For instance, the feist is a hunting dog raised in the Southern United States for hunting small game. Feists have a consistent set of characteristics that reliably differentiate them from other dog types and breeds. However, the United Kennel Club recognizes one breed of feist, the Treeing Feist, while the American Kennel Club does not recognize any feist breed.|$|E
25|$|Kittens {{require a}} high-calorie diet that {{contains}} more protein than the diet of adult cats. Young orphaned kittens require cat milk {{every two to}} four hours, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> physical stimulation to defecate and urinate. Cat milk replacement is manufactured to feed to young kittens, because cow's milk does not provide all the necessary nutrients. Human-reared kittens {{tend to be very}} affectionate with humans as adults and sometimes more dependent on them than kittens reared by their mothers, but they can also show volatile mood swings and aggression. Depending on the age at which they were orphaned and how long they were without their mothers, these kittens may be severely underweight and can have health problems later in life, such as heart conditions. The compromised immune system of orphaned kittens (from lack of antibodies found naturally in the mother's milk) can make them especially susceptible to infections, making antibiotics a necessity.|$|E
30|$|Obstruction of {{the left}} main {{bronchus}} is a rare but life-threatening complication of PDA closure with surgical clips. Harris et al. [1] reported that the PDA clip had been placed across the left main bronchus and caused the left main bronchus obstruction. A significant compression {{of the left}} main bronchus by a surrounding fibrous mass was noted, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> to remove the mass and skeletonize the left main bronchus 2  months after the PDA surgery. Bhat et al. [2] reported that a single PDA clip was applied to both the PDA and the left main bronchus, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> to repair the left main bronchus injury 5  days after the PDA surgery. In these cases, chest computed tomography showed the clip applied across the left main bronchus.|$|R
