40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{sought to}} {{describe}} trends in hospitalizations associated with infectious diseases among <b>American</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>and</b> Alaska Natives. METHODS: Infectious disease hospitalizations <b>and</b> rates among <b>American</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>and</b> Alaska Natives from 1980 through 1994 were examined via Indian Health Service hospital discharge data and compared with published trends for the general US population. RESULTS: Annual hospitalization rates for infectious diseases among <b>American</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>and</b> Alaska Natives decreased by 31. 0 % between 1980 and 1994. Infectious disease hospitalizations accounted for 16. 3 % of all hospitalizations in 1980 and 21. 2 % in 1994, an increase of 30. 1 %. In 1994, the age-adjusted infectious disease hospitalization rate for <b>American</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>and</b> Alaska Natives was 1863 per 100, 000 population, approximately 21 % greater than that for the general US population. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization trends for infectious diseases show {{that there has been}} improvement in the health status of <b>American</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>and</b> Alaska Natives but also indicate that this population has a higher infectious disease burden than the general US population...|$|R
5|$|Several {{accounts}} {{indicate that}} during the Cherry Valley massacre or thereafter, Colonel Stacy was stripped naked and tied to a stake, {{and was about to}} be tortured and killed, as was the ritual for enemy warriors, but was spared by Joseph Brant. William Stacy was a Freemason; Joseph Brant was an educated <b>American</b> <b>Indian,</b> <b>and</b> had also become a Freemason. It is reported that Stacy made an appeal as one Freemason to another, thus saving his life. Colonel Stacy was subsequently taken to Fort Niagara, the Loyalist base in New York and held prisoner under Colonel Butler during the summer of 1779. At Fort Niagara, Molly Brant, the sister of Joseph Brant, was hostile toward Stacy, and wanted Colonel Butler to return custody of Stacy to the Indians. She proclaimed dreams of her and the Indians using Stacy's head in an Indian football game. Colonel Butler placated Molly Brant with rum and protected his prisoner. Subsequently, from late-1779 through mid-1782, Colonel Stacy was held prisoner at Fort Chambly near Montreal.|$|E
5|$|The program {{requires}} that the reverse of the dollar depict a new design every year. In order to determine which design to depict on the coins, officials from the United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, the Native American Caucus and the National Congress of American Indians, the consulting organizations for the program, appoint a liaison to the United States Mint. Between twelve and fifteen themes are selected after consultation with the National Museum of the <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>and</b> the Smithsonian Institution. At this point, the consulting organizations supply the Mint with written comments regarding the themes. The suggestions are then sent to the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee, where a theme is recommended. After reviewing the recommendations and input from the contributing organizations, the selected theme is finalized, at which point designs are produced that represent the theme. Once designs are created, the consulting organizations and the National Museum of the Native American are consulted, and the designs are sent to the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee for approval. Based on all comments and recommendations received, the Mint selects a final design that is recommended to the Secretary of the Treasury for approval.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{identify}} {{the risk and}} protective factors of suicide among <b>American</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>and</b> Alaska Natives. Methods. Using a negative binomial regression analysis and state-level data, pooled data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (2005 - 2010), and the 2000 U. S. Census to examine the state-level predictors of suicide among <b>American</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>and</b> Alaska Natives. Results. An increase in the states’ urban population is associated with increased suicide rates among <b>American</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>and</b> Alaska Natives. An increase in the young male population is associated with decreased suicide risk for the population. No association was found related to religious adherence, or gun ownership. Conclusion.
