Background: Despite the ethical, legal and moral importance of confidentiality within the health-care context, little work has addressed the implications of confidentially related to whistle-blowing events. Methods: The study used qualitative narrative inquiry. Eighteen Australian nurses, with first-hand experience of whistle blowing, consented to face-to-face semi-structured interviews. Results: Four emergent themes relating to confidentiality were identified: (1) confidentiality as enforced silence; (2) confidentiality as isolating and marginalizing; (3) confidentiality as creating a rumour mill; and (4) confidentiality in the context of the public’s ‘right to know’. Conclusions: The interpretation and <b>application</b> of <b>confidentiality</b> influences the outcomes of whistle blowing within the context of health-care services. Conversely, confidentially can be a protective mechanism for health-care institutions.

Moreover, network control systems are a fundamental part of the communication components of current cyber-physical systems (e. g., automotive communications). Many networked control systems employ Time-Triggered (TT) architectures that provide mechanisms enabling the exchange of precise and synchronous messages. TT systems have computation and communication constraints, and with the aim to enable secure communications in the network, it is important to evaluate the computational and communication overhead of implementing secure communication mechanisms. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the effects of adding a Hash-based Message Authentication (HMAC) to TT networked control systems. The contributions of the paper include (1) the analysis and experimental validation of the communication overhead, as well as a scalability analysis that utilizes the experimental result for both wired and wireless platforms and (2) an experimental evaluation of the computational overhead of HMAC based on a kernel-level Linux implementation. An automotive application is used as an example, and the results show that it is feasible to implement a secure communication mechanism without interfering with the existing automotive controller execution times. The methods and results of the paper can be used for evaluating the performance impact of security mechanisms and, thus, for the design of secure wired and wireless TT networked control systems...|$|R

These devices are able to collaborate with each other using wireless communication technologies, and then support many applications. Some interesting examples of these are healthcare, context-aware computing, and sports training. In any such applications, security is of vital importance.

Secondly, authenticity and integrity of data or instructions are always critical; incorrect data or instructions are not only useless, but also harmful in some cases. This thesis analyses the security requirements of personal networks, and develops a number of multi-channel security protocols. With the help of out-of-band channels, especially no-spoofing and no-blocking out-of-band channels, these protocols can bootstrap security in personal networks. In particular, three kinds of security protocols have been studied: protocols that use human-controlled channels, protocols that use visible light communications, and protocols that use intra-body communications. Interesting trade-offs have been discovered among communication, computation and security, resulting from different channel implementations and protocols.

40|$|ABSTRACT- In {{the past}} few decades, the {{development}} {{in the field of}} wireless networks has changed the landscape of wireless communication and network security. This advancement has {{led to the development of}} low-power, low-cost sensor nodes that are considerably small in size and applicable in wire variety of applications like, tracking the movements of tanks and troops on the battlefields, tracking the navigation of ships and sub-marines in the sea, monitoring environmental phenomena like earthquakes, tsunamis, forest fire and also in the field of medicine and science. Hence the security of wireless networks has become a major concern, especially for the <b>applications</b> where <b>confidentiality</b> is of peak importance. While the traditional way of protecting the network with firewall and encryption techniques have proven to be insufficient for wireless networks, the need of more secure and scalable architecture of security has alarmed the requirement of Intrusion Detection System (IDS), which are applicable for wireless networks. In this project, Hierarchical based and Energy Efficient Intrusion Detection System has been implemented, which is more secure, scalable and energy efficient compared to other Intrusion detection Systems...|$|R

Information-flow techniques have been developed {{over the years to}} achieve that purpose, leading to special-purpose languages that guarantee information-flow security in programs. However, rather than producing a new language from scratch, information-flow security can also be provided as a library. This has been done previously in Haskell using the arrow framework. In this paper, we show that arrows are not necessary to design such libraries and that a less general notion, namely monads, is sufficient to achieve the same goals. We present a monadic library to provide information-flow security for Haskell programs. The library introduces mechanisms to protect {{confidentiality of}} data for pure computations, that we then easily, and modularly, extend to include dealing with side-effects. We also present combinators to dynamically enforce different declassification policies when release of information is required in a controlled manner. It is possible to enforce policies related to what, by whom, and when information is released or a combination of them. The well-known concept of monads together with the light-weight characteristic of our approach makes the library suitable to build <b>applications</b> where <b>confidentiality</b> of data is an issue...|$|R

The very features of packet traffic, like packet lengths statistics, inter-packet times, volumes of exchanged traffic, communication patterns, leak information. Leakage ranges from the kind of application that generates the information flow carried into the supposedly secure connection to parts of its content. We propose traffic masking as a countermeasure. Full confidentiality protection is discussed and the traffic masking framework is introduced and motivated. The optimization and performance assessment of the masking device is evaluated both through a general analytical model, mainly useful to gain basic insight, and by a real network emulation of a distributed secure multiparty computation <b>application,</b> where <b>confidentiality</b> requirements are key to the application itself. It is shown that essentially full confidentiality can be attained for a practical distributed security application by accepting an increase of the traffic volume by a factor 2. 4 and an increase of the task completion time of 30 %.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{multi-tenant}} SaaS <b>applications,</b> data <b>confidentiality</b> support is increasingly being offered from within the application layer instead of the database layer or the storage layer to accommodate continuously changing requirements of multiple tenants. Application-level data management middleware platforms are becoming increasingly compelling {{for dealing with the}} complexity of a multi-cloud or a federated cloud storage architecture as well as multi-tenant SaaS applications. However, these platforms typically support traditional data mapping strategies that are created under the assumption of a fixed and rigorous database schema. Thus, mapping data objects while supporting varying data confidentiality requirements, therefore, leads to fragmentation of data over distributed storage nodes. This introduces significant performance overhead at the level of individual database transactions (e. g., CRUD transactions) and negatively affects the overall scalability. To address these challenges, we present a dedicated data mapping strategy that leverages the data schema flexibility of columnar NoSQL databases to accomplish dynamic and fine-grained data encryption in a more efficient and scalable manner. We validate these solutions in {{the context of}} an industrial multi-tenant SaaS application and conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation. The results confirm that the proposed data mapping strategy indeed yields scalability and performance improvements. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, {{multicasting}} is increasingly used as an efficient communication mechanism for group-oriented applications in the Internet. Some multicast <b>applications</b> require <b>confidentiality</b> for transmitted data. So, a traffic encryption key is used to assure this confidentiality {{and has to be}} changed and distributed to all valid members whenever a membership change (join or leave) occurs in the group. The bandwidth used for re-keying operations could be high when the group size is large. To cope with this limitation, many solutions propose to organize group members into subgroups that use independent traffic encryption keys in order to mitigate the scope of key management and thereby to scale better to large groups. Unfortunately, these solutions require the decryption and re-encryption of multicast messages whenever they pass from one subgroup to another. Moreover, the decryption / re-encryption operations induce delays in packet delivery throughout the delivery path. In order to avoid delays in packet delivery and perturbations caused by re-keying, we propose in this paper an adaptive solution for key management which organizes group members into dynamic and homogeneous clusters according to the application level requirements. First, we show that partitioning the group into clusters of subgroups that use independent traffic encryption keys can be formulated as tree partitioning problem. Then, we propose a protocol to solve the problem with respect to the application requirements and membership behavior.
