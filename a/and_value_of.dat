5000|$|According to the Bortkiewiczian interpretation, prices <b>and</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> inputs {{into the}} {{production}} process are, in Marx's theory, determined simultaneously with the prices <b>and</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> the outputs that later emerge from {{the production process}}. Thus, inputs' prices (or <b>values)</b> <b>and</b> outputs' prices (or values) are necessarily equal. In contrast, the TSSI is [...] "temporal" [...] or non-simultaneous, holding that prices (<b>and</b> <b>values)</b> <b>of</b> inputs <b>and</b> outputs in Marx's theory need not be (and generally are not) equal.|$|R

5|$|Since the FairTax {{would not}} tax used goods, {{some critics have}} argued that this would create a {{differential}} between the price of new and used goods, which may take years to equalize. Such a differential would certainly influence the sale of new goods like vehicles and homes. Similarly, some supporters have claimed that this would create an incentive to buy used goods, creating environmental benefits of re-use and re-sale. Conversely, {{it is argued that}} like the income tax system that contains embedded tax cost (see Theories of retail pricing), used goods would contain the embedded FairTax cost. While the FairTax would not be applied to the retail sales of used goods, the inherent value of a used good includes the taxes paid when the good was sold at retail. The value is determined by the supply and demand in relation to new goods. The price differential / margins between used and new goods should stay consistent, as the cost <b>and</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> used goods are in direct relationship to the cost <b>and</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the new goods.|$|E

The price differential/margins between used and new goods would stay consistent, as the cost <b>and</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> used goods are in direct relationship to the cost <b>and</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the new goods. Because the U.S. tax system has a hidden effect on prices, it is expected that moving to the FairTax would decrease production costs from the removal of business taxes and compliance costs, which is predicted to offset a portion of the FairTax effect on prices.|$|E
5|$|An inter-municipal railway {{committee}} {{was established in}} 1941. Led by Sigval Bergesen, it considered the possibility of extending the Ålgård Line towards Hunnedalen via Setesdalsheiene to Lunde in Telemark. The line would be built with a higher standard than the Sørlandet Line and have a shorter route, allowing travel time from Stavanger to Oslo to be reduced to four to five hours. A detailed plan was made for the extension from Ålgård to the county border with Telemark. To consider the proposal, parliament established a committee in 1949 {{to look at the}} various proposals. After considering the impact <b>and</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the various railways that had been proposed in the 1940s, it recommended not building the Inner Trunk Line, as the expansion had been christened.|$|E

5|$|The number <b>and</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> {{contracts}} {{coming to}} the station significantly increased during World War II; the 1943–1944 budget {{was the first in}} which industry and government contracts exceeded the station's other income, most notably, its state appropriation. Director Vaughan had initially prepared the faculty for fewer incoming contracts as the Georgia General Assembly had cut the station's appropriation by 40%, but increased support from industry and government eventually compensated for lower state funding. World War II is credited with GTRI's entry into electronics, especially telecommunications and electronic warfare; the electronics and communications work that Director Rosselot attracted is still a mainstay of GTRI research. Two of the larger projects were a study on the propagation of electromagnetic waves, and United States Navy–sponsored radar research.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} was revived {{later in the}} year; the aim was changed to forging money to finance German intelligence operations. Instead of a specialist unit within the SD, prisoners from Nazi concentration camps were selected and sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp to work under SS Major Bernhard Krüger. The unit produced British notes until mid-1945; estimates vary of the number <b>and</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> notes printed, from £132.6 million up to £300 million. By the time the unit ceased production, they had perfected the artwork for US dollars, although the paper and serial numbers were still being analysed. The counterfeit money was laundered in exchange for money and other assets. Counterfeit notes from the operation were used to pay the Turkish agent Elyesa Bazna—code named Cicero—for his work in obtaining British secrets from the British ambassador in Ankara, and £100,000 from Operation Bernhard was used to obtain information that helped to free the Italian leader Benito Mussolini in the Gran Sasso raid in September 1943.|$|E
5|$|The price <b>and</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> a Zimbabwean {{banknote}} {{depend on}} various factors: the rarity, based on {{factors such as}} the name of capital city, how long it was printed, or the type of watermark; its condition, and the national situation at time of issue, such as shortages or hyperinflation. Common designs and variants such as the $100 note of 1995 (Pick no. 9) are usually valued at about $1 apiece, while rare varieties such as the $10 Salisbury error note (Pick no. 3b) and the Standard Chartered issues are valued at around $100 or more. Zimbabwean banknotes are usually sold by banknote dealers over the counter or on the internet, although the most valued types theoretically qualify for inclusion in auction.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the smaller}} ships from the convoy, an American {{merchant}} ship named Silenus, had separated from the main body in the storm and arrived at the Nicobar Islands. There she had encountered Caroline and the American captain had reported the location <b>and</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the convoy to Féretier. Setting all sail, Féretier took Caroline to the north-west, and sighted the convoy at 05:30, {{only a few days}} after leaving the Nicobar Islands. The British ships, under the loose command of John Dale in Streatham, originally mistook the French frigate for the missing Victor and it was not until another half-hour had passed that Dale realised the danger his ships were in. Ordering the Indiamen to form a line of battle, Dale placed his ship in the centre, with the small Lord Keith ahead and Europe behind. However, the lack of naval experience on the British ships resulted in the Indiamen sailing too far from one another in line, thus leaving them unable to provide effective mutual support.|$|E
