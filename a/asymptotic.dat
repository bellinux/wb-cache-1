Semiclassical microlocal analysis, propagation of singularities and related dynamics play crucial role. We start from the general theory, then consider Schrödinger and Dirac operators with the strong magnetic field and, finally, applications to the <b>asymptotics</b> of the ground state energy of heavy atoms and molecules {{with or without a}} magnetic field.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{classical}} {{limit of the}} ELPR/FK spin foam models by analyzing the large-distance <b>asymptotics</b> of the corresponding graviton propagators. This is done by examining the large-spin <b>asymptotics</b> of the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction which is peaked around a classical flat spatial geometry. By using the stationary phase method we determine the wavefunction <b>asymptotics.</b> The obtained <b>asymptotics</b> does not give the desired large-distance <b>asymptotics</b> for the corresponding graviton propagator. However, we show that the ELPR/FK vertex amplitude can be redefined such that the corresponding Hartle-Hawking wavefunction gives the desired <b>asymptotics</b> for the graviton propagator.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this article}} is to prove a Thom-Sebastiani theorem for the <b>asymptotics</b> of the fiber-integrals. This means that we {{describe}} the <b>asymptotics</b> of the fiber-integrals of the function f ⊕ g : (x,y) → f(x) + g(y) on (C^p×C^q, (0, 0)) in term of the <b>asymptotics</b> of the fiber-integrals of the holomorphic germs f : (C^p, 0) → (C, 0) and g : (C^q, 0) → (C, 0). This reduces to compute the <b>asymptotics</b> of a convolution Φ_*Ψ from the <b>asymptotics</b> of Φ and Ψ modulo smooth terms.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} problem of semiclassical limit of Loop Quantum Gravity theory defined by the new spin foam models. This is done by {{analyzing}} the large-spin <b>asymptotics</b> of the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction. By using the stationary phase method we determine the wavefunction <b>asymptotics,</b> which then determines the large-distance <b>asymptotics</b> of the corresponding graviton propagator. We show that the graviton propagator behaves as the inverse distance to the fourth power. Our result is {{a direct consequence of}} the large-spin <b>asymptotics</b> of the spin foam model vertex amplitude, and it is valid for all new spin foam models, since they all have the same type of the vertex amplitude <b>asymptotics.</b> We also find the type of the vertex amplitude <b>asymptotics</b> which gives the correct graviton propagator.

40|$|We {{study the}} <b>asymptotics</b> of large, {{moderate}} and normal {{deviations for the}} connected components of the sparse random graph by the method of stochastic processes. We obtain the logarithmic <b>asymptotics</b> of large deviations of the joint distribution {{of the number of}} connected components, of the sizes of the giant components, and of the numbers of the excess edges of the giant components. For the supercritical case, we obtain the <b>asymptotics</b> of normal deviations and the logarithmic <b>asymptotics</b> of large and moderate deviations of the joint distribution of the number of components, {{of the size of the}} largest component, and of the number of the excess edges of the largest component. For the critical case, we obtain the logarithmic <b>asymptotics</b> of moderate deviations of the joint distribution of the sizes of connected components and of the numbers of the excess edges. Some related <b>asymptotics</b> are also established. The proofs of the large and moderate deviation <b>asymptotics</b> employ methods of idempotent probability theory.
