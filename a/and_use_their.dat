During Oliver's childhood in the 1890s the town was home to 600 people. Today it is a ghost town.|$|E

5|$|The 61st Battalion was {{initially}} {{raised in the}} United Kingdom in February 1917 {{as part of the}} Australian Imperial Force (AIF) during the First World War in an effort to raise the 6th Division. However, following manpower shortages that occurred as a result of heavy losses amongst the AIF on the Western Front in 1917 and the failure of attempts to introduce conscription in Australia, it was decided to disband the division and its subordinate units in September 1917 <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> personnel to reinforce other units. As a result, the 61st Battalion was disbanded without seeing active service.|$|E

5|$|Wasps in {{the genus}} Sphecius are not habitually {{aggressive}} <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> venom mainly to paralyse cicadas which they take {{back to their}} nests to feed their young. The females catch around four or more cicadas for provisioning, place them in brood cells and lay eggs in the cells. S.grandis is endemic to Central America, Mexico and the Western United States, and is found at a higher mean altitude than other species of Sphecius. The western cicada killer males emerge earlier than females, but generally die after {{only a couple of}} days.|$|E
5|$|Introduced as Billie Jenkins's long-lost sister, she {{secretly}} collaborates {{with the}} demonic council {{known as the}} Triad with their plans to destroy the Charmed Ones.

Billie kills Christy in self-defense after being unable to convince her to understand the Halliwell sisters were good, and to return home with her. Throughout season eight, Christy is {{shown to be a}} powerful witch with a mastery of her powers of telepathy and pyrokinesis. She is also called the Key to the Ultimate Power due to her connection with Billie, who is prophesied to be the Ultimate Power. Christy is referenced in canonical Charmed material such as comic books and novels.|$|E
5|$|Jack jumper ants are {{primarily}} active {{during the day}} and live in open habitats, nesting in bushland, woodland and dry open forests, surrounded by gravel and sandy soil, which can be found in rural areas and are less common in urban areas. They prey on small insects <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> barbless stinger to kill other insects by injecting venom. Other ants and predatory invertebrates prey on the jack jumper. The average worker has a life expectancy of over one year. Workers are gamergates, allowing them to reproduce with drones, whether or not a queen is present in the colony. The ant {{is a part of the}} Myrmecia pilosula species complex; this ant and other members of the complex are known to have a single pair of chromosomes.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the family}} Theraphosidae, which {{includes}} tarantulas and baboon spiders, have urticating hairs on their abdomens <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> legs to flick them at attackers. These hairs are fine setae (bristles) with fragile bases and a row of barbs on the tip. The barbs cause intense irritation {{but there is no}} evidence that they carry any kind of venom. A few defend themselves against wasps by including networks of very robust threads in their webs, giving the spider time to flee while the wasps are struggling with the obstacles. The golden wheeling spider, Carparachne aureoflava, of the Namibian desert escapes parasitic wasps by flipping onto its side and cartwheeling down sand dunes.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Lost Light, {{attempting}} {{to track down}} Jhiaxus, is pulled off-course by a summons from the badly-wounded Metroplex, via a severed portion of his thumb the ship had previously encountered. Finding the ancient Autobot, and his companions Windblade, Chromia and Nautica on the ocean planet Hydrophena, the crew defends him and themselves against an army of Shockwave's Ammonite minions <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> ship's engines to give him enough of a power boost to teleport them all back home to Cybertron. They return as the Necrotitan {{is in the middle}} of razing Iacon at Shockwave's command; Megatron, having fallen in with Bumblebee, uses his space bridge to teleport Metroplex's thumb — revealed to contain another of Shockwave's ores — from the Lost Light back into its owner's hand, giving him the energy to defeat the Necrotitan and heal the plague.|$|E
5|$|The {{bedrock of}} E.V. Ramasamy’s {{principles}} and the movements {{that he started}} was rationalism. He thought that an insignificant minority in society was exploiting the majority {{and trying to keep}} it in a subordinate position forever. He wanted the exploited to sit up and think about their position, <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> reason to realise that they were being exploited by a handful of people. If they started thinking, they would realise that they were human beings like the rest, that birth did not and should not endow superiority over others and that they must awaken themselves and do everything possible to improve their own lot.|$|E

5|$|The {{inclusion}} of specific Final Fantasy characters {{was based on}} the opinions of both fans and staff. Another criterion for inclusion was whether the staff felt the characters would fit into the storyline and in the Kingdom Hearts universe. Initially, Nomura was hesitant to use characters he did not design, because he was unfamiliar with the backstory of such characters. For Kingdom Hearts II, he changed his mind after receiving pressure from his staff. Throughout the development of the games, Nomura has often left certain events and connections between characters unexplained until the release of future games. Nomura does this because he feels that games should have room for fans to speculate <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> imagination. He has stated that with speculation, even though a game gets old, people can still be happy with it.|$|E
5|$|Timmy and his fairies {{return to}} the Blue Moon via M.E.R.F.'s escape pod to {{retrieve}} the second wand. A weakened Turbo Thunder reveals the second wand only opens underneath a secret cave, which contains magical wands and the final part of the cave prophecy: to find the ice wand. The group returns to Fairy World with the wands to free the imprisoned fairies before everyone heads back to Earth. The fairies arrive <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> magic to remove the Earth's metal casing. Timmy heads into space with the Destructinator following him; the Destructinator attacks him, which sends him {{back down to the}} Earth, at its north polar region. After Timmy tricks the Destructinator into inhaling the explosives, he reveals that he stole the detonator remote from him back in space and uses it to obliterate him.|$|E
5|$|Wesley {{attacks the}} base using {{explosive}} rats (a tactic {{he learned from}} the Exterminator), killing surviving Fraternity assassins,including The Repairman and the Butcher (who he kills in a knife fight) in a massive shootout. Entering Sloan's office, he is surrounded by Fox, Gunsmith and the remaining assassins. Wesley discloses Sloan's deception, to which Sloan reveals that {{the names of those}} present had legitimately come up in the Loom, and that he had acted to protect them. He gives the members a choice: kill themselves, per the code, or kill Wesley <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> skills to control the world. As the others choose the latter, Fox curves a bullet around the room, choosing to follow the code and kill everyone, including herself, but not before throwing her gun to Wesley. Sloan escapes in the mayhem.|$|E
