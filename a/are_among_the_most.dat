Along with whales, they <b>are</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> completely aquatic of all air-breathing vertebrates. Among this group are species {{with some of the most}} potent venoms of all snakes. Some have gentle dispositions and bite only when provoked, but others are much more aggressive. Currently, 17genera are described as sea snakes, comprising 62 species.|$|E
5|$|Ctenophores {{are found}} in most marine environments: from polar waters to the tropics; near coasts and in mid-ocean; from the surface waters to the ocean depths. The best-understood are the genera Pleurobrachia, Beroe and Mnemiopsis, as these planktonic coastal forms <b>are</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> likely to be {{collected}} near shore.

5|$|Lawyers {{acting on}} behalf of Falun Gong {{practitioners}} have filed dozens of largely symbolic lawsuits around the world against Jiang Zemin, Luo Gan, and other Chinese officials alleging genocide and crimes against humanity. According to International Advocates for Justice, Falun Gong has filed the largest number of human rights lawsuits in the 21st century and the charges <b>are</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> severe international crimes defined by international criminal laws. As of 2006, 54 civil and criminal lawsuits were under way in 33 countries.|$|E

5|$|Mosaics <b>are</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{enduring}} of Roman decorative arts, and {{are found}} on the surfaces of floors and other architectural features such as walls, vaulted ceilings, and columns. The most common form is the tessellated mosaic, formed from uniform pieces (tesserae) of materials such as stone and glass. Mosaics were usually crafted on site, but sometimes assembled and shipped as ready-made panels. A mosaic workshop was led by the master artist (pictor) who worked with two grades of assistants.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia stings {{are very}} potent, and the venoms from these ants <b>are</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> toxic in the insect world. In Tasmania, 3% {{of the human}} {{population}} are allergic to the venom of M. pilosula and can suffer life-threatening anaphylactic reactions if stung; many human deaths have been recorded. People prone to severe allergic reactions can be treated with allergen immunotherapy (desensitisation).|$|E

In addition, Zoo Atlanta has a touch-screen computer where their two Sumatran orangutans play games.

Despite their popularity, Sebrights are often difficult to breed, and the inheritance of certain unique characteristics the breed carries has been studied scientifically. As a largely ornamental chicken, they lay tiny, white eggs and are not kept for meat production.|$|E

They have been observed to slide down snowbanks, apparently purely for fun. They even engage in games with other species, such as playing catch-me-if-you-can with wolves, otters and dogs. Common ravens are known for spectacular aerobatic displays, such as flying in loops or interlocking talons with each other in flight.|$|E

5|$|Volcanism in {{the region}} occurs because of the Southern Volcanic Zone and the Austral Volcanic Zone.

Though 90Y has a short half-life, it exists in secular equilibrium with its long-lived parent isotope, strontium-90 (90Sr) with a half-life of 29years.|$|E

5|$|Cookbooks, or more specifically, recipe collections, {{compiled}} in the Middle Ages <b>are</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important historical {{sources for}} medieval cuisine. The first cookbooks {{began to appear}} {{towards the end of}} the 13th century. The Liber de coquina, perhaps originating near Naples, and the Tractatus de modo preparandi have found a modern editor in Marianne Mulon, and a cookbook from Assisi found at Châlons-sur-Marne has been edited by Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat. Though it is assumed that they describe real dishes, food scholars do not believe they were used as cookbooks might be today, as a step-by-step guide through the cooking procedure that could be kept at hand while preparing a dish. Few in a kitchen, at those times, would have been able to read, and working texts have a low survival rate.|$|E
