5|$|After {{the first}} groups of {{personnel}} began arriving at Redbank, in south-east Queensland, {{in the middle}} of May, the battalion's headquarters moved to the camp and basic training commenced in June under instructors from the Australian Instructional Corps. In early July, the majority of the battalion was transported by train to Pinkenba, and from there to Darwin, in Australia's north, aboard the troopship Zealandia. Tasked with defending the port and its surrounds, the battalion was based around Vestey's meatworks near Mindil Beach, and {{in the months that followed}} was occupied with vital asset protection and <b>area</b> <b>defence</b> in between individual and collective training exercises. Personnel were joined by the majority of their vehicles, including 14 tracked Bren carriers in August, as well as a group of reinforcements. In October, elements of the battalion were used as stevedores during a wharf labourers' strike.|$|E
25|$|The {{threat of}} raids and attacks from Scots {{across the sea}} didn't end with the {{departure}} of the Romans, however, and as late as the 1550s, Scottish raiders were still attacking Mawbray and the surrounding communities. A system called the seawake – a night watch along the coast – was instituted, and Mawbray participated along with other coastal communities in the <b>area.</b> <b>Defence</b> against Scottish raids was also important to the Lord and Steward of Holm Cultram when planning the settlement of New Mawbray, today known as Newtown, in the same period.|$|E

During this campaign the squadron carried out a number of tasks including long-range patrols, flank protection and <b>area</b> <b>defence.</b> Later in the campaign the 2/10th were used to spearhead an amphibious assault landing at Dove Bay, east of Wewak before being used as line infantry during the final 'mopping up' stages of the campaign.

25|$|After being {{subjected}} to heavy aerial and artillery bombardment, the following day the battalion's commanding officer, Arthur Boyes, handed over command to Lieutenant Colonel Roland Oakes, formerly the second {{in command of the}} 2/19th Battalion. Boyes was called away to help organise the island's rear <b>area</b> <b>defence</b> and was subsequently given command of 'X' Battalion, a composite unit made up of reinforcements that had been separated from their units. Shortly after taking up this appointment, however, Boyes was killed along with a number of his men when the battalion was ambushed while attempting to fill a gap in the lines that had resulted from a Japanese breakthrough.|$|E
25|$|Under the <b>area</b> <b>defence</b> strategy, {{which had}} {{determined}} the army's organizational structure until 1993, {{the army was}} divided into three principal elements: the standing alert force (Bereitschaftstruppe) of active units, including the air division; the mobile militia (Mobile Landwehr), organized as eight mechanized reserve brigades to be deployed to key danger spots {{in the event of}} mobilization; and the stationary militia (Raumgebundene Landwehr) of twenty-six reserve infantry regiments organized for territorial defence. Both the mobile militia and the stationary militia were brought up to strength only in times of mobilization or during periods allotted for refresher training, usually three weeks in June. Training of conscripts was conducted by twenty-eight training and equipment-holding regiments (Landwehrstammregimenter). On mobilization, these regiments would disband, with their cadre reassigned to lead reserve units or form replacement regiments and battalions.|$|E

Following the appearance of Kirov, two more units, [...] and , were commissioned at four-year intervals. When Frunze was commissioned in 1984, it was seen to have a different weapons fit to Kirov, with the pair of single 100mm guns swapped for a twin 130mm turret, and the SS-N-14 Silex ASW missile system deleted in favour of adding eight SA-N-9 Gauntlet SAM launchers. In the event, none of the four ships of the class received a completely identical armament fit.|$|E
