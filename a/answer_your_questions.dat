We are not a fire-eating lot, you know. We are all for peace, and we believe {{we are going to have}} it. However, to <b>answer</b> <b>your</b> <b>questions</b> more closely, our obligations depend entirely upon the provocation giving cause for the war. If France and Russia provoked it in any way, we should remain neutral. If it were a war of sheer aggression from Germany against France, we might to a certain extent intervene. There is not one of us, however, who believes for a single moment that Germany would enter upon such a war." ...|$|E

6000|$|MY DEAR COLVIN, - I have {{to thank}} you this time for a very good letter, and will {{announce}} for the future, though I cannot now begin to put in practice, good intentions for our correspondence.

"Why you see, miss," [...] returns Mr. Bucket, {{bringing}} the finger into persuasive action--and such is his natural gallantry {{that he had}} almost said [...] "my dear"--"it ain't easy {{to answer those questions}} at the present moment.

6000|$|The king, {{eager to}} see such a {{wonderful}} thing, put off his execution to the next day, and sent him under a strong guard to his house.

The physician went up {{to the foot of the}} throne with a large book in his hand. He carried a basin, on which he spread the covering of the book, and presenting it to the king, said: [...] "Sire, take this book, and when my head is cut off, let it be placed in the basin on the covering of this book; as soon as it is there, the blood will cease to flow.

6000|$|... "If {{this were}} not a public place," [...] he said, still {{struggling}} with his anger, [...] "I'd punish you as you deserve, you impudent young cub. This young lady is my ward, and I have just brought her from a convent, where she has lived since she was three years old. She is strange and shy, of course, and I was perhaps wrong to bring her to a public place. I did it, however, out of kindness. I wanted her to enjoy herself, but I perhaps did not appreciate her sensitiveness {{and the fact that}} only a few days ago she parted with the friends with whom she has lived all her life. Now, sir," [...] he added, with a sneer upon his coarse lips, [...] "I have been compelled to <b>answer</b> <b>your</b> <b>questions</b> to avoid a disturbance in a public place; but I promise you that if you do not make yourself scarce in thirty seconds I will send for the manager." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{the second}} calumny I reply, that I {{received}} invitations, on my arrival in Wurzburg after my marriage, from every lady of distinguished social {{position in the}} town. After experience of the society thus offered to me, I own to having courteously declined subsequent invitations, and having devoted myself in retirement to my husband, to my infant child, and to such studies in literature and art as I had time to pursue. Gossip and scandal, with an eternal accompaniment of knitting, are not to my taste; and, while I strictly attend to domestic duties, I do not consider them as constituting, in connection with tea-drinking, the one great interest of a woman's life. I plead guilty to having been foolish enough to openly acknowledge these sentiments, and to having made bitter enemies everywhere as the necessary consequence. If this plain defense of myself fails to satisfy you, grant me an audience, and I will <b>answer</b> <b>your</b> <b>questions,</b> whatever they may be.|$|E

What should a man of my {{condition}} {{have to do with}} kings or pretenders? They have ruined my trade between them, and I care not whether King George or King James get the best of it, so that they do but make an end of it as soon as possible, and let me bring down my herds again. There's half a dozen butchers in the town who know me, and can speak for me. I have sold thousands of beasts to Master Tregold; but if this is the treatment an honest man meets with I ain't likely to sell them any more, for as soon as I am let free and get the money the constables have taken from me I am off to Glasgow and if I ever come south of the border again, may I be hung and quartered." ...|$|E
