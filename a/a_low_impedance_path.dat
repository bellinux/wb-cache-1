50|$|The {{function}} of this capacitor, {{known as a}} reservoir capacitor (or smoothing capacitor) is to lessen the variation in (or 'smooth') the rectified AC output voltage waveform from the bridge. There is still some variation, known as ripple. One explanation of 'smoothing' is that the capacitor provides <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>path</b> to the AC component of the output, reducing the AC voltage across, and AC current through, the resistive load. In less technical terms, any drop in the output voltage and current of the bridge tends to be cancelled by loss of charge in the capacitor. This charge flows out as additional current through the load. Thus the change of load current and voltage is reduced relative to what would occur without the capacitor. Increases of voltage correspondingly store excess charge in the capacitor, thus moderating the change in output voltage / current.|$|E

40|$|Based {{on one of}} {{the most}} {{researched}} multiinput dc-dc converter topologies for renewable energy systems, the multi-input dual-active bridge (DAB) dc-dc converter, the effectiveness of harmonic current absorption by the energy storage branch in fuel cell power conditioning systems is critically evaluated. The closed-loop output impedances of the converter under single-voltage-loop and dual-loop controls are derived and compared. It is shown that both control strategies can effectively reduce the converter's closed-loop output impedance, thus favoring the flow of harmonic current and prevent it from being drawn from either the fuel cell branch or the dc-link capacitor. However, as shown by experimental results, the use of conventional PI control alone still produces noticeable voltage ripple on the dc voltage bus due to harmonic current being drawn from the dc-link capacitor. Proportional-resonant control is proposed to effectively compensate for the dc-bus voltage variation by generating <b>an</b> extremely <b>low</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>path</b> for harmonic current flow at specific frequency.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that electrode amplifiers for myoelectric control require high input impedances, high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and mains frequency notch filters to cut out unwanted noise. Further, they generally offer {{a high degree of}} d. c. isolation. However, it is not generally recognised that the isolation between the skin ground electrode and the common lead may reduce at higher frequencies, and this can create a path for interfering common-mode signals. Harmonics of the mains frequency may be a particular concern as they are not rejected by the notch filter. Common-mode interference can adversely affect prostheses in electrically noisy environments, as long lead runs may act as antennas. Moreover, {{because of the nature of}} common-mode, screening the leads may have little effect. Measurements were made on a commercially available electrode amplifier to quantify the effect of injected common-mode signals with and without imbalance in the electrode contact impedances.

When in the high capacitance state, usually with low or no bias, they present <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>path</b> to RF, whereas when reverse biased their capacitance abruptly decreases and their RF impedance increases. Although they are still slightly conductive to the RF path, the attenuation they introduce decreases the unwanted signal to an acceptably low level. They are often used in pairs to switch between two different RF sources such as the VHF and UHF bands in a television tuner by supplying them with complementary bias voltages. The fourth device from the left in the picture {{at the head of}} this page is one such device.|$|E
50|$|In a {{switching}} subcircuit, switching noise must be suppressed. When a load {{is applied}} to a voltage source, it draws {{a certain amount of}} current. Typical power supply lines show inherent inductance, which results in a slower response to change in current. This in turn affects the transient voltage levels, since if the load current is zero the voltage across the load is zero as well. This sudden voltage drop would be seen by other loads as well if the inductance between two loads is much lower compared to the inductance between the loads and the output capacitors of the power supply. This is only temporary; the inductor ultimately saturates (that is the magnetic field around the conductor reaches its max), the voltage drop across the inductor reaches zero, and the supply voltage comes back to normal. But even a temporary reduction in voltage can disturb adjacent subcircuits. Decoupling caps provide instantaneous current jolt which helps maintain constant voltage across a subcircuit (or provide <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>path</b> for the transient currents; different descriptions are used by different industries).|$|E
50|$|The main coil is {{the outer}} part of the line trap which is made from {{stranded}} aluminum cable.

However, when the application of more than one layer is necessary, separation between layers is required to provide a cooling duct between them to avoid overheating. The cooling duct is created with spacer bars made out of epoxy resin and fiberglass. The coil carries rated continuous power frequency currents, therefore this is the power inductor in this system. It provides <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>path</b> for the electricity flow. Since the power flow is rather large at times, the coil used in a line trap must be large in terms of physical size. Hence, a line trap unit is inserted between the busbar and connection of coupling capacitor to the line. It is a parallel tuned circuit containing inductance and capacitance. It has low impedance for power frequency and high impedance to carrier frequency. This unit prevents the high frequency carrier signal from entering the neighboring line.|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical EngineeringWilliam KuhnWhen enough charges {{accumulate}} on two objects, the air dielectric {{between them}} breaks down {{to create a}} phenomenon known as electrostatic discharge (ESD). ESD is of great concern in the integrated circuit industry because of the damage it can cause to ICs. The problem will only become worse as process components become smaller. The three main types of ESD experienced by an IC are the human body model (HBM), the charged device model (CDM), and the machine model (MM). HBM ESD has the highest voltage while CDM ESD has the highest bandwidth and current of the three ESD types. Integrated circuits generally include ESD protection circuitry connected to their pads. Pads are {{the connection between the}} IC and the outside world, making them the required location for circuitry designed to route ESD events away from the IC's internal circuitry. The most basic protection pads use diodes connected from I/O to VDD and I/O to ground. A voltage clamp between VDD and ground is also necessary to protect against CDM and MM event types where the device may not yet have <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>impedance</b> supply <b>path</b> connected. The purpose of this research is to investigate the performance of ESD circuits and to develop a method for detecting the occurrence of an ESD event in an integrated circuit by utilizing IC fuses. The combination of IC fuses and detection circuitry designed to sense a broken fuse allows the IC to perform a built-in self-test (BIST) for ESD to identify compromised ICs, preventing manufacturers from shipping damaged circuits. Simulations are used to design an optimized protection circuit to complement the proposed ESD detection circuit. Optimization of an ESD pad circuit increases the turn-on speed of its voltage clamps and decreases the series resistance of its protection diodes. These improvements minimize the stress voltage placed on internal circuitry due to an ESD event. An ESD measurement setup is established and used to verify voltage clamp operation. This research also proposes an ESD detection circuit based on IC fuses, which fail during an ESD event.

40|$|A {{clinically}} viable brain-machine interface (BMI) {{requires a}} fully-implanted wireless neural acquisition system {{to limit the}} impediments of percutaneous connections. For an implanted system with an appreciable telemetry range, and where significant neural signal processing is performed continuously, a major obstacle for clinical application {{is the need for}} a power source. Existing battery technology and wireless power delivery systems have not addressed the need for a mid-range power supply, capable of 1 - 3 W delivery, that limits both induced noise and temperature rise. These factors are crucial for the succesful operation of a fully-implanted neural acquisition system. This work seeks to fill this void, and presents both a wireless power solution suitable for a neural recording device, and a system capable of real time monitoring of tissue temperature rise. During this research, a 2 W transcutaneous energy transfer system (TETS) was designed, built and tested. The TETS was designed specifically for a 96 -channel implanted neural data acquisition system, which requires continuous power. The major design constraints were tolerance to coil misalignment, low induced noise, and reasonable efficiency. The design of the primary circuit consists of an H-bridge switching network driving a planar spiral Litz wire primary coil. The primary also incoporates a novel circuit for detecting the presence of the secondary. The implanted secondary components include a complimentary planar spiral coil connected to a voltage doubling rectifier. The key approach to mitigating axial coil misalignments was the use of step-down switching regulators in the secondary. With this approach, link efficiency remained nearly constant at 40 %, for axial coil displacements of up to 2 cm. Noise in the recorded neural signals was minimized using two techniques. First, the 250 kHz operating frequency of the system was tuned, such that the aliased harmonics of the switching frequency lay above the bandwidth of the amplifier used for neural recording. The second approach was to limit the impact of induced displacement currents in the body by physically separating the recording front end from the power supply components. A large titanium enclosure was used to house some of the secondary electronics, and provided <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>impedance</b> return <b>path</b> for further reduction of current-induced noise. Limiting the temperature rise of internal components was also a critical design constraint. The need for real time temperature information led to the design of a six channel temperature measurement system and incorporation of the temperature data into the acquisition system data transmission scheme. This system consisted of bead thermistor temperature transducers, and an off-the-shelf microcontroller with a built-in instrumentation amplifier. The TETS and temperature system was fully tested in an ovine model during several acute studies. Recorded temperature rise was limited to approximately 5. 5 ° C when the system was implanted at an adequate depth in muscle. The TETS was able to successfully power the 2 W neural acquisition system during a data processing task. Received rectified voltage in the secondary ranged from 14. 86 V to 20. 2 V, while link efficiency remained virtually constant. Acquired neural data was examined for TETS switching noise. The measured RMS noise increased by less than 1 &mu V, averaged over several experiments. These results demonstrate the first mid-range TETS solution for powering a fully implanted neural acquisition system. Dissertatio...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{tendency}} of faster data rates and lower power supply voltage in the integrated circuit (IC) design, Simultaneously Switching Noise (SSN) and ground bounce become serious concerns for designers and testers. This noise can {{be a source of}} electromagnetic interference (EMI). It propagates through the power/ground planes on the printed circuit board (PCB) and it can couple to the nearby circuit affecting the performance of other devices. This noise results in antenna currents into connected cables and it can also increase the edge radiation from the PCB. In mixed signal systems it leads to sensitivity degradation or radiofrequency (RF) interference issues of radio-frequency circuits. This research work is focused on how to mitigate noise and reduce EMI by means of structuring the power plane of a PCB with Electromagnetic Band Gap (EBG) structures. A novel concept for ultra-wide-bandwidth suppression of SSN is proposed and implemented. This method consists of applying EBG cells with different stop bands creating noise isolation over a wide frequency region. The thesis starts with a general description of Power Distribution Network (PDN) of a PCB. It discusses the main challenges modern PCB designers are facing. Power and ground planes which are symmetric in shape and size create a resonating waveguide structure, an ideal path for SSN propagation. The mechanism of noise generation and propagation through the PDN and general approach of PDN noise reduction is discussed. Typically used methods include placement of EMI passives such as decoupling capacitors and ferrite beads and via stitching. The drawback of these methods is the limited frequency bandwidth they can cover, and the need to integrate additional components. Reduction of SSN noise by means of EBG was intensively studied over the last decades. However, most of the structures are effective only in a limited frequency band. Often they are embedded in a PCB as a separate layer or require extra vias which increase the manufacturing cost. In this work a new type of planar EBG structures was proposed as a means to avoid the generation and propagation of common-mode currents due to SSN in the power plane of PCBs, and thereby reducing their radiated emissions. The EBG also have beneficial effects on the differential-mode noise in PDN due to the SSN. To guide the design of EBGs for SSN reduction, several modelling techniques of the EBG structures based on results achieved with full-wave electromagnetic simulations by means of CST Microwave Studio and transmission matrix analysis are used. The dispersion diagram of the proposed EBG structure is validated by insertion loss measurements of the prototype boards. It was shown that a power plane structure is needed only locally for circuitry decoupling by creating <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>impedance</b> current <b>path.</b> The effect of different PDN designs such as power plane, power track and 2 single-cell EBG structures and different sized cells EBG on the noise reduction in PCB with active components was investigated. Some high permittivity materials were implemented as a PCB substrate to create a large power-ground plane capacitance, and its effectiveness to reduce EMI was investigated. Many researchers have investigated the effect of EBG using passive elements only. In this thesis not only the passive elements behaviour is discussed, but a design with active components was used too. The reduction in radiated electromagnetic fields and common mode currents of PCB with active components and various PDNs was studied. An equivalent circuit of active boards with a PDN was created with a SPICE circuit simulator. The proposed new EBG structure behaves as <b>a</b> wideband <b>low</b> pass filter reducing EMI. The key result of the work presented in this thesis is that by applying EBG structured power plane and supporting each individual electronic module on the board by its own power patch interconnected by - relatively- thin traces, instead of standard power ground plane couples which are identical and parallel to each other, can reduce SSN, common mode noise and radiated emission of the PCB...|$|R
