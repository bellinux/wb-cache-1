40|$|Objective: Identification of micro RNAs (miRNAs) as a {{biomarker}} {{to diagnose}} and treat <b>auto</b> <b>immune</b> <b>diseases</b> {{is a challenge}} {{in the era of}} post genomics and the ability to apply an accurate computational approach leads to the initiation of discovering novel biomarkers. Methods: Initially we have identified the list of genes from a database which contain a catalog of Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) and then we have identified the predicted miRNAs from TargetScan. Finally we have found the connectivity map between the gene and validated miRNA target from miRmap and the number of binding sites were analyzed for each pair (gene-miRNA). Results: We have applied the above mentioned approach to Psoriasis. In case of Psoriasis, 15 distinct genes are present in GWAS and among them; TRAF 3 IP 2, KCNH 7, CAST, NOS 2, STAT 2, IL 23 R and CoG 6 contain predicted miRNAs in TargetScan. Finally, the number of mRNA binding sites were analyzed for miRNAs obtained from TargetScan and it has been found that the binding of hsa-miR- 520 d- 5 p and hsa-miR- 524 - 5 p with the mRNA of TRAF 3 IP 2 is more stable than the binding of other miRNAs with their respective genes on the basis of binding site analysis and hence there is a maximum probability for the utilization of hsa-miR- 520 d- 5 p and hsa-miR- 524 - 5 p as a biomarker for Psoriasis.

40|$|The {{individual}} role of pathogen-binding Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and antibody-binding Fc receptors (FcRs) during pathogenic infections {{has been}} studied extensively. However, combined activation of these different receptor classes has received little attention, {{even though they are}} triggered simultaneously when immune cells bind antibody-opsonized pathogens. In the last few years, it has become evident that joined activation of TLRs and FcRs substantially tailors inflammatory immune responses, which is an efficient and controlled mechanism of the host to act upon invading pathogens. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of cross-talk between different TLRs and FcRs and the resulting inflammatory immune responses. Furthermore, we propose how chronic activation via this cross-talk might be detrimental in inflammatory (<b>auto)</b> <b>immune</b> <b>diseases.</b> We conclude with the potential exploitation of the interplay between TLRs and FcRs for monoclonal antibody therapy to target tumors.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is {{a commonly}} occurring systemic inflammatory <b>auto</b> <b>immune</b> <b>disease</b> and {{is believed to}} be associated with genetic factors. The innate immune complement protein Mannose binding lectin (MBL) and their MBL 2 genetic variants are associated with different infectious and autoimmune diseases. METHODS: In a Brazilian cohort, we aim to associate the functional role of circulating MBL serum levels and MBL 2 variants in clinically classified patients (nâ€Š=â€Š 196) with rheumatoid arthritis including their relatives (nâ€Š=â€Š 200) and ethnicity matched healthy controls (nâ€Š=â€Š 200). MBL serum levels were measured by ELISA and functional MBL 2 variants were genotyped by direct sequencing. RESULTS: The exon 1 + 54 MBL 2 *B variant was significantly associated with an increased risk and the reconstructed haplotype MBL 2 *LYPB was associated with RA susceptibility. Circulating serum MBL levels were observed significantly lower in RA patients compared to their relatives and controls. No significant contribution of MBL levels were observed with respect to functional class, age at disease onset, disease duration and/or other clinical parameters such as nodules, secondary SjÃ¶gren syndrome, anti-CCP and rheumatoid factor. Differential distribution of serum MBL levels with functional MBL 2 variants was observed in respective RA patients and their relatives.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the pathofysiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in the <b>auto</b> <b>immune</b> <b>disease</b> Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. To this end MRI abnormalities in SLE patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms were compared with clinical symptoms and serological markers of disease. This thesis shows that immune abnormalities have an influence on the central nervous system in SLE (chapter 3 & 4). Reversible abnormalities in quantitative brain MRI in NPSLE are associated with clinical symptoms (chapter 2). These abnormalities are associated with neuroimaging features which may be interpreted as reversible axonal and/ or neuronal dysfunction (chapter 5). In line with this, severe ischemia does not appear {{to play a major role}} in NPSLE patients without obvious infarction on conventional MRI (chapter 6). Chapter 3 suggests that the influence of auto-immune antibodies is similar to the influence of auto-immune antibodies found in mouse models of NPLSE affecting specific locations of the brain. Using advanced MRI techniques and statistical analysis in chapter 7 suggests that the influence of auto-antibodies in human NPSLE also extends to white matter. Hopefully, these findings will facilitate earlier detection and treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in SLE. Promotores: M. A. van Buchem, T. W. J.

In a longitudinal cohort follow-up study, 131 emergency penetrating grafts were studied. Grafts were performed {{with a pool}} of organ-cultured donor corneas designated for emergency grafting and prepared for immediate use with all safety tests performed. Assignation criteria were: corneas with a small superficial stromal opacity but meeting all selection criteria for PKP tissue and corneas without stromal opacity, but an endothelial cell density from 1800 to 2300 cells/mm(2) or mild polymegathism or pleomorphism. Cox multivariate regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival and log rank test were applied. Of the 131 keratoplasties, 115 could be followed. One eye was lost during surgery because of an expulsive bleeding. In 15 cases, a conjunctival transplantation finished off the penetrating graft. Corneal graft survival was not {{significantly related to the}} presence of PKP quality of the donor endothelium, neither with a cloudy graft nor with endothelial decompensation as the cause of failure.

40|$|Leishmaniasis is a {{neglected}} disease in tropical countries. Clinical and laboratory features may mimic <b>auto</b> <b>immune</b> <b>diseases</b> {{and this can}} complicate the Leishmania diagnosis. Due to our previous investigation for false anti-CCP 2 reactivity in Leishmania-infected subjects and our interest in immunity against the joint-specific collagen type II (CII) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) we investigated the same cohort for anti-CII antibodies. We found elevated anti-CII reactivity in Leishmania-infected patients as compared to controls. When anti-CII OD values were compared with BSA-blocked control plates we found higher reactivity against BSA than in CII-coated plates in many Leishmania-infected patients. The percentage of such false positive anti-CII reactions increased with inflammatory activity, and was found in almost all Leishmania patients with highly active inflammatory disease, but was as low in Sudanese healthy controls as well as among Swedish RA patients. The correlation coefficients between false positive anti-CII and anti-CCP 2 measured with a commercial ELISA were highest for patients with the most inflammatory disease but non-significant for Sudanese controls and Swedish RA patients, arguing that our findings may have general implications for ELISA measurements in leishmaniasis.

40|$|The {{importance}} of an (<b>auto)</b> <b>immune</b> response in atherogenesis {{is becoming increasingly}} well understood. IL- 17 A-expressing T cells modulate immune cell trafficking, initiating inflammation and cytokine production in (<b>auto)</b> <b>immune</b> <b>diseases.</b> In human carotid artery plaques, we previously showed the presence of IL- 17 A-producing T cells and IL- 23; however, IL- 17 A effects on atherogenesis have not been studied. Aortic root sections from 8 -wk-old apolipoprotein E-deficient mice fed a standard chow diet were examined after 12 wk for lesion area, plaque composition, cellular infiltration, cytokine expression, and apoptosis. The treatment group (n = 3 D 15) received anti-IL- 17 A Ab and the controls (n = 3 D 10) received irrelevant Abs. Inhibition of IL- 17 A markedly reduced atherosclerotic lesion area (p < 0. 001), maximal stenosis (p < 0. 001), and vulnerability of the lesion. IL- 17 A mAb-treated mice showed reduced cellular infiltration, down-regulation of activation markers on endothelium and immune cells (e. g., VCAM- 1), and reduced cytokine/chemokine secretion (e. g., IL 6, TNFa, CCL 5). To investigate possible mechanisms, different atherogenic cell types (e. g., macrophages, dendritic cells, HUVECs, vascular smooth muscle cells) were stimulated with IL- 17 A in addition to TNF-a, IFN-?, or LPS to induce cellular activation or apoptosis in vitro. Stimulation with IL- 17 A induced proinflammatory changes in several atherogenic cell types and apoptotic cell death in murine cells. Functional blockade of IL- 17 A reduces atherosclerotic lesion development and decreases plaque vulnerability, cellular infiltration, and tissue activation in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. The present data support a pathogenic role of IL- 17 A {{in the development of}} atherosclerosis by way of its widespread proinflammatory and proapoptotic effects on atherogenic cells...|$|R

We frequently detected anti-FcepsilonRIalpha autoAbs in pemphigus vulgaris (PV, 39 %), dermatomyositis (DM, 36 %), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, 20 %), and bullous pemphigoid (BP, 13 %).
