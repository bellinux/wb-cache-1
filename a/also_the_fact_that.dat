5|$|Le Père Goriot (Old Father Goriot, 1835) was {{his next}} success, in which Balzac transposes {{the story of}} King Lear to 1820s Paris in order to rage at a society bereft of all love save the love of money. The {{centrality}} of a father in this novel matches Balzac's own position—not only as mentor to his troubled young secretary, Jules Sandeau, but <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he had fathered a child, Marie-Caroline Du Fresnay, with his otherwise-married lover, Maria Du Fresnay, who had been his source of inspiration for Eugénie Grandet.|$|E
25|$|Proponents {{argue that}} {{maintaining}} one entity for food service lowers {{costs for the}} University, which in turn lowers costs for students. <b>Also,</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> food service workers are not UC employees further lowers costs for the university. Furthermore, UCI notes the large investment Aramark is making is in dining infrastructure, which will outlast its current contract and support UCI's long-range development plan.|$|E
25|$|Since {{dry socket}} occurs {{exclusively}} following a dental extraction, {{it could be}} considered both a complication and an iatrogenic condition, {{but this does not}} take into account both the reason why the tooth required extraction (i.e., extraction may have been unavoidable due to significant pain and infection) and <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> many dry sockets are the result of poor compliance with postoperative instructions, notably refraining from smoking in the days immediately after the procedure.|$|E

50|$|Anandavardhana defines viśayah as 'habitat', area, sphere or genre; Abhinavagupta defines it as a {{particular}} aggregate (sañghā-ta). In Sanskrit Literature, {{it refers to}} the area or range of operation, or objects operated upon, and therefore means the area in which the words can serve any purpose as informing us of anything and includes their expressed, indicated, and suggested meanings (objects) and <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> can be inferred from using words.|$|R
25|$|In the October 2014 Ukrainian {{parliamentary}} election the party won constituency 6 seats; the party came 0,29% short {{to overcome the}} 5% threshold to win seats on the nationwide list. The parties election results thus halved compared with the 2012 election because of negative assessments of {{the activities of the}} local governments that included Svoboda members. In its former stronghold Lviv Oblast Svoboda won no constituencies. <b>Also</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> in this election the party {{was not the only one}} using radically patriotic, anti-communist and anti-Russian slogans undermined its election outcome.|$|E
25|$|This {{version of}} Faraday's law {{strictly}} holds {{only when the}} closed circuit is a loop of infinitely thin wire, and is invalid in other circumstances. It {{ignores the fact that}} Faraday's law is defined by the total, not partial, derivative of magnetic flux and <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> EMF is not necessarily confined to a closed path but may also have radial components as discussed below. A different version, the Maxwell–Faraday equation (discussed below), is valid in all circumstances, and when used in conjunction with the Lorentz force law it is consistent with correct application of Faraday's law.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, James Cronin, Val Fitch and {{coworkers}} provided clear evidence from kaon decay that CP-symmetry could be broken. This work won them the 1980 Nobel Prize. This discovery showed that weak interactions violate {{not only the}} charge-conjugation symmetry C between particles and antiparticles and the P or parity, but also their combination. The discovery shocked particle physics {{and opened the door}} to questions still at the core of particle physics and of cosmology today. The lack of an exact CP-symmetry, but <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it is so nearly a symmetry, created a great puzzle.|$|E

25|$|Hearing is not {{a purely}} {{mechanical}} phenomenon of wave propagation, but is also a sensory and perceptual event; in other words, when a person hears something, that something arrives at the ear as a mechanical sound wave traveling through the air, but within the ear it is transformed into neural action potentials. These nerve pulses then travel to the brain where they are perceived. Hence, in many problems in acoustics, such as for audio processing, it is advantageous {{to take into account}} not just the mechanics of the environment, but <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> both the ear and the brain are involved in a person’s listening experience.|$|E
25|$|Seduction of the Innocent also {{analyzed}} the advertisements {{that appeared in}} 1950s comic books and the commercial context in which these publications existed. Wertham objected to not only {{the violence in the}} stories but <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> air rifles and knives were advertised alongside them. Wertham claimed that retailers {{who did not want to}} sell material with which they were uncomfortable, such as horror comics, were essentially held to ransom by the distributors. According to Wertham, news vendors were told by the distributors that if they did not sell the objectionable comic books, they would not be allowed to sell any of the other publications being distributed.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the government's assurances that seats will be increased in the institutes so that the general category students don't get affected, another point raised against reservation {{is that most of}} the seats reserved for SC/ST candidates remain empty and hence any more reservation is a waste of resources. A major concern among them is <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> implementing reservation in institutes of higher education would be difficult unless the quality of faculty in them is diluted. They back this point by the fact that all IITs and IIMs are facing shortage of faculty and hence increasing the seats will lead to deterioration of education. For example, while IIT Kharagpur requires 667 faculties, it currently has only 470. Similarly, IIT Bombay has just 401 faculties as against the required 529.|$|E

25|$|In 1917 Siam {{declared}} war on German Empire and Austria-Hungary, mainly to gain favour with the British and the French. Siam's token participation in World War I secured it {{a seat at the}} Versailles Peace Conference, and Foreign Minister Devawongse used this opportunity to argue for the repeal of the 19th century unequal treaties and the restoration of full Siamese sovereignty. The United States obliged in 1920, while France and Britain delayed until 1925. This victory gained the king some popularity, but it was soon undercut by discontent over other issues, such as his extravagance, which became more noticeable when a sharp postwar recession hit Siam in 1919. There was <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the king had no son. He obviously preferred the company of men to women (a matter which of itself did not much concern Siamese opinion, but which did undermine the stability of the monarchy due to the absence of heirs).|$|E
25|$|Lamptey joined Venezia in Italy {{and later}} Unión de Santa Fe in Argentina. There, {{he and his}} wife had their third child, Diego. But soon, Diego died of a rare disease. A major {{emotional}} blow was <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Lamptey wanted to bury his son in Ghana, but the authorities declined. Heartbroken, Lamptey temporarily gave up football. After unsuccessful stints at Ankaragücü and União Leiria, Lamptey got himself a new German player agent who transferred him to SpVgg Greuther Fürth. However, Lamptey and his wife were unhappy there, unable to live through the culture shock in Germany. Lamptey was not entirely unsuccessful, being a reliable backup, but was found too fragile for the rough Second Bundesliga. He was also reportedly ignored by his German colleagues, and once, a colleague flat out refused to sleep in the same hotel room as him. This blatant racism shocked Lamptey, but even worse was the fact that his child Lisa also died soon after birth. Also Lamptey's second dead child was buried abroad, in Germany. The Lampteys soon left for Asia.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, the 2nd Circuit Federal Court in New York {{issued a}} {{decision}} in the famous Coca-Cola case. Coca-Cola took over assets of Jews expelled from Egypt in the 1950s and was sued in New York. Bigio v. Coca-Cola Company, 448 F.3d 176 (2d Cir. 2006), certiorari to Sup. Ct. denied. In that case, the plaintiffs were Canadians and non‐residents of New York. The court denied Coca-Cola’s FNC motion and the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari. The 2nd Circuit stated {{that the fact that}} the New York court would need to apply “modest application” of Egyptian law was not a problem because “courts of this Circuit are regularly called upon to interpret foreign law without thereby offending the principles of international comity”. <b>Also,</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> there were witnesses abroad was not a problem either. They could be flown into the U.S. or Letters Rogatory could be issued to the Egyptian courts to collect their testimony. Further, it was held that in an FNC scenario, a court applies the balance of conveniences, but preference (and weight) must be given to the fact that plaintiffs chose this particular forum for “legitimate reasons”. The fact that plaintiffs could sue in Canada was not relevant because Coca-Cola was a U.S. company and it was “perfectly reasonable to sue in the US”.|$|E

500|$|Due to falling crime rates, {{fewer people}} {{felt the need}} to carry a firearm for {{protection}} after 2000. This trend however changed in 2015 following the European migrant crisis and November 2015 Paris attacks. Gun advocacy groups argue that {{there is no point in}} banning guns because criminals will get guns no matter how tight the law is. At the same time, however, the rules are deemed to be restrictive enough to prevent criminals from easily obtaining firearms, while allowing upstanding citizens to own them for personal protection. For example, in 2010, a Norwegian terrorist, incited by reports of British newspapers describing Prague as [...] "being the most important transit site point for illicit weapons in Europe", found himself unable to obtain any in the country when preparing for the 2011 Norway attacks. Similarly, a Polish terrorist obtained guns illegally in 1200km distant Belgium, despite living mere 70km from the Czech border. <b>Also,</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Czech Republic has a strong tradition in firearms manufacturing and competition shooting contributes to generally moderate attitude to gun control.|$|E

500|$|During the [...] and [...] seasons, Sidle {{seems to}} be on a {{downward}} spiral as her memories of childhood resurface, with cases becoming more difficult for her emotionally. <b>Also,</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Grissom decided to promote Nick Stokes instead of Sidle, did not help. Season Four concludes with Sidle being stopped by a traffic cop. Although she is driving under the influence, she is not charged, but Grissom, as her supervisor, is informed of her arrest. He arrives at the station to bring her home, and finally seems to notice her emotional state. Later, in , she loses her temper with a domestic abuse suspect and then argues with supervisors Catherine Willows and Conrad Ecklie, which results in her suspension. Following this incident, she admits to Grissom that she has a problem with authority, has chosen emotionally unavailable men (like Grissom), and has a self-destructive streak. Sidle then opens up to him and reveals her family story; it is during this season that she apparently starts bonding with Grissom. During the subsequent seasons ( [...] and [...] ), after it is revealed that they are in a relationship, she appears to be happier and on a more even keel.|$|E
500|$|Tim Sendra of Allmusic {{gave the}} album {{three out of}} five stars review, and said the album had the [...] "cheesy drum machines, samples, and off-kilter lyric {{approach}} that make [...] "Jerk" [...] so good", [...] "the duo stick to the template , considering {{the uniqueness of the}} sound they've created and <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it's a debut record made by teenagers, and an impressive and unfailingly fun debut at that." [...] The review goes on to point out that [...] "the reliance on the [...] "Jerk" [...] sound can be a little monotonous, there are enough variations along the way to keep things interesting." [...] He also says [...] "The duo's flow is not incredible but they spit convincingly. If you were looking for undisputedly pop-rap with a fresh sound and a light lyrical touch, the New Boyz debut is a fine destination." [...] XXL said that the album delivered [...] "unexpected lyrical talent" [...] but that it lacked [...] "sonic variety". The review also {{goes on to say that}} the album [...] "is no hip-hop classic, but rather the breath of fresh air rap needs." [...] Jeff Weiss of The Los Angeles Times gave the album three stars, commenting that the album [...] "is a catchy and charismatic debut that should engender pleasant teen nostalgia in anyone old enough to vote and help explain why for the last six months, the kids have been saying out with the old, in with the New Boyz.". The review also said that the album [...] "successfully strikes a balance between introducing a new sound (the minimalist bass-heavy bounce of jerk music) and style (skinny jeans, Vans and [...] "colors that ain’t even on the rainbow"), with traditional teenage themes (girls, the desire for self-expression, adults who don’t understand, girls). The result is a West Coast antidote to the South’s veritable monopoly on homeroom rap—a relentlessly breezy and fun ride through the lives of a pair of class clowns bent on enjoying the face cards that fate dealt." [...] The Selby Times said that the album [...] "is about as happening as it gets for teenage music with an attitude, even if it makes adults' eyes roll in disgust." [...] Wendy Roby of BBC said that, [...] "But overall their sheer chutzpah wins you over – and with its day-glo tongue wedged so very firmly in its cheek, Skinny Jeanz and a Mic is hard to resist." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the album [...] "one of the year’s most charming rap debuts, and certainly the least expected." [...] In a separate review, he named the album the sixth best album of the year, commenting, [...] "Emerging from Southern California’s jerk scene, this teenage duo made an album that’s appealingly young, simultaneously wide-eyed and knowingly lewd." [...] DJBooth.net's Nathan Slavik was less positive, predicting that the album would be [...] "the last time we hear from the New Boyz." ...|$|E
