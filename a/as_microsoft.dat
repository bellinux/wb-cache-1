5|$|Windows 95 was {{released}} without {{a web browser}} <b>as</b> <b>Microsoft</b> had not yet developed one. The success of the web caught them by surprise and they subsequently approached Spyglass to license their browser as Internet Explorer. Spyglass went on to later dispute {{the terms of the}} agreement, <b>as</b> <b>Microsoft</b> was to pay a royalty for every copy sold. However, Microsoft sold no copies of Internet Explorer, choosing instead to bundle it for free with the operating system.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Microsoft began {{introducing}} {{its most}} prominent office products. Microsoft Works, an integrated office program which combined features typically {{found in a}} word processor, spreadsheet, database and other office applications, saw its first release as an application for the Apple Macintosh {{towards the end of}} 1986. Microsoft Works would later be sold with other Microsoft products including Microsoft Word and Microsoft Bookshelf, a reference collection introduced in 1987 that was the company's first CD-ROM product. Later, on August 8, 1989, Microsoft introduced its most successful office product, Microsoft Office. Unlike the model of Microsoft Works, Microsoft Office was a bundle of separate office productivity applications, such <b>as</b> <b>Microsoft</b> Word, Microsoft Excel and so forth. While Microsoft Word and Microsoft Office were mostly developed internally, Microsoft also continued its trend of rebranding products from other companies, such <b>as</b> <b>Microsoft</b> SQL Server on January 13, 1988, a relational database management system for companies that was based on technology licensed from Sybase.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{acquired}} Seattle-based Visio Corporation on January 7, 2000 for $1.375 billion. Visio, {{a software}} company, {{was founded in}} 1990 as Axon Corporation, and had its initial public offering in November 1995. The company developed the diagramming application software, Visio, which was integrated into Microsoft's product line <b>as</b> <b>Microsoft</b> Visio after its acquisition.|$|E

5|$|CampusNetwork, an on-campus social {{networking}} site called Campus Network that preceded Facebook, was created and popularized by Columbia engineering student Adam Goldberg in 2003. Mark Zuckerberg later asked Goldberg {{to join him in}} Palo Alto to work on Facebook, but Goldberg declined the offer. The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science offers a minor in Technical Entrepreneurship through its Center for Technology, Innovation, and Community Engagement. SEAS' entrepreneurship activities focus on community building initiatives in New York and worldwide, made possible through partners such <b>as</b> <b>Microsoft</b> Corporation.|$|E
5|$|Flight Unlimited was {{the first}} self-published game {{released}} by Looking Glass Technologies. It was intended to establish the company as a video game publisher and to compete with flight simulator franchises such <b>as</b> <b>Microsoft</b> Flight Simulator. Project leader Seamus Blackley, a particle physicist and amateur pilot, conceived the game in 1992. He felt that other flight simulators failed to convey the experience of real flight, and he reacted by coding a simulated atmosphere for Flight Unlimited based on real-time computational fluid dynamics. Aerobatic pilot Michael Goulian endorsed the game and assisted the team in making it more true to life.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft has {{integrated}} Cortana into numerous {{products such}} <b>as</b> <b>Microsoft</b> Edge, the browser bundled with Windows 10. Microsoft's Cortana assistant is deeply integrated into its Edge browser. Cortana can find opening-hours when on restaurant sites, show retail coupons for websites, or show weather {{information in the}} address bar. At the Worldwide Partners Conference 2015 Microsoft demonstrated Cortana integration with upcoming products such as GigJam. Conversely, Microsoft announced in late April 2016 that it would block anything other than Bing and Edge from being used to complete Cortana searches, again raising questions of anticompetitive behavior by the company.|$|E
50|$|The eBox {{is planned}} to be a controller-less video game console, coming {{prepackaged}} with similar video tracking features <b>as</b> <b>Microsoft's</b> Kinect for the Xbox 360.|$|R

5|$|This {{initial release}} had {{multiple}} built-in applications, {{many of them}} similarly branded to match their desktop counterparts; such <b>as</b> <b>Microsoft</b> Reader, Microsoft Money, Pocket Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player. A version of Microsoft Office called Pocket Office was also bundled and included Pocket Word, Pocket Excel and Pocket Outlook. Notes, a note-taking app saw its first release and would be supported by most later versions of Windows Mobile. Intelligent character recognition support allowed Notes to distinguish styles of handwriting to be learned by the OS during processing to improve accuracy and recognition levels.|$|E
5|$|The game {{originally}} was envisioned as {{a sequel to}} Remedy's previous game, Alan Wake. The game's focus was shifted to time travel, <b>as</b> <b>Microsoft</b> wanted a new intellectual property with interactive storytelling. The team consulted scientists while creating the fictional science in this game. While the video game portion was developed internally by Remedy and directed by studio veteran Sam Lake, the TV side of the game was developed by Lifeboat Productions and directed by Ben Ketai. Shawn Ashmore, Aidan Gillen and Lance Reddick portrayed important roles in the game. The game uses a new engine developed by Remedy, the Northlight engine, and a technology called Digital Molecular Matter.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{releases}} of System 6 were unstable; many third party software developers {{did not receive}} copies before its release, resulting in widespread compatibility problems. At first, many common software programs such <b>as</b> <b>Microsoft</b> Excel, Microsoft Works and 4th Dimension were not fully compatible with System 6. There were also software bugs in the Color Manager, Script Manager, and Sound Manager extension files. Apple announced that 66 bugs were fixed when the 6.0.1 update was released in September 1988. However, a major bug involving text spacing of screen fonts was found in 6.0.1 after distribution began. This led to the quick release of 6.0.2, which solved this problem. Some customers waited longer until moving to System 6 because of the poor reputation already gained.|$|E
50|$|Programming {{language}} evolution continues, in both {{industry and}} research. Current directions include security and reliability verification, {{new kinds of}} modularity (mixins, delegates, aspects), and database integration such <b>as</b> <b>Microsoft's</b> LINQ.|$|R

5|$|Upon {{its initial}} release in Japanese arcades, {{reception}} was mixed. Treasure staff explained {{this was due}} to players expecting a more standard shooter offering but instead being greeted with a different game system that featured more puzzle-like elements rather than the twitch gameplay of bullet-dodging. In 2002, Ikaruga was ported to the Dreamcast in Japan and began to grow a cult following from import gamers worldwide. It was later released in the West in 2003 on the GameCube, receiving positive reviews. Critics praised the graphics as well as the art and sound design. Some criticism was directed towards its difficulty. Most critics felt the unique game design choices were innovative, while some believed they stifled many of the classic shooter elements. Ikaruga was later ported to the Xbox 360 as well <b>as</b> <b>Microsoft</b> Windows. In retrospect, Ikaruga is often {{regarded as one of the}} best shoot 'em ups of all time and one of Treasure's greatest works.|$|E

25|$|Powerful macros used in word {{processor}} applications, such <b>as</b> <b>Microsoft</b> Word, presented a risk. Virus writers {{could use the}} macros to write viruses embedded within documents. This meant that computers could now also be at risk from infection by opening documents with hidden attached macros.|$|E
