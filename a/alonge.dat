Using kerosene lanterns, he developed the glass plate negatives at night and contact printed the images on gaslight paper. Reading instruction booklets from Kodak and Ilford, he taught himself to mix his own chemicals and use sunlight to develop his prints. In 1940, <b>Alonge</b> began to retouch, sepia tone, and hand-color his photographs. When electricity came to Benin in 1945, {{he was able to}} take studio portraits and develop his photos indoors.

25|$|Alonge's {{photography}} preserves {{an important}} historical record of Benin {{arts and culture}} during the periods of British colonial rule and the transition to Nigerian independence during the 1950s and 1960s. The National Museum of African Art exhibited Alonge's work beginning in September 2014, displaying some of his rarely seen photographs. The exhibition, which coincided with the Nigerian celebration of 100 years as a united country, was curated by professor and photographer Flora S. Kaplan, who corresponded with <b>Alonge</b> and visited Benin in 1982. Among the first visitors to the exhibit were members of Benin's royal court and Alonge's family. Attendees included his colleagues and friends, his children, and Prince Ademola Iyi-Eweka, grandson of the oba who served from 1914 to 1933. Also present were many subjects of Alonge's photographs, now in their late 70s and 80s. The exhibition is scheduled to continue until January 2016.

2500|$|<b>Alonge</b> {{was born}} in Benin City in 1911. He learned English at the Benin Baptist Elementary School and {{at the age of}} 14 moved to Lagos to live with uncle to learn a profession. There, he {{developed}} an interest in photography and took on an apprenticeship. In 1930, <b>Alonge</b> returned to Benin and began practicing photography from his home on Ugbague Street. He frequently traveled outside Benin City, taking school portraits and photographing gatherings at social clubs, sporting events, and government ceremonies. When the son of the current oba, the Edo word for [...] "ruler", took over in 1933, <b>Alonge</b> became his court photographer, documenting the final and elaborate traditional burial ceremony for Oba Akenzua's mother in 1935.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Alonge's</b> {{talent was}} {{recognized}} early {{on by the}} British, and {{he was asked to}} take photographs for the colonial administrators in the 1930s and 1940s. In the late 1930s, he became {{a founding member of the}} Benin Social Circle, a group of businessmen, leaders, and the educated elite.

5000|$|Unlike <b>Alonge's</b> {{previous}} albums {{that focused}} primarily on satirizing musical tropes, Space Zombies directly parodies the bands The Devil Wears Prada, A Day to Remember, Architects, and For Today.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, the British {{seized control of}} Benin City, {{bringing}} with them their photographic traditions.

As the first indigenous royal court photographer, <b>Alonge</b> changed this narrative. His work helped to usher {{in an era of}} Nigerians representing themselves and acting as keepers of their own history. This shift allowed the subjects to present themselves {{in a way that they}} felt was dignified. One such photograph was that of a proud Oba Akenzua II displaying the royal regalia of his grandfather, Ovonramwen, that was returned by the British to Benin in 1938.|$|E
