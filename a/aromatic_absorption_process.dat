To determine the isotherms and kinetics adsorption <b>Process,</b> <b>absorption</b> of methylene blue cationic dye as an indexed color were investigated by activated thermal power plant fly ash from of Zarand. Methods: In this experimental study, raw fly ash during 5 h, acid concentration 1. 8 M, acid to fly ash ratio 7 and temperature 29 ± 2 ˚C was activated by sulfuric acid. After determining the optimal values of parameters in the <b>absorption</b> <b>process</b> (pH, contact time, concentration of adsorbent) isotherms Freundlich and Langmuir Type 1, 2, 3, 4 and Kinetics of first and second types 1, 2, 3 and 4 and the separation factor was determined.
