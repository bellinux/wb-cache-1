40|$|Abstract — We {{study the}} Gaussian multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) wiretap channel, which {{consists}} of a transmitter, a legitimate user, and an eavesdropper. In this channel, the transmitter sends <b>a</b> common <b>message</b> <b>to</b> both the legitimate user and the eavesdropper. Moreover, the legitimate user receives <b>a</b> private <b>message,</b> which is desired to be kept hidden {{as much as possible}} from the eavesdropper. We obtain the entire capacityequivocation region of the Gaussian MIMO wiretap channel. This region contains all achievable common message, private message, and private message’s equivocation rates. This capacityequivocation region is equal to the capacity region of a Gaussian MIMO broadcast channel where the transmitter sends <b>a</b> common <b>message</b> <b>to</b> both the legitimate user and the eavesdropper, <b>a</b> public <b>message</b> <b>to</b> the legitimate user on which there is no secrecy constraint, and <b>a</b> confidential <b>message</b> <b>to</b> the legitimate user which needs to kept perfectly secret from the eavesdropper.
