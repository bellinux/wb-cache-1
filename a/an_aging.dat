To replace these Amtrak ordered 150 EMD SDP40F locomotives, which began entering service in 1973. These were supplemented by 25 GE P30CHs which entered service in 1975. The SDP40F was a troubled design; problems with weight distribution led {{to a series of}} derailments in the mid-1970s. Meanwhile, the poor truck design of the P30CH (and the electric GE E60CP) curtailed further orders of that unit when Amtrak found itself needing more short- and medium-distance power in the spring of 1975.|$|E

5|$|Amtrak {{took over}} {{operation}} of most intercity rail passenger {{service in the}} United States on May 1, 1971; up until then such services were run by various private railroads. The private railroads chose to retain their most modern passenger locomotives to operate the various commuter services which, by law, did not pass to Amtrak. To operate these intercity services the company had to buy or lease from the private railroads whatever locomotives remained. This left Amtrak with <b>an</b> <b>aging</b> and mechanically-incompatible fleet of diesel locomotives. The mainstays of Amtrak's road diesel fleet were veteran EMD E8s and EMD E9s, which were all 10–20 years old and due for replacement.|$|E

A particular creek near Wausau met the requirements for the legend, and Majak murdered Em near it in a ritual to extend his life. However, Em's recent pregnancy provided additional life force and caused an imbalance that resulted in Revival Day. The imbalance is still affecting the river, and will grow to threaten all life on Earth. To restore balance, Em must give birth before she reunites with her soul and permanently dies. As she delivers her daughter, the remaining revivers merge with their souls as well.|$|E
