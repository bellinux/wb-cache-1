5|$|Arthur (Or the Decline <b>and</b> <b>Fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British Empire) is {{the seventh}} studio album by English rock band the Kinks, {{released}} in October 1969. Kinks frontman Ray Davies constructed the concept album as the soundtrack to a Granada Television play and developed the storyline with novelist Julian Mitchell; however, the television programme was cancelled and never produced. The rough plot revolved around Arthur Morgan, a carpet-layer, who {{was based on}} Ray and guitarist Dave Davies' brother-in-law Arthur Anning. A mono version was released in the UK, {{but not in the}} US. It is now available on the 2011 deluxe-edition re-issue.|$|E
5|$|In 1827, he {{published}} two volumes of Personal Sketches of His Own Times. In 1830, by an address from both Houses of Parliament, he {{was removed from}} the Bench, in consequence of well-proven misappropriation of public moneys. The third volume of Personal Sketches appeared in 1833 as did the delayed volume of his Historic Memoirs. This book was subsequently reproduced in a cheaper form as The Rise <b>and</b> <b>Fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Irish Nation. His works are interesting, racy, and valuable – although his statements of fact cannot always be depended on – containing much of personal incident, related in a fascinating style. He died at Versailles on 8 April 1834.|$|E
5|$|Roman domes {{were used}} in baths, villas, palaces, and tombs. Oculi were common features. They were customarily {{hemispherical}} in shape and partially or totally concealed on the exterior. In order to buttress the horizontal thrusts of a large hemispherical masonry dome, the supporting walls were built up beyond the base to at least the haunches of the dome and the dome was then also sometimes covered with a conical or polygonal roof. A variety of other shapes, including shallow saucer domes, segmental domes, and ribbed domes were also sometimes used. The audience halls of many imperial palaces were domed. Domes were also very common over polygonal garden pavilions. Construction and development of domes declined in the west with the decline <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> western portion of the empire.|$|E

5|$|Senator Henry Wilson, {{founder of}} the unit, was well known during the war for his antislavery {{political}} stance. After the war, {{he became one of}} the leading Radical Republicans in Congress, pressing for civil rights for former slaves and harsh treatment of former Confederates. In 1872, the same year he was elected Vice-President under Ulysses Grant, Wilson published the first volume of his History of the Rise <b>and</b> <b>Fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Slave Power, a severe criticism of slave owners and their primary role, according to Wilson, in bringing about the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The barbarisation theory, {{ultimately}} {{derived from}} Edward Gibbon's 18th-century magnum opus, The Decline <b>and</b> <b>Fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman Empire, contains two propositions. (1) That the late army recruited much {{greater numbers of}} barbarian-born troops than {{the army of the}} Principate; and (2) that the greater number of barbarian recruits resulted in a major decline of the army's effectiveness and was a leading factor in the collapse of the Western Roman empire. As discussed above, proposition (1) is probably correct, although it should be borne in mind that probably about three-quarters of the late army's recruits remained Roman-born. This section considers proposition (2).|$|E
5|$|The {{results were}} not immediate. In 1862, cattle sold at La Souterraine weighed about 600kg. The decline of Anglomania {{in favour of}} {{economic}} pragmatism, and the criticism <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aristocracy aided the development of Limousin cattle. The Limousin breed became renowned {{for the quality of}} its meat and the exceptional performance of its carcase, and was voted best European breed in 1857, 1858 and 1859 during the food animal competitions held in Poissy. The crowning moment was the honour received by the bull Achilles Caillaud to open the competition in Paris for all breeds in 1886 (the year the Limousin Herd Book was created), and the grand champion prize of all breeds won three years later by Charles Léobardy for his team.|$|E

5|$|The {{suicide of}} Nero on 9 June 68 brought the Julio-Claudian dynasty to an end, {{leading to the}} chaotic Year of the Four Emperors, which saw the {{successive}} rise <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emperors Galba, Otho and Vitellius, until the accession of Vespasian on 21 December 69.

5|$|The {{walls were}} again {{restored}} under Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282–1328) and again under his successor Andronikos III Palaiologos (r. 1328–1341), when, on 12 February 1332, a major storm caused breaches {{in the wall}} and forced the seaward gates open. In 1351, when the empire was {{at war with the}} Genoese, John VI Kantakouzenos again repaired the walls, and even opened a moat in front of the wall facing the Golden Horn. Other repairs are recorded for 1434, again against the Genoese, and again in the years leading up to the final siege <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city to the Ottomans, partly with funds provided by the Despot of Serbia, George Brankovic.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century Reformation and Counter-Reformation, Western historians saw the Crusades {{through the}} lens of their own {{religious}} beliefs. Protestants saw them as a manifestation of the evils of the papacy, and Catholics viewed them as forces for good. 18th century Enlightenment historians tended to view the Middle Ages in general, and the Crusades in particular, as the efforts of barbarian cultures driven by fanaticism. These scholars expressed moral outrage at the conduct of the Crusaders and criticised the Crusades' misdirectionthat of the Fourth in particular, which attacked a Christian power (the Byzantine Empire) instead of Islam. The Fourth Crusade had resulted in the sacking of Constantinople, effectively ending any chance of reconciling the East–West Schism and leading to the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Ottomans. In The History of the Decline <b>and</b> <b>Fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman Empire, 18th-century English historian Edward Gibbon wrote that the Crusaders' efforts could have been more profitably directed towards improving their own countries.|$|E
