5000|$|Daun ubi tumbuk (Indonesian for [...] "pounded cassava leaves") is a {{vegetable}} dish {{commonly found in}} Indonesia, made from pounded cassava leaves. In Indonesian, daun means leaf, ubi refers to cassava, and tumbuk means pounded. The cassava leaves are traditionally pounded with a wooden mortar and pestle, although finely chopping or puréeing them using <b>a</b> <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> is an alternative.|$|E
50|$|The spice {{mixture is}} {{commonly}} made by slicing, chopping, grinding, beating, bruising, or sometimes burning the spices, using traditional cooking {{tools such as}} stone mortar and pestle, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> modern <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> <b>food</b> processor. The bumbu mixture was usually stir fried in hot cooking oil first to release its aroma, prior to adding the main ingredient (meats, poultry, or fish).|$|R
5000|$|It is {{prepared}} {{at least a}} day or more in advance by braising or simmering a piece of veal from the back leg called Eye Round, which is then cut into thin, individual servings. For the sauce, originally fresh white tuna (in most restaurants canned tuna is used today to reduce cost and preparation time) is simmered until fully cooked in white wine, cider vinegar, white onion and garlic, and then puréed with a mix of olive and vegetable oil and egg yolks in <b>an</b> electric <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> <b>food</b> processor to form a thick mayonnaise. For the mayonnaise a variety of seasonings can be used, including anchovies, cayenne pepper and lemon juice. The thick, smooth purée is then somewhat thinned with a little water and cooking liquid from the veal and a few capers are stirred in. Some of the sauce is spread out on a serving platter and the cold slices of veal are arranged {{in a single layer on}} top. The rest of the sauce is then poured over the veal so that it is, generally, completely covered. The dish is allowed to refrigerate for a period up to 5 days to fully develop the flavor.|$|R
5000|$|This {{piece of}} kitchen equipment, of long-proven efficiency, bridges {{the gap between}} a sieve (or tamis, china cap, or chinoise) and the {{electric}} <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> <b>food</b> processor. Its function {{is similar to that}} of a potato ricer or [...] "hob" [...] type of spätzle maker.|$|R
50|$|Chutneys may {{be ground}} with {{a mortar and pestle}} or an ammikkal (Tamil). Spices are added and ground, usually in a {{particular}} order; the wet paste thus made is sautéed in vegetable oil, usually gingelly (sesame) or peanut oil. Electric <b>blenders</b> <b>or</b> <b>food</b> processors can be used as labor-saving alternatives to stone grinding.|$|R
5000|$|... ====Food preparation==== In {{kitchen or}} {{laboratory}} settings, solids may be chopped into smaller parts sometimes {{in combination with}} a liquid, for example in <b>food</b> preparation <b>or</b> laboratory use.

5000|$|Full-service restaurants, soda fountains, and diners usually {{prepare and}} mix the shake [...] "by hand" [...] from scoops {{of ice cream}} and milk in <b>a</b> <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> drink mixer using a {{stainless}} steel cup. Many fast food outlets do not make shakes by hand with ice cream. Instead, they make shakes in automatic milkshake machines which freeze and serve a premade milkshake mixture consisting of milk, a sweetened flavoring agent, and a thickening agent. However, some fast food outlets still follow the traditional method, and some serve milkshakes which are prepared by blending soft-serve ice cream (or ice milk) with flavoring or syrups. Milkshakes can also be made at home with <b>a</b> <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> automatic drink mixer.|$|R

5000|$|Spices have {{traditionally}} been made on grinding stones, however, since villages have seen rapid growth and industrialization in recent decades, today people may use <b>a</b> <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> grinder. People from north Gujarat use dry red chili powder, whereas people from south Gujarat prefer using green chili and coriander in their cooking. There is no standard recipe for Gujarati dishes, however the use of tomatoes and lemons is a consistent theme throughout Gujarat. [...] Traditionally Gujaratis eat mukhwas {{at the end of}} a meal to enhance digestion, and desserts such as aam shrikhand made using mango salad and hung curd are very popular. In many parts of Gujarat, drinking chaas (chilled buttermilk) or soda after lunch or dinner is also quite common.|$|R
5000|$|Manteiga de garrafa is a {{dairy product}} {{made from the}} cream of cows' milk. The cream is {{processed}} by physical agitation, as in <b>a</b> <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> beating by hand, followed by cooking at a temperature of 100 C to 130 C. Salt may also be added. Some recipes for making manteiga de garrafa include a step prior to cooking in which the congealed cream is washed in cold water. The cooking process separates the cream into two components, the manteiga (butter) and the [...] "borra" [...] (a watery precipitate). The manteiga is separated from the borra by filtration, and then placed in bottles. The finished product is almost pure fat, with a low water activity. Accordingly, it is inhospitable to microbial growth and can be kept at room temperature.|$|R
50|$|In both sweetcrust and shortcrust pastry, {{care must}} be taken to ensure that fat and flour are blended {{thoroughly}} before liquid is added. This ensures that the flour granules are adequately coated with fat and are less likely to develop gluten and may be achieved {{with the use of a}} food processor, a specialized kitchen utensil called <b>a</b> pastry <b>blender,</b> <b>or</b> through various alternatives, like a pair of table knives held in one hand.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a simple, practical method for routine clinical determination of long- and medium-chain stool lipids. Stool lipids were extracted {{into a hot}} mixture of benzene/etha-nol/water (12 / 59 / 29, by vol), saponified in 30 mm without formation of ethyl esters, and titrated in a clear, one-phase medium to a sharp color change. CVs for the titration were 2. 1, and 1 % for 0. 05, 0. 25. and 0. 5 mmol of fatty acids, respectively. Interference of stool short-chain acids other than fatty acids was not statistically significant. The pre-cision of sampling of stool homogenate was improved by analysis of two aliquots, one from the top and one {{from the bottom of}} the suspension. This method of sampling is a practical alternative to the unpleasant homogenization with <b>a</b> <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> to the addition of large quantities of bile salts. The accuracy of the method may be increased, in specia...|$|R
50|$|The fire used {{in cooking}} {{can be either}} strong fire or small fire for slow cooking. Cooking nasi goreng usually employs strong fire, while {{authentic}} rendang for example requires small fire for slow cooking of beef, spices, and coconut milk until the meat is caramelised and all the coconut milk's liquid has evaporated. Traditional Indonesian dapur (kitchen) usually employs firewood-fuelled kitchen stove, while the contemporary household today uses liquefied petroleum gas-fuelled stove or an electric stove. The ingredients could be cut in pieces, sliced thinly, or ground into a paste. Cooking utensils are wajan (wok), penggorengan (frying pan), panci (cauldron), knives, several types of spoon and fork, parutan (shredder), cobek and ulekan (stone mortar and pestle). Traditionally Indonesians use a stone mortar and a pestle to grind the spices and ingredients into coarse or fine pastes. Today most households use <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> <b>food</b> processor for the task. Traditional Indonesian cookingwares are usually made from stone, earthenware pottery, wood, and woven bamboo or a rattan container or filter, while contemporary cookingwares, plates and containers use metals - iron, tin, stainless steel, aluminium, ceramics, plastics, and also glass.|$|R
5000|$|Darryl Parks (Finesse Mitchell) (season 1-2; season 3, guest star) is hopelessly stupid {{father of}} Chyna and Cameron. He loves his {{daughter}} dearly, {{but can be}} very overprotective at times, going to extreme and often ridiculous measures to ensure her safety (all the while insulting and neglecting Cameron). He is also known to be criminally cheap. Though known as a [...] "highly decorated" [...] police officer, he is rarely seen taking his job very seriously and is proud of having [...] "San Francisco's cleanest cop car" [...] Episodes have shown that Darryl would make a better criminal than policeman, such as stealing gifts for Chyna out of the evidence locker, and taking Cameron on unauthorized ride-alongs. Although he loves his children, he is often seen mistreating them in a comical way (such as when he has them defrost lamb chops under their arms, uses Cameron's mouth as <b>a</b> <b>blender,</b> <b>or</b> when he speaks of playing fetch with Cameron as a child). At one point he had been hired by school of Chyna and Cameron to teach driver education classes with go-karts as practice.|$|R
5000|$|Adrià is {{well known}} for {{creating}} [...] "culinary foam." [...] Adrià explored foams created without the addition of cream or egg white; foams are made of a flavoured liquid and an additive (such as lecithin), then aerated through a variety of methods, including whipping with <b>an</b> immersion <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> extrusion from <b>a</b> siphon bottle equipped with N2O cartridges. Further culinary processes (such as freeze-drying or freezing with liquid nitrogen) may be applied to foams as well. Using a single flavoured liquid allows the flavour of the final product to be less diluted and thus more intense.|$|R
50|$|More recently, foams {{have become}} a part of {{molecular}} gastronomy technique. In these cases, natural flavors (such as fruit juices, infusions of aromatic herbs, etc.) are mixed with a neutrally-flavored gelling or stabilizing agent such as agar or lecithin, and either whipped with <b>a</b> hand-held immersion <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> extruded through <b>a</b> whipped cream canister equipped with nitrous oxide cartridges. Some famous food-foams are foamed espresso, foamed mushroom, foamed beet and foamed coconut. An espuma or thermo whip is commonly used to make these foams through the making of a stock, creating a gel and extruding through the nitrous oxide canister.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to being shaken and served [...] "up" [...] like other cocktails, margaritas can also be served as a blended ice slush similar to other tropical-inspired mixed drinks like the hurricane or piña colada. This variant {{is known as a}} frozen margarita. The ingredients can be poured over crushed ice in <b>a</b> kitchen <b>blender,</b> <b>or</b> for larger establishments that serve many of these, a large quantity of a [...] "house recipe" [...] of frozen margarita can be kept in a machine designed specifically for the purpose (but also commonly used to serve non-alcoholic slush drinks); a cylinder leading to a pour spout is kept below freezing temperature, but an impeller within the cylinder constantly churns the mix so it can't freeze solid, and so it dispenses as a thick half-frozen slush. The first frozen margarita machine was invented on May 11, 1971, by Dallas restaurateur Mariano Martinez. The machine was originally a soft-serve ice cream machine and now sits in the Smithsonian National Museum of History.|$|R
5000|$|Hydraulic-fracturing {{equipment}} used {{in oil and}} natural gas fields usually consists of <b>a</b> slurry <b>blender,</b> one <b>or</b> more high-pressure, high-volume fracturing pumps (typically powerful triplex or quintuplex pumps) and a monitoring unit. Associated equipment includes fracturing tanks, one or more units for storage and handling of proppant, high-pressure treating iron, a chemical additive unit (used to accurately monitor chemical addition), low-pressure flexible hoses, and many gauges and meters for flow rate, fluid density, and treating pressure. Chemical additives are typically 0.5% percent of the total fluid volume. Fracturing equipment operates over a range of pressures and injection rates, and can reach up to [...] and [...] (100 barrels per minute).|$|R
40|$|Several dry {{processing}} {{techniques are}} used to coat cohesive cornstarch powder with different size silica particles. For nanosized silica guest particles, FESEM images show that both the magnetic assisted impaction coater (MAIC) and the hybridizer (HB) produce particles that are significantly more uniformly coated than using either <b>a</b> V-shape <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> simple hand mixing. Image analysis confirms that MAIC and HB provide higher surface coverage {{for the amount of}} guest material (flow aid) used. The improvement in flowablity of coated cornstarch is determined from angle of repose measurements using a Hosokawa powder tester. These measurements show that nanosized silica provides the best flowability enhancement, whereas mono-dispersed 500 -nm silica does not improve the flow properties of cornstarch at all. This observation agrees with a simple theoretical derivation based on the original Rumpf model, which shows that the flowability improvement is inversely proportional to the guest particle size for a given host particle size or size of surface asperities. Experimental results also indicate that surface-treated hydrophobic silica is more effective in improving the flowability of cornstarch particles than untreated hydrophilic silica. An increase in processing time using MAIC and the V-blender also improves the flowability of the cornstarch since the guest particles are more deagglomerated and better dispersed, the longer the processing time...|$|R
