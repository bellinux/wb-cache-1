40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the applicability of an auditing method {{for the prevention of}} statistical database compromise through data inference. In 1982 Chin and Oszoyoglu proposed <b>Audit</b> <b>Expert</b> for the prevention of such a compromise using SUM queries. As originally proposed, <b>Audit</b> <b>Expert</b> was meant to be used dynamically and it was considered suitable only for small databases. In the static mode <b>Audit</b> <b>Expert</b> is much more efficient both in the storage and time required and so can be used for large databases as well as small ones. Moreover, in static mode it is possible to achieve maximum usability of the database. However, sometimes this will prevent the system from answering queries which are particularly important. In this paper {{we consider the}} inclusion of a limited number of user-posed queries {{and its impact on the}} usability. Then we say that the <b>Audit</b> <b>Expert</b> is used in a hybrid mode. We prove that maximising usability in a general hybrid <b>Audit</b> <b>Expert</b> is NP-complete and we isolate ce [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A {{statistical}} database is {{a database}} {{in which only}} queries of statistical type are allowed, such as SUM, COUNT, MAX, MIN, MEAN. The security problem for a statistical database is to find suitable control mechanisms so that while statistical information is provided, no sequence of queries is sufficient to infer the values of protected fields of individual records. If such an inference is possible we say that the database has been compromised. Various types of compromise have been defined, including positive, negative and relative compromise, and many types of control mechanisms have been proposed for the protection against database compromise. One of the possible methods is the <b>Audit</b> <b>Expert</b> proposed by Chin and Oszoyoglu {{for the prevention of}} database compromise using SUM queries. At the heart of the <b>Audit</b> <b>Expert</b> is the query basis matrix which is used to determine whether a new query is `harmless' and so should be answered or whether it would lead to a compromise and so should be rejec [...] ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{feasibility}} of auditing interval-based inference. Sensitive information about individuals {{is said to be}} compromised if an accurate enough interval, called inference interval, is obtained into which the value of the sensitive information must fall. Compared with auditing exact inference that is traditionally studied, auditing interval-based inference is more complicated. Existing auditing methods such as <b>audit</b> <b>expert</b> do not apply to this case. Our result shows that it is intractable to audit interval-based inference for bounded integer values; while for bounded real values, the auditing problem is polynomial yet involves complicated computation of mathematical programming. To further examine the practicability of auditing interval-based inference, we classify various auditing methods into three categories: exact auditing, optimistic auditing, and pessimistic auditing. We analyze the trade-offs that can be achieved by these methods among various auditing objectives: inference security, database usability, and auditing complexity...|$|E
40|$|We discuss {{applications}} of combinatorial arguments to database security: maximizing the "usability" of a statistical database {{under the control}} of the mechanism <b>Audit</b> <b>Expert</b> of Chin and Ozsoyoglu. As modelled by Mirka Miller et al., the goal is to maximize the number of SUM queries from a database of real numbers without compromising it. Via linear algebra, direct connections emerge between such database query models and problems that concern maximimizing, over all choices of n nonzero elements a 1,..., a n in R m, the number of the 2 n subset sums P i#I a i, over all index sets I, belonging to some specified target set T. Well-known problems of this kind that arise, including the Littlewood-O#ord and Erdos-Moser problems in number theory, have been successfully attacked using results and methods for partially ordered sets. We survey these connections and their extensions to higher dimensions. Fascinating new challenges have emerged with two new models of compromise tha [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} the results of an investigation into the methods of <b>auditing</b> <b>Expert</b> Systems. Such systems have already proved to be, and are increasingly becoming, a very powerful tool in many areas such as medicine, geology, finance and banking. They embody unique risks which are not treated by conventional audit methods of operating or developing software. The lack of awareness and information about Expert Systems in general and their auditability in particular are somewhat surprising. The author, in tackling this new area, has developed and proposed two models of <b>auditing</b> <b>Expert</b> Systems: a) the Audit of an Operating Expert System (AOES), b) the <b>Audit</b> of an <b>Expert</b> System under development (AESD). The first model incorporates the" control band" which aims at eliminating the exceptional risks and to allow the internal auditor to treat it as conventional software. The second proposed model is based on "NESDEM'; a normative evaluation model for Expert Systems. The test of the proposed AOES model was conducted in two different organisations: ARJO-WIGGINS APPLETON which developed and still uses an Expert System for its paper mill and the CITY UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENT OF OPTOMETRY AND VISUAL SCIENCE which developed an Expert System for eye tests. Unfortunately the author was unable to test his proposed AESD model under a "live" development process due to lack of cooperation from organisations which the author contacted. Consequently he tested this model by mailing questionnaires to internal/external auditors within the U. K. Given the research performed in this study and subject to the limitations detailed, the proposed models appear reliable, flexible, practical and suitable to the internal auditor in assessing the effectiveness of the internal controls within Expert Systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{statistical}} database (SDB) is {{a database}} {{that is used}} to return statistical information derived from the records to user queries for statistical data analysis. Sometimes, by correlating enough statistics, confidential data (stored in a SDB) about an individual can be inferred. Examples of confidential information stored in a SDB might be salaries or data concerning the medical history of individuals. An important problem is to provide security to SDB against the disclosure of confidential information. A statistical database is said to be secure if no protected data can be inferred from the available queries. One of the security-control methods suggested in the literature consists of query restriction: the security problem is to limit the use of the SDB, introducing a control mechanism, such that no protected data can be obtained from the available queries. Chin and Ozsoyoglu [7] introduced a control mechanism, called <b>Audit</b> <b>Expert,</b> where only SUM queries, that is only certain sums of individual records, are available for the users. This SUM query model leads to several challenging optimization problems. Assume there are n numeric records {z 1, [...] ., zn} stored in a database.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three separate but related essays examining auditor changes, auditor industry specialization and audit fee premiums. ^ The first essay investigates whether audit committee characteristics affect the types of auditor changes from an industry specialist auditor to a non-industry specialist auditor or the reverse. I examine whether selection of an external auditor is affected by audit committee characteristics such as: 1) number of meetings, 2) number of members on the audit committee, 3) proportion of <b>auditing</b> <b>experts</b> and, 4) proportion of financial experts. The findings show that {{a greater proportion of}} <b>auditing</b> <b>experts</b> on the <b>audit</b> committee positively influences the switch from a non-industry specialist to an industry specialist auditor, while more sizable audit committees lower the probability of firm switching from a specialist to a non-specialist non-big four global audit firm. ^ The second essay examines the association between shareholders 2 ̆ 7 ratification voting on an external auditor and the switch between specialists. For a sample of publicly listed U. S. firms for years 2005 - 2011, I explore whether the effects of lateral (from one specialist to another or from one non-specialist to another), downward (industry specialist to a non-industry specialist) and upward (non-industry specialist to an industry specialist) switches affect shareholder ratification of the selected audit firm. The findings show that downward switches are viewed more negatively than upward switches. Further, there is limited evidence of differences in voting outcomes between downward and lateral switches. ^ The third essay explores whether audit fee premiums for firms cross-listed on the US stock exchanges are higher for firms that hire specialists. This essay uses a sample of firms cross-listed on the US stock exchanges, and explores whether culture moderates the relationship between choice of a specialist and audit fee premiums. The findings show that specialization premiums vary with the secrecy dimension. ^ Directions for future research are suggested and potential implications for regulators and policy makers are discussed. ...|$|R
