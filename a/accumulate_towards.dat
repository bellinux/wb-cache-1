50|$|If one {{material}} is more soluble in the solvent than the other, it will deposit first {{on top of}} the substrate, causing a concentration gradient through the film. This has been demonstrated for poly-3-hexyl thiophene (P3HT), phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) devices where the PCBM tends to <b>accumulate</b> <b>towards</b> the device's bottom upon spin coating from ODCB solutions. This effect is seen because the more soluble component tends to migrate towards the “solvent rich” phase during the coating procedure, accumulating the more soluble component towards the film's bottom, where the solvent remains longer. The thickness of the generated film affects the phases segregation because the dynamics of crystallization and precipitation are different for more concentrated solutions or faster evaporation rates (needed to build thicker devices). Crystalline P3HT enrichment closer to the hole-collecting electrode can only be achieved for relatively thin (100 nm) P3HT/PCBM layers.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAtmospheric {{nitrogen}} (N) deposition increasingly impacts remote ecosystems. At high altitudes, snow {{is a key}} {{carrier of}} water and nutrients from the atmosphere to the soil. Medium-sized subalpine grassland terraces are characteristic of agricultural landscapes in the French Alps and influence spatial and temporal snow pack variables. At the Lautaret Pass, we investigated snow and soil characteristics along mesotopographic gradients across the terraces before and during snowmelt. Total N concentrations in the snowpack did not vary spatially and were dominated by organic N forms either brought by dry deposition trapped by the snow, or due to snow-microbial immobilization and turnover. As expected, snowpack depth, total N deposited with snow and snowmelt followed the terrace toposequence; more snow-N <b>accumulated</b> <b>towards</b> the bank over longer periods. However, direct effects of snow-N on soil-N cycling seem unlikely since the amount of nitrogen released into the soil from the snowpack was very small relative to soil-N pools and N mineralization rates. Nevertheless, some snow-N reached the soil at thaw where it underwent biotic and abiotic processes. In situ soil-N mineralization rates did not vary along the terrace toposequence but soil-N cycling was indirectly affected by the snowpack. Indeed, N mineralization responded to the snowmelt dynamic via induced temporal changes in soil characteristics (i. e. moisture and T°) which cascaded down to affect N-related microbial activities and soil pH. Soil-NH 4 and DON <b>accumulated</b> <b>towards</b> the bank during snowmelt while soil-NO 3 followed a pulse-release pattern. At {{the end of the}} snowmelt season, organic substrate limitation might be accountable for the decrease in N mineralization in general, and in NH 4 + production in particular. Possibly, during snowmelt, other biotic or abiotic processes (nitrification, denitrification, plant uptake, leaching) were involved in the transformation and transfer of snow and soil-N pools. Finally, subalpine soils at the Lautaret Pass during snowmelt experienced strong biotic and abiotic changes and switched between a source and a sink of N...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} two decades a {{universal}} agreement has been established on the fact that software inspections play a fundamental role in improving software quality. The number of software organizations that have incorporated formal reviews in their development process is constantly increasing and the belief that efficient inspections can not only detect defects but also reduce cycle time and lower costs is spreading. However, despite the importance of the inspections in a software development project, scheduling of inspections has not been given the necessary attention so far. As a result, inspections tend to <b>accumulate</b> <b>towards</b> internal project deadlines, possibly leading to excess overtime costs, quality degradation and difficulties in meeting milestones.

40|$|Brownian {{motion of}} {{microscopic}} particles {{is driven by}} collisions with surrounding fluid molecules. The resulting noise is not white, but coloured, due, e. g., {{to the presence of}} hydrodynamic memory. The noise characteristic time-scale is typically of the same order of magnitude as the inertial time-scale over which the particle's kinetic energy is lost due to friction. We demonstrate theoretically that, {{in the presence of a}} temperature gradient, the interplay between these two characteristic time-scales can have measurable consequences on the particle's long-time behaviour. Using homogenization theory, we analyse the infinitesimal generator of the stochastic differential equation describing the system in the limit where the two time-scales are taken to zero keeping their ratio constant and derive the thermophoretic transport coefficient, which, we find, can vary in both magnitude and sign, as observed in experiments. Studying the long-term stationary particle distribution, we show that particles <b>accumulate</b> <b>towards</b> the colder (positive thermophoresis) or the hotter (negative thermophoresis) regions depending on their physical parameters. © Copyright EPLA, 2012...|$|E
30|$|Hydrocarbon {{tends to}} migrate and <b>accumulate</b> <b>towards</b> the {{structural}} high. The structural ridge, as a height position, is undoubtedly the predominant migration pathway {{for oil and}} gas adjusting. However, it is only a general trend for hydrocarbon migration. Whether the structural ridge can be the predominant migration pathway is dependent not only on lateral variation of sand bodies (configuration of sand bodies and structural ridge), but also on cooperation between sand bodies and faults. According to fault characteristics (Fig.  5) and sand body distribution features (Fig.  6), the Jurassic faults and the sand bodies of the J 1 s are steadily distributed along the structural ridge, providing a favorable pathway for hydrocarbon adjustment. In addition, the present-day structural form and the oil and gas pools distribution indicate that hydrocarbon did migrate laterally and vertically along the structural ridge, through the thick sand bodies J 1 s 2 and the Jurassic faults. Although the structural ridges are the present day ones, they can reflect the general oil migration trend, for oil has been still at the adjustment period since the Himalayan movement.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} DC and AC {{magnetic}} fields on the macrostructure, morphology {{and distribution of}} the iron-containing intermetallics in the commercially pure Al was investigated. It is found that, at a cooling rate of 3 ℃/min, the grain is very coarse when the alloy solidifies both with and without magnetic fields. Comparing with the sample solidifies without magnetic field, the solidification structure has almost no change when it solidifies under DC magnetic field, while AC magnetic field changes the solidification structure obviously and makes grains show radial columnar crystals. The intermetallics is dominated by long needle-like phase when the sample solidifies under the condition of no magnetic field. Under AC magnetic field, the intermetallics is refined and <b>accumulated</b> <b>towards</b> the center of sample, {{and the amount of}} bone-like α-AlFeSi phase is increased remarkably.
