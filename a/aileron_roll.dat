25|$|On July 15, 1964, another Boeing 720 (registered D-ABOP) crashed {{during a}} {{training}} flight, {{with the three}} people, including Werner Baake, on board losing their lives (in what was only the second crash for this aircraft type). The accident occurred near Ansbach after the pilots had {{lost control of the}} aircraft when executing an <b>aileron</b> <b>roll.</b>|$|E
500|$|Congressmen Sherman P. Lloyd (R-Utah) and Henry S. Reuss (D-Wis) both {{decried the}} actions of the Marine jet fighter, which media at the time {{indicated}} had been [...] "stunting" [...] prior to the collision. In actuality, the 360째 <b>aileron</b> <b>roll</b> maneuver the fighter pilot executed was to observe any air traffic above or below the aircraft. Lloyd said that military aircraft should be required to establish contact with air traffic controllers when entering high-traffic air corridors and around airports, while Reuss advocated the complete ban of military aircraft from any high-traffic civilian air corridors. Senator Frank Moss (D-Utah) sponsored a bill in December that would require the installation of anti-collision gear on all aircraft by 1975.|$|E
500|$|Soon after {{reaching}} , the fighter's DME (radio) showed MCAS El Toro was [...] away. The pilot of '458' then performed an <b>aileron</b> <b>roll,</b> a flight maneuver that rolled the aircraft 360째 {{in order to}} allow the pilot to observe any air traffic above or below the aircraft. Lt. Schiess, the Radar Intercept Officer, was operating the fighter's radar, which was unable to detect any aircraft due to its deteriorated condition. Because of the stowed position of the scope, he had been leaning forward and looking downward at the instrument. Between three and ten seconds prior to the collision, he glanced up and observed the DC-9 in his peripheral vision and shouted a warning to the pilot. The pilot attempted an evasive roll but was unable to clear the oncoming airliner.|$|E

40|$|Results are {{presented}} of light tests made {{to determine the}} effect of flap deflection on the lateral control characteristics of a modified brewster f 2 a- 2 airplane equipped with partial-span narrow-chord ailerons on the trailing edge of a full-span NACA slotted flap. The investigation included determination of the rolling and yawing characteristics of the airplane in abrupt <b>aileron</b> <b>rolls</b> with the slotted flap at various settings ranging from 0 degree to about 40 degrees. The results showed that the effectiveness of the ailerons was greatly reduced at flap deflections greater than about 20 degrees. For flap deflections up to about 20 degrees, the aileron effectiveness was about the same as with flaps retracted, but the adverse yawing velocity developed in the abrupt <b>aileron</b> <b>rolls</b> was somewhat increased...|$|R

2500|$|In Corridor Mode, the player's vehicle can be maneuvered {{around the}} screen to dodge {{obstacles}} and shoot incoming enemies with laser cannons, and can also perform a somersault to get behind enemies or dodge projectiles. The Arwing is also capable of deflecting enemy fire while performing a spinning maneuver called a [...] "barrel roll" [...] (actually an <b>aileron</b> <b>roll</b> in real life aviation terms). The Arwing and Landmaster can charge up their laser cannons to unleash a powerful lock-on laser. [...] The Arwing can perform one new maneuver in All-Range Mode: an Immelmann up-and-over to change direction. In-game, {{this is called a}} U-turn.|$|E
50|$|The <b>aileron</b> <b>roll</b> is {{commonly}} used in air shows and aerial combat training. The use of the pure <b>aileron</b> <b>roll</b> in air combat is contentious, but many common maneuvers bear heavy dependence on the <b>aileron</b> <b>roll.</b> Examples of this are the Immelmann turn, barrel roll, and Split S.|$|E

50|$|The <b>aileron</b> <b>roll</b> is an {{aerobatic}} maneuver {{in which}} an aircraft does a full 360째 revolution about its longitudinal axis. When executed properly, there is no appreciable change in altitude and the aircraft exits the maneuver on the same heading as it entered. This is commonly {{one of the first}} maneuvers taught in basic aerobatics courses. The <b>aileron</b> <b>roll</b> is commonly confused with a barrel roll.|$|E

50|$|A152 Aerobat: Two-seat aerobatic-capable aircraft, 315 built. Certified for +6/-3 Gs and had {{standard}} four-point harnesses, skylights and jettisonable doors, {{along with}} a checkerboard paint scheme and removable seat cushions to allow parachutes to be worn by the crew. Type approved in 1977 and produced as 1978 to 1985 model years. The following aerobatic maneuvers are approved: chandelles, steep turns, barrel rolls, snap rolls, loops, vertical reversements, lazy eights, spins, <b>aileron</b> <b>rolls,</b> Immelmann turns, Cuban Eights and stalls (except whip stalls).|$|R
40|$|Flight {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on the OS 2 U- 2 seaplane with simple circular-arc-type ailerons directly connected to the actuating torque tube. Two aileron test installations were made, differing only in the inclination of the projecting surface with the wing's upper surface. The lateral-control characteristics of the airplane were determined from data obtained in stalls and rudder-fixed <b>aileron</b> <b>rolls.</b> The revised <b>ailerons</b> were deficient in maximum rolling effectiveness, but were capable of controlling the rolling tendencies of the airplane near the stall...|$|R
50|$|The first Hydroplum was designed, {{built and}} test flown by Claude Tisserand during 1983. It has a wooden, fabric covered structure. The {{rectangular}} plan wing {{has a single}} spar and 2.8째 of dihedral. It has no <b>ailerons,</b> <b>roll</b> instead being controlled by 40% span spoilers. The wing is mounted above the hull on a flat sided pylon and braced by a single strut on each side to the lower hull longeron. The Hydroplum's Hirth engine is mounted in pusher configuration on the pylon with its propeller shaft in {{the plane of the}} wing. Its single-seat, unenclosed cockpit is immediately ahead of the pylon.|$|R

5000|$|An <b>aileron</b> <b>roll</b> is an {{unbalanced}} maneuver. As {{the roll}} begins, the aircraft {{will have a}} tendency to yaw away from the angle of bank, referred to as [...] "adverse yaw." [...] The pilot will usually need to apply the rudder {{in the direction of the}} bank to keep the aircraft balanced. An aircraft performing an <b>aileron</b> <b>roll</b> will actually fly along a slightly helical path, and a very light, positive g force will be maintained.|$|E

5|$|In air combat, the Phantom's {{greatest}} advantage was its thrust, which {{permitted a}} skilled pilot to {{engage and disengage}} from the fight at will. As a massive fighter aircraft designed to fire radar-guided missiles from beyond visual range, it lacked the agility of its Soviet opponents and was subject to adverse yaw during hard maneuvering. Although thus subject to irrecoverable spins during <b>aileron</b> <b>rolls,</b> pilots reported the aircraft to be very communicative and easy to fly {{on the edge of}} its performance envelope. In 1972, the F-4E model was upgraded with leading edge slats on the wing, greatly improving high angle of attack maneuverability at the expense of top speed.|$|R

At 1211:26 CDT, the NODAK 32 lead pilot reported, [...] "The target is descending and he is doing multiple <b>aileron</b> <b>rolls,</b> looks like he's out of control...in a severe descent, request an emergency descent to follow target." [...] The TULSA 13 pilot reported, [...] "It's soon to impact the ground; he is in a descending spiral." [...] The fighter planes were forced to break off their pursuit at this point and had to land at local airports, having reached the limit of their endurance.|$|R
50|$|The <b>aileron</b> <b>roll</b> is {{a crucial}} element of the Star Fox games, in which the player is urged to perform it on {{numerous}} occasions. However, in-game it is called a barrel roll.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>aileron</b> <b>roll</b> {{is similar}} to the slow roll, and the two {{maneuvers}} are often confused with each other. However, unlike a slow roll, an <b>aileron</b> <b>roll</b> is performed at the maximum roll rate, and is uncontrolled in the pitch axis. It consists of a constant attitude change during the maneuver; from the initial pitch-up to the plane following a slight corkscrew path as the nose drops, followed by the final pitch-up. If the pilot picks a reference point on the horizon, directly ahead of the plane, the nose will actually appear to trace a shape similar to the letter [...] "D" [...] above this reference point.|$|E

The controller's thumbstick are used to fly the starfighter in any direction. [...] By pressing the maneuver button and pushing the thumbstick in a direction, the player makes his or her fighter perform <b>aileron</b> <b>rolls</b> and 180-degrees turns (half-loops). Various button combinations control the Delta Saber's speed, allowing the craft to boost to great speeds with afterburners, coast on inertia without power, or match speed with a target. Certain maneuvers require the expenditure of shield energy, which protects starships from damage; an unshielded vessel under attack suffers damage to its armor. A ship is destroyed when its armor is depleted.|$|R
50|$|In {{aeronautics}} spoilerons, {{also known}} as spoiler ailerons, are flight control surfaces, specifically spoilers {{that can be used}} asymmetrically to provide adequate roll control if aileron action would produce excessive wing twist on a very flexible wing or if wide-span flaps prevent adequate <b>aileron</b> <b>roll</b> control.|$|E

50|$|Solo {{military}} jet demos, {{also known}} as tactical demo, feature one aircraft, usually a strike fighter or an advanced trainer. The demonstration focuses on the capabilities of modern aircraft used in combat operations. The display will usually demonstrate the aircraft's very short (and often very loud) rolls, fast speeds, slow approach speeds, {{as well as their}} ability to quickly make tight turns, to climb quickly, and their ability to be precisely controlled at a large range of speeds. Manoeuvres include <b>aileron</b> <b>rolls,</b> barrel rolls, hesitation rolls, Cuban-8s, tight turns, high-alpha flight, a high-speed pass, double Immelmans, and touch-and-gos. Tactical demos may include simulated bomb drops, sometimes with pyrotechnics on the ground for effect. Aircraft with special characteristics that give them unique capabilities will often display those in their demos; For example, Russian fighters with Thrust vectoring may be used to perform Pugachev's Cobra or the Kulbit, among other difficult manoeuvers that cannot be performed by other aircraft. Similarly, an F-22 pilot may hover his jet in the air with the nose pointed straight up, a Harrier or Osprey pilot may perform a vertical landing or vertical takeoff, and so on.|$|R
50|$|The Aqua Glider is {{made from}} wood and covered with doped {{aircraft}} fabric. The landing gear is fixed and consists {{of a pair of}} water skis. The aircraft uses spoilers instead of <b>ailerons</b> for <b>roll</b> control and features an all-flying tail and a trim system. The biplane wing employs a NACA 4412 airfoil.|$|R
5000|$|An {{aerodynamic}} twist can {{be introduced to}} the wing with the leading edge near the wing tip twisted downward. This is called washout and causes the wing root to stall before the wing tip. This makes the stall gentle and progressive.
