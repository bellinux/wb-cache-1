40|$|A novel {{technique}} for modeling the <b>aperture</b> <b>admittance</b> of open-ended waveguide structures radiating into a homogeneous, lossy dielectric half-space is presented. This technique combines both analytical and numerical approaches {{to express the}} <b>aperture</b> <b>admittance</b> as rational function of frequency and the relative permittivity of the external medium. The coefficients of the rational approximation, which depend upon the geometry of the waveguide and aperture, are determined in a very convenient manner from {{a relatively small number}} of computed admittances. This computed data is obtained via a full-wave movement method solution and, hence, includes the effects of radiation and energy storage in the near-field and evanescent waveguide modes. The accuracy of the numerical method is demonstrated by comparison with measured values. The new technique is successfully applied to obtain a model for the open-ended coaxial line geometry. The new model has important applications in the field of dielectric spectroscopy. In addition to yielding accurate solutions for the <b>aperture</b> <b>admittance</b> of the line as a function of the permittivity of the external medium, the model yields a unique solution to the inverse problem and permits a rigorous sensitivity and uncertainty analysis...|$|E
40|$|The Fourier {{transform}} {{technique is}} applied to derive an expression for the <b>aperture</b> <b>admittance</b> of a ground-plane-mounted, transverse electric and magnetic (TEM) modeexcited parallel-plate waveguide illuminating a perfectly conducting sheet. Based on the <b>aperture</b> <b>admittance</b> expression, an equivalent circuit is developed. It is shown {{that there is a}} 1 :l correspondence between elements of the equivalent circuit and higher order modes which exist in the parallel-plate waveguide formed by the ground plane and the reflecting sheet. For the special case where the configuration is treated as a microwave circuit tee junction, the waveguide widths which give the best impedance match are seen to be 0. 04 wavelength for the feed guide and 0. 03 wavelength for the second guide. Numerical computations of the reflection coefficient, derived from the <b>aperture</b> <b>admittance,</b> are compared with both the experimental and theoretical results of a similar problem which is solved by application of the geometrical theory of diffraction. General agreement between the two theories except for distances in the vicinity of integral multi-ples of one half-wavelength is obtained.

40|$|Waveguide slot antennas with {{longitudinal}} and transverse slots {{are analyzed}} using a rigorous method. The antennas {{are divided into}} regions, which are analyzed separately and matched by a moment method procedure. At the apertures between the regions, the electric fields are expanded in trigonometric basis functions. These apertures appear at the {{inside and outside of}} the slots in order to take the waveguide wall thickness into account. The shape of the exterior structure of the slot antenna is assumed to be a cylinder with arbitrary cross section. The exterior fields and currents are Fourier transformed along the structure. An integral equation is set up and solved in the spectral domain, i. e. where the time and longitudinal coordinates have been transformed. Its solution is found numerically with the moment method, since general cylindrical structures are treated. The induced electric currents on the structure are expanded in subsectional basis functions formed as triangles and pulses. The spectral magnetic field and the spectral mutual admittances are determined from the computed values of the spectral induced currents. The spectral mutual <b>aperture</b> <b>admittances</b> are inverse transformed and included in the overall slot antenna analysis...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, we have {{investigated}} antenna elements that allow broadband operation and are relatively compact, while determining methods by which their geometry may be adapted, or various points in their structure loaded, {{in order to}} form reconfigurable antennas that may allow their polarisation or matching characteristics to be electronically altered. Much of the work undertaken has involved evanescent open-ended waveguide antennas, whereby the waveguide is operated below its cutoff frequency. Various novel matching methods have been developed, involving: (i) Using the Imaginary Smith Chart to design a match to the <b>aperture</b> <b>admittance</b> of an open-ended wave guide, and thereby to free space, with the match made reconfigurable through loading of the structure using a varactor diode. (ii) Use of capacitive coupling between an open-ended waveguide antenna's coaxial input feed and capacitive obstacles placed across the aperture of the antenna to obtain a broadband match, with polarisation-agile performance possible through varying the ex citations supplied at the input ports of the antenna. (iii) Application of band-pass filter techniques to design a match to the <b>aperture</b> <b>admittance</b> of an open-ended waveguide, {{through the use of}} alternating propagating/evanescent sections or by loading the antenna with capacitive obstacles. Radar cross-section reconfigurability is demonstrated, through a printed obstacle with switch implemented at the aperture of the waveguide. The Vivaldi antenna has also been the subject of investigation in the project, with the most notable result obtained being the design of an antipodal Vivaldi antenna loaded by shorted slotline stubs that have a variable capacitor placed across them; this allows wideband operation but with a tuneable rejection band, which enables rejection of cellular and ISM bands.

The groove may be empty or loaded with a lossy material {{which may or}} may not completely fill the cavity. For the partially loaded groove, the filling material is assumed electrically dense so that the standard impedance boundary condition is applicable at the top surface of the material. Employing a full-wave analysis, integral equations are derived for the tangential components of the electric field over the aperture.

40|$|Abstract-The {{transverse}} operator {{method is}} used for the analysis of an open-ended rectangular waveguide, in particular as a radiating element. It is shown that the method allows a systematic formulation of problems involving discontinuities whether they are radiating or not. The numerical results concerning the admittance and power patterns of a waveguide aperture surrounded by an infinite conducting flange are compared to those available in the literature, and a good agreement is observed. INTRODUCTTON PERTURE antennas find many applications in A aeronautics, diathermy, and hyperthermia as well as in phased-array systems [l]. The basic radiating structure is the open end of a waveguide, generally terminated by an infinite metallic flange. This subject has been studied by many authors using different approaches such as the variational, correlation matrix, and integral equation methods [1]-[6]. The correlation matrix method proposed by MacPhie is based on the principle of energy conservation through the aperture [5], while Gardiol obtains the <b>aperture</b> <b>admittance</b> using an integral equation method based on the magnetic current concept [6]. The method proposed in this paper, based on the transverse fields calculation through the use of an operator, called the transverse operator, was introduced for the first time by Marcuvitz [7]. The tangential field continuity condition in the spectral domain leads to a simple relation between the electric and magnetic fields. The field expansion in a series of normal transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes allows the <b>aperture</b> <b>admittance</b> to be obtained, and the radiation patterns are then determined. THEORY The structure to be studied is that of Fig. 1 where the rectangular waveguide is terminated by an infinite conducting flange. The transverse electromagnetic fields 4 satisfy the following relationship [7]...|$|E

The fields in the waveguide and half-space are expanded {{in terms of the}} waveguide modes and the Weberâ€“Schafheitlin discontinuous integrals, respectively. Continuity of the tangential aperture fields yields matrix equations for the expansion coefficients and the matrix elements consist of double infinite integrals and double infinite series of Bessel functions, which are calculated efficiently by applying the asymptotic approximation of the Bessel function. Numerical results are presented for various physical quantities, such as the <b>aperture</b> <b>admittance,</b> reflection coefficient of the incident wave, and magnitudes of higher-order mode waves, as well as the far-radiation pattern and aperture fields.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} undertaken {{to determine how}} large a ground plane is necessary to insure best possible experimental agreement with calculated values of admittance and susceptance for a rectangular waveguide-fed aperture. One method of calculating the <b>aperture</b> <b>admittance</b> is briefly outlined. The experimental work is outlined and the results presented in graphical and tabular form. It was found that a minimum flange of 2 wavelengths in the directions perpendicular to the broad dimension of the waveguide is required to insure agreement of the conductance to within 2 $ and the susceptance to within 5 $ of the calculated values. It was found that in the direction perpendicular to the narrow dimension of the waveguide, a flange of total width of 0. 9 x was still large enough to insure this same agreement, even though the aperture width was slightly over 0. 8 x. The experiment also showed that type of conductor is not a critical factor...|$|E

Current methods are inaccurate, prohibitively expensive, or compromise sample integrity. This work presents a nondestructive {{system for the}} on-line measurement of cell concentration in micro-porous polymer scaffolds. The system is based on measuring the reflection coefficient of the sample with an open-ended coaxial probe over a frequency range of 10 - 200 MHz. An <b>aperture</b> <b>admittance</b> model is used to extract the complex permittivity from the reflection measurement. Then, effective medium approximation is used to relate the complex permittivity to the cell properties and concentration of the sample. The system detected the relative cell concentration differences between micro-porous polymer scaffolds seeded with progressively greater number of pre-osteoblast cells. Proliferation of pre-ostoblasts over 14 days was measured within 56 scaffolds by the system and a concurrent DNA assay.

40|$|An {{open-ended}} coaxial probe is a probe {{consists of}} {{inner and outer}} conductors with radius, respectively. The open end of the coaxial line is terminated by a semi-infinite sample on a ground plane. In general, the medium between the conductors is filled by free space or lossless materials. The application {{is based on the}} principle that a reflected signal through the coaxial opening will carry the desired information about the material sample at terminal surface. Thus, if the <b>aperture</b> <b>admittance</b> or reflection coefficient characteristics can be precisely formulated then, it {{can be used as a}} probe for the characterization of material samples. Nevertheless, there exists no completely analytical relationship between the reflection coefficient and the permittivity of the material under test. Various methods have been used to relate the reflection coefficient data to the dielectric properties of the sample in the past. Subsequent considerable efforts were made to further improve these models. The methods range from simple closed-form equivalent circuit model to rigorous analytical technique. In this chapter, the closed-form equivalent circuit admittance models and rigorous integral admittance models is reviewed and used as a function to relate the reflection coefficient and the permittivity of the material under test...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{the study of}} {{nanoparticle}} (NP) systems has become a large and interesting research area due to their novel properties and functionalities, which {{are different from those}} of the bulk materials, and also their potential applications in different fields. It is vital to understand the behaviour and properties of nano-materials aiming at implementing nanotechnology, controlling their behaviour and designing new material systems with superior performance. Physical characterisation of NPs falls into two main categories, property and structure analysis, where the properties of the NPs cannot be studied without the knowledge of size and structure. The direct measurement of the electrical properties of metal NPs presents a key challenge and necessitates the use of innovative experimental techniques. There have been numerous reports of two/four point resistance measurements of NPs films and also electrical conductivity of NPs films using the interdigitated microarray (IDA) electrode. However, using microwave techniques such as open ended coaxial probe (OCP) and microwave dielectric resonator (DR) for electrical characterisation of metallic NPs are much more accurate and effective compared to other traditional techniques. This is because they are inexpensive, convenient, non-destructive, contactless, hazardless (i. e. at low power) and require no special sample preparation. This research is the first attempt to determine the microwave properties of Pt and Au NP films, which were appealing materials for nano-scale electronics, using the aforementioned microwave techniques. The ease of synthesis, relatively cheap, unique catalytic activities and control over the size and the shape were the main considerations in choosing Pt and Au NPs for the present study. The initial phase of this research was to implement and validate the <b>aperture</b> <b>admittance</b> model for the OCP measurement through experiments and 3 D full wave simulation using the commercially available Ansoft High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS), followed by the electrical characterisation of synthesised Pt NP films using the novel miniature fabricated OCP technique. The results obtained from this technique provided the inspiration to synthesise and evaluate the microwave properties of Au NPs. The findings from this technique provided the motivation to characterise both the Pt and Au NP films using the DR technique. Unlike the OCP technique, the DR method is highly sensitive but the achievable measurement accuracy is limited since this technique does not have broadband frequency capability like the OCP method. The results obtained from the DR technique show a good agreement with the theoretical prediction. In the last phase of this research, a further validation of the <b>aperture</b> <b>admittance</b> models on different types OCP (i. e. RG- 405 and RG- 402 cables and SMA connector) have been carried out on the developed 3 D full wave models using HFSS software, followed by the development of universal models for the aforementioned OCPs based on the same 3 D full wave models.

40|$|The {{object of}} this report is to {{calculate}} the admittance and the radiation pattern of aperture antennas fed by waveguides of arbitrary cross-section and radiating into dielectric slabs, whose constitutive parameters may be functions of position along the direction normal to the slab faces. For a given aperture field distribution the antenna <b>aperture</b> <b>admittance</b> and the radiation field are expressed here, for the first time, in terms of two auxiliary quantities {{directly related to the}} plane wave reflection and transmission coefficients of the dielectric slab. These quantities are the input admittance of the dielectric slab and the ratio of the total electric field amplitude transmitted {{at one end of the}} slab to the transverse field at the other, both calculated for plane waves as a function of incident propagation direction. This approach introduces a great simplification in the solution of the problem, particularly in the case of an antenna radiating into an inhomogeneous dielectric slab. A simple and powerful method has been devised for the computation of the input admittance of an inhomogeneous dielectric slab as well as for the electric field ratio. In this case the impracticability of obtaining analytical results has necessitated the use of numerical techniques. Examples of the application of the theory to typical dielectric slabs are given and the results are discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|A 2. 2 mm {{open-ended}} coaxial probe {{is selected}} {{to explore the}} broadband measurement of complex permittivity ranging from kHz up to GHz. The measurements are conducted in three different frequency ranges, i. e., high frequency (HF, 500 MHz ~ 20 GHz), medium frequency (MF, 10 MHz ~ 1 GHz), and low frequency (LF, 1 kHz ~ 15 MHz), in view of pertinent <b>aperture</b> <b>admittance</b> models, feasible measurement principles, and required calibrations for system biases. These considerations are discussed and described in turn from the high frequency measurements to low frequency tests. Verification of the associated measurement techniques in the three operating frequency regimes is provided by experiments on pure ethanol and methanol liquids {{as well as on}} NaCl solutions of different concentrations. These testing techniques are also applied to measure the broadband dielectric spectrum of kaolinite slurry; simple analyses focusing on subtracting the influence of DC conductivity and multiple relaxations are presented. A complex permittivity spectrum from 1 kHz to 3 GHz is measured in kaolinite sediment of different structures using the slim-form open-ended coaxial probe. The sediment structure is manipulated by changing the pore-fluid pH. When the pH is below the isoelectrical point of the edge surface, IEPedge, the structure of face-to-edge (EF) flocculation is promoted in voluminous sediment (Group A samples). A higher dielectric constant due to bulk water polarization is measured because of the higher water content. As the pH is increased to greater than IEPedge, dense sediment with face-to-face (FF) aggregation is produced (Group B samples) and a lower dielectric constant is obtained. In bound water and spatial polarization, higher relaxation strength and longer relaxation time are observed in the Group B samples, which can be attributed to more negatively charged surfaces and denser packing. Fluid conductivity dominates the global conductivity of the sediment in the Group A samples so that the Î² value, i. e., the ratio between the conductivities of the sediment and the fluid, is smaller than 1. The Î² value is greater than 1 in the Group B samples owing to an overcompensation of surface conduction. Sedimentation behavior of two kaolinite samples with distinct fabric associations is characterized using mechanical and electromagnetic wave-based techniques. The two different fabric formations, the edge-to-face (EF) flocculated structure (i. e., sample A) and the dispersed and deflocculated structure (i. e., sample B), were regulated by changing the pH of the pore fluid and are produced. The anisotropy of shear wave velocity and DC conductivity was not observed in the sediment of sample A because of EF isotropic fabric associations but it was detected in sample B as a result of face-to-face (FF) aggregation. An open card-house structure of the sample A sediment results in a higher relaxation strength of the bulk water, Î”Kw owing to a higher water content; the smaller Î”Kw measured in the sample B sediment indicates denser packing. In both samples, sediment consolidation gives rise to a decrease in the bulk-water relaxation strength but an increase in the bound-water relaxation strength owing to increasing particle content. In response to sediment consolidation, the sediment conductivity of sample A continuously decreases because of the reduced contribution from the fluid conductivity. In sample B, the surface conduction via the overlapped double layer overcompensates such a decreased contribution so that the sediment conductivity increases with increasing particle content. The slim-form open-ended coaxial probe is also used to conduct a local dielectric measurement. The measured results, i. e. dielectric relaxation strength of bulk water, Î”Kw, and the DC conductivity of the saturated sample, Ïƒmix, are jointly used to characterize the spatial variability of different specimens including glass beads, sand and mica samples, and kaolinte sediments with two different fabric associations. The pore distribution along the sample depth can be reflected from the measured Î”Kw, and the local porosity can be estimated based on the mixing rules. The directional feature of the interconnected pores is captured in the totruosity which is derived from the measured Ïƒmix. In the kaolinite sediments, the ratio between the sediment and the pore-fluid conductivity not only reveals the spatial variability of the sediment packing but also the relative contribution of the fluid conductivity and surface conduction to the global sediment conductivity...|$|E
