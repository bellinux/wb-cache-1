500|$|In {{a review}} of the eighth through tenth volumes of the manga, ANN lambasted the fact the fights were {{frequently}} [...] "interrupted by long-winded (and sometimes redundant) explanations of strategies and special techniques", but praised the visual presentation of the fights, noting that [...] "the fights are staged with a clear eye for geography, movement and the human form, and are bursting with so much visual energy that not even the flashbacks and tedious explanations can dampen them". For the visuals in the anime, ANN made note of the fight between Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha in episodes 132–134, noting the [...] "impressiveness of the Sasuke fight's visuals", in which [...] "Naruto clones explode from a lake like ninja-shaped surface-to-air missiles and glowing energy limbs ambush enemies from underground and cling to rock faces like neon prehensile tails". Although ANN praised the animators who [...] "put <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>love</b> they could into the fight", it criticized the slow plot pacing that led up to the fight, and the fight's tedious structure.|$|E

[...] Kazinsky revealed that Herc and Chuck's pet bulldog was del Toro's idea and said, [...] "The dog's name was Max, ironically, and we ended up using Max for so many things. The story was that Herc and Chuck have difficulty communicating, that they communicated via the dog, and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>love</b> that they couldn't show each other they would show the dog." [...] The role was originally written for Ron Perlman, but del Toro decided the scenes between Perlman's Herc and Hunnam's Raleigh [...] "might start to feel like Sons of Anarchy 2.0".|$|E

[...] She also stated the song was a progress from the sound of her previous album, Hard Candy. Jim Farber from the New York Daily News considered that the song is [...] "a pure snap of bubble gum, closer to an early single like 'Burning Up' than any of her more recent club hits.

[...] "Musically it's a pretty joyful four minutes, featuring bouncing beats, acoustic riffs and Gwen Stefani-style cheerleader chants, but there's something a bit flat about Madonna's delivery. Given <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>love</b> she's demanding, you'd think she'd be more excited." [...] Speaking of the rap part, he thought that [...] "Minaj certainly does her best, her typically frantic rap an exercise in squeezing as many words into a 10-second space as possible, while MIA's more laconic drawl loses momentum." [...] Chris Willman of Reuters called it [...] "risible" [...] and infectious: [...] "Everything here is as dumb as the titular spelling, but the campiness has its charm, at least if you like the old musicals that some of the tracking shots here are paying homage to". MTV News journalist Bradley Stern wrote about the [...] "Hey Mickey" [...] comparisons, complimenting the guest rapping of Minaj and M.I.A. even though he felt it was [...] "one of the album’s least compelling moments". In a review of MDNA, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph felt that the prime purpose of the [...] "lightest, frothiest track" [...] from the album was to represent next generation's female pop stars.
