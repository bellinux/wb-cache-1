5000|$|Leggett {{joined the}} Budokwai in London in 1932, {{training}} primarily under Yukio Tani, {{who would have}} a profound influence on the young man. Biographers Anthony Dunne and Richard Bowen (2003) relate that on one occasion, Leggett [...] "looked in at the Budokwai, but, feeling a bit off colour and deciding not to train, walked away. He met Tani who asked where he was going. Responding to the five feet three-inch Tani, Leggett said, 'Well, you know, I thought I'd give the training a miss tonight. I'm a bit off colour and a rest will do me good.' 'Now, Leggett San, if a man with evil intent rushes up {{to you in the}} street with a hammer, what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say?</b> I'm sorry but I don't feel too good. Can you attack me next week?' Leggett turned on his heel {{and went back to the}} Budokwai. It was incidents of this nature, and there were a number, which made a major contribution to his steely self-control and determination" [...] (p. 325).|$|E
5000|$|Various {{media outlets}} {{initially}} characterised {{the issue as}} girlish rivalry but later blamed it on bullying and racism. As time progressed, the majority of media coverage of Jade became negative, although accusations of racism were superseded by those of bullying. An editorial published by The Daily Mirror on 18 January 2007 called Beauty v Bigot, deplored what they referred to as [...] "disgraceful racist bullying of Big Brothers Shilpa Shetty", and criticised Channel 4 management for maintaining {{that there was not}} a racial element to the bullying. The British tabloids mostly concentrated on the comments made by Jade, rather than those made by Jack, Danielle, and Jo and the bullying from them. For instance, when Jade and Shilpa were arguing over Oxo cubes, Shilpa pleaded with Jo for assistance by saying [...] "Jo, I mean, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something here what is happening here?" [...] - to which Jo responded by bursting out laughing. Jermaine Jackson, another housemate witnessing the situation, later said, [...] "When all this was going on I saw Danielle and Jo laughing and then branded them as the allies".|$|E

5000|$|An amateur musician, {{the writer}} {{returned}} {{to the subject of}} music, and his life-long passion for folk music in particular, to write the biography of Bob Dylan {{on the occasion of the}} folk rock idol's seventieth birthday. Published in 2011 it was the first of Epstein's books to reach an extensive international audience, in editions published in English, French, Italian, Portuguese, and other languages.

In an interview with Mara Meisel of the Pittsburgh Press in 1984 Epstein said: “I still have doubts about how permanent my poetry is going to be. But I always had confidence that poetry was the most important thing in my life…No great poet has not had an extraordinary command of the language, all of history and the manners and morals of his age. How <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something that’s going to be significant to people if you aren’t well-grounded in history and in a broad sense of human nature?” ...|$|E
