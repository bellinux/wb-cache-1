25|$|The Marines, {{believing the}} island was safe, were caught off guard by the attack. The gunfire by the two assailants struck the two baseball-playing Marines {{as well as a}} tent and dozens of cases of soft drinks. After {{shooting}} at the Marines initially, reports state the men then drove to another location and then shot again. According to accounts, a Marine sentry returned fire with an M16A2 rifle and company commander Captain Matthew S. Reid returned fire with a sidearm, with the former's gunfire disabling the truck. The two Kuwaiti gunmen were shot, with one of them exiting the vehicle on the passenger side with several gunshot wounds. Reid and the senior-most Marine enlisted on the island, First Sergeant Timothy Ruff, and Company Gunnery Sergeant Wayne A. Hertz then closed with and shot the gunman several more times, killing them. Ruff and other Marines, including Hertz, then extracted the wounded driver of the truck from out of the vehicle. That gunman also died. Before the second gunman died, the Marines walked up to his body and stood over him. Surrounded by U.S. Marines, the mortally-wounded gunman laid dying on the ground <b>and</b> <b>muttered</b> a few phrases in Arabic before finally expiring.|$|E

[...] "He was small in stature and I {{could not help but}} detect the smell of alcohol on his breath as he {{introduced}} himself to me. I was even more surprised when he announced we would stay put to conduct the medical examination. [...] "He took my blood pressure, looked at the reading <b>and</b> <b>muttered</b> 'that's fine'. Then something happened that to this day I still cannot get over. He asked me to bend down and touch my toes. [...] "Trying not to show my surprise, I did exactly as he asked and as I lifted my head he spoke again, this time to announce 'you've passed'. That was it, my Liverpool medical." ...|$|E
500|$|Marshall's wit is {{best remembered}} for a phrase he {{introduced}} to the American lexicon. While presiding over a Senate session in 1914, Marshall responded to earlier comments from Senator Joseph L. Bristow in which the senator provided {{a long list of}} what he felt the country needed. Marshall reportedly leaned over <b>and</b> <b>muttered</b> to one of his clerks, [...] "What this country needs is more of this; what this country needs is more of that" [...] and quipped loudly enough others to overhear, [...] "What this country needs is a really good five-cent cigar." [...] Marshall’s remark was popularized and widely circulated among a network of newspapers. Other accounts later embellished the story, including the exact situation that prompted his comment. In 1922 Marshall explained that the five-cent cigar was a metaphor for simpler times [...] and [...] "buckling down to thrift and work." ...|$|E

500|$|Masterton {{suffered}} a severe internal brain injury {{during the first}} period of Minnesota's January 13, 1968, game against the Oakland Seals at the Met Center. He carried the puck up the ice at full speed, passing it off as two Seals defenders, Larry Cahan and Ron Harris, converged on him. [...] Masterton was knocked backward in the resulting collision and landed on his head. Like most players of his era, he wasn't wearing a helmet. Referee Wally Harris compared the hit to an explosion, adding [...] "he was checked hard, but I'm sure it wasn't a dirty play." [...] The force of the impact caused Masterton to bleed from his nose, ears and mouth. [...] The impact of the hit caused him to lose consciousness before he hit the ice; according to some accounts, he briefly came to <b>and</b> <b>muttered,</b> [...] "Never again, never again" [...] before passing back out. [...] He received treatment {{on the ice and}} in the dressing room before being rushed to Fairview-Southdale Hospital.|$|E
2500|$|According to the {{memories}} of Svetlana Aliluyeva, Chiaureli approached her father with the idea to combine the fate of his son, Yakov Dzhugashvili, in the plot. Stalin promptly rejected this. Soviet actor Artyom Karapetian claimed Chiaureli's wife, actress Veriko Anjaparidze, told him Stalin was so outraged when he heard of this that Lavrentiy Beria – who was standing nearby – [...] reached into his trousers' pocket, [...] "presumably, for his gun." [...] The director's daughter, Sofiko Chiaureli, recounted that her father [...] "knew he was saved" [...] when Stalin wiped tears from {{his eyes as he}} watched Gelovani descend from the plane <b>and</b> <b>muttered</b> [...] "If only I had gone to Berlin." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{low point}} in the tour {{occurred}} during India's match against Minor Counties at Lord's. Lala Amarnath had been nursing a back injury during the game. Vizzy had Amarnath pad up, but didn't put him in to bat as a succession of other batsmen were sent in ahead of him, which prevented Amarnath from resting his injury. Amarnath was finally put in to bat {{at the end of}} the day. Visibly angry after returning to the dressing room, he threw his kit into his bag <b>and</b> <b>muttered</b> in Punjabi, [...] "I know what is transpiring". Vizzy took this as an affront, and conspired with team manager Major Jack Brittain-Jones to have Lala Amarnath sent back from the tour without playing the First Test. It is also alleged that in the First Test against the England, Vizzy offered Mushtaq Ali a gold watch to run out Vijay Merchant.|$|E

2500|$|In the bedroom, Mueller noted {{there was}} indeed a large knife beneath the bed; he also saw an open drawer which, upon closer inspection, {{contained}} scores of Polaroid pictures—many of which were of human bodies {{in various stages of}} dismemberment. Mueller noted the decor indicated they had been taken in the very apartment in which they were standing. He walked into the living room to show them to his partner, uttering the words, [...] "These are for real." [...] When Dahmer saw that Mueller was holding several of his Polaroids, he fought with the officers in an effort to resist arrest. The officers quickly overpowered him, cuffed his hands behind his back, and called a second squad car for backup. At this point, Mueller opened the refrigerator to reveal the freshly severed head of a black male on the bottom shelf. As Dahmer lay pinned on the floor beneath Rauth, he turned his head towards the officers <b>and</b> <b>muttered</b> the words: [...] "For what I did I should be dead." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, Reynolds {{clashed with}} Maj. Gen. Hooker, his {{predecessor}} at I Corps, but {{by this time}} the commander of the Army of the Potomac. Hooker originally placed the I Corps on the extreme left of the Union line, southeast of Fredericksburg, hoping to threaten and distract the Confederate right. On May 2, Hooker changed his mind and ordered the corps to conduct a daylight march nearly 20 miles to swing around and become the extreme right flank of the army, to the northwest of the XI Corps. The march was delayed by faulty communications and by the need to move stealthily to avoid Confederate contact. Thus, the I Corps was not yet in position when the XI Corps was surprised and overrun by Lt. Gen. Thomas J. [...] "Stonewall" [...] Jackson's flank attack, a setback that destroyed Hooker's nerve for offensive action. Hooker called a council of war on May 4 in which Reynolds voted to proceed with the battle, but although the vote was three to two for offensive action, Hooker decided to retreat. Reynolds, who had gone to sleep after giving his proxy vote to Meade, woke up <b>and</b> <b>muttered</b> loud enough for Hooker to hear, [...] "What was the use of calling us together at this time of night when he intended to retreat anyhow?" [...] The 17,000-man I Corps was not engaged at Chancellorsville and suffered only 300 casualties during the entire campaign.|$|E
2500|$|Amarnath was {{controversially}} {{sent back}} from the 1936 tour of England by the captain, the Maharajkumar of Vizianagram, for [...] "indiscipline". Amarnath and others allege {{it was due to}} politics. Vizzy, the Maharajkumar of Vizianagram, was named the captain for Indian cricket team for the 1936 tour of England, a post that he secured after lobbying and manipulation. Unfortunately, his desperately poor captaincy on the field resulted in even the normally reserved British press commenting on it. Some of the senior players in the squad, including Lala Amarnath, C. K. Nayudu and Vijay Merchant, were critical of Vizzy's playing abilities and captaincy, and the team was split between those who supported and criticised the captain. The low point in the tour occurred during India's match against Minor Counties at Lord's. Lala Amarnath had been nursing a back injury during the game. Vizzy had Amarnath pad up, but didn't put him in to bat as a succession of other batsmen were sent in ahead of him, which prevented Amarnath from resting his injury. Amarnath was finally put in to bat {{at the end of the}} day. Visibly angry after returning to the dressing room, he threw his kit into his bag <b>and</b> <b>muttered</b> in Punjabi, [...] "I know what is transpiring". Vizzy took this as an affront, and conspired with team manager Major Jack Brittain-Jones to have Lala Amarnath sent {{back from the}} tour without playing the first test match. It is also alleged that in the 1st Test against the England, Vizzy offered Mushtaq Ali a gold watch to run out Vijay Merchant.|$|E
