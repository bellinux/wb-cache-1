40|$|The Italian orange fruit export {{development}} outside EU {{countries has}} required commercial agreements regarding the restriction of parasites spread especially Mediterranean fruit fly. The correct use of cold treatment during the shipment {{is used to}} satisfy this requirement. This paper reports {{the results of a}} simulated refrigerated transport of citrus fruits (14600 kg of ‘Tarocco’ oranges) in a 40 ft refrigerated container. Temperatures have been monitored inside the refrigerated container in different positions of the load (in the air, in the pallet and in the fruits) using 40 innovative direct-to-digital temperature probes. Moreover, an innovative package (with an increased vented surface) was compared to the standard boxes. Results show that the difference of average temperature between the temperature probes in head space was less than 0. 5 °C. Temperature peaks showed the on/off cycle of the <b>automatic</b> <b>defrosting</b> <b>system.</b> Though temperature probes placed on the floor showed a good homogeneity, the air temperature reached a minimum level of about - 0. 8 °C, near the cold air outlet, which is considered too low for the oranges cold storage. The vented boxes allowed a more rapid cooling, lowering the overall thermal resistance of fruit boxes, and so making fruits mostly affected by the cold air temperature near the air cooler outlet...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper are {{discussed}} the results of simulated refrigerated transport of citrus fruit at industrial scale. Fruit temperature distribution in a refrigerated cargo (reefer) has been studied {{in order to reduce}} the temperature difference in the load, to increase quality and shelf life after shipment. The mean temperature difference between the probes placed in the head space was shorter than 0. 5 °C while graphic peaks showed the temperature increase due to the on/off cycle of the <b>automatic</b> <b>defrosting</b> <b>system.</b> The temperature was also more than 10 °C higher than the mean registered value, and leads to a partial warming of the product. This undesired effect appears less important when the distance of the probe is higher respect to the air-cooler. Data concerning the probes placed on the container floor demonstrated a good result in terms of temperature homogeneity, but temperature reached a minimum level of about - 0, 8 °C (when the cooling system started) which can be considered too low for orange fruits storage, due to the risk of cold damage rising (about - 1, 0 °C). Vented boxes allow a more rapid cooling and a more accurate temperature control, probably due to the presence of the vent openings and, consequently, the less thermal resistance. Indeed citrus fruits placed in the vented boxes show a temperature variation like the environment cold air, while the fruits in the classic boxes show a great inertia to modify their temperature. Therefore, using the vented boxes need a precise control of the container air temperature, as any air temperature fluctuation can lead to a fruit quality decrease. The container for citrus fruit transport has to be suitable for cooling; every container for food freezing is not suitable for the scope; indeed the low evaporation temperatures could lead the rising of fruit cold damages...|$|E

The <b>system</b> is designed {{to work as a}} commercial refrigeration system for low temperature applications including freezing and defrost cycles. A manual and <b>automatic</b> <b>defrost</b> control has been designed and tested. The calculated values are the air- and refrigerant-side capacities. The tests have shown that the system is able to accomplish all desired test conditions. The performance of the evaporator was evaluated continuously during testing. Its performance degraded constantly by accumulation of frost during each frosting cycle, which resulted in the loss of superheat towards the end of each cycle. The defrost operation could not restore the full capacity of the evaporator. The defrost cycle consists out of two phases, melting the ice and re-cooling the coil. The first phase melts all the ice of the coil but the drainage of the resulting water is incomplete. The re-cooling phase freezes the amount of water residue on the evaporator coil, which causes an accelerated frost formation in the following freezing cycle. All over this behavior causes an accelerated reduction in evaporator capacity and therefore earlier superheat loss. It has been investigated for two air flow rates. The comparison of cycles with different air flow rates showed that with an increased air flow rate the frost density increases and the free flow area of the air passage in the evaporator decreases more slowly...|$|R

Some interest is now turned towards fluids with low global warming potential (GWP) like carbon dioxide. The performances of CO 2 can be interesting in transcritical cycles, particularly for domestic hot water (DHW) production. However, this cycle requires the use of devices operating under high pressures. The Heating and Cooling Plant (HCP) is intended to produce domestic hot water and to heat and cool residential and small office buildings. The HCP presents an innovative design of the refrigeration circuit and an innovative <b>defrosting</b> <b>system.</b> It is equipped with three heat exchangers: a water condenser (or gas cooler for transcritical CO 2) and a water evaporator linked to three tanks and an air heat exchanger that can be either condenser or evaporator in order to balance productions and needs. When operating with the air evaporator under frosting conditions, some heat is gained by subcooling the refrigerant and stored in the cooling tank. When the cold tank is hot enough the HCP mode changes, to work with the water evaporator while the air evaporator is being defrosted. Two HCPs (CO 2 and HFC) have been modelled using TRNSYS and EXCEL. The simulations enable to estimate the performances of both machines and to construct a frosting - defrosting sequence. The results show that both machines see their average COP increasing but that CO 2 is 50 % less efficient.

The cabinet was modified so that either <b>defrost</b> <b>system</b> could be deployed, leaving the rest of the system operation untouched. Performance of the cabinet during EN 23953 standard tests was compared. Total energy consumption during the tests was 40 % lower with the novel defrost. This was partly due to elimination of the use of electrical defrost power (which reduced direct electrical power by 39 %). Since the system leads to lower liquid refrigerant temperatures at the expansion valve there is a saving in compressor power for the same refrigeration effect and as the defrost is quicker, the temperature excursions inside the cabinet are smaller, reducing the amount of heat which has to be removed after a defrost. The cabinet can also be run at a higher evaporating temperature, further reducing energy consumption...|$|R
