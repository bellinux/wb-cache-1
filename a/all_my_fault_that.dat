That you, Arthur Fletcher, should marry the widow of that man,--the woman that he had thrust so far into the mire that she can never again be clean;--you, the chosen one, the bright star among us all;--you, whose wife should be the fairest, the purest, the tenderest of us all, a flower that has yet been hardly breathed on! While I-- Arthur," [...] she said, [...] "I know my duty better than that. I will not seek an escape from my punishment in that way,--nor will I allow you to destroy yourself. You have my word as a woman that it shall not be so. Now I do not mind your knowing whether I love you or no." [...] He stood silent before her, not able for the moment {{to go on with}} his prayer. [...] "And now, go," [...] she said. [...] "God bless you, and give you some day a fair and happy wife. And, Arthur, do not come again to me. If you will let it be so, I shall have a delight in seeing you;--but not if you come as you have come now. And, Arthur, spare me with papa. Do not let him think that it is <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> <b>that</b> I cannot do the thing which he wishes." [...] Then she left the room before he could say another word to her.|$|E
5000|$|On 13 September 1982, while {{returning}} home from their farm in Rocagel, France, Stéphanie {{and her mother had}} a car accident. Grace died the next day, on September 14, while Stéphanie sustained a hairline fracture of a neck vertebra. Although the official version was that Grace suffered a stroke while driving, it was rumoured that Stéphanie, who had to miss her mother's funeral due to her recovery, was the one actually driving. Stéphanie herself refused to speak publicly about her mother's death until 1989, when she gave an interview to the author Jeffrey Robinson, insisting that the story was untrue. She said, [...] "There was {{a lot of pressure on}} me because everyone was saying that I had been driving the car, that it was <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> <b>that</b> I'd killed my mother... It's not easy when you're 17 to live with that." [...] She did not discuss the subject again until a 2002 interview with the French magazine Paris Match in which she repeated her earlier denial, and discussed the trauma of being beside her mother at the time of the accident. She said, [...] "Not only did I go through the horrible trauma of losing my mother at a very young age, but I was beside her at the moment of the accident. Nobody can imagine how much I've suffered, and still suffer." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{had neither}} {{the good sense}} nor the good feeling to know <b>that</b> this was <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> and <b>that</b> if I had been easier with Joe, Joe {{would have been easier}} with me. I felt {{impatient}} of him and out of temper with him; in which condition he heaped coals of fire on my head.|$|R
6000|$|... "We have <b>all</b> our <b>faults,</b> <b>my</b> lord. <b>That</b> of play hath been condoned {{over and}} over again in gentlemen of our rank. Having heartily forgiven my brother, surely I cannot presume to be your lordship's judge in the matter; and instead of playing and losing, I wish {{sincerely}} that you had both played and won!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{negative}} {{stories about}} the shoot that were turning up in the Hollywood press were coming, we found out later, from a source at Film Finances-which was the completion bond company on the film. Their lawyer was a guy named Steve Ransohoff, whose father was Martin Ransohoff-who was Ray Stark's friend and partner. ... I thought it was quite extraordinary, because the stories were doing two things - they were making me and the whole project look like it was completely {{out of control and}} <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> and <b>that</b> Film Finance, the completion guarantors, were the only thing holding it together-the people trying to bring control to it... the fact was, they were absolutely useless.|$|R
6000|$|... "Please don't scold the nurse," [...] she said, [...] "nor say {{anything}} to Mrs. Barker. It is <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> I thought <b>that</b> both the nurse and child looked dreadfully bored with each other, and I borrowed the little fellow {{for a while to}} try and amuse him. At least I haven't made him cry, have I, dear?" [...] The last epithet, it is needless to say, was addressed to the little creature in her lap, but in its tender modulation it touched the father's quick sympathies as if he had shared it with the child. [...] "You see," [...] she said softly, disengaging the baby fingers from her necklace, [...] "that OUR sex {{is not the only one}} tempted by jewelry and glitter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said I, [...] "this that I {{have got}} to say is very difficult, and I know very well I {{have no right to}} be saying it. After what passed {{between the two of us}} last Friday, I have no manner of right. We have got so ravelled up (and <b>all</b> by <b>my</b> <b>fault)</b> <b>that</b> I know very well the least I could do is just to hold my tongue, which was what I {{intended}} fully, and there was nothing further from my thoughts than to have troubled you again. But, my dear, it has become merely necessary, and no way by it. You see, this estate of mine has fallen in, which makes me rather a better match; and the--the business would not have quite the same ridiculous-like appearance that it would before. Besides which, it's supposed that our affairs have got so much ravelled up (as I was saying) that it would be better to let them be the way they are. In my view, this part of the thing is vastly exaggerate, and if I were you I would not wear two thoughts on it. Only it's right I should mention the same, because there's no doubt it has some influence on James More. Then I think we were none so unhappy when we dwelt together in this town before. I think we did pretty well together. If you would look back, my dear--" ...|$|R
