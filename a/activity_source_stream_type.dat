40|$|Abstract—Streaming erasure codes encode a <b>source</b> <b>stream</b> to {{guarantee}} that each source packet is recovered within a fixed delay at the receiver over a burst-erasure channel. This paper introduces diversity embedded streaming erasure codes (DE-SCo), that provide a flexible tradeoff between the channel quality and receiver delay. When the channel conditions are good, the <b>source</b> <b>stream</b> is recovered with a low delay, whereas when the channel conditions are poor the <b>source</b> <b>stream</b> is still recovered, albeit with a larger delay. Information theoretic analysis of the underlying burst-erasure broadcast channel reveals that DE-SCo achieve the minimum possible delay for the weaker user, without sacrificing {{the performance of the}} stronger user. A larger class of multicast streaming erasure codes (MU-SCo) that achieve optimal tradeoff between rate, delay and erasure-burst length is also constructed. I...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{process of}} {{selecting}} invertebrate-based candidate metrics for the German stream assessment system is described. The {{aim was to}} identify metrics indicating degradation types other than organic pollution and acidification (“general degradation”). For 18 out of 24 German <b>stream</b> <b>types</b> a data base of roughly 2, 000 benthic invertebrate samples was generated; for each sample 79 metrics were calculated. Data on land use in the catchment were compiled for all sampling sites, together with data on hydromorphology for many sampling sites. Hydromorphological and land use parameters, which describe a clear gradient in the data sets were identified by Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS). Correlation analyses between land use/hydromorphological parameters and metric results were calculated separately for the individual <b>stream</b> <b>types.</b> Among those metrics best indicating catchment- and hydromorphological degradation {{in the majority of}} <b>stream</b> <b>types</b> are: proportion of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera; proportion of Plecoptera (mainly suited for mountain streams); number of Plecoptera taxa; proportion of xenosaprobic taxa; proportion of epirhithral preferring taxa.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Various {{definitions}} of stream channel stability are presented including "the natural stable channel", the graded river, dynamic equilibrium, and regime channels, and a quantitative assessment methodology is presented that distinguishes between stability states. The assessment procedure involves a stream channel stability prediction and validation methodology on a hierarchical framework. The stream channel stability method develops fieldmeasured variables to assess: 1) Stream state or channel condition variables, 2) Vertical stability (degradation/aggradation), 3) Lateral stability, 4) Channel patterns, 5) Stream profile and bed features, 6) Channel dimension factor, 7) Channel scour/deposition (with competence calculations of field verified critical dimensionless shear stress {{and change in}} bed and bar material size distribution), 8) Stability ratings (modified Pfankuch method) adjusted by <b>stream</b> <b>type,</b> 9) Dimensionless ratio sediment rating curves by <b>stream</b> <b>type</b> and stability ratings, and 10) Selection of position in <b>stream</b> <b>type</b> evolutionary scenario as quantified by morphological variables by <b>stream</b> <b>type</b> to determine state and potential of stream reach. The stability assessment is conducted on reference reach (stable) reaches and a departure analysis is performed when compared to an unstable reach of the same <b>stream</b> <b>type.</b> The assessment procedure utilizes various hierarchical levels for prediction and subsequent validation. Changes in the variables controlling river channel form, primarily streamflow, sediment regime, riparian vegetation, and direct physical modifications can cause stream channel instability. Separating the difference between anthropogenic versus geologic processes in channel adjustment {{is a key to}} prevention/mitigation/restoration of disturbed systems The adverse consequence of stream channel instability (dis-equilibrium) is associated with increased sediment supply, land productivity change, land loss, fish habitat deterioration, changes in both short and long-term channel evolution and loss of physical and biological function...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} rapid bioassessment {{project for}} the state of Georgia, {{relatively}} unimpaired reference streams and impaired sites were sampled for biological, chemical and physical parameters, and macroinvertebrates were identified. The metrics, biological, physical and chemical metrics, were selected using Ecological Data Application System Version 3. 3. 2 k (EDAS). Discrimination efficiency and correlations were performed to determine the best metrics that separated impaired streams from reference streams and later on to form the index of stream water quality. Principal components analysis of the selected metrics showed that some of the blackwater reference streams and clearwater reference streams are randomly placed over the ordination space {{and a few of the}} black water reference streams and a few of the clear water reference streams formed distinct clusters. As a result, the black water and clear water streams were analyzed as two different <b>stream</b> <b>types.</b> In Southern coastal plain ecoregion the compositional metrics are the dominant forms of metrics in streams. When the blackwater streams and clearwater streams were analyzed as two different <b>stream</b> <b>types,</b> different macroinvertebrate metrics characterized blackwater and clearwater streams within the two ecoregions. The metrics that formed the indices were more efficient in discriminating impaired and reference streams when separated into the two <b>stream</b> <b>types.</b> Index values were higher; demonstrating the better performance of the metrics.

Our study showed that not all criteria for reference conditions could be met for all <b>stream</b> <b>types.</b> This implies that `true' reference sites could not be selected for all <b>stream</b> <b>types</b> within the AQEM project. In our study, the differences between ecoregions, countries, and <b>stream</b> <b>types</b> were interpreted in terms of human impact. Validation of reference conditions showed differences between classification of sites as reference sites based on criteria to be used in the field and directly interpreting environmental or biological data and the result of the final assessment system. In some countries it was not possible to select reference conditions, because most of the a priori criteria were met. For example, reference conditions for Dutch <b>stream</b> <b>types</b> were established using historical data and predictions based on data from other geographical regions. Using data from adjacent countries appeared to be a feasible method for establishing reference conditions. Reference sites taken from other geographical areas represented a higher ecological quality than the Dutch sites of good ecological quality. However, metric results showed a large overlap between good and high ecological status. Historical information, on the other hand, was not found to be useful in metric calculations because of the confounding differences in sampling methods. One strong advantage of using historical information is that rare species that are locally extinct but still occur in the same <b>stream</b> <b>type</b> in other geographical areas can be added to the expected reference conditions.
