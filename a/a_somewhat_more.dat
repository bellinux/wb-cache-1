Being virtually identical to the F-84B, the C model suffered {{from all of the}} same defects and underwent a similar structural upgrade program in 1949. All F-84Cs were withdrawn from active service by 1952.|$|E
5|$|For the 1733 version, Bach used <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> <b>more</b> {{extended}} orchestra: the recorders {{are replaced}} by traversos (Fl) and they get separate parts in all four choral movements. In movements three and four the oboes {{are replaced by}} oboes d'amore (Oa). In the 10th movement (Suscepit Israel) the oboes replace the trumpet for the obbligato instrumental part.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid is a {{completely}} synthetic drug: it does not occur in nature (unlike erythromycin and many other antibiotics) and was not developed by building upon a naturally occurring skeleton (unlike most beta-lactams, which are semisynthetic). Many approaches are available for oxazolidinone synthesis, and several routes for the synthesis of linezolid {{have been reported in}} the chemistry literature. Despite good yields, the original method (developed by Upjohn for pilot plant-scale production of linezolid and eperezolid) is lengthy, requires the use of expensive chemicals—such as palladium on carbon and the highly sensitive reagents methanesulfonyl chloride and n-butyllithium—and needs low-temperature conditions. Much of the high cost of linezolid has been attributed to the expense of its synthesis. <b>A</b> <b>somewhat</b> <b>more</b> concise and cost-effective route better suited to large-scale production was patented by Upjohn in 1998.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, Pima County, home to Tucson, {{and most}} of {{southern}} Arizona have historically voted more Democratic. While Tucson's suburbs lean Republican, they hold to <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> <b>more</b> moderate brand of Republicanism than is common in the Phoenix area.|$|E
25|$|He ran {{again in}} the newly redrawn 6th congressional {{district}} and won the Republican primary with 42% of the vote. Byron was upset by <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> <b>more</b> liberal Democrat, State Delegate Thomas Hattery, in the Democratic primary. Many conservative Democrats switched their support to Bartlett in November, as he defeated Hattery 54%–46%.|$|E
25|$|Being inland and yet {{relatively}} {{close to}} continental Europe, Gravesend enjoys <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> <b>more</b> continental climate than the coastal areas of Kent, Essex and East Anglia and also compared to western parts of Britain. It is therefore less cloudy, drier, and {{less prone to}} Atlantic depressions with their associated wind and rain than western parts, {{as well as being}} hotter in summer and colder in winter.|$|E
50|$|The {{trail is}} {{somewhat}} unusual, {{in that part}} of the way, it is located on the wide traffic island that divides the road in two, instead of being located beside the road. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> consequence, <b>somewhat</b> <b>more</b> care has to be taken when crossing at the intersections.|$|R

5000|$|A {{documentary}} about Knudsen {{and his life}} premiered at Norwegian cinemas in March 2014 titled [...] "En prest og en plage", which portrayed the aging Knudsen in a close-up personal and <b>somewhat</b> <b>more</b> sympathetic light. Considered <b>a</b> generally <b>somewhat</b> <b>more</b> respected figure among the Norwegian anti-abortionists, some long-time critics of Knudsen voiced their respect for his dedication and for his hymn poetry after his death.|$|R
25|$|Like the Krishna tales, the {{two books}} of the late Kukulkan {{sequence}} focus on the adventures of Terrans on a relatively primitive alien world, in this instance <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> <b>more</b> advanced planet ruled by a species of dinosaur-like creatures superficially similar to the Osirians. Earth has colonies on Kukulkan, leading to inevitable friction with the native inhabitants, and the protagonists must deal with threats from both cultures.|$|E
25|$|The Beaux-Arts style heavily {{influenced}} {{the architecture of}} the United States in the period from 1880 to 1920. In contrast, many European architects of the period 1860–1914 outside France gravitated away from Beaux-Arts and towards their own national academic centers. Owing to the cultural politics of the late 19th century, British architects of Imperial classicism followed <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> <b>more</b> independent course, a development culminating in Sir Edwin Lutyens's New Delhi government buildings.|$|E
25|$|Lodger is {{the thirteenth}} studio album by English singer-songwriter David Bowie. It was {{originally}} released in May, 1979 by RCA Records. The {{last of the}} Berlin Trilogy, it was recorded in Switzerland and New York City with collaborator Brian Eno and producer Tony Visconti. Unlike Bowie's previous two albums, Lodger contained no instrumentals and <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> <b>more</b> pop-oriented style while experimenting with elements of world music and recording techniques inspired by Eno's Oblique Strategies cards.|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} comments {{illustrate the}} phonological development within {{the period of}} Koine. The phonetic transcriptions are tentative, and are intended to illustrate two different stages in the reconstructed development, an early conservative variety still relatively close to Classical Attic, and <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> later, <b>more</b> progressive variety approaching Modern Greek in some respects.|$|R
25|$|Kasha's rule {{dictates}} that the quantum yield of luminescence {{is independent of}} the wavelength of exciting radiation. This occurs because excited molecules usually decay to the lowest vibrational level of the excited state before fluorescence emission takes place. The Kasha–Vavilov rule does not always apply and is violated severely in many simple molecules. <b>A</b> <b>somewhat</b> <b>more</b> reliable statement, although still with exceptions, {{would be that the}} fluorescence spectrum shows very little dependence on the wavelength of exciting radiation.|$|E
25|$|Romániço (1991) is {{designed}} to be more intuitive for native speakers of English. It replaces vocabulary and some grammar with Romance constructions, allows <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> <b>more</b> irregular orthography, and eliminates some criticized points such as case, adjectival agreement, verbal inflection for tense and mood, and inherent gender, but retains the o, a, e suffixes for parts of speech and an agglutinative morphology. It is intended as a compromise between Esperanto and naturalistic conlangs such as Interlingua.|$|E
25|$|The January 7 {{debate on}} Nova TV {{was held at}} 21:45, moderated once again by Mislav Bago. The two {{candidates}} had <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> <b>more</b> intense exchange regarding most issues previously discussed in the campaign. They once again compared tenure in the League of Communists of Croatia and SDP, their personal properties as well as moral values. Josipović called on Bandić to compare their physical and stock properties in court, which the latter refused. There was some talk of endorsements, and some reflections on talking points. They finished in a more cordial tone with the mention of future private visits as well as family pets.|$|E

25|$|In 1996, a {{pilot was}} {{produced}} (see below) {{for a new}} revival of the show as MG2/Match Game 2, just {{five years after the}} previous incarnation had left the air. While that version (which did not air) had a much greater departure from the game's original format, the producers significantly retooled the format to create <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> <b>more</b> faithful remake of the program, which was picked up in syndication and began in fall 1998. It is the only version of the show to not air on a broadcast network (as the 1979–82 version and Match Game PM were essentially continuations of the CBS version).|$|E
25|$|Late in the war, as {{they got}} desperate, and as it became obvious to the Algarvians that non-Kaunians were now far more of a worry than the {{thoroughly}} cowed blonds, the Algarvians began to display <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> <b>more</b> pragmatic, open attitude toward the Kaunians. They allowed Valmierans and Jelgavans to join their army, and they {{played an important role}} on the southern front against the Unkerlanters and in Jelgava. Their mages still defaulted toward wanting to kill Kaunians out of habit, including the soldiers fighting on their side, but Algarvian officers increasingly refused to allow this, leading the mages to turn to killing Yaninan deserters or turning to other magics.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>somewhat</b> <b>more</b> {{complicated}} case {{is presented}} by the anonymous play sometimes known as The First Part of Richard II. This play, which exists in one incomplete manuscript copy (at the British Museum) is subtitled Thomas of Woodstock, and it is by this name that scholars since F. S. Boas have usually called it. This play treats the {{events leading up to}} the start of Shakespeare's play (though the two texts do not have identical characters). This closeness, along with the anonymity of the manuscript, has led certain scholars to attribute {{all or part of the}} play to Shakespeare, though many critics view this play as a secondary influence on Shakespeare, not as his work.|$|E
