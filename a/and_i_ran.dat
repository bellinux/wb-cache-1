25|$|In January 1985, {{nine months}} before his death, the tour reached New York for a {{farewell}} Broadway run. Aware he was dying, he gave an interview on Good Morning America discussing the dangers of smoking and expressing his desire to make an anti-smoking commercial. The Broadway production of The King <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> from January 7 to June 30 of that year, with Mary Beth Peil as Anna. His last performance marked the 4625th time he had {{played the role of}} the King. Meanwhile, Brynner and the American Cancer Society created a public service announcement using a clip from the Good Morning America interview.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with a}} German boy who Leto had {{previously}} met in Berlin. He spoke {{about the loss of}} his father and how he had played a Thirty Seconds to Mars song at the funeral. After Leto again met the German fan again at a concert in Austria, he asked him to share his story on camera. Leto explained, [...] "At the show in Austria, where there were tens of thousands of people, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> into him and interviewed him; he was the first interview of the summer, and he shared this story about losing his father, and what it taught him, it was really an organic and serendipitous and beautiful way to begin. He shared a really personal part of himself and we're really grateful to him, and that continued throughout all the interviews." ...|$|E
500|$|At age 10, Ryder and {{her family}} moved on again, this time to Petaluma, California. During her first week at Kenilworth Junior High, she was bullied {{by a group of}} her peers who mistook her for an effeminate, scrawny boy. [...] "I was wearing an old Salvation Army shop boy’s suit. As I went to the {{bathroom}} I heard people saying, ‘Hey, faggot’. They slammed my head into a locker. I fell to the ground and they started to kick the shit out of me. I had to have stitches. The school kicked me out, not the bullies... Years later, I went to a coffee shop <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> into one of the girls who’d kicked me, and she said, ‘Winona, Winona, can I have your autograph?’ And I said, ‘Do you remember me? Remember in seventh grade you beat up that kid?’ And she said, ‘Kind of’. And I said, ‘That was me. Go fuck yourself.’" [...] As a result, Ryder ended up being home-schooled that year.|$|E

500|$|After {{five years}} of {{substance}} abuse, arrests, rehab, and relapse, Downey was finally ready to work toward a full recovery from drugs {{and a return to}} his career. In discussing his failed attempts to control his own addictive behavior in the past, Downey told Oprah Winfrey in November 2004 that [...] "when someone says, 'I really wonder if maybe I should go to rehab?' Well, uh, you're a wreck, you just lost your job, and your wife left you. Uh, you might want to give it a shot." [...] He added that after his last arrest in April 2001, when he knew he would likely be facing another stint in prison or another form of incarceration such as court-ordered rehab, [...] "I said, 'You know what? I don't think I can continue doing this.' And I reached out for help, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> with it. You can reach out for help in kind of a half-assed way and you'll get it and you won't take advantage of it. It's not that difficult to overcome these seemingly ghastly problems...what's hard is to decide to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 26, 2002, {{only a week}} or {{two before}} signing a record {{contract}} with Universal South Records, West had an injury to his left arm which threatened his musical career and guitar playing. He says, [...] "I locked myself out of my house. But I'd done that before, and I had a way of breaking in through a window. But this time, I had a really hard time getting the window open. I started pushing up on the window really hard and my hand broke through the glass. Blood starting spewing out of my left arm everywhere <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> down my street screaming for help. After seeing so much blood, I went into shock and just blacked {{out in the middle of}} the street. The next thing I can remember is some construction workers praying over me in Spanish and then being taken to the hospital." [...] West was told that the chances were low of regaining the full use of his left arm, having come very close to severing a major artery. He recovered after the accident, however, and was able to continue playing guitar and record for his first studio album.|$|E
2500|$|Aboard the Ollie K. Wilds, {{the crew}} {{in the pilot}} house {{did not see the}} collision. As they were {{preparing}} to offload vehicles, an engineer burst through the door, saying a passenger saw a ship run over the ferry. The captain of the ferry immediately ordered his vessel to cast off, having offloaded just one of his 15 vehicle load. He contacted the pilot of the Frosta, and asked him if the ferry had sunk. [...] "He went in front of me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> him over," [...] was the pilot's reply.|$|E
60|$|I do {{not know}} why the sight of myself should alarm me so, but I rush from the house in terror, and the faces follow me; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> faster <b>and</b> faster, but <b>I</b> know that I shall never leave them behind me.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Stobell {{brought up}} {{in front of him and}} frowned thoughtfully. [...] "I suppose you’re right," [...] he said, slowly; [...] "but if we ever get off this chicken-perch, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> across him, let him look out, that’s all." ...|$|R
60|$|I struck New York about noon one day, {{and took}} a walk up Broadway. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> against Silver himself, all {{encompassed}} up in a spacious kind of haberdashery, leaning against a hotel and rubbing the half-moons on his nails with a silk handkerchief.|$|R
2500|$|The {{band was}} formed in 2008 by Matthew Tybor, also {{referred}} to as [...] "The Bunny" [...] hence the rabbit mask and persona he incorporates in the group. Tybor was quickly joined by Chris Hutka, known as [...] "The Bear" [...] who likewise, wears a bear mask. In an interview, when asked about the meaning behind the band name and the masks, Tybor stated that [...] "I'm a little weird and a little off, but it was nothing in-depth or a serious meaning behind it. It was more of a random, incoherent thought <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> with it". The Bunny (Tybor) employs screamed vocals for the band while The Bear provides clean vocals. The band's first five albums featured Chris Hutka as The Bear. Their sixth album A Liar Wrote This features Hutka's then-replacement, Haley Roback, and their seventh album The Way We Rust features Joseph Garcia, who had toured with the band in the past.|$|E
2500|$|He {{made his}} full {{international}} debut for England on 19 May 1951 against Portugal at Goodison Park, Liverpool, {{and made an}} immediate impression by scoring with his first touch of the ball after only 19 seconds. This proved to be his only international appearance due to injuries, the dominance of Billy Wright, and his habit of putting his club before his country. Nicholson {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "My duty is to get fit for Tottenham. Well, they pay my wages, don't they?". Of his only appearance he said [...] "Stan Pearson nodded it back <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> on to let go a first time shot which, from the moment I hit it, I knew was going in. But for the next game they brought back Billy Wright and I accepted that because he was the better player". Nicholson is the only player to have scored for England with his first touch in international football and subsequently never play at that level again.|$|E
2500|$|The {{children}} were {{asleep in the}} berths, and I was lying awake, listening to the sounds on the boat and wondering which part of the Sound we were on. [...] Suddenly there came a signal shrill whistle from our boat, and I jumped up and looked out of the window. [...] There was a big boat, bearing directly down on us. [...] She blew four times and began to back. [...] But still she came ahead towards us, and I {{could see she was}} going to cut into us. [...] I don't know what I thought or did. [...] I watched her coming on, and it seemed as if she went slowly, but still so fast. [...] Then she ground into us, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> to my baby. [...] The boat broke in all the side of the room, and the sound of smashing timbers and glass with the shock of the impact almost made me sick. [...] To add to the confusion, there were the shouts of the officers and the crew. [...] The cries of my little boys and girl. [...] The {{children were}} bruised by the collision, and none of us were able to save any clothing or any other personal belongings.|$|E

5000|$|A CD soundtrack was {{included}} for customers who pre-ordered the game. The soundtrack from Dog Ear Records was also made {{available on the}} iTunes store. The theme song, Kimito Hashiru Tobokuha Naku (lit.

6000|$|She {{laughed at}} the compliment. [...] "Come right in, sir," [...] she said. [...] "I'm Miss Ettie Shafter, Mr. Shafter's daughter.

So you can fix things with him right away." ...|$|R
2500|$|Ryun {{participated in}} the 1964, 1968, and 1972 Summer Olympics. At age 17 years, 137 days in 1964, he remains the {{youngest}} American male track athlete to ever qualify for the Olympics. In 1968, he won the silver medal in the 1,500 meters in Mexico City, losing to Kip Keino from Kenya, whose remarkable race remained the Olympic 1,500-meter record for 16 years. Before the race, Ryun had thought that a time of 3:39 would {{be good enough to}} win in the high altitude of Mexico City. He ended up running faster than that with a 3:37.8, but Keino's 3:34.9 was too tough to beat at that altitude. Keino moved into the first position with two laps to go (800 meters) at world record pace. Ryun continued to move up during the last two laps from eighth to second but was never closer than about 30 yards from Keino. Years later, in 1981, he told Tex Maule in an interview for The Runner magazine, [...] "We had thought that 3:39 would win <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> under that. I considered it like winning a gold medal; I had done my very best and I still believe I would have won at sea level." [...] Ryun was attacked by some writers who believed he had let his nation down. [...] "Some even said I had let down the whole world. I didn't get any credit for running my best and no one seemed to realize that Keino had performed brilliantly." [...] In the 1972 Munich, Germany, Games, he was tripped and fell down during a 1,500-meter qualifying heat. Although the International Olympic Committee (IOC) acknowledged that a foul had occurred, U.S. appeals to have Ryun reinstated in the competition were denied by the IOC.|$|E
60|$|Heavens, how I ran! The wind buffeted my {{face and}} buzzed in my nostrils. The rain pringled upon my skin and hissed past my ears. I {{stumbled}} into holes. I tripped over bushes. I fell among brambles. I was torn and breathless and bleeding. My tongue was like leather, my feet like lead, and my heart beating like a kettle-drum. Still I ran, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> to {{the door}} {{in time to see}} Jim Hawkins, safe and sound, come {{climbing}} over the stockade.|$|E
6000|$|... "A-w-w," [...] the man sighed, {{his face}} {{clearing}} and infinite comprehension sounding in his voice. [...] "I have no moccasins. I t'ink pretty damn cold." [...] His satisfied expression changed to naive surprise when an outburst of laughter greeted his statement, {{but he went}} on stolidly. [...] "One more shot <b>I</b> hear, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> down the trail." ...|$|R
