5000|$|The dual number {{existed in}} Proto-Indo-European. It persisted {{in many of}} the ancient Indo-European {{languages}} that descended from it such as Ancient Greek, and Sanskrit, which still uses dual forms across nouns, verbs, and adjectives, and Gothic, which used dual forms in pronouns and verbs. It can still be found in a few modern Indo-European languages such as Scottish Gaelic, Slovenian, and Sorbian. Many more modern Indo-European languages show residual traces of the dual whose function has since been replaced by simple plural, as in the English distinctions both vs. all, either vs. <b>any,</b> <b>neither</b> vs. none, and so on. A commonly used sentence to exemplify dual in English is [...] "Both go to the same school." [...] where both refers to two people who had already been determined in the conversation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{distinction}} between a [...] "singular" [...] number (one) and a [...] "plural" [...] number (more than one) found in English {{is not the only}} possible classification. Another one is [...] "singular" [...] (one), [...] "dual" [...] (two) and [...] "plural" [...] (more than two). Dual number existed in Proto-Indo-European, persisted in many ancient Indo-European languages that descended from it—Sanskrit, Ancient Greek, Gothic, Old Norse, and Old English for example—and can still be found in a few modern Indo-European languages such as Slovene. Many more modern Indo-European languages show residual traces of the dual, as in the English distinctions both vs. all, either vs. <b>any,</b> <b>neither</b> vs. none, and so on. (Note, however, that Norwegian både, for example, though cognate with English both, can be used with more than two things, as in X sparer både tid, penger, og arbeid, literally [...] "X saves both time, money, and labour".) ...|$|E
5000|$|For example, Epiphanius of Salamis, a Jew by birth, born in Phoenicia, {{converted}} to Christianity in adulthood and lived as a monk for over 20 years in Palestine from 335-340 to 362, writes in [...] "Panarion" [...] in [...] "Contra antidicomarianst" [...] {{about the death}} of the Virgin Mary following: [...] "If any think I [...] am mistaken, moreover, let them search through the scriptures <b>any</b> <b>neither</b> find Mary’s death, nor whether or not she died, nor whether or not she was buried — even though John surely traveled throughout Asia. And yet, nowhere does he say that he took the holy Virgin with him. Scripture simply kept silence because of the overwhelming wonder, not to throw men’s minds into consternation. For I dare not say — though I have my suspicions, I keep silent. Perhaps, just as her death is not to be found, so I may have found some traces of the holy and blessed Virgin.""The holy virgin may have died and been buried — her falling asleep was with honor, her death in purity, her crown in virginity. Or she may have been put to death — as the scripture says, “And a sword shall pierce through her soul” —her fame is among the martyrs and her holy body, by which light rose on the world, rests amid blessings. Or she may have remained alive, for God is not incapable of doing whatever he wills. No one knows her end. But we must not honor the saints to excess; we must honor their Master. It is time for the error of those who have gone astray to cease." [...] Christians in the late 4th century had different opinions regarding Mary's death; some believed that she was martyred. For this reason, Ambrose, for example, wrote: [...] "Neither the letter of Scripture nor Tradition does not teach us that Mary had left this life as a consequence of suffering from bodily ulcers." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to show and {{consider}} the several aspects of women and work in modern Japan, observing the case of Yayoi Yoshioka as the example of the exceptional educational leader who mainly dealt with and devoted herself to the development of women‘s work and social contribution in the period of pre-war and wartime Japan. She was a professional woman, a medical doctor herself, the founder and educator of the female medical education, and the very influential leader of various types of social education groups for women. In the development of female education in the latter part of Meiji Era (1868 - 1900), the image of ‗Being a good wife and wise mother ‘ was stressed very much as the finest ideal, and also was regarded as almost the only educational goal for girls (Ryo-sai-ken-bo). There, basically, women were expected not to work outside their domestic sphere, having <b>any</b> <b>neither</b> occupations nor professions. And the most important of all was that Ryo-sai-ken-bo was set as the educational goal of the most female secondary schools Jogakko. Yoshioka is located at the very unique status in the history of female education as such in four reasons. First, she was a pioneer in the professional education for women in modern Japan. Secondly, she also took the strong leadership in Shojo-kai, later Joshi-Seinendan, both of whic...|$|E
40|$|PosterTooth {{supported}} complete overdentures {{have been}} a treatment option for decades and they provide the patient with proprioception (the awareness of jaw-space relationships) which is normally lost when teeth are extracted. In addition, the overdenture provides the patient with improved biting force and neuromuscular control. The objective of this case presentation is to discuss a technique used to fabricate complete tooth supported overdenture. Assessments: 80 year old African American female presented to Graduate Prosthodontic Clinic at IUPUI complaining of difficulty in chewing food due to her partially edentulous mandible. Her medical history revealed a history of hypothyroidism, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and hypertension. In 2013 root canal treatments were done to # 22, 27 with post space preparations. Intraoral examination revealed a resorbed mandibular residual ridge. The prosthodontic treatment plan was to retain these two teeth and attach LocatorsÂ® to them to improve the retention of the denture. Impression was made of both post spaces and posts were waxed up on the master cast. Castto-Locator® attachments were incorporated in the wax ups, which were invested and cast in Type III Gold Alloy. The final posts with Cast-to-LocatorÂ® attachments were cemented with resin cement. Finally, the mandibular complete overdenture was adjusted and delivered to the patient. Evaluation: the LocatorÂ® attachments were stable in the gold posts without <b>any</b> <b>neither</b> periapical pathology nor gingival inflammation. In addition, the patient was able to properly clean the remaining root and the internal surface of the denture. In conclusion: This technique resulted in a very satisfying and retentive denture for the patient while utilizing minimum invasive procedures...|$|E

And the most important of all was that Ryo-sai-ken-bo was set as the educational goal of the most female secondary schools Jogakko. Yoshioka is located at the very unique status in the history of female education as such in four reasons. First, she was a pioneer in the professional education for women in modern Japan. Secondly, she also took the strong leadership in Shojo-kai, later Joshi-Seinendan, both of which were nation-wide regional non-formal groups for the female youth. Thirdly, Yoshioka was appointed to the only female member of the Advisory Committee of Education (established in 1937), which was to discuss the policy and strategies of educational reform under the remodeled structure of the all-out war. And fourthly, she took part in many kinds of organizations and voluntary groups, as a leader or equivalent status. For Yoshioka, all of these were pursued in order to establish the social status and to get the social power of the female medical doctors. By looking at her wide range of achievements and very powerful remarks in various kinds of media, we can see another aspect of female education in modern Japan. On the defeat of the war in 1945, Yoshioka was banished both from the educational job status and from the official job status, being accused of leading the people to the invading war. But, at least, we can learn so many of the positive and negative lessons from her case, and start thinking about the relationship among these: women, work, education and social development...|$|E
