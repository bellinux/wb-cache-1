5|$|No {{recession}} of the post-World War II era has come <b>anywhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> {{depth of the}} Great Depression. In the Great Depression, GDP fell by 27% (the deepest after demobilization is the recession beginning in December 2007, during which GDP has fallen 5.1% as of {{the second quarter of}} 2009) and unemployment rate reached 10% (the highest since was the 10.8% rate reached during the 1981–82 recession).|$|E

During interview six, he said he had hit Blakelock with an iron bar in the chest and leg. Rose writes that there were no such injuries on Blakelock's body. In a seventh interview, he said he had hit a police officer, but that it was not Blakelock. On the basis of this confession evidence, he was charged with murder.|$|E
5|$|When Adams {{resigned}} as manager in October 2004, Craig Levein was appointed boss. This {{would prove to}} be an unsuccessful period and after 15 months in charge, Levein was sacked, having failed to get the Foxes <b>anywhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> promotion places. Assistant manager Rob Kelly took over as caretaker manager, and after winning three out of four matches, was appointed to see {{out the rest of the}} season. Kelly steered Leicester to safety and in April 2006 was given the manager's job on a permanent basis.|$|E

5|$|According to the classicist J. C. Stobart, Tiberius's Greek {{education}} had {{caused him to}} overestimate {{the reliability of the}} people as a powerbase, causing him to overplay his hand. In Rome, even when led by a bold Tribune the people lacked <b>anywhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> influence they enjoyed {{at the height of the}} Athenian polis. Another problem for Gaius's aims was that the Roman constitution, specifically the Tribal Assembly, was designed to prevent any one individual governing for a sustained period of time – and there were several other checks and balances to prevent power being concentrated on any one person. Stobart adds that another reason for the efforts' failures was the Gracchi's idealism; they were deaf to the baser notes of human nature and failed to recognize how corrupt and selfish all sections of Roman society had become.|$|E
5|$|Glacier is {{considered}} to have excellent air and water quality. No major areas of dense human population exist <b>anywhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> region and industrial effects are minimized due to a scarcity of factories and other potential contributors of pollutants. However, the sterile and cold lakes found throughout the park are easily contaminated by airborne pollutants that fall whenever it rains or snows, and some evidence of these pollutants {{has been found in}} park waters. Wildfires could also impact the quality of water. However, the pollution level is currently viewed as negligible, and the park lakes and waterways have a water quality rating of A-1, the highest rating given by the state of Montana.|$|E
5|$|Major modern {{economic}} statistics, such as {{unemployment and}} GDP, were not compiled {{on a regular}} and standardized basis until after World War II. The average duration of the 11 recessions between 1945 and 2001 is 10 months, compared to 18 months for recessions between 1919 and 1945, and 22 months for recessions from 1854 to 1919. Because of the great changes in the economy over the centuries, {{it is difficult to}} compare the severity of modern recessions to early recessions. No recession of the post-World War II era has come <b>anywhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> depth of the Great Depression, which lasted from 1929 until 1941 and was caused by the 1929 crash of the stock market and other factors.|$|E

5|$|The Gulf of Aqaba {{lies between}} the Sinai Peninsula and the Arabian Peninsula, both mostly desert regions {{with very few}} {{permanent}} settlements. The seismologists who work with historical events gather macroseismic data from written records from cities {{that may not have}} been <b>anywhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> epicentral area. This can result in the mislocation of events when significant damage was reported in a particular location which were not actually where the earthquake occurred. The records of these events have been influenced by the distribution of the population (where the people were) and this has caused difficulty in creating a complete and accurate index of historical events. Several studies in the 80s and 90s indicate that there were two or possibly three large earthquakes in the region in the last 2000 years with magnitudes estimated to be 6.5–7.0 based on macroseismic data.|$|E
5|$|Warner Bros. {{devoted a}} large amount of secrecy for Batman Returns. The art {{department}} was required to keep their office blinds pulled down. Cast and crew had to have photo ID badges with the movie's fake working title Dictel to go <b>anywhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> sets. Kevin Costner was refused a chance to visit the set. An entertainment magazine leaked the first photos of Danny DeVito as the Penguin; in response Warner Bros. employed a private investigator to track down the accomplice. $65 million was spent during the production of Batman Returns, while $15 million was used for marketing, coming to a total cost of $80 million. The final shot of Catwoman looking at the Bat-Signal was completed during post-production and {{was not part of the}} shooting script. After Batman Returns was completed Warner Bros. felt it was best for Catwoman to survive, saving more characterizations in a future installment. Pfeiffer was unavailable and a body double was chosen.|$|E
5|$|On June 25, 2010, {{during the}} 2010 NHL Entry Draft, Ballard {{was traded to}} the Vancouver Canucks along with Victor Oreskovich, for Michael Grabner, Steve Bernier, and Vancouver's first round pick, the 25th overall selection, used to select Quinton Howden. After {{spending}} two months of the off-season on crutches while recovering from surgery, he reported to the Canucks' training camp, but struggled in the pre-season. Four games into the regular season, he suffered a concussion after being hit into the boards by Los Angeles Kings forward Brad Richardson on October 16, 2010. He was subsequently sidelined for five games. Upon returning to the lineup, however, his play continued to struggle. Averaging 13 minutes of ice time a game, he was eventually taken out of the lineup for four games in November by Canucks head coach Alain Vigneault. It marked {{the first time in his}} career he was a healthy scratch. After being re-insterted into the lineup, he scored his first goal as a Canuck in a 6–1 win against the San Jose Sharks on November 26. Several months later, Ballard suffered a sprained medial collateral ligament (MCL) in his right knee during a game against the Ottawa Senators on February 7, 2011. The injury resulted from opposing forward Milan Michalek tripping him from behind, which Canucks general manager Mike Gillis pointed out did not occur <b>anywhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> puck, alluding to the play as illegal and disrespectable. Ballard finished his first regular season with career lows in games played (65), goals (2), assists (5), points (7) and average ice time per game (15 minutes and 14 seconds). His individual struggles came amidst a franchise record season for the Canucks, who won the Presidents' Trophy as the NHL's regular season champion for the first time in team history. Entering the playoffs as the first seed in the West, the Canucks advanced past the Chicago Blackhawks, Nashville Predators and San Jose Sharks to qualify for the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals. Facing the Boston Bruins, Vancouver lost the Stanley Cup in Game 7. Over the team's 25 playoff games, Ballard dressed for 10. Playing only one game of the final two rounds, he dropped in the depth chart behind Aaron Rome and rookie Chris Tanev.|$|E

25|$|However, this {{analysis}} showed that the clays did not originate <b>anywhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> site of Enkomi and that suitable clays {{are close to the}} sites of Kalavasos and Alassa (itself a possible cognate of Alashiya). These sites, especially Kalavasos, were also important Late Bronze Age sites and are located close to sources of copper.|$|E
25|$|To test Lee's {{story and}} rule out any {{prospect}} {{that he was}} merely a well-informed fantasist, officers deliberately {{took him to a}} dwelling where a high-profile fire had occurred but a criminal conviction had already been secured. Lee immediately ruled out his involvement— he said he had never been <b>anywhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> area— leading police to believe that he was being truthful about the number of fires he had started.|$|E

25|$|In Great Britain, MMA {{failed to}} {{capitalise}} on this momentum {{and has not}} seen <b>anywhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> popularity levels MMA has received in USA. It is hard to pinpoint the main reason why exactly this has happened. The failure of MMA promoters to secure a substantial and locked TV deal until late last year. The reluctance of broadcasting powerhouses BBC and Sky Sports to fully support the sport? The stereotype of extreme violence {{that they have been}} unable to shake off? All of these are valid reasons why MMA failed to capture the public’s imagination.|$|E
25|$|The tips of {{the right}} and left maxillary stylets are not the same; the right is hook-like and curved, and the left is straight.

The stylets are retained in a groove in the labium, and during feeding, they are freed from the groove as the jointed labium is bent or folded out of the way; its tip never enters the wound.|$|E

25|$|But on July 11, 1966, CBS preempted Password {{in favor}} of CBS News' live {{coverage}} of a press conference held by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara {{on the progress of}} the Vietnam War.

A new show beginning that day on ABC—The Newlywed Game—caused some frustrated Password fans to begin defecting immediately; NBC also benefited from the CBS programming decision, experiencing success with their recently launched soap opera Days of Our Lives.|$|E

They reiterated that they had discovered skulls, bones and other body parts, and said they were unable to give a figure for the number of victims. The victims' identities and number could only be established with DNA tests. The police then sealed the house and did not allow news media <b>anywhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> site.|$|E
25|$|Although Ogg hadn't reached <b>anywhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> {{ubiquity of}} the MPEG {{standards}} (e.g., MP3/MP4), , it was {{commonly used to}} encode free content (such as free music, multimedia on Wikimedia Foundation projects and Creative Commons files) and had started to be supported by a significant minority of digital audio players. Also supporting the Ogg format were many popular video game engines, including Doom 3, Unreal Tournament 2004, , Jets n Guns, , , Stepmania, , Lineage 2, Vendetta Online, Battlefield 2, and the Grand Theft Auto engines, {{as well as the}} audio files of the Java-based game, Minecraft. The more popular Vorbis codec had built-in support on many software players, and extensions were available for nearly all the rest.|$|E
