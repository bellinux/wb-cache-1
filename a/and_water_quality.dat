5|$|For safety <b>and</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> reasons, {{the lake}} has {{different}} zones for different activities. The eastern extremity is zoned for primary contact water {{activities such as}} swimming and water skiing. The East and Central Basins, closer to populated areas, are zoned for secondary contact water sports such as sailing or rowing. West Lake and Tarcoola Reach, which covers the area between Commonwealth Avenue and Kurrajong Point, is the primary recreational area of the lake, and both primary and secondary contact water sports are permitted. Yarramundi Reach near Scrivener Dam has a marked rowing course, and is zoned as secondary, although primary contact activities are also allowed.|$|E
5|$|Glacier is {{considered}} to have excellent air <b>and</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality.</b> No major areas of dense human population exist anywhere near the region and industrial effects are minimized due to a scarcity of factories and other potential contributors of pollutants. However, the sterile and cold lakes found throughout the park are easily contaminated by airborne pollutants that fall whenever it rains or snows, and some evidence of these pollutants {{has been found in}} park waters. Wildfires could also impact the quality of water. However, the pollution level is currently viewed as negligible, and the park lakes and waterways have a water quality rating of A-1, the highest rating given by the state of Montana.|$|E
5|$|Studies on {{the ecology}} of the Chittenango ovate amber snail are fairly recent. It is an herbivorous species which lives in the fresh spray zone of the Chittenango Falls, in {{partially}} sunlit areas with lush herbaceous growth. Several parameters appear to be influential in its habitat selection, namely humidity, substrate, temperature, vegetation, <b>and</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality.</b> Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is a hermaphroditic species, and its mating season is from May through July. It lays egg clusters, each one containing an average of 8 to 14 eggs, at the base of plants, under matted vegetation, or in loose, wet soil. Maturity is reached in five to eight months, and its life span is roughly 2.5 years. Some of its predators include insects, amphibians, mammals, birds, and occasionally other snails.|$|E

5|$|The French {{started their}} {{evacuation}} with their pre-conceived notion that few {{would want to}} head south. As knowledge of the migration program spread through the communist-controlled north, thousands of predominantly northern Catholic asylum-seekers descended on the capital Hanoi and the port of Haiphong, {{both of which were}} still in French control. This led to anarchy and confusion as the emigrants fought over limited shelter, food, medicine and places on the ships and planes that were bound for the south. By early August, there were over 200,000evacuees waiting in Hanoi and Haiphong. Initially the ad hoc camps had insufficient sanitation <b>and</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> control, leading to the possibility of outbreaks of disease. Some American representatives said that they were the worst conditions they had seen. The conditions continued to be poor and chaotic after the evacuation got into full swing, and did not improve significantly for a month. There was no organization infrastructure as far as registration or medical records and immunisation of the waiting evacuees. The communists thus sent their propaganda activists through the camps and said that the lack of organisation proved that life for prospective refugees would be even worse in the south, where they would be completely under the control of South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The River Board Act of 1950 {{sought to}} replace the Catchment Boards with larger organisations, and from 1950 the East Sussex River Board took over the {{responsibilities}} {{of most of the}} catchments in East Sussex, but the Rother and Jury's Gut Catchment Board became part of the Kent River Board. Further changes followed the Water Resources Act 1963, and responsibility passed to the Kent and Sussex River Authorities in 1964. Ten years later, these structures were replaced by unitary authorities, who had responsibility for the supply of drinking water and for the drainage function of rivers. This lasted until the passing of the Water Act 1989, which split apart the two functions, and management of the river became the responsibility of the National Rivers Authority, Southern Region. Finally in April 1996, the National Rivers Authority was abolished with the formation of the Environment Agency. The agency has responsibility for drainage <b>and</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality,</b> {{and in the case of}} some rivers, it holds the navigation rights. The Rother is unusual, in that while it is under the jurisdiction of the Environment Agency, it is a free river, and so a licence is not required to use it. The Environment Agency also acts as the harbour authority for Rye Harbour, another unique situation, and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs acts as a signatory to the Harbour of Rye Bylaws.|$|E
