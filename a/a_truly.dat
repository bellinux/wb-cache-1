5|$|Czech {{national}} opera {{until this}} {{time had been}} represented only by minor, rarely performed works. This opera, Smetana's second, {{was part of his}} quest to create <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> Czech operatic genre. Smetana's musical treatment made considerable use of traditional Bohemian dance forms such as the polka and furiant, and although he largely avoided the direct quotation of folksong he neverthess created music considered by Czechs to be quintessentially Czech in spirit.|$|E

5|$|Commonsense {{knowledge}} and reasoning. Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply {{enormous amounts of}} information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, Jesse Thrash was the team's first All-Southern selection. He {{began the}} season as a sub and closed it as the undisputed star of the Tech team.

A professional coach was desperately needed if Tech wished to build <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> competitive football program.

5|$|Meanwhile, Edward {{had been}} living <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> extravagant lifestyle, {{including}} extensive gambling, resulting in his running up debts of some £40,000, which in 1683 forced him to sell many of his estates in Wiltshire. Over the next two years, Edward incurred further debts of around £38,000 (£5,270,000) and in 1686 was finally forced to sell his remaining lands in the south-west, including Farleigh Hungerford Castle, to Sir Henry Bayntun, who purchased them for £56,000 (£7,750,000). Bayntun lived in the castle for a few years, {{until his death in}} 1691.|$|E

She began it in several forms, which she successively rejected, after they were considerably advanced. She wrote {{many parts of the}} work again and again, and, when she had finished what she intended for the first part, she felt herself more urgently stimulated to revise and improve what she had written, than to proceed, with constancy of application, in the parts that were to follow.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Mk. IV in July 1940 {{improved}} matters, {{but it was the}} delivery of the Bristol Beaufighter starting in August that produced <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> effective system. The Beaufighter had considerably more powerful engines, speed that allowed it to catch its targets, and a powerful gun pack of four 20mm cannon that could easily destroy a bomber in a single pass. Squadron use began in October, and its first victory came soon after on 19/20 November when a Beaufighter IF of No. 604 Squadron destroyed a Ju 88A-5 near Chichester, very close to the first success of the Mk. III.|$|E
5|$|The new {{government}} {{was faced with}} a major challenge: the Chamber of Deputies was divided into three groups: the ultraconservatives, the Moderates and the Liberals. Paranhos and Caxias named men who were either ultraconservatives or Moderates to the remaining portfolios, in an attempt to weaken the reinvigorated Liberal opposition and consolidate a workable governing majority. Despite successfully recruiting enough supporters from outside the party to form a government, the Cabinet was hobbled from the outset by its lack of internal unity. It was doomed when Paranhos's friend and former colleague in the Conciliation Cabinet, José Tomás Nabuco de Araújo, delivered a speech advocating a merger of Moderate Conservatives and Liberals into <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> new political party.|$|E

5|$|As {{marine mammal}} species often play {{a large part}} in their ecosystems, it is {{possible}} that the sea mink was an important intertidal predator. It may have had a similar diet to the American mink, and may have consumed seabirds, seabird eggs, and hard-bodied marine invertebrates, though in greater proportions. Fur traders reported that sea mink dens had two entrances, and were made in the rocks piled up by the waves. Remains of toad sculpins and ocean pout were the most common around their dens, and garden banded snails were also reported to have been part of their diet. Their seafood-oriented diet may have increased their size. According to fur traders, the sea mink was nocturnal and resided in caves and rock crevices during the day. Due to the overlap of American mink and sea mink ranges, {{it is possible that}} they hybridized with each other. Although not <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> marine species, being confined to coastal waters, the sea mink was unusually aquatic compared to other members of Musteloidea, being, next to otters, the most aquatic member of the taxon.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to global}} demand and the {{development}} staff's desire to further Lightning's character, development began for a sequel to XIII. The game tackles {{the question of whether}} Lightning is happy after the events of XIII. Even before a sequel was greenlit, Toriyama had wanted to create <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> happy ending for the character. Lightning's outfit in XIII-2 was designed by Isamu Kamikokuryo. He worked from a rough sketch by Nomura of how Lightning should appear. The outfit was redone several times by Kamikokuryo: a qipao and a science fiction-inspired design were both discarded because they clashed with the game's atmosphere. The final design was inspired by the valkyries of Norse mythology. The outfit was meant to reflect the environment around Lightning. It features a feather motif to represent Lightning's light, delicate side and her growing powers. She was depicted as having transcended her human limits, making it difficult to depict her as a normal person.|$|E
5|$|During {{this same}} time, a {{constitutional}} convention {{was called to}} determine California's application for statehood into the United States. After statehood was granted, the capital city moved between three cities in the Bay Area: San Jose (1849–1851), Vallejo (1851–1852), and Benicia (1852–1853) before permanently settling in Sacramento in 1854. As the Gold Rush wound down, wealth generated from the endeavor led {{to the establishment of}} Wells Fargo Bank and the Bank of California, and immigrant laborers attracted by the promise of wealth transformed the demographic makeup of the region. Construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad from the Oakland Long Wharf attracted so many laborers from China that by 1870, eight percent of San Francisco's population was of Asian origin. The completion of the railroad connected the Bay Area {{with the rest of the}} United States, established <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> national marketplace for the trade of goods, and accelerated the urbanization of the region.|$|E

5|$|Fakih {{continued}} {{to work with the}} ministry and the Muhammadiyah, serving as the organisation's First Deputy Chair under Ahmad Rasyid Sutan Mansur. In 1956 he was one of three Muhammadiyah members who presented their concept of <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> Islamic society, one which emphasised social education. During this time he was more active with Masyumi, and after the 1955 Constituent Assembly election, Fakih was made a member of the Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia. This assembly, meant to reach an agreement for a new national constitution, failed to gain a consensus, and was disbanded by president Sukarno with his decree of 5 July 1959. That year Fakih collaborated with Hamka, Joesoef Poear Abdullah, and Ahmad Joesoef to launch the magazine Pandji Masjarakat. Sukarno later disbanded Masyumi on 17 August 1960 after leading Masyumi members, such as Mohammad Natsir and Sjafruddin Prawiranegara, were involved with the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia; Fakih had been involved in the negotiations with the Revolutionary Government, working with Mohammad Roem.|$|E
5|$|Finally in 1859, Marx {{published}} A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, {{his first}} serious economic work. This work was intended {{merely as a}} preview of his three-volume Das Kapital (English title: Capital: Critique of Political Economy), which he intended to publish at a later date. In A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, Marx accepts the labour theory of value as advocated by David Ricardo, but whereas Ricardo drew a distinction between use value and value in commodities, Ricardo always {{had been unable to}} define the real relationship between use value and value. The reasoning Marx laid out in his book clearly delineated the true relationship between use value and value. He also produced <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> scientific theory of money and money circulation in the capitalist economy, thus A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy created a storm of enthusiasm when it appeared in public and the entire edition of the book was sold out quickly.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the nature and}} {{limitations}} of the maritime technology of the age meant that the neither the Byzantines nor any of their opponents could develop a true thalassocracy. Galley fleets were confined to coastal operations, and {{were not able to}} play <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> independent role. Furthermore, as the alternation of Byzantine victories and defeats against the Arabs illustrates, no side was able to permanently gain the upper hand. Although the Byzantines pulled off a number of spectacular successes, such as Nasar's remarkable night-time victory in 880 (one of a handful of similar engagements in the Middle Ages), these victories were balanced off by similarly disastrous losses. Reports of mutinies by oarsmen in Byzantine fleets also reveal that conditions were often far from the ideal prescribed in the manuals. Combined with the traditional predominance of the great Anatolian land-holders in the higher military and civil offices, all this meant that, as in the Roman Empire, the navy, even at its height, was still regarded largely as an adjunct to the land forces. This fact is clearly illustrated by the relatively lowly positions its admirals held in the imperial hierarchy.|$|E
