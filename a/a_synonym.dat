5|$|Another sauropod of the Nemegt-Formation, Nemegtosaurus, {{is known}} {{only from a}} skull. Opisthocoelicaudia, on the other hand, lacks both the skull and neck, precluding a direct {{comparison}} and leading to suspicions that it may represent <b>a</b> <b>synonym</b> of Nemegtosaurus. According to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), the oldest name has priority over younger synonyms – if Opisthocoelicaudia would {{be shown to be}} <b>a</b> <b>synonym</b> of Nemegtosaurus, the name Nemegtosaurus would remain valid while Opisthocoelicaudia would become invalid.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} above, John Scannella {{had argued}} in 2010 that Nedoceratops {{should be considered}} <b>a</b> <b>synonym</b> of Triceratops. Andrew Farke (2011) maintained that it represents a valid distinct genus. Nick Longrich agreed with Scannella about Nedoceratops and made a further suggestion: that the recently described Ojoceratops was likewise <b>a</b> <b>synonym.</b> The fossils, he argued, are indistinguishable from the T. horridus specimens that were previously attributed to the defunct species T. serratus.|$|E

5|$|Akodon caenosus is a rodent in {{the genus}} Akodon found in northwestern Argentina and south-central Bolivia.

5|$|Apatosaurus excelsus was the {{original}} type species of Brontosaurus, first named by Marsh in 1879. Elmer Riggs reclassified Brontosaurus as <b>a</b> <b>synonym</b> of Apatosaurus in 1903, transferring the species B.excelsus to A.excelsus. In 2015 Tschopp, Mateus, and Benson argued that the species was distinct enough {{to be placed in}} its own genus, so they reclassified it back into Brontosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Apatosaurus grandis {{was named}} in 1877 by Marsh {{in the article}} that {{described}} A.ajax. It was briefly described, figured, and diagnosed. Marsh later mentioned it was only provisionally assigned to Apatosaurus when he reassigned it to his new genus Morosaurus in 1878.

50|$|In Powell, 1979, {{this species}} was {{referred}} to as Rangitotoa insularis.

5|$|First called Agaricus cinerellus by Finnish mycologist Petter Karsten in 1879, he {{transferred}} {{it to the}} genus Mycena that same year. In his 1936 Flora Agaricina Danica (Agaric flora of Denmark) Jakob Emanuel Lange referred it to the genus Omphalia; Omphalia cinerea (P. Karst.) J.E. Lange is now <b>a</b> <b>synonym.</b> Mycena cineroides was named and described as a new species distinct from M.cinerella by Hintikka in 1963, who thought it to be unique due to its narrowly acute cap that lacked brownish or yellowish tones, decurrent gills, and two-spored basidia. However, intermediate forms of it have been found, and some authorities, like Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus, believe it {{should be treated as}} <b>a</b> <b>synonym</b> of M.cinerella.|$|E

40|$|The {{sexuality}} of Solenostoma {{species is}} discussed {{and it is}} concluded that Solenostoma sanguinolentum is heteroicous. This and other morphological differences from Solenostoma marcescens are discussed and they are considered {{to belong to the}} same species. Heteroicity probably also occurs in Solenostoma micranthum and possibly in other Solenostoma species. Solenostoma rossicum and Solenostoma pyriflorum subsp. purpureum are new synonyms to Solenostoma sphaerocarpum. Solenostoma ochotense is <b>a</b> new <b>synonym</b> to Solenostoma hokkaidense. Solenostoma costaricanum is <b>a</b> new <b>synonym</b> to Solenostoma amoenum. Plectocolea subbalfourii is <b>a</b> new <b>synonym</b> to Solenostoma balfourii.

5|$|In practice, the MSE is a {{blend of}} empathic {{descriptive}} phenomenology and empirical clinical observation. It has been argued that the term phenomenology has become corrupted in clinical psychiatry: current usage, as a set of supposedly objective descriptions of a psychiatric patient (<b>a</b> <b>synonym</b> for signs and symptoms), is incompatible with the original meaning which was concerned with comprehending a patient's subjective experience.|$|E
5|$|Mycena arcangeliana {{was first}} {{described}} by Giacomo Bresadola in 1904; the species was listed along with 41 others found in Pisa, {{in an article}} by Egidio Barsali published in the Bollettino Della Societa Botanica Italiana (Bulletin of the Botanical Society of Italy). Authors Roger Phillips and Paul Sterry both describe the name Mycena oortiana as synonymous; M.oortiana was a name given by Frederich Hora in 1960 based on Robert Kühner's 1938 name for the variety Mycena arcangeliana var. oortiana, an invalid name. Phillips had earlier considered M. arcangeliana var. oortiana to be <b>a</b> <b>synonym</b> of M.oortiana, and MycoBank lists it as <b>a</b> <b>synonym</b> of Lucien Quélet's Mycena olivascens. However, Index Fungorum lists both M. olivascens and Kühner's Mycena vitilis var. olivascens as synonyms of M.arcangeliana. The specific epithet arcangeliana may be in honour of Giovanni Arcangeli, who collected the species in the Orto botanico di Pisa. M.arcangeliana {{is commonly known as}} the angel's bonnet, or the late-season bonnet.|$|E
5|$|One author {{regarded}} C.dentatus as <b>a</b> <b>synonym</b> of Coccomyces coronatus, although later {{authors have}} treated them separately.

5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} as Mycena austrororida by mycologist Rolf Singer in 1962, based on specimens he collected from Masatierra, in the Juan Fernandez Islands, Chile.

5|$|With the {{exception}} of Lambis and Terebellum, the remaining taxa were previously allocated in the genus Strombus, including L.gigas. However, according to Simone, only Strombus gracilior, Strombus alatus and Strombus pugilis, the type species, remained within Strombus, as they constituted a distinct group based on at least five synapomorphies (traits that are shared by two or more taxa and their most recent common ancestor). The remaining taxa were previously considered subgenera and were elevated to genus level by Simone. Genus Eustrombus (now considered <b>a</b> <b>synonym</b> of Lobatus), in this case, included Eustrombus gigas (now considered <b>a</b> <b>synonym</b> of Lobatus gigas) and Eustrombus goliath (= Lobatus goliath), which were thus considered closely related.|$|E
