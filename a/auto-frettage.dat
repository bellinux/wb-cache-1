40|$|Abstract. The yield {{strength}} of liner material affecting {{the performance of}} CNG-II composite cylinder was studied by finite element method (FEM) analysis. The {{yield strength}} of liner material 30 CrMo was changed from 730 MPa to 850 MPa with seven strength. The tensile strength of liner material, structural parameters of CNG-II composite cylinder and winding parameters were fixed as the yield strength of liner material changing. The <b>auto-frettage</b> effects of CNG-II composite cylinder became worse and the fatigue life of CNG-II composite cylinder lowered with the increasing of liner yield strength. The yield strength of liner should be lowered to some extent for improving the performance of CNG-II composite cylinder {{in the production of}} CNG-II composite cylinder...|$|E
40|$|This three-year project (FY 12 - 14) will {{design and}} {{demonstrate}} {{the ability of}} new Magnetic Stress Gages for the measurement of stresses on the inner diameter of a Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessel overwrap. The sensors are being tested at White Sands Testing Facility (WSTF) where {{the results will be}} correlated with a known nondestructive technique acoustic emission. The gages will be produced utilizing Meandering Winding Magnetometer (MWM) and/or MWM array eddy current technology. The ultimate goal is to utilize this technology for the health monitoring of Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels for all future flight programs. The first full-scale pressurization test was performed at WSTF in June 2012. The goals of this test were to determine adaptations of the magnetic stress gauge instrumentation that would be necessary to allow multiple sensors to monitor the vessel's condition simultaneously and to determine how the sensor response changes with sensor selection and orientation. The second full scale pressurization test was performed at WSTF in August 2012. The goals of this test were to monitor the vessel's condition with multiple sensors simultaneously, to determine the viability of the multiplexing units (MUX) for the application, and to determine if the sensor responses in different orientations are repeatable. For both sets of tests the vessel was pressured up to 6, 000 psi to simulate maximum operating pressure. Acoustic events were observed during the first pressurization cycle. This suggested that the extended storage period prior to use of this bottle led to a relaxation of the residual stresses imparted during <b>auto-frettage.</b> The pressurization tests successfully demonstrated the use of multiplexers with multiple MWM arrays to monitor a vessel. It was discovered that depending upon the sensor orientation, the frequencies, and the sense element, the MWM arrays can provide a variety of complementary information about the composite overwrapped pressure vessel load conditions. For example, low frequency measurements can be used to monitor the overwrap thickness and changes associated with pressure level. High frequency data is dominated by the properties of the overwrap, including the fiber orientations and lay-up of the layers...|$|E
50|$|The WAC-21 is {{very similar}} in many respects to the Austrian NORICUM GH N-45 gun-howitzer, {{to the extent that}} the {{carriage}} of the Type WA-021 can accommodate the ordnance of the NORICUM weapon. The NORINCO Type WA-021 has an <b>auto-frettaged</b> barrel 45 calibres long, fitted with a multibaffle muzzle brake, which has an efficiency of 30 percent. A screw-type breech mechanism opening to the right is employed and the chamber volume is 22.95 litres. The rifling employs 48 grooves with a twist of 1 in 20 calibres, and the grooves are understood to be three times deeper than the rifling depths found on comparable Western 155 mm designs.|$|R
50|$|Some 27 {{guns were}} {{built for the}} three ships of the Yamato-class battleship. Two thirds of the guns were lost with the sinking of IJN Yamato and IJN Musashi. As built, {{the design of the}} barrels was complex. A tube was built then <b>auto-frettaged</b> in three stages. A half length tube was fitted over the first tube and shrunk onto it. The {{assembly}} was then wire wound and two additional tubes shrunk over {{the entire length of the}} gun tubes. A final inner tube was then inserted down the gun and expanded into place. This inner tube was then rifled to finish the gun. As designed this gun could not cost effectively be relined but instead had to have the entire gun tube replaced due to wear.|$|R
25|$|Unlike the German {{practice}} of sliding block breeches {{that required a}} metallic cartridge case to seal the gun's chamber against combustion gases, Å koda preferred to use an interrupted screw breech with a deBange obdurator to seal the chamber. This lowered the rate of fire, but had the great economic advantage of allowing bagged propellant charges that didn't use scarce brass or steel cartridge case when those metals were in short supply. The other unusual feature of the gun was that it used a monobloc <b>auto-frettaged</b> barrel. This was {{a single piece of}} steel that was radially expanded under hydraulic pressure. This had the advantage of placing the steel of the barrel under compression, which helped it resist the stresses of firing and was simpler and faster to build since the barrel didn't require assembly as with more traditional construction techniques.|$|R
50|$|Al-Khalid is {{designed}} with a 125 mm bore, 48 calibre long smoothbore, <b>auto-frettaged</b> and chrome-plated gun barrel which is manufactured from highly stiff electroslag remelting steel. The gun is then put under stringent quality control process to ensure standard barrel life of 1,100 rounds EFC; barrels that cannot pass this test are rejected. This gun provides very high internal chamber pressures for APFSDS, HEAT FS and guided missiles. The gun can also fire the following types of conventional ammunition: APFSDS, HEAT-FS and HE-FS. The gun is a modified variant {{of both the}} ZPT-98 and KBA-3 series of 125 mm smooth bore gun for Al-Khalid MBT which provided compatibility with Ukrainian ATGMs such as Kombat. The gun retains qualities of both Chinese and Ukrainians mated with indigenous design for better and accurate firepower on stationary and moving targets alike. The Gun-launched, laser-guided anti-tank guided missiles can also be launched.|$|R
