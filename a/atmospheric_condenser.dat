The application of binary or multicomponent fluids {{may prove to be}} one of the successful ways to increase the ERS performance by 30 – 50 %. Zeotropic mixtures, which have unlimited solubility and evaporate at specified pressures and varying temperatures, are considered as possible candidates to be applied in a binary-fluid ERS (BERS). An ideal candidate working fluid should exhibit high molecular weight, low latent heat of evaporation, high normal boiling temperature and high compressibility factor. A refrigerant fluid should have low molecular weight, high latent heat of evaporation, low boiling point and compressibility factor. BERS pursues simultaneous achievement of two main goals: increase in system's efficiency and take the condensation point up to 45 – 50 °C at fixed coefficient of performance, i. e. employ <b>atmospheric</b> <b>condenser</b> in ERS. This article presents schematic diagrams of a multicomponent-fluid ERS; its cascade principle based on BERS enables to produce cold at several temperature ramps, using renewable or low-grade heat sources.

Here we show that the triplet state of 1 -nitronaphthalene (31 NN*) is able to directly react with phenol, causing its transformation upon irradiation of 1 NN in aqueous solution. Additional but less important processes of phenol degradation are reactions with OH and 1 O 2, both photogenerated by irradiated 1 NN. Dihydroxybiphenyls and phenoxyphenols were detected as main phenol transformation intermediates, likely formed by dimerisation of phenoxy radicals that would be produced upon phenol oxidation by 31 NN*. Very interestingly, irradiation with 1 NN shifted the fluorescence peaks of phenol (Ex/Em ¼ 220 e 230 / 280 e 320 nm and 250 e 275 / 280 e 320 nm, with Ex/ Em ¼ excitation and emission wavelengths) to a region that overlaps with "M-like" fulvic substances (Ex/ Em ¼ 250 e 300 / 330 e 400 nm).

40|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} (HOOH) is {{a significant}} oxidant in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>condensed</b> phases (e. g., cloud and fog drops, aqueous particles, and snow) that also photolyzes to form hydroxyl radical (•OH). •OH can react with organics in aqueous phases to form organic peroxyl radicals and ultimately reform HOOH, but the efficiency of this process in atmospheric aqueous phases, as well as snow and ice, is not well understood. We investigate HOOH formation from •OH attack on 10 environmentally relevant organic compounds: formaldehyde, formate, glycine, phenylalanine, benzoic acid, octanol, octanal, octanoic acid, octanedioic acid, and 2 -butoxyethanol. Liquid and ice samples with and without nitrate (as an •OH source) were illuminated using simulated solar light, and HOOH formation rates were measured {{as a function of}} pH and temperature. For most compounds, the formation rate of HOOH without nitrate was the same as the background formation rate in blank water (i. e., illumination of the organic species does not produce HOOH directly), while formation rates with nitrate were greater than the water control (i. e., reaction of •OH with the organic species forms HOOH). Yields of HOOH, defined as the rate of HOOH production divided by the rate of •OH production, ranged from essentially zero (glycine) to 0. 24 (octanal), with an average of 0. 12 ± 0. 05 (95 % CI). HOOH production rates and yields were higher at lower pH values. There was no temperature dependence of the HOOH yield for formaldehyde or octanedioic acid between − 5 to 20 °C and ice samples had approximately the same HOOH yield as the aqueous solutions. In contrast, HOOH yields in formate solutions were higher at 5 and 10 °C compared to − 5 and 20 °C. Yields of HOOH in ice for solutions containing nitrate and either phenylalanine, benzoate, octanal, or octanoic acid were indistinguishable from zero.

50|$|At {{the moment}} of the explosion, the {{fireball}} is formed. The ascending, roughly spherical mass of hot, incandescent gases changes shape due to atmospheric friction and cools its surface by energy radiation, turning from a sphere to a violently rotating spheroidal vortex. A Rayleigh-Taylor instability is formed as the underneath cool air initially pushes the bottom fireball gases into an inverted cup shape. This causes turbulence and a vortex that sucks more air into its center, creating external afterwinds and cooling itself. The speed of its rotating slows down as it cools, and may stop entirely during later phases. The vaporized parts of the weapon and ionized air cool into visible gases, forming the early cloud; the white-hot vortex core becomes yellow, then dark red, then loses visible incandescence.
