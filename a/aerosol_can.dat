5|$|In {{the sixth}} match, Ryusuke Taguchi defended the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against Kenny Omega of the Bullet Club. Distractions by the Bullet Club's Young Bucks allowed Omega to spray Taguchi {{in the eyes}} with an <b>aerosol</b> <b>can</b> and broke Taguchi's ankle lock on Omega later in the match. Omega {{captured}} the championship after a snap dragon suplex, a bicycle knee strike, and the One Winged Angel (electric chair dropped into a one-handed driver), pinning the champion at 13 minutes and 20 seconds.|$|E

50|$|A new {{development}} is the 2K (two component) aerosol. A 2K aerosol device has main component stored in main chamber and a second component stored in an accessory container. When applicator activates the 2K aerosol by breaking the accessory container, the two components mix. The 2K <b>aerosol</b> <b>can</b> has the advantage for delivery of reactive mixtures. For example, 2K reactive mixture can use low molecular weight monomer, oligomer, and functionalized low molecular polymer to make final cross-linked high molecular weight polymer. 2K <b>aerosol</b> <b>can</b> increase solid contents and deliver high performance polymer products, such as curable paints, foams, and adhesives.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} these {{requirements}} {{is to ensure that}} hazardous office waste is properly managed. They cover handling and disposal of such waste. They apply to workers, supervisors, and Waste Management. 2 Requirements Most people assume that waste accumulated in office areas may be disposed in the trash or recycled in the blue containers available for paper and plastic recycling. This is not true. Please see below for some common office wastes that need to be handled and disposed as hazardous waste. 2. 1 Toner and Inkjet Cartridges Almost all toner cartridges in laser and inkjet printers, fax machines, and copiers can be recycled and are generally picked up by the office supply vendor on the next scheduled delivery. Certain manufacturers supply prepaid packaging for used cartridges, but vendor pickup is preferred. Check with the administrative assistant in your work area for pickup procedures or contact the Waste Management Group. 2. 2 <b>Aerosol</b> <b>Cans</b> – Office Pressurized <b>aerosol</b> <b>cans</b> containing such products as room freshener and pressurized air (for dust removal) are considered hazardous waste. To dispose of properly, submit a completed Hazardous Waste Pick-Up and Empty Container Request Form to Waste Management. Waste <b>aerosol</b> <b>cans</b> (both empty and partially empty) must be stored in a collection drum specifically designated for <b>aerosol</b> <b>cans.</b> Empty and partially empty aerosol may be mixed, but no <b>aerosol</b> <b>cans</b> may be mixed with other wastes For pump spray bottles containing hazardous materials, see “Chemical Containers ” in Hazardous Waste: Management Requirements. 2. 3 Miscellaneous Office Product...|$|R
