40|$|The {{variability}} of the flavonoid content of two populations of Z. noltii from different geographical zones, i. e., the Bay of Arcachon and the Bay of Cadiz, was evaluated. Samples {{were collected in}} spring and autumn at the two sites, and extracts were prepared by maceration in water. The phenolic content was fully characterized using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), UV and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS), and the concentration of the individual phenolic was determined by quantitative High-Performance Liquid Chromatography with Diode-Array Detection (HPLC-DAD). The two populations show a strong geographical differentiation in their flavonoid content. The samples from Cadiz were dominated by apigenin 7 -sulfate, which represents 71 % (<b>autumn</b> <b>collection)</b> and 83 % (spring collection) of the total flavonoids, whereas the samples from Arcachon were characterized by diosmetin 7 -sulfate (85 and 93 % of the total flavonoids). Structural elucidation of the individual phenolics was assigned using the complementary information from their spectral evidence. In addition, the results were confirmed by acid hydrolysis of the flavonoid sulfates, and comparison to synthetic standards obtained by sulfation of apigenin, diosmetin and luteolin. The results represent the first experimental evidence {{of the existence of}} chemotypes within the species Z. noltii...|$|E
40|$|Two study plots, {{burned and}} control, were {{established}} in autumn 1998 in a Quercus ilex forest located in northern Spain, part {{of which had been}} affected by a low intensity fire in 1994. Soil samples for ectomycorrhizae (ECM) were taken over a 3 -year period in each study plot in spring, summer, autumn and winter. ECM morphotypes were identified and the relative abundance of each morphotype in each soil sample calculated, along with species richness, Shannon diversity index and percentage of mycorrhization in each soil sample. The relative abundance of certain ECM morphotypes differed between burned and control plots, and the percentage of mycorrhizal tips was significantly lower in the burned than in the control plot. Nevertheless, {{there were no significant differences}} in the diversity, species richness or species composition of the ECM community in the burned and control plots. The dominant ECM morphotypes in both stands were Cenococcum geophilum and several thelephoroid fungi. Sphaerosporella brunnea and Pisolithus tinctorius thrived especially in the burned plot, whereas three ectomycorrhizal morphotypes assigned to the genus Hebeloma were especially abundant in the control plot. There was no significant variation in the relative abundance of the ECM morphotypes between seasons, but ECM community species richness was highest in autumn and lowest in summer. The percentage of mycorrhizal tips reached a maximum in winter, with its minimum in <b>autumn.</b> <b>Collection</b> of samples over the 3 -year period also enabled us to detect a significant increase in percentage of ECM colonisation in the burned stand over time...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAromatic plants contain both {{volatile}} and non-volatile fractions and the chemical composition {{of these two}} fractions {{may be influenced by}} seasonal changes. The essential oil and solvent extracts of S. africana-caerulea, S. africana-lutea and S. lanceolata, collected at the same locality throughout the 2005 growing season, were compared in terms of essential oil composition, yields and biological activities. Mostly quantitative, rather than qualitative variation was observed in the oil composition of each species. Major fluctuations in the composition of S. africana-caerulea oil included limonene (2 – 33 %) and viridiflorol (2 – 24 %). Levels of α-pinene (1 – 12 %), myrcene (2 – 12 %) and α-eusdesmol (trace- 13 %) fluctuated seasonally in the S. africana-lutea oil. In S. lanceolata, considerable changes were noted for β-caryophyllene (1 – 19 %), β-caryophyllene oxide (1 – 21 %) and ledol (3 – 12 %). The extract prepared from S. lanceolata harvested in winter was more active against Gram-positive bacteria. The S. africana-caerulea extract exhibited the most favourable anti-plasmodial activity when harvested in winter (IC 50 value: 12  μg ml− 1), which contrasts with the lowest anti-plasmodial activity of S. lanceolata obtained at the same period (IC 50 value: 43  μg ml− 1). The anti-oxidant activity of the solvent extracts also displayed variation over seasons with the winter collection of S. africana-lutea yielding the most favourable anti-oxidant activity (IC 50 value: 10  μg ml− 1).

40|$|T- 2 and HT- 2 toxins (T- 2 and HT- 2) are {{important}} trichothecenes. They {{have been subject}} of formal risk assessment by various organisations, including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The EFSA CONTAM Panel recently established a group Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) of 100 ng/kg body weight/day for the sum of T- 2 and HT- 2. To assess the actual dietary exposure of Dutch consumers to T- 2 and HT- 2 a {{study was conducted in}} the Netherlands, in which duplicate portions of 24 -h diets collected in 2011 were investigated for these toxins. This collection comprised 128 duplicate diets of the adult segment of the Dutch population, divided over a spring and <b>autumn</b> <b>collection</b> period. The diets in the study were homogenised and processed to lyophilised powders. Aliquots of every two of the samples were pooled to test portions that were analysed with a method, based on immunoaffinity chromatography clean-up in combination with GC-MS/MS determination. The method had a limit of quantification of 0. 01 mu g/kg original non-lyophilised diet for both T- 2 and HT- 2. Recoveries ranged from 92 - 114 % for T- 2 and from 71 - 106 % for HT- 2, determined at levels of addition ranging from 0. 1 - 0. 3 mu g/kg. In practically all samples investigated, numerical values for the concentrations of T- 2 and HT- 2 could be obtained. Exposure estimates of the sum of T- 2 and HT- 2 in the 2011 study ranged from non-detectable to 18. 6 ng/kg body weight/day. In addition limited sets of pooled samples of duplicate diets retained from collections in the period 1976 - 2004 were analysed for T- 2 and HT- 2. In all samples the mean and individual intakes of the sum of T- 2 and HT- 2 of the respondents were below the group TDI of the EFSA CONTAM Panel. From this study it was concluded that no health risks are expected from current exposure of adult Dutch consumers to T- 2 and HT- 2...|$|E

To compare these growth curves, we used a nonlinear model and used maximum likelihood estimates and likelihood ratio tests. We found that growth rates were similar between periods, but intercepts and variances of growth curves differed. From this we infer that calves were smaller in autumn during the 1960 s and that significant compensatory growth did not occur later in life...|$|R
