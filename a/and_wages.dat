40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} role of {{temporary}} price <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> rigidities in explaining the dynamic relationship between money, real output, and inflation. It summarizes microeconomic data on price <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> setting behavior, <b>and</b> argues that staggered price <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> setting models provide the most satisfactory match with the data. Research in this area has been very active in the 1990 's with a remarkable number of studies using, estimating, or testing models of staggered price <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> setting. A new generation of econometric models incorporating staggered price <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> setting with rational expectations has been built. Researchers have begun to incorporate staggered <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> price setting into real business cycle models. Close links have been discovered between the parameters of people's utility functions and the parameters of price <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> setting equations. There is now a debate about whether standard calibrations of utility functions prevent staggered price models, at least those with frequent price changes, from explaining long persistence of real output. There is much to be discovered from these debates and from the future research they stimulate. ...|$|R

30|$|However, by {{consideration}} of the long-run development the picture indicates some kind of cyclicality in wage growth for high-skilled workers: <b>wage</b> growth <b>and</b> entry <b>wages</b> increased for cohorts entering the labor market after the mid- 1980 s.

5|$|Bernardo Grinspun, {{the first}} {{minister}} of the economy, arranged an increase in wages, reaching the levels of 1975. This caused inflation to reach 32%. He also tried to negotiate more favourable terms on the country's foreign debt, but the negotiations failed. Risking a default, he negotiated with the IMF, which requested spending cuts. International credits prevented default {{at the end of}} 1984, but he resigned in March 1985 when the debt reached $1billion and the IMF denied further credits. Grinspun was succeeded by Juan Vital Sourrouille, who designed the Austral plan. This plan froze prices <b>and</b> <b>wages,</b> stopped the printing of money, arranged spending cuts, and established a new currency, the Austral. The plan was a success in the short term, and choked inflation. Inflation rose again {{by the end of the}} year, the CGT opposed the wage freeze, and business community opposed the price freeze.

The plan was dropped and the reliable soldiers from the unit were merged into the Ireland expeditionary force and the rest returned to prison. Reinforcements from the Mediterranean Fleet were also delayed: seven ships from the expedition under Contre-amiral Joseph de Richery had to shelter from the British blockade squadron in Rochefort, only arriving in Brest on 8 December, while a second squadron under Contre-amiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve did not arrive until after the expeditionary force had departed.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates <b>wage</b> {{inequality}} <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> mobility in Turkey {{using the}} Surveys on Income and Living Conditions (SILC). This {{is the first}} paper that explores wage mobility for Turkey. It differs from the existing literature by providing analyses of <b>wage</b> inequality <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> mobility over various socioeconomic groups such as gender, age, education and sector of economic activity. We first present {{an overview of the}} evolution of <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> inequality over the period 2005 - 2011. Next, we compute several measures of <b>wage</b> mobility <b>and</b> explore the link between <b>wage</b> inequality <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> mobility. Further, we compute the transition matrices which show movements of individuals across the wage distribution from one period to another and investigate the determinants of transition probabilities using a multinomial logit model. The results show that overall the real wages increased over the study period <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> inequality exhibits a slight increase. Wage inequality is one of the highest among the European Union (EU) countries. The wage mobility in Turkey is lower than what is observed in the European Union countries although it increases as time horizon expands. Wage mobility has an equalizing impact on the wage distribution, however; this impact is not substantial enough to overcome the high <b>and</b> persistent <b>wage</b> inequality in Turkey...|$|R
