30|$|Introduction: Patients {{surviving}} the <b>acute</b> <b>phases</b> of critical illness, complications as polyneuropathy and prolonged mechanical ventilation can appear. A {{high level of}} uncertainty exists regarding to prognostication of outcomes in these patients. Chronical critical illness is usually considered when invasive mechanical ventilation is prolonged for at least 21  days after acute illness.|$|R
5|$|Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} (GBS) is a rapid-onset {{muscle weakness}} {{caused by the}} immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. The initial symptoms are typically changes in sensation or pain along with muscle weakness, beginning in the feet and hands. This often spreads to the arms and upper body with both sides being involved. The symptoms develop over hours to a few weeks. During the <b>acute</b> <b>phase,</b> the disorder can be life-threatening with about 15% developing weakness of the breathing muscles requiring mechanical ventilation. Some are affected by changes in {{the function of the}} autonomic nervous system, which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|If {{symptoms}} develop {{during the}} <b>acute</b> <b>phase,</b> they usually resolve spontaneously within three {{to eight weeks}} in approximately 90% of individuals. Although the symptoms resolve, even with treatment the infection persists and enters a chronic phase. Of individuals with chronic Chagas disease, 60–80% will never develop symptoms (called indeterminate chronic Chagas disease), while the remaining 20–40% will develop life-threatening heart and/or digestive disorders during their lifetime (called determinate chronic Chagas disease). In 10% of individuals, the disease progresses directly from the acute form to a symptomatic clinical form of chronic Chagas disease.|$|E
5|$|Studies suggest {{antiparasitic}} treatment {{leads to}} parasitological cure {{in more than}} 90% of infants but only about 60–85% of adults treated {{in the first year}} of <b>acute</b> <b>phase</b> Chagas disease. Children aged six to 12 years with chronic disease have a cure rate of about 60% with benznidazole. While the rate of cure declines the longer an adult has been infected with Chagas, treatment with benznidazole has been shown to slow the onset of heart disease in adults with chronic Chagas infections.|$|E

50|$|One review {{found that}} {{antihypertensive}} therapy {{to bring down}} the blood pressure in <b>acute</b> <b>phases</b> appears to improve outcomes. Other reviews found an unclear difference between intensive and less intensive blood pressure control. The American Heart Association and American Stroke Association guidelines in 2015 recommended decreasing the blood pressure to a SBP of 140 mmHg.|$|R
5|$|The <b>acute</b> <b>phase</b> {{lasts for}} the first few weeks or months of infection. It usually occurs unnoticed because it is symptom-free or {{exhibits}} only mild symptoms that are not unique to Chagas disease. These can include fever, fatigue, body aches, muscle pain, headache, rash, loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. The signs on physical examination can include mild enlargement of the liver or spleen, swollen glands, and local swelling (a chagoma) where the parasite entered the body.|$|E
5|$|The most {{recognized}} {{marker of}} acute Chagas disease is called Romaña's sign, which includes {{swelling of the}} eyelids {{on the side of}} the face near the bite wound or where the bug feces were deposited or accidentally rubbed into the eye. Rarely, young children, or adults may die from the acute disease due to severe inflammation/infection of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or brain (meningoencephalitis). The <b>acute</b> <b>phase</b> also can be severe in people with weakened immune systems.|$|E
5|$|Galiella rufa {{produces}} several structurally related hexaketide {{compounds that}} have attracted attention for their biological properties: pregaliellalactone, galiellalactone. The compounds have anti-nematodal activity, killing the nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans and Meloidogyne incognita. These compounds {{have been shown}} in laboratory tests to inhibit the early steps of the biosynthetic pathways induced by plant hormones known as gibberellic acids, and they also inhibit the germination of seeds of several plants. Galiellalactone is additionally a highly selective and potent inhibitor of interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling in HepG2 cells. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine which is produced by a large variety of cells and functions as a regulator of immune response, <b>acute</b> <b>phase</b> reactions, and hematopoiesis.

5|$|Neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes {{that travel}} {{throughout}} the body in pursuit of invading pathogens. Neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte, normally representing 50% to 60% of the total circulating leukocytes. During the <b>acute</b> <b>phase</b> of inflammation, particularly {{as a result of}} bacterial infection, neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis, and are usually the first cells to arrive at the scene of infection. Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and: (i) produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes, complement proteins, and cytokines, while they can also (ii) act as scavengers that rid the body of worn-out cells and other debris, and as antigen-presenting cells that activate the adaptive immune system.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, HIV causes AIDS by {{depleting}} CD4+ T cells. This {{weakens the}} immune system and allows opportunistic infections. T cells are essential to the immune response and without them, the body cannot fight infections or kill cancerous cells. The mechanism of CD4+ T cell depletion differs in the acute and chronic phases. During the <b>acute</b> <b>phase,</b> HIV-induced cell lysis and killing of infected cells by cytotoxic T cells accounts for CD4+ T cell depletion, although apoptosis may also be a factor. During the chronic phase, the consequences of generalized immune activation coupled with the gradual loss of the ability of {{the immune system}} to generate new T cells appear to account for the slow decline in CD4+ T cell numbers.|$|E
5|$|These {{laboratory}} tests are only of diagnostic value during the <b>acute</b> <b>phase</b> {{of the illness}} {{with the exception of}} serology. Tests for dengue virus-specific antibodies, types IgG and IgM, can be useful in confirming a diagnosis in the later stages of the infection. Both IgG and IgM are produced after 5–7 days. The highest levels (titres) of IgM are detected following a primary infection, but IgM is also produced in reinfection. IgM becomes undetectable 30–90 days after a primary infection, but earlier following re-infections. IgG, by contrast, remains detectable for over 60 years and, in the absence of symptoms, is a useful indicator of past infection. After a primary infection, IgG reaches peak levels in the blood after 14–21 days. In subsequent re-infections, levels peak earlier and the titres are usually higher. Both IgG and IgM provide protective immunity to the infecting serotype of the virus. In testing for IgG and IgM antibodies there may be cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses which may result in a false positive after recent infections or vaccinations with yellow fever virus or Japanese encephalitis. The detection of IgG alone is not considered diagnostic unless blood samples are collected 14 days apart and a greater than fourfold increase in levels of specific IgG is detected. In a person with symptoms, the detection of IgM is considered diagnostic.|$|E

Methods: A total of 181 COPD cases were divided to be COPD stable phase group (65 cases) and COPD <b>acute</b> exacerbation <b>phase</b> group (116 cases) per {{the course of}} disease. COPD <b>acute</b> exacerbation <b>phase</b> group was classified into grade I (39 cases), grade II (43 cases) and grade III (34 cases) based on pulmonary function. Then survival group (87 cases) and death group (29 cases) were divided based on illness transition. Meanwhile, 80 cases of healthy people at the same phase were set to be healthy group. Differences in levels of Serum hs-CRP, IL- 6 and FIB in these groups were analyzed, and according to these indexes, prognostic potency of COPD <b>acute</b> exacerbation <b>phase</b> could be evaluated. Results: Difference in serum hs-CRP, IL- 6 and FIB levels in COPD stable <b>phase</b> group, COPD <b>acute</b> exacerbation <b>phase</b> group and healthy group were statistical significant (P< 0. 05). both for healthy group <COPD stable phase group < COPD <b>acute</b> exacerbation <b>phase</b> group.

40|$|Background. The role of {{ischemia}} reperfusion {{contributing to}} functional impairment in lower extremity {{peripheral arterial disease}} (PAD) patients has not previously been elucidated. The evaluation of gait variability patterns has proven useful in many pathologic populations. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study is to isolate and determine the specific effect of the <b>acute</b> reperfusion <b>phase</b> of ischemia-reperfusion on gait variability in young individuals with no vascular disease. Materials and Methods. Thirty healthy young individuals walked on a treadmill during baseline and the <b>acute</b> reperfusion <b>phase</b> of ischemia-reperfusion conditions while lower extremity joint kinematics were captured. Stride to stride variability was assessed using the largest Lyapunov exponent, approximate entropy, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation. Differences in gait variability between conditions were assessed using dependent t-tests. Results. The largest Lyapunov exponent values and approximate entropy values were significantly higher in the <b>acute</b> reperfusion <b>phase</b> of ischemiareperfusion condition for the ankle, knee, and the hip. Coefficient of variation was significantly higher at the hip and standard deviation was higher at the knee and the hip during the <b>acute</b> reperfusion <b>phase</b> of ischemia-reperfusion condition. Conclusions. The <b>acute</b> reperfusion <b>phase</b> of the ischemia-reperfusion cycle alters gait variability patterns at the ankle, knee, and the hip in healthy young individuals.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Anaesthetic {{preconditioning}} (APC) exerts cardioprotective effects {{by reducing}} infarct size and improving recovery of contractile function after ischaemia-reperfusion. The interval between brief exposure to volatile anaesthetic and sustained ischaemia, the <b>acute</b> memory <b>phase,</b> {{is dependent on}} intracellular signalling mediating this cardioprotection. Intramyocyte translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) {{is known to be}} a key mediator in APC. We examined the relationship between the time frame of the <b>acute</b> memory <b>phase</b> of sevoflurane preconditioning and intramyocyte translocation of PKC-alpha, delta and epsilon to the particulate fraction. METHODS: Isolated perfused guinea pig hearts were subjected to 30 min ischaemia and 120 min reperfusion. APC was elicited with one minimum alveolar concentration sevoflurane for 10 min. Washout times of 10, 30, 60 and 90 min were studied. Contractile recovery was assessed by monitoring left ventricular developed pressures. Infarct size was determined by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Translocation of PKC was examined by western blot analysis. RESULTS: After ischaemia-reperfusion, left ventricular developed pressure recovered to a greater degree with APC compared with control for washout times of 10 and 30 min, but not 60 and 90 min. Similarly, infarct size was reduced for washout times of 10 and 30 min, but not 60 and 90 min. Sustained translocation of PKC-alpha and epsilon, but not delta, was associated with the time frame of the <b>acute</b> memory <b>phase.</b> CONCLUSION: The <b>acute</b> memory <b>phase</b> of sevoflurane preconditioning is limited to less than 60 min. Sustained translocation of PKC-alpha and epsilon, but not delta, correlates with this <b>acute</b> memory <b>phase</b> of sevoflurane preconditioning...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To compare clinicopathological {{features}} of acute presentation of type 1 autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) {{with or without}} centrilobular necrosis (CN). METHODS: Our study comprised 41 patients with biopsy-proven acute presentation (<b>acute</b> exacerbation <b>phase</b> 36, <b>acute</b> hepatitis <b>phase</b> 5) of type 1 AIH at our hospital from 1975 to 2009. Elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (> 5 x upper limit of normal) identified acute presentation of the disease. We compared clinicopathological {{features of}} these AIH patients with or without CN. The data used for analysis included patient background (age, sex, type of disease, presence of complications with other autoimmune diseases, human leukocyte antigen, and International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group score), clinical parameters at presentation (ALT, alkaline phosphatase, IgG, anti-nuclear antibodies, and anti-smooth muscle antibodies), histology and therapy. RESULTS: CN was found in 13 (31. 7 %) patients with acute presentation (<b>acute</b> exacerbation <b>phase</b> 10, <b>acute</b> hepatitis <b>phase</b> 3) of AIH. Serum IgG levels of patients with CN were significantly {{lower than those of}} patients without CN (mean: 2307 mg/dL vs 3126 mg/dL, P < 0. 05), while antinuclear antibody-negative rates were significantly higher (30. 7 % vs 3. 5 %, P < 0. 05). However, other clinical features were similar between the two groups. The frequency of advanced fibrosis in patients with CN was significantly lower than in patients without CN (F 0 - 2 : 84. 6 % vs 35. 7 %, F 3 - 4 : 15. 4 % vs 64. 3 %, P < 0. 05). Other histological features were similar between the two groups. Although {{there was no significant difference}} between groups when evaluated using the revised original score (12 vs 14), the simplified AIH score of patients with CN was significantly lower (6 vs 7, P < 0. 05). Frequency of DR 4 was similar between patients with and without CN. CONCLUSION: CN is observed in both Japanese patients with <b>acute</b> hepatitis <b>phase</b> and <b>acute</b> exacerbation <b>phase</b> of type 1 AIH, although AIH with CN often shows clinical features of the genuine acute form...|$|R
