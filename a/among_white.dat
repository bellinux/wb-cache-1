Waters had already been a well-known blues musician across Europe and the United States in the '50s. His successful performances with his electric blues band, consisting of his half-brother Otis Spann (piano, vocals), Pat Hare (guitar), James Cotton (harmonica), Andrew Stevens (bass) and Francis Clay (drums), increasingly popularized the blues in mainstream music in the United States and Europe, especially <b>among</b> <b>white</b> audiences.|$|E
5|$|In 1847, the Whitman {{massacre}} and the Cayuse War in {{what became}} southeastern Washington raised fears <b>among</b> <b>white</b> settlers {{throughout the region}} {{and led to the}} formation of large volunteer militias organized to fight Indians. Along the Rogue, tensions intensified in 1848 at the start of the California Gold Rush, when hundreds of men from the Oregon Territory passed through the Rogue Valley on their way to the Sacramento River basin. After Indians attacked a group of returning miners along the Rogue in 1850, former territorial governor Joseph Lane negotiated a peace treaty with Apserkahar, a leader of the Takelma Indians. It promised protection of Indian rights and safe passage through the Rogue Valley for white miners and settlers.|$|E
5|$|Weaver {{embarked}} on a speaking tour across the northern plains and Pacific coast states. In late August, he turned South, hoping to break the Democrats' grip on those states. As in 1880, {{the issue of race}} hurt Weaver <b>among</b> <b>white</b> Southern voters, as he sought to attract black voters by urging cooperation between white and black farmers and calling for an end to lynchings. Weaver drew good crowds in the South, but {{he and his wife were}} also subjected to abuse from hecklers. Southern Democrats depicted Weaver as a threat to the conservative Democrats in power there; with the increasing disenfranchisement of black voters, this was to prove fatal to the Populists' hopes in the South.|$|E

5|$|Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull, {{leader of}} the Moderate Republicans and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was anxious to reach an {{understanding}} with the President. He ushered through Congress a bill extending the Freedmen's Bureau beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867, and the first Civil Rights Bill, to grant citizenship to the freedmen. Trumbull met several times with Johnson, and was convinced the President would sign the measures (Johnson rarely contradicted visitors, often fooling those who met with him into thinking he was in accord). In fact, the President opposed both bills as infringements on state sovereignty. Additionally, both of Trumbull's bills were unpopular <b>among</b> <b>white</b> Southerners, whom Johnson hoped to include in his new party. Johnson vetoed the Freedman's Bureau bill on February 18, 1866, {{to the delight of}} white Southerners and the puzzled anger of Republican legislators. He considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the Senate the following day. Johnson believed that the Radicals would now be isolated and defeated, and that the Moderate Republicans would form behind him; he did not understand that Moderates too wanted to see African Americans treated fairly.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, Makeba {{sang the}} lead female {{role in the}} Broadway-inspired South African jazz opera King Kong; among those in the cast was the {{musician}} Hugh Masekela. The musical was performed to racially integrated audiences, raising her profile <b>among</b> <b>white</b> South Africans. Also in 1959, she had a short guest appearance in Come Back, Africa, an anti-apartheid film produced and directed by the American independent filmmaker Lionel Rogosin. Rogosin cast her after seeing her on stage in African Jazz and Variety show, on which Makeba was a performer for 18 months. The film blended elements of documentary and fiction {{and had to be}} filmed in secret as the government was expected to be hostile to it. Makeba appeared on stage, and sang two songs: her appearance lasted four minutes. The cameo made an enormous impression on viewers, and Rogosin organised a visa for her to attend the premiere of the film at the twenty-fourth Venice Film Festival in Italy, where the film won the prestigious Critics' Choice Award. Makeba's presence has been described as crucial to the film, as an emblem of cosmopolitan black identity that also connected with working-class black people due to the dialogue being in Zulu.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, {{before a}} tour by the New Zealand rugby team, the South African {{government}} asked New Zealand to field an all-white team (thereby excluding Māori players); the New Zealand Rugby Football Union refused and cancelled the tour. As rugby was very popular <b>among</b> <b>white</b> South Africans, this caused concern in that community. The England cricket team was in New Zealand at the time, and Billy Griffith, {{by then the}} secretary of the MCC, when questioned said that the MCC would also cancel in similar circumstances. Despite these events in other world sports, South Africa continued to play international cricket. Efforts to put pressure on the International Cricket Conference (ICC) failed, and even when South Africa withdrew from the Commonwealth in 1961 (theoretically forfeiting the national team's Test status), their traditional opponents continued to play official Tests against them despite opposition from India, Pakistan and the West Indies.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{observations}} {{suggest a}} preponderance of cases of sporadic Alzheimer's disease <b>among</b> <b>whites</b> relative to blacks.

Among the remaining 144 cases, the proportions of whites and blacks were similar, yet the frequency of Alzheimer's disease was 2. 6 times higher <b>among</b> <b>whites</b> (P = 0. 001), dementia due to Parkinson's disease was more frequent <b>among</b> <b>whites</b> (P = 0. 05), and the frequencies of multi-infarct dementia and dementia due to chronic ethanol abuse were higher among blacks (P = 0. 004 and P = 0. 007, respectively). Moreover, in brains from neurologically intact controls, incidental histologic lesions of Alzheimer's disease were observed more frequently in whites than blacks (P = 0. 01).

40|$|Discomfort during interracial {{interactions}} {{is common}} <b>among</b> <b>Whites</b> in the U. S. and {{is linked to}} avoidance of interracial encounters. While {{the negative consequences of}} interracial discomfort are well-documented, understanding of its causes is still incomplete. Alcohol consumption has been shown to decrease negative emotions caused by self-presentational concern but increase negative emotions associated with racial prejudice. Using novel behavioral-expressive measures of emotion, we examined the impact of alcohol on displays of discomfort <b>among</b> 92 <b>White</b> individuals interacting in all-White or interracial groups. We used the Facial Action Coding System and comprehensive content-free speech analyses to examine affective and behavioral dynamics during these 36 -min exchanges (7. 9 million frames of video data). <b>Among</b> <b>Whites</b> consuming nonalcoholic beverages, those assigned to interracial groups evidenced more facial and speech displays of discomfort than those in all-White groups. In contrast, <b>among</b> intoxicated <b>Whites</b> there were no differences in displays of discomfort between interracial and all-White groups. Results highlight the central role of self-presentational concerns in interracial discomfort and offer new directions for applying theory and methods from emotion science to the examination of intergroup relations...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has indicated that the influence of peers on adolescent smoking may differ across ethnic groups. Although many studies have focused on African Americans, Hispanics, and Whites, few studies have included Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, and multi-ethnic adolescents as distinct groups. Using data from a statewide sample of 5870 eighth-grade adolescents in California, this study examined ethnic differences in the association between peer influence variables and smoking behavior and susceptibility. Informational peer influence (best friends 2 ̆ 7 smoking behavior) and normative peer influence (prevalence estimates of peer smoking) were investigated. We hypothesized that informational peer influences would be stronger <b>among</b> <b>Whites</b> (whose families originate primarily from the individualistic cultures of the USA and Western Europe) than among Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, Hispanics, and African Americans (whose families originate primarily from collectivist cultures). Conversely, we hypothesized that normative peer influences would be stronger among ethnic minority adolescents from collectivist cultural backgrounds than <b>among</b> <b>Whites.</b> Consistent with previous studies, friends 2 ̆ 7 smoking and prevalence estimates of peer smoking were risk factors for past 30 -day smoking and susceptibility to smoking across ethnic groups. The influence of friends 2 ̆ 7 smoking behavior was stronger <b>among</b> <b>Whites</b> than <b>among</b> several other groups: Pacific Islanders, African Americans, and Hispanic/Latinos. The influence of prevalence estimates of peer smoking was stronger <b>among</b> <b>Whites</b> than <b>among</b> multiethnic adolescents. Results indicate that cultural factors {{may play a role in}} peer influences on smoking initiation. Smoking prevention interventions for adolescents should address the differences in peer influences across ethnic groups...|$|R
