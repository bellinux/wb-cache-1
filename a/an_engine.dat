5|$|HB1002 {{was lost}} on 11July1979 during the aircraft's 52nd flight. A {{hydraulic}} leak caused <b>an</b> <b>engine</b> fire, {{resulting in the}} loss of hydraulic pressure, which in turn caused severe pitch oscillations. The pilot ejected safely, and the aircraft was destroyed. It was later discovered that <b>an</b> <b>engine</b> exhaust clamp had loosened, allowing the hot exhaust to migrate to the right engine compartment. The heat built up there, causing the hydraulic lines to fail. The debris from both aircraft was secretly buried somewhere within the Nellis complex. Despite the crashes, Have Blue was considered a success.|$|E
5|$|The type's first fatal {{accident}} occurred on 30 June 1994 near Toulouse {{on a test}} flight when an Airbus-owned A330-300 crashed while simulating <b>an</b> <b>engine</b> failure on climbout, killing all seven on board. Airbus subsequently advised A330 operators to disconnect the autopilot and limit pitch attitude {{in the event of}} <b>an</b> <b>engine</b> failure at low speed.|$|E
5|$|Another Congolese Su-25K {{crashed on}} 30 June 2007 during an Independence Day display, {{near the city}} of Kisangani, killing the pilot. Investigations {{revealed}} that the crash was due to <b>an</b> <b>engine</b> failure.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> V10 <b>engine</b> is <b>a</b> V <b>engine</b> with 10 {{cylinders}} in two {{banks of}} five. It {{is longer than}} <b>a</b> V8 <b>engine</b> but shorter than <b>a</b> straight-6 <b>engine</b> or V12 engine.|$|R
50|$|In 1904, Léon Levavasseur, the {{engineer}} for the Antoinette <b>engine</b> manufacturer conceptualized <b>a</b> modular <b>engine</b> design {{that would include}} <b>a</b> V8 <b>engine,</b> <b>a</b> V16 <b>engine,</b> and <b>a</b> V32 <b>engine.</b> Antoinette built <b>a</b> prototype V16 in 1907, and an aircraft equipped with an Antoinette V16 competed in the 1910 Gordon Bennett Cup at Belmont Park in the United States.|$|R
5|$|Anthony Davidson {{missed out}} on the second session of qualifying, putting his Super Aguri in 17th position, 3 places behind his {{teammate}} Sato. Ralf Schumacher and his team were disappointed with qualifying in 18th. Heikki Kovalainen crashed into the wall at turn 5, damaging his rear suspension and losing his rear wing, resulting in the session being stopped temporarily. Once the debris had been cleared, Kovalainen in his repaired car managed one impressive lap that put him in 13th, after which six drivers outqualified him. Kovalainen then had to make <b>an</b> <b>engine</b> change due to <b>an</b> <b>engine</b> failure and was demoted {{to the back of}} the grid. Wurz, Sutil and Albers qualified in 19th, 20th and 21st respectively after being pushed up a place by Kovalainen's engine change.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from his}} 1965 victory, he never {{finished}} {{the race in}} Le Mans. In 1966, his Ford GT40 (shared with Innes Ireland) suffered <b>an</b> <b>engine</b> failure. A year later, he drove a Porsche 907 with Gerhard Mitter until their camshaft failed.|$|E
5|$|Each engine {{had its own}} {{intake and}} the engine {{nacelles}} were paired with a splitter plate between them to minimise adverse behaviour of one powerplant influencing the other. Only above Mach 1.6 was <b>an</b> <b>engine</b> surge likely to affect the adjacent engine.|$|E
50|$|The <b>A</b> <b>engine</b> {{was first}} {{released}} in 1956, {{and was used}} exclusively in Plymouths until 1958. The cylinder bore center distance is 4.46 in, larger than the earlier Dodge-based poly <b>engines.</b> The <b>A</b> <b>engine</b> formed the conceptual design basis of its successor, the LA engine.|$|R
50|$|The car is {{available}} with three <b>engine</b> options: <b>a</b> 1.6-litre <b>engine,</b> <b>a</b> 1.8-litre <b>engine</b> or <b>a</b> 2.0-litre <b>engine.</b> <b>A</b> hybrid version, named Chery A5ISG or A5BSG, is also produced. It {{is considered to}} be the first Chinese-designed mass-production hybrid vehicle. It is equipped with safety features such as ABS, EBD and ESP.|$|R
50|$|The Chrysler <b>A</b> <b>engine</b> is <b>a</b> small-block V8 {{automobile}} engine from Chrysler Corporation. It {{was produced}} from 1956 until 1967, {{when it was}} replaced by the wedge-head LA <b>engine.</b> The <b>A</b> <b>engine's</b> combustion chambers are polyspherical, and it is not related to Chrysler's Hemi engines of the same era.|$|R
5|$|In 1850 <b>an</b> <b>engine</b> shed {{had been}} {{opened on the}} south bank of the River Avon {{on the east side}} of the line to the B station. Between 1859 and 1875, 23 engines were built in the {{workshops}} attached to the shed, including several distinctive Bristol and Exeter Railway 4-2-4T locomotives.|$|E
5|$|In January 2017, {{during a}} special forces raid in Yemen, two MV-22s {{were called in}} to {{evacuate}} the special forces troops. One Osprey suffered <b>an</b> <b>engine</b> failure causing a hard landing which injured two of the crew, and was later destroyed with a guided bomb.|$|E

5|$|Overseen by Cyril Lovesey, {{flight testing}} {{commenced}} on 4 August 1929 {{in the new}} Supermarine S.6 at RAF Calshot, a seaplane and flying boat station on Southampton Water in Hampshire. During pre-race scrutineering tests, metal particles were found {{on two of the}} engine's 24 spark plugs indicating a piston failure which would require <b>an</b> <b>engine</b> re-build or replacement. The competition rules did not allow <b>an</b> <b>engine</b> change, but due to the foresight of Ernest Hives, several Rolls-Royce engineers and mechanics that were familiar with the R had travelled down to Southampton to witness the trials, and with their assistance one cylinder bank was removed, the damaged piston replaced and the cylinder refurbished. This work was completed overnight and allowed the team to continue in the competition.|$|E

5|$|Research is {{important}} in 4X games because technological progress is <b>an</b> <b>engine</b> for conquest. Battles are often won by superior military technology or greater numbers, with battle tactics playing a smaller part. In contrast, military upgrades in non-4X games are sometimes small enough that technologically basic units remain important throughout the game.|$|E

5|$|The first F-22 crash {{occurred}} during takeoff at Nellis AFB on 20 December 2004, {{in which the}} pilot ejected safely before impact. The investigation revealed that a brief interruption in power during <b>an</b> <b>engine</b> shutdown prior to flight caused a flight-control system malfunction; consequently the aircraft design was corrected to avoid the problem. Following a brief grounding, F-22 operations resumed after a review.|$|E
