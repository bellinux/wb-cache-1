5|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{is useful for}} staging OCD lesions, evaluating {{the integrity of the}} joint surface, and distinguishing normal variants of bone formation from OCD by showing bone and cartilage edema {{in the area of the}} irregularity. MRI provides information regarding features of the articular cartilage and bone under the cartilage, including edema, fractures, fluid interfaces, articular surface integrity, and fragment displacement. A low T1 and high T2 signal at the fragment interface is seen in active lesions. This indicates an unstable lesion or recent microfractures. While MRI and <b>arthroscopy</b> have a close correlation, X-ray films tend to be less inductive of similar MRI results.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To provide {{training}} {{guidance on}} procedure numbers by assessing how {{the number of}} previously performed arthroscopic procedures relate to both competent and expert performance in simulated arthroscopic shoulder tasks. METHODS: A cross-sectional study that assessed simulated shoulder arthroscopic performance was undertaken. A total of 45 participants of varying experience performed 2 validated tasks: a simple diagnostic task and a more complex Bankart labral repair task. All participants provided logbook numbers for previously performed <b>arthroscopies.</b> Performance was assessed with the Global Rating Scale and motion analysis. Receiver operating characteristic curve {{analyses were conducted to}} identify optimum cut points for task proficiency at both "competent" and "expert" levels. RESULTS: Increasing surgical experience resulted in significantly better performance for both tasks as assessed by Global Rating Scale or motion analysis (P <. 0001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses demonstrated 52 previous <b>arthroscopies</b> were needed to perform to a competent level at the diagnostic task and 248 to be competent at the complex task. To perform at an expert level, 290 and 476 previous <b>arthroscopies,</b> respectively, were needed. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides quantified guidance for arthroscopic training and highlights the positive relationship between arthroscopic case load and arthroscopic competency. We have estimated that the number of <b>arthroscopies</b> required to achieve competency in a basic arthroscopic task exceed those recommended in some countries. These estimates provide useful guidance to those responsible for training program. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The numbers to achieve competent arthroscopic performance in the assessed simulated tasks exceed what is recommended and what is possible during surgical training programs in some countries...|$|R

However, it is unclear if these simulators allow training for their intended purposes and whether the perception of usefulness relates to level of experience.

Methods We evaluated two commercially available virtual reality simulators (Simulators A and B) and recruited 11 and nine novices (no <b>arthroscopies),</b> four and four intermediates (one to 59 <b>arthroscopies),</b> and seven and nine experts ([60 <b>arthroscopies)</b> to test the devices.

25|$|The {{advantage}} over traditional open surgery {{is that the}} joint {{does not have to}} be opened up fully. For knee <b>arthroscopy</b> only two small incisions are made, one for the arthroscope and one for the surgical instruments to be used in the knee cavity. This reduces recovery time and may increase the rate of success due to less trauma to the connective tissue. It is has gained popularity due to evidence of faster recovery times with less scarring, because of the smaller incisions. Irrigation fluid (most commonly 'normal' saline) is used to distend the joint and make a surgical space.|$|E

The recorded <b>arthroscopies</b> were analyzed for the presence of bleeding episodes with a special computer program that automatically detects the tinctures of red-colored blood. A least 20 % of an arthroscopic image had to be covered with blood to qualify as bleeding episode. The median (min-max) presence of bleeding episodes {{as a percentage of the}} operation time was 6. 6 % (0. 0 - 43. 6 %) for gravity infusion, 3. 7 % (0. 2 - 46. 4 %) for the single roller, and 3. 3 % (0. 0 - 19. 3 %) for the double roller pump, respectively. The large variation could be attributed to the occurrence of arterial bleeding episodes during some procedures. No significant differences were found between the irrigation systems. For a subgroup including acromioplasties and releases, significant differences were found in favor of both roller pumps (P < 0. 05). Overall, the roller pumps did not outperform gravity infusion. However, from the results, high-risk procedures for bleeding episodes were identified (acromioplasty and release of a frozen shoulder) that can benefit from the use of roller pumps.
