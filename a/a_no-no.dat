40|$|Results from {{peroxy radical}} {{measurements}} taken at two marine boundary layer sites (Mace Head and Weybourne) in 2002 are discussed. Previous peroxy radical measurements at Mace Head, Cape Grim and Weybourne are {{compared to the}} recent data to provide a broader picture of the oxidative capacity of the marine boundary layer. A seasonal comparison between summer and winter peroxy radical measurement at Weybourne reveals a peroxy radical diurnal cycle with a maximum at midday in summer, and a diurnal cycle with maxima during the night in winter. Winter peroxy radical levels were often as high as those during the day in summer. Care must be taken when calculating ozone-production values from peroxy radical data in winter, owing to the non-attainment of <b>an</b> <b>NO-NO</b> 2 photostationary state. In winter, this could lead to an exaggeration in the calculation of ozone production. However, when the photostationary state was achieved, winter ozone production levels were often as high as in summer. Peroxy radical measurements at the NAMBLEX campaign at Mace Head provide insights into the photochemistry of the marine boundary layer, and a detailed picture {{of the effect of}} NOx and VOCs on peroxy radical and ozone production. Peroxy radicals were found to be linearly dependent on NOx, as well as VOC loading. Night-time peroxy radical formation was driven by a mixture of ozone-alkene and NO 3 -alkene reactions, with a strong dependence on NO 3 when high NOx levels reach the site. Mace Head was seen to have a greater peroxy radical sensitivity to NOx and, subsequently, NOx influences ozone production more than at other marine boundary layer sites, leading to high ozone levels at the site during high NOx episodes. ...|$|R

5000|$|In baseball, {{a no-hitter}} (also {{known as a}} no-hit game and colloquially as <b>a</b> <b>no-no)</b> is {{a game in which}} a team was not able to record a single hit. Major League Baseball (MLB) officially defines a no-hitter as a {{completed}} game in which a team that batted in at least nine innings recorded no hits.

This is a rare accomplishment for a pitcher or pitching staff: only 296 have been thrown in Major League Baseball history since 1876, an average of about two per year. In most cases in MLB, no-hitters are recorded by a single pitcher who throws a complete game; one thrown by two or more pitchers is a combined no-hitter. The most recent no-hitter by a single pitcher was thrown on June 3, 2017 by Edinson Vólquez of the Miami Marlins against the Arizona Diamondbacks at Miami's Marlins Park. The most recent combined no-hitter was thrown by Cole Hamels, Jake Diekman, Ken Giles, and Jonathan Papelbon of the Philadelphia Phillies against the Atlanta Braves on September 1, 2014.|$|E
