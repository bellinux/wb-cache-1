50|$|Three {{variants}} of Mebroot have been discovered. It was {{estimated that the}} first version was compiled in November 2007. In December, Mebroot started drive-by downloads. In early 2008, a second wave of attacks arrived. In February 2008 a second variant was discovered which {{is accompanied by a}} modified installer. In March 2008 a third variant was discovered, in which attacks became more widespread. Since the third variant, the Trojan has been upgraded to try and outwit antivirus software. It is unknown if Mebroot is still in the wild. Mebroot is currently known to be distributed by visiting malicious websites, or by way of <b>a</b> <b>application</b> exploit. It is estimated that over 1,500 websites have been compromised, mostly in the European region. Traffic to websites infected with Mebroot can reach 50,000 to 100,000 views per day.|$|E
