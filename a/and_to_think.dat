5|$|<b>And</b> <b>to</b> <b>Think</b> That I Saw It on Mulberry Street is Theodor Seuss Geisel's first children's book. It was {{published}} under the pen name Dr. Seuss. First published by Vanguard Press in 1937, the story follows {{a boy named}} Marco, who describes a parade of imaginary people and vehicles traveling along a road, Mulberry Street, in an elaborate fantasy story he dreams up to tell his father {{at the end of}} his walk. However, when he arrives home he decides instead to tell his father what he actually saw—a simple horse and wagon.|$|E

25|$|Schoenstatt {{emphasizes}} {{a strong}} {{devotion to the}} Blessed Virgin Mary, upholding her as {{a perfect example of}} love and purity. Schoenstatt seeks to invite the Blessed Mother (and hence her divine Son, Jesus Christ) into the home by establishing a spiritual Covenant of Love with her. It encourages its members to have the faith and purity of children, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of Mary as their mother.|$|E
25|$|The Australian Shepherd has a {{reputation}} as a highly intelligent and versatile stock dog with a range of working styles. A good working Aussie is quick, thoughtful, and easy with its stock. The ability for the breed to adapt to the situation <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> for itself makes it an excellent all-around worker. For this reason, the Aussie is often chosen to work unusual livestock such as ducks, geese, and commercially raised rabbits.|$|E
25|$|Geisel's {{earliest}} elephants {{were for}} advertising and had somewhat wrinkly ears, much as real elephants do. With <b>And</b> <b>to</b> <b>Think</b> That I Saw It on Mulberry Street! (1937) and Horton Hatches the Egg (1940), the ears became more stylized, somewhat like angel wings and thus {{appropriate to the}} saintly Horton. During World War II, the elephant image appeared as an emblem for India in four editorial cartoons. Horton and similar elephants appear frequently in the postwar children's books.|$|E

While managing the feelings, the counselor must allow the client(s) to express his or her story, and explore feelings and emotions through active listening and validation. Eventually, the counselor will have to work carefully to respond to the client using challenging responses in order to help him or her work past maladaptive beliefs and thoughts, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about other options.|$|E
25|$|In 1543 the {{internal}} dissensions of the Protestant league compelled Philip {{to resign from}} its leadership <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> seriously of dissolving it. He put his trust entirely in the Emperor's good faith, agreeing to help him against both the French and the Turks. At the Diet of Speyer in 1544 he championed the Emperor's policy with great eloquence. The bishop of Augsburg declared he must be inspired by the Holy Spirit, and Emperor Charles V now intended to make him commander-in-chief in the next war against the Turks.|$|E
25|$|Geisel {{was born}} and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, the son of Henrietta (née Seuss) and Theodor Robert Geisel. All four of his {{grandparents}} were German immigrants. His father managed the family brewery and was later appointed to supervise Springfield's public park system by Mayor John A. Denison after the brewery closed because of Prohibition. Mulberry Street in Springfield, made famous in Dr. Seuss' first children's book <b>And</b> <b>to</b> <b>Think</b> That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, is less than a mile southwest of his boyhood home on Fairfield Street. Geisel was raised a Lutheran. He enrolled at Springfield Central High School in 1917 and graduated in 1921. He took an art class as a freshman and later became manager of the school soccer team.|$|E

25|$|In 1936, {{the couple}} were {{returning}} from an ocean voyage to Europe when {{the rhythm of the}} ship's engines inspired the poem that became his first book: <b>And</b> <b>to</b> <b>Think</b> That I Saw It on Mulberry Street. Based on Geisel's varied accounts, the book was rejected by between 20 and 43 publishers. According to Geisel, he was walking home to burn the manuscript when a chance encounter with an old Dartmouth classmate led to its publication by Vanguard Press. Geisel wrote four more books before the US entered World War II. This included The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins in 1938, as well as The King's Stilts and The Seven Lady Godivas in 1939, all of which were in prose, atypically for him. This was followed by Horton Hatches the Egg in 1940, in which Geisel returned to the use of poetry.|$|E
25|$|Hawley began {{teaching}} at the University of Arizona in 1929. By 1933, the University of Arizona was faced with financial difficulties due to the Great Depression, and they asked most of the young faculty to take a year’s leave of absence, which included Hawley. In the fall of 1934, she took a job {{teaching at the}} University of New Mexico in the Department of Anthropology where she made less than the male professors. As a professor Hawley was not considered easy; she expected her students to learn <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> on their own. She taught over 20 courses, several of which were usually taught by men. She was found at one point to be teaching more courses {{than anyone else in}} the anthropology department. Hawley always brought new theoretical approaches as well as her own ideas into focus while teaching. Her students knew they were expected to organize and comprehend data, in addition to become familiar with the bibliographical material. She continued to work and to teach students in the field after her retirement.|$|E
500|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} {{has been}} described as the mental ability to switch between thinking about two different concepts, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about multiple concepts simultaneously. [...] Cognitive flexibility is usually described as one of the executive functions.

500|$|The {{idea for}} Augusta National {{originated}} with Bobby Jones, {{who wanted to}} build a golf course after his retirement from the game. He sought advice from Clifford Roberts, who later became the chairman of the club. They came across a piece of land in Augusta, Georgia, of which Jones said: [...] "Perfect! [...] <b>And</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> this ground has been lying here all these years waiting for someone to come along and lay a golf course upon it." ...|$|E
500|$|They were {{accompanied}} by a teacher Pound had met in hospital, Marcella Spann, 40 years his junior, ostensibly acting as his secretary and collecting poems for an anthology. The four women soon fell out, vying for control over him; Canto CXIII: alluded to it: [...] "Pride, jealousy and possessiveness / 3 pains of hell." [...] Pound {{was in love with}} Spann, seeing in her his last chance for love and youth. He wrote about her in Canto CXIII: [...] "The long flank, the firm breast / and to know beauty and death and despair / <b>And</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that what has been shall be, / flowing, ever unstill." [...] Dorothy had usually ignored his affairs, but she used her legal power over his royalties to make sure Spann was seen off, sent back to America.|$|E

500|$|According to Judith and Neil Morgan, Geisel {{conceived}} {{the core of}} Mulberry Street {{in the summer of}} 1936 aboard the MS Kungsholm, a Swedish American luxury liner, during the return trip from a European vacation with his wife, Helen Palmer. As the Kungsholm endured a storm and Geisel suffered from sea sickness, he jotted down a rambling plot that started with [...] "a stupid horse and wagon". To keep himself occupied, he began reciting poetry to the rhythm of the ship's engines and soon found himself saying, [...] "And that is a story that no one can beat, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that I saw it on Mulberry Street." [...] For days after they landed, he had the rhythm of the ship's engine stuck in his head, so, at Helen's suggestion, he decided to write a story based around it.|$|E
500|$|Under Burton's direction, Broyles wrote another draft, but his {{script was}} {{projected}} at a $200 million budget. Fox {{wanted to cut}} it to $100 million. In August 2000, two months before principal photography, Fox brought Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal for rewrites. Broyles [...] "had {{a lot of respect}} with the work they [...] did. <b>And</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that given what I'd done and given what Tim wanted, they navigated the right course." [...] One of the considered endings had Leo Davidson crash-landing at Yankee Stadium, witnessing apes playing baseball. Various alternatives were considered before the filmmakers decided on the final one. The production of Planet of the Apes was a difficult experience for Burton. This was largely contributed by Fox's adamant release date (July 2001), which meant that everything from pre-production to editing and visual effects work was rushed.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, {{developmental}} psychologist Maryanne Wolf took up {{the cause}} of defending reading and print culture in her book , approaching the subject matter from a scientific angle in contrast to Birkerts' cultural-historical angle. A few reviewers were critical of Wolf for only touching upon the Internet's potential impact on reading in her book; however, in essays published concurrent with the book's release she elaborated upon her worries. In an essay in The Boston Globe, Wolf expressed her grave concern {{that the development of}} knowledge in children who are heavy users of the Internet could produce mere [...] "decoders of information who have neither the time nor the motivation to think beneath or beyond their googled universes", and cautioned that the web's [...] "immediacy and volume of information {{should not be confused with}} true knowledge". In an essay published by Powell's Books, Wolf contended that some of the reading brain's strengths could be lost in future generations [...] "if children are not taught first to read, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> deeply about their reading, and only then to e-read". Preferring to maintain an academic perspective, Wolf firmly asserted that her speculations have not yet been scientifically verified but deserved serious study.|$|E
