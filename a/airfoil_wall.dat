Generally, {{improvements in the}} method of determining the hot gas flow through the turbine passage is one area of concern, as is the cooling air flow inside the airfoil, and the methods of predicting the heat transfer rates on the hot gas side and on the coolant side of the airfoil. More specific areas of research are: (1) local hot gas recovery temperatures along the airfoil surfaces; (2) local <b>airfoil</b> <b>wall</b> temperature; (3) local hot gas side heat transfer coefficients on the airfoil surfaces; (4) local coolant side heat transfer coefficients inside the airfoils; (5) local hot gas flow velocities and secondary flows at real engine conditions; and (6) local delta strain range of the airfoil walls...|$|E
40|$|Two {{methods were}} used to {{calculate}} the heat flux to full-coverage film cooled airfoils and, subsequently, the <b>airfoil</b> <b>wall</b> temperatures. The calculated wall temperatures were compared to measured temperatures obtained in the Hot Section Facility operating at real engine conditions. Gas temperatures and pressures up to 1900 K and 18 atm with a Reynolds number up to 1. 9 million were investigated. Heat flux was calculated by the convective heat transfer coefficient adiabatic wall method and by the superposition method which incorporates the film injection effects in the heat transfer coefficient. The results of the comparison indicate the first method can predict the experimental data reasonably well. However, superposition overpredicted the heat flux to the airfoil without a significant modification of the turbulent Prandtl number. The results suggest that additional research is required to model the physics of full-coverage film cooling where there is significant temperature/density differences between the gas and the coolant...|$|E
40|$|In this research, a {{new method}} called elastic surface {{algorithm}} is presented for inverse design of 2 -D airfoil in a viscous flow regime. In this method as an iterative one, <b>airfoil</b> <b>walls</b> are considered as flexible curved beams. The {{difference between the}} target and the current pressure distribution causes the flexible beams to deflect at each shape modification step. In modification shape algorithm, the finite element equations of two-node Timoshenko beam are solved to calculate the deflection of the beams. In order to validate the proposed method, various airfoils in subsonic and transonic regimes are studied, which show the robustness of the method in the viscous flow regime with separation and normal shock.

40|$|A zonal {{model for}} {{aerodynamic}} analysis of two-dimensional transonic circulation control airfoils has been developed. The present approach combines a transonic full potential method {{for the global}} flow field and an integral boundary layer method for regions of the <b>airfoil</b> excluding the <b>wall</b> jet with a parabolized Navier-Stokes code for resolving the wall jet region beyond the slot. Existing methods suffer from two deficiencies: the insensitivity of the calculation to small changes in the Coanda surface geometry; and the inability to predict the shock structure of the underexpanded supersonic wall jets. The present wall jet procedure involves a pressure-split approach in the streamwise sense to enable noniterative solution of the coupled continuity and normal momentum equations for increased surface sensitivity and allows for expansion of applications to sonic slot exit conditions. Encouraging results are obtained in comparison with experimental data for two circulation <b>airfoils</b> with subsonic <b>wall</b> jets...|$|R
40|$|Gas {{turbines}} play a {{vital role}} in the today’s industrialized society, and as the demands for power increase, the power output and thermal efficiency of gas turbines must also increase. Modern high-speed aero-engines operate at elevated temperatures about 2000 K to achieve better cycle efficiencies. However, the presently available alloys cannot resist temperatures much higher than 1350 K. Internal cooling techniques for gas turbine blades have been studied for several decades. The internal cooling techniques of the gas turbine blade includes: jet impingement, rib turbulated cooling, and pin-fin cooling which have been developed to maintain the metal temperature of turbine vane and blades within acceptable limits in this harsh environment. The designers need detailed hot gas path heat transfer and temperature distributions along with the detailed flow and heat transfer data to understand the flow physics and to improve the current internal cooling designs. Gas turbine blades are cooled internally by passing the coolant through several artificially roughened serpentine passages to remove heat conducted from the outside surface. The cooling passages located in the middle of the airfoils are often lined with rib turbulators. Near the leading edge of the blade, jet impingement (coupled with film cooling) is commonly used. Pin-fins and dimples can be used in the trailing edge portion of the blades. These techniques have also been combined to further increase the heat transfer from the <b>airfoil</b> <b>walls.</b> For internal cooling, focus is now placed on the effect of rotation o...|$|R
40|$|Experiments to {{determine}} the available increase in turbine horsepower achieved by increasing turbine inlet temperature over a range of 1800 to 2600 R, while applying current gas turbine airfoil cling technology are discussed. Four cases of rocket turbine operating conditions were investigated. Two of the cases used O 2 /H 2 propellant, one with a fuel flowrate of 160 pps, the other 80 pps. Two cases used O 2 /CH 4 propellant, each having different fuel flowrates, pressure ratios, and inlet pressures. Film cooling {{was found to be}} the required scheme for these rocket turbine applications because of the high heat flux environments. Conventional convective or impingement cooling, used in jet engines, is inadequate in a rocket turbine environment because of the resulting high temperature gradients in the <b>airfoil</b> <b>wall,</b> causing high strains and low cyclic life. The hydrogen-rich turbine environment experienced a loss, or no gain, in delivered horsepower as turbine inlet temperature was increased at constant airfoil life. The effects of film cooling with regard to reduced flow available for turbine work, dilution of mainstream gas temperature and cooling reentry losses, offset the relatively low specific work capability of hydrogen when increasing turbine inlet temperature over the 1800 to 2600 R range. However, the methane-rich environment experienced an increase in delivered horsepower as turbine inlet temperature was increased at constant airfoil life. The results of a materials survey and heat transfer and durability analysis are discussed...|$|E

The design and testing of such a slotted wall is described.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. The prediction of the aerodynantic drag coefficient of airfoils is essential {{in the design of}} wings and blades of wind turbines. The evaluation of the drag coefficient of a NACA 0012 airfoil at zero degrees angle of attack relies on the Finite Volumes Method adopted by the commercial software Star­-CD, being the RANS equations solved at selected Reynolds numbers. The discrete domain consists of polyhedral cells, which minimizes the number of faces per unit volume as compared to hexahedral and tetrahedral meshes. The present work investigates the steady state regime for selected Reynolds numbers, comparing the results to the experimental ones available in literature. The airflow is incompressible over the <b>airfoil's</b> adiabatic <b>walls</b> where the non-slip condition is enforced. The molecular viscosity is constant and the turbulence model adopted is the k- mega/SST/Low Reynolds with hybrid wall function. The calculation of the flow field runs the SIMPLE algorithm. The differencing schemes are LUD for momenta, UD for kinetic turbulent. Constructive aspects of the polyhedral mesh that influences the computational effort, the choice of the turbulence model and the number of wall cells required to achieve acceptable values for y+ and cd are presented and discussed. ej 201...|$|R

40|$|The {{supercritical}} flows at high subsonic speeds over a NACA 0012 airfoil {{were studied}} to acquire aerodynamic data suitable for evaluating numerical-flow codes.

For comparison, measurements have also been taken with a semi-infinite or two- dimensional airfoil and a half-span airfoil with tip flow but no boundary layer impingement.

40|$|The {{ability of}} outer-layer devices to reduce wall shear stress over a {{substantial}} streamwise distance in rough-wall turbulent boundary layers {{has been studied}} experimentally. The devices examined are a pair of thin flat ribbons placed in tandem {{as well as those}} having symmetric <b>airfoil</b> sections. The <b>wall</b> conditions examined are smooth, d- and k-type transverse-groove and sandgrain roughnesses. The wall drag is found to be reduced from the respective normal levels in all rough walls. All k-type rough walls exhibit a similar level of relative wall drag reduction which is also smaller than that in a smooth-wall. The d-type rough walls exhibit a transitional behaviour - the relative wall drag reduction drops from the smooth wall level to that of the k-type roughness with increasing roughness Reynolds number. However, the absolute reductions in the local wall shear stress are similar in both the rough and smooth walls. On the other hand, the relative reductions are lower in the rough walls because of a higher reference drag which is caused by the unique presence of a pressure component on which the devices are not as effective...|$|R
40|$|Anticipating the {{implementation}} of advanced SiC/SiC composites into internally cooled airfoil components within the turbine section of future aero-propulsion engines, the primary objective {{of this study was}} to develop physics-based analytical and finite-element modeling tools to predict the effects of composite creep and stress relaxation at the airfoil leading edges, which will generally experience large thermal gradients at high temperatures. A second objective was to examine how some advanced NASA-developed SiC/SiC systems coated with typical EBC materials would behave as leading edge materials in terms of long-term steady-state operating temperatures. Because of the complexities introduced by mechanical stresses inherent in internally cooled airfoils, a simple cylindrical thin-walled tube model subjected to thermal stresses only is employed for the leading edge, thereby obtaining a best-case scenario for the material behavior. In addition, the SiC/SiC composite materials are assumed to behave as isotropic materials with temperature-dependent viscoelastic creep behavior as measured in-plane on thin-walled panels. Key findings include: (1) without mechanical stresses and for typical airfoil geometries, as heat flux is increased through the leading edge, life-limiting tensile crack formation will occur first in the hoop direction on the inside wall of the leading edge; (2) thermal gradients through all current SiC/SiC systems should be kept below approx. 300 F at high temperatures to avoid this cracking; (3) at temperatures near the maximum operating temperatures of advanced SiC/SiC systems, thermal stresses induced by the thermal gradients will beneficially relax with time due to creep; (4) although stress relaxation occurs, the maximum gradient should still not exceed 300 oF because of residual tensile stress buildup on the <b>airfoil</b> outer <b>wall</b> during cool-down; and (5) without film cooling and mechanical stresses, the NASA-developed N 26 SiC/SiC system with thru-thickness Sylramic-iBN fiber reinforcement and a typical EBC coating has the potential of offering a maximum long-term steady-state operating temperature of approx. 3100 F at the surface of the EBC...|$|R
40|$|A novel plasma {{circulation}} {{control technique}} is proposed {{to overcome the}} disadvantage of conventional jet circulation control about the requirement for air source. By employing the plasma actuator on {{the trailing edge of}} the <b>airfoil,</b> the plasma-induced <b>wall</b> jet is tangential to the airfoil surface and served as Coanda blowing jet, which makes the trailing-edge detachment point migrate to the lower surface of the airfoil. In this way, the circulation and the lift of airfoil are directly controlled by the plasma actuator. The effectiveness of plasma circulation control on the aerodynamic characteristics improvement of NCCR 1510 - 7067 N airfoil is demonstrated by solving the Reynoldsaveraged Navier–Stokes equations. The plasma actuator is modeled with a phenomenological model by adding the body force source terms to the governing equations. The results indicate that the efficiency of plasma circulation control for lift augmentation is superior to that of conventional jet circulation control method. The lift augmentation efficiency after the location optimization reaches CL=C 134 : 86, which is much higher than the maximum lift augmentation efficiency 80 for conventional jet circulation control. The optimal location for the plasma actuator in plasma circulation control is downstream of the boundary-layer separation point with proper distance, where the plasma actuator makes the separated shear layer reattach to the airfoil surface and delays the trailing-edge stagnation by Coanda effect.

40|$|Wake-airfoil {{interaction}} {{noise is}} a concern for many applications such as contra-rotating open rotors, aeroengine rotor-stator interaction and high density wind-farms. In this study we propose a measurement procedure, based on the implementation of low-cost electret microphones flush-mounted {{on the surface of}} an airfoil subjected to incoming rotating wakes. This methodology is applied on the characterization of the chord-wise distribution of unsteady pressure jump. This paper demonstrates that the electret microphones can provide high measurement repeatability on a broad range of frequencies and that they can be applied to engineering measurements. The electrets are applied to a rotor-wake- airfoil interaction case, where aerodynamic quantities, e. g. wall-pressure fluctuation and propagation velocity are compared with results from linearized airfoil theory. It is shown that he correct electrets phase calibration allows the computation of the perturbation propagation velocity along the airfoil chord. Correlation levels between the wall pressure jump and the far-field noise are established for different frequencies and regions of the <b>airfoil.</b> The measured <b>wall</b> pressure fluctuations were used as input for Curle’s analogy for far-field noise prediction, and the results were compared with measurements, showing good agreement. Finally, the upstream wake flow velocity was measured by means of hot-wire anemometry and the resulting space-averaged incoming flow velocity fluctuation were used as input for an unsteady panel code. In this case, the predicted wall pressure fluctuation and the far-field noise are compared showing both also good agreement. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering. Aircraft {{in-flight}} icing {{is a major}} {{safety issue}} for civil aviation, having already caused hundreds of accidents and incidents related to aerodynamic degradation due to post takeoff ice accretion. Airplane makers have to protect the airframe critical surfaces against ice build up {{in order to ensure}} continued safe flight. Ice protection is typically performed by mechanical, chemical, or thermal systems. One of the most traditional and still used techniques is the one known as hot-air anti-icing, which heats the interior of the affected surfaces with an array of small hot-air jets generated by a piccolo tube. In some cases, the thermal energy provided by hot-air ice protection systems is high enough to fully evaporate the impinging supercooled droplets (fully evaporative systems), while in other cases, it is only sufficient to maintain most of the protected region free of ice (running wet systems). In the latter case, runback ice formations are often observed downstream of the wing leading edge depending on hot-air, icing, and flight conditions. The design process of hot-air anti-icing systems is traditionally based on icing wind tunnel experiments, which can be very costly. The experimental effort can be significantly reduced with the use of accurate three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation tools. Nevertheless, such type of simulation requires extensive CPU time for exploring all the design variables. This thesis deals with the development of an efficient hot-air anti-icing system simulation tool that can reduce the computational time to identify the critical design parameters by at least two orders of magnitude, as compared to 3 -d CFD tools, therefore narrowing down the use of more sophisticated tools to just a small subset of the entire design space. The hot-air anti-icing simulation tool is based on a combination of available CFD software and a thermodynamic model developed in the present work. The computation of the external flow properties is performed with FLUENT (in a 2 -d domain) by assuming an isothermal condition to the <b>airfoil</b> external <b>wall.</b> The internal skin heat transfer is computed with the use of local Nusselt number correlations developed through calibrations with CFD data. The internal and external flow properties on the airfoil skin are provided as inputs to a steady state thermodynamic model, which is composed of a 2 -d heat diffusion model and a 1 -d uniform film model for the runback water flow. The performance of the numerical tool was tested against 3 -d CFD simulation and experimental data obtained for a wing equipped with a representative piccolo tube anti-icing system. The results demonstrate that the simplifications do not affect significantly the fidelity of the predictions, suggesting that the numerical tool can be used to support parametric and optimization studies during the development of hot-air anti-icing systems...|$|R
