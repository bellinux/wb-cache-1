40|$|Estimation of <b>arrival</b> <b>angles</b> and {{incoming}} signals is {{a challenging}} problem for HF channels where the signals are correlated and {{the separation between}} the signals can be as low as a couple of degrees. In this paper, a new algorithm, Multipath Separation- Direction of Arrival (MS-DOA), is developed to estimate both the <b>arrival</b> <b>angles</b> in elevation and azimuth and the incoming signals at {{the output of the}} reference antenna with very high accuracy. The MS-DOA algorithm provides reliable angle and signal estimates even with small separation of <b>arrival</b> <b>angles</b> and for low SNRs. The minimum number of antennas that are required by the algorithm is only one more than the number of incoming signals. In a narrowed down region of interest and for a few incoming signals, the computational search time for MS-DOA is only a couple of minutes in a Standard PC...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{focuses on}} the DOA (direction of arrival) {{tracking}} problem with uniform linear arrays. In the litera-ture, there are two common approaches: one is to first use MUSIC based algorithms to estimate the signal subspace and then calculate the <b>arrival</b> <b>angles</b> from it; {{the other is to}} use Kalman filtering (KF) techniques to track the angles directly. This paper emphasizes on the fast movement case and hence follows the second approach. The key feature of this work is to simultaneously update the <b>arrival</b> <b>angles</b> and the source signals in the KF step by treating the source signals {{as a function of the}} <b>arrival</b> <b>angles.</b> Hence the term Simultaneous Angle-Souce Update (SASU). On the theoretical front, we show the deep connections between SASU and the two common approaches in the literature. On the more practical side, a Newton method is developed to solve the optimization problem in the KF step...|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} composite maps of surface-wave arrival-angle anomalies using clustered {{earthquakes and}} an array method for measuring wave-front geometry. This results in observations of <b>arrival</b> <b>angles</b> covering the entire footprint of the USArray Transportable Array during 2006 – 2010. Bands of arrival-angle deviations in the propagation direction indicate the presence of heterogeneous velocity structure {{both inside and outside}} of the array. We compare the observed patterns to <b>arrival</b> <b>angles</b> predicted using two global tomographic models, the mantle model S 362 ANI and the surface-wave-dispersion model GDM 52. We use both ray-theory-based prediction methods and measurements on synthetic data calculated using a spectral-element method. Both models and all prediction methods produce similar mean <b>arrival</b> <b>angles</b> and long-wavelength patterns of anomalies which are similar to the observations. Predicted short-wavelength features generally do not agree with the observations. The spectral-element method produces some complexity that is not obtained using the ray-theory-based methods; this predicted complexity is similar in character to the observed patterns, but does not match them...|$|R
5000|$|The new {{analysis}} of Centauro I reveals {{that there is}} a difference in the <b>arrival</b> <b>angle</b> between the upper block and lower block events, so the two are not products of the same interaction.That leaves only the lower chamber data connected to the Centauro I event.In other words, the man-horse analogy becomes redundant.There is only an obvious [...] "tail", and no [...] "head".The original detector setup had gaps between neighboring blocks in the upper chamber.Linear dimensions of gaps were comparable to the geometricalsize of the event.The signal observed in the lower detector was similar to an ordinary interaction occurred at low altitude above the chamber, thus providing a natural solution:passing of a cascade of particles through a gap between the upper blocks.|$|E
40|$|Deviation of seismic {{surface waves}} from the great-circle between source and {{receiver}} {{is illustrated by}} the anomalies in the <b>arrival</b> <b>angle,</b> that is the difference between the observed backazimuth of the incident waves and the great-circle. Such <b>arrival</b> <b>angle</b> anomalies have been known for decades, but observations remain scattered. We present a systematic study of <b>arrival</b> <b>angle</b> anomalies of fundamental mode Rayleigh waves (20 – 100 s period interval) from 289 earthquakes and recorded by a broadband network LAPNET, located in northern Finland. These observations are compared with those of full waveform synthetic seismograms for the same events, calculated in a 3 -D Earth and also compared with those of seismograms obtained by ambient noise correlation. The <b>arrival</b> <b>angle</b> anomalies for individual events are complex, and have significant variations with period. On average, the mean absolute deviation decreases from ∼ 9 ° at 20 s period to ∼ 3 ° at 100 s period. The synthetic seismograms show the same evolution, albeit with somewhat smaller deviations. While the <b>arrival</b> <b>angle</b> anomalies are fairly well simulated at long periods, the deviations at short periods are very poorly modelled, demonstrating the importance of the continuous improvement of global crustal models. At 20 – 30 s period, both event data and numerical simulations have strong multipathing, and relative amplitude changes between different waves will induced differences in deviations between very closely located events. The source mechanism has only limited influence on the deviations, demonstrating that they are directly linked to propagation effects, including near-field effects in the source area. This observation is confirmed by the comparison with seismic noise correlation records, that is where the surface waves correspond to those emitted by a point source at the surface, as the two types of observations are remarkably similar in the cases where earthquakes are located close to seismic stations. This agreement additionally confirms that the noise correlations capture the complex surface wave propagation...|$|E

40|$|High {{false alarm}} rates {{are a problem}} in anti-submarine warfare in {{littoral}} waters using active broadband sonar. Automatic classification algorithms may help combat this problem by filtering out detections due to non-threatening targets. An important feature for classification purposes is knowledge of the target's depth. Using active sonar with vertical beamforming capabilities, the received signal from a target {{can be used to}} find an estimate of the target's depth given an initial guess of the target's horizontal distance from the ship, the bottom profile and the sound speed profile. The estimation is done by an optimization algorithm. The algorithm varies relevant parameters and models signals based on these parameters, comparing the modelled signals with the received signal until parameters providing an optimal fit are found. The modelling is based on using a ray tracing procedure to find eigenrays for a candidate target depth, finding vertical <b>arrival</b> <b>angles</b> and <b>arrival</b> times by use of these eigenrays, and synthesizing a signal based on the <b>arrival</b> <b>angles</b> and <b>arrival</b> times.

40|$|The meteor {{observation}} technique based on SuperDARN raw {{time series analysis}} has been upgraded. This technique extracts meteor information as biproducts and does not degrade the quality of normal SuperDARN operations. In the upgrade the radar operating system (RADOPS) has been modified {{so that it can}} oversample every 15 km during the normal operations, which have a range resolution of 45 km. As an alternative method for better range determination a frequency domain interferometry (FDI) capability was also coded in RADOPS, where the operating radio frequency can be changed every pulse sequence. Test observations were conducted using the CUTLASS Iceland East and Finland radars, where oversampling and FDI operation (two frequencies separated by 3 kHz) were simultaneously carried out. Meteor ranges obtained in both ranging techniques agreed very well. The ranges were then combined with the interferometer data to estimate meteor echo reflection heights. Although there were still some ambiguities in the <b>arrival</b> <b>angles</b> of echoes because of the rather long antenna spacing of the interferometers, the heights and <b>arrival</b> <b>angles</b> of most of meteor echoes were more accurately determined than previously.
