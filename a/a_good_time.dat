5|$|In the autumn, species {{arrive from}} the north, some, such as black-tailed godwits, curlew {{sandpipers}} and little stints just passing through, pausing {{for a few}} days to refuel, others staying for the winter. This is also <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> to see bearded reedlings. Offshore, great and Arctic skuas, northern gannets and black-legged kittiwakes may pass close by in favourable winds.|$|E
5|$|The {{thought of}} {{acting in a}} film had never even entered their minds. They're easy-going people, they have <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> {{in front of the}} camera and I don't think there was a single moment where either of them felt they were working.

5|$|Following the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantines {{were left}} in an {{unstable}} position. The capture of Constantinople in 1261 and subsequent campaigning did not come at <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> — the weakening of the Sultanate of Rum resulted in many beyliks breaking away as autonomous states, such as the Emirate founded by Osman I. Although this weakening of power gave the Empire of Nicaea a temporary free hand, it {{was nothing more than}} a small respite not capitalized as much as it could have been.|$|E
5|$|Goldfaden left Romania in 1896; soon Juvilier's was {{the only}} active Yiddish theater troupe in the country, and foreign troupes had almost entirely ceased coming to the country. Although Lateiner, Horowitz, and Shumer kept writing, and {{occasionally}} managed {{to put on a}} play, it was not <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> for Yiddish theater – or any theater – in Romania, and would only become worse as the economy continued to decline.|$|E
5|$|In a subplot, Ann (Rashida Jones) {{goes to a}} singles mixer {{where she}} is {{extremely}} uncomfortable. She runs into Donna (Retta), who at first views Ann as competition, but then offers her advice after witnessing Ann's awkward flirting. When Ann hears about Andy getting married from Leslie, she considers going home, as she and Andy dated for several years. Donna tells Ann to forget her past and enjoy herself in the present. Ann ends up having <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> at the mixer and gets several phone numbers.|$|E

Frank told Lee {{that he had not}} yet finished his own work and asked Lee to return at 6:00. Newt Lee noticed that Frank was very agitated and asked if he could sleep in the packing room, but Frank was insistent that Lee leave the building and told Lee to go out and have <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> in town before coming back.|$|E
5|$|O'Dell {{set about}} {{contacting}} local musicians from the Harrisons' rented house in Nichols Canyon, as Harrison took the long-distance calls, hoping {{more than anything}} to secure Bob Dylan's participation. Almost all of Harrison's first-choice names signed on immediately, while a day spent boating with Memphis musician Don Nix resulted in the latter agreeing to organise a group of backing singers. A local Indian astrologer had advised early August as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> in which to stage the concert, and as things transpired, the 1st of that month, a Sunday, was the only day that Madison Square Garden was available at such short notice.|$|E
5|$|According to his biographer, John M. Taylor, Seward picked <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> to absent {{himself from}} electoral politics, as the Whig Party was in turmoil. President Tyler, a former Democrat, and Senator Clay each claimed {{leadership}} of the Whig Party and, {{as the two men}} differed over such issues as whether to re-establish the Bank of the United States, party support was divided. The abolitionist movement attracted those {{who did not want to}} be part of a party led by slavery-supporting southerners. In 1844, Seward was asked to run for president by members of the Liberty Party; he declined and reluctantly supported the Whig nominee, Clay. The Kentuckian was defeated by Democrat James K. Polk. The major event of Polk's administration was the Mexican–American War; Seward did not support this, feeling that the price in blood was not worth the increase in territory, especially as southerners were promoting this acquisition to expand territory for slavery.|$|E

5|$|Capodacqua of La Repubblica {{believed}} that the route favored a rider that could defend well and put in <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> during the uphill time trial. La Stampa writer Gianni Ranieri felt the two non-uphill time trials would favor Gianni Bugno, while the up-hill time trial could {{be a place where}} Claudio Chiappucci could gain time on the field. Pedro Delgado believed the race to be tougher than the Tour de France that same year. The Cima Coppi – the highest point in altitude the race reached – was scheduled to be the Passo dello Stelvio, but the pass was scrapped from the race and the Passo Pordoi – the next highest mountain – became the new Cima Coppi.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{he invited}} Perrie {{to be his}} date after she fell off her bike while staring at him work out on a field and pouring water over his torso to cool down. He helps her up, and gives her a corsage. Toward {{the end of the}} video, they sit on a bench next to the entrance, and see their date walk in with another girl wearing the same corsage as the ones that he had given each of them. They realise that they have all been two-timed by the same guy, and are all dateless. It ends with the girls being each other's date and solemnly dancing whilst {{everyone}} else has <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time.</b> Metro writer Rebecca Lewis noted that the man in the video strongly resembled Perrie's former fiancé Zayn Malik of One Direction. She also wrote that fans had noticed that she was still wearing her engagement ring in the video, meaning that the video was filmed before they split up in August 2015.|$|E
5|$|For a subplot, Chaplin first {{considered}} a character even {{lower on the}} social scale, a black newsboy. Eventually he opted for a drunken millionaire, a character previously used in the 1921 short The Idle Class. The millionaire plot {{was based on an}} old idea Chaplin had for a short in which two millionaires pick up the Little Tramp from the city dump and show him <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> in expensive clubs before dropping him back off at the dump, so when he woke up, the Tramp would not know if it was real or a dream. This was rewritten into a millionaire who is a friend of the Tramp when drunk but does not recognize him when sober.|$|E

5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) has a {{date with}} Steven Black (Wayne Brady), Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) new {{business}} manager, whom she met in one of Tracy's after-parties. Many people around Liz make an issue of Steven being black, but Liz does not care about his race. On her date with Steven, Liz is surprised to find out certain things about him, and does not have <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time.</b> Steven believes that Liz doesn't like him because he is black, when really she does not like him as a person. She {{does not want to}} be thought of as racist, so she continues on the date. Later, Liz tries to break up with Steven and explain to him that she just does not like him as a person, not because of his race. To prove they are incompatible, she brings him as a guest to the Source Awards the following night.|$|E
5|$|Musically, Animal {{draws from}} the electropop genre, while {{incorporating}} elements of dance-pop in its production and beats. Lyrically, {{the majority of}} the album's songs are based on Kesha's past life experiences of love, heartbreak, boys, and having <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time.</b> The album received mixed reviews from music critics. Some appreciated its fun, carefree nature, while others dismissed it as juvenile and said that it seemed insincere. The album attained chart success, debuting at number one on Canadian Albums Chart, US Billboard 200 and IFPI Greece Albums Chart, while charting within the top ten in seven other countries. Animal was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of one million copies to the United States and has sold over two million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Realizing his situation, Maroboduus {{requested}} Roman aid. It {{had been}} two years since the Marcommani refused to help Roman {{against the forces of}} Arminius, and so Tiberius refused to send aid. Instead, Tiberius sent Drusus to further Roman interests at Maroboduus' expense as he knew the Marcomanni were vulnerable. During the summer of 18, Drusus received intelligence from a former captive of Maroboduus, Catualda, that Maroboduus was weak and that it was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> to attack. Hence, Drusus led a powerful force {{into the heart of the}} Marcomanni, and stormed their royal stronghold. Maroboduus fled, but was forced to seek asylum in Rome, which Tiberius granted. Later, Catualda lost a battle against the Hermunduri, and he too was granted asylum. The Senate decreed that Drusus be given an ovation for his success, which he received on his return to Rome on 28 May 20.|$|E

5|$|The final French {{operation}} in the Atlantic during the campaign {{was an attempt to}} send seven frigates and corvettes to the French West Indies in September, laden with supplies to help maintain the strength and morale of the garrisons. With Willaumez believed to be still at sea, September 1806 seemed <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> to send a squadron into the Atlantic, but in fact the force was spotted within hours of leaving Rochefort by the British blockade force under Commodore Sir Samuel Hood. Hood's force gave chase and the large ships of the line soon caught up the frigates in heavy weather. Sending four of his ships off in different directions, Soleil attempted to give them cover with his three largest vessels, but after a hard-fought battle in which Hood lost an arm, four of the French frigates were captured.|$|E
5|$|Brian {{turns down}} {{a chance to}} see Disney on Ice with Jillian, so she decides to give his ticket to Peter. After Peter and Jillian spend the entire day {{together}} and greatly enjoy each other's company, Peter convinces Jillian to either force Brian to let her move in with him or leave him. An angry Brian agrees to get an apartment with Jillian. Much to his surprise, Brian has <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> living with Jillian, but he comes to the realization {{that there is no way}} he can pay the rent by himself and he decides to allow Stewie to move in with them, who now makes money with his own paper route. When Brian does not tell Jillian that Stewie is helping with the rent, Stewie quickly gets in the way of Brian and Jillian's happiness living together. After arguing with Brian one night while he is having sex with Jillian, Stewie reveals that he is paying half the rent, prompting Brian to admit he never wanted to move in with Jillian at all. Heartbroken, Jillian leaves Brian, who blames Stewie for ruining the relationship until Stewie tells him it's himself that ruined the relationship. After many failed attempts to lift a saddened Brian's spirits, Stewie convinces Brian to try to get Jillian back. Brian goes to her apartment, only to find that she has now moved in with Mayor West. As the two go their separate ways, Brian moves back in with the Griffins, where he manages to move on with his life.|$|E
5|$|Homer, {{attempting}} {{to prove to}} himself he can have <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> without Marge, leaves Bart, Lisa and Maggie {{under the supervision of}} Lionel Hutz and goes out by himself. Finding Moe's Tavern more depressing than usual, Homer visits the hilltop where he and Marge used to come to on dates before they got married. Ironically, Marge has also taken Ruth there to finish the night, but they leave just before Homer arrives. Chief Wiggum finds Homer depressed and offers him a ride home, which Homer accepts. As Ruth and Marge are driving home, Chief Wiggum, with Homer as a passenger in his patrol car, spots Ruth's car and claims that one tail light is slightly smaller than the other. He decides to pull them over. Reluctant to stop, Ruth reveals to Marge that the car she's driving actually belongs to her ex-husband, and that she had stolen it as revenge for stiffing her on child support (although Marge points out that Ruth could've just reported him to child services). Ruth leads the police on a high-speed chase rather than turning herself in. Homer realizes it is Marge in the car, and believes she is leaving him after discovering that she can have a better time without him. Ruth successfully evades Wiggum by turning off her headlights, which leads him to believe her car is a ghost car.|$|E
