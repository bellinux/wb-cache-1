50|$|<b>Aircraft</b> <b>vectoring</b> is a {{navigation}} service provided to aircraft by air traffic control. The controller decides {{on a particular}} airfield traffic pattern for the aircraft to fly, composed of specific legs or vectors. The aircraft then follows this pattern when the controller instructs the pilot to fly specific headings at appropriate times.|$|E
50|$|Modern AEW&C {{systems can}} detect {{aircraft}} from up to 400 km away, {{well out of}} range of most surface-to-air missiles. One AEW&C aircraft flying at 9000 m can cover an area of 312000 km2. Three such aircraft in overlapping orbits can cover the whole of Central Europe. AEW&C systems communicate with friendly <b>aircraft,</b> <b>vectoring</b> fighters towards bogeys, providing data on threats and targets, help extend their sensor range and make offensive aircraft more difficult to track, since they no longer need to keep their own radar active to detect threats.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. The use of radar tracking in aircraft intercept operations introduces a random noise factor into the control system. Some techniques {{have been proposed}} for organizing and smoothing the radar data prior to insertion in the control system, however, the efficiency of these techniques in providing an optimum interpretation of radar data is suspect {{in the case of}} maneuvering targets. A simulator design using a general purpose digital computer is proposed to enable observation of the behavior of certain track smoothing mentods in a typical intercept problem. The method of <b>aircraft</b> <b>vectoring</b> control in the simulator design is discussed. The effects of angular and linear target acceleration on some tracking methods is described and illustrated. Application of sampled data theory to digital computer programming is shown in a simple filter design. Simulator was programmed by author and the USNPGS CDC 1604 computer was used to conduct testing.

50|$|A {{fixed mount}} is not {{moveable}} {{with respect to}} the vehicle. The vehicle must move in order to change direction of fire. Fixed mounts are most commonly found on aircraft, and most commonly direct the weapon forward, along the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>vector</b> of movement, so that a pilot could aim and steer at the same time. Some minor aircraft designs used different concept of fixed mounts, as found in Schräge Musik or AC-47 Spooky.|$|R
50|$|Despite its {{powerful}} radar, the Su-15, like most Soviet interceptors before the late 1980s, was {{heavily dependent on}} ground control interception (GCI), with <b>aircraft</b> <b>vectored</b> onto targets by ground radar stations. It was fitted with the Lazur-S datalink system, which transmitted instructions to the pilot to accomplish the interception. The later Su-15TM had a Vozdukh-1M datalink and SAU-58 (sistema automaticheskogo upravleniya, automatic control system) capable of carrying out completely automatic, 'hands-off' interceptions until the last moments of the interception.|$|R
50|$|Tiltrotor <b>aircraft</b> <b>vector</b> thrust via {{rotating}} turboprop engine nacelles. The mechanical {{complexities of}} this design are quite troublesome, including twisting flexible internal components and driveshaft power transfer between engines. Most current tiltrotor designs feature 2 rotors in a side-by-side configuration. If such a craft is flown {{in a way}} where it enters a vortex ring state, one of the rotors will always enter slightly before the other, causing the aircraft to perform a drastic and unplanned roll.|$|R
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the push to increase National Airspace System capacity, air traffic control displays will not only have to show the increasing number of aircraft, but also all the associated data such as airspeed and altitude. The representation of aircraft data and associated relational information, often superimposed on a map, leads to cluttered displays, which could negatively affect controller performance, especially as aircraft numbers increase. To investigate these issues further, an experiment was conducted that examined the effect of increasing data-block lines on controller performance in an <b>aircraft</b> <b>vectoring</b> task. Data-block design, the primary factor, varied in the number of lines displayed (2 - 5). In addition a data-block information priority factor was examined that addressed the frequency of information access across data-block lines. Results demonstrated that while task load, measured as an increasing number of planes under control, negatively influenced reaction times and task accuracy, the number of lines in a data block was not statistically significant. However there was a trend towards reduced performance when data-blocks exceeded more than three lines on a base layer. In addition, the data blocks that contained prioritized information across levels promoted faster reaction times, but at a cost of lower situation awareness. This research demonstrated that the design of data-blocks should consider the balance between reduction in data-block interaction time against the need to allow enough interaction time to build situation awareness.

50|$|Stalls in {{fixed-wing}} flight {{are often}} {{experienced as a}} sudden reduction in lift as the pilot increases the wing's angle of attack and exceeds its critical angle of attack (which {{may be due to}} slowing down below stall speed in level flight). A stall {{does not mean that the}} engine(s) have stopped working, or that the aircraft has stopped moving — the effect is the same even in an unpowered glider <b>aircraft.</b> <b>Vectored</b> thrust in manned and unmanned aircraft is used to surpass the stall limit, thereby giving rise to post-stall technology.|$|R

50|$|By 07:40 hours, {{visibility}} {{had improved}} and the typhoon {{had moved from}} the immediate area, and the boat approached {{a group of three}} rafts. Several attempts to shoot a line to the survivors failed, so Chief Torpedoman Jon Hentz volunteered to swim to them, towing a line. At about 08:15, the rafts holding Major Ronald Dvorak, the Electronic Warfare Officer, Lieutenant William Neely III, the copilot, and Lieutenant Kent Dodson, the navigator, were secured to the submarine.

5000|$|A {{fixed-wing}} aircraft generates forward thrust when air is pushed {{in the direction}} opposite to flight. This {{can be done in}} several ways including by the spinning blades of a propeller, or a rotating fan pushing air out from the back of a jet engine, or by ejecting hot gases from a rocket engine. [...] The forward thrust is proportional to the mass of the airstream multiplied by the difference in velocity of the airstream. Reverse thrust can be generated to aid braking after landing by reversing the pitch of variable-pitch propeller blades, or using a thrust reverser on a jet engine. Rotary wing <b>aircraft</b> and thrust <b>vectoring</b> V/STOL <b>aircraft</b> use engine thrust to support the weight of the <b>aircraft,</b> and <b>vector</b> sum of this thrust fore and aft to control forward speed.|$|R

50|$|During an out-of-plane maneuver, the attacker's nose {{no longer}} {{points at the}} defender. Instead, the {{aircraft}} is rolled until its lift vector, (an imaginary line running vertically {{from the center of}} the aircraft, perpendicular to its wings), is aligned either ahead of, directly at, or behind the defender, using roll rate instead of turn rate to set the proper pursuit curve. The <b>aircraft's</b> velocity <b>vector,</b> (an imaginary line in the direction of motion) will be pulled in the direction of the lift vector.|$|R
5000|$|A lag {{displacement}} roll, {{also called}} a [...] "lag roll", is a maneuver {{used to reduce}} the angle off tail by bringing the attacker from lead pursuit to pure, or even lag pursuit. The maneuver is performed by rolling up {{and away from the}} turn, then, when the <b>aircraft's</b> lift <b>vector</b> is aligned with the defender, pulling back on the stick, bringing the fighter back into the turn. This maneuver helps prevent an overshoot caused by the high AOT of lead pursuit, and {{can also be used to}} increase the distance between aircraft.|$|R

50|$|Grease pencils {{were also}} widely {{used during the}} mid-20th century in {{aircraft}} control centers, military radar defense system stations on land and in aircraft carriers in particular. As information came in from radar operators and radio, men would take details of <b>aircraft</b> locations, <b>vectors,</b> weapons and fuel status and other information and write it in reverse on a large, clear panel of glass, which was readable to the officers {{on the other side}} of the panel. The information would be continuously updated as the situation changed. They have largely been replaced by digital displays in the modern era.|$|R
50|$|In flight an {{aircraft}} {{can be considered}} as being acted on by four forces: lift, weight, thrust, and drag. Thrust is the force generated by the engine (whether it be a jet or a propeller driven craft) and acts along the engine's thrust vector for the purpose of overcoming drag. Lift acts perpendicular to the <b>vector</b> representing the <b>aircraft's</b> velocity relative to the atmosphere. Drag acts parallel to the <b>aircraft's</b> velocity <b>vector,</b> but in the opposite direction because drag resists motion through the air. Weight acts through the aircraft's centre of gravity, towards the center of the Earth.|$|R
50|$|The {{reason for}} the lack of opposition, either by Iraqi {{planning}} or luck, was the flight path took them directly between the control zones of the US Navy and US Air Force, causing a large delay in either of them acting on the intruding enemy aircraft. Once they were detected, an AWAC promptly cleared the airspace in front of the Iraqi <b>aircraft</b> and <b>vectored</b> two Saudi F-15s against them. This was done under the direct orders of General Schwarzkopf, who wanted to demonstrate that the ongoing war was a multi-national conflict. Up until this point, only American aircraft had shot down Iraqi aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|A lag {{displacement}} roll, or [...] "lag roll," [...] helps {{improve the}} firing {{position of the}} attacking aircraft, and helps to increase range. The attacker performs the roll during a hard, turning chase, rolling both up {{and away from the}} turn. Typically performed a little slower than a normal displacement roll, the attacker achieves the proper reduction in turn radius on, or just outside the defender's turn. Upon completing the roll, when the <b>aircraft's</b> lift <b>vector</b> points directly at the enemy, the pilot pulls back on the stick, reentering the turn with the ability to achieve a better firing position.|$|R
40|$|Aircraft {{operate in}} {{different}} modes during flight, corresponding to different flight conditions and control schemes.

Introduction This paper deals with fast mode transitions of a thrust <b>vectored</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Commercial and military aircraft operate in different modes during flight, corresponding to flight regime, controlled variables and used actuators. In a landing mode, for example, the controlled variables would be the position of the aircraft with respect to the runway. In a climbing mode the primary controlled variable is altitude. In other modes we are concerned with velocity rather than position. In high performance aircraft, it is important that mode switches occur fast. This ca [...] ...|$|R

Wiltsie refueled a helicopter during this period when the chopper approached the ship low on fuel. The Christmas cease-fire which went into effect on 25 December resulted in only photo-reconnaissance flights being run against North Vietnam; no SAR opportunities were thus presented to Wiltsie and King until 29 December, when an F-4 Phantom of VF-161 (Coral Sea) crashed 51 miles from the northern SAR station among some islands off the coast near Haiphong. King guided a helicopter to the scene and it picked up both pilots—cold but well—and returned them to their carrier, Coral Sea.|$|R
