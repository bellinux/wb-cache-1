5|$|Construction of the road, <b>already</b> <b>under</b> way by this stage, {{was then}} free to {{continue}} largely unhindered, although systematic sabotage of building sites by local people continued.

5|$|In January 1917, the Board of Admiralty {{reviewed}} the navy's aircraft carrier requirements {{and decided to}} order two ships fitted with a flying-off deck {{as well as a}} landing deck aft. The initial order had to be cancelled in April 1917 for lack of building facilities, so the Admiralty decided to convert Cavendish, <b>already</b> <b>under</b> construction, in June 1917.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, {{much of the}} {{southern}} part of the neighborhood that had previously contained warehouses and empty lots has undergone development, including the River East Center east of Columbus Drive. The River East Art Center serves as the primary retail hub apart from the Magnificent Mile. South Streeterville currently has numerous skyscrapers that are either proposed or <b>already</b> <b>under</b> construction such as a new tower at InterContinental Chicago and 500 North Lake Shore.|$|E

5|$|Much {{of eastern}} Cuba, <b>already</b> <b>under</b> storm alert, was placed under a State of Emergency {{due to the}} threat of Georges. President Castro {{emphasized}} the severity of the hurricane during a two-hour address to the nation on September23. He explained, in great detail, civil preparation maps and impacts from past hurricanes. His last note was that he would refuse any aid from the United States as they (Cuba) would not accept aid from a country that has an embargo on them.|$|E
5|$|On January 13, 1855, the Oregon Territorial Legislature {{passed a}} bill moving the seat of {{government}} from Salem to Corvallis. Governor George Law Curry and many others objected to the move, since public buildings in Salem were <b>already</b> <b>under</b> construction. Curry sent the matter to the Secretary of the Treasury in Washington, D.C., where Secretary James Guthrie declared the move invalid unless acted on by the United States Congress. Thereafter, Curry and Oregon Secretary of State Benjamin Harding moved back to Salem.|$|E

Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing {{the army and the}} nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off-year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites.|$|E
5|$|The {{alternating}} {{succession of}} {{the northern and southern}} Uí Néill to the kingship of Tara would finally break down in time of Brian Boru. It was <b>already</b> <b>under</b> strain before Flann Sinna's lifetime. Two branches of the Uí Néill—the northern Cenél Conaill and the southern Síl nÁedo Sláine— had already been excluded from the succession by the Cenél nEógain and Clann Cholmáin. Many other branches of the Uí Néill had never shared in the kingship.|$|E
5|$|The {{triangle}} was <b>already</b> <b>under</b> {{attack from}} two sides by Lieutenant General George Patton's Third Army and Lieutenant General Alexander Patch's Seventh Army. The German position soon crumbled and Hitler reluctantly sanctioned a withdrawal. The First and Seventh Armies suffered heavy losses: around 113,000 Germans casualties {{at the cost}} of 17,000 on the Allied side. Nonetheless, they had avoided encirclement and managed to conduct a skilful delaying action, evacuating the last troops to the east bank of the Rhine on 25 March 1945.|$|E

5|$|A Phoenix {{municipal}} bond election in March 2006 provided $2 {{million to the}} project, marking {{the first time the}} zoo has received public funds in its history. On 8 June 2006, then-zoo director Jeff Williamson announced a major fund-raising drive over the next 10 years to update the zoo's infrastructure and many of its aging exhibits. The zoo needs to raise $70 million to complete the project. In 2009, a shorter term goal is to raise $20 million by 2012 to pay for a number of improvements that are <b>already</b> <b>under</b> way.|$|E
5|$|After the 1919 season, {{representatives of}} four Ohio League teams—the Canton Bulldogs, the Cleveland Tigers, the Dayton Triangles, and the Akron Pros—called {{a meeting on}} August 20, 1920, to discuss the {{formation}} of a new league. At the meeting, they tentatively agreed on a salary cap and pledged not to sign college players or players <b>already</b> <b>under</b> contract with other teams. They also agreed on a name for the circuit: the American Professional Football Conference. They then invited other professional teams to a second meeting on September 17.|$|E
5|$|<b>Already</b> <b>under</b> Caliph al-Mu'tasim, senior Turkish leaders began being {{appointed}} as governors of provinces of the Caliphate {{as a form}} of appanage. Thereby they secured immediate access to the province's tax revenue for themselves and their troops, bypassing the civilian bureaucracy. The Turkish generals usually remained close to the centre of power in Samarra, sending deputies to govern in their name. Thus when al-Mu'tazz gave Bakbak charge of Egypt in 868, Bakbak in turn sent his stepson Ahmad as his lieutenant and resident governor. Ahmad ibn Tulun entered Egypt on 27 August 868, and the Egyptian capital, Fustat, on 15 September.|$|E

Geisel was asked to write a more entertaining primer by William Spaulding, whom he had met during World War II and who was then director of the education division at Houghton Mifflin. However, because Geisel was <b>already</b> <b>under</b> contract with Random House, the two publishers agreed to a deal: Houghton Mifflin published the education edition, which was sold to schools, and Random House published the trade edition, which was sold in bookstores.|$|E
5|$|In September 2015, the {{president}} of SBASE highlighted plans for 2015–2019 on the Underground at a conference with other South American mass transit operators in Brazil. One of the largest changes to be made during this period is the upgrading of signalling systems on all lines, {{with the exception of}} Line E. Lines A and B are to receive Automatic Train Operation systems, replacing their ATS and ATP systems respectively, whilst lines C, D and H are to receive Communications Based Train Control systems. The implementation of these systems was <b>already</b> <b>under</b> way on Lines C and H as of September 2015, and is due to be completed on other lines before 2019. Line D is also te receive platform screen doors along with the CBTC system.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the 300 to 500 mercenaries, Katanga had approximately 14,000 to 17,000 gendarmes in its service, of whom around 7,000 had not received military training. Through reconnaissance, the UN had learned that these forces were concentrated on defending the southern tier of the province (much of the north was <b>already</b> <b>under</b> central government control), with about 5,150 troops {{in and around the}} towns of Jadotville, Kolwezi, and Bunkeya. Another 2,000 garrisoned Élisabethville. The UN also estimated that the Katangese Air Force possessed a number of Harvards, Magisters, and de Havilland Vampires, amounting to a dozen combat aircraft, as well as some other transport aircraft and small planes. However, they believed that many Katangese aircraft were unserviceable. ONUC intelligence observed limited stockpiles of ammunition, petroleum, oil, and lubricants at a few airfields.|$|E
