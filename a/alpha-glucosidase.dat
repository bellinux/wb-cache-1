25|$|In the {{mosquito}} Anopheles stephensi Liston, trypsin activity is restricted {{entirely to the}} posterior midgut lumen. No trypsin activity occurs before the blood meal, but activity increases continuously up to 30 hours after feeding, and subsequently returns to baseline levels by 60 hours. Aminopeptidase is active in the anterior and posterior midgut regions before and after feeding. In the whole midgut, activity rises from a baseline of approximately three enzyme units (EU) per midgut {{to a maximum of}} 12 EU at 30 hours after the blood meal, subsequently falling to baseline levels by 60 hours. A similar cycle of activity occurs in the posterior midgut and posterior midgut lumen, whereas aminopeptidase in the posterior midgut epithelium decreases in activity during digestion. Aminopeptidase in the anterior midgut is maintained at a constant, low level, showing no significant variation with time after feeding. <b>Alpha-glucosidase</b> is active in anterior and posterior midguts before and at all times after feeding. In whole midgut homogenates, <b>alpha-glucosidase</b> activity increases slowly up to 18 hours after the blood meal, then rises rapidly to a maximum at 30 hours after the blood meal, whereas the subsequent decline in activity is less predictable. All posterior midgut activity is restricted to the posterior midgut lumen. Depending on the time after feeding, greater than 25% of the total midgut activity of <b>alpha-glucosidase</b> is located in the anterior midgut. After blood meal ingestion, proteases are active only in the posterior midgut. Trypsin is the major primary hydrolytic protease and is secreted into the posterior midgut lumen without activation in the posterior midgut epithelium. Aminoptidase activity is also luminal in the posterior midgut, but cellular aminopeptidases are required for peptide processing in both anterior and posterior midguts. <b>Alpha-glucosidase</b> activity is elevated in the posterior midgut after feeding in response to the blood meal, whereas activity in the anterior midgut is consistent with a nectar-processing role for this midgut region.|$|E

40|$|ER <b>alpha-glucosidases</b> I and II are {{glycosyl}} hydrolases {{that play}} a key role in eukaryotic glycoprotein folding quality control. Removal of two glucose residues from the N -glycan attached to a protein allows association with calnexin or calreticulin which enable folding through associated accessory proteins. Many enveloped viruses utilise the calnexin cycle for the correct folding of their surface glycoproteins. Inhibition of the ER <b>alpha-glucosidases</b> causes misfolding of these viral glycoproteins and reduction of virion secretion and/or infectivity. Thus, inhibition of these glucosidases is a potential broad-spectrum antiviral strategy with clinical relevance. Inhibition by certain iminosugars, a class of glycomimetics, has given rise to a clinical candidate against dengue virus. To date there are no high-resolution structures available for either of the mammalian ER <b>alpha-glucosidases.</b> Presented in this thesis is the work toward the structural and biochemical characterisation of both <b>alpha-glucosidases.</b> Large-scale production of both murine glucosidases is described along with biochemical characterisation against a number of substrates. Glucosidase I is a challenging target for biochemical and structural studies. Described is the purification and confirmation of enzymatic activity. Biophysical techniques show that it is well folded and able to bind to iminosugars. Preliminary attempts at crystallisation have resulted in poorly diffracting crystals to 5 Å. This work enables future optimisation toward an atomic resolution structure of glucosidase I. Glucosidase II plays a complex role in the kinetics of glycoprotein processing in the calnexin cycle. Production of the heterodimeric enzyme has enabled a detailed biochemical characterisation with a range of substrates and inhibitors. Structural characterisation of a large fragment of glucosidase II has enabled new insights into the details of heterodimerisation, substrate specificity, and the basis of iminosugar inhibition.

40|$|Five {{different}} approaches involving glycosylation illustrate strategies for providing therapy in different disease targets [1]. In {{the case of}} hepatitis C, an iminosugar (see Chapter 25) that inhibits an ion channel in the virus represents the conventional “target knockout ” strategy.

In the third example, the structural details of the clusters of oligosaccharides which are recognized by a neutralizing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) antibody provide a way forward to creating an immunogen. The next example involves strongly activating the cellular immune response to destroy melanoma cells by educating the system to recognize tyrosinase peptides when presented (i. e. tyrosinase is the target antigen for autologous T-cell responses in melanoma patients). The final example involves partially inhibiting, rather than ablating, a carbohydrate-processing enzyme involved in glucosphingolipid biosynthesis so as to prevent storage disorders such as Gaucher’s disease.
