40|$|The soybean cyst {{nematode}} (Heterodera glycines) has become an increasingly severe problem in soybean production areas in Brazil. The {{development and use of}} resistant cultivars is the most efficient method of minimizing losses due to this pathogen. Our objective was to test the efficiency of an <b>alternative</b> <b>method</b> for screening soybean genotypes for resistance to H. glycines in field plots. The <b>alternative</b> <b>method</b> was compared to the standard method of sowing the test genotypes in fields found to be infested during the previous crop season. In the <b>alternative</b> <b>method,</b> the test genotypes are sown in the furrow following the uprooting of 45 -day-old infected plants. The <b>alternative</b> <b>method</b> resulted in twice the cyst population and fewer escapes, and more consistent results than the standard method. The major advantage of the <b>alternative</b> <b>method</b> is that it permits screening in a more homogeneous distribution of H. glycines in the soil...|$|R

40|$|In {{the direct}} {{simulation}} Monte Carlo (DSMC) method for simulating rarefied gas flows, the velocities of simulator particles that cross a simulation boundary {{and enter the}} simulation space are typically generated using the acceptance-rejection method that samples the velocities from the theoretical velocity distribution. This paper analyses an alternative technique, where the velocities of entering particles are obtained by extending the simulation procedures to a region adjacent to the simulation space, and considering the movement of particles generated within that region during the simulation time step. The <b>alternative</b> <b>method</b> may {{be considered as a}} form of acceptance-rejection technique. The number flux obtained using the <b>alternative</b> <b>method</b> is slightly lower than the theoretical number flux, due to a depleted population of high velocities. Methods of obtaining the correct number flux are presented. The <b>alternative</b> <b>method</b> allows acceptance of all possible velocities, and represents an improvement over the acceptance-rejection method where some velocities are excluded to improve computational efficiency. For upstream boundaries in high speed flows, the <b>alternative</b> <b>method</b> is more computationally efficient than the acceptance-rejection method. However, for downstream boundaries, the <b>alternative</b> <b>method</b> is extremely inefficient. The <b>alternative</b> <b>method,</b> with the correct theoretical number flux, should therefore be used in favour of the acceptance-rejection method only for upstream boundaries in DSMC computations...|$|R

AAC services became more holistic, seeking to develop a balance of aided and unaided strategies with the goal of improving functioning in the person's daily life, and greater involvement of the family. Increasingly, individuals with acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, head injury, and locked-in syndrome, received AAC services. In addition, with the challenge to the notion of AAC prerequisites, those with severe to profound intellectual impairments began to be served. Courses on AAC were developed for professional training programs, and literature such as textbooks and guides were written to support students, clinicians and parents.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, the United States Bureau of Reclamation chief design engineer, John L. Savage, {{surveyed}} {{the area and}} drew up a dam proposal for the 'Yangtze River Project'. Some 54 Chinese engineers went to the U.S. for training. The original plans called for the dam to employ a unique method for moving ships; the ships would move into locks located at the lower and upper ends of the dam and then cranes with cables would move the ships from one lock to the next. In the case of smaller water craft, groups of craft would be lifted together for efficiency. It is not known whether this solution was considered for its water-saving performance or because the engineers thought the difference in height between the river {{above and below the}} dam too great for <b>alternative</b> <b>methods.</b> Some exploration, survey, economic study, and design work was done, but the government, {{in the midst of the}} Chinese Civil War, halted work in 1947.|$|E

Ranging from six feet (1.8m) in width to a smaller -scale for filming with the puppet characters, the replicas were unreliable and frequently crashed, but Anderson asserts that the production team successfully merged the full-sized and miniature shots {{so that it is}} difficult to distinguish which aircraft is piloted by Hughes and which is remote-controlled. The scale reconstruction of the M40 bridge was aligned with a backdrop of real trees and fields to simulate the intended setting as faithfully as possible.

5|$|Because {{of their}} larval {{development}} inside the seeds which {{are protected by}} the pods, most inventorying methods are based on population of B. rufimanus adult in the field or at emergence. Adult population density can be estimated by counts on plants at field colonization. The development semiochemical attractants trapping systems for both monitoring and pest control has received particular interest in ongoing research on the weevil. Egg density can be estimated on young developing pods (>2 cm) during the oviposition period. Eggs are however small (<1mm length), green-yellowish, therefore difficult to observe. In addition, population estimate are difficult to obtain as egg laying is spread over time until 5–10 days {{after the end of}} flowering (BBCH 77). After harvest, seed quality can be observed manually at harvest and characterized according to pest damage (healthy, with no trace of damage/containing developing larvae/trace of emerged B. rufimanus adult (a hole in the seed). <b>Alternative</b> <b>methods</b> exist to sort the seeds: sorting can be done using differences in seed density due to the presence of the developing larva or of the hole left by the emerged adult, estimation of damages seeds can be done by tomography analysis. Additionally, the end of larval and pupal diapause and therefore the emergence of B. rufimanus can be induced via a solution of NaOCl and chinosol in 7 days at 30 °C, allowing the estimation of an overall infestation rate can be assessed.|$|E
