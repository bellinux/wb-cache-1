25|$|The 5-HT2c {{receptor}} agonist Fenfluramine (market names Pondimin, Ponderax and Adifax) {{was discovered in}} 1972 {{as a result of}} research performed to identify <b>anorectic</b> compounds lacking the effects of psycho-stimulants and sympathomimetic agents (such as amphetamines). Prior to the discovery of fenfluramine, amphetamines were the primary form of <b>anorectic</b> drugs available, however the side effects made them difficult to use. Fenfluramine's <b>anorectic</b> effect is achieved through an increase in serotonin levels, imparting a sensation of fullness, which leads to a lower intake of food. Fenfluramine was sold as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, dexfenfluramine and levofenfluramine.|$|E
25|$|Sibutramine (Reductil or Meridia) is an <b>anorectic</b> or {{appetite}} suppressant, {{reducing the}} desire to eat. Sibutramine may increase blood pressure and may cause dry mouth, constipation, headache, and insomnia.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, non-selective {{serotonin}} receptor antagonists demonstrated {{a relationship between}} serotonin receptors and food intake. Later, animal studies showed that serotonin receptor agonists might act as a mediator of satiety. Serotonin has been implicated as {{a critical factor in}} the short-term regulation of food intake and in promoting loss of weight associated with hyperphagia. Studies using pharmacological and genetic tools demonstrated that the 5-HT2C receptor subtype was one of the principal mediators through which serotonin exerts its <b>anorectic</b> effects in rodents. Subsequently, these receptors became a promising pharmacotherapeutic target for further investigation for the treatment of obesity. The development of 5-HT2C receptor knockout mice in the mid-1990s was a hallmark achievement in the identification and development of serotonergic drugs for weight loss. These knockout mice were hyperphagic, which led to obesity, partial Leptin resistance, increased adipose deposition, insulin resistance, and impaired glucose tolerance. As a result of these symptoms, the researchers identified a functional role for the receptors in serotonergic regulation of food intake and body weight. Later, 5-HT2C receptors were proposed as a therapeutic target for the treatment of multiple central nervous system (CNS) disorders including: psychiatric disorders, obesity, sexual dysfunction and urinary incontinence.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} associations between diagnostic group and perception of family functioning. Forty-three female subjects (9 <b>anorectics,</b> 20 bulimics, and 14 substance abusers) were administered the Family Environment Scale. Since substance abusing subjects {{were found to}} be significantly older than the other two groups, scores on the Family Environment Scale were corrected for age using a regression procedure. Logistic regression was then used to predict group membership from scores on the Family Environment Scale. Results showed that bulimics rate their families higher on active/recreational orientation than <b>anorectics.</b> Bulimics also rate their families higher on achievement orientation than substance abusing subjects. No {{significant differences were found between}} <b>anorectics</b> and substance abusers in their perceptions of family.

Implications of these results for understanding differences between these diagnostic groups are discussed, and suggestions for further research are presented...|$|R
40|$|Every {{day there}} are growing {{difficulties}} in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, obesity {{is becoming more}} common and it is considered a public health problem reaching worldwide levels. Besides, there is the pressure of society and the media for a slim look, and all these factors have led to an overuse of <b>anorectics</b> drugs with purely aesthetic purpose, without concerns for the danger of uncontrolled use. Thus, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of use of <b>anorectics</b> among scholars of both sexes enrolled at the first period of the courses {{in the area of}} health in a private institution of higher education in the city of Montes Claros - MG. We applied 123 questionnaires containing 11 questions to Pharmacy, Medicine, Physiotherapy, Nursing and Psychology students. Of this total, 82. 9 % (n = 102) were females and 17. 1 % (n = 21) were male. There was a consumption of <b>anorectics</b> only among females of 8. 1 %, and Sibutramine and Fluoxetine are the most consumed drugs. The most common side effects were restlessness (80 %) and anxiety (70 %). Regarding the reason of use, 50 % of the students claimed to have used such drugs for aesthetics purpose, 40 % because overweight condition and 10 % for both reasons.

40|$|Background: The {{relationship}} between eating disorders and affective disorders still remains unclear. Eating disordered patients may have affective disorders and vice versa, depressed and maniac patients may experience eating problems. Aim: To compare eating symptoms, {{attitudes and behaviors}} in patients with affective disorders and normal subjects. Subjects and methods: A structured clinical interview, the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT- 40) and the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) were administered to 194 patients that fulfilled the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for eating disorders, to 45 patients with affective disorders and to 82 normal female students. Results: Patients with eating disorders ranked significantly higher on the EAT- 40 and on the EDI and its factors (p < 0. 001). Patients with affective disorders ranked between eating disordered patients and the students (p < 0. 001). Compulsive-purgative type of <b>anorectics</b> and purgative type of bulimics showed the highest scores on these measures (p < 0. 001). Restrictive type of <b>anorectics</b> scored significantly highest on EDI maturity fears item (p < 0. 001). Not significant difference was observed on the EDI ineffectiveness item, between purgative bulimics and depressive patients and between the latter and compulsive-purgative anorexics, on the EDI interpersonal distrust item. Conclusions: Compulsive-purgative type of <b>anorectics</b> and purgative type of bulimics showed the more severe psychological and behavioral disturbances. Restrictive types of <b>anorectics</b> were the most immature. Both purgative bulimics and depressive patients showed feelings of general inadequacy, and both compulsive-purgative anorexics and depressive patients displayed an interpersonal distrust.

40|$|M. Sc. Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is a {{debilitating}} psychiatric illness characterised by a morbid fear of weight gain and/or of eating, despite obvious emaciation. Poor {{understanding of the}} aetiology and pathophysiology of AN has, however, hindered the development of effective interventions. Nonetheless, over the past decade, neurocognitive endophenotypes have been increasingly researched as promissory, clinically-relevant and heritable characteristics which might predispose the development and persistence of AN, the elucidation of which might well lead to improved treatment strategies. In particular, mental inflexibility, which can be measured on set-shifting (SS) tasks, is frequently reported in subjects with AN, and is believed to reflect underlying subtle dysfunction of corticostriatal brain circuitry. This study investigated whether SS difficulties were present {{in a sample of}} South African <b>anorectics.</b> The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) was used to measure SS ability in 10 young women with current AN, and in 10 matched healthy controls (HC). This study also measured eating-related psychopathology, Body Mass Index (BMI), and depressive, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptomatologies, and obtained as well an estimate of intelligence, in case these factors might independently influence WCST performance. Contrary to prediction, <b>anorectics</b> performed significantly better on the WCST than did individuals from the HC group, making a smaller number of incorrect responses and proportionately fewer perseverative errors. Controlling statistically for the aforementioned potentially-confounding variables did not change these results. This is the first study to have shown superior SS performance in an AN group, and suggests that SS might be intact, or adequately compensated for, in younger, less-severely affected patients with a concomitantly shorter illness duration. Further studies, on larger samples of similarly-aged <b>anorectics,</b> with less severe pathology and shorter illness duration, are necessary to explore the generalizability and implications of this unexpected finding...|$|R
