500|$|All of his work, {{which has}} been called [...] "striking", shares a {{distinct}} visual style inspired by Golden Age comic artists, Russian Constructivists, Italian Futurists, and woodcut artists. In an interview with Sherwin, Hughes stated, [...] "KMFDM have cornered the market in industrial post-modern angst <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>my</b> work reflects that." [...] Hughes said that initially he based {{his work on the}} music, which caused [...] "artistic block". Konietzko gave him more freedom to use whatever themes he wished, resulting in the cover to Money, which Hughes said [...] "was based upon my disillusionment with the street lifestyle I was experiencing at the time, and the art carries with it the implication that no matter what temptation lies in your path, you still gotta pay!" ...|$|E
500|$|While Sunsoft's {{development}} team, {{headed by}} Iwata, were {{confident that they}} produced a great game, Chô Wakusei Senki Metafight did not sell well in Japan and, as a result, was not received well within Sunsoft. No sequel was originally planned due to the game's poor sales; Iwata already started development on another game when the North American release Blaster Master sold well. The game's impact led Sunsoft to develop titles with similar top-down gameplay like [...] and Fester's Quest, the latter of whose main designer had helped design the characters for Blaster Master. Iwata incorporated many of the gameplay elements in the remake , which his goal was [...] "for players to recall and think back upon (the original) Blaster Master, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>my</b> goal {{was to find a}} way to evoke that through this game." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hughes {{was accused}} of being a Communist by many on the {{political}} right, but he always denied it. When asked why he never joined the Communist Party, he wrote, [...] "it was based on strict discipline and the acceptance of directives that I, as a writer, did not wish to accept." [...] In 1953, he was called before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations led by Senator Joseph McCarthy. He stated, [...] "I never read the theoretical books of socialism or communism or the Democratic or Republican parties for that matter, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>my</b> interest in whatever may be considered political has been non-theoretical, non-sectarian, and largely emotional and born out of my own need to find some way of thinking about this whole problem of myself." [...] Following his testimony, Hughes distanced himself from Communism. He was rebuked by some on the Radical Left who had previously supported him. He moved away from overtly political poems and towards more lyric subjects. When selecting his poetry for his Selected Poems (1959) he excluded all his radical socialist verse from the 1930s.|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{questioned}} {{the portrayal of}} Jess' girlishness early on. Phillip Maciak of Slant Magazine initially expected New Girl as one of 2011's many new female-centric shows to [...] "be an exemplar of this new age of empowerment, but found instead that [...] "New Girl presents us with a narratively scattered, male fantasy of a show about a cooing woman-child in a polka-dot skirt who literally can't say the word 'penis' without giggling." [...] Meriwether stated {{it was not the}} show's goal to create a symbol and, pointing to gender double-standards, rejected opinions that Jess was emblematic of all women. She [...] "was really just writing about myself, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>my</b> main goal is just to give Zooey, really fun, interesting things to do every week, and then just be really honest with myself about the character and present an interesting, funny female character on television." [...] Critics felt the first-season episode [...] "Jess & Julia" [...] was a meta reference to Jess' girliness and the initial [...] "adorkable" [...] ad campaign for New Girl, but Meriwether stated the episode was more a response to a controversial New York magazine cover story about Deschanel's personality and her views on women's issues.|$|E
