30|$|In {{the present}} study, the <b>acetone</b> <b>extract</b> of E. golondrina at {{different}} concentrations was assessed for nitrite free radical scavenging activity in an in vitro model. The nitric oxide scavenging {{activity of the}} <b>acetone</b> <b>extract</b> of E. golondrina was {{higher than that of}} both vitamin C and Rutin. The activity of the <b>acetone</b> <b>extract</b> could be attributed to phyto-components such as phenolic compounds. Polyphenols are major antioxidant components present in most plant extracts (Ebrahimzadeh et al. 2010). The <b>acetone</b> <b>extract</b> is thought to contain polyphenols since acetone effectively penetrates cellular membranes of plants resulting in the extraction of polyphenols (Sumazian et al. 2010). Other {{studies have shown that the}} genus Euphorbia is extremely rich in polyphenolics; 9 antioxidant polyphenols: scopoletin, scoparone, isoscopoletin, quercetin, isorhamnetin, pinocembrin, kaempferol, luteolin, and gallic acid were preliminary identified from Euphorbia hirta (Wu et al. 2012). Ferulic acid is a phenolic compound that was identified from Euphorbia tirucalli (De Araújo 2014). Boudiar et al. (2010) identified six known flavonoids namely, kaempferol, kaempferol 3 -O-glucoside, kaempferol 3 -rutinoside, quercetin, quercetin 3 -O-glucoside, and rutin from the aerial parts of Euphorbia guyoniana. This suggests that E. golondrina might contain compounds that scavenge and this may account for the regulation of pathological conditions induced by nitric oxide and its oxidation product, peroxynitrite. Nitric oxide has been reported to be scavenged by flavonoids and saponins (Patel et al. 2010). Hence, the presence of phenolics and saponins compounds such as 1 -naphthalenol and alpha-glucopyranoside could partially explain why E. golondrina is more potent at quenching the nitric oxide radical. Since chronic exposure to nitric oxide radical is associated with inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, the scavenging of E. golondrina <b>acetone</b> <b>extract</b> could partially justify the folkloric use of the plant in the treatment of rheumatism.|$|E

To develop a new natural anti-in-flammatory agent for cosmetics, we investigated the inhibitory effects of inflammation in Rosa multiflora root (R. multiflora root). The biological activity and anti-inflammatory effects were investigated by wa-ter, ethanol, methanol and <b>acetone</b> <b>extracts</b> of R. multiflora root. The measurements of polyphenol con-tent from R. multiflora root were highest in water and <b>acetone</b> <b>extracts,</b> at 57. 48 ± 0. 88 mg/g and 67. 05 ± 0. 56 mg/g, respectively. The result of DPPH, ABTS and superoxide anion radical scavenging effects showed over 50 % efficacy at 50 μg/ml in ethanol, methanol and <b>acetone</b> <b>extracts.</b> Hyaluronidase in-hibition effect showed over 60 % efficacy at 500 μg/ml in ethanol, methanol, and <b>acetone</b> <b>extracts.</b> Nitric oxide radical inhibition effect of R. multiflora root ethanol extracts showed over 30 % efficacy at 500 μg/ml. We investigated the effect of R. multiflora root extracts on nitric oxide (NO) production of in-ducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in LPS-induced RAW 264. 7 macrophage cells. The result showed that R. multiflora root extracts have an inhibitory effect on NO production and iNOS expression and also can be used as an anti-inflammatory agent. These antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of R. multiflora root show applicant potential application as a functional cosmetic material...|$|R
40|$|The {{compatibility}} of Metarhizium anisopliae with Ocimum sanctum was {{studied in}} vitro. Leaves, roots, stems and seed extracts of O. sanctum were mixed in a Potato Dextrose Agar and Potato Dextrose Broth. M. anisopliae was inoculated and the mycelial dry weight and spore count were assessed. The {{behavior of the}} fungus with the extracts was similar in terms of mycelial dry weight, except for methanol extracts of leaves, ether extracts of roots, water and <b>acetone</b> <b>extracts</b> of seeds and benzene, methanol and <b>acetone</b> <b>extracts</b> of stems which reduced the mycelial dry weight of the fungal colonies. Benzene extract of leaves and methanol extract of roots of O. sanctum {{were found to be}} highly compatible with M. anisopliae whereas ether extract of roots and benzene as well as <b>acetone</b> <b>extracts</b> of stem were classified as very toxic. The results of the current study revealed that O. sanctum extracts did not affect the inoculum potential of M. anisopliae in terms of mycelial dry weight and spore count and hence M. anisopliae was compatible with O. sanctum...|$|R
40|$|Phytochemical {{constituents}} of Allium porrum leaf extracts and its antibacterial potentialities were evaluated using different solvents. Phytochemical {{screening of the}} different extracts showed that leaves contains important compounds such as amino acid with sulphate, carbohydrates, Phenols, Proteins, flavonoids, alkaloids, steroids, Tannins and saponin. Aqueous, methanol and <b>acetone</b> <b>extracts</b> of plant leaves were used for assessing antibacterial activity against Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris by agar well diffusion method. The present study demonstrated that the aqueous, methanolic, <b>acetone</b> <b>extracts</b> of A. porrum consists different phytochemical components thus exhibit variations in the antibacterial activity. These promissory extracts open the prospect of finding new clinically effective antibacterial compounds...|$|R
