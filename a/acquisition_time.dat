25|$|Typically in MRS {{a single}} {{spectrum}} is acquired by averaging enough spectra {{over a long}} <b>acquisition</b> <b>time.</b> Averaging is necessary because of the complex spectral structures and relatively low concentrations of many brain metabolites, which result in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in MRS of a living brain.|$|E
25|$|While the {{practicality}} of CBCT fosters its increasing {{application in}} IR, technical limitations hinder its {{integration into the}} field. The two most significant factors that affect successful integration are image quality and time (for set up, image acquisition, and image reconstruction). Compared to MDCT, the wider collimation in CBCT leads to increased scatter radiation and degradation of image quality as demonstrated by artifacts and decreased contrast-to-noise ratio. The temporal resolution of cesium iodide detectors in CBCT slows data <b>acquisition</b> <b>time</b> to approximately 5 to 20 seconds, which increases motion artifact. The time required for image reconstruction takes longer for CBCT (1 minute) compared to MDCT (real time) due to the computationally demanding cone beam reconstruction algorithms.|$|E
25|$|Temporal {{resolution}} of fMRI is limited by: (1) the feedback mechanism {{that raises the}} blood flow operating slowly; (2) having to wait till net magnetization recovers before sampling a slice again; and (3) having to acquire multiple slices to cover the whole brain or region of interest. Advanced techniques to improve temporal resolution address these issues. Using multiple coils speeds up <b>acquisition</b> <b>time</b> in exact proportion to the coils used. Another technique is to decide which parts of the signal matter less and drop those. This could be either those sections of the image that repeat often in a spatial map (that is small clusters dotting the image periodically) or those sections repeating infrequently (larger clusters). The first, a high-pass filter in k-space, has been proposed by Gary H. Glover and colleagues at Stanford. These mechanisms assume the researcher has {{an idea of the}} expected shape of the activation image.|$|E
30|$|Long <b>acquisition</b> <b>times</b> in routine imaging procedures, such {{as whole}} body bone scintigraphy, are a {{constant}} {{issue in the}} field of nuclear medicine. Shorter <b>acquisition</b> <b>times</b> allow for more patient examinations per imaging modality and also a decrease in discomfort of patients suffering from painful diagnoses such as bone metastases. Whole body bone scintigraphy {{is one of the most}} common nuclear medicine investigations worldwide [1], and the recent increase in complementary use of SPECT-CT imaging [2] points towards a need for reduced scan-times in the years to come. The obvious reason for not reducing the <b>acquisition</b> <b>times</b> is the associated decrease in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This effect could be compensated for by an increase in patient administered activity; however, this approach is not necessarily consistent with keeping the dose to the patient as low as reasonably achievable. Another way to address the increase in noise associated with shorter <b>acquisition</b> <b>times</b> is to apply different post-processing methods such as Pixon® image processing.|$|R

40|$|Quantitative PET studies require {{computing}} of the attenuation {{correction factors}} (ACF) for compensating the body attenuation {{effect in the}} emission data. Short <b>acquisition</b> <b>times</b> for transmission are desired, because of patient comfort and movement elimination. In practice, long <b>acquisition</b> <b>times</b> are used due to the statistical noise of count-limited scans. In {{order to reduce the}} noise, the median root prior (MRP) iterative reconstruction algorithm was used for reconstruction of short time transmission images. Using these images, the ACFs were generated for correction of emission data. The new approach allows for scan times of 2 min or less, which is desirable for quantitative whole body PET studies. The new method is object independent and robust, because no smoothing of scan data or segmentation of the image are used. I.

30|$|Breath-holding can be {{used during}} both CT and MRI to limit the effects of {{respiratory}} motion {{on the quality of}} images. CT is less affected by motion due to rapid <b>acquisition</b> <b>times.</b> MRI requires longer <b>acquisition</b> <b>times</b> to achieve adequate spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Slice thickness can be increased to improve z-axis coverage in patients with limited breath-holding capacities. However, this results in partial volume effects when the voxels at the interface of two structures with varying signal characteristics must be averaged. In addition, the large spaces between voxels must also be interpolated, increasing volumetric error.|$|R
30|$|Previous studies {{employing}} Pixon-algorithms on planar {{images have}} shown promising results with improved image quality in 99 mTc nuclear medicine images supporting shorter <b>acquisition</b> <b>times</b> or lower administered activities {{in conjunction with}} the Pixon-algorithm [3 – 6]. These studies have either applied the algorithm to existing clinical full scan-time images, to clinical images with Gaussian noise added to simulate shorter <b>acquisition</b> <b>times</b> or to phantom studies. Despite promising results, the Pixon-algorithm is not commonly employed in clinical practice [6], indicating the need for further studies employing images acquired with clinical protocols and reviewed by experienced clinical observers.|$|R
30|$|Turbo-spin echo (TSE) is an {{adequate}} sequence to minimise susceptibility artefacts and distortion, and {{it increases the}} signal-to-noise ratio. Unfortunately, it also increases <b>acquisition</b> <b>times</b> and is therefore more sensitive to motion throughout the procedure.|$|R
50|$|Acquisition Table - An indexed list of {{frequencies}} {{on which}} the device may search for particular systems. The idea behind the acquisition table is to optimize the <b>acquisition</b> <b>time</b> by identifying only the frequencies that should be searched, rather than searching the entire frequency spectrum. The information contained in each acquisition table entry includes an index, the network type, and associated channel blocks.|$|E
50|$|Strengths: The {{strength}} of micro-PET {{is that because}} the radiation source is within the animal, it has practically unlimited depth of imaging. The <b>acquisition</b> <b>time</b> is also reasonably fast, usually around minutes. Since different tissues have different rates of uptake radiolabelled molecular probes, micro-PET is also extremely sensitive to molecular details, and thus only nanograms of molecular probes are needed for imaging.|$|E
50|$|A {{common problem}} in {{fluorescence}} microscopy is photobleaching, where the fluorophore loses its activity {{as a result}} of exposure to light. This can lead to the inaccurate measurement of fluorescence intensity. Photobleaching, light source stability, and system variability are all sources of error but can be minimized if the user is able to reduce the <b>acquisition</b> <b>time</b> between samples and include the proper controls.|$|E

50|$|Originally, {{conventional}} 2D QCT used individual, thick CT slice images {{through each}} of multiple vertebrae which involved tilting the CT scanner gantry to align the slice with each vertebra. Today, modern 3D QCT uses {{the ability of}} CT scanners to rapidly acquire multiple slices to construct three-dimensional images of the human body. Using 3D imaging substantially reduced image <b>acquisition</b> <b>time,</b> improved reproducibility and enabled QCT bone density analysis of the hip.|$|E
50|$|GPS units, {{internal}} or external, require a lock {{from at least}} three satellites (for position), which usually requires up to 60 seconds. However, <b>acquisition</b> <b>time</b> is decreasing rapidly with hardware improvements. Some 21st-century GPS receivers use cell tower location and one global positioning satellite to obtain a faster lock on location. This technology known as assisted GPS (aGPS) is becoming more popular in cellular phones, since it leverages cell tower locations.|$|E
50|$|In {{this method}} of non-data-aided carrier {{recovery}} a non-linear operation {{is applied to the}} modulated signal to create harmonics of the carrier frequency with the modulation removed. The carrier harmonic is then band-pass filtered and frequency divided to recover the carrier frequency. (This may be followed by a PLL.) Multiply-filter-divide is an example of open-loop carrier recovery, which is favored in burst transactions since the <b>acquisition</b> <b>time</b> is typically shorter than for close-loop synchronizers.|$|E
