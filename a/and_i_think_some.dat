500|$|In an {{interview}} with Kerrang!, Jesse Lacey commented on the upcoming album's content, [...] "It's a pretty exhausting record. It's quite dense <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>some</b> of the decisions we made don't always go in the most obvious direction. We were thinking {{a lot more about}} what we'd want to play when we were up onstage rather than actually what you'd want to hear on a record." [...] He then questioned the future of the band, saying, [...] "I {{think a lot of the}} record is about us trying to make decisions about how long the band should go on. When I listened back to it, I realized how many songs are about something coming to a close, or knowing when it's time to put something away and move on." ...|$|E
500|$|Somewhat {{overshadowed by}} Henderson's winning goal, was a four-point game by Phil Esposito, two goals and two assists, and {{a hand in}} all three goals of the third period. Esposito was the only player on either team to score four points in a game during the series. According to Ron Ellis, he had [...] "never seen another player have a period where {{there was so much}} {{pressure}} and was still able to accomplish what he did." [...] Sinden considered it to be Esposito's [...] "finest hour." [...] Esposito describes it as [...] "there was no stopping me. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>some</b> of the guys got a little angry with me. If we had lost, I would have been the goat. But we didn't lose. I just had enough faith in myself, that I was going to get it done, one way or another." ...|$|E

Some non-Muslims said that their view on Muslims had changed.

6000|$|A curious {{little smile}} crept into Ormsgill's eyes. [...] "Well," [...] he said reflectively, [...] "there are respects in which one's {{possessions}} {{are apt to}} become burdensome. They seem to carry so many obligations along with them that one falls into bondage under them, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>some</b> of us are rebels born.

60|$|Lunch was in {{the great}} dining-room. There was a big table and two smaller ones; we sat down anyhow, but the first comers had grouped {{themselves}} about Lady Ladislaw and Evesham and Justin and Mary in a central orb, and I had to drift perforce {{to one of the}} satellites. I secured a seat whence I could get a glimpse ever and again over Justin's assiduous shoulders of a delicate profile, and I found myself immediately engaged in answering the innumerable impossible questions of Lady Viping, the widow of terrible old Sir Joshua, that devastating divorce court judge who didn't believe in divorces. His domestic confidences had I think corrupted her mind altogether. She cared for nothing but evidence. She was a rustling, incessant, sandy, peering woman with a lorgnette and rapid, confidential lisping undertones, and she wanted to know who everybody was and how they were related. This kept us turning towards the other tables--and when my information failed she would call upon Sir Godfrey Klavier, who was explaining, rather testily on account of her interruptions, to Philip Christian and a little lady in black and the elder Fawney girl just why he didn't believe Lady Ladislaw's new golf course would succeed. There were two or three other casual people at our table; one of the Roden girls, a young guardsman <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>some</b> other man whom I don't clearly remember.|$|E
6000|$|June 19th.--This forenoon we {{have been}} to the Church of St. Lorenzo, which stands on the site of an ancient basilica, and was itself built more than four centuries ago. The facade is still an ugly height of rough brickwork, {{as is the case with}} the Duomo, <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>some</b> other churches in Florence; the design of giving them an {{elaborate}} and beautiful finish having been delayed from cycle to cycle, till at length the day for spending mines of wealth on churches is gone by. The interior had a nave with a flat roof, divided from the side aisles by Corinthian pillars, and, at the farther end, a raised space around the high altar. The pavement is a mosaic of squares of black and white marble, the squares meeting one another cornerwise; the pillars, pilasters, and other architectural material is dark brown or grayish stone; and the general effect is very sombre, especially as the church is somewhat dimly lighted, and as the shrines along the aisles, and the statues, and the monuments of whatever kind, look dingy with time and neglect. The nave is thickly set with wooden seats, brown and worn. What pictures there are, in the shrines and chapels, are dark and faded. On the whole, the edifice has a shabby aspect. On each side of the high altar, elevated on four pillars of beautiful marble, is what looks like a great sarcophagus of bronze. They are, in fact, pulpits, and are ornamented with mediaeval bas-reliefs, representing scenes in the life of our Saviour. Murray says that the resting-place of the first Cosmo de' Medici, the old banker, who so managed his wealth as to get the posthumous title of [...] "father of his country," [...] and to make his posterity its reigning princes,--is in front of the high altar, marked by red and green porphyry and marble, inlaid into the pavement. We looked, but could not see it there.|$|E
500|$|Drake {{appears on}} Pink Moon {{accompanied}} {{only by his}} own carefully recorded guitar save for a single piano overdub on the title track. Wood later said: [...] "He was very determined to make this very stark, bare record. He definitely {{wanted it to be}} him more than anything. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> in <b>some</b> ways, Pink Moon is probably more like Nick is than the other two records." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Annersly nodded reassuringly. [...] "Of course, my dear," [...] she said. [...] "As you perhaps know, it is a {{good deal}} your father's fault that I am reduced to living on my friends, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> really <b>think</b> <b>some</b> of the money he is {{spending}} on the peach-houses should have come to me.

6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it was true. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{there was}} a great flood, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>some</b> people did escape, and that they saved their beasts, just as we should try to save Nigger and the Monkstown cocks and hens if we were flooded out. Then they were able to start again when the waters went down, and they were {{naturally}} very grateful to God for their escape." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{got hold}} of Kingsley, and read 'Yeast,' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>some</b> other novels of his, with great relish, and without {{sensibility}} to his Charles Readeish lapses from his art into the material of his art. But of all the minor fiction that I read at this time none impressed me so much as three books which had then already had their vogue, and which I knew somewhat from reviews. They were Paul Ferroll, 'Why Paul Ferroll Killed His Wife,' and 'Day after Day.' The first two were, of course, related to each other, {{and they were all}} three full of unwholesome force. As to their aesthetic merit I will not say anything, for I have not looked at either of the books for thirty years. I fancy, however, that their strength was rather of the tetanic than the titanic sort. They made your sympathies go with the hero, who deliberately puts his wife to death for the lie she told to break off his marriage with the woman he had loved, and who then marries this tender and gentle girl, and lives in great happiness with her till her death. Murder in the first degree is flattered by his fate up to the point of letting him die peacefully in Boston after these dealings of his in England; and altogether his story could not be commended to people with a morbid taste for bloodshed. Naturally enough the books were written by a perfectly good woman, the wife of an English clergyman, whose friends were greatly scandalized by them. As a sort of atonement she wrote 'Day after Day,' the story of a dismal and joyless orphan, who dies to the sound of angelic music, faint and farheard, filling the whole chamber. A carefuller study of the phenomenon reveals the fact that the seraphic strains are produced by the steam escaping from the hot-water bottles {{at the feet of the}} invalid.|$|E

[...] White and other younger activists took this as their rallying cry and ultimately convinced the reluctant Arizonan to run.

5000|$|Sherman {{herself has}} {{identified}} an uncertainty toward the Untitled series' {{relationship with the}} male gaze. In a 1991 interview with David Brittain in Creative Camera, Sherman said that [...] "I didn't really analyze {{it at the time}} as far as knowing that I was commenting upon some feminist issue. The theories weren't there at all... But now I can look back on some of them, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>some</b> of them are a little blatantly obvious, too much like the original pin-up pictures of those times, so I have mixed feelings about them now as a whole series." ...|$|E
5000|$|Series {{creator and}} showrunner Jenji Kohan stated that Foster {{directed}} the episode as [...] "sort of her dry-run for {{when she does}} her television thing", referencing an as-of-yet unrealized project for Showtime Foster was to spearhead. When asked about Foster's merits as a TV director, Kohan said, [...] "Movie directing is different from TV directing <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>some</b> things were like a culture shock for her because, in way, you know the director's not the king in TV. It's more collaborative with the writers than she's used to...That said? She was incredibly collaborative and really game and came in saying, 'I haven't done this before. It's a learning curve.'" ...|$|E
