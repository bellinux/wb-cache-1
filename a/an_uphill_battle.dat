5|$|In September, a poll {{conducted}} by the Goldwater campaign revealed that Johnson had a comfortable lead over him. Indeed, Goldwater's campaign was <b>an</b> <b>uphill</b> <b>battle</b> against an incumbent administration during a prosperous economy. In {{the wake of the}} death of John Kennedy, who had been leading in polls for reelection in 1964, there lingered the possibility that Johnson had the sympathy of the media and voters.|$|E
5|$|The illness-enforced layoff left Craig facing <b>an</b> <b>uphill</b> <b>battle</b> {{to regain}} {{his place in the}} {{national}} team.

5|$|Because of Plant's injuries, Led Zeppelin did not tour in 1976. Instead, {{the band}} {{completed}} the concert film The Song Remains the Same {{and the accompanying}} soundtrack album. The film premiered in New York City on 20 October 1976, but was given a lukewarm reception by critics and fans. The film was particularly unsuccessful in the UK, where, unwilling to tour since 1975 because of their tax exile status, Led Zeppelin faced <b>an</b> <b>uphill</b> <b>battle</b> to recapture the public's affection.|$|E

50|$|After <b>an</b> <b>uphill</b> ratings <b>battle</b> {{with its}} rival WAEB-FM that lasted {{over a period}} of almost 2 years, Hot 99.9 was unable to make any {{significant}} gains due to budget and signal issues. However, in its final ratings trend as a CHR, WHXT had beat WAEB-FM by two-tenths of a point.|$|R
5|$|Like Williams, Smith {{knew the}} Mad Dogs would face <b>an</b> <b>uphill</b> <b>battle</b> {{attracting}} fans once the traditional American football season started. As {{was the case}} in Birmingham, Smith persuaded the CFL to let them play their late-season home games on Sundays to avoid competing against high school and Tennessee/Ole Miss football. It was to no avail; late in the season the Mad Dogs struggled to attract more than 10,000 people. Like Williams, Smith publicly blamed community apathy and media hostility for the lackluster attendance. The team went 9–9 in their only year.|$|E
5|$|Top seed Rafael Nadal faced <b>an</b> <b>uphill</b> <b>battle</b> against Stanislas Wawrinka in {{the fourth}} round match, facing a tiebreak in each set and {{eventually}} defeating him. Second seed Roger Federer defeated Dent {{in the fourth}} round {{to set up a}} quarterfinal match with longtime rival Andy Roddick, who overcame Gaël Monfils in a two-set match. Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, Juan Martín del Potro, Verdasco and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga made it into the quarterfinals. Del Potro defeated Nadal in the three-set quarterfinal match to reach the first ATP Masters semifinal of his career. Del Potro took the final set on a tiebreak after losing the second set. Murray faced Verdasco in the second quarterfinal in a rematch of 2009 Australian Open fourth round. Verdasco suffered an injury in the second game of the match and had to be seen by his physio. He was not in good enough shape to compete with Murray and eventually lost. Federer defeated Roddick while Djokovic moved past Tsonga to advance to the semifinals. Djokovic rallied back to defeat Federer in the first semifinal after losing the first set. The third seed however kept his consistency in the next two sets and won them. Murray edged past del Potro in the second semifinal to enter his second straight Masters final. Murray faltered in the second set of the match conceding two service breaks. However he recovered in the final set, gaining an early break of serve, to win the match.|$|E

25|$|The {{race was}} covered {{nationwide}} {{as one of}} the most closely watched Senate races that year. Noted for how civil their respective campaigns were of one another, Kerry and Weld negotiated a campaign spending cap and agreed to eight separate debates leading up to the election.

But in Massachusetts, businessman Ray Shamie lost <b>a</b> close <b>uphill</b> <b>battle</b> to Lt. Gov. John Kerry for the Senate seat vacated by Paul Tsongas. Another client, Congressman Tom Corcoran, failed to dislodge incumbent Charles Percy from the Senate nomination in Illinois, despite tough ads (attributed to Finkelstein) suggesting Percy was personally close to PLO leader Yasser Arafat.|$|R
25|$|Ford's market {{presence}} in the Middle East has traditionally been small, partly due to previous Arab boycotts of companies dealing with Israel. Ford and Lincoln vehicles are currently marketed in ten countries in the region. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates are the biggest markets. Ford also established itself in Egypt in 1926 but faced <b>an</b> <b>uphill</b> <b>battle</b> during the 1950s due to the hostile nationalist business environment. Ford's distributor in Saudi Arabia announced in February 2003 that it had sold 100,000 Ford and Lincoln vehicles since commencing sales in November 1986. Half of the Ford and Lincoln vehicles sold in that country were Ford Crown Victorias. In 2004, Ford sold 30,000 units in the region, falling far short of General Motors' 88,852 units and Nissan Motors' 75,000 units.|$|E
25|$|While Ferraro's {{choice was}} popular among Democratic activists, polls {{immediately}} after the announcement showed that only 22% of women were excited about her selection, versus 18% who {{agreed that it was}} a bad idea. 60% of all voters thought that pressure from women's groups had led to Mondale's decision, versus 22% who believed that he had chosen the best available candidate. Some members of the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church criticized the Catholic Ferraro for being pro-choice on abortion. Already fighting <b>an</b> <b>uphill</b> <b>battle</b> with voters, Ferraro also faced a slew of allegations, mid-campaign, directed toward her husband, John Zaccaro. These allegations included Zaccaro's possible past involvement in organized crime, pornography distribution, and campaign contribution violations. Ferraro responded to these allegations against her husband by releasing her family tax-returns to the media on August 21, 1984. However, the damage to the campaign was already done.|$|E
25|$|Australian Royce Simmons {{took over}} from compatriot Mick Potter {{for the start}} of the 2011 season. As the club awaited {{completion}} of the new stadium, all home fixtures in 2011 were played at the Halton Stadium in Widnes, effectively meaning St Helens were forced to play an entire season of away fixtures. In addition, they suffered upheaval in terms of the playing squad; having already lost the influential Cunningham to retirement and other club legends like Sean Long, the start of the season was overshadowed by the news that Kyle Eastmond, who had been earmarked as Long's replacement, and inspirational leader James Graham were both looking to leave the club. A number of serious injuries to further key players such as Leon Pryce and Ade Gardner meant the team was facing <b>an</b> <b>uphill</b> <b>battle</b> on the field all season. However, despite all the problems faced, St Helens defied the odds to reach their 11th Challenge Cup semi-final in a row, and at the end of the season they qualified for their 6th consecutive Grand Final. However, for the 5th year in a row they were on the losing side, as the injury-plagued squad finally succumbed to Leeds. However, the 2011 season saw the emergence of a new crop of talent, with players such as Jonny Lomax and Lee Gaskell stepping up to fill the gaps left by senior players and earning rave reviews for their performances.|$|E

5000|$|Supported by her New People's Party {{and a few}} electors from {{business}} sectors, Ip also gained a nomination from a pro-democrat elector from the Accountancy subsector, who wished to send Ip into the race to split Lam's votes. However as Lam aimed to grab more than 600 nominations, Ip faced <b>a</b> <b>uphill</b> <b>battle</b> to secure her nominations. She urged [...] "a certain candidate" [...] not to ask for additional backing since that person had secured more than enough nominations already. Ip withdrew from the election, conceding the number of nominations hours before the nomination deadline on 1 March, {{for the second time}} after her 2012 bid. She received the number of nominations [...] "far behind what was needed". She attributed her failure to the restrictive selection process of the 1,200 structure of the Election Committee membership as she was [...] "squeezed out" [...] by the Beijing-supported Lam and democrats-supported Tsang and Woo.|$|R

500|$|Lynch {{announced}} his candidacy for the U.S. Senate on January 31, 2013, seeking {{to fill the}} seat then held by John Kerry, who resigned to become U.S. Secretary of State. Lynch's candidacy in the 2013 special election had been portrayed as <b>an</b> <b>uphill</b> <b>battle</b> against liberal Democratic Rep. Ed Markey, who boasted a larger war chest and several major party endorsements. A Politico profile compared Lynch's [...] "common-man touch" [...] and moderate views to that of Republican Scott Brown, who won an unlikely Senate bid three years earlier by connecting with independent voters. Lynch lost to Markey in the April 30 Democratic primary.|$|E
500|$|From the {{beginning}} of his campaign, Goldwater fought <b>an</b> <b>uphill</b> <b>battle</b> to unseat an incumbent president under favorable economic circumstances. Goldwater consistently refused to moderate his views, which alienated {{a significant portion of the}} more moderate wing of the Republican party from his campaign. With the assistance of the media, who in large part also had an unfavorable opinion of Goldwater, President Johnson used this fissure in the party to portray [...] him as an extremist. In the general election, Goldwater lost in a landslide to Lyndon Johnson, carrying only six states to Johnson's 44 and 38% of the popular vote to Johnson's 61%.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{injuries}} to Aoki, Pagan, Pence, Panik, and Leake, the Giants remained {{deep in the}} playoff hunt, due to contributions by rookies Chris Heston and Matt Duffy, as well as Buster Posey's MVP-like season. However, with Hunter Pence out again with an oblique strain {{in the middle of}} a brutal stretch in the schedule, the Giants faced <b>a</b> major <b>uphill</b> <b>battle.</b> They acquired outfielder Marlon Byrd to deal with Pagan and Pence's absences; he made an immediate impact, almost hitting for the cycle in a 6-4 win against the Wild Card-leading Pirates.

But this wasn't the fast-paced, exciting kickoff the season needed, and too much remains unclear about the show's ongoing direction right now." ...|$|R
500|$|When Stanley sought {{re-election}} to {{his seat}} in 1924, he faced <b>an</b> <b>uphill</b> <b>battle.</b> No Kentucky senator had been re-elected {{to his seat}} in over forty years (though senators had been popularly elected only since 1914). His opposition to prohibition cost him the support of pro-temperance voters and Democratic governor William J. Fields. He was also opposed by the Ku Klux Klan, then a powerful organization in the state, because of his opposition to bigotry and secret organizations. His Republican opponent Frederic M. Sackett secured {{the support of the}} Beckham wing of the Democratic Party. Despite having his own private stock of liquor, Sackett took a pro-temperance position in the campaign and was endorsed by the Anti-Saloon League. Louisville Courier-Journal editor Robert Worth Bingham added his endorsement, calling Sackett [...] "one of the best men I know". In the general election, Stanley lost his seat by almost 25,000 votes. Sackett's victory meant Kentucky would have two Republican senators {{for the first time in}} its history.|$|E
500|$|The DuMont Television Network (also {{known as}} the DuMont Network, simply DuMont/Du Mont, or (incorrectly) Dumont [...] ) {{was one of the}} world's pioneer {{commercial}} television networks, rivalling NBC and CBS for the distinction of being first overall in the United States. It began operation in 1946. It was owned by DuMont Laboratories, a television equipment and set manufacturer. The network was hindered by the prohibitive cost of broadcasting, by regulations imposed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) which restricted the company's growth, and even by the company's partner, Paramount Pictures. Despite several innovations in broadcasting and the creation of one of television's biggest stars of the 1950s (Jackie Gleason), the network never found itself on solid financial ground. Forced to expand on UHF channels during an era when UHF tuning was not yet a standard feature on television sets, DuMont fought <b>an</b> <b>uphill</b> <b>battle</b> for program clearances outside their three owned-and-operated stations in New York, Washington, D.C. and Pittsburgh, finally ending network operations in 1956.|$|E
500|$|As the {{election}} of 1852 approached, Fillmore remained undecided whether to run for a full term as president. Secretary Webster had long coveted the presidency and, though past seventy, planned a final attempt to gain the White House. Fillmore was sympathetic to the ambitions of his longtime friend, but though he issued a letter in late 1851 stating {{that he did not}} seek a full term, was reluctant to rule it out, fearing the party would be captured by the Sewardites. [...] Thus, approaching the [...] national convention in Baltimore, to be held in June 1852, the major candidates were Fillmore, Webster and General Scott. Weed and Seward backed Scott; in late May, the Democrats nominated former New Hampshire senator Franklin Pierce, who had been out of national politics for nearly a decade before 1852, but whose profile had risen {{as a result of his}} military service in the Mexican War. The nomination of Pierce, a northerner sympathetic to the southern view on slavery, united the Democrats and meant the Whig candidate would face <b>an</b> <b>uphill</b> <b>battle</b> to gain the presidency.|$|E
