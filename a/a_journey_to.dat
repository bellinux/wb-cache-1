5|$|Manutius {{at first}} printed works only in Greek.

5|$|Modern historians, however, {{doubt the}} {{veracity}} of this theory. For one thing, notes Kenneth R.

5|$|Set {{in modern}} times on the fictional Mallet Island, the story centers on Dante, a demon hunter who uses his {{business}} to get his revenge on the demons after losing his brother and mother.

The story is told primarily through a mixture of cutscenes, which use the game's engine and several pre-rendered full motion videos.
