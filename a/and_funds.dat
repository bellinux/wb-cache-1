However, mutual funds still experience efficiency inconsistency on their operating activities. This research’s purpose is to analyse the efficiency level on each mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> to compare efficiency between stock mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> fixed-income mutual <b>funds,</b> stock mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> mixed mutual <b>funds,</b> stock mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> protected mutual <b>funds,</b> mixed mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> protected mutual <b>funds,</b> fixed-income mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> mixed mutual <b>funds,</b> <b>and</b> fixed-income mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> protected mutual <b>funds.</b> There are eighty-nine mutual funds used as samples done by purposive sampling on this research; twenty-nine stock mutual funds, twenty-nine fixed-income mutual funds, twenty-one mixed mutual <b>funds,</b> <b>and</b> nine protected mutual funds. This research used Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method. A Unit Kegiatan Ekonomi (UKE) is considered efficient if the efficiency value reachs perfection (100 percent), on the contrary when the efficiency value is less than 100 percent, then the UKE is rated as inefficient. The variables on this research are chosen based on intermediation approach. The input variables are standard deviation of return, investation processing services cost ratio, custodian services cost ratio, other fees cost ratio, and redemption cost; and the output variables are average return and assets growth toward return. To find out the efficiency value difference on each mutual funds, the research used Mann Whitney U test. The result of analysis using DEA method indicated that fixed-income mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> mixed mutual <b>funds</b> during 2008 - 2011 incline to have efficiency increase even though it’s fluctuating with the average of 84. 03 percent in fixed-income mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> 81. 04 percent in mixed mutual funds. Mann Whitney U hypothesis testing shows that there is no efficiency difference between stock mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> fixed-income mutual <b>funds,</b> mixed mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> protected mutual <b>funds,</b> fixed-income mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> protected mutual <b>funds,</b> <b>and</b> stock mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> mixed mutual <b>funds</b> during 2008 - 2011; but there is an efficiency difference between stock mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> protected mutual <b>funds,</b> <b>and</b> fixed-income mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> mixed mutual <b>funds</b> during 2008 - 201...|$|R

The Center´s main task is studies of voting and {{election}} methods emphazising sequential choice <b>and</b> <b>fund</b> voting <b>and</b> giving consulting service in the field. The activities are presented on the Democracy Center website and by publishing books.The aim is to make Sequential Choice <b>and</b> <b>Fund</b> Voting known the world over. This happens by publishing Democracy with Sequential Choice <b>and</b> <b>Fund</b> Voting on different languages. This also happens by making people used to take sequential choice <b>and</b> <b>fund</b> voting into account when issues are formed and then submitted for decision. Not least concerns this people in position, members of parliament and people in public administration, national and international. The publishing of Democracy with Sequential Choice <b>and</b> <b>Fund</b> Voting as a research report from Political Science Institute, Oslo University, {{made it possible to}} become acquainted with sequential choice <b>and</b> <b>fund</b> voting in a historical continuity within the theory of group choice and in the light of a different kind of empirical cases in Iceland. Although the monograph was composed to be published by an academic institute it was devised for the informed public.

5|$|Resources <b>and</b> <b>funds</b> {{were needed}} to {{construct}} most memorials, particular larger monuments or building projects; sometimes professional services could be acquired for nothing, but normally designers, workmen and suppliers had to be paid. Different countries approached this problem in various ways, depending on local culture {{and the role of}} the state. Despite the special nature of the memorials, contractual arguments and issues over costs, timings and specifications were common, from smaller works in villages through to major works, such as the Vimy Memorial. The sheer volume of work encouraged industrial innovation: carving the inscriptions into the many thousands of British memorial stones had to originally be undertaken by hand, for example, until a Lancashire company invented an automated engraving process.|$|E

5|$|Until the 1990s, {{there was}} little focus on {{expansion}} of the system because the system {{was in a state}} of disrepair, <b>and</b> <b>funds</b> were allocated to rebuilding and repairing the existing system.

Construction of the Second Avenue Subway started in 2007, and the first phase was completed in 2017. Since the 1990s, public officials and organizations such as the Regional Plan Association have pushed for the further expansion of the system. Projects such as the TriboroRx, a circumferential line connecting the outer boroughs, the reuse of the Rockaway Beach Branch, and the further expansion of the Second Avenue Subway have all been proposed, albeit unfunded.|$|E

5|$|An Act of Parliament {{was passed}} {{to allow a}} wrought iron {{suspension}} bridge to be built instead of stone, and tolls levied to recoup the cost. A company was formed <b>and</b> <b>funds</b> raised {{during the first few}} months of 1830, but the money raised was not sufficient for the construction. Despite this, the act received Royal Assent in May 1830. Brunel produced a new proposal costing £10,000 less than Telford's design and gained support for it in the local press. James Meadows Rendel, William Armstrong and William Hill also submitted new, cheaper proposals, complaining that the committee had not set a budget. In 1831 a second competition was held, with new judges including Davies Gilbert and John Seaward examining the engineering qualities of the proposals. Thirteen designs were submitted; Telford's was the only one in which the chains achieved the weight per square inch required by the judges but it was rejected as being too expensive. The winner was declared to be a design by Smith and Hawkes of the Eagle Foundry in Birmingham. Brunel had a personal meeting with Gilbert and persuaded him to change the decision. The committee then declared Brunel the winner and he was awarded a contract as project engineer. The winning design was for a suspension bridge with fashionably Egyptian-influenced towers. In 2010, newly discovered letters and documents revealed that, in producing his design, Brunel had taken advice from his father, Sir Marc Isambard Brunel. The elder Brunel had recommended including a central support for the bridge, as he did not believe a single-span bridge of such length could be constructed. His son chose to ignore his advice.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 1970s the museum {{acquired}} several important American aircraft; a B-17G Flying Fortress in 1978, a B-29 Superfortress in 1980, and a B-52 Stratofortress in 1983. With Duxford's {{association with the}} US Army Air Forces (USAAF), in the mid-1980s plans developed for a commemoration {{of the role of}} American air power in the Second World War. A group of American supporters was formed, and the architect Sir Norman Foster was commissioned to design a new building. Fundraising for the project began in 1987, support <b>and</b> <b>funds</b> being sought in the United States; the Founding Member was General Jimmy Doolittle in 1989. Fundraising events were held across the US in Houston (1989), Washington, D.C., (1991) and Los Angeles (1992). The project was widely supported in the United States by some 50,000 individual subscribers. A further $1million of funding was secured from Saudi Arabia, and £6.5million from the Heritage Lottery Fund. On 8 September 1995 the groundbreaking for the new building was performed by wartime 78th Fighter Group veteran, Major James E Stokes.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the project}} was not without its trials. Edwards' initial plan to employ a team of writers was thwarted {{by a lack of}} {{resources}} <b>and</b> <b>funds.</b> He instead had to enlist historians based outside of the AWM for some of the volumes, who agreed to work on the history without financial compensation. The series also experienced problems with staff turnover. Aside from Pemberton, the unexpected death in 1998 of Ian McNeill—author of the volumes on the Australian Army—caused extensive delays to the series' completion. The first seven volumes (including McNeill's To Long Tan , dealing with army operations up to 1966), were delivered in a timely fashion and published successively from 1992 to 1998. However, McNeill's next volume was only partway written when he died. His research assistant, Ashley Ekins, was eventually appointed to complete the series. On the Offensive was published in 2003, while the final volume, Fighting to the Finish, appeared in 2012; two decades after the first volume, and sixteen years after Edwards' position at the AWM had ended. Again following the path of Bean and Long, Edwards was then commissioned by the AWM to write a single volume summary of the series. Australia and the Vietnam War was published by NewSouth in 2014.|$|E
