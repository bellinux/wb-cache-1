50|$|<b>Ad</b> <b>tracking,</b> {{also known}} as {{post-testing}} or ad effectiveness tracking, is in-market research that monitors a brandâ€™s performance including brand and advertising awareness, product trial and usage, and attitudes about the brand versus their competition.|$|E
50|$|Today, most <b>ad</b> <b>tracking</b> {{studies are}} {{conducted}} via the Internet. Some <b>ad</b> <b>tracking</b> studies are conducted continuously {{and others are}} conducted at specific points in time (typically before the advertising appears in market, and then again after the advertising has been running for some period of time). The two approaches use different types of analyses, although both start by measuring advertising awareness. Typically, the respondent is either shown a brief portion of a commercial or a few memorable still images from the TV ad. Other media typically are cued using either branded or de-branded visual of the ad. Then, respondents answer three significant questions.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} tools to effectively track online ads: banner ads, ppc ads, pop-up ads, and other types. Several online advertising {{companies such as}} Google offer their own <b>ad</b> <b>tracking</b> service in order to effectively use their service to generate a positive ROI. Third-party <b>ad</b> <b>tracking</b> services are commonly used by affiliate marketers. Affiliate marketers are frequently unable {{to have access to}} the order page and therefore are unable to use a 3rd-party tool. Many different companies have created tools to effectively track their commissions in order to optimize their profit potential. The information provided will show the marketer which advertising methods are generating income and which are not. This information will allow the marketer to effectively allocate his budget in the best possible way.|$|E

50|$|Advertisers use {{the results}} of <b>ad</b> <b>tracking</b> to {{estimate}} the return on investment (ROI) of advertising, and to refine advertising plans.

5000|$|<b>Ad</b> <b>tracking</b> or {{campaign}} tracking {{refers to}} techniques {{used to monitor}} the [...] "in-market performance" [...] of advertising. <b>Ad</b> <b>tracking</b> uses a combination of pre-testing and post-testing. Pre-testing is used to establish benchmarks against which the actual performance of a campaign can be measured {{during and after the}} campaign has run. A particular area of concern during an advertising campaign is the problem of advertising wear-out. When audiences are repeatedly exposed to the same message, the level of attention begins to plateau and eventually decays. Any further repetitions may cease to be noticed or may alienate target audiences. When wear-out occurs, additional advertising expenditure is simply wasted. One way that advertisers avoid wear-out is to use repetition with variation - that is, the use of different executions of the same message. Campaign tracking can assist advertisers to determine when to introduce a new execution of the same advertising message or to fine-tune the campaign.|$|E
