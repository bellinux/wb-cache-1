Kanyenke {{believes}} that his sister, Nonahkee, could be in danger, too, and the pair leaves for New England.

After the battle it is revealed that John Black and Nonahkee are in love, but <b>are</b> <b>keeping</b> it a secret from Kanyenke until a more peaceful time, although it is seen that Kanyenke is aware of this.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to her barrier city, Aki joins Sid and appears before the leadership council along with General Hein (James Woods), who is determined to use the powerful Zeus space cannon to destroy the Phantoms. Aki is concerned the cannon will damage Earth's Gaia (a spirit representing its ecosystem) and delays the use of it by revealing {{that she has been}} infected and the collected spirit signatures <b>are</b> <b>keeping</b> her infection stable, convincing the council that there may be another way to defeat the Phantoms. However, this revelation leads Hein to incorrectly conclude that she is being controlled by the Phantoms. Aki and the Deep Eyes squad succeed in finding the seventh spirit as Aki's infection begins to worsen and she slips into unconsciousness. Her dream reveals to her that the Phantoms are the spirits of dead aliens brought to Earth on a fragment of their destroyed planet. Sid uses the seventh spirit to bring Aki's infection back under control, reviving her.|$|E

25|$|Public Agenda {{has also}} concluded, however, that the public's sympathy has limits. In a 2002 {{national}} survey, the organization found 74 percent say the police should leave {{a homeless person}} alone {{if they are not}} bothering anyone.

25|$|Although Muscadet and Gros Plant white {{wines are}} {{produced}} {{south of the}} Loire, the traditional drink of Brittany is cider. Brittany is the second-largest cider-producing region in France. Breton cider is traditionally served in a bowl or a cup. Brittany also has a long beer-brewing tradition, tracing its roots back to the 17th century. Young artisanal brewers <b>are</b> <b>keeping</b> a variety of beer types alive, such as Coreff de Morlaix, Tri Martolod and Britt.

25|$|Non {{medication}} based strategies provide {{long lasting}} improvements to insomnia and are recommended {{as a first}} line and long-term strategy of management. The strategies include attention to sleep hygiene, stimulus control, behavioral interventions, sleep-restriction therapy, paradoxical intention, patient education and relaxation therapy.

Behavioral therapy can assist a patient in developing new sleep behaviors to improve sleep quality and consolidation. Behavioral therapy may include, learning healthy sleep habits to promote sleep relaxation, undergoing light therapy to help with worry-reduction strategies and regulating the circadian clock.|$|E
25|$|In many {{countries}} the traditional divisions between barristers and solicitors are breaking down. Barristers once enjoyed {{a monopoly on}} appearances before the higher courts, but in Great Britain this has now been abolished, and solicitor advocates can generally appear for clients at trial. Increasingly, firms of solicitors <b>are</b> <b>keeping</b> even the most advanced advisory and litigation work in-house for economic and client relationship reasons. Similarly, the prohibition on barristers taking instructions directly from the public has also been widely abolished. But, in practice, direct instruction is still a rarity in most jurisdictions, partly because barristers with narrow specializations, or who are only really trained for advocacy, {{are not prepared to}} provide general advice to members of the public.|$|E

Ripley scares the amateur thugs into dashing out of the apartment, and he single-handedly rescues the semi-conscious hostage.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} {{football}} season arrived, Schulz's academic problems had worsened. [...] Contemporary reports indicated that [...] "It is not physical conditions which <b>are</b> <b>keeping</b> the giant player {{from the game}} (as was announced), but educational ones". [...] In early October 1908, Schulz had [...] "three conditions in the engineering course, more than a player can carry and continue his athletic relations". [...] Though [...] "every effort" [...] had been made for two weeks to have the conditions removed, those efforts had failed. [...] A meeting of the eligibility board was held, and they concluded that Schulz could not play until he removed {{at least two of}} the conditions. [...] While it was possible for Schulz to remove the conditions by the end of October by [...] "burning the midnight oil", it was reported that [...] "this is an optimistic view of the situation shared by few".|$|E

[...] While Yang was on pediatric service, she impersonated a bear, and PopSugar called her voice [...] "priceless". They were also positive about Stevens' storyline, saying: [...] "At first it seemed super annoying but was pretty sweet {{by the end of the}} episode."

Marlene considers Ben weak, so Leslie becomes determined to prove that he is a tough boss to impress Marlene.|$|E

[...] Chambers explained of his decision to leave: [...] "I was worried about telling the bosses, but I wrote a long letter to the producers explaining my decision and they were incredibly nice about it.

[...] Several episodes before the character's departure, his estranged son Kieron played by Misha Crosby, was introduced to Holby City. Father and son both developed romantic feelings for nurse Maria Kendall, leading to Sam asking her to accompany them both to New York, where Kieron was a famous violinist.
