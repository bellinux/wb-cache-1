In <b>alcoholic</b> patients, <b>delirium</b> or pre-delirium associated with alcohol withdrawal can be alleviated by administration of 400-1200 mg/day {{or up to}} 1800 mg/day if necessary. Tremors and other dyskinsias can be treated with 300-800 mg/day. For reducing agitation and aggression in elderly patients, 200-300 mg/day is recommended.|$|R

5000|$|To {{this end}} du Bellay {{recommended}} vernacular innovation of Greek and Roman poetic forms, emulation of specific models, {{and the creation}} of neologisms based on Greek and Latin. Among the models favoured by the Pléiade were Pindar, Anacreon, Alcaeus and other poets of the Greek Anthology, as well as Virgil, Horace and Ovid. The ideal was not one of slavish imitation, but of a poet so well-versed in the entire corpus of Ancient literature (du Bellay uses the metaphor of [...] "digestion") that {{he would be able to}} convert it into an entirely new and rich poetic language in the vernacular. For some of the members of the Pléiade, the act of the poetry itself was seen as a form of divine inspiration (see Pontus de Tyard for example), a possession by the muses akin to romantic passion, prophetic fervor or <b>alcoholic</b> <b>delirium.</b>|$|E
50|$|Causes of {{formication}} include normal {{states such}} as onset of menopause (i.e. hormone withdrawal). Other causes are medical conditions such as pesticide exposure, mercury poisoning, diabetic neuropathy, skin cancer, syphilis, Lyme disease or herpes zoster (shingles). Formication can {{be a result of}} stimulant intoxication (e.g. methamphetamines, cocaine) or alcohol withdrawal in <b>alcoholics</b> (i.e. <b>delirium</b> tremens), and is often accompanied by visual hallucinations of insects (formicanopia). It can also occur as a symptom of benzodiazepine withdrawal and as a side effect of opioid analgesics.|$|R

The term dates back to at least the early 20th century, emerging from earlier idioms about snakes and other creatures.

It is both a penetrating study of addiction, and a harrowing study of descents into personal hells. Solares’ father had experienced delirium tremens when Solares was a boy.|$|R

Next year, the band released their first studio album called Alkoholen delirium (<b>Alcoholic</b> <b>Delirium).</b> The band immediately launched a self-bankrolled national tour, which turned quite successful. At one of the tour concerts in Varna, a mass alcohol-fuelled disorder erupted and all band members and some of the audience were arrested. This event, along with the explicit lyrics of most of their songs gave Hipodil their [...] "scandal aura".|$|E

Nicotinic acid deficiency encephalopathy {{is characterized by a}} disturbance of consciousness, cogwheel rigidity of the limbs, forced grasping, cerebellar ataxia, <b>alcoholic</b> <b>delirium</b> and polyneuritis first reported by Jolliffe et al (1940). This syndrome should be treated with multiple vitamins in addition to nicotinic acid, because deficiency of a single vitamin is rare.

40|$|Alcohol {{is a drug}} {{consumed}} at {{some time}} in life by up to 80 % of the population according to western statistics. Wide differences in socioeconomic status in India contribute to various degrees and severity of alcoholism and its associated complications. The symptoms of alcohol withdrawal range from such minor ones as insomnia and tremulousness to severe complications such as withdrawal seizures and delirium tremens. Although alcohol withdrawal syndrome has been reported in the literature in post-operative periods and in Intensive Care Unit, there is paucity of information on treatment and preparation of a patient with alcohol withdrawal syndrome coming for emergency surgical procedures. The surgical stress and deranged liver function in such cases poses an additional challenge to the anaesthesiologist. Here, we report the successful management of a case of acute <b>alcoholic</b> <b>delirium</b> tremens who presented with hollow viscous perforation for emergency exploratory laparotomy...|$|E
40|$|Acute loss {{of vision}} and {{alcoholic}} intoxication suggests the possibility of methanol poisoning. In this report we describe an alcoholic patient who complained of blindness after recovering from <b>alcoholic</b> pancreatitis and <b>delirium</b> tremens. Visual acuity was severely impaired and fundoscopy revealed florid bilateral cotton wool spots and a cherry red spot at the right macula. Such appearances have previously been reported in cases of post-traumatic visual loss, and may share a common aetiology of fat embolization. The association between alcoholic pancreatitis and visual loss is rare, and fundal examination should be performed on all patients with pancreatitis, especially those who complain of visual disturbance...|$|R
50|$|Both {{alcoholic}} hallucinosis and DTs {{have been}} {{thought of as}} different manifestations of the same physiological process in the body during alcohol withdrawal. Alcoholic hallucinosis is a much less serious diagnosis than delirium tremens. Delirium tremens (DTs) do not appear suddenly, unlike alcoholic hallucinosis. DTs also take approximately 48 to 72 hours to appear after the heavy drinking stops. A tremor develops in the hands and can also affect the head and body. A common symptom of delirium tremens is that people become severely uncoordinated. The biggest difference between <b>alcoholic</b> hallucinosis and <b>delirium</b> tremens is that alcoholic hallucinosis {{have a much better}} prognosis than DTs. Moreover, delirium tremens can be fatal when untreated.|$|R
5000|$|Laruelle is {{scheduled}} to leave Quauhnahuac the next day, but has not yet packed and {{does not want to}} go home, spending his time instead at the Cervecería XX, a bar connected to the local cinema, run by Sr. Bustamente. At that bar, he is given a book he had borrowed {{a year and a half}} before from the Consul—an anthology of Elizabethan plays he had meant to use for a film on the Faustus myth. Playing a variation on Sortes virgilianae, his eyes fall on the closing words of the chorus in Marlowe's Doctor Faustus, [...] "Cut is the branch that might have grown full straight...", then finds a desperate letter by the Consul to Yvonne, a final plea for her to return, interspersed with descriptions of <b>alcoholic</b> stupor and <b>delirium</b> tremens. Laruelle burns the letter. A bell outside sounds dolente, dolore to close the chapter.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies in}} {{alcoholic}} patients and normal control subjects demonstrated a characteristic increase in urinary tryptamine after acute ingestion of ethanol. This response could be attributable only {{in part to}} monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibition, verified by in vitro experiments. Evidence for an amine-releasing action of ethanol (suggestive but not conclusive in man) indicated a possible mechanism to account for this discrepancy. Other studies, conducted separately on a similar population, indicated activation of adrenocortical function by acute ingestion of ethanol. Similarly, activation of the sympathoadrenal system was suggested by increased excretion of epinephrine after ethanol. Present experi-ments were done to explore the possibility of adrenal activation being related to increased amine excretion seen with tryptamine after ethanol. Patients injected with 100 -mg. hydrocortisone failed to show any demonstrable changes in urinary amines. Injection of epinephrine was followed by changes in urinary amines {{similar to those found}} with ethanol. These preliminary findings suggest further approach to question of amine-releasing action of ethanol.
