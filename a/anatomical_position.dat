5|$|Motion, {{the process}} of movement, is {{described}} using specific anatomical terms. Motion includes movement of organs, joints, limbs, and specific sections of the body. The terminology used describes this motion according to its direction relative to the <b>anatomical</b> <b>position</b> of the joints. Anatomists use a unified set of terms to describe most of the movements, although other, more specialized terms are necessary for describing {{the uniqueness of the}} movements such as those of the hands, feet, and eyes.|$|E
5|$|The type {{specimen}} belonged to an aged individual. Its taphonomy is unusual {{as it was}} found lying on its back – in contrast, most other nearly complete dinosaur skeletons of the Nemegt Formation usually are found lying on their sides. The specimen was found encased in cross-bedded sandstone deposited by a river. Most of the discovered vertebrae were still connected together, forming a continuous series that consisted of 8 dorsal, 6 sacral and 34 caudal vertebrae. An additional 3 vertebrae were found isolated from the series and may belong to the transitional area between back and neck. The remaining parts of the skeleton were shifted slightly out of their original <b>anatomical</b> <b>position.</b> Both the left limb and rib bones {{were found on the}} right side of the body, while conversely the right limb and rib bones were found on the left side. Bite marks have been identified on the skeleton, particularly in the pelvis and the thigh bone, showing that predators had fed on the carcass. The skull and neck are missing, indicating that the carnivores might have carried away these body parts. The completeness of the remains indicate that the individual had died near the discovery site. A flooding event might have transported the carcass a short distance and subsequently covered it with sediment, even before the soft tissue had decayed entirely.|$|E

40|$|A {{technique}} for <b>anatomical</b> <b>positioning</b> of a synthetic aortoaxillary bypass tube graft is described. A tunnel is created {{with the help}} of a Roberts clamp and intercostal tube drain.

25|$|Radial {{referring}} to the radius bone, seen laterally in the standard <b>anatomical</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because {{animals can}} change {{orientation}} {{with respect to}} their environment, and because appendages like limbs and tentacles can change position with respect to the main body, positional descriptive terms need to refer to the animal as in its standard <b>anatomical</b> <b>position.</b> All descriptions are with respect to the organism in its standard <b>anatomical</b> <b>position,</b> even when the organism in question has appendages in another position. This helps avoid confusion in terminology when referring to the same organism in different postures.|$|E
25|$|Using the {{standard}} <b>anatomical</b> <b>position</b> reduces confusion. It means {{that regardless of}} the position of a body, the position of structures within it can be described without ambiguity.|$|E
40|$|Parkinson's Disease (PD) is {{characterized}} by typical motor and non-motor symptoms {{one of which is}} rigidity. Today numerous therapy strategies exist. In the last decades, patients with symptoms refractory to medical therapy became candidates for neurosurgical interventions. Targeted areas for ablation or deep brain stimulation are thalamus, pallidum and subthalamic nucleus (STN). Next to <b>anatomical</b> <b>positioning,</b> neurophysciological assessment is essential for optimal positioning of the electrodes in these procedures. Proper positioning of the electrodes is based on MR/CT based <b>anatomical</b> <b>positioning</b> in a stereotactic frame, micro-electrode recordings for neurophysiological positioning, low frequency stimulation to detect interference with internal capsule fibers and high frequency stimulation to detect interference with internal capsule fibers and high frequency stimulation for evaluation of clinical improvement of symptoms and of side effects. The ongoing development of neurosurgical therapies and consequent demand for intra-operative neuromonitoring have stressed the need for quantification of rigidity, since in some procedures (targeted pallidum and STN) rigidity {{is one of the few}} parkinsonian symptoms which are present. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTObjective: To compare ACL {{reconstruction}} with <b>anatomical</b> <b>positioning</b> of {{the tunnels}} using the hamstring or patellar tendons. Methods: We prospectively evaluated 52 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using the Chambat's technique, with <b>anatomical</b> <b>positioning</b> of the tunnels drilled outside in. They {{were divided into}} group A, with 27 patients, using the patellar tendon as a graft, and group B, with 25 patients, using the hamstring. Results: In group A 26 patients were very satisfied or satisfied and 1 unhappy, in group B. 25 patients were very satisfied or satisfied with the procedure (p = 0. 990). According to the Lysholm scale, group A had a mean score of 96. 11 and group B, 95. 32 (p= 0. 594). In relation to preoperative IKDC, 100 % of the patients in group A and 92 % of those in group B were IKDC C or D (p = 0. 221); in the assessment {{with a minimum of}} two-year follow-up, 96 % of group A and 92 % of group B were IKDC A or B (p = 0. 256). The Lachman test, pivot shift, return to sports activities, and the comparative difference in anterior translation (RolimeterTM) also showed no statistically significant difference. In group A, 5 patients (18. 5 %) were unable to kneel on a hard surface, whereas no patient in group B had this complaint. Conclusion: The anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction presents similar results using the hamstring or patellar tendon with <b>anatomical</b> <b>positioning</b> of the tunnels.

30|$|Routine {{abdominal}} and rectal ultrasounds {{were performed}} on all patients for pelvic organ (uterus, ovaries, bladder) localizations. Ovaries were in their normal <b>anatomical</b> <b>positions</b> in all patients. Routine intravenous pyelogram (IVP) was performed on all patients to check for ureter and renal anomalies. Five patients had an ectopic kidney. One patient {{did not have a}} fifth finger on her left hand. Karyotype analysis was performed on all patients.|$|R
25|$|Movement {{types are}} {{generally}} paired, with one being {{the opposite of}} the other. Body movements are always described in relation to the <b>anatomical</b> <b>position</b> of the body: upright stance, with upper limbs to the side of body and palms facing forward.|$|E
25|$|The distal {{fragment}} {{of the first}} metacarpal bone possesses {{the majority of the}} articular surface of the first CMC joint. Unlike the proximal fracture fragment, strong ligaments and muscle tendons of the hand tend to pull this fragment out of its correct <b>anatomical</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of the Bennett fracture, the {{proximal}} metacarpal fragment remains attached to the anterior oblique ligament, which in turn is attached to the tubercle of the trapezium bone of the CMC joint.

25|$|When anatomists {{refer to}} the right and left of the body, it is in {{reference}} {{to the right and}} left of the subject, not the right and left of the observer. When observing a body in the <b>anatomical</b> <b>position,</b> the left of the body is on the observer’s right, and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Tension {{from the}} APL and ADP muscles {{frequently}} leads to {{displacement of the}} fracture fragments, even {{in cases where the}} fracture fragments are initially in their proper anatomic position. Because of the aforementioned biomechanical features, Bennett fractures nearly always require some form of intervention to ensure healing in the correct <b>anatomical</b> <b>position</b> and restoration of proper function of the thumb CMC joint.|$|E
500|$|Palmarflexion and {{dorsiflexion}} {{refer to}} {{movement of the}} flexion (palmarflexion) or extension (dorsiflexion) of the hand at the wrist. [...] These terms refer to flexion between the hand and the body's dorsal surface, which in <b>anatomical</b> <b>position</b> is considered {{the back of the}} arm; and flexion between the hand and the body's palmar surface, which in <b>anatomical</b> <b>position</b> is considered the anterior side of the arm.

30|$|Adnexal torsion in {{pregnancy}} is rare with a reported incidence {{of one in}} 1, 000 pregnancies [1]. Adnexal masses between 6 and 8  cm have {{a higher risk of}} torsion compared with other sizes with about 60 % of these occurring between 10 and 17  weeks gestation [2]. The risk of torsion {{in pregnancy}} is increased due to altered <b>anatomical</b> <b>positioning</b> of abdominal organs [3], and also as a result of enlarged ovaries following ovulation induction in cases of assisted conception [4].|$|R
40|$|Nutritional {{support in}} {{critically}} ill patients {{is a fundamental}} principle of patient care. Little is known about gallbladder motility during the interdigestive phase {{and in response to}} enteral feeding. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of enteral feeding on gallbladder function in dogs. The cholagogue meal (Lipofundin infusion) was applied in four <b>anatomical</b> <b>positions</b> (jejunum, duodenojejunal junction, descending duodenum, stomach) in five healthy Beagle dogs. Gallbladder volume (GBV) was monitored by ultrasonography. Lipofundin infusion given through the feeding tube caused a maximal gallbladder contraction of 9. 2 % (range 3. 7 – 13. 9 %) in the jejunum, 16. 5 % (9. 1 – 22. 1 %) at the duodenojejunal junction and 26. 3 % (22. 8 – 29. 5 %) in the descending duodenum. When the cholagogue meal was given through the mouth, it caused a mean 33. 8 % (28. 6 – 46. 5 %) maximum gallbladder contraction in the same animals. In conclusion, we can establish that the ultrasound-guided gallbladder emptying method proved to be a useful technique for monitoring the cholagogue effect of Lipofundin meal applied in different <b>anatomical</b> <b>positions</b> of the intestine. The deeper the position of application, the smaller and shorter gallbladder contraction was evoked...|$|R
40|$|Perception {{of color}} and its {{relationship}} to water holding capacity are important for defining the yield and quality of the pork production process. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the relationship among color measurements taken at various <b>anatomical</b> <b>positions</b> in the cross-sectional surface of pork loin steak, and measurements of fluid exudation and its glucose concentration, as well as the impact on these attributes due to plasma glucose at slaughter. Two assays were conducted sequentially: i) investigation of the surface color parameters at different <b>anatomical</b> <b>positions</b> in the pork loin cross-section and their relationship to general exudation; and ii) the effect of plasma glucose levels on surface color variables, drip loss and glucose exudate concentration in three anatomical regions in the steak. The L* value of the ventro-lateral region, in the first assay, had the highest correlation with average steak drip loss at all anatomical points, exudation increasing proportionally between 48 and 72 h. The hue angle was also positively correlated with drip loss and lightness. The drip loss was greater when the animals had high plasma glucose, especially in the intermediate and lateral regions of the steak surface. The intermediate region presented greater lightness and lower redness. The plasma and glucose exudate concentrations, potential indicators of the muscle glycolytic metabolism, were related to color and drip loss. These variables can be influenced by the anatomical region inside the muscle, impacting the ability to retain water, two-toning occurrence and overall pork loin quality...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} {{investigation}} extensive calvariectomy was performed on neonatal rabbits and the subsequent regeneration of the calvarium was followed grossly, radiographically and histologically. The results indicate that regeneration of the calvarium is a gradual process which exhibits a definite pattern and rate. Furthermore, although the sutural articulations re-develop in their proper <b>anatomical</b> <b>positions</b> and exhibit normal histological structure, they tend to synostose earlier than controls. Of perhaps greater biological significance is the apparent importance of the periosteal envelope during the regenerative process. Maintenance of dural integrity during operation, and the re-establishment of pericranial continuity post-operatively, seem to be essential for restoration of normal sutural and skeletal architecture...|$|R

30|$|Although ACL reconstructions provide {{satisfactory}} clinical results nowadays, {{regardless of}} the type of graft or the surgical technique used (out-in vs in-out or single- vs double-bundle), the residual rotatory instability which is often detected at clinical follow-ups is still a matter of concern among surgeons. In this paper we try to analyze all the aspects which might contribute to this phenomenon by summarizing the biomechanical functions of the two bundles of the ACL, and by evaluating all the other factors strictly related to the rotatory instability of a reconstructed knee, such as the <b>anatomical</b> <b>positioning</b> of the single- or double-bundle new ACL, or the importance of a valid lateral compartment (LCL, ALTFL). Clinical, biomechanical and cadaver studies are discussed in order to contribute to better understanding of the origin of post-operative residual rotatory instability.|$|R

To test possible mechanisms underlying these differences, we analyzed properties of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current Ih in voltage-clamp recordings from stellate cells in entorhinal slices from different dorsal–ventral locations. The time constant of h current was significantly different between dorsal and ventral neurons. The time constant of h current correlated with membrane potential oscillation frequency and the time constant of the sag potential in the same neurons. Differences in h current could underlie differences in membrane potential oscillation properties and contribute to grid cell periodicity along the dorsal–ventral axis of medial entorhinal cortex...|$|R
