5|$|A {{disaster}} {{struck the}} colony on 13 August 2010, when a forest fire {{swept through the}} breeding site killing three adults and 25 of the 38 chicks. The fire destroyed the vegetation and several nesting burrows. Conservation action to protect the 13 remaining chicks included removing dead birds and burnt vegetation, reinforcing the surviving nests, and setting poison bait for rats around the now exposed nest sites. In the longer term, the action plan includes the provision of artificial burrows, seed dispersal to help the vegetation recover, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> anti-erosion materials.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{industrial}} development quickened. New technology increased farm productivity through automation of feedlots for hogs and cattle, machine milking at dairy farms, and raising chickens in large buildings. Planting became more specialized with hybridization {{of corn and}} wheat, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> farm machinery such as tractors and combines became the norm. University of Minnesota professor Norman Borlaug contributed to these developments {{as part of the}} Green Revolution. Suburban development accelerated due to increased postwar housing demand and convenient transportation. Increased mobility, in turn, enabled more specialized jobs.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture {{also made}} up an {{important}} part of the Plymouth economy. The colonists adopted Native American agricultural practices and crops. They planted maize, squash, pumpkins, beans, and potatoes. Besides the crops themselves, the Pilgrims learned productive farming techniques from the Native Americans, such as proper crop rotation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> dead fish to fertilize the soil. In addition to these native crops, the colonists also successfully planted Old World crops such as turnips, carrots, peas, wheat, barley, and oats.|$|E

5|$|Another {{criticism}} {{pertains to}} the shift in training focus {{after the end of}} Ueshiba's seclusion in Iwama from 1942 to the mid-1950s, as he increasingly emphasized the spiritual and philosophical aspects of aikido. As a result, strikes to vital points by tori, entering (irimi) and initiation of techniques by tori, the distinction between omote (front side) and ura (back side) techniques, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice. Some Aikido practitioners feel that lack of training in these areas leads to an overall loss of effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists {{divide the}} pre-European American contact {{period of the}} region into three {{cultural}} phases. The Crane Flat phase lasted from 1000BCE to 500CE and is marked by hunting with the atl atl <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> grinding stones. The Tarmarack phase lasted from 500 until 1200, marked by a shift to using smaller rock points, indicating {{development and use of}} the bow and arrow. The Mariposa phase lasted from 1200 until contact with European Americans.|$|E
5|$|As {{feathers}} grow at variable rates, these variations lead to visible {{dark and}} light bands in the fully formed feather.

5|$|As {{with other}} forms {{with a long}} history in many languages, many {{variations}} have been developed, including forms with a quasi-musical poetic diction in Urdu. Ghazals have a classical affinity with Sufism, and a number of major Sufi religious works are written in ghazal form. The relatively steady meter <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the refrain produce an incantatory effect, which complements Sufi mystical themes well. Among the masters of the form is Rumi, a 13th-century Persian poet.|$|E
5|$|Aspects of Raonic's game {{which have}} been criticized include his return of serve, quickness and mobility, backhand, short game, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> {{backspin}} or sidespin.

5|$|Built {{predominantly}} of Old Red Sandstone, {{the bridge}} {{was the subject of}} significant reconstruction and rebuilding in the 18th and 19th centuries.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the visual feedback influence on pelvic floor muscle contraction. Study design: Seventeen nulliparous, urinary-continent women participated in this study. Pelvic floor muscle strength with <b>and</b> without <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> visual feedback was measured with a dynamometric speculum in two directions (anteroposterior and left-right). To compare the mean strength values with <b>and</b> without <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> visual feedback, <b>the</b> t test was applied. Results: There was no significant difference between the pelvic floor muscle anteroposterior strength values with <b>and</b> without <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> visual feedback (p = 0. 30), and no significant difference for the left-right strength (p = 0. 37). Conclusion: There was no difference between the pelvic floor muscle strength values with <b>and</b> without <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> visual feedback. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

5|$|Deforestation {{has also}} caused {{population}} declines for the vulnerable Yunnan and yellow-billed nuthatches. The Yunnan nuthatch can cope with some tree loss, since it prefers open pine woodland, but although still locally common, it has disappeared from {{several of the}} areas in which it was recorded in the early 20th century. The threat to yellow-billed is particularly acute on Hainan, where more than 70% of the woodland has been lost in the past 50 years due to shifting cultivation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> wood for fuel during Chinese government re-settlement programmes.|$|E
