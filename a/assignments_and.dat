5|$|Chaffee {{was given}} a variety of <b>assignments,</b> <b>and</b> participated in {{numerous}} training duties {{over the next few}} years, spending {{most of his time in}} photo reconnaissance squadrons. He was stationed at NAS Jacksonville as safety officer and quality control officer for Heavy Photographic Squadron 62 (VAP-62) flying the A3D. He wrote a quality control manual for the squadron, although some of his peers saw this as too demanding. By coincidence, he was assigned to a mission where he flew over Cape Canaveral, during which aerial photographs of future launch sites were taken.|$|E
5|$|Civilian Public Service {{men were}} {{released}} from their <b>assignments</b> <b>and</b> the camps closed during March 1947, nineteen {{months after the}} end of the war in the Pacific.

Daigo's former classmate Yamashita (Tetta Sugimoto) insists that the mortician find a more respectable line of work and, until then, avoids him and his family.|$|E

5|$|Born in Hong Kong, Kaif and {{her family}} lived in several {{countries}} before she moved to London. She received her first modelling assignment as a teenager and later pursued {{a career as a}} fashion model. At a fashion show in London, filmmaker Kaizad Gustad spotted Kaif and decided to cast her in Boom (2003), a critical and commercial failure. While filming in India, Kaif received modelling <b>assignments</b> <b>and</b> established a successful modelling career. However, filmmakers were hesitant to cast her due to her poor command of Hindi. After appearing in the Telugu film, Malliswari (2004), Kaif earned commercial success in Bollywood with the romantic comedies Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya? (2005) and Namastey London (2007). She followed with a series of box-office hits, but was criticised for her acting, repetitive roles and inclination to male-dominated films.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the prime}} opponents of Wilson and the League was Senate Majority Leader Henry Cabot Lodge. After McNary {{demonstrated}} his skill {{in the debate over}} the League, Lodge took him under his wing, and the two formed a longtime friendship. The friendship helped McNary secure favorable committee <b>assignments</b> <b>and</b> ushered him into the inner power circle of the Senate. Early in his career, he served as chairman of the Irrigation and Reclamation of Arid Lands Committee, and {{as a member of the}} Agriculture and Forestry Committee. In 1922, President Warren G. Harding asked McNary to be the Secretary of the Interior to replace Albert B. Fall because of Fall's involvement in the ongoing Teapot Dome scandal. McNary declined, preferring to stay in the Senate.|$|E

5|$|The Flames were {{inundated}} with complaints from season ticket holders upset by their seat <b>assignments</b> <b>and</b> {{the cost of}} tickets. King responded to the concerns by noting that the league had purchased the game from the Flames, and the team was given a limited allotment of seats for its ticket holders. He also noted {{that it was possible}} that the event would lose money, even at ticket prices ranging between $49 and $249, but that the team brought the Heritage Classic to Calgary because the fans wanted the game to return to Canada. The Pittsburgh Penguins and Buffalo Sabres encountered similar issues allocating tickets for the Winter Classic.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{has been}} {{studying}} a freeway upgrade for US131 through St. Joseph County for several years. In late 2005, MDOT decided not to pursue an upgrade of the highway, but rescinded that decision in April 2006 under political pressure in the state. The department began building a two-lane bypass west of Constantine. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, which {{is in charge of}} US Highway numbering <b>assignments</b> <b>and</b> routings, approved the relocation of the US 131 designation out of Constantine on November 16, 2012. The group's Special Committee on U.S. Route Numbering also approved the creation of a business route for the old highway through town. The bypass opened on October 30, 2013, and the business route designation was put into service that day.|$|E
5|$|Weaver {{entered the}} 46th Congress in March 1879. Although the House was closely divided, neither major party {{included}} the Greenbackers in its caucus, leaving them few committee <b>assignments</b> <b>and</b> little input on legislation. Weaver gave his first speech in April 1879, criticizing {{the use of}} the army to police Southern polling stations, while also decrying the violence against black Southerners that made such protection necessary; he then described the Greenback platform, which he said would {{put an end to the}} sectional and economic strife. The next month, he spoke in favor of a bill calling for an increase in the money supply by allowing the unlimited coinage of silver, but the bill was easily defeated. Weaver's oratorical skill drew praise, and while he was unable to advance Greenback policy ideas, he was soon considered the front-runner for the presidential nomination in 1880.|$|E

5|$|James A. Seddon {{resigned}} {{his position}} as the Confederate Secretary of War on January 19, 1865. On February 6, Davis appointed Breckinridge to the vacant position, partially to quiet growing opposition to his administration. Initially opposed by {{several members of the}} Confederate Congress because he had waited to join the Confederacy, he eventually gained their support by administrating his office more efficiently than his predecessors. With their support, he was able to expand the post's influence to include making officer <b>assignments</b> <b>and</b> promotion recommendations and advising field generals regarding strategy. His first act as secretary was to promote Robert E. Lee to general-in-chief of all Confederate forces. After Lee reported a critical shortage of food, clothing, and supplies among his troops, Breckinridge recommended the removal of Lucius B. Northrop, the Confederate commissary general. Northrop's successor, Isaac M. St. John, improved the flow of supplies to troops in the field.|$|E
5|$|Madhavan has {{appeared}} as host for television programmes on Hindi channels, {{while he has}} also been a host at film award functions. During his television career in the 1990s, Madhavan first worked as a host on Tol Mol Ke Bol. He was announced as the host of Sony Entertainment Television's Deal Ya No Deal, the Indian version of the American game show Deal Or No Deal, in October 2005. However, Madhavan quit as the lead anchor of the show in January 2006 claiming he was unhappy with the way the shoot schedules were handled by the production house. According to the actor, when he took on the show, he had {{made it clear that he}} would continue with his South Indian film <b>assignments,</b> <b>and</b> as the show was being filmed in Mumbai, he had found it hard to keep travelling throughout India from Chennai to film the ten days a month he had signed up for. Madhavan added that he was restricted by the producers to spend one day rehearsing technically, which left him with fatigue. Mandira Bedi subsequently replaced Madhavan as the anchor in February for Series 2 of the game show. In June 2010, Madhavan made a comeback to the game show format by accepting a contract with Imagine TV's Big Money show, signing on to host a single season, and then hosted an episode of the crime show Savdhaan India in January 2016. Furthermore, he has been a guest judge in the Indian television show, Fame Gurukul. In 2016, Madhavan stated that he would only take part in television commitments for money, while he does not consider his payment when signing on to appear in films. Madhavan has also hosted live events, notably the National Film Awards in 2013 with Huma Qureshi. He was also the host of the 55th Filmfare Awards South in Chennai in 2008 and then also the Vijay Awards in 2013.|$|E
