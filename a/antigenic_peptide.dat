25|$|Diversity of antigen presentation, {{mediated}} by MHC classes I and II, is attained {{in at least}} three ways: (1) an organism's MHC repertoire is polygenic (via multiple, interacting genes); (2) MHC expression is codominant (from both sets of inherited alleles); (3) MHC gene variants are highly polymorphic (diversely varying from organism to organism within a species). Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection has been observed in male mice making mate choices of females with different MHCs and thus demonstrating sexual selection.

40|$|MHC class I {{molecules}} bind to <b>antigenic</b> <b>peptides</b> in the {{endoplasmic reticulum}} (ER), and present {{themselves on the}} cell surface. MHC class I-bound <b>antigenic</b> <b>peptides</b> are produced by proteasomal degradation of cytosolic or nuclear proteins, followed by their translocation into the ER. The peptide translocation is mediated by transporters associated with antigen processing (TAP 1 and TAP 2). TAP 1 and TAP 2 {{are members of the}} ATP-binding cassette family of membrane transporters. Since the repertoire of <b>antigenic</b> <b>peptides</b> translocated into the ER largely depends on the efficiency and peptide selectivity of TAP, the functional analysis of TAP is important for characterizing MHC class I-bound <b>antigenic</b> <b>peptides.</b> Using a permiabilized cell system, we analyzed optimal conditions for TAP-dependent translocation of four synthetic model peptides in T 1 cells or RMA cells. It was revealed that each peptide had distinct kinetics of translocation and distinct optimal ATP concentration.

40|$|Understanding the {{processes}} that shape the genetic structure of parasite populations and the functional consequences of different parasite genotypes is critical for our ability to predict how an infection can spread through a host population and {{for the design of}} effective vaccines to combat infection and disease. Here, we examine how the genetic structure of parasite populations responds to host genetic heterogeneity. We consider the well-characterized molecular specificity of major histocompatibility complex binding of <b>antigenic</b> <b>peptides</b> to derive deterministic and stochastic models. We use these models to ask, firstly, what conditions favour the evolution of generalist parasite genotypes versus specialist parasite genotypes? Secondly, can parasite genotypes coexist in a population? We find that intragenomic interactions between parasite loci encoding <b>antigenic</b> <b>peptides</b> are pivotal in determining the outcome of evolution. Where parasite loci interact synergistically (i. e. the recognition of additional <b>antigenic</b> <b>peptides</b> has a disproportionately large effect on parasite fitness), generalist parasite genotypes are favoured. Where parasite loci act multiplicatively (have independent effects on fitness) or antagonistically (have diminishing effects on parasite fitness), specialist parasite genotypes are favoured.

50|$|The {{centerpiece}} of each tetramer is a streptavidin complex. Streptavidin is a molecule that forms homotetramer complexes, with each monomer having {{an unusually high}} affinity for biotin. Exploiting these facts, scientists have bioengineered E. coli to produce soluble MHC molecules with a biotinylation protein domain, meaning {{a part of the}} MHC can be replaced by covalently bound biotin (via BirA enzyme activity). The MHC molecules must then be mixed with the <b>antigenic</b> <b>peptide</b> of interest, forming peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes. The biotinylated domain then allows for up to 4 pMHCs to bind to a fluorescently tagged streptavidin complex with high affinity. The resulting pMHC-streptavidin-fluorophore tetramer can be added to a sample of cells. The tetramers bind to T-cells that are specific for both the MHC type and peptide being used in the tetramer. Once the tetramers are bound, T-cells are often stained with other fluorophores and the sample is washed to remove non-bound tetramers and ligands. The stained sample is then run through a flow cytometer for detection and sorting. The fluorophore on any bound tetramers can be excited to give a signal, indicating that the tetramer is bound to a T-cell, and thus that the bound T-cell is specific for the peptide antigen of interest. Ultimately, a signal means that there exists some cell-mediated immune response to the pathogen from which the <b>antigenic</b> <b>peptide</b> is derived, and the strength of the signal gives the strength of the immune response.|$|E
40|$|The {{transporter}} {{associated with}} antigen processing (TAP) selectively translocates <b>antigenic</b> <b>peptides</b> into the endoplasmic reticulum.

Its pivotal role predestines TAP as a target for infectious diseases and malignant disorders. The development of therapies or drugs therefore requires a detailed comprehension of structure and function of this ABC transporter, but our knowledge about various aspects is still insufficient. This review highlights recent achievements on the structure and dynamics of <b>antigenic</b> <b>peptides</b> in complex with TAP.

During the manufacture of these antibodies, antigen specific antibodies are sequestered by attaching the <b>antigenic</b> <b>peptide</b> to an affinity column and allowing nonspecific antibody to simply pass through the column.

50|$|TSST-1 binds {{primarily}} to the alpha-chain of class II MHC exclusively through a low-affinity (or generic) binding site on the SAG N-terminal domain. This is opposed to other super antigens (SAGs) such as DEA and SEE, that bind to class II MHC through the low-affinity site, and to the beta-chain through a high-affinity site. This high-affinity site is a zinc-dependent site on the SAG C-terminal domain. When this site is bound, it extends over part of the binding groove, makes contacts with the bound peptide,and then binds regions of both the alpha and beta chains. MHC-binding by TSST-1 is partially peptide-dependent. Mutagenesis studies with SEA have indicated that both binding sites are required for optimal T-cell activation. These studies containing TSST-1 indicate that the TCR binding domain lies {{at the top of}} the back side of this toxin, though the complete interaction remains to be determined. There have also been indications that the TCR binding site of TSST-1 is mapped to the major groove of the central alpha helix or the short amino terminal alpha helix. Residues in the beta claw motif of TSST-1 are known to interact primarily with the invariant region of the Alpha chain of this MHC class II molecule. Residues forming minor contacts with TSST-1 were also identified in the HLA-DR1 β-chain, as well as the <b>antigenic</b> <b>peptide,</b> located in the interchain groove.

40|$|The {{proteasome}} {{plays an}} essential role in the production of MHC class I-restricted antigenic peptides.

In this study, we have developed a solid-phase peptidase assay that allowed us to efficiently purify and immobilize proteasome, tripeptidyl peptidase II, and puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase.

Using three distinct <b>antigenic</b> <b>peptide</b> precursors, we found that tripeptidyl peptidase II never cleaved within the <b>antigenic</b> <b>peptide</b> sequence, suggesting that, aside from its proteolytic activities, it may also play a role in protecting antigenic peptides from complete hydrolysis in the cytosol.

After optimizing the factors for fluorescence polarization (FP) immunoassay, the antigenicities of synthetic peptides were determined by analyzing the recognition and combination of peptides and standard antibody samples.

In order to screen dominant <b>antigenic</b> <b>peptides,</b> the FP assays were carried out to investigate the antibodies against the 10 synthetic peptides of HBV surface antigen respectively in 159 samples of anti-HBV surface antigen-positive antiserum. The results showed that 3 of the 10 <b>antigenic</b> <b>peptides</b> may be immunodominant because the antibodies against them existed more widely among the samples and their antibody titers were {{higher than those of}} other peptides.
