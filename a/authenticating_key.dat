30|$|In {{the secure}} channel {{establishment}} stage, a secure channel is established between V_i and R_j. Essentially, {{it is an}} anonymous one-pass <b>authenticated</b> <b>key</b> agreement protocol. A one-pass <b>authenticated</b> <b>key</b> agreement protocol requires only one entity {{to send a message}} to another entity. The secure channel can be established with a short delay. The one-pass <b>authenticated</b> <b>key</b> agreement protocol used in this paper is derived from the protocol in [37], which has been proven to be secure. Furthermore, in the one-pass <b>authenticated</b> <b>key</b> agreement protocol, the anonymous certificate is used to hide V_i&#x 2019;s identity, and the position information of V_i is sent through the secure channel. In addition, in the key agreement protocol, we use a nonce generator NG and a hedged extractor HE to generate the randomness. Thus, as shown in [40], this anonymous one-pass <b>authenticated</b> <b>key</b> agreement protocol is secured against backdoored pseudorandom generators. Therefore, the authentication and vehicle privacy properties are guaranteed.|$|R
