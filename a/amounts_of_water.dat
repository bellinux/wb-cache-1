40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to clarify the optimum number <b>of</b> <b>watering</b> plants per porous pipe from the point <b>of</b> the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> supply under the sub-irrigation method of using {{negative}} pressure difference. Because the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> supply per a porous pipe was estimated to vary with the number <b>of</b> <b>watering</b> plants. Then, two experiment conditions were set up and experiments were conducted to clarify the total <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> supply and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>watering</b> plants in each growing stage under the cultivation of two melon plants and four melon plants. Consequently, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> supply per porous pipe was clarified to vary with the number <b>of</b> <b>watering</b> plants. That is, the total <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> supply needed in case <b>of</b> <b>watering</b> two plants {{was found to be}} more than in case <b>of</b> <b>watering</b> four plants. However, {{the quantity and quality of}} the fruits were hardly different in both cases...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, three typical {{test methods}} for thermal {{efficiency}} of biomass stoves were discussed. The effect {{factors such as}} operation process, test ending time, pot sizes, <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> on the thermal efficiency of domestic biomass cookstoves were studied. The {{results show that the}} test ending time and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> used have major impacts on thermal efficiency. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> is in positive correlation with the thermal efficiency of the stove (R= 0. 92) when the heat needed for the selected <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> is less than actual power output of stoves. The thermal efficiency is more controllable and accurate when the test ending time is 2 ℃ lower than the boiling point and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> is selected according to the actual power output of stoves...|$|R
50|$|Although it {{may seem}} paradoxical, {{the use of a}} strong flow with an {{efficient}} fire hose and an efficient strategy (diffuse spray, small droplets) requires a smaller <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> This is because once the temperature is lowered, only a limited <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> is necessary to suppress the fire seat with a straight spray. For a living room of 50 m2, the required <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> is estimated as 60 L (15 gal).|$|R
5|$|Balaenopterids are the rorquals. These animals, {{along with}} the cetotheriids, rely on their throat pleats to gulp large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> while feeding. The throat pleats extend from the mouth to the navel and allow the mouth to expand to a large volume for more {{efficient}} capture of the small animals they feed on. Balaenopterids consist of two genera and eight species.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves filter large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> to {{feed and}} breathe {{but they are not}} {{permanently}} open. They regularly shut their valves to enter a resting state, even when they are permanently submerged. In oysters, for example, their behaviour follows very strict circatidal and circadian rhythms according to the relative positions of the moon and sun. During neap tides, they exhibit much longer closing periods than during spring tides.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} pressure on Earth's surface averages 101.325kPa, with a scale height of about 8.5km. It has a composition of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, with trace <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> vapor, carbon dioxide, and other gaseous molecules. The {{height of the}} troposphere varies with latitude, ranging between 8km at the poles to 17km at the equator, with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{irrigation}} systems as an optimal control problem, where the trajectory is {{the water in}} the soil and the control is the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> introduced in the soil via irrigation.

5|$|Two related {{processes}} for the carbonylation of methanol: the rhodium-catalyzed Monsanto process, and the iridium-catalyzed Cativa process. The latter process is greener {{and more efficient}} and has largely supplanted the former process, often in the same production plants. Catalytic <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> are used in both processes, but the Cativa process requires less, so the water-gas shift reaction is suppressed, and fewer by-products are formed.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 {{an island}} {{was found in}} {{the central part of the}} lake. Then, in January 2006, the {{discovery}} of two nearby smaller lakes under the ice cap was published; they are named 90 Degrees East and Sovetskaya. It is suspected that these Antarctic subglacial lakes may be connected by a network of subglacial rivers. Centre for Polar Observation & Modelling glaciologists propose that many of the subglacial lakes of Antarctica are at least temporarily interconnected. Because of varying water pressure in individual lakes, large subsurface rivers may suddenly form and then force large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> through the solid ice.|$|E
5|$|In years since, {{signatures}} of water {{have been found}} to exist on the lunar surface. In 1994, the bistatic radar experiment located on the Clementine spacecraft, indicated the existence of small, frozen pockets of water close to the surface. However, later radar observations by Arecibo, suggest these findings may rather be rocks ejected from young impact craters. In 1998, the neutron spectrometer on the Lunar Prospector spacecraft showed that high concentrations of hydrogen are present in the first meter of depth in the regolith near the polar regions. Volcanic lava beads, brought back to Earth aboard Apollo 15, showed small <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in their interior.|$|E

40|$|Partial rootzone drying (PRD) is an {{irrigation}} {{management technique}} {{designed to reduce}} water use in grapevines without a decline in yield, thereby increasing water use efficiency (WUE). Experiments consisted of field-grown Cabernet Sauvignon, where the PRD grapevines were irrigated with half the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> as control grapevines, and Shiraz, where the PRD grapevines received the same <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> as control grapevines. PRD treatments showed {{no significant differences in}} yield or berry composition at harvest, except that PRD grapevines that received half the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> had significantly smaller berries than control grapevines. Cabernet Sauvignon PRD grapevines receiving half the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> as control grapevines showed a 34 % reduction in main shoot growth and up to a 74 % reduction in lateral shoot growth. Shoot growth was inhibited to a lesser extent in Shiraz PRD grapevines receiving the same <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> with a 20 % reduction in main shoot growth and a 33 % reduction in lateral shoot growth. PRD also significantly reduced stomatal conductance in Cabernet Sauvignon on average by 31 % and 16 % in Shiraz. Nitrate reductase (NR) activity in grapevine leaves was significantly lowered in response to PRD, irrespective <b>of</b> the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> applied. The reduction in NR activity was closely correlated with the development of the PRD cycle and the associated reduction in stomatal conductance...|$|R
5|$|Precipitation, {{especially}} rain, has {{a dramatic}} effect on agriculture. All plants {{need at least}} some water to survive, therefore rain (being {{the most effective means}} of watering) is important to agriculture. While a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy plants, {{too much or too little}} rainfall can be harmful, even devastating to crops. Drought can kill crops and increase erosion, while overly wet weather can cause harmful fungus growth. Plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive. For example, certain cacti require small <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive.|$|E
5|$|Fierce waves pushed large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> to {{coastal areas}} in Fujairah of the United Arab Emirates, forcing roads {{to be closed}} and traffic diverted. Civil defence and police were on duty to manage the road closures, while {{municipal}} workers pumped the excess water off the roads. The road connecting Kalba and Fujairah was closed due to the road being submerged by water. The waves along the coastline were reported to be 10m (32ft) high, which destroyed about a dozen fishing boats. About 300boats were moved from the water or emptied of equipment, and overall damage to the port of Fujairah was reported as severe. A boat sank by the port, leaving its ten passengers missing.|$|E

5|$|Imperatritsa Mariya {{proved to}} be very bow-heavy in service and tended to ship large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> through her forward casemates. The {{ammunition}} for the forward 12-inch guns was reduced from 100 to 70 rounds each while the 130mm ammunition was reduced from 245 to 100 rounds per gun {{in an attempt to}} compensate for her trim. This did not fully cure the problem, but Imperatritsa Mariya was lost before any other changes could be implemented. This did not fully cure the problem so Volias, as she was known by then, forward pair of 130mm guns were removed while she was fitting out. Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya did not suffer from the same degree of trim by the bow by virtue of her greater size and retained her forward guns.|$|E
5|$|Most spiders convert {{nitrogenous}} {{waste products}} into uric acid, {{which can be}} excreted as a dry material. Malphigian tubules ("little tubes") extract these wastes from the blood in the hemocoel and dump them into the cloacal chamber, from which they are expelled through the anus. Production of uric acid and its removal via Malphigian tubules are a water-conserving feature that has evolved independently in several arthropod lineages that can live far away from water, for example the tubules of insects and arachnids develop from completely {{different parts of the}} embryo. However, a few primitive spiders, the sub-order Mesothelae and infra-order Mygalomorphae, retain the ancestral arthropod nephridia ("little kidneys"), which use large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> to excrete nitrogenous waste products as ammonia.|$|E
5|$|The early Archaic {{people living}} near Mesa Verde {{utilized}} the atlatl and harvested {{a wider variety}} of plants and animals than the Paleo-Indians had, while retaining their primarily nomadic lifestyle. They inhabited the outlying areas of the Mesa Verde region, but also the mountains, mesa tops, and canyons, where they created rockshelters and rock art, and left evidence of animal processing and chert knapping. Environmental stability during the period drove population expansion and migration. Major warming and drying from 5000 to 2500 might have led middle Archaic people to seek the cooler climate of Mesa Verde, whose higher elevation brought increased snowpack that, when coupled with spring rains, provided relatively plentiful <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
30|$|Firstly, {{the system}} {{is assumed to be}} {{partially}} open only for the H 2 O component, and we assume that the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> infiltration dm_ H_ 2 O is an input parameter. In Kuwatani et al. (2011), dM^Water was used as an output-dependent parameter to monitor the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> production by dehydration reactions. In this study, we assume that the free water that infiltrates {{the system is}} immediately fixed within equilibrated hydrous minerals, such that dM^Water = 0, which results in the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> always being zero (M^Water = 0). In other words, dm_ H_ 2 O is regarded as the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> consumption by rehydration reactions. This assumption is considered to be valid with respect to retrograde metamorphism according to previous kinetic experiments (Yardley et al. 2014) and natural observations, as discussed above.|$|R

5|$|The {{water quality}} of the Little Applegate River {{watershed}} is generally poor due to high temperatures, sedimentation, and oxygen saturation levels which occur throughout the region. Most of these problems are created by human activity; forests and riparian zones have been cleared {{to make way for}} agriculture, and high road densities cause slope failures. Hydraulic mining near Sterlingville devastated the surrounding landscape, leaving the slopes bare and sending rocks and gravel downstream. Cattle and sheep were introduced to the area in the late 19th century; they have since overgrazed some areas of the watershed, reducing native grasses and allowing noxious weeds to spread. Overgrazing also contributes to soil erosion.

5|$|Most of the gyromitrin must {{be removed}} to render false morels edible. The {{recommended}} procedure involves either first drying and then boiling the mushrooms, or boiling the fresh mushrooms directly. To prepare fresh mushroom {{it is recommended that}} they are cut into small pieces and parboiled twice in copious <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> at least three parts water to one part chopped mushrooms, for at least five minutes, after each boiling the mushroom should be rinsed thoroughly in clean water. Each round of parboiling reduces the gyromitrin contents to a tenth. The gyromitrin is leached into the water where it will remain, therefore the parboiling water must be discarded and replaced with fresh water after each round of boiling. Drying the mushrooms can also reduce the concentration of gyromitrin; ten days of open air desiccation leads to the loss of 90% of gyromitrin. However it is still recommended that the mushroom be boiled after drying.|$|E

The French crew panicked as the storm began, and refused to attend to the sails or even close the hatches: as a result the vessel almost founded as huge <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> poured into the ship. In desperation, Hamelin called Captain Stewart to his cabin and requested that his men save the ship but demanded that Stewart give his word that his men would not attempt to escape or seize the frigate.
