5|$|In {{its first}} {{election}} campaign in 1984, BSP fielded Mayawati for the Lok Sabha (Lower House) seat of Kairana in the Muzaffarnagar district, for Bijnor in 1985, and for Haridwar in 1987. In 1989 she was elected as the representative for Bijnor, with 183,189 votes, winning by 8,879 votes. Although BSP {{did not win}} control of the house, the electoral experience led to considerable activity for Mayawati {{over the next five}} years, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>worked</b> with Mahsood Ahmed and other organisers. The party won three seats in the 1989 national election and two seats 1991.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Saydel High School in 1983, Robinson {{spent the summer}} {{deciding}} on her career path <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>worked</b> as a department store cashier. She went with her father to help him promote local races. Robinson persuaded him to let her compete in racing, and started off at Toledo Speedway driving a 1976 International semi-tractor. She participated in a five-lap sprint race where she finished second after leading for four laps, and took third position in the feature event. After this Robinson began racing full-time, and won 30 feature races {{before moving to the}} super-speedway division in April 1984; she faced early resentment from her male competitors. In the same year, Robinson moved from Iowa to Pennsylvania. Lefty believed Robinson's presence helped to increase fans' interest. Robinson's father acted as her mentor although her mother was against her racing because she felt she would be hurt in a crash.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} scene, Odysseus threatens the sorceress with a drawn sword, as Homer {{describes}} it. However, he is sometimes depicted carrying spears as well, {{as in the}} Athens lekythos, while Homer reports {{that it was a}} bow he had slung over his shoulder. In this episode Circe is generally shown in flight, and on the Erlangen lekythos can clearly be seen dropping the bowl and wand behind her. Two curiously primitive wine bowls incorporate the Homeric detail of Circe's handloom, at which the men approaching her palace could hear her singing sweetly <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>worked.</b> In the 5th century skyphos from Boeotia an apparently crippled Odysseus leans on a crutch while a woman with negroid features holds out a disproportionately large bowl. In the other, a pot-bellied hero brandishes a sword while Circe stirs her potion. Both these may depict the scene as represented in one or other of the comic satyr plays which deal with their encounter. Little remains of these now beyond a few lines by Aeschylus, Ephippus of Athens and Anaxilas. Other vase paintings from the period suggest that Odysseus' half-transformed animal-men formed the chorus in place of the usual satyrs. The reason that it should be a subject of such plays is that wine drinking was often central to their plot. Later writers were to follow Socrates in interpreting the episode as illustrating the dangers of drunkenness.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé's vocals were {{recorded}} at the KMA Studio in New York City. When the trio played Beyoncé the demo of [...] "Best Thing I Never Had", she immediately approved it after making slight modifications. Smith says that Beyoncé was literally {{jumping up and}} down after hearing the demo. One hour later Beyoncé recorded [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] and two other songs. Smith recalled that Beyoncé focused solely on the recording, ignoring hunger <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>worked</b> into the night. Beyoncé has stated that every man and woman can relate to the song's subject matter because at one point, almost everyone ends a relationship because of lack of commitment by his or her partner.|$|E
500|$|Between 1935 and 1940 Akhmatova composed, {{worked and}} {{reworked}} the long poem Requiem in secret, a lyrical cycle of lamentation and witness, depicting {{the suffering of}} the common people under Soviet terror. She carried it with her <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>worked</b> and lived in towns and cities across the Soviet Union. It was conspicuously absent from her collected works, given its explicit condemnation of the purges. The work in Russian finally appeared in book form in Munich in 1963, the whole work not published within USSR until 1987. It consists of ten numbered poems that examine a series of emotional states, exploring suffering, despair, devotion, rather than a clear narrative. Biblical themes such as Christ's crucifixion and the devastation of Mary, Mother of Jesus and Mary Magdelene, reflect the ravaging of Russia, particularly witnessing the harrowing of women in the 1930s. It represented, to some degree, a rejection of her own earlier romantic work as she took on the public role as chronicler of the Terror. [...] This is a role she holds to this day.|$|E

500|$|Swift {{performed}} [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] on all venues of {{her first}} headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour, which extended from April 2009 to June 2010. The performances of [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] set on a small platform located at the opposite end, parallel to the stage in the arena. Swift, dressed in a pastel sundress, sat on a wooden stool while performing with wooden acoustic guitar strapped to her shoulder. Swift then completed the performance standing and {{walking back to the}} main stage. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>worked</b> her way back to the stage, she again hugged fans, squeezed their outstretched hands and scrawled quick autographs. Nicole Frehsee of Rolling Stone favored Swift's performance of [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] at the August 27, 2009, concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Frehsee described the entire concert as an [...] "elaborate spectacle that doesn't slow down, even when the singer hauls her acoustic guitar into the audience to play a sweet, stripped down set of tunes including [...] 'Tim McGraw'." [...] Brandy McDonnel of The Oklahoman reported a massive sing-along by the audience at the March 31, 2010, concert at the Ford Center in Oklahoma City [...] Molly Trust of Billboard attended the performance at the tour's final concert on June 5, 2010, at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts and conjectured that the performance's setting was formed in order to [...] "afford a better view to fans farther back." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 16, she got a lucky break {{because of}} {{a visit to a}} podiatrist. The doctor had an office at Broadway and 42nd Street, in what had been a fashionable Knickerbocker Hotel suite in the early 1900s, the New York {{residence}} of opera singer Enrico Caruso (1873–1921). So the doctor would often entertain visitors who were there to see the Caruso memorabilia. While she herself was at the office, November met another patient who had contacts in the music industry, and she sang an impromptu audition. The patient was impressed, and put her in touch with one of his contacts, manager Gus Schirmer (of the Schirmer Music publishing family), who was looking for [...] "pretty sopranos" [...] for his summer musicals. Schirmer introduced her to Broadway composer Richard Rodgers, who became her mentor, and through Schirmer, November also auditioned for other producers such as Lawrence Kasha. She obtained work as a performer in the 1963 summer musical season in Dallas, Texas, but despite many auditions, could never land a job in Broadway theatre (according to November, this was because she never had the exact look that a particular show was looking for). [...] Then Schirmer got her a job singing at an industrial musical for Ford Motor Company, where she met many other successful musicians, singers, and composers such as Ray Charles. He began incorporating her into sessions with the Ray Charles Singers, a group of performers with a rotating membership that would sing in close harmonies, often on productions with singer and television personality Perry Como, or as backup singers for other recordings. This launched November's career as a studio singer, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>worked</b> on a contract basis for many different productions. From 1962 to 1967 November would rotate in and out as part of the Ray Charles Singers, sometimes seen on Perry Como's Kraft Music Hall variety program. She can also be heard as a backup singer on some Frank Sinatra recordings, such as the soprano voice in the background of the 1967 song, [...] "The World We Knew".|$|E

During the early 1960s she left her husband and began traveling and performing at music festivals and clubs throughout the United States.

2500|$|Kelley's views became {{progressively}} more radical <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>worked</b> with abolitionists such as Angelina Grimké. [...] She became an “ultra”, advocating {{not only the}} abolition of slavery, but also full civil equality for blacks. [...] In addition, Garrison's influence led her to adopt the position of “non-resistance", which went beyond opposing war to opposing all forms of government coercion. [...] Radical abolitionists led by Garrison refused to serve on juries, join the military, or vote. [...] The Garrisonian call {{for the end of}} slavery and the extension of civil rights to African Americans caused controversy. [...] Kelley's advocacy of the radical abolitionist movement prompted some opponents to call her a “Jezebel", as what she proposed threatened their sense of social structure. [...] On the other hand, many fellow abolitionists praised her public speaking skills and her dedication to the cause. [...] Kelley’s influence was shown by activist women being called “Abby Kelleyites". [...] Radical abolitionism became known as “Abby Kelleyism.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1964, Schneemann began {{production}} of her film Fuses, eventually finishing it in 1967. [...] Fuses portrayed Schneemann and her then-boyfriend James Tenney having sex as recorded by a 16 mm Bolex camera. [...] Schneemann then altered the film by staining, burning, and directly {{drawing on the}} celluloid itself, mixing the concepts of painting and collage. [...] The segments were edited together at varying speeds and superimposed with photographs of nature, which she juxtaposed against her and Tenney's bodies and sexual actions. [...] Fuses was motivated by Schneemann's desire to know if a woman's depiction of her own sexual acts was different from pornography and classical art {{as well as a}} reaction to Stan Brakhage's Loving (1957), Cat's Cradle (1959) and Window Water Baby Moving (1959). [...] She showed the film to her contemporaries <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>worked</b> on it in 1965 and 1966, receiving mostly positive feedback from her peers. [...] Many critics though described it as [...] "narcissistic exhibitionism" [...] and described it as self-indulgent. [...] She received an especially strong reaction regarding the cunnilingus scene of the film. [...] While Fuses is viewed as a [...] "proto-feminist" [...] film, Schneemann feels that it was largely neglected by feminist film historians. [...] The film lacked the fetishism and objectification of the female body as seen in much male-oriented pornography. [...] Two years after its completion, it won a Cannes Film Festival Special Jury Selection prize. [...] Pop artist Andy Warhol, with whom Schneemann was acquainted, having spent time at The Factory, drolly remarked that Schneemann should have taken the film to Hollywood. Fuses became the first in Carolee Schneemann's Autobiographical Trilogy. [...] Though her works of the 1960s such as this shared many of the same ideas with the concurrent Fluxus artists, she remained independent of any specific movement. [...] They did, however, form the groundwork for the feminist art movement of the late 1960s and 1970s. [...] Schneemann points out that the sexuality of the film overrides its formal and structural aspects to many viewers.|$|E
