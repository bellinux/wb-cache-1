5|$|Babenberg was {{the last}} of three battleships of her class. Her keel was laid down on 19 January 1901 at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{shipyard}} in Trieste. Following <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half of construction, she was launched on 4 October 1902. After final fitting-out work was completed, the ship was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian fleet on 15 April 1904.|$|E

5|$|Development took <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half, {{with the}} team aiming for as much realism as possible. Certain features, {{including}} multiplayer, were dropped. Over 15 million copies were sold, and ports for various games consoles were released, most in 1995. Theme Park received generally positive reviews. Reviewers praised the gameplay and humour, but criticised console ports for reasons such as lack of save or mouse support. The game received a Japanese localisation (in addition to normal Japanese releases), Shin Theme Park, released in 1997 for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation, and remakes for the Nintendo DS and iOS, released in 2007 and 2011 respectively. Theme Hospital is Bullfrog's thematic successor to the game, and two direct sequels followed: Theme Park World (known as Sim Theme Park in some territories) and Theme Park Inc (also known as SimCoaster).|$|E
5|$|Whilst Valiant {{was under}} construction, Westwood, Baillie went {{bankrupt}} in November 1861 and their shipyard {{was taken over}} by the Thames Ironworks. This delayed her launching by <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> shortage of muzzle-loading guns delayed her completion by nearly five years. Hector, in contrast, served with the Channel Fleet from commissioning until 1867, when she was paid off to be re-armed and to refit. She formed part of the Southern Reserve Fleet between 1868 until 1886 much like Valiants service as the First Reserve guard ship in Southern Ireland after her commissioning, where she remained until 1885. Both ships did little of significance until they were assigned to the Particular Service Squadron, commanded by Admiral Geoffrey Hornby, from June to August 1878 during the Russian war scare during the Russo-Turkish War.|$|E

25|$|Granger was in New York when he {{was summoned}} to return to Hollywood and discuss Rope with Hitchcock. The night before their initial meeting, Granger coincidentally met Arthur Laurents, who had written the film's screenplay, {{which was based on}} the play Rope's End, a fictionalized account of the Leopold and Loeb murder case. It was not until he began reading the script that he {{connected}} its author with the man he had met the previous night. Granger and Laurents met again, and Laurents invited the actor to spend the night. He declined, but when the offer was extended again several days later, he accepted.

25|$|Early in the Civil War, Halleck was {{a senior}} Union Army {{commander}} in the Western Theater. He commanded operations in the Western Theater from 1861 until 1862, during which time, while the Union armies in the east were defeated and held back, the troops under Halleck's command won many important victories. However, Halleck was not present at the battles, and his subordinates deserved most of the credit. The only operation in which Halleck exercised field command was the Siege of Corinth {{in the spring of}} 1862, a Union victory which he conducted with extreme caution. Halleck also developed rivalries with many of his subordinate generals, such as Ulysses S. Grant and Don Carlos Buell. In July 1862, following Major General George B. McClellan's failed Peninsula Campaign in the Eastern Theater, Halleck was promoted to general-in-chief of all U.S. armies. Halleck served in this capacity for <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half.|$|E
25|$|In early 1776, <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> {{half after}} his enrollment, Monroe {{dropped out of}} college and joined the 3rd Virginia Regiment in the Continental Army. As the fledgling army valued {{literacy}} in its officers, Monroe was commissioned with the rank of lieutenant, serving under Captain William Washington. After months of training, Monroe and seven hundred Virginia infantrymen were called north to serve in the New York and New Jersey campaign. Shortly after the Virginians arrived, Washington led the army in a retreat from New York City into New Jersey and then across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania. In December, Monroe took part in a surprise attack on a Hessian encampment. Though the attack was successful, Monroe suffered a severed artery in the battle and nearly died. In the aftermath of the battle, George Washington cited Monroe and William Washington for their bravery, and promoted Monroe to the rank of captain. After his wounds healed, Monroe returned to Virginia to recruit his own company of soldiers. Monroe's participation in the battle was memorialized in John Trumbull's painting, The Capture of the Hessians at Trenton, December 26, 1776, as well as Emanuel Leutze's Washington Crossing the Delaware.|$|E

25|$|Chair has {{considered}} {{a sequel to}} Shadow Complex, and had started working on development {{after the release of}} the first game. At that time, both Mustard and executives at Epic Games were considering possibilities for mobile games based on the success of spirit-based titles like Fieldrunners. Around mid-2010, about eight to nine months after the release of Shadow Complex and into the development of its sequel, Apple Inc. was preparing to announce the iPhone 4 which they said would offer enough processor power to run games using a 3D engine. Mustard got into contact with Apple with the offer to develop a game for the iPhone, and Apple allowed them to, but required to complete the title in a very short timeframe, approximately five months, as to have it ready for the iPhone release event. Because of the limited size of Chair, they could only work on one project at a time. Over one weekend, Mustard halted the development of the Shadow Complex sequel and put his team on developing Infinity Blade, which proved successful; the title had two further sequels. During this time, Mustard stated that they were stockpiling ideas for the Shadow Complex sequel after they completed Infinity Blade. Though they don't expect a sequel to perform as well as Infinity Blade, they have pledged that a sequel will be made. In a March 2016 interview, Mustard stated that the sequel's map and core game is in a playable state, but would need <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half to add art assets, enemy behavior, and other mechanics needed to polish the title.|$|E

500|$|Bahia {{was part}} of a large 1904 naval {{building}} program by Brazil. Also planned as part of this were the two [...] dreadnoughts, ten , three submarines and a submarine tender. With a design that borrowed heavily from the British [...] scout cruisers, Bahias keel was laid on 19 August 1907 in Armstrong Whitworth's Elswick, Newcastle upon Tyne yard. Construction took <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half, and she was launched on 20 January 1909. The process of fitting out pushed her completion date to 2 March 1910, after which she sailed to Brazil, arriving in Recife on 6 May. The new cruiser—the third ship of the Brazilian Navy to honor the state of Bahia—was commissioned into the navy shortly thereafter on 21 May 1910. As a class, Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul were the fastest cruisers in the world when they were commissioned, and the first in the Brazilian Navy to utilize steam turbines for propulsion.|$|E
