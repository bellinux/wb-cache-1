40|$|Cross-presentation of IgG-containing immune {{complexes}} (ICs) is {{an important}} means by which dendritic cells (DCs) activate CD 8 + T cells, yet it proceeds by an incompletely understood mechanism. We show that monocyte-derived CD 8 −CD 11 b+ DCs require the neonatal Fc receptor for IgG (FcRn) to conduct cross-presentation of IgG ICs. Consequently, {{in the absence of}} FcRn, Fcγ receptor (FcγR) -mediated antigen uptake fails to initiate cross-presentation. FcRn is shown to regulate the intracellular sorting of IgG ICs to the proper destination for such cross-presentation to occur. We demonstrate that FcRn traps antigen and protects it from degradation within an <b>acidic</b> <b>loading</b> compartment in association with the rapid recruitment of key components of the phagosome-to-cytosol cross-presentation machinery. This unique mechanism thus enables cross-presentation to evolve from an atypically <b>acidic</b> <b>loading</b> compartment. FcRn-driven cross-presentation is further shown to control cross-priming of CD 8 + T-cell responses in vivo such that during chronic inflammation, FcRn deficiency results in inadequate induction of CD 8 + T cells. These studies thus demonstrate that cross-presentation in CD 8 −CD 11 b+ DCs requires a two-step mechanism that involves FcγR-mediated internalization and FcRn-directed intracellular sorting of IgG ICs. Given the centrality of FcRn in controlling cross-presentation, these studies lay the foundation for a unique means to therapeutically manipulate CD 8 + T-cell responses...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Acid sulfate {{soils are}} weak {{mechanically}} and therefore highly erodible, if drain banks are not properly stabilised, they {{are prone to}} collapse, dumping into the drains eroded soil and sediments, which are highly acidic and loaded with heavy metals and nutrients. Low flow velocities in the drains allow iron mono-sulphides and metal oxides to accumulate due to the high iron, aluminium and other metal concentrations in drainage waters. In north Queensland, the establishment of vetiver grass {{has been shown to}} control channel bank erosion, lower frequency of drain maintenance, trap sediments in runoff water and reduce <b>acidic</b> <b>loading</b> by exposing less acid sulfate soil in the drain wall to oxidisation and leaching. A trial was established in south Queensland to demonstrate the effectiveness of vetiver hedges in water quality improvement by stabilising highly acidic drains banks and trapping nutrients, sediment, agrochemicals and cane trash.

40|$|The {{role of the}} prorenin {{receptor}} (PRR) in {{the regulation}} of ureteric bud (UB) branching morphogenesis is unknown. Here, we investigated whether PRR acts specifically in the UB to regulate UB branching, kidney development and function. We demonstrate that embryonic (E) day E 13. 5 mouse metanephroi, isolated intact E 11. 5 UBs and cultured UB cells express PRR mRNA. To study its role in UB development, we conditionally ablated PRR in the developing UB (PRR (UB-/-)) using Hoxb 7 (Cre) mice. On E 12. 5, PRR (UB-/-) mice had decreased UB branching and increased UB cell apoptosis. These defects were associated with decreased expression of Ret, Wnt 11, Etv 4 /Etv 5, and reduced phosphorylation of Erk 1 / 2 in the UB. On E 18. 5, mutants had marked kidney hypoplasia, widespread apoptosis of medullary collecting duct cells and decreased expression of Foxi 1, AE 1 and H(+) -ATPase α 4 mRNA. Ultimately, they developed occasional small cysts in medullary collecting ducts and had decreased nephron number. To test the functional consequences of these alterations, we determined the ability of PRR (UB-/-) mice to acidify and concentrate the urine on postnatal (P) day P 30. PRR (UB-/-) mice were polyuric, had lower urine osmolality and a higher urine pH following 48 hours of <b>acidic</b> <b>loading</b> with NH 4 Cl. Taken together, these data show that PRR present in the UB epithelia performs essential functions during UB branching morphogenesis and collecting duct development via control of Ret/Wnt 11 pathway gene expression, UB cell survival, activation of Erk 1 / 2, terminal differentiation and function of collecting duct cells needed for maintaining adequate water and acid-base homeostasis. We propose that mutations in PRR could possibly cause renal hypodysplasia and renal tubular acidosis in humans...|$|E

This study involved a long-term (2001 - 2006), large-scale canal water quality monitoring network (87 locations) and a field experiment at nine sites to quantify the dynamic variability of acidic pollution and its source in a coastal area with ASS in the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam. Widespread acidic pollution (pH < 5) of surface water occurred {{at the beginning of the}} rainy season, while pH of the canal water remained high (7 - 8) at the end of the rainy season and during the dry season. The study identified canal embankment deposits, made of ASS spoils from canal dredging/excavation, as the main source of acidic pollution in the surrounding canal network. The findings suggested that there was a linkage between the amount of <b>acidic</b> <b>loads</b> into canal networks and the age of the embankment deposits. The most acute pollution (pH ~ 3) occurred in canals with sluggish tidal water flow, at 1 - 2 years after the deposition of excavated spoils onto the embankments in ASS.

40|$|We {{present and}} analyze a {{nonlinear}} dynamical system modelling forest-pests interactions {{and the way}} they are affected by acidic deposition. The model includes mechanisms of carbon and nitrogen exchange between soil and vegetation, biomass decomposition and microbial mineralization, and defoliation by pest grazers, which are partially controlled by avian or mam-malian predators. Acidic deposition is assumed to directly damage vegetation, to decrease soil pH, which in turn damages roots and inhibits microbial activity, and to predispose trees to increased pest attack. All the model parameters are set to realistic values except the inflow of protons to soil and the predation mortality inflicted to the pest which are allowed to vary inside reasonable ranges. A numerical bifurcation analysis with respect to these two parameters is carried out. Five functioning modes are uncovered: (i) pest-free equilibrium; (ii) pest persist-ing at endemic equilibrium; (iii) forestpest permanent oscillations; (iv) bistable behavior with the system converging either to pest-free equilibrium or endemic pest presence in accordance with initial conditions; (v) bistable behavior with convergence to endemic pest presence or permanent oscillations depending on initial conditions.

The abundances of main elements (Si, Al, Fe, Mg, Ca, K, Na) in the < 64 μm fraction were determined by the hot aqua regia digestion method and inductively coupled plasma spectrometry. The clay mineralogy of the silt plus clay fraction was examined by X-ray diffraction after selective extraction and heating treatments. At all study sites, trioctahedral mica and chlorite were totally weathered from the silt and clay fraction (< 64 μm) of the eluvial layer, leaving behind interstratified mica-vermiculite-smectite clays. In general, the mixed-layer clay of the eluvial layer had low levels of hydroxy interlayering. Illuviated layers were characterized by hydroxy interlayered vermiculite-chlorite. The abundance of chlorite and mica was greater, and the degree of interlayering lower, in parent tills than in the overlying illuviated layers. Regardless of differences in bedrock and till geochemistry, the weathering sequence throughout the podzolized till profile was coherent at most of the sampling sites. Exceptionally, in a few profiles sampled at the totally destroyed forest site, the swelling mixed-layer clay of the eluvial layer displayed a neochloritized structure. On the basis of XRD patterns and geochemistry of the samples, it was inferred that a short-term decomposition of plagioclase had promoted, via inputs of Al-hydroxides, the transformation of mica-vermiculite-smectite to a poorly crystalline interstratification of chlorite-aluminous montmorillonite.

The acid rain was simulated with H 2 SO 4, a combination of H 2 SO 4 and HNO 3, and HNO 3 at two levels of moderate <b>acidic</b> <b>loads</b> close to the natural anthropogenic pollution levels of southern Scandinavia. The higher levels of acid applications resulted in acidification, as defined by humus chemistry. The concentrations of base cations decreased, while the concentrations of exchangeable H+, Al, and Fe increased. Humus pH decreased from 3. 83 to 3. 65. Basal respiration decreased with decreasing humus pH, and total microbial biomass, measured by substrate-induced respiration and total amount of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA), decreased slightly. An altered PLFA pattern indicated a change in the microbial community structure at the higher levels of acid applications. In general, branched fatty acids, typical of gram-positive bacteria, increased in the acid plots. PLFA analysis performed on the bacterial community growing on agar plates also showed that the relative amount of PLFA specific for gram-positive bacteria increased due to the acidification. The changed bacterial community was adapted to the more acidic environment in the acid-treated plots, even though bacterial growth rates, estimated by thymidine and leucine incorporation, decreased with pH. Fungal activity (measured as acetate incorporation into ergosterol) was not affected. This result indicates that bacteria were more affected than fungi by the acidification. The capacity of the bacterial community to utilize 95 different carbon sources was variable and only showed weak correlations to pH.

The concepts of critical loads and source-receptor (S-R) relationships provide guidance for formulating such strategies. Based on the Long-range Transboundary Air Pollutants in Northeast Asia (LTP) project, this study analyzes sulfur deposition data in order to optimize <b>acidic</b> <b>loads</b> over the three countries. The three groups involved in this study carried out a full year (2002) of sulfur deposition modeling over the geographic region spanning the three countries, using three air quality models: MM 5 -CMAQ, MM 5 -RAQM, and RAMS-CADM, employed by Chinese, Japanese, and Korean modeling groups, respectively. Each model employed its own meteorological numerical model and model parameters. Only the emission rates for SO 2 and NOx obtained from the LTP project were the common parameter used in the three models. Three models revealed some bias from dry to wet deposition, particularly the latter because of the bias in annual precipitation. This finding points to the need for further sensitivity tests of the wet removal rates in association with underlying cloud-precipitation physics and parameterizations. Despite this bias, the annual total (dry plus wet) sulfur deposition predicted by the models were surprisingly very similar. The ensemble average annual total deposition was 7, 203. 6 +/- 370 kt S with a minimal mean fractional error (MFE) of 8. 95 +/- 5. 24 % and a pattern correlation (PC) of 0. 89 - 0. 93 between the models. This exercise revealed that despite rather poor error scores in comparison with observations, these consistent total deposition values across the three models, based on LTP group's input data assumptions, suggest a plausible S-R relationship that {{can be applied to the}} next task of designing cost-effective emission abatement strategies. close 3...|$|R

The methods included (1) sequential digestion of wood tissue to remove the elemental fraction that is mobile across tree rings leaving the structurally intrinsic, residual (or less mobile) ion fraction for analysis and (2) transformation of elemental concentrations into multivariate ratios (compositional nutrient diagnosis (CND)) over a time series. Sampling of trees represented a gradient in acidity resilience using three regions of southern Quebec (St. Lawrence Lowlands; Lower Laurentians; and Appalachian Highlands) and three species (red maple (Acer rubrum L.); sugar maple (Acer sacharum Marsh.); and American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.). The elemental residual fraction had differences from the mobile fraction over time for Ca, Mg and Mn, but not for K or Al. The base rich Saint-Lawrence region had the highest and slightly increasing incremental stem xylem Al of the regions yet had stable or increasing growth. By contrast the acid sensitive Appalachian region had the greatest increase in Al accompanied by a decrease in growth beyond 1970. The Appalachians also had the highest Mn, which had an adverse effect on growth of sugar maple.

40|$|Background/Aims: Glucose-stimulated insulin {{secretion}} (GSIS) of pancreatic β-cells involves glucose uptake and metabolism, {{closure of}} KATP channels and depolarization {{of the cell}} membrane potential (Vmem), activation of voltage-activated Ca 2 + currents (ICav) and influx of Ca 2 +, which eventually triggers hormone exocytosis. Beside this classical pathway, KATP-independent mechanisms such as changes in intracellular pH (pHi) or cell volume, which also affect β-cell viability, can elicit or modify insulin release. In β-cells the regulation of pHi is mainly accomplished by Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs). To investigate if other proton extrusion mechanisms than NHEs are involved in pH regulation, we tested {{for the presence of}} the non-gastric H+/K+ ATPase in rat insulinoma cells and assessed effects of the H+/K+ ATPase inhibitor SCH- 28080 on insulin secretion, cell viability and apoptosis. Methods: In INS- 1 E cell cultures, H+/K+ ATPase gene and protein expression was analyzed by reverse transcription PCR and Western blotting. Intracellular pH (pHi) recovery after acute <b>acidic</b> <b>load</b> was measured by NH 4 Cl prepulsing using BCECF. Insulin secretion was determined by ELISA from the cell culture supernatant. Vmem, K+ and Ca 2 + currents were recorded using patch clamp. Overall cell responses were determined using resazurin (viability) and cytotoxicity assays. The mean cell volume (MCV), cell granularity (side-scatter; SSC), phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, cell membrane integrity, caspase activity and the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) were measured by flow cytometry. Results: We found that the α-subunit of the non-gastric H+/K+ ATPase (HKα 2) is expressed on mRNA and protein level. However, compared to rat colon tissue, in INS- 1 E cells mRNA abundance was very low. In NH 4 Cl prepulsing experiments no K+-dependent pHi recovery was observed under Na+-free extracellular conditions. Nonetheless within 1 h, 20 µM SCH- 28080 inhibited GSIS by ∼ 50 %, while basal release was unaffected. The L-type ICav blocker nifedipine caused a full inhibition of GSIS at 10 and 20 µM. At 20 µM, SCH- 28080 inhibited ICav comparable to 20 µM nifedipine and in addition augmented IKATP recorded at - 60 mV and hyperpolarized Vmem by ∼ 15 mV. Cell viability 2 and 24 h post treatment with SCH- 28080 was dose-dependently inhibited with IC 50 values of 22. 9 µM and 15. 3 µM, respectively. At 20 µM the percentages of Annexin-V+, caspase+ and propidium iodide+ cells were significantly increased after 24 and 48 h. Concurrently, the MCV was significantly decreased (apoptotic volume decrease, AVD) and the SSC signal was increased. At concentrations &#x 3 e; 40 – 50 µM, SCH- 28080 became progressively cytotoxic causing a steep increase in necrotic cells already 2 h post treatment and a breakdown of ΔΨm within 4 h under 50 and 100 µM while 10 and 20 µM had no effect on ΔΨm within 24 h. Conclusion: We demonstrate expression of HKα 2 in rat INS- 1 E cells. However, the pump is apparently non-functional under the given conditions. Nonetheless the H+/K+ ATPase blocker SCH- 28080 inhibits insulin secretion and induces cell death. Importantly, we show that SCH- 28080 inhibits ICav - and activates KATP channels identifying them as novel “off-targets” of the inhibitor, causing hyperpolarization of Vmem and inhibition of insulin secretion...|$|R

We demonstrated that Foxi 1 is exclusively expressed in cells positive for the “kidney specific” vATPase subunits B 1 and a 4, as well as the anion exchangers AE 1 and pendrin, all characteristics for acid/base regulating cells of the inner ear, kidney and epididymis, called “mitochondria rich” cells. We present evidence that Foxi 1 is required for the expression of these genes. Furthermore, in transfection experiments and in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) we established direct transcriptional activation of promoter constructs by Foxi 1. This activation was abolished when specific Foxi 1 cis-elements on the promoters were mutated. 		Previously we have shown that mice with target disruption of the Foxi 1 locus exhibit severe cochlear and vestibular malformation and that Foxi 1 is expressed in endolymphatic epithelial cells important for regulation of volume and composition of endolymph fluid. We have also shown that pendrin is missing from endolymphatic epithelium in Foxi 1 deficient mice, making human FOXI 1 a potential transcriptional activator of the gene coding for pendrin, the SLC 26 A 4 gene. While recessive mutations in the SLC 26 A 4 gene are known to be responsible for Pendred syndrome (PS) and non-syndromic hearing loss associated with enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA), a large percentage of patients with this phenotype lack mutations in the SLC 26 A 4 coding region in one or both alleles. We have identified and characterized a key transcriptional regulatory element in the SLC 26 A 4 promoter that binds FOXI 1. Moreover, we have identified six PS or non-syndromic EVA patients with mutations in FOXI 1 that inhibits its activation of SLC 26 A 4 transcription 	 In summary, we present molecular data showing that Foxi 1 is required for the expression {{of some of the most}} important transporter molecules of acid-base regulation in the inner ear, kidney and epididymis, establishing Foxi 1 as an essential regulator of fluid homeostasis in these organs. Hence, mice deficient for Foxi 1, beside their early onset deafness, develop dRTA and male infertility. We also demonstrate that mutations in the human FOXI 1 gene are involved in pathogenetic mechanisms underlying human deafness. Finally, these results together with our earlier findings in mice support the hypothesis that mutations in the human FOXI 1 gene might prove to cause a sensorineural deafness syndrome with distal renal tubular acidosis and male infertility...|$|R
40|$|After {{the toxic}} spill {{occurred}} at Aznalcóllar pyrite mine (Southern Spain), a wide area of croplands near the Doñana Wild Park was contaminated with 4. 5 million m 3 of slurries composed of <b>acidic</b> waters <b>loaded</b> with toxic metals and metalloids such as As, Sb, Zn, Pb, Cu, Co, Tl, Bi, Cd, Ag, Hg and Se. Today, 6 {{years after the}} spill, the concentration of toxic elements in these soils is still very high, {{in spite of the}} efforts to clean the zone. However, some plant species have colonised this contaminated area. Legumes possessing N 2 -fixing nodules on their roots represented a significant proportion of these plants. Our objective was to use the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis as a new tool for bioremediate the affected area. We have isolated about 100 Rhizobium strains, 41 of them being resistant to high concentrations of As (300 mg l- 1), Cu (100 mg l- 1) and Pb (500 mg l- 1). Their phenotypes and bioaccumulation potentials have been characterised by their growth rates in media supplemented with As and heavy metals. The presence of the resistance genes in some strains has been confirmed by PCR and Southern blot hybridisation. Several Rhizobium were symbiotically effective in the contaminated soils. On the other hand, the first steps in nodule establishment seemed to be more affected by heavy metals than N 2 -fixation.

40|$|Abstraet [...] Biosorption of Cu 2 + by Sargassum fluitans seaweed biomass protonated by an <b>acidic</b> wash or <b>loaded</b> with Ca-'+ {{is based}} on ion exchange. The uptake of Cu 2 + is {{respectively}} accompanied bya release of either H + or Ca-'+ into the solution phase. The effects of Ca-, H- and H/Ca-cycles {{on the performance of}} a continuous-flow biosorption fixed-bed were established. The Ca-cycle applied to Sargassum biomass in a packed bed led to a high degree of a column utilization but did not allow an effective Cu recovery. The H-cycle permitted 100 % Cu recovery but also shortened the sorption column service time. The combined Ca/H-cycle was shown to be inefficient due to the time consuming regeneration f biomass from the H-form to the Ca-form. Biomass pretreatment with 1 % (w) solution of CaCI 2 and with 0. 1 M HCI resulted in the same Cu uptake of 75 mg/g. The Ca-pretreated biomass lost approximately 30 % of its Cu capacity with subsequent acidic wash. The equilibrium aspects of Cu removal and recovery in a biosorption column were analyzed through the concept of ion-exchange isotherms. The dynamics of Cu sorption and of biomass regeneration i a fixed-bed column was predicted by numerically solving the equations of a proposed ion-exchange model. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd Key words [...] biosorption, ion-exchange, Cu removal, Cu recovery, fixed-bed column, regeneration NOMENCLATUR...|$|R

An {{understanding}} of the physiology and metabolic complexity of microbial consortia involved in metal solubilization {{is a prerequisite for}} the rational improvement of bioleaching technologies.

40|$|The {{influence}} of mesoporosity and silylation on the physico-chemical and catalytic properties of Mo/HZSM- 5 in methane dehydroaromatization was investigated. The zeolites {{were characterized by}} XRD, 27 Al and 95 Mo NMR, UV–Vis, UV Raman and pyridine IR spectroscopy and TEM. Base-desilicated mesoporous and bulk HZSM- 5 zeolites with comparable Brønsted acidity were employed as <b>acidic</b> supports. Mo <b>loading</b> was optimized to minimize loss of acidity. Surface silylation of Mo/HZSM- 5 resulted in improved Mo-oxide dispersion. More intensive silylation led to decreased Mo-oxide dispersion because of increased hydrophobicity. High methane conversion rates were associated with small Mo-oxide precursor particles. Silylation of the external surface of Mo/HZSM- 5 led to higher methane conversion and less coke formation. On contrary, silylation of HZSM- 5 prior to Mo introduction had {{a negative effect on}} the performance. Post-synthesis silylation of Mo/HZSM- 5 affected the Mo-oxide phase. The amount of hard coke decreased with increasing silylation degree due to deactivation of acid sites at the external surface. It also decreased naphthalene yield. Methane conversion and aromatics selectivity were lower for mesoporous Mo/HZSM- 5 compared with bulk Mo/HZSM- 5. Although the initial Mo-oxide dispersion was higher, the different nature of the mesopore surface resulted in rapid formation of large Mo-carbide particles with higher coke selectivity. Silylation slightly improved activity and selectivity to benzene...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} MoO 3 /H-ZSM- 5 (Si/Al= 25) {{catalysts}} were prepared via calcination at a lower-than-usual temperature (400 oC) and subsequently evaluated in the methanol-to-hydrocarbon reaction {{at that same}} temperature. The catalytic properties of those catalysts were compared with the sample prepared at the more conventional, higher temperature of 500 oC. For the lower temperature preparations, molybdenum oxide was preferentially dispersed over the zeolite external surface, while only the higher loading level of MoO 3 (7. 5 wt% or higher) led to observable inner migration of the Mo species into the zeolite channels, with concomitant partial loss of the zeolite Brønsted acidity. On the MoO 3 modified samples, the early-period gas yield, especially for valuable propylene and C 4 products, was noticeably accelerated, and is gradually converted into an enhanced liquid aromatic formation. The 7. 5 wt% MoO 3 /H-ZSM- 5 sample prepared at 400 oC thereby achieved {{a balance between the}} zeolite surface dispersion of Mo species, their inner channel migration and the corresponding effect on the intrinsic Brønsted acidity of the <b>acidic</b> zeolite. That <b>loading</b> level also possessed the highest product selectivity (after 5 h reaction) to benzene, toluene and xylenes, as well as higher early-period valuable gas product yields in time-on-stream experiments. However, MoO 3 loading levels of 7. 5 wt% and above also resulted in earlier catalyst deactivation by enhanced coke accumulation at, or near, the zeolite channel openings. Our research illustrates that the careful adoption of moderate/lower temperature dispersion processes for zeolite catalyst modification gives considerable potential for tailoring and optimizing the system’s catalytic performanc...|$|R
40|$|Background context: Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} new therapeutic strategy using transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), especially bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs), to preserve intervertebral disc (IVD) structure and functions. It {{is important to understand}} whether and how the MSCs survive and thrive in the hostile microenvironment of the degenerated IVD. Therefore, this review majorly examines how resident disc cells, hypoxia, low nutrition, <b>acidic</b> pH, mechanical <b>loading,</b> endogenous proteinases, and cytokines regulate the behavior of the exogenous MSCs. Purpose: To review and summarize the effect of the microenvironment in biological characteristics of BM-MSCs for IVD regeneration; the presence of endogenous stem cells and {{the state of the art}} in the use of BM-MSCs to regenerate the IVD in vivo were also discussed. Study design: Literature review. Methods: MEDLINE electronic database was used to search for articles concerning stem/progenitor cell isolation from the IVD, regulation of the components of microenvironment for MSCs, and MSC-based therapy for IVD degeneration. The search was limited to English language. Results: Stem cells are probably resident in the disc, but exogenous stem cells, especially BM-MSCs, are currently the most popular graft cells for IVD regeneration. The endogenous disc cells and the biochemical and biophysical components in the degenerating disc present a complicated microenvironment to regulate the transplanted BM-MSCs. Although MSCs regenerate the mildly degenerative disc effectively in the experimental and clinical trials, many underlying questions are in need of further investigation. Conclusions: There has been a dramatic improvement in the understanding of potential MSC-based therapy for IVD regeneration. The use of MSCs for IVD degeneration is still at the stage of preclinical and Phase 1 studies. The effects of the disc microenvironment in MSCs survival and function should be closely studied for transferring MSC transplantation from bench to bedside successfully. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.
