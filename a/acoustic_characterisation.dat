40|$|Thesis (MTech (Electrical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology. Pulsed Ultrasound Velocimetry {{combined}} with Pressure Difference (PUV+PD) measurement is a non-invasive in-line rheometric technique {{which is used}} to analyse the complex flow properties of industrial fluids for quality control purposes. Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) and Technical Research Institute of Sweden (SP) have developed and patented a new PUV+PD based system, called Flow-Viz™. Despite this advancement, the system and ultrasound sensor technology have not been fully tested and evaluated {{in a wide range of}} industrial fluids. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>characterisation</b> tests were carried out at SP, with the aim of understanding the ultrasound beam properties after propagating through industrial stainless steel (316 L) pipe walls. For these tests, a high-precision robotic XYZ-scanner and needle hydrophone setup were used. Different ultrasound sensor configurations were mounted to a stainless steel pipe while using different coupling media between the transducer-to-wedge and sensor wedge-to-pipe boundaries. The ultrasound beam propagation after the wall interface was measured by navigating the needle hydrophone within a predefined 2 -dimensional spatial grid. The most suitable coupling material was determined from the <b>acoustic</b> <b>characterisation,</b> and then used in the in-line rheological characterisation tests to evaluate the performance of the Flow-VizTM rheometric unit against conventional tube viscometry. The in-line rheological tests were conducted with bentonite, kaolin and Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) model fluids. The flow loop used consisted of three different pipe test sections; and two concentrations of each fluid were tested in order to ascertain the consistency of the measurements. The in-line rheological tests showed good agreement (± 15 %) between the two techniques and Flow-VizTM was able to provide important data at very low shear rates. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>characterisation</b> indicated that variations in the beam properties were highly dependent on the acoustic couplants used to mount the sensors to the stainless steel pipes. Furthermore, the in-line results showed the effectiveness of Flow-VizTM as an industrial rheometer. The non-invasive ultrasound sensor technology, was for the first time acoustically characterised through stainless steel. This information will now be used to further optimise the unique technology for advanced industrial applications, e. g. oil drilling fields, complex cement grout and food processing applications...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} well {{established}} that an interaction between combustion and acoustics can produce self-sustained acoustic oscillations. In recent years, thermo-acoustic instabilities have been a hot research topic, mainly because of a drive for more environmentally friendly gas turbines. Reducing NOx and CO gas emissions and increasing efficiency means lean combustion, but this makes the combustion chamber of the gas turbine more prone to self-induced thermo-acoustic instabilities. These thermo-acoustic instabilities are not fully understood, and are detrimental to both the efficiency and structural integrity of a gas turbine. In an effort to {{shed some light on}} the matter, this thesis studies a jet experiencingtransverse acoustic forcing. It deals with a non-combusting (air) jet forced with speakers,in order to remove the additional complications of thermal interactions, and gain a better grasp of the fundamental mechanics behind. An acoustic chamber was constructed which could be set up in multiple configurations. A total of 6 configurations were tested for suitability for experiments. A number of simulations were carried out in order to predict the responsesExtensive <b>acoustic</b> <b>characterisations</b> of each configuration was carried out and evaluated. These involved mainly frequency sweeps, where the acoustic response of the chamber was tested over a range of frequencies, and mode evaluation, where data gathered on the amplitudes of microphone signals was compared to prediction from simulations. The best configuration was selected, and the effect of transverse acoustic forcingon an air jet was investigated. Significant PIV images were not obtained within the time constraints, and thus the final discussion revolves around the raw images themselves rather than PIV images. Seven positions ranging inbetween the pressure antinode and node of the acoustic field were filmed. Finally, the images showing hitherto unobserved vortex rollups were discussed. </p...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} the acoustic properties of ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) at high ultrasound frequencies. In recent years, there has been increasing development {{in the use of}} high frequency ultrasound in the fields of preclinical, intravascular, ophthalmology and superficial tissue imaging. Although research studying the acoustic response of UCAs at low diagnostic ultrasonic frequencies has been well documented, quantitative information on the acoustical properties of UCAs at high ultrasonic frequencies is limited. In this thesis, acoustical characterisation of three UCAs was performed using a preclinical ultrasound scanner (Vevo 770, VisualSonics Inc., Canada). Initially the acoustical characterisation of five high frequency transducers was measured using a membrane hydrophone with an active element of 0. 2 mm in diameter to quantify the transmitting frequencies, pressures and spatial beam profiles of each of the transducers. Using these transducers and development of appropriate software, high frequency acoustical characterisation (speed and attenuation) of an agar-based tissue mimicking material (TMM) was performed using a broadband substitution technique. The results from this study showed that the acoustical attenuation of TMM varied nonlinearly with frequency and the speed of sound was approximately constant 1548 m·s- 1 in the frequency range 12 - 47 MHz. The acoustical properties of three commercially available lipid encapsulated UCAs including two clinical UCAs Definity (Lantheus Medical Imaging, USA) and SonoVue (Bracco, Italy) and one preclinical UCAs MicroMarker (untargeted) (VisualSonics, Canada) were studied using the software and techniques developed for TMM characterisation. Attenuation, contrast-to-tissue ratio (CTR) and subharmonic to fundamental ratio were measured at low acoustic pressures. The results showed that large off-resonance and resonant MBs predominantly contributed to the fundamental response and MBs which resonated at half of the driven frequency predominantly contributed to subharmonic response. The effect of needle gauge, temperature and injection rate on the size distribution and acoustic properties of Definity and SonoVue was measured and was found to have significant impacts. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>characterisations</b> of both TMM and UCAs in this thesis extend our understanding from low frequency to high frequency ultrasound and will enable the further development of ultrasound imaging techniques and UCAs design specifically for high frequency ultrasound applications...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHere are {{proposed}} two automatic detectors of Barau's petrel (Pterodroma baraui) and tropical shearwater (Puffinus bailloni) vocalisations in noisy audio recordings (1) trained {{with a low}} number of positive training instances, and (2) whose performances would be the highest possible. To do so, acoustic recordings were performed in one Barau's petrel colony between February and May 2014 (85 h) and in two tropical shearwater colonies in March and April (21 h). Manual and automatic methods of segmentation were combined. Manual segmentation allowed (1) to miss a very few number of positive segments and (2) to avoid introducing false positive instances. Automatic segmentation provided quickly a diversified set of negative instances. Manual labelling must be regarded as an investment, for current and future works. A random forest classifier and classical methods of <b>acoustic</b> signal <b>characterisation</b> (cepstral coefficients, spectral moments, etc.) were tested. Best models were able to discriminate each target species calls from other sounds of its colony with F 1 scores of 88 % (Barau's petrel, 1015 samples) and 85 % (tropical shearwater, 1217 samples). The acoustic monitoring of nocturnal burrow-nesting seabirds based on (1) data collected by autonomous recording units in harsh, windy and wet environments and (2) automatic analysis tools is feasible. The size of our database was limited. Consequently further works {{will be necessary to}} study robustness of models on long time-series data...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTherapeutic microbubbles {{could make}} an {{important}} contribution to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>characterisation</b> was performed on microfluidic generated microbubble populations that either were bare or had liposomes attached. Through the use of broadband attenuation techniques (3 – 8  MHz), the shell stiffness was measured to be 0. 72  ±  0. 01 and 0. 78  ±  0. 05 N/m and shell friction was 0. 37  ±  0. 05 and 0. 74  ±  0. 05  ×  10 − 6  kg/s for bare and liposome-loaded microbubbles, respectively. Acoustic scatter revealed that liposome-loaded microbubbles had a lower subharmonic threshold, occurring from a peak negative pressure of 50  kPa, compared with 200  kPa for equivalent bare microbubbles. It was found that liposome loading had a negligible effect on the destruction threshold for this microbubble type, because at a mechanical index > 0. 4 (570  kPa), 80 % of both populations were destroyed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Acoustic</b> {{imaging and}} <b>characterisation</b> of buried objects (and in {{particular}} archaeological materials) in shallow-water (< 5 m) is often unsuccessful owing to {{problems related to}} vessel-induced bubble turbulence and the restricted acoustic geometry of the system. A 2 D surveying method that tackles these problems has been tested on the known wreck of the Grace Dieu (1418), Henry V’s flagship, currently buried within the inter-tidal sediments of the Hamble River. The wooden hull is recognisable in the seismic sections as a high amplitude anomaly underlain by an acoustic blanking zone. Close survey line spacing (ca. 1 m) allowed the construction of time slices, identifying the ovate plan of the hull. High, predominantly negative, reflection coefficients suggest this anomaly corresponds to degraded oak timbers buried within the sediment.

Electric conductivity was also measured using the same instrument. The ultrasonic profile in terms of attenuation and sound speed in the megahertz frequency range, allowed the characterisation of the different zones of the ternary diagram such as microemulsion, emulsion and gel zones, {{as well as the}} evaluation of water state and particle size.

40|$|Accurate <b>acoustic</b> <b>characterisation</b> is an {{essential}} component of any experimental investigation concerning the use and development of microbubble contrast agents. It is of increasing importance as applications such as therapy and molecular and quantitative imaging are investigated. Such characterisation is generally conducted in the laboratory in the form of bulk acoustic studies or optical observation of single bubbles using high speed photography in a water tank containing "out-gassed" water. The approach is widely used in acoustics to prevent inaccurate measurements being made due to the presence of gas bubbles settling on instrumentation, however, the term is often used to cover a range of water preparation techniques and the final gas content of the water is not usually stated. This technical note demonstrates the influence of gas content on the stability of microbubble contrast agents and concludes that characterisation should always be conducted in equilibrated, gas-saturated water to ensure accurate and repeatable measurements are made...|$|E

40|$|Noise from {{continuous}} positive airway pressure (CPAP) flow generators {{is controlled}} using very small, irregularly shaped mufflers which must attenuate noise at frequencies up to 5 kHz. This thesis investigates computational and experimental techniques {{to predict the}} acoustic performance of these mufflers and presents a computational technique to efficiently optimise the muffler design in order to maximise the performance. The work presented in this thesis can be roughly grouped as (1) acoustic modelling, (2) experimental measurements and (3) parametric design optimisation. In the first group, three different analytical techniques were reviewed {{in the context of}} modelling the acoustic performance of a simple expansion chamber reactive muffler. Three-dimensional acoustic finite element analysis (FEA) models of simple geometries and complex CPAP device muffler geometries were then developed. Polyurethane foam inserts were incorporated into the FEA models of the muffler designs. The computational results of both the reactive and resistive designs were compared to the analytical results and were successfully validated against experimental data. The experimental component of the thesis includes measurement of the acoustic performance of mufflers and <b>acoustic</b> <b>characterisation</b> of polyurethane foams. The transmission loss of the simple and complex mufflers was measured using a two-microphone acoustic pulse method. The acoustic performance of the mufflers was also measured in the presence of mean flow to examine the influence of air flow on the transmission loss. The acoustic properties of two polyurethane foams were obtained in an impedance tube using a two cavity method. A rig for measuring the airflow resistivity of the porous materials was designed, constructed and commissioned. The combined <b>acoustic</b> <b>characterisation</b> of the foams was incorporated into the FEA models, enabling the modelling of muffler designs which contain absorptive elements. In the final part of the thesis, a methodology to efficiently optimise muffler configurations to maximise their acoustic performance was developed. This involved the development of an integrated model that couples various optimisation tools available through the MATLAB interface with the acoustic FEA capabilities of COMSOL. The reactive and resistive components of a prototype CPAP device muffler were independently optimised for acoustic performance. Results were also obtained for the transmission loss of the muffler for which the reactive and resistive components were simultaneously optimised. The merits of each approach are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{interest}} for cavitation noise studies and prediction is increasing {{in the field}} of naval architecture, mainly because of attention to environmental issues. Model scale tests in cavitation tunnels are commonly considered {{as one of the most}} effective tools for cavitation noise studies.

40|$|Disordered speech {{can present}} with rhythmic problems, {{impacting}} on an individual’s ability to communicate. Effective treatment {{relies on the}} availability of sensitive methods to characterise the problem. Rhythm metrics based on segmental durations originally designed for crosslinguistic research have the potential to provide such information. However, these measures may be associated with problems that impact on their clinical usefulness. This paper aims to address the perceptual validity of crosslinguistic metrics as indicators of rhythmic disorder. Speakers with dysarthria and matched healthy participants performed a range of tasks, including syllable and sentence repetition tasks and a spontaneous monologue. A range of rhythm metrics as well as clinical measures were applied. Results showed that none of the metrics could differentiate disordered from healthy speakers, despite clear perceptual differences, suggesting that factors beyond segment duration impacted on rhythm perception. The investigation also highlighted a number of areas where caution needs to be exercised in the application of rhythm metrics to disordered speech. The paper concludes that the underlying speech impairment leading to the perceptual and <b>acoustic</b> <b>characterisation</b> of rhythmic problems needs to be established through detailed analysis of speech characteristics in order to construct effective treatment plans for individuals with speech disorders...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the possibility to}} apply polyharmonic distortion modelling, used for nonlinear characterisation of microwave systems, to <b>acoustic</b> <b>characterisation</b> of samples with non-linear properties such as perforates and other facing sheets used in aircraft engine liners and automotive mufflers. In some previous papers multi-port techniques using sinusoidal excitation for characterization of samples with non-linear properties were developed and experimentally tested. These techniques aimed at taking non-linear energy transfer between sound field harmonics into account. Essentially linear system identification theory was however used assuming that superposition applies and that the functions studied are analytical. Polyharmonic distortion modelling does not assume that the function relating waves incident and reflected or transmitted is analytic nor does it assume application of normal superposition. This technique is tested on experimental data obtained from measurements on a perforate mounted in a duct. The similarity to the previously developed nonlinear scattering matrix techniques is demonstrated. It is shown how the results obtained {{can be used to}} analyse nonlinear energy transfer to higher harmonics. © 2011 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

40|$|Monitoring {{of debris}} flows aimed to the {{assessment}} of their physical parameters is very important both for theoretical and practical purposes. Peak discharge and total volume of debris flows are crucial for designing effective countermeasures in many populated mountain areas where losses of lives and property damage could be avoided. This study quantifies the relationship between flow depth, acoustic amplitude of debris flow induced ground vibrations and front velocity in the experimental catchment of Acquabona, Eastern Dolomites, Italy. The analysis of data brought about the results described in the following. Debris flow depth and amplitude of the flow-induced ground vibrations show a good positive correlation. Estimation of both mean front velocity and peak discharge can be simply obtained monitoring the ground vibrations, through geophones installed close to the flow channel; the total volume of debris flow can be so directly estimated from the integral of the ground vibrations using a regression line. The application of acoustic technique to debris flow monitoring seems {{to be of the}} outmost relevance in risk reduction policies and in the correct management of the territory. Moreover this estimation is possible in other catchments producing debris flows of similar characteristics by means of their <b>acoustic</b> <b>characterisation</b> through quick and simple field tests (Standard Penetration Tests and seismic refraction surveys) ...|$|E
40|$|The sound {{radiation}} properties of real normal modes {{are often used}} to characterise acoustic sources such as vibrating plates. The assumption of homogeneously distributed structural damping is usually made and in consequence the eigenmodes are real. With {{the increasing use of}} high-performance composite structures and the demanding requirements for acoustic comfort, damping treatments such as constrained layer damping or embedded elastomer layers may be distributed locally at some critical locations of the vibrating structure. This violates the assumption of homogeneously distributed structural damping and results in complex mode shapes. In this case, dynamics of the vibrating systems within the resonances is no longer dominated by pure standing waves, but also by a superposition with travelling waves. This paper presents the results of a numerical study on {{sound radiation}} properties of this phenom-enon, generally known as complex modes of vibration. The finite element model of an inhomoge-neously damped plate is used to generate and investigate complex vibration patterns. The level of modal complexity of the generated complex modes is characterized by the modal collinearity index and the spatial distribution of the standing wave ratio. The fluid structure interaction is implemented by a elemental radiator approach and used for the <b>acoustic</b> <b>characterisation</b> of vibration patterns in terms of far-field radiation efficiencies and spatial distributions of sound intensity.

In particular, an experimental research activity previously performed by the authors about the dynamic behaviour of automotive wheels has been extended to the acoustic field. This experimental research has begun in the laboratory of the Mechanics Department of Politecnico di Torino where the modal analysis of the SAAB 640 / 6 Jx 15 H 2 wheel has been carried on step by step, starting from the rim in the most simple constraint condition to realise in laboratory, that is the free-free condition, up to the wheel (rim with tire) clamped to a real automotive hub; two cases have been considered: the wheel in hanging condition, that is with the vehicle on a lift-bridge, and the wheel laying on the ground. Then an acoustic study, analytical, numerical and experimental, of the cavity tire has also been performed. The experimental analysis has been carried on by introducing a microphone in the tire cavity (with no pressure) and by measuring the corresponding response level. The analytical study has been performed by utilising analytical relationships known in literature and a model of the tire cavity with an equivalent geometry. The numerical analysis has been carried on by means of a Boundary Element Method (BEM) model of the cavity. All obtained results, both dynamic and acoustic, have been analysed and compared to those concerning the experimental tests of the wheel clamped to the vehicle hub...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present and discuss a range of in-situ and {{laboratory}} methods can be used to measure the morphological characteristics of porous materials. In the case of foams and granular media used for noise control applications, the most common of these characteristics are pore size and its distribution, porosity, and pore connectivity. In the case of fibrous media, the most useful non-acoustical characteristics are the fibre size and packing density. In the case of outdoor surfaces such as gravel, sandy soils, and agricultural land, which can be partly saturated with water, it is of direct interest to measure the degree of water saturation hydraulic permeability and pore size gradient. In the case of materials with good physiochemical properties, it is of interest to determine their internal pore surface area, porosity, and pore size scales. In this paper, the existing and newly emerging <b>acoustic</b> <b>characterisation</b> methods are discussed in terms of their complexity, accuracy, and sample requirements. The application of these methods relate to traditional needs to measure and predict the in-situ performance of noise control elements and outdoor surfaces, to ensure the quality control during material manufacturing process and to be able to measure non-invasively the micro- and nano-structure of porous media which is used in catalytic filters, electric capacitors and for gas storage.

40|$|The high {{efficiency}} with which gas microbubbles can scatter ultrasound {{compared to the}} surrounding blood pool or tissues has led to their widespread employment as contrast agents in ultrasound imaging. In recent years their application has seen expansion from purely imaging to include the development of localised bio-effects for therapeutic applications and as agents to achieve super-resolution imaging. The growing exploitation of contrast agents in ultrasound, and in particular these recent developments, have amplified the need to characterise and fully understand microbubble behaviour. The aim in doing so is to more fully exploit their utility for both diagnostic imaging and potential future therapeutic applications. This paper presents the key characteristics of microbubbles that determine their efficacy in diagnostic and therapeutic applications and the corresponding techniques for their measurement. In each case we have presented information regarding the methods available and their respective strengths and limitations, {{with the aim of}} presenting information relevant to the selection of appropriate characterisation methods.

40|$|In {{the shallow}} water coastal area, {{visibility}} is comparatively restricted, yet marine mammals are still able to navigate, manoeuvre and find food without any noticeable difficulties. Our work has focused particularly on grey whales (Eschrichtius robustus) due to their close association with {{the shallow water}} environment. One of their primary food sources is found in kelp beds, in a highly cluttered and acoustically active environment. Because the usefulness of vision {{is limited by the}} turbidity of the coastal submarine environment, it is logical to believe they rely heavily on their hearing. Unlike dolphins and porpoises, grey whales do not appear to use active echolocation techniques. We propose therefore that they are making use of the ambient noise for passive <b>acoustic</b> <b>characterisation</b> of their environment. We are investigating what sounds are available to these animals in their feeding grounds and what types of visualisation techniques they might be employing. During the summer of 2006, ambient noise recordings were collected in two bays along the central coast of British Columbia, canada, where grey whales are known to feed. The array used was a fixed 2 -hydrophone design, horizontally separated by a small distance, analogous to a set of ears, and was deployed from a kayak. The acoustic signals were recorded near the surface at a broadband frequency range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz where the water column depths ranged from 3 m to 30 m approximately, and in several distinct environments (deeper water, shallow water with kelp bed, shallow water with bare seabed, surf zone).

40|$|Thesis (DTech (Electrical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2011 Ultrasonic Velocity Profiling (UVP) is both {{a method}} and a device to measure an {{instantaneous}} one-dimensional velocity profile along a measurement axis by using Doppler echography. UVP is an ideal technique since it is non-invasive, works with opaque systems, inexpensive, portable and easy to implement relative to other velocity profile measurement methods. Studies {{have suggested that the}} accuracy of the measured velocity gradient close to wall interfaces need to be improved. The reason for this is due to, depending on the installation method, distortion caused by cavities situated in front of ultrasonic transducers, measurement volumes overlapping wall interfaces, refraction of the ultrasonic wave as well as sound velocity variations. A new ultrasonic transducer, which incorporates a delay line material optimised for beam forming could reduce these problems (Wiklund, 2007). If these could be addressed, UVP could be used for the measurement of velocity profiles in complex geometries (e. g. contractions, valves, bends and other pipe fittings) where the shape of the velocity profile is critical to derive models for estimating fluid momentum and kinetic energy for energy efficient designs. The objective of this research work was to optimise the UVP system for accurate complex flow measurements by evaluating a specially designed delay line transducer and implementing advanced signal processing techniques. The experimental work was conducted at the Material Science and Technology (MST) group at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT). This work also formed part of a collaborative project with SIK - The Swedish Institute for Food and Biotechnology. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>characterisation</b> of the ultrasonic transducers using an advanced robotic setup was done at SI K.

40|$|A {{cataloguing}} of road pavements {{is proposed}} {{based on the}} acoustic performances of the surfacings {{as a function of}} the type of pavement, its state of maintenance and the type of degradations present. The catalogue has been compiled using data from the most recent experiments conducted by the University of Padova on tyre-road noise, evaluated with the “Close Proximity Method”. This method, which allows the reference system for the measurement of noise to be shifted from an external receptor fixed at the roadside, to one fixed on the vehicle, has allowed many types of pavements to be investigated relatively quickly and easily. The <b>acoustic</b> <b>characterisation</b> of the pavements is based on both the equivalent sound level generated by the vehicles on different pavements and on spectral distribution. This latter, equivalent level being equal, is necessary for identifying the field of frequency where the sound energy is concentrated, and therefore to characterise the greater or lesser “disturbance” caused by the noise. Frequency analysis of the components of the rolling noise also allows the combination of materials to be selected at the design stage, which satisfies, as well as the requisites of adhesion and evenness, also that of low noise. The classification regards mainly urban roads built with traditional close-textured and open-graded bituminous concrete, rehabilitation overlays, surface treatments and segmental pavings, but also includes the porous asphalt wearing courses traditionally used in extra-urban environments. The acoustic efficiency of road markings was also verified in the study. The state of maintenance was determined by both visual observation and on the basis of the surface texture level, quantified using the MPD index. The compilation of the catalogue has thrown light on the acoustic effect of the most common pavement degradations on the basis of type, seriousness and extent. This kind of evaluation represents a useful support when planning roadway construction and maintenance, especially in built-up areas...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{assess the}} {{relationships}} between cognitive status, speech impairment and communicative participation in Parkinson’s disease. Introduction: Speech and communication difficulties, as well as cognitive impairment, are prevalent in Parkinson’s. The contributions of cognitive impairment and acoustic speech characteristics remain equivocal. Relationships between Impairment and Participation levels of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) have not been thoroughly investigated. Methods: 45 people with Parkinson’s and 29 familiar controls performed read, mood and conversational speech tasks {{as part of a}} multimethod investigation. Data analysis formed three main parts. Depression, cognition and communication were assessed using questionnaires. Phonetic analysis was used to produce an <b>acoustic</b> <b>characterisation</b> of speech. Listener assessment was used to assess conveyance of emotion and intelligibility. Qualitative Content Analysis was used to provide a participant’s insight into speech and communicative difficulties associated with Parkinson’s disease. Results: Cognitive status was significantly associated with certain read speech acoustic characteristics, emotional conveyance and communicative participation. No association was found with intelligibility or conversational speech acoustic characteristics. The only acoustic speech characteristics that predicted intelligibility were intensity and pause in the read speech condition. The contribution of intelligibility to communicative participation was modest. People with Parkinson’s disease reported a range of psychosocial, cognitive and physical factors affecting their speech and communication. Conclusions: I provide evidence for a role for cognitive status in emotional conveyance and communicative participation, but not necessarily general speech production, in Parkinson’s disease. I demonstrate that there may not be a strong relationship between ICF Impairment level speech measures and functional measures of communication. I also highlight the distinction between measures of communication at the ICF Activity and Participation levels. This study demonstrates that reduced participation in everyday communication in Parkinson’s disease appears to result from a complex interplay of physical, cognitive and psychosocial factors. Further research is required to apply these findings to contribute to future advances in speech and language therapy for Parkinson’s disease...|$|E
40|$|<b>Acoustic</b> <b>characterisation</b> of panel {{materials}} in simulated ocean conditions using the NPL Acoustic Pressure Vessel. A {{wide range of}} viscoelastic materials is used for encapsulation, housing and coating/lining in underwater acoustics. The acoustic properties of these materials can vary dramatically with frequency, temperature and depth, in particular when one {{is close to the}} glass-rubber transition for the material. Accurate characterisation of the acoustic properties is therefore of crucial importance when selecting materials and when assessing the performance of transducers. Techniques exist to determine properties such as echo reduction and transmission loss from measurements made on panels of the material, but these are typically undertaken in open laboratory tanks. This limits the range of testing of acoustic devices, since such tanks cannot provide the range of environmntal conditions that exist during deployment in the sea. Sea-trials are themselves expensive and one is limited by the prevailing temperature conditions in the sea where the measurements are carried out. An alternative to sea-trials is now available using the Acoustic Pressure Vessel (APV), recently commissioned on site at the UK's National Physical Laboratory (NPL) to provide the capability to undertake acoustic measurements under simulated ocean conditions. The environmental conditions within the APV can be modified to simulate ocean depths down to 700 m (hydrostatic pressure from atmospheric to 7 MPa) and temperatures from 2 o C to 35 o C. To meet the need for measurements of panel {{materials in}} ocean conditions, NPL is establishing a measurement facility in the APV, based on parametric array techniques, to allow the measurement of transmission loss, echo reduction and sound speed as functions of pressure, temperature and frequency. The problems of establishing a parametric array in the closed, confined space of the APV are examined in detail. Apparently simple tasks, such as mounting acoustic filter materials, and supporting and aligning the test panels themselves, can present substantial engineering challenges. Finally, test results of measurements of transmission loss and echo reduction are analysed and compared with parametric array measurements in an open tank...|$|E
40|$|THESIS 10336 This thesis {{documents}} a {{range of}} research carried out {{on the topic of}} glottal source and voice quality analysis. Initially, a review is given of the physiological and acoustic correlates of different vocal settings. This is followed by a discussion of the importance of glottal source and voice quality variation in spoken communication, and the impact of modelling these aspects on speech technology. Despite the potential benefit of <b>acoustic</b> <b>characterisation</b> of the glottal source for speech technology existing algorithms often suffer from a lack of robustness. To address this, the present thesis describes and evaluates a set of novel algorithms aimed at improving the robustness. The algorithms come under two headings; fine-grained, glottal synchronous methods and coarse-grained, voice quality detection methods. In terms of fine-grained methods a new algorithm, SE-VQ, has been developed which is optimised for analysis of {{a range of}} voice qualities. While maintaining the precision of the state-of-the-art on neutral speech, the new algorithm is shown to signihcantly improve performance on creaky voice regions. SE-VQ is then utilised as part of a novel LF model based parameterisation method (DyProg-LF) of estimated glottal source signals. The dynamic programming algorithm used in DyProg-LF is shown to avoid the coimnon problem of inconsistencies in parameter trajectories and is shown to provide better parameterisation than the state-of-the-art on both a carefully controlled dataset with manually obtained reference values as well as on a larger speech dataset. For coarse-grained methods, a new parameter, the Maxima Dispersion Quotient (MDQ), is proposed for discriminating breathy to tense voice. MDQ was shown to outperform existing parameters for discriminating the voice qualities, particularly for continuous speech, and also in terms of robustness to additive noise. A new method for detecting creaky voice is also described which utilises two parameters derived from the Linear Prediction-residual signal. These parameters are used as input features to a decision tree classifier which is shown to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art on a range of speech data varying in terms of speaker, gender, language, recording condition and speaking style. Finally, a software package, the Voice analysis toolkit, which contains the algorithms developed as part of this thesis, has been made publicly available. This has been done to encourage usage of the newly developed algorithms in applied work and future algorithm evaluations...|$|E
