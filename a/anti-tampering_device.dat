50|$|Projected water {{disruptors}} use a water-projectile shaped {{charge to}} destroy bombs, blasting the device apart and severing any detonating connections {{faster than any}} fuse or <b>anti-tampering</b> <b>device</b> on the bomb can react. One example is the BootBanger, deployed under the rear compartment of cars suspected to be carrying bombs. Projected water disruptors can be directional, such as the BootBanger; or omni-directional, an example being the Bottler.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Thanks to {{the spread}} of mobile technologies, we can access to the network anytime and from anywhere. In the near future, we will enable to realize the {{ubiquitous}} computing environment, in which user's mobile terminal assists in their activity. In the ubiquitous computing environment, user's mobile terminal manages personal information, which is used for negotiations with a service provider. However, various privacy problems, such as information leakage cases, have happened, so that we desire to protect our personal information. We propose a framework for protecting personal information. A basic idea of the framework is to make use of personal information through a program which the owner of personal information knows the behaviour of. We call this program trusted program, because the owner of personal information can trust a way of personal information use. Then, a user offers his/her trusted program to a service provider and compels the service provider to make use of his/her personal information. In this paper, we introduce the framework under the assumption of using an <b>anti-tampering</b> <b>device</b> and propose the method for creating trusted-program...|$|E

50|$|The {{design was}} based on the free-falling Blue Danube, but the Blue Peacock weighed 7.2 long ton lb. There would be two firing units, the casting and the warhead. Its steel casing was so large {{that it had to be}} tested {{outdoors}} in a flooded gravel pit near Sevenoaks in Kent.Since the bomb would be unattended, <b>anti-tamper</b> <b>devices</b> were also used. The casing was pressurised, and pressure and tilt switches were added. There were three different ways that the bomb could be detonated: a wire located three miles away, an eight-day timer, or <b>anti-tampering</b> <b>devices.</b> Once armed, Blue Peacock would detonate 10 seconds after being moved, if the casing lost pressure or if it was filled with water.|$|R

Notorious for kidnapping the town's cats and placing them in Bonsai trees (Lord Can't See-a-lot believed the trees to be much bigger than they were, and also a lot further away). Foiled by Burly arcade worker man after setting off the <b>anti-tamper</b> <b>device</b> on the pier arcade machine.|$|R
50|$|Stark {{began using}} this armor {{during the time}} that he served as the United States Secretary of Defense. Standard {{weaponry}} including repulsors, uni-beam and sonics. Concussion blasts were used against the Hand. Zero-point energy was used against Michael Pointer (aka The Collective). Via voice command, the armor could adopt an autonomous, robotic Battle Mode. If separated by magnetism, it could reform and return to Stark. Defensively, a repulsor shield could be extended to protect the armor and allies. Security was enhanced by upgrades to <b>anti-tampering</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{reporter}} {{is asked to}} televise a statement by the terrorists calling for delivery to them of every nuclear trigger device at the U.S. Naval Base in Charleston. Without these triggers, nuclear weapons on the naval warships and nuclear-powered submarines based at Charleston cannot be used. The terrorists reveal their motive is to completely disarm America of nuclear weapons, {{as well as to}} convince the Soviet Union to do the same, which they believe will completely prevent possible nuclear war. They also mention they have constructed their own nuclear device; one roughly equivalent to the bomb dropped on Nagasaki in 1945. Their device is set to detonate within 24 hours if their demand is not met, and has <b>anti-tampering</b> <b>devices</b> that will set it off if any attempt is made to move or disarm it.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{ingestion}} into a DCP server, KDMs {{are stored}} on flash memory {{in the media}} block or IMB. A KDM is written to enable the playback of a specific DCP on a specific media block or IMB, identified by its serial number during the authoring process. Media blocks and IMBs also contain a secure clock that {{is set in the}} factory cannot be altered by the end user, which the DCP servers to which they are attached use to determine showtimes. The secure clock prevents theaters from showing encrypted movies outside the times authorized by the KDM (e.g. after it has expired) by simply changing the date and time in the server's BIOS. Media blocks and IMBs also typically include <b>anti-tamper</b> <b>devices,</b> designed to self-destruct the unit if unauthorized modification of its hardware, software or secure clock is attempted.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- In {{biometric}} authentication, feature {{information of}} each enrolled person’s biometric information is enrolled as templates. Secure databases or <b>anti-tampered</b> <b>devices</b> store the templates in general. The biometric information, however, is irreplaceable information, {{when it is}} compromised. Thereby, one must give a special attention to protection of such information. On the other hands, increasing internet economical services causes a motivation of implementing online biometric authentication. We propose a novel protection technique for the biometric information, especially the feature information and the templates. The point of our proposal is that the extracted features and the enrolled templates are transformed by one-time transformation that is generated in each authentication. The transformed features and templates travel through insecure communication line like the internet, and they are used in matching process. This technique causes security against eavesdropping and replay attacks on the internet, because the transmitted feature information and the templates are different every time...|$|R
40|$|The energy {{industry}} is embarking upon an infrastructure transformation {{that will result}} in a national power grid that is more intelligent, robust, resilient, and secure. While the final form will not be known for quite some time, clearly a smarter grid will make better use of information. Whether an electric utility is making real-time adjustments in response to changing load conditions, or commercial and private consumers are making better choices, the timely availability of this information will become increasingly critical. Ultimately, the overall efficiency, reliability, and resilience of the grid is inextricably linked to information. Unfortunately, "the electric power sector is second from the bottom of all major U. S. industries in terms of R&D spending as a percentage of revenue, exceeding only pulp and paper [Amin 2011]. " Moreover, U. S. officials worry that cyber-spies could use their [demonstrated] access to shut down the grid or take control of power plants during a time of crisis or war [CIO 09, WSJ 09]. Protecting and trusting information is not unique to the grid. Indeed, the information security market is worth tens of billions of dollars, almost exclusively in cyber security products and services. Yet, solutions designed for the Internet are often not appropriate for securing the energy grid, which has a different set of priorities and communication needs. Any viable information security solution must address those unique challenges and features. The discussion at the CSIIR Workshop was primarily focused about the Energy Infrastructure Cyber Protection (ENCyP) Initiative. ENCyP is a multidisciplinary strategic theme oriented on cyber protection for the most critical and most vulnerable components of Energy Delivery System (EDS). The initiative derived from ORNL's focus on energy and cyber-physical defenses. On this basis we received just over 100 submissions stemming from both novel theoretical and empirical research focused on the many different aspects of ENCyP. We encouraged the participation of researchers and practitioners {{from a wide range of}} professional disciplines to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the needs, stakes and the evolving context ENCyP. Topics included: Security assurance/interoperability for Energy Delivery Systems (EDS) Scalable/trusted control (cyber-physical) systems security Visual analytics for cyber security Next generation control systems vulnerability assessment Wireless Smart Grid security SCADA, EDS communications security test beds Use cases and attack scenarios for EDS Wide area monitoring, protection & control AMI, demand-response, distribution grid management security Electric transportation & distributed energy resources security Policy/standards driven architectures for EDS <b>Anti-tamper</b> <b>device</b> architectures Cryptographic key management for EDS Security risk assessment and management for EDS Insider and life-cycle threats Automated vulnerability detection Access control management and authentication services for EDS Secure information exchange gateway & watchdog switches Bio-Inspired technologies for enhancing EDS cybersecurity A principle goal of the workshop was to foster discussions and dialog among the 210 registered attendees from North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. This goal was initiated and facilitated by 8 plenary keynote addresses including our banquet and reception speakers. There were also six invited speakers, including two panels of government and national laboratory representatives. A total of one hundred and three papers (i. e., extended abstracts [EAs]) were submitted involving over three hundred independent reviews from more than one hundred reviewers. Thirty two percent of the papers that were submitted received two reviews while all of the rest of the papers received three or more. Fifty-four EAs were accepted. Twenty-five posters were invited. All of the EAs, presentations and posters are included in our proceedings. The subject areas span the topics above and were organized into nine tracks: Security Assurance for EDS; Wide Area Monitoring, Protection and Control; Security Risk Assessment; Malware; Cyber Physical Security; Cryptographic Key Management; Use Cases and Attack Scenarios; Smart Grid Advanced Concepts; and <b>Anti-Tamper</b> <b>Devices</b> and Architectures...|$|R
