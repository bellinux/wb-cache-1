40|$|Objective: Elevated serum leptin can {{contribute}} to anorexia and poor nutrition in patients with chronic renal failure, because leptin is elevated in chronic renal failure patients with or without dialysis, especially in chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPO) patients. The {{aim of this study}} was to find whether leptin can be removed by peritoneal dialysis (PO) and to analyze factors that can affect serum leptin <b>after</b> <b>start</b> of CAPO by observing the change in serum leptin shortly <b>after</b> <b>start</b> of CAPO and its correlation with body mass index (BMI), with serum insulin, and with residual renal function [...] Design:Twenty patients who started CAPO during the observation period were studied. Serum leptin was measured by radioimmunoassay before start of CAPO, 3 5 days <b>after</b> <b>start</b> of CAPO, and 1 month and 3 months <b>after</b> <b>start</b> of CAPO.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the contribution of}} glycosylated haemoglobin change (HbA 1 c) on body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes <b>after</b> <b>start</b> of insulin therapy. We analysed 122 individual weight-profiles {{in relation to the}} change in HbA 1 c per se in these patients up to 36 months <b>after</b> the <b>start</b> of insulin therapy. Data were analysed separately for the first 9 months after commencement of insulin therapy and for the period thereafter. Within the first 9 months of insulin therapy mean body weight increased by 0. 52 kg per month. HbA 1 c decreased from 9. 9 +/- 1. 8 to 7. 9 +/- 1. 3 %. Only 12 % of the initial weight gain could be attributed to the change in HbA 1 c. Furthermore, the mean monthly increase in body weight gain was reduced by 0. 006 kg for every 1 kg higher body weight at baseline. From 9 to 36 months <b>after</b> <b>start</b> of insulin therapy, body weight increased by 0. 1 kg/month, which was independent of change in HbA 1 c. Improvement of glycaemic control per se contributes little to initial weight gain <b>after</b> <b>start</b> of insulin therapy in patients with T 2 DM. After 9 months of insulin treatment, weight gain is unrelated to change in glycosylated haemoglobin.
