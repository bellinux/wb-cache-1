A special emphasis was put on the correlation of the sample morphology with the current vs. time curves, especially in terms of differences between the surface morphology and the inner oxide structure. When the potential of 3 V was applied during anodization, micron-sized particles of SnC 2 O 4 were obtained on the surface of metallic tin, independently of the electrolyte concentration. On the contrary, the anodic oxidation of Sn foil at potentials between 4 and 8 V resulted in the formation of nanoporous tin oxides with two distinguishable layers: a less regular outer layer with smaller nanopores formed at the beginning of anodization, and an inner layer with well-defined and larger nanochannels. A dense, compact barrier layer was also observed at the bottom side of oxide. The morphology of an outer layer was found to be strongly dependent on <b>anodizing</b> <b>conditions.</b> For instance, {{a significant increase in the}} average pore diameter in the outer layer with increasing potential and concentration of the electrolyte, being a result of more effective field-assisted etching of anodic oxide and more vigorous oxygen evolution under the severe <b>anodizing</b> <b>conditions,</b> was observed. Contrary to this, no significant effect of <b>anodizing</b> <b>conditions</b> on the structure of the inner oxide layer was found. A strong linear relationship between the average steady-state current density and anodizing potential was observed for the potentials in the range of 5 – 8 V, what suggests that the reaction is limited by the mass transfer in the electrolyte.

40|$|Joule {{healing of}} the oxide-covered {{aluminum}} electrode {{is the major}} heal source during anodizing, {{and the extent of}} heat removal is dependent on the electrolyte How i. e. convection. For various galvanostatic and potentiostatic <b>anodizing</b> <b>conditions,</b> at different hulk electrolyte temperatures it was found that when the convection heat transfer is not uniform along the electrode surface, i. e. in a wall-jet electrode reactor, a local temperature distribution is established. Due to this nonuniform temperature, the anodic film exhibits a thickness distribution.

40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} with the mechanism of growth of porous anodic films formed on high purity aluminium and sputtering deposited aluminium over a wide range of current density between 5 to 50 mA/cm 2 for times up to 5400 s in 24. 5 wt % sulphuric acid and at temperatures of either 0 or 20 0 C. The resultant films were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS), nuclear reaction analysis (NRA), optical interferometery, microhardness and nanoindentation. The RBS analysis enabled determination of the composition of the porous films, which was expressed as Al 2 O 3. xAl 2 (SO 4) 3, with the sulphur species content increasing with increase in current density and decrease in temperature. The average expansion factor (expressing, the ratio of the film thickness to the oxidized aluminium thickness) increased between 5 mA/cm 2 and 50 mA/cm 2 for films formed at 0 0 C, extending from 1. 58 to 1. 88 and from 1. 57 to 1. 78 according to SEM and TEM respectively. For films fabricated at 20 0 C, the average expansion factor increased from 1. 45 to 1. 66 and from 1. 42 to 1. 67 derived from SEM and TEM respectively. The expansion factor increases as the current density increases for both temperatures, and decreases as electrolyte temperature for a given current density increases. The increase of expansion factor is also associated with a rise in the steady voltage during film growth. However, the film expansion does not depend on the anodizing time. The increase in expansion factor correlates with a small increase in the amount of sulphur in the film, which increases with rise of current density. The surface of the porous alumina revealed a network of furrows and ridges, reflecting the pattern of the cellular textures on the topography of the elecropolished aluminium. The retention of topography indicates that the thinning of the film due to chemical dissolution by the electrolyte is negligible, although softening of the film toward the film surface increases with rise of electrolyte temperature and anodizing time as determined by microhardness measurements on film cross-sections. For films fabricated at 0 0 C, nodules appeared with a low population density on the film surfaces formed at 20 mA/cm 2 for 5400 s, and a locally high population density, but non-uniform distribution, for films formed at 30 to 50 mA/cm 2 {{for a wide range of}} anodizing times. NRA determined the oxygen concentrations in the films, from which the efficiency of the film grown was derived. The efficiency showed a correlation with the expansion factor, with values increasing with rise of current density and with decrease in the anodizing temperature, ranging from 72 % to 87 % between 5 mA/cm 2 and 50 mA/cm 2, for an electrolyte temperature of 0 0 C, and between 66 % to 75 %, for the same range of current density, for an electrolyte temperature of 20 0 C. The change in the relative film thickness with a change of the <b>anodizing</b> <b>conditions</b> might due to either a rise in the film porosity under a constant efficiency of film growth (assuming a flow model) or an increase in the efficiency of film growth for a constant film porosity (for either a flow or dissolution model), or a combination of the two factors. However, the film expansion appeared to be relatively little dependent on the change of the porosity over selected <b>anodizing</b> <b>conditions.</b> The dependence of the efficiency on the <b>anodizing</b> <b>conditions</b> is possibly associated with a change in the transport number of ion species in the film with a reducing contribution of cation migration to the total ionic current with an increase in the current density and in decrease of the anodizing temperature, which correspond to conditions of increasing electric field. The film porosity probably develops by flow of film material underneath the pore base toward the cell wall, as indicated by distribution of tungsten band through the film and distribution of electrolyte species from previous work, with the displaced material enhancing the thickness of the film.

These devices rely on thin metal oxide films with a peculiar structure and composition, making precise control of oxide features vital. To this end, anodic oxidation allows a very large range of oxides to be formed on the surface of valve metals, whose thickness, structure and functional properties depend on the process parameters introduced. This work reports how memristive anodic oxides were obtained on titanium and other valve metals, such as niobium and tantalum. Methods: Anodic oxidation was performed on valve metals by immersion in H 2 SO 4 or H 3 PO 4 electrolytes and application of voltages ranging from 10 to 90 V. The memristive behavior was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry. Results: The behavior of differently grown oxides was compared to identify the best conditions to achieve good memristive performances. High voltages were identified as not suitable due to the excessive oxide thickness, while below 20 V the film was not thick and uniform enough to give a good response. Surface preparation also {{played a major role in}} the observation of memristive properties. Conclusions: Optimal surface preparation and <b>anodizing</b> <b>conditions</b> were seen to give high memristive perfo- mances on both titanium and niobium oxides, while on tantalum oxides no reproducibility was achieved...|$|R
40|$|Anodic TiO 2 {{nanotubes}} (ATNTs) {{have been}} studied extensively for many years. However, their mysterious formation mechanism still remains unclear. The formation of gaps and ribs around the nanotubes has not been elucidated. Here, various surface and cross-section morphologies of ATNTs obtained under different <b>anodizing</b> <b>conditions</b> and their evolution process have been investigated in detail. Based on many experimental facts, new explanations for the gaps and ribs are presented. An entire surface layer covered on the nanotubes plays a primary role on the formation of gaps and ribs. The gaps result from the radial distribution of the electric field at the pore bottom. No newly-formed oxide will exist along the gap direction, because the electric filed along the gap is the minimum. The ribs result from the electrolyte entering into the wider gaps among the ATNTs due to the rupture of the entire surface layer. The rings or ribs on the outer wall of ATNTs are formed at the electrolyte/Ti interface due to the discontinuous existence of {{a small amount of}} electrolyte within the gap base. The present viewpoint was demonstrated by an original micro-dam, which can block the electrolyte entering into the gaps and avoid the formation of ribs. © The Author(s) 2015. Published by ECS.

40|$|International audienceAnodization of {{titanium}} and its alloys is {{an important}} surface treatment, especially for adhesion applications, but is not as well studied as for aluminium alloys. This paper deals with the morphological, structural and physicochemical characterization of anodic oxide films grown on titanium and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V (TA 6 V) in chromic acid solution without (CA) or with (CA/HF) hydrofluoric acid addition, Several investigations methods are used: high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM), reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) and wetting angle measurements. The occurrence and morphology of the nanoporous structure for CA/HF anodization are described. The compact films grown in CA solution are amorphous and the porous films grown in the CA/HF solution are partially crystalline. The thickness and morphology of the films are described and discussed {{as a function of}} the <b>anodizing</b> <b>conditions</b> and of the composition of the underlying substrate. The composition of the film appears to be TiO 2 + Al 2 O 3 (with Ti/Al atomic ratio similar to 5), with incorporation of fluorine from the solution in the porous films and of small quantities of vanadium in the films that are grown. The specific role played by the Cr(VI) and F species on the film growth-and-dissolution formation process is discussed and a growth mechanism is proposed...|$|R
