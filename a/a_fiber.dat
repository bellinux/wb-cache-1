Boeing made use of work done on the cancelled Boeing 7J7 regional jet, which utilized similar versions of the chosen technologies. In 2003, Boeing began offering the option of cockpit electronic flight bag computer displays. In 2013, Boeing announced that the upgraded 777X models would incorporate airframe, systems, and interior technologies from the 787.|$|E

5|$|Fiberglass is <b>a</b> <b>fiber</b> {{reinforced}} polymer made {{of plastic}} reinforced by glass fibers, commonly woven into a mat. The glass fibers used in the material are made of various types of glass depending upon the fiberglass use. These glasses all contain silica or silicate, with varying amounts of oxides of calcium, magnesium, and sometimes boron. The boron is present as borosilicate, borax, or boron oxide, and is added to increase {{the strength of the}} glass, or as a fluxing agent to decrease the melting temperature of silica, which is too high to be easily worked in its pure form to make glass fibers.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to carbon fiber, glass can undergo more elongation before it breaks. Thinner filaments can bend further before they break. The viscosity of the molten glass {{is very important}} for manufacturing success. During drawing, the process where the hot glass is pulled to reduce the diameter of the fiber, the viscosity must be relatively low. If it is too high, the fiber will break during drawing. However, if it is too low, the glass will form droplets instead of being drawn out into <b>a</b> <b>fiber.</b>|$|E
5|$|The City of Ashland {{moved to}} improve local {{broadband}} Internet access {{in the late}} 1990s by creating the Ashland Fiber Network (AFN) and building <b>a</b> <b>fiber</b> optic ring inside the city boundaries. However, by 2006 the city faced difficulties servicing AFN's debt load, which was approaching $15.5million. The city hired a new AFN director, Joe Franell, who suggested scrapping cable television service while retaining the more profitable high-speed Internet access. In October 2006, the cable television service was transferred to a local company, Ashland Home Net, while the City retained both the infrastructure and the wholesale Internet business.|$|E

The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) approved Caltrain's plans in 2014 and Caltrain noted that CBOSS was due to enter revenue service {{by the end of}} 2015. Because Caltrain had multiple goals for CBOSS, including increased safety, improved operational efficiency, and ensured interoperability with other rail providers (Caltrain shares tracks with Union Pacific, Altamont Corridor Express, and Amtrak), implementation was challenging and Caltrain, the busiest commuter rail service on the West Coast, still had not fully implemented the system by the end of 2016.|$|E

5|$|The company DuPont {{and many}} {{industrial}} historians dispute {{a link between}} nylon and hemp. They argue {{that the reason for}} developing nylon was to produce <b>a</b> <b>fiber</b> that could compete with silk and rayon in, for example, thin stockings for women. Silk was much more expensive than hemp and imported largely from Japan. There was more money in a substitute for silk. DuPont focused early on thin stockings for women. As a commercial product, nylon was a revolution in textiles. Strong and water-resistant, it was possible to make very thin fibers from cheap raw materials. The first sales in 1938 in New York of nylon stockings created a line with 4000 middle class women. For years to come, nylon demand was greater than DuPont could produce. And the DuPont Group was very big; it could move on if nylon had not become a success.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} some {{properties of}} <b>a</b> certain <b>fibered</b> hyperbolic 3 -manifold which arises ”in nature”; that is, as {{the cover of}} a closed manifold constructed by other means. Among other things, the main theorem answers in the affirmative the question of whether it is possible for <b>a</b> <b>fibered</b> hyperbolic manifold to be a double across a connected surface. (We first heard this question from Alan Reid.) Non-hyperbolic fibered doubles are easily constructed by doubling the exterior of <b>a</b> <b>fibered</b> knot across the boundary torus, but producing <b>a</b> <b>fibered</b> hyperbolic double is more subtle problem. In such a manifold the doubling surface — necessarily with genus at least 2 — does not itself admit <b>a</b> <b>fibering</b> and must thus have points of tangency with any fibering, which in particular cannot be invariant under the doubling involution. Our objects of study come from a family of hyperbolic 3 -manifolds Mn,k with totally geodesic boundary defined by Paoluzzi-Zimmermann [12]. A well known member of this family is M 3, 1, which is Thurston’s “tripus ” ([15], Ch. 3). Here we consider the ”tetrus ” M 4, 1 (thanks to Richard Kent for namin...|$|R
