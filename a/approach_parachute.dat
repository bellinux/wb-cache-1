50|$|By September 1955, the {{reconnaissance}} platoon, {{commanded by}} Captain Joseph Z. Taylor, {{was added to}} resolve the amphibious reconnaissance role in the Fleet Marine Force. It was also tasked to bring the past force-level preliminary amphib recon methods of World War II towards a modern <b>approach</b> that included <b>parachute</b> insertions and helicopter capabilities.|$|R
500|$|At 09:00 one {{battalion}} of the 857th Grenadier Regiment {{had crossed the}} drop zone and <b>approached</b> the 5th <b>Parachute</b> Brigades positions. Its two forward units, the 7th Parachute Battalion and the 13th Parachute Battalion, held their fire until the Germans were only [...] away. The few survivors of the onslaught escaped into the nearby woods.|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} was conducted {{with the objective of}} upgrading and improving the loads, stress, and performance prediction methods for Apollo spacecraft parachutes. The subjects considered were: (1) methods for a new theoretical <b>approach</b> to the <b>parachute</b> opening process, (2) new experimental-analytical techniques to improve the measurement of pressures, stresses, and strains in inflight parachutes, and (3) a numerical method for analyzing the dynamical behavior of rapidly loaded pilot chute risers...|$|R
5000|$|In late 2011, SpaceX {{announced}} {{a change in}} the <b>approach,</b> eliminating the <b>parachutes</b> and going with a propulsively-powered-descent approach. Included was a video said to be an approximation depicting the first stage returning tail-first for a powered descent and the second stage, with heat shield, reentering head first before rotating for a powered descent. Design was complete on the system for [...] "bringing the rocket back to launchpad using only thrusters" [...] by February 2012.|$|R
5000|$|... 15 March 1964 - Lt. George L. Neale, 29, {{was killed}} during an {{attempted}} emergency landing at Apalach Airport near Apalachicola, Florida. Lt. Neale's F-11A Tiger had experienced mechanical difficulties during {{a flight from}} West Palm Beach, Florida to NAS Pensacola, causing him to attempt the emergency landing. Failing to reach the airport, he ejected from the aircraft on final <b>approach,</b> but his <b>parachute</b> did not have sufficient time to fully deploy.|$|R
40|$|Human rating {{begins with}} design. Converging on the {{requirements}} and identifying the risks {{as early as}} possible in the design process is essential. Understanding of the interaction between the recovery system and the spacecraft will in large part dictate the achievable reliability of the final design. Component and complete system full-scale flight testing is critical to assure a realistic evaluation of the performance and reliability of the parachute system. However, because testing is so often difficult and expensive, comprehensive analysis of test results and correlation to accurate modeling completes the human rating process. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Orion program uses parachutes to stabilize and decelerate the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) spacecraft during subsonic flight in order to deliver a safe water landing. This paper describes the <b>approach</b> that CEV <b>Parachute</b> Assembly System (CPAS) will take to human rate the parachute recovery system for the CEV...|$|R
40|$|Traditional agency models {{focus on}} the {{conceptual}} line of delegation running from principal to agent. The more information about agents’ preferences and actions, the better able the principals to use selection and sanctioning to achieve desirable outcomes. Following this conventional wisdom, institutional transparency is viewed as an unequivocal good and representative democracy as built on delegation and control. However, this is an incomplete picture at best. Game-theoretic and case analysis shows that the elevation of the elected European Parliament as a legislative chamber coequal to the intergovernmental Council of the European Union may be a ruse to undermine lobbyist influence by diluting formal responsibility. Less transparency in decision-making may help align EU policy closer to broader societal objectives. The Commission, perhaps most heavily influenced by special interests, and not Council has lost clout in the legislative process {{as a result of}} the changes. In several generalized noncooperative formal settings with information asymmetries, delegation can work for principals only if the set of potential agents is diverse. Not only does selection dominate sanctioning as a control mechanism, but the very existence of compliance equilibria is contingent upon the a priori arrangement of candidate agents’ policy preferences relative to one another and to the principals’. The principal–agent relationship is dependent on and may be only secondary to between-agent competition. This insight has far-reaching implications for a number of research programs within political science. Schumpeter viewed modern democracy as a system where elites compete for the support of the masses. This conceptualization suggests a new path towards sustainable democratization. Building elite capacity in undemocratic conditions through institutionalized, if unfair, competition may be a more effective <b>approach</b> than <b>parachuting</b> fully democratic institutions in an unreceptive environment. Empirical analysis of over two hundred years of data shows that states with competitive political institutions, regardless of whether those are democratic, are most likely to develop and sustain full-fledged democracy...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a resume}} {{of the work}} of the Bureau of Standards on a cotton {{parachute}} cloth for use as a substitute for silk {{in the event of an}} emergency curtailing the supply. Cotton yarn of high strength in proportion to its weight and otherwise specially suitable for parachute cloth was developed. Cloth woven from this yarn in the bureau mill was equal or superior to parachute silk in strength and tear resistance, met the requirements with respect to air permeability, and weighed only a few tenths of an ounce per square yard more than the silk cloth. Practical trials of cotton parachutes carried out by the Navy Department clearly indicate that the cotton <b>parachute</b> closely <b>approaches</b> the silk <b>parachute</b> in performance as to rate of descent, opening time, strength and ability to function when stored in the pack for sixty days. The increase in weight of the equipment resulting from the use of cotton cloth instead of silk is considered to be well within practicable limits. A specification for cotton parachute cloth and the way in which the requirements of the specification have been met are given. Cotton yarns suitable for parachute cloth are now being woven commercially in the United States...|$|R
40|$|We present three {{innovative}} {{approaches for}} simulations of parachute fluid-structure interactions (FSI), which otherwise {{tend to be}} unstable because of extreme sensitivity of thin membrane structure to massive fluid dynamic forces. In the first approach, we use an iterative scheme in conjunction with augmented structural mass matrix to achieve convergence in coupling the fluid and the structure motion. In the second approach, we use a coupled formulation that includes the inter-dependence of fluid and structure motion. The dependence of flow on domain deformation is addressed iteratively in this approach. Finally in the third approach, we use a directly coupled formulation that fully incorporates the inter-dependence of fluid, structure and mesh motion. All the three <b>approaches</b> accurately predict <b>parachute</b> FSI and successful FSI simulations of soft landing of T- 10, G- 12 and G- 11 parachutes are presented to provide corroborating evidence. To further {{improve the quality of}} FSI simulations, carried out using any of the three coupling approaches, we present more enhanced-discretization and solution techniques. We present definitions of the stabilization parameters used in SUPG and PSPG formulations based on local length scales that are shown to be accurate and less dissipative. We also present an Enhanced-Discretization Space-Time Technique (EDSTT) that has tremendous potential in saving significant amount of computational time as it allows us to use different time-step sizes in different regions of a computational domain. Complementary to EDSTT, we propose an Enhanced-Discretization Successive Update Method (EDSUM) which resolves small scale information in flow simulations. We have also described a variation of EDSUM that gives dramatic rates of convergence in solving linear equation systems. Another effort toward accurately solving linear equation systems is the Enhanced-Approximation Linear Solution Technique (EALST) that we propose for improving the convergence in selected regions of the flow. All these techniques are successfully tested on a variety of problems and the results obtained are unequivocally satisfactory...|$|R
