It is found that, for both normal and <b>anomalous</b> <b>dispersions,</b> space-time focusing may lead to the appearance of new temporal instability regions for some range of spatial frequencies. The physical origin of the new instability regions lies in the part of spacetime coupling related to the fourth-order dispersion. Furthermore, space-time focusing shrinks the instability regions and slightly reduces the maximum growth rates of the original spatiotemporal instability gain spectra obtained from the standard NLSE...|$|R

At X-ray frequencies, the refractive index becomes less than unity (note that in media the phase velocity may exceed c without violating relativity) and hence no X-ray emission (or shorter wavelength emissions such as gamma rays) would be observed. However, X-rays can be generated at special frequencies just below the frequencies corresponding to core electronic transitions in a material, as the index of refraction is often greater than 1 just below a resonant frequency (see Kramers-Kronig relation and <b>anomalous</b> <b>dispersion).</b>|$|E

40|$|We use the {{coupling}} matrix formalism to investigate continuous-wave and pulse propagation through microring coupled-resonator optical waveguides (CROWs). The dispersion relation agrees with that derived using the tight-binding {{model in the}} limit of weak inter-resonator coupling. We obtain an analytical expression for pulse propagation through a semi-infinite CROW in the case of weak coupling which fully accounts for the nonlinear dispersive characteristics. We also show that intensity of a pulse in a CROW is enhanced by a factor inversely proportional to the inter-resonator coupling. In finite CROWs, <b>anomalous</b> <b>dispersions</b> allows for a pulse to propagate with a negative group velocity such that the output pulse appears to emerge before the input as in “superluminal” propagation. The matrix formalism is a powerful approach for microring CROWs since it can be applied to structures and geometries for which analyses with the commonly used tight-binding approach are not applicable...|$|R

This discrepancy is caused by the existence of partially molten materials and by the preferred orientation of crystal axes of olivines within the asthenosphere. From the wave form analyses two types are found in the wave forms of Love waves. One forms isolated waves and the other merely oscillated waves showing no clear normal or <b>anomalous</b> <b>dispersions.</b> The latter type presents a few peculiar dispersion curves with exceptionally high and low group velocities of 4. 9 and 4. 1 km/sec respectively around a period of 70 seconds. 表面波異方 1 生を研究する為に,西太平洋を伝播した基本及び高次モードラブ波を詳しく解析した. 観測された波と理論記象の波形,及び群速度のイソバージョンから次の事が明らかになった。即ち,海底年代が九千万年から一億五千万年に相当する地域の低速度層のS波速度は 4. 43 km/secであり,これはレイリー波から求められている値より 2 ～ 3 %高い. この食い違いはアセノスフェア内における部分溶融相の存在と橄欖石等の結晶軸の定向性によって生じている. 波形解析よりラブ波の波形には二つの形状がある事が見い出された. 一つは孤立波であり,他の一つは正分散も逆分散もせず単に振動している波群である. 後者のタイプでは,周期 70 秒付近で群速度が 4. 9 km/secとか 4. 1 km/secとか例外的に高い値や低い値をもつ異常な分散曲線を示すものが若干みられた...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that the coupling between light and intersubband excitations in semiconductors is fundamentally different from the well understood coupling to interband transitions that leads to excitonic polaritons. Numerical results for III-V quantum wells under nonequilibrium conditions are given by direct evaluation of analytical approximations obtained from a Keldysh Green's-function formalism. It is shown that bosonic approximations required for a Hamiltonian theory can be manipulated and turned "on and off" in the regime of excitations where the signatures of the coupling are stable and well defined. This {{is in contrast to}} interband polaritons, whose dispersions lose resolution as the exciton absorption is bleached and the bosonic approximation is violated. Thus, bosonic effects can be, in principle, controlled by manipulating the intersubband carrier injection. Furthermore, the evolution of the quasiparticle with injected carrier density is opposite to that of the conventional polariton. The approach consistently describes dispersions found experimentally if light is absorbed due to intersubband transitions and predicts <b>anomalous</b> <b>dispersions</b> under population inversion conditions. A more appropriate intersubband antipolariton is introduced to describe the light-intersubband excitation coupling. The influence of the dominant many-body effects on the quasiparticle dispersion is also discussed...|$|R
