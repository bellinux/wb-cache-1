During his tenure, {{the park system}} {{increased}} from 1810 acres (7.3km²) in 57 properties to 5421 acres (21.9km²) in 144 properties. The park system, organized around the Minneapolis chain of lakes (including Cedar Lake, Lake of the Isles, Lake Calhoun, Lake Harriet, Lake Hiawatha, and Lake Nokomis) became a model for park planners around the world. He also encouraged active recreation in the parks, <b>as</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> setting aside parks for passive admiration.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of osteoarthritis is correlated {{with a history}} of previous joint injury and with obesity, especially with respect to knees. Since the correlation with obesity has been observed not only for knees but also for non-weight bearing joints and the loss of body fat is more closely related to symptom relief than the loss of body weight, {{it has been suggested that}} there may be a metabolic link to body fat <b>as</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> mechanical loading.|$|E

Corporate magicians may come from a business background and typically present at meetings, conferences and product launches.

Pioneer performers in this arena include Eddie Tullock and Guy Bavli.|$|E
25|$|In 832, a Viking {{fleet of}} about 120 invaded kingdoms on Ireland's {{northern}} and eastern coasts. Some {{believe that the}} increased number of invaders coincided with Scandinavian leaders' desires to control the profitable raids on the western shores of Ireland. During the mid-830s, raids began to push deeper into Ireland, <b>as</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> touching the coasts. Navigable waterways made this deeper penetration possible. After 840, the Vikings had several bases in strategic locations dispersed throughout Ireland.|$|E

As with earlier Cray designs, the Cray-1 made sure that the entire computer was fast, <b>as</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> the processor. When it was released it easily beat almost every machine in terms of speed, including the STAR-100 that had beaten the 8600 for funding. The only machine able to perform on {{the same sort of}} level was the ILLIAC IV, a specialized one-off machine that rarely operated near its maximum performance, except on very specific tasks. In general, the Cray-1 beat anything on the market by a wide margin.|$|E

Engineering and Engineering Technology programs and as a desired skill for employment in industry. As part of the NJIT's Gateway Engineering Coalition grant, with support from the National Science Foundation, a mini-workshop was given to over 100 engineering freshman students. This mini-workshop was also given to upper division engineering technology transfer students. The concept of the lecture was to initially teach students how <b>to</b> present, <b>as</b> <b>oppose</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> how <b>to</b> use various presentation software applications. This presentation covers seven key areas that relate to presentations, primarily in a technical environment. This paper will review the material presented to these students...|$|R

25|$|The {{constitution}} of the Helvetic Republic came mainly from the design of Peter Ochs, a magistrate from Basel. It established a central two-chamber legislature which included the Grand Council (with 8 members per canton) and the Senate (4 members per canton). The executive, known as the Directory, comprised 5 members. The Constitution also established actual Swiss citizenship, <b>as</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> citizenship of one's canton of birth. With Swiss citizenship came the absolute freedom to settle in any canton, the political communes were now composed of all residents, and not merely of the burghers. However, the community land and property remained with the former local burghers who were gathered together into the Bürgergemeinde.|$|E

This rolling stock, originally produced by General Electric in two batches (144 in 1972–73 and 100 in 1975–77), was initially branded as the M2 Cosmopolitan, with later versions being made on license by Tokyu Car (model M4, 1988) and Morrison-Knudsen (model M6, 1994). Cosmopolitans can be easily spotted by their red stripe along the side, the presence of pantographs on the lead cars in each set, and a dynamic braking grid on the roof.|$|E
25|$|The {{band had}} {{originally}} planned to self-title their previous album, Documentaly (2011), {{due to the}} album's documentary theme.

For their next album, they decided to revisit this idea. This was due to the band's greater exposure in Japan through their commercial tie-ups, which would mean a great number of people would be listening to Sakanaction for the first time for this album. Yamaguchi described making music for this new audience as feeling like the band were releasing their first album again, which strengthened their desire to self-title this release.|$|E

50|$|Audience {{continued}} to demand more of Quang Lê. The release of “7000 Ðêm Góp Lại” brought Quang Lê {{to a much}} more broad audience, <b>as</b> <b>oppose</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> the older generation. He {{continued to}} sing “Quê Hương” songs such as “Thành Phố Sau Lưng” and “Xin Em Đừng Khóc Vu Quy” {{as well as a}} duet with another famous “Quê Hương” singer, Như Quỳnh” in the song “Đêm Bơ Vơ” from Duy Khánh. Quang Lê also sang with singer Hương Thủy in a very sweet cover and upbeat pop song “Tình Nhỏ Mau Quên”. Quang Lê provided a unique remixed to the song “Xin Đừng Trách Đa Đa” by adding a trance mix to it, very different from what the audience expects from him. He also provided to the audience a romantic ballad in “Hãy Về Đây Bên Anh” from Duy Manh, which attracted a different audience, mainly from the younger generation.|$|R
25|$|In {{an effort}} to make the game look more realistic, many of the real players in the game had their entire body scanned into the game, <b>as</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> the face like in {{previous}} NBA 2K games. A first for the NBA 2K series, the full body scanning allows the entire body of a specific player to be uniquely different from any other body. In previous NBA 2K games, a player's face was unique, while the body was generic and predefined. The full body scanning improves details in players' tattoos as well, something that has been criticized in past NBA 2K games. Cheerleaders, coaches, and fans were also scanned into the game; the designs of cheerleaders, coaches, and the crowd have too been criticized in past games.|$|E

A 2011 {{systematic review}} found moderate {{evidence to support the}} use of manual therapy for cervicogenic dizziness. There is very weak evidence for chiropractic care for adult scoliosis (curved or rotated spine) and no scientific data for idiopathic adolescent scoliosis. A 2007 systematic review found that few studies of chiropractic care for nonmusculoskeletal conditions are available, and they are typically not of high quality; it also found that the entire clinical encounter of chiropractic care (<b>as</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> SM) provides benefit to patients with cervicogenic dizziness, and that the evidence from reviews is negative, or too weak to draw conclusions, {{for a wide variety of}} other nonmusculoskeletal conditions, including ADHD/learning disabilities, dizziness, high blood pressure, and vision conditions. Other reviews have found no evidence of significant benefit for asthma, baby colic, bedwetting, carpal tunnel syndrome, fibromyalgia, gastrointestinal disorders, kinetic imbalance due to suboccipital strain (KISS) in infants, menstrual cramps, insomnia, postmenopausal symptoms, or pelvic and back pain during pregnancy. As there is no evidence of effectiveness or safety for cervical manipulation for baby colic, it is not endorsed.|$|E
25|$|The Bangladesh Cricket Board {{founded the}} six-team Bangladesh Premier League in 2012, a twenty20 tournament {{to be held}} in February that year. An auction was held for teams to buy players, and Mortaza was bought by the Dhaka Gladiators for $45,000. On his return to {{competitive}} cricket Mortaza was made captain of Dhaka Gladiators. Before the tournament had started, he reported to have been approached with a request to participate in spot-fixing. Led by Mortaza, who took ten wickets from eleven matches, Dhaka won the BPL's inaugural season. Shortly after the tournament concluded, Bangladesh hosted the 2012 Asia Cup; after losing to Pakistan the previous December, five new players called into Bangladesh's 15-man squad, including Mortaza who was making his come back to the national side after injury. When the BCB announced its central contracts for 2012 in March, Mortaza retained his top level contract. Against expectations Bangladesh progressed to the cup final against Pakistan; it was just the second time Bangladesh had reached the final of a tournament. Though he had played in the BPL, bowling ten overs in the ODIs <b>as</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> four per match proved to be a challenge for Mortaza. Though in the penultimate game he struggled he regained full fitness to bowl in the final, and finished as Bangladesh's leading seamer with six wickets from four matches.|$|E

Mears said the energy from the actor's thoughts will be picked up by the camera. He compared his experience behind the camera to a stock car race: he is the driver and the effects team is his pit crew. As he performs, the effects team subtly suggest ways he can give the character more life on camera.|$|E
