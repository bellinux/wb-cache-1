50|$|The {{antihistamine}} agent terfenadine produces <b>azacyclonol</b> as {{an active}} major metabolite.|$|E
50|$|<b>Azacyclonol</b> (trade names Ataractan, Calmeran, Frenoton, Frenquel, Psychosan), {{also known}} as Î³-pipradrol, is a drug which is an ataractive; an agent which diminishes {{hallucinations}} in psychotic individuals. It has also been called a tranquilizer and antipsychotic, though these definitions are not accurate as it does not actually possess such properties. Despite being a positional isomer of pipradrol, {{it is not a}} psychostimulant, and instead has mild depressant effects.|$|E
5000|$|Isbell and Logan (1957) {{reported}} that chlorpromazine (Thorazine) could either block or reverse {{the effects of}} LSD. <b>Azacyclonol</b> had no effect, while pre-treatment with reserpine augmented the effects of LSD (though in a manner described as [...] "unpleasant"). Isbell et al. (1959b) {{reported that}} pre-treatment with scopolamine (an acetylcholine antagonist), phenoxybenzamine (an adrenergic alpha blocker) or [...] "BAS" [...] (a 5-methoxytryptamine based serotonin antagonist) {{had little effect on}} a subsequent LSD dose. They attempt to explain these results within the neurotransmitter ("neurohumors") knowledge of the period.|$|E
40|$|Transmission {{through the}} cat {{superior}} cervical ganglion was studied by recording {{the response of}} the nictitating membrane to both pre- and postganglionic cervical sympathetic nerve stimulation. The intra-arterial injection of central depressant drugs to the ganglion through the lingual artery depressed transmission through the ganglion. The central depressant drugs tested were (in decreasing order of activity) : amylobarbitone, pentobarbitone, carbromal, benactyzine, mephobarbitone, hydroxyzine, phenobarbitone, <b>azacyclonol,</b> methylpentynol carbamate, paraldehyde, phenytoin, mephenesin, chlorbutol, troxidone, methylpentynol and barbitone. All were weaker ganglion-blocking agents than tetraethylammonium. The intra-arterial injection of the central stimulant drugs leptazol, bemegride, amiphenazole and 5 -(1, 3 -dimethylbut- 2 -enyl) - 5 -ethylbarbituric acid (McN 481) also depressed ganglionic transmission. Leptazol or bemegride did not antagonize the ganglion-blocking action of amylobarbitone or troxidone. The intra-arterial injection of pecazine and perphenazine, and the intravenous injection of barbitone, benactyzine, <b>azacyclonol,</b> hydroxyzine, mephenesin, methylpentynol and paraldehyde impaired {{the response of the}} nictitating membrane to both post- and preganglionic stimulation. The implications of these observations are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In the cat, the pressor {{actions of}} {{noradrenaline}} and of adrenaline were generally reduced {{and that of}} tyramine was increased during infusions either of noradrenaline or of adrenaline. The increase in the response to tyramine after an infusion of noradrenaline was prevented by cocaine, methyl phenidate and pipradrol. Pipradrol, unlike its isomer <b>azacyclonol,</b> increased the responses to catechol amines but reduced that to tyramine. Cocaine did not prevent {{the increase in the}} noradrenaline content of cat kidney and uterus after an infusion of noradrenaline. In the pithed rat, cocaine increased the pressor response to noradrenaline but antagonized that to tyramine. Treatment of the rat with reserpine prevented the effect of cocaine on the response to tyramine but did not modify the potentiation of the response to noradrenaline. Prolonged treatment with cocaine did not lower the tissue noradrenaline levels and did not prevent the noradrenaline depletion by reserpine. It is suggested that interactions between cocaine, tyramine and noradrenaline occur at the point where noradrenaline enters its tissue store...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies from}} this {{laboratory}} {{have shown that}} it is possible to induce a graded deficit in the conditioned avoidance reaction of the rhesus monkey by the use of reserpine at various dose levels. Furthermore, we have shown that animals with cortical lesions were less affected by reserpine than were normal monkeys. These findings encouraged us to attempt assays of compounds struc-turally similar to reserpine and also of other compounds used for their depressant or tranquillizing effects. Reserpine 2, desmethoxyreserpine (recanescine) 3, res-cinnamine 3, chlorpromazine 4, <b>azacyclonol</b> 5, and pentobarbital 6 were assayed in both normal and cortically damaged monkeys. The same 16 monkeys as were used in our previous study of reserpine (Smith et al., 1956) were used in the present experiments. Approximately one month elapsed between the conclusion of the previous and the beginning of the present studies. Animals were not drugged in the intervening period. Three approaches to the problem were at-attempted. First, we wished to compare the potencies of several Rauwolfia deriv-atives at a single dose level. Secondly, we attempted to determine whether differ...|$|E
