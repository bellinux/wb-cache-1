2500|$|Suppose we {{walk along}} the contour line with [...] We are {{interested}} in finding points where [...] does not change <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk,</b> since these points might be maxima. There are two ways this could happen: First, we could be following a contour line of , since by definition [...] does not change <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> along its contour lines.

2500|$|We {{are still}} {{interested}} in finding points where [...] does not change <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk,</b> since these points might be (constrained) extrema.

60|$|And <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> {{away from}} the hotel I related the {{particulars}} about the note-book.|$|R
60|$|He was wearied {{with the}} {{fatigues}} of the day, and, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> out, {{fell into a}} fit of gloomy musing.|$|R
60|$|And here {{he seems}} to vanish. The little, boyish self that has grown up beside me <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> is gone.|$|R
60|$|Wood. Thou wert predestinated for a husband, I see, by {{that natural}} instinct: <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk,</b> I will {{instruct}} thee {{how to behave}} thyself, with secrecy and silence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never; {{but come}} along, I must finish {{one part of}} my duty here without delay by paying a visit. You can {{tell me about the}} wrestling-match <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are {{you going}} with me?" [...] said Yeobright, paying no {{attention}} to the captain's latter remark. [...] "If so I can tell you what we quarrelled about <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> along." ...|$|E
60|$|One day <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> {{together}} in the garden--my Lord Gambara and I--I asked him plainly what was Messer Farnese's claim.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mother will be proud, indeed,' he said, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> away together. 'Or {{she would}} be proud, if it wasn't sinful, Master Copperfield.' ...|$|R
60|$|The remark {{being made}} to me in {{consequence}} of my being next him <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked,</b> I assented and enumerated its chief attractions.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Will {{you allow}} Me {{to walk a}} little way in {{whatever}} direction you may be going? I can then speak to you <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk,</b> both without detaining you here, and without intruding longer here myself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we {{have seen}} some very {{interesting}} things. I'll {{tell you what we}} did <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk.</b> First of all, we saw the body of this unfortunate man. He certainly died from a revolver wound as reported." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A great deal,' replied Kate; 'but not now. I {{would rather}} {{speak to him}} when we are alone;--it will save his time if I thank him and say what I wish to say to him, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> along.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Miss Summerson," [...] {{he said to}} me <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> quickly away. [...] "They've got her ladyship's watch among 'em. That's a {{positive}} fact." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All the same, I wish {{something}} exciting would happen," [...] {{finished the}} Story Girl, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> {{up through the}} orchard, peopled with its nun-like shadows.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now you see {{all your}} penance was wasted," [...] said Felicity, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> home, keeping close {{together}} because of the rumour that Peg Bowen was abroad.|$|R
6000|$|... "All that I have to say," [...] Selingman went on, [...] "is not yet said. This {{opportunity}} of meeting you is too precious to be wasted. Come. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> {{there are certain}} questions I wish to put to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|William {{passed his}} hand across his eyes, and murmured with august satisfaction, 'Blessings on your attachment, my poor dear fellow!' Then he said aloud, 'Well, my dear Frederick, if you will only try, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> out, {{to show that you}} are alive to the occasion--that you think about it--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The truth is, my dear sir," [...] said Brook good-humouredly, [...] "that you've made {{a slight}} mistake in this matter. Carrot-seed is usually sown in {{trenches}} {{less than an}} inch deep. You'd better leave off work just now and come over to my place at once. I'll give you some useful hints <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me congratulate you, Mr. Hawkins," [...] {{said the}} captain to the mate <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> homewards. [...] "You are to command your own ship within the year." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then I playfully tried verbal {{instruction}} in domestic matters, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> about on a Saturday afternoon. Sometimes, for example, when {{we passed a}} butcher's shop, I would say: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} {{not to be}} able to accept your invitation," [...] I said, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> {{together}} to the door. [...] "Perhaps you will give me another chance?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{the top of}} the mountain, of course, whence I came. Oh! please don't stop to {{question}} me, I'll tell you <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk.</b> Stay," [...] and she called to the Zulu driver, who with an air of utter amazement was engaged in milking one of the gift cows, to fill two bottles with the milk.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, {{but they}} say I have won my spurs. I'll tell you all, Lily, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk.</b> Only let me bestow this iron cap where some mavis may nestle in it. Ay, and the boots too, which scarce befit a clerk. There, your hand, Clerk Davie; we must make westward to-day, lest poor Duke Murdoch be forced to send to chase us. After that, for the Border and Patie.' ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{they met}} {{again in the}} {{workshop}} the armourer said: [...] "Clean yourself up after breakfast, Walter, and put on your best clothes. I will go with you before the mayor, and then you shall tell him your story. There {{is sure to be}} a stir about it before the day is done. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> thither we can settle how much of your story it is good to tell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yell, {{that is a}} rum go!" [...] exclaimed {{my little}} companion, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> slowly away. [...] "Don't it seem to you, now, as if it wor all a dream?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's one thing," [...] said I, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> {{down to the}} station. [...] "If the husband's {{name was}} James, {{and the other was}} Henry, what was this talk about David?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What sort of {{amusement}} is this surf-swimming?" [...] I inquired of Bill <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> together to {{a part of}} the shore on which several thousands of the natives were assembled.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look after yourself, lad, {{and give}} over being soft-hearted about such curs. We've got no easy job before us, and are needing {{every moment of}} time." [...] Then to Master Lord he added, [...] "If you are minded to make any noise <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> through the streets, {{remember}} what I have threatened to do, and understand that it's my belief I'd be doing a good deed to put {{you out of the}} world!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Honestly, my dear Chris, {{perfectly}} honestly. The {{rifles and}} clothes were fairly spoils of war, the loaves and spirits {{were stolen from}} a thief, which I consider to be a good action; but let us go on, I will tell you about it <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk.</b> Here is your bandolier, slip that on first; there is your coat and hat. Now I will put the sling of the rifle over your shoulder. There you are, complete, a Boer of the first water! I will carry the bottles and the bread. Now, let's be going on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will go to}} England together," [...] he whispered, [...] "and {{there we}} will be happy together, you and I. We will have a tiny house among the Kentish hills, and its walls will be covered with {{honeysuckle}} and roses. At {{the back of the}} house there will be an orchard, and in May, when the fruit-blossom is fading and soft spring breezes blow among the trees, showers of sweet-scented petals will envelop us <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> along, falling on us like fragrant snow. You will come, sweetheart, will you not?" ...|$|E
60|$|In this {{arrangement}} <b>we</b> rested, and <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> {{back to camp}} I cared nothing for the sly words or glances of our fellow artists. I believed I had won my case.|$|R
60|$|We made few halts, {{and then}} {{only for a few}} moments at a time. <b>We</b> ate <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked,</b> forcing our way through the dense underbrush, and ever on the alert against danger.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hugh," [...] said Leonard Dickinson to me <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> to {{the bank}} together, [...] "Scherer will never be any good any more. Too much prosperity. And he's begun to have his nails manicured." ...|$|R
