5|$|The Octopus card won the Chairman's Award of the World Information Technology and Services Alliance's 2006 Global IT Excellence Award for, {{among other}} things, being the world's leading complex <b>automatic</b> <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> and {{contactless}} smartcard payment system. According to Octopus Cards Limited, operator of the Octopus card system, {{there are more}} than 20 million cards in circulation, nearly three times the population of Hong Kong. The cards are used by 95% of the population of Hong Kong aged 16 to 65, generating over 12 million daily transactions worth a total over HK$130 million.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, {{with the}} rapid {{development}} of Taipei, a white paper for transport policies expressed the strong objective to [...] "create a civilised transport system {{for the people of}} Taipei." [...] In 1999, they chose Mitac consortium, which Thales-Transportation Systems is part of. Thales was then selected again in 2005 to deploy an upgrade of Taipei's public transport network with an end-to-end and fully contactless <b>automatic</b> <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> solution that integrates 116 metro stations, 5,000 buses and 92 car parks.|$|E
30|$|Statistical {{surveys are}} based on {{rigorous}} scientific principles; however, the presence of inevitable errors (e.g. sampling error), {{the high cost of}} collecting adequate sampling, and the difficulty of securing the effective cooperation of respondents make these surveys a challenging phase of transportation studies. The widespread use of intelligent transportation systems however allows researchers to extract useful information about citizens’ travel behavior without the need for any direct engagement. Recently, the presence of automated vehicle location systems, <b>automatic</b> transit <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> systems, speed cameras and license plate scanners provide unprecedented access to raw data necessary for the study of traffic behaviors.|$|R
40|$|The {{advancement}} of sensor technologies {{makes it possible}} to collect large amounts of dynamic urban data. On the other hand, how to store, process, and analyze collected urban data to make them useful becomes a new challenge. To address this issue, this paper proposes a visual analytics framework, which is applied to transportation data to manage and extract information for urban studies. More specifically, the proposed framework has three components: (1) a geographic information system (GIS) based pipeline providing basic data processing functions; (2) a spatial network analysis that is integrated into the pipeline for extracting spatial structure of urban movement; (3) interactive operations allowing the user to explore and view the output data sets at different levels of details. Taking Singapore as a case study area, we use a sample data set from the <b>automatic</b> smart card <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> system as an input to our prototype tool. The result shows the feasibility of proposed framework and analysis method. To summarize, our work shows the potential of geospatial based visual analytics tools in using "big" data for urban analysis...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2008, in {{anticipation}} of the Summer Olympic Games, three new lines—Line10, the Olympic Branch Line and the Airport Express—opened on July19 for trial operation. The use of paper tickets, hand checked by clerks for 38 years, was discontinued and replaced by electronic tickets that are scanned by <b>automatic</b> <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> machines upon entry and exit of the subway. [...] Stations are outfitted with touch screen vending machines that sell single-ride tickets and multiple-ride Yikatong fare cards. The subway set a daily ridership record of 4.92million on August22, 2008, the day of the Games' closing ceremony In 2008, total ridership rose by 75% to 1.2billion.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{renaming}} {{the city}} from Bombay to Mumbai in 1995, the organisation was also renamed to [...] "Brihanmumbai Electric Supply & Transport (BEST)".Following a Supreme Court directive, the company gradually phased out old buses and introduced new buses which comply with the Euro III pollution control standards. In 19 November 2004, route SPL-8 travelling from Churchgate to World Trade Centre has started accepting cashless smart cards for <b>automatic</b> <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> in BEST buses. * Due to the 9/11 bombings, BEST has installed an audio-visual surveillance system (CCTV) on each of its buses to monitor suspicious behaviour on board its vehicles. BEST currently has over 1500 environmentally friendly Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) buses on its fleet and plans {{to increase the number}} of buses. Almost all buses have two LCD TVs per bus. BEST buses are well maintained buses. Air conditioned buses are very popular with office goers. The A/C bus [...] "AS-4" [...] from Oshiwara Depot to Backbay Depot, is the route with the highest revenue for BEST. The [...] "AS-4" [...] is most popular bus with morning office goers, as it covers a distance of about 30km from Andheri to Mantralaya in only one and half hours. BEST has introduced A/C Cerita services on certain routes.|$|E

Major findings include: (1) a wide variation in the <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> systems and equipment, caused primarily by historical precedence; (2) the reliability of AFC equipment used at BART and WMATA discouraged other properties from considering use of similar equipment; (3) existing equipment may not meet the <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> needs of properties in the near future; (4) the cost of <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> operation and maintenance is high; and (5) the relatively small market in <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> equipment discourages new product development by suppliers. Recommendations for <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> R&D programs include development of new hardware to meet rail transit needs, study of impacts of alternate fare policies increased communication among policymakers, and consensus on fare policy issues...|$|R

50|$|In the past, public {{transport}} systems were often implemented using standalone, proprietary <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> systems. In such cases, each <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> system employed unique fare media (such {{as its own}} style of ticket printed on card) and data management systems. Because <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> systems did not interoperate with each other, payment schemes and tokens varied widely between local and regional systems, and new systems were often costly to develop and maintain.|$|R
