5|$|Blue {{whales are}} {{rorquals}} (family Balaenopteridae), {{a family that}} includes the humpback whale, the fin whale, Bryde's whale, the sei whale, and the minke whale.

5|$|Fin {{whales are}} rorquals, {{members of the}} family Balaenopteridae, which also {{includes}} the humpback whale, the blue whale, Bryde's whale, the sei whale, and the minke whales.

5|$|Nueces Bay formed {{approximately}} 9,000 years <b>ago,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{sea level}} rose {{at the conclusion}} of the last ice age. The sea level stabilized 6,000 years later, shaping the present-day Nueces Bay. The first human inhabitants were the nomadic Aransas Indians, who settled between the Copano and Baffin bays about 8,000 years ago, until 1300 CE. In the next century, the Karankawa Indians arrived, and were present when Europeans came ashore.|$|E

50|$|The work is {{a history}} of Spain chiefly over the course of 2000 years, though with some {{consideration}} of earlier periods; one part of it, for instance, describes the existence of Homo antecessor (a predecessor of human beings) who has been unearthed as living in what is now Spain 800,000 years <b>ago,</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> discovery of Neanderthal remains in a place such as Gibraltar.|$|R

5|$|Blowing from a gun was a {{reported}} means of execution as long <b>ago</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 16th century, by the Mughal Empire, {{and was used}} until the 20th century. The method was utilized by Portuguese colonialists in the 16th and 17th centuries, from as early as 1509 across their empire from Ceylon (modern day Sri Lanka) to Mozambique to Brazil. The Mughals used the method throughout the 17th century and into the 18th, particularly against rebels.|$|E
5|$|Geologically, {{the canyon}} likely {{originated}} {{millions of years}} <b>ago</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> result of San Diego Creek cutting through the San Joaquin Hills. Uplift diverted that stream to its present course, leaving Laguna Canyon as a wind gap.

A majority of the canyon is located within the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park; small portions are part of Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park and the cities of Irvine, Laguna Beach, Laguna Woods and Aliso Viejo.|$|E

5|$|Laboratory {{breeding}} {{experiments with}} it and other Omphalotus species have revealed {{a low level of}} compatibility (ability to breed and produce fertile hybrids), suggesting it is genetically distinct and has been isolated for a long time. It is particularly poorly compatible with O.illudens, the authors of the study suggesting the separation may have been as long <b>ago</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Late Carboniferous separation of Gondwana from Laurasia but conceding the lack of any fossil record makes it impossible to know whether the genus even existed at the time.|$|E
5|$|Lake Manly and {{its sister}} lakes started {{to dry up}} about 10,000 years <b>ago</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> alpine glaciers that fed the rivers that filled the lakes {{disappeared}} and the region became increasingly arid. Fish that had migrated into the lake system from the Colorado River started to die off; the only survivors are the minnow-sized Death Valley pupfish and related species that adapted to living in springs. Ancient weak shorelines called strandlines from Lake Manly can easily be seen on a former island in the lake called Shoreline Butte.|$|E
5|$|Like other reptiles, dinosaurs are {{primarily}} uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous wastes from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia via the ureters into the intestine. In most living species, uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, {{at least some}} modern birds (such as hummingbirds) can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, {{as well as the}} output of the intestines, emerges from the cloaca. In addition, many species regurgitate pellets, and fossil pellets that may have come from dinosaurs are known from as long <b>ago</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Cretaceous period.|$|E

25|$|The geology of the Pacific Northwest is vast, {{complex and}} confusing.
