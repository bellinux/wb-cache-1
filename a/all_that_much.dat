It had its own objectives within the larger French strategy, and French planning had long considered the possibility of operations in Dutch territory. The coastal regions of Zealand and Holland were difficult to negotiate because of their many waterways. However, both the French and the Germans saw {{the possibility of a}} surprise flanking attack in this region. For the Germans this would have the advantage of bypassing the Antwerp-Namur line. The Zealand Isles were considered to be strategically critical, as they are just opposite the Thames estuary, so their capture would pose a special menace to the safety of England.|$|E

25|$|No firm {{conclusions}} can be drawn, however, whether {{long-term use}} of quazepam does not produce tolerance as few, if any, long-term clinical trials extending beyond 4 weeks of chronic use have been conducted. Quazepam should be withdrawn gradually if used beyond 4 weeks of use to avoid {{the risk of a}} severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome developing. Very high dosage administration over prolonged periods of time, up to 52 weeks, of quazepam in animal studies provoked severe withdrawal symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation, including excitability, hyperactivity, convulsions and the death of two of the monkeys due to withdrawal-related convulsions. More monkeys died however, in the diazepam-treated monkeys. In addition it has now been documented in the medical literature that one of the major metabolites of quazepam, N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam (N-desalkylflurazepam), which is long-acting and prone to accumulation, binds unselectively to benzodiazepine receptors, thus quazepam may not differ <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> pharmacologically from other benzodiazepines.|$|E

In the final cut of the film, however, most of the music was chosen by Sollett, editor Myron Kerstein and music supervisor Linda Cohen.

[...] The move to more intimate subject matter was [...] "semi-conscious" [...] because the band members did not want to focus on socio-political issues as they had in their previous works. Three tracks allude to Greek mythology: [...] "Ares" [...] draws its name from the god of war, [...] "Trojan Horse" [...] is named after the Trojan War military ruse, and [...] "Zephyrus" [...] draws its name from the god of the west wind. The narrative in the songs occurs between two people and focuses on the relations between lovers, friends, and enemies; Okereke indicated that [...] "it's about moments of shared vulnerability".

It seemed like when we were around, and actively playing and stuff, that people's responses to us were fairly ambivalent. I thought it was funny when the press picked up on it. For an independent release, it had a strange sort of audience and kept selling three or four years after we recorded it; it still sells more copies than when it first came out." [...] Touch and Go founder Corey Rusk said that Spiderland is [...] "like an icon now. But when it came out, nobody cared!

[...] Thomas Inskeep from Stylus Magazine also complimented the finale of the tour.

The Atlantics Spencer Kornhaber remarked, however, that the utter ruthlessness displayed by Underwoods in the season finale may have represented a [...] "jump the shark" [...] moment for the series: The Underwoods have murdered a politician and a journalist, and some innocents have also been collateral damage to their activities. Now, though, they've set out to maintain their power at the cost of mass casualties. Netflix hasn't said how many seasons are to come, but it's hard to imagine the show being watchable for <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> longer now that this rubicon of despicability has been crossed.Some compared Underwood's story line in season 4 to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Brian Moyland of The Guardian wrote: House of Cards has never felt like the real presidency: Frank Underwood is evil incarnate, bumping off junior Congressmen and pushing journalists in front of trains. But now that, in real life, we're in the throes of such a bizarre presidential race, his machinations are starting to look almost viable. There are several parallels between Underwood's re-election campaign and the 2016 campaigns of Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.|$|E

[...] Albini initially refused to give the album master tapes to Gold Mountain, but relented after a phone call from Novoselic. [...] The band decided against working with Wallace and chose to remix and augment the songs [...] "Heart-Shaped Box" [...] and [...] "All Apologies" [...] with Litt at Seattle's Bad Animals Studio in May 1993.
