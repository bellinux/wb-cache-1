2500|$|Some {{influential}} approaches {{within the}} sociology of law have challenged definitions of law in terms of official (state) law (see for example Eugen Ehrlich's concept of [...] "living law" [...] and Georges Gurvitch's [...] "social law"). From this standpoint, law is understood broadly to include not only the legal system and formal (or official) legal institutions and processes, but also various informal (or unofficial) forms of nomativity and regulation which are generated within groups, associations and communities. The sociological studies of law are, thus, not limited to analysing how the rules or institutions {{of the legal system}} interact with social class, gender, race, religion, sexuality and other social categories. They also focus on how the internal normative orderings of various groups and [...] "communities", such as the community of lawyers, businessmen, scientists, members of political parties, or members of the Mafia, interact with each other. In short, law is studied as an integral and constitutive part of social institutions, groupings and communities. This <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>developed</b> further under the section on legal pluralism.|$|E

5000|$|Thompson’s {{theological}} approach emphasizes communicating the Christian gospel inductively and narratively through storytelling. This {{approach is}} visible both in his preaching {{and in his}} published work. Thompson's technique combines the presentation of biblical stories or doctrines with stories of common life to illuminate key themes of the gospel in a way intended to be accessible to Christian audiences. It {{is a way of}} communicating theology practically that has been described as “combining stories from Scripture and stories from everyday life”. Thompson's <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>developed</b> most fully in Elements of Grace, where he couches his characteristically narrative style in meditations that are organized thematically into the [...] "elemental" [...] categories of Earth, Water, Spirit, Light, Darkness, Discipleship, and Word.|$|E

50|$|Another {{direction}} of inductive inference {{is based on}} E. Mark Gold's model of learning in the limit from 1967 and has developed since then more and more models of learning. The general scenario is the following: Given a class S of computable functions, is there a learner (that is, recursive functional) which for any input of the form (f(0),f(1),...,f(n)) outputs a hypothesis (an index e {{with respect to a}} previously agreed on acceptable numbering of all computable functions; the indexed function should be consistent with the given values of f). A learner M learns a function f if almost all its hypotheses are the same index e, which generates the function f; M learns S if M learns every f in S. Basic results are that all recursively enumerable classes of functions are learnable while the class REC of all computable functions is not learnable. Many related models have been considered and also the learning of classes of recursively enumerable sets from positive data is a topic studied from Gold's pioneering paper in 1967 onwards. A far reaching extension of the Gold’s <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>developed</b> by Schmidhuber's theory of generalized Kolmogorov complexities, which are kinds of super-recursive algorithms.|$|E
