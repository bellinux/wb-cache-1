In particular, for Cases I and IV, we can predict that the optimal control u^*∈ C^∞(Ω) as if the given data are sufficiently smooth. Indeed, from (2.22) and (2.25) we can observe that the regularity of the optimal control u^* agrees with that of the adjoint state z^*.|$|E
40|$|Sensitivity and {{uncertainty}} {{methods have been}} developed to aid in the establishment of areas of applicability and validation of computer codes and nuclear data for nuclear criticality safety studies. A key component in this work is the generation of sensitivity {{and uncertainty}} parameters for typically several hundred benchmarks experiments used in validation exercises. Previously, only one-dimensional sensitivity tools were available for this task, which necessitated the remodeling of multidimensional inputs in order for such an analysis to be performed. This paper describes the development of the SEN 3 Monte Carlo based sensitivity analysis sequence for SCALE. Two options in the SEN 3 package for the reconstruction of angular-dependent forward and <b>adjoint</b> <b>fluxes</b> are described and contrasted. These options are the direct calculation of flux moments versus the calculation of angular fluxes, with subsequent conversion to flux moments prior to sensitivity coefficient generation.

The neutron source was positioned in the diametral channel in the core and in the reflector. Small cylinders of 93 % enriched uranium metal and of copper were used, in the core and reflector regions respectively, to fill up the channels so as to avoid any flux perturbation around the source.

40|$|The {{calculation}} of the effective delayed neutron fraction, beff, with Monte Carlo codes is a complex task due to the requirement of properly considering the adjoint weighting of delayed neutrons. Nevertheless, several techniques have been proposed to circumvent this difficulty and obtain accurate Monte Carlo results for beff without the need of explicitly determining the <b>adjoint</b> <b>flux.</b> In this paper, we make a review {{of some of these}} techniques; namely we have analyzed two variants of what we call the k-eigenvalue technique and other techniques based on different interpretations of the physical meaning of the adjoint weighting. To test the validity of all these techniques we have implemented them with the MCNPX code and we have benchmarked them against a range of critical and subcritical systems for which either experimental or deterministic values of beff are available. Furthermore, several nuclear data libraries have been used in order {{to assess the impact of}} the uncertainty in nuclear data in the calculated value of beff...|$|E
40|$|Applicability of the first-order {{perturbation}} (FOP) theory {{method to}} reactivity estimation for source-driven systems is {{examined in this}} paper. First, the formally exact point kinetics equations have been derived from the space-dependent kinetics equations and the kinetics parameters including the dynamic reactivity have been defined. For the dynamic reactivity, exact and first-order perturbation theory expressions for the reactivity change have been formulated for source-driven systems. It has been also shown that the external source perturbation itself {{does not change the}} reactivity if the initial {lambda}-mode <b>adjoint</b> <b>flux</b> is used as the weight function. Using two source-driven benchmark problems, the reactivity change has been estimated with the FOP theory method for various perturbations. By comparing the resulting reactivity changes with the exact dynamic reactivity changes determined from the space-dependent kinetics solutions, {{it has been shown that}} the accuracy of the FOP theory method for the accelerator-driven system (ADS) is reasonably good and comparable to that for the critical reactors. The adiabatic assumption has also been shown to be a good approximation for the ADS kinetics analyses...|$|E
40|$|The neutron {{detection}} efficiency is a parameter {{required in the}} measurement of reactivity by the modified source technique. The direct solution of the {{detection efficiency}} at a perturbed state is costly. To solve for this, a particular variational functional, the Lewins' type variational functional, is presented. The functional is a ratio of two other functionals, each dealing with a reaction rate. The evaluation of this particular functional was done by treating the numerator and the denominator functionals separately. This leads to three flux equations, one for forward flux, and two for <b>adjoint</b> <b>fluxes.</b> The advantages of this formulation over, and the equivalence of this formulation to, the conventional functional presented in the literature are described in detail. The flexibility of the proposed functional is demonstrated by using it to estimate the detection efficiency with four different methods: variational interpolation, conventional variational, variational extrapolation, and multi- reference-state variational. Results are presented for one-dimensional and two- dimensional problems. All results are compared with direct calculations. In all cases, {{the results show that}} the variational interpolational method and the multi- reference-state variational method are efficient and practically acceptable...|$|R
40|$|The current {{knowledge}} of nuclear {{data in the}} fast neutron energy range {{is not as good}} as in the thermal range, resulting in larger propagated uncertainties in integral quantities such as critical masses or reactivity effects. This situation makes it difficult to get the full benefit from recent advances in modeling and simulation. Zero power facilities such as the French ZPR MINERVE have already demonstrated that they can contribute to significantly reduce those uncertainties thanks to dedicated experiments. Historically, MINERVE has been mainly dedicated to thermal spectrum studies. However, experiments involving fast-thermal coupled cores were also performed in MINERVE as part of the ERMINE program, in order to improve nuclear data in fast spectra for the two French SFRs: PHENIX and SUPERPHENIX. Some of those experiments have been recently revisited. In particular, a full characterization of ZONA- 1 and ZONA- 3, two different cores loaded in the ERMINE V campaign, has been done, with much attention paid to possible sources of errors. It includes detailed geometric descriptions, energy profiles of the direct and <b>adjoint</b> <b>fluxes</b> and spectral indices obtained thanks to Monte Carlo calculations and compared to a reference fast core configuration. Sample oscillation experiments of separated fission products such as 103 Rh or 99 Tc, which were part of the ERMINE V program, have been simulated using recently-developed options in the TRIPOLI- 4 code and compared to the experimental values. The present paper describes the corresponding results. The findings motivate in-depth studies for designing optimized coupled-core conditions in ZEPHYR, a new ZPR which will replace MINERVE and will provide integral data {{to meet the needs of}} Gen-III and Gen-IV reactors...|$|R

40|$|The SAMS module {{has been}} {{developed}} to calculate the relative change {{in the value of}} keff due to a change in a constituent component or cross section. The SAMS module works in conjunction with {{a modified version of the}} CSAS 25 sequence of SCALE that employs an enhanced version of KENO V. a, which is capable of calculating the spherical harmonics components of the flux moments. The SAMS module performs sensitivity calculations using linear perturbation theory as implemented in the FORSS system and requires the calculation of the forward and <b>adjoint</b> <b>flux</b> moments with the enhanced version of KENO V. a. SAMS automatically selects all of the sensitivity parameters that can be calculated for each nuclide in each region of the system based on available cross-section data. Sensitivity parameters for a given nuclide may be generated for a number of parameters, including total, scatter, capture, and fission cross sections, as well as n and c. The sensitivities for any nuclide-reaction pair calculated with SAMS can be output on three bases: group-wise region dependent, energy-integrated region dependent, and energy- and region-integrated. The sensitivities generated with SAMS have been verified through comparisons with thos...|$|E
40|$|The adjoint {{equation}} {{was introduced}} {{in the early days of}} neutron transport and its solution, the neutron importance, has been used for several applications in neutronics. The work presents at first a critical review of the adjoint neutron transport equation. Afterwards, the adjont model is constructed for a reference physical situation, for which an analytical approach is viable, i. e. an infinite homogeneous scattering medium. This problem leads to an equation that is the adjoint of the slowing-down equation, which is well known in nuclear reactor physics. A general closed-form analytical solution to such adjoint equation is obtained by a procedure that can be used also to derive the classical Placzek functions. This solution constitutes a benchmark for any statistical or numerical approach to the adjoint equation. A sampling technique to evaluate the <b>adjoint</b> <b>flux</b> for the transport equation is then proposed and physically interpreted as a transport model for pseudo-particles. This can be done by introducing appropriate kernels describing the transfer of the pseudo-particles in the phase space. This technique allows estimating the importance function by a standard Monte Carlo approach. The sampling scheme is validated by comparison with the analytical results previously obtaine...|$|E
40|$|The {{studies on}} Accelerator-Driven Systems (ADSs) have renewed the {{interest}} in the theoretical and computational evaluation of the main integral parameters characterizing subcritical systems (e. g., reactivity, effective delayed neutron fraction βeff, and mean prompt neutron generation time). In particular, some kinetic parameters, as the effective delayed neutron fraction, are evaluated in Monte Carlo codes by formulations which do not require the calculation of the <b>adjoint</b> <b>flux.</b> This paper is focused on a theoretical and computational analysis about how the different βeff definitions are connected and which are the approximations inherent to the Monte Carlo definition {{with respect to the}} standard definition involving weighted integrals. By means of a refined transport computational analysis carried out in a coherent and consistent way, that is, using the same deterministic code and neutron data library for the βeff evaluation in different ways, the theoretical analysis is numerically confirmed. Both theoretical and numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the Monte Carlo βeff evaluation, at least in cases where spectral differences between total and prompt fluxes are negligible with respect to the value of the functionals entering the classical βeff formulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of modeling a pressurized-water-reactor (PWR) facility and calculating dose rates at all locations within the containment and adjoining structures using MCNP 5 with mesh tallies is presented. Calculations of dose rates resulting from neutron and photon sources from the reactor (operating {{and shut down}} for various periods) and the spent fuel pool, {{as well as for}} the photon source from the primary coolant loop, were all of interest. Identification of the PWR facility, development of the MCNP-based model and automation of the run process, calculation of the various sources, and development of methods for visually examining mesh tally files and extracting dose rates were all a significant part of the project. Advanced variance reduction, which was required because of the size of the model and the large amount of shielding, was performed via the CADIS/ADVANTG approach. This methodology uses an automatically generated three-dimensional discrete ordinates model to calculate <b>adjoint</b> <b>fluxes</b> from which MCNP weight windows and source bias parameters are generated. Investigative calculations were performed using a simple block model and a simplified full-scale model of the PWR containment, in which the adjoint source was placed in various regions. In general, it was shown that placement of the adjoint source on the periphery of the model provided adequate results for regions reasonably close to the source (e. g., within the containment structure for the reactor source). A modification to the CADIS/ADVANTG methodology was also studied in which a global adjoint source is weighted by the reciprocal of the dose response calculated by an earlier forward discrete ordinates calculation. This method showed improved results over those using the standard CADIS/ADVANTG approach, and its further investigation is recommended for future efforts...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} for {{generating}} variance reduction parameters for strongly anisotropic, deep-penetration radiation shielding studies is presented. This method generates an alternate {{form of the}} <b>adjoint</b> scalar <b>flux</b> quantity, ϕ^†_Ω, which is used by both CADIS and FW-CADIS to generate variance reduction parameters for local and global response functions, respectively. The new method, called CADIS-Ω, was implemented in the Denovo/ADVANTG software suite, and results are presented for a concrete labyrinth test problem. Results indicate that the flux generated by CADIS-Ω incorporates localized angular anisotropies in the flux effectively. CADIS-Ω outperformed CADIS in the test problem while obtaining accurate results. This initial work indicates that CADIS-Ω may be highly useful for shielding problems with strong angular anisotropies. A future test plan to fully characterize the new method is proposed, which should reveal more about the types of realistic problems for which the CADIS-Ω will be suited...|$|R
40|$|Recently, Morel and McGhee {{described}} an alternate second-order {{form of the}} transport equation called the self <b>adjoint</b> angular <b>flux</b> (SAAF) equation that has the angular flux as its unknown. The SAAF formulation has all {{the advantages of the}} traditional even- and odd-parity self-adjoint equations, with the added advantages that it yields the full angular flux when it is numerically solved, it is significantly easier to implement reflective and reflective-like boundary conditions, and in the appropriate form it can be solved in void regions. The SAAF equation has the disadvantage that the angular domain is the full unit sphere and, like the even- and odd- parity form, S{sub n} source iteration cannot be implemented using the standard sweeping algorithm. Also, problems arise in pure scattering media. Morel and McGhee demonstrated the efficacy of the SAAF formulation for neutral particle transport. Here we apply the SAAF formulation to coupled electron-photon transport problems using multigroup cross-sections from the CEPXS code and S{sub n} discretization...|$|R
40|$|Monte Carlo {{methods are}} used to compute fluxes or dose rates over large areas using mesh tallies. For {{problems}} that demand that the uncertainty in each mesh cell be less than some set maximum, computation time {{is controlled by the}} cell with the largest uncertainty. This issue becomes quite troublesome in deep-penetration problems, and advanced variance reduction techniques are required to obtain reasonable uncertainties over large areas. [1] Oak Ridge National Laboratory has developed a new sequence, MAVRIC, which will be available with the release of SCALE 6. In this sequence, a methodology called Consistent Adjoint-Driven Importance Sampling (CADIS) has been incorporated for effective variance reduction. The CADIS methodology was developed to quickly and automatically determine the biased source distribution, as well as all of the values for the weight windows over a rectangular mesh and a given energy group structure. [2 - 3] The method first determines the approximate adjoint particle flux, usually using a discrete ordinates code. The source for this calculation is the detector energy-group response for the process of interest (e. g., dose rate) at the location(s) of interest. The resulting <b>adjoint</b> <b>flux</b> at each location and energy is equated to the importance of particles and is combined with the source distribution to generate the biased source and weigh...|$|E
40|$|The {{spectrum}} of glueballs in 2 + 1 dimensions is calculated within an extended class of Isgur-Paton flux tube models and compared to lattice calculations of the low-lying SU(N ≥ 2) glueball mass spectrum. Our modifications {{of the model}} include a string curvature term and {{a new way of}} dealing with the short-distance cut-off. We find that the generic model is remarkably successful at reproducing the positive charge conjugation, C = +, sector of the spectrum. The only large (and robust) discrepancy involves the 0 −+ state, raising the interesting possibility that the lattice spin identification is mistaken and that this state is in fact 4 −+. Additionally, the Isgur-Paton model does not incorporate any mechanism for splitting C = − from C = + (in contrast to the case in 3 + 1 dimensions), while the ‘observed ’ spectrum does show a substantial splitting. We explore several modifications of the model in an attempt to incorporate this physics in a natural way. At the qualitative level we find that this constrains our choice to the picture in which the C = ± splitting is driven by mixing with new states built on closed loops of <b>adjoint</b> <b>flux.</b> However a detailed numerical comparison suggests that a model incorporating an additional direct mixing between loops of opposite orientatio...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a new and}} efficient scheme to determine the optimal neutron source position in a model near-equilibrium pressurized water reactor, {{which is based on}} the OPR 1000 Hanul Unit 3 Cycle 7 configuration. The proposed scheme particularly assigns importance of source positions according to the local <b>adjoint</b> <b>flux</b> distribution. In this research, detailed pin-by-pin reactor adjoint fluxes are determined by using the Monte Carlo KENO-VI code from solutions of the reactor homogeneous critical adjoint transport equations. The adjoint fluxes at each allowable source position are subsequently ranked to yield four candidate positions with the four highest adjoint fluxes. The study next simulates ex-core detector responses using the Monte Carlo MAVRIC code by assuming a neutron source is installed in one of the four candidate positions. The calculation is repeated for all positions. These detector responses are later converted into an inverse count rate ratio curve for each candidate source position. The study confirms that the optimal source position is the one with very high adjoint fluxes and detector responses, which is interestingly the original source position in the OPR 1000 core, as it yields an inverse count rate ratio curve closest to the traditional 1 /M line. The current work also clearly demonstrates that the proposed adjoint flux-based approach can be used to efficiently determine the optimal geometry for a neutron source and a detector in a modern pressurized water reactor core...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{involves the}} development of a three-dimensional nodal code that calculates the Fourier transformed regular or <b>adjoint</b> neutron <b>flux</b> for a nuclear reactor. This numerical technique can be used in the nuclear reactor noise analysis field for identifying and locating vibrating reactor core components;The mathematical equations were developed and two types of solutions were obtained. The first solution was a modification of a three-dimensional nodal model developed to handle multigroup neutron diffusion equations. In this model, the Fourier transformed fluxes were expanded in the Legendre polynomial form. The second is an analytical procedure developed for a simple geometry and material composition. In the analytical model, the frequency-dependent flux was expanded in the eigenfunctions of the Helmholtz equation which yielded a series form solution. This solution was used to verify the validity of the nodal numerical technique;The nodal computer code was tested for 8, 64, and 216 node problems. Moreover, it was examined for frequencies inside and outside the plateau region of the zero power reactor transfer function. Frequencies considered were. 05, 10, 200 and 1000 rad/s where the plateau region extends from 0. 1 to 527 rad/s. The comparison between the results obtained showed that the nodal computer code can be used to calculate the frequency-dependent fluxes provided the reactor core is simulated by a large number of nodes and that the source is reduced in size so that it can represent point perturbations...|$|R
40|$|Spatial channel theory, {{initially}} {{introduced in}} 1977 by M. L. Williams {{and colleagues at}} ORNL, is {{a powerful tool for}} shield design optimization. It focuses on so called ''contributon'' flux and current of particles (a fraction of the total of neutrons, photons, etc.) which contribute directly or through their progeny to a pre-specified response, such as a detector reading, dose rate, reaction rate, etc., at certain locations of interest. Particles that do not contribute directly or indirectly to the pre-specified response, such as particles that are absorbed or leak out, are ignored. Contributon fluxes and currents are computed based on combined forward and adjoint transport solutions. The initial concepts were considerably improved by Abu-Shumays, Selva, and Shure by introducing steam functions and response flow functions. Plots of such functions provide both qualitative and quantitative information on dominant particle flow paths and identify locations within a shield configuration that are important in contributing to the response of interest. Previous work was restricted to two dimensional (2 -D) x-y rectangular and r-z cylindrical geometries. This paper generalizes previous work to three-dimensional x-y-z geometry, since it is now practical to solve realistic 3 -D problems with multidimensional transport programs. As in previous work, new analytic expressions are provided for folding spherical harmonics representations of forward and <b>adjoint</b> transport <b>flux</b> solutions.
