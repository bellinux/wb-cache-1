5|$|HSP occurs {{more often}} in {{children}} than in adults, and usually follows an upper respiratory tract infection. Half of <b>affected</b> <b>patients</b> are below the age of six, and 90% are under ten. It occurs about twice as often in boys as in girls. The incidence of HSP in children is about 20 per 100,000 children per year, making it the most common vasculitis in children.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis and {{treatment}} cost patients money, and the player can change hospital policy, including {{the amount of}} diagnosis patients require. This can be set to over 100 per cent to force patients to have further unnecessary diagnoses. Other policies include when staff can go on breaks and whether they can leave rooms, and loans can be taken out. From time to time, events such as emergencies (in which patients arrive and must be cured within a time limit or they will die), and epidemics (in which a disease spreads rapidly) occur. During the latter, the player can attempt {{to cover it up}} by curing all <b>affected</b> <b>patients</b> before a health inspector turns up. If the player fails, he or she is fined and must face a damaged reputation, a statistic that shows how well the hospital is doing and affects the flow of patients. VIPs may also occasionally ask to tour the hospital; if impressed, the player is granted a cash bonus, a reputation increase, or both. There is an advisor who keeps the player informed about what is going on. Rats may infest the hospital, and the player is able to shoot them with the cursor.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} on four sibling pairs affected by cystic fibrosis. Of each sibling pair, one was more affected than the other. The {{results show that the}} lymphoblastic response to the antigen Pseudomonas aeruginosa of the most <b>affected</b> <b>patient</b> was strongly reduced in comparison to the response of the less affected one. The plasma from the most <b>affected</b> <b>patient</b> contains an inhibitory factor which reduces the lymphoblastic response of the less affected one. On the other hand, plasma fom the less <b>affected</b> <b>patient</b> improves the lymphoblastic response of the most affected one (although not significantly). One notes a better lymphoblastic response when the most <b>affected</b> <b>patient's</b> lymphocytes are put {{in the presence of the}} less affected one's antigens and plasma. These findings suggest a phenomenon of lymphocyte tolerance in the most <b>affected</b> <b>patient</b> towards P. aeruginosa. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction Aspergillus spp. infections mainly <b>affect</b> <b>patients</b> who are immunocompromised, and are {{extremely}} rare in immunocompetent individuals. Case presentation Aspergillus post-operative mediastinitis {{is considered to}} be a devastating infection, usually <b>affecting</b> <b>patients</b> undergoing cardiothoracic surgery with specific predisposing factors. We describe the case of an immunocompetent 68 -year-old Caucasian man with severe chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, who underwent pulmonary thromboendarterectomy and developed post-operative mediastinitis due to Aspergillus flavus. The environmental control did not reveal the source of A. flavus infection and, despite combined antifungal therapy, our patient died as a result of septic shock and multiple organ failure. Conclusion Aspergillus mediastinitis mainly <b>affects</b> <b>patients</b> after cardiosurgery operations with predisposing factors, and it is unusual in patients who are immunocompetent. The identification of the Aspergillus spp. source is often difficult, and there are no guidelines for the administration of pre-emptive therapy in this population of at-risk patients. </p...|$|R

25|$|Sensory aphasia {{cannot be}} {{diagnosed}} {{through the use}} of imaging techniques. Differences in cognition between asymptomatic subjects and <b>affected</b> <b>patients</b> can be observed via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, these results only reveal temporal differences in cognition between control and diagnosed subjects. The degree of progression during therapy can also be surveyed through cognition tests monitored by fMRI. Many patients’ progress is assessed over time via repeated testing and corresponding cerebral imaging by fMRI.|$|E
25|$|Ependymomas are tumors {{arising from}} the ependyma, an epithelium-like tissue of the central nervous system. In {{patients}} with NF2 and ependymomas, the tumor suppressant function of Merlin may be compromised. Loss of function mutations occurring in chromosome 22q, where Merlin proteins are coded, can promote tumorigenesis, or {{the creation of new}} tumorous cells. Deletions, too, in the NH2-terminal domain of merlin proteins have been associated with early tumor onset and poor prognosis in <b>affected</b> <b>patients.</b>|$|E
25|$|Surgical, chemical, or {{radiofrequency}} sympathectomy — {{interruption of}} the affected portion of the sympathetic nervous system — {{can be used as}} a last resort in patients with impending tissue loss, edema, recurrent infection, or ischemic necrosis. However, there is little evidence that these permanent interventions alter the pain symptoms of the <b>affected</b> <b>patients,</b> and in addition to the normal risks of surgery, such as bleeding and infection, sympathectomy has several specific risks, such as adverse changes in how nerves function.|$|E

25|$|His careful {{analysis}} of the urine of the two affected siblings led him to request many physicians near Oslo to test the urine of other <b>affected</b> <b>patients.</b> This led {{to the discovery of}} the same substance he had found in eight other patients.

Further testing showed the melting point to be the same as phenylpyruvic acid, which indicated that the substance was in the urine.|$|E

The second man, Bilal Abdullah, was initially held at nearby Govan police station, one of the UK's high security police stations with the capability to hold terrorist suspects.

40|$|Background: The {{provision}} of foods in hospitals often becomes a public concern, particularly {{in relation to}} patient satisfaction. This {{may be due to}} not only the psychological effect of sick ill people but also because foods as output of food provision does not often give satisfaction to the patient. Objective: To find out the effect of rice diet selective menu to satisfaction of VIP inpatients at local hospital of the Province of Sulawesi Tenggara. Method: A cross sectional study was conducted. Population of the study were VIP inpatiens; samples were patients that fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria in September-December 2008. Samples were purposively taken. Data analysis used bivariate with chi square and multivariate with logistic regression test. Result: Out of 49 patients that got selected menu and standard menu in aspect of food appearance as many as 45 (91. 8 %) were satisfied in selected menu and 31 (63. 3 %) were satisfied in standard menu; in aspect of food taste 44 (89. 8 %) were satisfied in selected menu and 23 (46. 9 %) were satisfied in standard menu; in aspect of food serving 47 (95. 9 %) were satisfied in selected menu and 40 (81. 6 %) were satisfied in standard menu. Conclusion: In aspect of appearance, color, shape and portion of foods significantly <b>affected</b> <b>patient</b> satisfaction whereas texture did not <b>affect</b> <b>patient</b> satisfaction. In aspect of taste, all variables <b>affected</b> <b>patient</b> satisfaction. In aspect of food serving all variables did not <b>affect</b> <b>patient</b> satisfaction...|$|R
