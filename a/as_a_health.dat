5|$|As with {{previous}} Sonic games, Sonic 3 uses rings, {{scattered throughout the}} levels, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>health</b> system; when the player is attacked without rings, is crushed, falls off-screen, drowns, or exceeds the act's ten-minute limit, they lose a life {{and return to the}} most recently passed checkpoint. Dying with zero lives gives the player a game over. The levels also include power-ups in television monitors that, when hit, grant the character an extra life, temporary invincibility to most hazards, a number of rings, a shield that allows them to breathe underwater, a shield that allows them to withstand fire from enemy projectiles, or a shield that attracts nearby rings.|$|E
40|$|Last spring I {{was between}} {{opportunities}} when I was offered <b>a</b> position <b>as</b> <b>a</b> home <b>health</b> nurse. The offer entailed {{beginning in the}} position <b>as</b> <b>a</b> home <b>health</b> registered nurse (RN) case manager {{with the expectation that}} I would then utilize the knowledge gained <b>as</b> <b>a</b> home <b>health</b> nurse to create and improve existing educational courses for the agency’s nurses. I was intrigued with this possibility and so in April 2009 I bought new scrubs for my adventure <b>as</b> <b>a</b> home <b>health</b> nurse. Pleasantly, in June I was reassigned to hospice as that unit was short-staffed. When I was reassigned in October back to home health nursing, I began examining the cocreation of my experiences <b>as</b> <b>a</b> home <b>health</b> nurse and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> hospice nurse. My nursing practice, since graduating from nursing school in 1981, has been based upon the assumption that all persons are to be honored. Happily, I found a nursing theory that reso...|$|R

5|$|Before it {{was founded}} in 1810 by Lewis Tregonwell, the area was a deserted {{heathland}} occasionally visited by fishermen and smugglers. Initially marketed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>health</b> resort, the town received a boost when it appeared in Augustus Granville's 1841 book, The Spas of England. Bournemouth's growth truly accelerated {{with the arrival of the}} railway and it became a recognised town in 1870. Historically part of Hampshire, it joined Dorset with the reorganisation of local government in 1974. Since 1997, the town has been administered by a unitary authority, meaning it is independent of Dorset County Council, although it remains part of that ceremonial county. The local council is Bournemouth Borough Council.|$|E

5|$|Anticipating {{that people}} {{would come to the}} area to indulge in the newly fashionable pastime of sea-bathing, an {{activity}} with perceived health benefits, Tregonwell built a series of villas on his land between 1816 and 1822, which he hoped to let out. The common belief that pine-scented air was good for lung conditions, and in particular tuberculosis, prompted Tregonwell and Tapps to plant hundreds of pine trees. These early attempts to promote the town <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>health</b> resort meant that by the time Tregonwell had died in 1832, Bournemouth had grown into a small community with a scattering of houses, villas and cottages. The town would ultimately grow up around the scattered pines and tree-lined walk to the beach, later to become known as the Invalids' Walk.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Ages, Ampezzo {{fell under}} the {{jurisdiction}} of the Patriarchate of Aquileia, and of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1420, the village was conquered by the Republic of Venice. In 1508 it was conquered by Habsburgs, and by 1511 people of Ampezzo swore loyalty to the Emperor Maximilian, and that area was subsequently adjoined to the region of Pusterthal. In 1797, when the Treaty of Campo Formio was signed, Napoleon initially permitted Habsburg Empire to retain it, but in 1810 he added Ampezzo to the Department of Piave, following an attack on the town in which it was burned by the French. It was short-lived; Austrian Empire reclaimed it in 1813, and it remained in its possession even after the battles of Custoza and Sadowa in 1866 when Venice was ceded to Italy. The town gained a reputation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>health</b> resort; it was reportedly free of diseases such as cholera.|$|E
