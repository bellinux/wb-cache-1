30|$|Here, we {{introduce}} {{concepts of}} the uncertain inference and uncertain system. Inference rules are the key points of the inference systems. In fuzzy systems, CRI approach [22], Mamdani inference rules [23] and Takagi-Sugeno inference rules [24] {{are the most common}} used inference rules. Fuzzy if-then inference rules use fuzzy sets to describe the antecedents <b>and</b> the <b>consequents.</b> Unlike fuzzy inference, both antecedents <b>and</b> <b>consequents</b> in uncertain inference are characterized by uncertain sets. Uncertain inference [16] is a process of deriving consequences from human knowledge via uncertain set theory. First, we introduce the following inference rule.|$|R

5|$|DDT {{pollution}} in the environment was {{a major cause of}} decline of brown pelican populations in North America in the 1950s and 1960s. It entered the oceanic food web, contaminating and accumulating in several species, including one of the pelican’s primary food fish – the northern anchovy. Its metabolite DDE is a reproductive toxicant in pelicans and many other birds, causing eggshell thinning and weakening, <b>and</b> <b>consequent</b> breeding failure through the eggs being accidentally crushed by brooding birds. Since an effective ban on the use of DDT was implemented in the US in 1972, the eggshells of breeding brown pelicans there have thickened and their populations have largely recovered.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{argues for}} a modal {{explanation}} for temporal orientation facts in both antecedents <b>and</b> <b>consequents</b> of conditionals.

Thus, eventuality type and temporal orientation turn out to be correlated more closely than previously thought, and the 'present eventive constraint' is not useful in accounting for the temporal orientation facts. Thus we must look for a new kind of explanation. I argue that temporal orientation, and therefore also eventuality type, are correlated with modal flavor, so that the most promising way to explain the temporal orientation facts will be through appealing to the modal facts. Two apparent objections to this kind of account are removed: the proposed existence of epistemic eventives (I argue that these examples are actually derived statives), and the assumption that antecedents <b>and</b> <b>consequents</b> share the same modal flavor (they do not, despite traditional assumptions) ...|$|R

Results: the most cited antecedents were the presence of doubts and the need to define a care plan. Family reunion and working instrument were evidenced as attributes. With respect to consequents, to promote the effective communication and to establish a plan of consensual action were the most remarkable elements. Final considerations: the scarcity of publications on the subject was observed, as well as and the limitation of the empirical studies to the space of intensive therapy. Thus, by analyzing the attributes, antecedents <b>and</b> <b>consequents</b> of the concept it was possible to follow their evolution and to show their efficacy and effectiveness as a therapeutic intervention...|$|R

It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population <b>and</b> <b>consequent</b> pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places from the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze and, as a result, trading patterns shifted. The old elites lost their economic and social status and power passed into the hands of a new group of people.|$|E
5|$|Iron mining {{occurred}} in several locations, including the main English centre in the Forest of Dean, {{as well as}} in Durham and the Weald. Some iron to meet English demand was also imported from the continent, especially by the late 13th century. By the end of the 12th century, the older method of acquiring iron ore through strip mining was being supplemented by more advanced techniques, including tunnels, trenches and bell-pits. Iron ore was usually locally processed at a bloomery, and by the 14th century the first water-powered iron forge in England was built at Chingley. As a result of the diminishing woodlands <b>and</b> <b>consequent</b> increases in the cost of both wood and charcoal, demand for coal increased in the 12th century and it began to be commercially produced from bell-pits and strip mining.|$|E

Isolated populations survived on St. Paul Island until 5,600 years ago and Wrangel Island until 4,000 years ago.
