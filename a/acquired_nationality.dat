50|$|Colombians who <b>acquired</b> Colombian <b>nationality</b> {{by birth}} cannot be {{deprived}} of it under any circumstances, so <b>acquiring</b> another <b>nationality</b> does not in itself result {{in the loss of}} Colombian nationality.

50|$|A {{system for}} <b>acquiring</b> <b>nationality</b> by birth after birth is also available. If an {{unmarried}} Japanese father and non-Japanese mother have a child, the parents later marry, and the Japanese father acknowledges paternity, {{the child can}} <b>acquire</b> Japanese <b>nationality,</b> {{so long as the}} child has not reached the age of 20. Japanese nationality law effective from 1985 has been that if the parents are not married at the time of birth and the father has not acknowledged paternity while the child was still in the womb, the child will not <b>acquire</b> Japanese <b>nationality.</b> However, Japan's Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that denying nationality to children born out of wedlock to foreign mothers is unconstitutional.|$|R

40|$|Legal {{criteria}} for <b>acquiring</b> <b>nationality</b> are crucial in {{the integration of}} persons into society, since they provide access {{to the right to}} vote. Until now, the criteria most frequently used are those of ius soli (birth) and ius sanguinis (nationality is inherited from the parents), which comply with previous anthropological approaches and which jurists accept without reflection, or consider to be unshakeable traditions. The author’s proposal in this article is to accept that some of these legal criteria should be reformed, though not in an anarchic manner. On one hand, some of the ethnic criteria may be respected, but on the other, the processes of <b>acquiring</b> <b>nationality</b> should be streamlined by accepting the desire of persons wanting to change their nationality on moving to a new country of residence. Meanwhile, we must establish channels of demand for accepting the democratic values and legal system of the welcoming country, as a result of which it would be fair to call for a prior learning period before the rights to nationality and suffrage are granted. The author also adds – and accepts as being a fundamental element – some of Habermas’ inclusion theses, though she stresses that this discourse should be organised into two specific, feasible legal solutions or rather, in a realistic manner...|$|R
