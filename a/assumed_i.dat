500|$|My lads, {{you must}} all have {{observed}} the great {{increase in the}} enemy's force, and the threatening posture they have <b>assumed.</b> <b>I</b> {{have reason to believe}} they will attack us this night. I do not wish to conceal our real state, because I do not believe there is a man here who is afraid to face any sort of danger. We {{are in a position to}} defend ourselves against regular troops, far less a set of naked savages, with their spears and krisses. It is true they have swivels in their boats, but they cannot act here. I have not observed that they have any muskets, but if they have, so have we. When we were first thrown on shore we could only muster seventy-five musket ball cartridges [...] we now have sixteen hundred. They cannot send up, I believe, more than five hundred men; but with two hundred such as now stand around me, I do not fear a thousand [...] nor fifteen hundred of them. The pikemen standing firm, we will give them such a volley of musketry as they will be little prepared for; and when they are thrown into confusion, we will sally out, chase them into the water, and ten to one but we secure their vessels. let every man be on the alert, and should these barbarians this night attempt our hill, I trust we shall convince them they are dealing with Britons.|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} received media criticism {{due to her}} American accent {{upon her}} reintroduction in 2003. Johnson said, [...] "I knew that would happen because I'm the only character who speaks differently. I haven't taken any of that to heart." [...] However, when the accent was altered from American to British, this received criticism too with Ian Hyland from the Daily Mirror describing it as [...] "hilarious" [...] and branding the character [...] "Go Away Again Vicki". [...] He added, [...] "Presumably the producers decided the reason viewers found her so annoying was her whiny American voice. Try again, guys." [...] Upon her departure in 2004, Johnson was also critical about her character's alternating accent: [...] "When I took the job they weren't sure what accent they wanted Vicki to have and about a week before they told me it should be American. I did that {{for a few months}} and then one day out of the blue I arrived on set and they told me they wanted me to change to Cockney. It was the producer's decision. I was as stunned as everyone else - all the criticism was perfectly justified. It's probably the most stupid decision they could have made. People <b>assumed</b> <b>I</b> was slipping out of the accent - but it was nothing to do with me. I've taken a lot of stick. But it doesn't bother me because I know the truth." ...|$|E

We were in a great vast place full of wardrobes, with a remote glittering vista of brass bedsteads--skeleton beds, you know--and I tried to inspire him with some of the poetry of his emporium; tried to make him imagine these beds and things going east and west, north and south, to take sorrow, servitude, joy, worry, failing strength, restless ambition in their impartial embraces.
