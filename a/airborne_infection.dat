40|$|Background. In {{dental care}} institutions, {{patients}} {{as well as}} dentistry workers themselves {{are at risk of}} being exposed to various bacteria while on the other hand they both represent a source of such microorganisms. Apart from the infected patients and dental care personnel, modern apparatures used in dentistry along with inadequate and poorly maintained air conditioning appliances are the most significant agents of <b>airborne</b> and droplet <b>infection</b> spread. The paper presents recommendations on permitted degrees of airborne pollution in dental and health care institutions and reasons for the occurrence of <b>airborne</b> <b>infections.</b> In additon, the authors list the most frequent microorganisms spread by airborne and droplet pathways, and suggest protective measures that can effectively prevent exposure to infectious aerosols and droplets. Despite the plentiful evidence on the exposure of dental care workers and their patients to <b>airborne</b> <b>infections,</b> relatively scarce reports in the literature published so far have not allowed statistically significant conclusions on the morbidity due to <b>airborne</b> and droplet <b>infections</b> in dentistry. Conclusions. The paper calls attention to the importance of strict implementation of comprehensive hygienic measures that can prevent a great majority of <b>airborne</b> <b>infections.</b> However, this can only be achieved through a high professional motivation, permanent education in the field of nosocomial infection prevention and employment of hygienists in dentistry. </p...|$|R

Until recently, prion diseases were only thought to be transmissible via direct contact with infected tissue, such as from eating infected tissue, transfusion, or transplantation; new research now suggests that prion diseases can be transmitted via aerosols, but that the general public is not at risk of <b>airborne</b> <b>infection.</b>|$|E
50|$|Climate {{and living}} area. Rainfall (number of rainy days being more {{important}} than total precipitation), mean of sunshine daily hours, latitude, altitude are characteristic agents to take in account when assessing the possibility of spread of any <b>airborne</b> <b>infection.</b> Furthermore, some infrequent or exceptional extreme events also influence the dissemination of airborne diseases, as tropical storms, hurricanes, typhoons, or monsoons. Climate conditions determine temperature, winds and relative humidity in any territory, either all year around or at isolated moments (days or weeks). Those are the main factors affecting the spread, duration and infectiousness of droplets containing infectious particles. For instance, influenza virus, is spread easily in northern countries (north hemisphere), because of climate conditions which favour the infectiousness of the virus {{but on the other}} hand, in those countries, lots of bacterial infections cannot spread outdoor most of the year, keeping in a latent stage.|$|E

5000|$|According to scholars, Vox in Rama [...] "is {{the first}} {{official}} church document that condemns the black cat as an incarnation of Satan, and consequently it was the death warrant for the animal". It is also claimed that this worsened the Black Death a century after Gregory's time, because the plague was spread by rats which were unchecked in Europe due to the decline of cat numbers. The Black Death began in central Asia and spread west, devastating large swathes of central Asia, Asia Minor and the Middle East before hitting Europe.

50|$|Airborne {{precautions}} prevent {{transmission of}} infectious agents that remain infectious over long distances when {{suspended in the}} air (e.g., rubeola virus measles, varicella virus chickenpox, M. tuberculosis, and possibly SARS-CoV). The preferred placement for patients who require airborne precautions is in an <b>airborne</b> <b>infection</b> isolation room (AIIR). An AIIR is a single-patient room that is equipped with special air handling and ventilation capacity that meet the American Institute of Architects/Facility Guidelines Institute (AIA/FGI) standards for AIIRs (i.e., monitored negative pressure relative to the surrounding area, air exchanges per hour for new construction and renovation and 6 air exchanges per hour for existing facilities, air exhausted directly to the outside or recirculated through HEPA filtration before return). Some states require the availability of such rooms in hospitals, emergency departments, and nursing homes that care for patients with M. tuberculosis. A respiratory protection program that includes education about use of respirators, fit-testing, and user seal checks is required in any facility with AIIRs. In settings where airborne precautions cannot be implemented due to limited engineering resources (e.g., physician offices), masking the patient, placing the patient in a private room (e.g., office examination room) with the door closed, and providing N95 or higher level respirators or masks if respirators are not available for healthcare personnel will {{reduce the likelihood of}} airborne transmission until the patient is either transferred to a facility with an AIIR or returned to the home environment, as deemed medically appropriate. Healthcare personnel caring for patients on airborne precautions wear a mask or respirator, depending on the disease-specific recommendations (Appendix A), that is donned prior to room entry. Whenever possible, non-immune HCWs should not care for patients with vaccine-preventable airborne diseases (e.g., measles, chickenpox, and smallpox).|$|E
40|$|When {{infectious}} epidemics occur, {{they can}} be perpetuated within health care settings, potentially resulting in severe health care workforce absenteeism, morbidity, mortality, and economic losses. The ventilation system configuration of an <b>airborne</b> <b>infection</b> isolation room is one factor that {{can play a role}} in protecting health care workers from infectious patient bioaerosols. Though commonly associated with airborne infectious diseases, the <b>airborne</b> <b>infection</b> isolation room design can also impact other transmission routes such as short-range airborne as well as fomite and contact transmission routes that are impacted by contagion concentration and recirculation. This article presents a computational fluid dynamics study on the influence of the ventilation configuration on the possible flow path of bioaerosol dispersal behavior in a mock <b>airborne</b> <b>infection</b> isolation room. At first, a mock <b>airborne</b> <b>infection</b> isolation room was modeled that has the room geometry and layout, ventilation parameters, and pressurization corresponding to that of a traditional ceiling-mounted ventilation arrangement observed in existing hospitals. An alternate ventilation configuration was then modeled to retain the linear supply diffuser in the original mock <b>airborne</b> <b>infection</b> isolation room but interchanging the square supply and exhaust locations to place the exhaust closer to the patient source and allow clean air from supply vents to flow in clean-to-dirty flow paths, originating in uncontaminated parts of the room prior to entering the contaminated patient's air space. The modeled alternate <b>airborne</b> <b>infection</b> isolation room ventilation rate was 12 air changes per hour. Two human breathing models were used to simulate a source patient and a receiving health care worker. A patient cough cycle was introduced into the simulation, and the <b>airborne</b> <b>infection</b> dispersal was tracked in time using a multi-phase flow simulation approach. The results from the alternate configuration revealed that the cough aerosols were pulled by the exhaust vent without encountering the health care worker by 0. 93 s after patient coughs and the particles were controlled as the aerosols' flow path was uninterrupted by an air particle streamline from patient to the ceiling exhaust venting out cough aerosols. However, not all the aerosols were vented out of the room. The remaining cough aerosols entered the health care worker's breathing zone by 0. 98 s. This resulted in one of the critical stages in terms of the health care worker's exposure to airborne virus and presented the opportunity for the health care worker to suffer adverse health effects from the inhalation of cough aerosols. Within 2 s, the cough aerosols reentered and recirculated within the patient and health care worker's surroundings resulting in pockets of old contaminated air. By this time, coalescence losses decreased as the aerosol were no longer in very close proximity and their movement was primarily influenced by the <b>airborne</b> <b>infection</b> isolation room airflow patterns. In the patient and health care worker's area away from the supply, the fresh air supply failed to reach this part of the room to quickly dilute the cough aerosol concentration. The exhaust was also found to have minimal effect upon cough aerosol removal, except for those areas with high exhaust velocities, very close to the exhaust grill. Within 5 - 20 s after a patient's cough, the aerosols tended to break up to form smaller sized aerosols of less than one micron diameter. They remained airborne and entrained back into the supply air stream, spreading into the entire room. The suspended aerosols resulted in the floating time of more than 21 s in the room due to one cough cycle. The duration of airborne contagion in the room and its prolonged exposure to the health care worker is likely to happen due to successive coughing cycles. Hence, the evaluated alternate <b>airborne</b> <b>infection</b> isolation room is not effective in removing at least 38 % particles exposed to health care worker within the first second of a patient's cough.
