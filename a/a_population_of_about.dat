5|$|According to {{the hearth}} tax returns from 1664, the {{township}} of Altrincham had <b>a</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 636, {{making it the}} largest of the local settlements; this had increased to 1,692 in 1801. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, the town's population increase by 165per cent, higher than 89per cent across England and 98per cent in the Trafford area. The growth of the settlement was a result of the Industrial Revolution, and although Altrincham was one of the fastest growing townships in the Trafford area, but paled in comparison to new industrial areas such as Ashton-under-Lyne, Hyde, and Manchester. In the second half of the 19th century, Altrincham's population grew by 275per cent, higher than the 235per cent for Trafford and 69per cent nationally in the same period. This was due to the late industrialisation of the area and the introduction of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway in 1849. The table below details the population change since 1801, including the percentage change since the last census.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the hearth}} tax returns of 1664, the {{township}} of Sale had <b>a</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 365. Parish registers {{show that the}} area experienced steady population growth during the 17th and 18th centuries, more so during {{the latter half of}} the 19th century (due to the Industrial Revolution). This later growth was less rapid than that seen in neighbouring areas such as Altrincham, Bowdon or Stretford. The increase in growth in {{the latter half of the}} 19th century also coincides with the arrival of the railway, indicative of Sale's growth as a commuter town. A huge increase in population in 1921–1931 is accounted for by the administrative merger of Sale with Ashton upon Mersey in 1930. Steady growth thereon is evident until 1981, when the decline of industry in Trafford and the Greater Manchester area accounts for a reduction in the town's population. This follows the general population trend for Greater Manchester, with residents relocating to new jobs. The table below details population changes since 1801, including the percentage change since the last census.|$|E
