40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{standard}} Cusum charts {{with head}} start value zero are compared with fast initial response (FIR) Cusum charts proposed by Lucas and Crosier (1982) {{from the viewpoint}} of the false <b>alarm</b> probability <b>function.</b> The focus in this comparison is conserva-tiveness. The concept of conservativeness is based on the relationship between the in-control ARL and the false <b>alarm</b> probability <b>function</b> by regarding the Cusum statistic as a Markov process. The comparison shows that standard Cusum charts are conservative in contrast to FIR Cusum charts. Moreover, the concept of false <b>alarm</b> probability <b>function</b> provides an easy probabilistic interpretation of the in-control ARL. ...|$|R

5000|$|In 2016 Lego, {{as part of}} his Lego Mindstorms Remix Challenge, gave 48 {{hours to}} four company desginers {{to come up with a}} new item by {{combining}} two different existing products, the Lego Mindstorms EV3 (31313) and the Lego Technic Heavy Lift Helicopter (42052) sets. The winner model was a cuckoo and alarm clock by Jørn Kristian Thomsen. The cuckoo bird pops out to ‘cuckoo’ every 15 minutes and the <b>alarm</b> <b>function</b> triggers a moving, shooting vehicle to get you out of bed.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to radio, recent clock radios have other music {{sources such as}} iPod, iPhone, and/or audio CD. When the alarm is triggered, it can play a set radio station or the music from a selected music source to awaken the sleeper. These models usually come with a dock for iPod/iPhone that also charges the device while it is docked. They can play FM/AM radio, iPod/iPhone or CD like a typical music player as well (without being triggered by the <b>alarm</b> <b>function).</b> A few popular models offer [...] "nature sounds" [...] like rain, forest, fire, sea, waterfall etc., {{in place of the}} buzzer.|$|E
5000|$|An alarm clock/radio {{featuring}} a light function. The light is a green zig-zag shaped tube {{running across the}} top of the clock. The <b>alarm</b> <b>function</b> can be set to radio or one of the pre-set alarm noises. The noises always begin with a rocket blast-off noise as someone says [...] "3...2...1..." [...] The alarms available are a bugle call, a cuckoo clock sound, a spring bounce sound, the Nickelodeon Theme (Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, N-Nick, Nick, Nick, Nickelodeon!), or the radio. A second version of the clock featured 8 noises, adding on a marching band sound, train whistle, [...] "Wake up!" [...] repeated, and a Rooster Call. The clock display is green. It features one circular speaker on the left side of the clock. The radio antenna included is simply a flexible rubber-covered wire.

5000|$|Wireless {{ambulatory}} electrocardiography (ECG) {{is a type}} of ambulatory electrocardiography with {{recording devices}} that use wireless technology, such as Bluetooth and smartphones, for at-home cardiac monitoring (monitoring of heart rhythms). These devices are generally recommended to people who have been previously diagnosed with arrhythmias and want to have them monitored, or for those who have suspected arrhythmias and need to be monitored {{over an extended period of}} time in order to be diagnosed. [...] Wireless Ambulatory ECGs work in a way similar to a regular ECG by measuring the electrical potential of the heart through the skin. The data is saved on an application on a Smart Phone, and then uploaded to a computer through Bluetooth or Cloud technologies. The information can also be sent through these technologies or through email to a doctor or cardiac technician. [...] Wireless Ambulatory ECGs are able to provide voice alarm messages when cardiac abnormalities occur, such as bradycardia, and can record this information and provide a screen prompt for the patient to view the data. The devices can also store mass amounts of ECG data on the phone, replay the ECG readings at a high speed, and have a low voltage <b>alarm</b> <b>function</b> to not waste the battery life. These characteristics of the devices are seen as benefits in comparison to current ambulatory ECG monitoring equipment such as the Holter monitor.|$|E
30|$|The entire {{procedure}} {{is based on}} the Molchan diagram that evaluates retrospectively the performance of the input model with respect to the current model. For this reason, the input model must be expressed through an <b>alarm</b> <b>function</b> A in each of the considered magnitude ranges. For example, the <b>alarm</b> <b>function</b> of a rate-based model may be simply calculated as a sum of the rates over a magnitude range (Kossobokov 2006).|$|E
30|$|Molchan {{tests are}} used to compare an alarm-based model with a {{reference}} model of seismicity defined on the same spatial grid (Molchan 1990). For any space-time region (x,t), the reference model provides the rate λ(x,t) of target earthquakes. The alarm-based model is entirely defined by its <b>alarm</b> <b>function</b> A(x,t). Where this <b>alarm</b> <b>function</b> exceeds a given threshold value A 0, an alarm is issued and a target earthquake is expected to occur. Although it is not necessary, it is usually assumed that A values are ordered from smallest to largest according to the probability of occurrence of a target event. In almost all cases, numerical forecast models can be easily converted to an alarm-based forecast because the information provided by a numerical value assignment on a given space-time grid {{can be used as}} an <b>alarm</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: Our {{objective}} was to evaluate the accuracy and safety of a real-time (RT) continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) in patients before and after cardiothoracic surgery and to investigate whether activation of the <b>alarm</b> <b>function</b> of the RT-CGMS {{had an effect on}} glucose control. Methods: Patients scheduled for elective cardiothoracic procedures, without a history of insulin-requiring diabetes, were perioperatively monitored with RT-CGMS for 72 h and were randomized into two groups: with or without the <b>alarm</b> <b>function</b> (set at 4 and 10 mmol/L) of the device activated. Sensor values were compared with capillary, arterial, and venous blood glucose values. Percentages of time spent in various glucose ranges were compared between groups. Results: There were no adverse effects of the RT-CGMS. Of the 1, 001 sensor value comparisons with capillary or arterial measurements, 96. 6 % fell within Clarke Error Grid zones A and B, with relative absolute differences ranging from 15 % (preoperative period) to 12 % (intensive care unit period) to 14 % (postoperative period on the ward). Seventeen (7. 9 %) arterial and 16 (2. 0 %) capillary comparisons fell within zone D or E. Whether or not the <b>alarm</b> <b>function,</b> as used in this pilot study, was activated did not affect time spent in different glucose ranges. Conclusions: Although the RT-CGMS is safe and accurate according to accepted standards, there are still small aberrations, which in our opinion preclude unlimited use in its present form in a clinical setting. The effect of the <b>alarm</b> <b>function</b> at different glucose levels remains to be investigated...|$|E
30|$|At CSEP testing centers, all the rate-based {{models are}} {{evaluated}} by using likelihood tests. In contrast, alarm-based models are only tested at the California testing center using Molchan tests {{and the related}} ROC and ASS tests (Zechar and Jordan 2008; Zechar 2010). Unfortunately, alarm- and rate-based models are still tested independently. The main {{reason for this is}} that the likelihood tests cannot be applied to an alarm-based model with a nonprobabilistic <b>alarm</b> <b>function.</b> To address this problem, Shebalin et al. (2012) proposed a method to convert alarm-based models to rate-based forecasts. In addition, two rate-based models can be compared by using Molchan diagrams. In practice, the complete rate-based model should be reduced to a single rate value by summing over a given range of magnitude. The reduced model can be treated as a rate-based model and/or as an alarm-based model. Its <b>alarm</b> <b>function</b> is simply composed of the single rate value in each spatial cell.|$|E

40|$|For safe, {{efficient}} and environment-friendly navigation from port to port, enhanced computer- based systems are {{installed on the}} ships navigational bridges. By means of new rules and regulations of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) many of highly sophisticated technical systems were made mandatory over the last years. This is mainly to support the bridge team in detecting potential dangers and to manage the risks by appropriate control measures. Main types of maritime operational risks are: risk of collision, risk of grounding. As part of maritime safety management, specific dedicated decision-support systems, with implemented <b>alarm</b> <b>functions,</b> are integrated into the navigation systems of modern ships. However, with respect to collision avoidance, the <b>alarm</b> <b>functions</b> are still based on conventional algorithms. They are robust but often of little use, {{because the number of}} triggered warnings is sometimes higher than the workload capacity of a human operator. Often the system triggers an alarm for an encounter situation classified as dangerous whereas the human operator's assessment according to his mental model is e. g. 'not critical'. One reason therefore is that the algorithms are based on fixed static limit values and only few selected information are used although new systems provide a wider range of situation parameter. On the other hand, compared to collision avoidance systems used in aviation, onboard a ship a collision warning might be ignored or the alarm could even be switched off. Consequently, the accident rates are still at a high level. Within this paper, investigations into the situation regarding the use of collision warnings in maritime traffic are described. Results gained during field studies onboard will be presented and discussed. The development of a concept to automatically adapt alarm thresholds by using enhanced fast-time simulation techniques will be introduced. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group...|$|R
