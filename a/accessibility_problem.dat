50|$|One {{benefit of}} the Structural {{paradigm}} is that test generation can focus on testing {{a limited number of}} relatively simple circuit elements rather than having to deal with an exponentially exploding multiplicity of functional states and state transitions. While the task of testing a single logic gate at a time sounds simple, there is an obstacle to overcome. For today’s highly complex designs, most gates are deeply embedded whereas the test equipment is only connected to the primary Input/outputs (I/Os) and/or some physical test points. The embedded gates, hence, must be manipulated through intervening layers of logic. If the intervening logic contains state elements, then the issue of an exponentially exploding state space and state transition sequencing creates an unsolvable problem for test generation. To simplify test generation, DFT addresses the <b>accessibility</b> <b>problem</b> by removing the need for complicated state transition sequences when trying to control and/or observe what’s happening at some internal circuit element.Depending on the DFT choices made during circuit design/implementation, the generation of Structural tests for complex logic circuits can be more or less automated or self-automatedhttp://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~bengal/SCI_paper.pdf. One key objective of DFT methodologies, hence, is to allow designers to make trade-offs between the amount and type of DFT and the cost/benefit (time, effort, quality) of the test generation task.|$|E

To investigate general <b>accessibility</b> and perceived <b>problems</b> of <b>accessibility</b> {{to the public}} environment in a town centre, as well as visiting preferences to public facilities, among teenagers with functional limitations. METHODS: An interview questionnaire specific to a south Swedish town was constructed and used with 33 Swedish teenagers with functional limitations. RESULTS: To a varying degree, all 33 teenagers commented on <b>accessibility</b> <b>problems,</b> e. g. concerning uneven surface material outdoors, steps at entrances, heavy doors and restricted space indoors. The results also indicated that teenagers with functional limitations to a high extent want to visit the same environments as other teenagers, {{but that it is}} often impossible owing to <b>accessibility</b> <b>problems.</b> Furthermore, because of <b>accessibility</b> <b>problems,</b> many of the teenagers were dependent on personal assistance. CONCLUSION: Inaccessibility results in dependence, which might affect personal development negatively, and much effort are required in order to ensure activity and societal participation.

40|$|Abstract. Leftist grammars can be {{characterized}} in terms of rules of the form a → ba and cd → d, without distinction between terminals and nonterminals. They were introduced by Motwani et. al. [9], where the <b>accessibility</b> <b>problem</b> for some general protection system was related to these grammars. This protection system was originally proposed in [3, 10] {{in the context of}} Java virtual worlds. Here, the <b>accessibility</b> <b>problem</b> is formulated in the form “Can object p gain (illegal) access to object q by a series of legal moves (as prescribed by the policy) ?”. It was shown [9] that the membership problem for leftist grammar is decidable what implied the decidability of the <b>accessibility</b> <b>problem</b> for the appropriate protection system. We study relationships between language classes defined by various types of leftist grammars and classes of the Chomsky hierarchy. We show that general leftist grammars can recognize languages which are not context free, answering in negative the question from [9]. Moreover, we study some restricted variants of leftist grammars and relate them to regular, deterministic context free and context free languages. Topics: formal languages; <b>accessibility</b> <b>problem</b> in protection systems. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Housing {{environments that}} hinder {{performance}} of daily activities and impede participation in social life have negative health consequences {{particularly for the}} older segment of the population. From a public health perspective accessible housing that supports {{active and healthy ageing}} is therefore crucial. The objective {{of the present study was}} to make an inventory of environmental barriers and investigate <b>accessibility</b> <b>problems</b> in the ordinary housing stock in Sweden as related to the functional capacity of senior citizens. Particular attention was paid to differences between housing types and building periods and to identify environmental barriers generating the most <b>accessibility</b> <b>problems</b> for sub-groups of senior citizens. Methods Data on environmental barriers in dwellings from three databases on housing and health in old age was analysed (N[*]=[*] 1021). Four functional profiles representing large groups of senior citizens were used in analyses of the magnitude and severity of potential <b>accessibility</b> <b>problems.</b> Differences in terms of type of housing and building period were examined. Results High proportions of one-family houses as well as multi-dwellings had substantial numbers of environmental barriers, with significantly lower numbers in later building periods. <b>Accessibility</b> <b>problems</b> occurred already for senior citizens with few functional limitations, but more profound for those dependent on mobility devices. The most problematic housing sections were entrances in one-family houses and kitchens of multi-dwellings. Conclusions Despite a high housing standard in the Swedish ordinary housing stock the results show substantial <b>accessibility</b> <b>problems</b> for senior citizens with functional limitations.

METHOD: Utilizing data from 1, 542 persons aged 75 to 89 years and applying Configuration Frequency Analysis, we tested which combinations of functional limitations that occurred more or less often than expected.
