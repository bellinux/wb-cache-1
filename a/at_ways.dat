5|$|The tariff fight {{continued}} into the 50th Congress, which opened in 1887, in which Democrats retained control of the House, with a reduced majority. By that time, Cleveland had openly sided with the tariff reformers and backed the proposals introduced in 1888 by Representative Roger Q. Mills of Texas. Mills had replaced Morrison <b>at</b> <b>Ways</b> and Means after the latter's defeat for reelection, and was as {{much in favor of}} tariff reform as the Illinoisan had been. Mills's bill would make small cuts to tariffs on raw materials, but relatively deeper cuts to those on manufactured goods; Randall, representing a manufacturing district, opposed it immediately. Randall was again ill and absent from the House when the Mills tariff passed by a 162 to 149 vote. The Senate, now Republican-controlled, refused to consider the bill, and it died with the 50th Congress in 1889.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Allen became {{chairman}} of the MCC's Cricket Committee. The committee looked <b>at</b> <b>ways</b> to improve cricket, for example analysing whether reducing {{the size of the}} ball would help bowlers. Allen also began to pursue bowlers with illegal bowling actions; commentators were aware that this was a growing issue but no action had been taken, and Allen took the lead. Three English bowlers were no-balled for throwing in 1959 and another five in 1960. Geoff Griffin, a bowler who toured England with the South African team in 1960, was perceived to have a suspect action; when the bowler was no-balled for throwing in a Test match, the South African press suggested that Allen had played a prominent part. Later that year, Allen met Bradman, Australia's representative at the Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC); the pair wanted to ensure that bowling actions would be fair in future, and the ICC agreed to take action. When Australia toured England in 1961, no bowlers whose actions had been questioned were included in either team. Allen later took the lead in re-drafting the law on throwing.|$|E

Cape May City and West Cape May could see annual savings approaching a combined $6 million from the dissolution.|$|E

25|$|Current {{research}} is looking <b>at</b> <b>ways</b> to consider tumor marker proteomics {{in combination with}} other indicators of disease (i.e. radiology and/or symptoms) to improve diagnostic accuracy. The challenge in such an approach is that the disparate prevalence of ovarian cancer means that even testing with very high sensitivity and specificity will still lead to a number of false positive results, which in turn may lead to issues such as performing surgical procedures in which cancer is not found intraoperatively. Genomics approaches have not yet been developed for ovarian cancer.|$|E
25|$|Planning {{continued}} {{for the northern}} Dutchess stretch, to be built after the war. With the enforced break in construction, and its new authority over the entire road, the commission began to look <b>at</b> <b>ways</b> to improve what had already been built, {{especially in light of}} the road's growing role as a regional artery. The Hawthorne Circle, where the Taconic, Saw Mill River Parkway and NY100 intersected, was the major problem. It had become a magnet for accidents and congestion. A 1944 study recommended it be replaced with a three-level grade-separated interchange.|$|E

25|$|In the {{immediate}} post-war era the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was inundated with requests {{to set up}} new television stations. Worrying about congestion of {{the limited number of}} channels available, the FCC put a moratorium on all new licenses in 1948 while considering the problem. A solution was immediately forthcoming; rapid development of radio receiver electronics during the war had opened a wide band of higher frequencies to practical use, and the FCC set aside a large section of these new UHF bands for television broadcast. At the time, black and white television broadcasting was still in its infancy in the U.S., and the FCC started to look <b>at</b> <b>ways</b> of using this newly available bandwidth for color broadcasts. Since no existing television would be able to tune in these stations, they were free to pick an incompatible system and allow the older VHF channels to die off over time.|$|E
25|$|This type {{of therapy}} uses {{a blend of}} cognitive, {{behavioral}} and some humanistic training techniques to target the stressors of the client. This usually is used to help clients better cope with their stress or anxiety after stressful events. This is a three-phase process that trains the client to use skills that they already have to better adapt to their current stressors. The first phase is an interview phase that includes psychological testing, client self-monitoring, {{and a variety of}} reading materials. This allows the therapist to individually tailor the training process to the client. Clients learn how to categorize problems into emotion-focused or problem-focused, so that they can better treat their negative situations. This phase ultimately prepares the client to eventually confront and reflect upon their current reactions to stressors, before looking <b>at</b> <b>ways</b> to change their reactions and emotions in relation to their stressors. The focus is conceptualization.|$|E

500|$|From 2001 to 2007, the Nauru {{detention}} centre provided a {{significant source of}} income for the country. The Nauruan authorities reacted with concern to its closure by Australia. In February 2008, the Foreign Affairs minister, Dr Kieren Keke, stated that the closure would result in 100Nauruans losing their jobs, and would affect 10percent of the island's population directly or indirectly: [...] "We have got a huge number of families that are suddenly going to be without any income. We are looking <b>at</b> <b>ways</b> we can try and provide some welfare assistance but our capacity to do that is very limited. Literally we have got a major unemployment crisis in front of us."

500|$|The early 19th {{century has}} been seen as a time of decline for the society; of 662 fellows in 1830, only 104 had contributed to the Philosophical Transactions. The same year, Charles Babbage {{published}} [...] Reflections on the Decline of Science in England, and on Some of Its Causes, which was deeply critical of the Society. The scientific Fellows of the Society were spurred into action by this, and eventually James South established a Charters Committee [...] "with a view to obtaining a supplementary Charter from the Crown", aimed primarily at looking <b>at</b> <b>ways</b> to restrict membership. The Committee recommended that the election of Fellows take place on one day every year, that the Fellows be selected on consideration of their scientific achievements and that the number of fellows elected a year be limited to 15. This limit was increased to 17 in 1930 and 20 in 1937; it is currently 52. This had a number of effects on the Society: first, the Society's membership became almost entirely scientific, with few political Fellows or patrons. Second, the number of Fellows was significantly reduced—between 1700 and 1850, the number of Fellows rose from approximately 100 to approximately 750. From then until 1941, the total number of Fellows was always between 400 and 500.|$|E
500|$|Reception of {{the race}} was mainly negative. Italian {{newspaper}} Corriere dello Sport – Stadio called it [...] "boring", while fellow Italian paper Corriere della Sera wrote of [...] "Formula One like a sleeping pill". Sky Sports described the race as [...] "mundane" [...] and [...] "soporific". Spanish newspaper Sport highlighted Max Verstappen's [...] "spectacular" [...] overtaking as bringing [...] "the only colour" [...] into the race. The Independent wrote, referring to Hamilton's desperate attempts to pass Rosberg: [...] "If {{there was ever a}} race which confirmed that Formula One should be looking <b>at</b> <b>ways</b> to facilitate overtaking, this was it." [...] In the wake of his experience, Hamilton called for Formula One to adjust rules to enhance overtaking, saying: [...] "I guess for fans it's probably not too exciting to watch. Of course, it's always nice when you're at the front, as we have been for some time now - but still, being able to race is what... and also down the back, {{the rest of the field}} is probably what fans want to see. That's probably a change that would be looked positively on." [...] Sebastian Vettel agreed, calling for more grip created by the tyres to make it easier to follow a car closely.|$|E

500|$|The {{sound design}} team {{began working on}} the game early in development, {{in order to achieve}} the best results; they {{immediately}} realised that it would be challenging. Early in development, Druckmann told the sound team to [...] "make it subtle", and underplay ideas. Audio lead Phillip Kovats was excited to completely create all sounds; no sounds were carried across from previous games. The team looked <b>at</b> <b>ways</b> to create sounds from a naturalistic point-of-view, and how to introduce minimalism into a game. By doing so, they found that it added feelings of tension, loss and hope, and that the game appeared to be a typical [...] "action game" [...] without the minimalism approach. They used a high dynamic range, allowing them the opportunity to inform players on tactical information, and locations to explore. The game's sound design was created to reflect a more [...] "grounded" [...] and subtle mood than Uncharted, particularly focusing on the lack of sound. Taking inspiration from No Country for Old Men, the team attempted to [...] "do more with less"; Kovats said that the team was trying to tell a story by [...] "going for a reductive quality". Straley stated that the audio is vital to some scenes in the game; [...] "It's more about the psychology of what's happening on the audioscape than what you're seeing," [...] he stated. He felt that this decision allowed a more impactful and meaningful effect with sound occurred. The sound team also attempted to portray the game's dark themes through sound. The team felt {{that it was important to}} let sounds play for as long as possible in the game, drawing tension. The team used a propagation technique to help players determine the exact locations of enemies, using this as a tactical advantage. This system, created by the team at Naughty Dog, is processed at random in the game engine. For the game's audio, the engine throws out 1500–2500 ray casts per frame; though most games avoid this, the game's engine allowed it to work. The team spent a lot of time recording sounds for the game, namely doors, and rusty metal. Sound designer Neil Uchitel traveled to Rio de Janeiro, discovering locations to record sounds; he recorded chickens, which were used in the game as the voices of rats. The team continued to add and change the game's sounds until the end of development.|$|E
