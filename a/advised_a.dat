5|$|Despite these {{economic}} indicators, the Budget presented in August 1974 saw large increases in spending, especially in education. Treasury officials had <b>advised</b> <b>a</b> series of tax and fee increases, ranging from excise taxes {{to the cost}} of posting a letter; their advice was mostly rejected by Cabinet. The Budget was unsuccessful in dealing with the inflation and unemployment, and Whitlam introduced large tax cuts in November. He also announced additional spending to help the private sector.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} {{consumption of}} alcohol was recognized as a problem by Dr. Eli Todd in 1812. In a conversation with Edward Hooker on March 30, 1812, he stated {{that there was no}} single solution to alcoholism. “He <b>advised</b> <b>a</b> 3-pronged attack that was as follows: there should be an association of respectable men who would make it unfashionable to take ardent spirits; work houses of ‘idle, drinking persons’ after their third conviction for drunkenness; and heavy taxes on imported and domestic liquor”.|$|E
5|$|Walsingham {{advocated}} {{direct intervention}} in the Netherlands {{in support of the}} Protestant revolt against Spain, on the grounds that although wars of conquest were unjust, wars in defence of religious liberty and freedom were not.

In the spring of 1832, a blacksmith named William Davis dammed the creek to provide power for his sawmill. Meau-eus, the principal chief of the small Potawatomi village, protested to Davis that the dam prevented fish from reaching the village.

25|$|While nasal {{irrigation}} can {{be carried}} out using ordinary tap water, this is potentially unsafe and can be uncomfortable because it irritates the mucous membranes. Therefore, an isotonic or hypertonic salt water solution is normally used, i.e. water with enough salt to match the tonicity of the body cells and blood. For the same reason, lukewarm water is preferred over cold water, which in addition to irritating nasal membranes can also exaggerate the gag reflex during irrigation. Use of distilled, sterile or previously boiled and cooled water over ordinary tap water is <b>advised.</b> <b>A</b> small amount of baking soda is sometimes employed as a buffering agent to neutralize the pH of the irrigating solution.|$|E
25|$|Michael Oft’s was {{a teacher}} in Virginia who had no prior {{psychiatric}} nor deviant behavior history. At the age of forty, his behavior suddenly changed. He began to frequent massage parlors, collect child pornography, abuse his step-daughter, and was soon found guilty of child molestation. Mr. Oft opted for a treatment program for pedophiles, but still couldn’t resist soliciting sexual favors from staff and other clients at the rehabilitation center. A neurologist <b>advised</b> <b>a</b> brain scan, which showed a tumor growing {{at the base of}} his orbitofrontal cortex, compressing the right prefrontal region of his brain. After the tumor was removed, Mr. Oft’s emotion, behavior and sexual activity returned to normal. But after several months of normal behavior Mr. Oft again began to collect child pornography. Neurologists rescanned his brain and found that the tumor had grown back. After the second surgery removing the tumor, his behavior have been totally appropriate.|$|E
25|$|From 1950 to 1957, Tordoff was {{a faculty}} member at the University of Kansas and a {{researcher}} at Kansas' Natural History Museum. While at Kansas, he collaborated with a number of other ornithologists, including Mengel, Glen Woolfenden, and Norman A. Ford; together, they are said to have raised standards for ornithological museum work. Tordoff edited The Wilson Bulletin, the journal of the Wilson Ornithological Society, from 1952 to 1954. During that time, he convinced a local printer, Ayle Allen, to print the journal, and their collaboration eventually grew into Allen Press, a prominent publisher of scientific journals and books. In 1957 Tordoff moved his family back to Ann Arbor where he replaced Van Tyne as {{a faculty member}} at the University of Michigan, becoming curator of birds at the Museum of Zoology. There he <b>advised</b> <b>a</b> number of graduate students who went on to have distinguished careers, among them Frank Gill.|$|E

25|$|On 12 February 1971 {{testimony}} was completed and a verdict expected. However, in March the court <b>advised</b> <b>a</b> settlement, explaining appeals were extremely time consuming. Negotiations began on 22 March and concluded on 24 December, {{three and a}} half years after the case had begun. Nikkatsu paid Suzuki ¥1000000, a fraction of his original claim, and Hori was forced to apologize for comments he made while serving as president. In a separate agreement Nikkatsu donated Fighting Elegy and Branded to Kill to the Tokyo National Museum of Modern Art's Film Centre. At the time of settlement Suzuki expressed fears that if he had continued to fight he might not even be able to get an apology from the failing company. During the course of the litigation Nikkatsu was being slowly dismantled. Hori's plans to restructure the company were unsuccessful and Nikkatsu was forced to liquidate studios and headquarter buildings. It released two final films in August 1971 and by November began producing roman poruno, softcore romantic pornography. Despite Suzuki's victory with wide support from the public and film world he was blacklisted by all major production companies and unable to make another film for 10 years.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 22 September, Jones in Bonhomme Richard (an armed East India trading vessel he had reluctantly adapted for {{military}} use), accompanied by the little brigantine Vengeance, had been off Spurn Head, hoping to catch a few prizes emerging from the Humber estuary, but he decided to head northward during the hours of darkness, and rendezvous with his frigates Alliance and Pallas, which had parted company from him further up the coast. Shortly after midnight, two vessels were seen, so signal lanterns were set. The strangers did not give the response that would identify them as members of his squadron. Jones’s crew was called to quarters, but when daylight approached, about 5:30am, and a chequered flag was hoisted on the mizzen mast, the mystery vessels finally identified themselves as the Alliance and Pallas. Captain Cottineau of the Pallas (in full, Denis Nicolas Cottineau de Kerloguen) later reported that Captain Pierre Landais of the Alliance had <b>advised</b> <b>a</b> rapid retreat if the approaching warship proved to be British—not a reassuring suggestion, given that his frigate, which had been acclaimed as the best warship yet made in America, was by a fair margin the faster and more manoeuvrable of the two.|$|E
25|$|It {{was rumored}} that Ahmadinejad would run for {{presidency}} again in 2017 after {{he did not}} deny plans when questioned by the media in 2015. Ahmadinejad remained mostly {{out of the public}} eye since leaving office, but his anti-Western rhetoric and combative style remained popular among many Iranian Principlists, and he was widely viewed as among the most formidable political figures capable of unseating Hassan Rouhani. In December 2015, it was reported that he had begun his presidential campaign by appointing his campaign's chiefs. He also began provincial travels in April 2016 by traveling to Amol. Travels were continued until September 2016, when he traveled to Gorgan. Ahmadinejad's advisors said his travels were not electoral and he only delivered speeches due to public demand. In September 2016, it was rumored that Ahmadinejad had asked Ali Khamenei, Supreme Leader of Iran, for permission to run for the office and was rejected by Khamenei, who said that it was not in the best interests of Iran. On 26 September 2016, Ayatollah Khamenei confirmed the news, stated that it was only advice, not an order. It was the first time since Khamenei's election as Supreme Leader in 1989 that he <b>advised</b> <b>a</b> person to not run for election. Formerly, some candidates had asked him for advice (former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani for his campaign in 2005 and 2013), but Khamenei chose to not give his opinion on those occasions. The following day, Ahmadinejad officially announced he will not run in the upcoming 2017 presidential election. He later supported Hamid Baqai's candidacy. However, Ahmadinejad registered as presidential candidate on 12 April 2017. He was disqualified by the Guardian Council on 20 April 2017, making him the second person after Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to be barred from running the office for a third term.|$|E
