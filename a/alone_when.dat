5|$|Mary wielded {{less power}} than William {{when he was}} in England, ceding most of her {{authority}} to him, though he heavily relied on her. She did, however, act <b>alone</b> <b>when</b> William was engaged in military campaigns abroad, proving herself to be a powerful, firm, and effective ruler.|$|E

5|$|John F. Kennedy {{was assassinated}} at 12:30p.m. Central Standard Time (18:30 UTC) on Friday, November 22, 1963, in Dealey Plaza, Dallas, Texas. Kennedy was fatally shot while {{traveling}} {{with his wife}} Jacqueline, Texas Governor John Connally, and the latter's wife Nellie, in a Presidential motorcade. The ten-month investigation by the Warren Commission of 1963–1964 concluded that President Kennedy was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald and that Oswald had acted entirely alone. It also concluded that Jack Ruby acted <b>alone</b> <b>when</b> he killed Oswald in police custody. Nonetheless, polls conducted from 1966 to 2004 found {{that as many as}} 80 percent of Americans have suspected that there was a plot or cover-up.|$|E

5|$|The winery {{had been}} founded by both {{his father and}} his {{grandfather}}, Hermann Schnaufer, in 1919, shortly after World War I. Following the death of his grandfather in 1928 the winery was run by his father <b>alone.</b> <b>When</b> his father unexpectedly died in 1940, his mother ran the business until the children took over the winery after World War II. The company then expanded the business and in addition to the winery offered wine imports, sparkling wines, and a distillery for wine and liqueur. The distribution channel worked with agents and sales offices throughout Germany.|$|E
5|$|Union troops retreated in {{different}} states of order. The brigades on Seminary Ridge {{were said to}} move deliberately and slowly, keeping in control, although Col. Wainwright's artillery was not informed of the order to retreat and found themselves <b>alone.</b> <b>When</b> Wainwright realized his situation, he ordered his gun crews to withdraw at a walk, not wishing to panic the infantry and start a rout. As pressure eventually increased, Wainwright ordered his 17 remaining guns to gallop down Chambersburg Street, three abreast. A.P. Hill failed to commit any of his reserves {{to the pursuit of}} the Seminary defenders, a great missed opportunity.|$|E
5|$|During that operation, American {{soldiers}} initially {{made only}} limited {{contact with the}} Viet Cong, but defeated enemy troops in two separate battles. On June 17 the 1/16th infantry battalion, re-enforced by a company of 2/28th infantry engaged in a six-hour battle supported by airstrikes and massive artillery. The majority of the casualties suffered from that engagement <b>alone,</b> <b>when</b> the operation concluded on June 26, the 1st Infantry Division had lost 57 soldiers dead and 197 wounded. Then in September, following a string of attacks on allied military installations by Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troops, Major General John H. Hay decided to temporarily stop conducting large-scale operations until the true intentions of Communist forces were known. Towards October, the Viet Cong 271st Regiment marched into the Long Nguyen Secret Zone, to rest and refit for their next major operation. To disrupt the Viet Cong's resting period, General Hay launched Operation Shenandoah II to clear a section of National Highway 13 which stretched from Chon Thanh to Loc Ninh.|$|E

5|$|On a whim, Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara), a young {{reporter}} for the Washington Herald who is stuck covering trivial “human interest” stories, pays a late-night visit to Frank at his home. She offers to be Frank’s undercover mouthpiece in the press {{in exchange for the}} elevated profile that she would gain from breaking substantive stories. Meanwhile, Peter Russo (Corey Stoll), a young, inexperienced congressman from Philadelphia, is arrested for drunk driving. Stamper finds out about the arrest and immediately contacts the D.C. police commissioner, offering Underwood’s support for his mayoral campaign in exchange for releasing Russo and completely covering up the incident. Russo is picked up from jail by his secretary and romantic partner, Christina Gallagher (Kristen Connolly). He lies to her, telling her that he was <b>alone</b> <b>when</b> he was arrested when, in fact, there was a prostitute (Rachel Brosnahan) in the car.|$|E
5|$|Some {{weeks after}} their encounter, word reached Le Gris of accusations being made against him by Carrouges and his wife. It {{will never be}} known what basis these {{allegations}} had in fact but Carrouges claimed that on 18 January 1386, whilst Carrouges was still in Paris, Le Gris had entered the chateau of Carrouges' mother Nicole and there raped Marguerite. According to Marguerite de Carrouges' testimony, a squire in Le Gris' employ named Adam Louvel had {{knocked on the door}} of the chateau and demanded entry. All the servants were attending to Dame Nicole de Carrouges, who was visiting a neighbouring town on legal business, and so Marguerite was <b>alone</b> <b>when</b> Louvel called. Once inside, Louvel gave Marguerite a message that Le Gris was outside and desired to see her because he was passionately in love with her. Although Marguerite protested, Le Gris broke into the house and propositioned her, offering money in exchange. When Marguerite refused, Le Gris attempted to take her by force and raped her on the bed in her chamber with the help of Louvel. As Le Gris departed, he threatened her with violence if she told of the encounter.|$|E
5|$|Similar to its predecessor, Watch Dogs 2 is an action-adventure {{game with}} stealth {{elements}} and played from a third-person perspective as protagonist Marcus Holloway, a young hacker, the game features an open world environment {{set in a}} fictionalized version of the San Francisco Bay Area, an area {{more than twice as}} large as the Chicago setting from Watch Dogs. The Bay Area consists of four different areas: San Francisco, Oakland, Marin, and Silicon Valley, all of which have different characteristics and aesthetics. Players can navigate the game's world on-foot or by the various vehicles featured in the game, such as cars, trucks, buses, cable cars, motorcycles, quad bikes and boats. The driving mechanic was overhauled and designed to be more accessible. The players can shoot their weapons while driving. Marcus also has improved acrobatic skills, and the ability to parkour around the city. Players can use different methods to approach the game's missions, choosing between the aggressive approach, in which they defeat enemies with guns which are made with a 3D printer; explosives, like mines; or Marcus' own melee weapon, a billiard ball attached to a bungee cord. Alternatively, players can use the stealth approach, in which they can evade enemies or paralyze them temporarily with Marcus' taser. Players can also complete the game through hacking <b>alone.</b> <b>When</b> players commit too many crimes, the police officers will become alerted and will attempt to arrest the player. The game upgrades system is a returning feature, with items being divided into three categories: Ghost, Aggressor, and Trickster. Players can choose their upgrades in accordance with their own playstyle.|$|E
40|$|The {{percentage}} of dark, light, and intermediate osteons and their fragments, {{as seen in}} polarized light, was determined for 53 cross-sections of embalmed, adult human bone. Dark osteons have collagen fibers predominantly parallel with the long axis of the osteon while in light osteons the fibers are at a sharp angle to the long axis of the osteon. Intermediate osteons are mixed. Significant positive correlations were found between dark osteons alone, as well as when combined with their fragments, and the single shearing strength. Intermediate osteons <b>alone,</b> and <b>when</b> combined with their fragments, showed significant positive correlations with the (1) single shearing strength, (2) modulus of elasticity, and (3) percent elongation. Significant negative correlations were found between light osteons <b>alone,</b> and <b>when</b> combined with their fragments, and the (1) single shearing strength and (2) modulus of elasticity. No other significant correlations were found among {{the various types of}} osteons <b>alone,</b> or <b>when</b> combined with their fragments, and the mechanical properties of the specimens...|$|R
50|$|There are no {{specific}} contraindications for sofosbuvir <b>when</b> used <b>alone.</b> However, <b>when</b> used {{in combination with}} ribavirin or peginterferon alfa/ribavirin, or others, the contraindications applicable to these agents are applied.|$|R

25|$|Stern {{trawlers}} – have trawls {{which are}} deployed and retrieved from the stern. Larger stern trawlers {{often have a}} ramp, though pelagic and small stern trawlers are often designed without a ramp. Stern trawlers are designed to operate in most weather conditions.

25|$|Radical prostatectomy has {{traditionally}} been used <b>alone</b> <b>when</b> the cancer is localized to the prostate. In the event of positive margins or locally advanced disease found on pathology, adjuvant radiation therapy may offer improved survival. Surgery may also be offered when a cancer is not responding to radiation therapy. However, because radiation therapy causes tissue changes, prostatectomy after radiation has higher risks of complications.|$|E

25|$|NS5 : the {{presence}} of this 105 kDa protein results in inactivation of STAT2 (via the signal transduction of the response to interferon) when it is expressed <b>alone.</b> <b>When</b> NS5 is cleaved with NS4B by a protease (NS2B3) it can degrade STAT2. In fact, after the cleavage of NS5 by the protease, there is an E3 ligase association with STAT2, and the E3 ligase targets STAT2 for the degradation.|$|E
