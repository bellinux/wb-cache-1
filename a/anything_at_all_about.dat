Indeed, some {{go so far as}} to question whether there is <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> distinctive <b>about</b> religions. Hence, formulating a definition of "religion" that can command wide assent has proven to be an extremely difficult task. In this article I consider the most prominent of the many rival definitions that have been proposed, the majority falling within three basic types: intellectual, affective and functional definitions. I conclude that there are pragmatic reasons for favouring the formerly popular view that essentialist definitions of "religions" are inadequate, and that religions should be construed, instead, as possessing a number of "family resemblances". In so arguing, I provide a response to the view that there is nothing distinctive about religions, as well as to the recent claim that religions do not exist...|$|R

[...] Where Zobels {{come into their}} own is in frequency equalisation applications, particularly on transmission lines.

[...] For most filter types, this variation in impedance will cause {{a significant difference in}} response to the theoretical, and is mathematically difficult to compensate for, even assuming that the impedance is known precisely. [...] If Zobel {{networks are}} used however, it is only necessary to measure the line response into a fixed resistive load and then design an equaliser to compensate it. [...] It is entirely unnecessary to know <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> the line impedance as the Zobel network will present exactly the same impedance to line as the measuring instruments.

6000|$|I {{was driving}} {{yesterday}} afternoon in a hansom cab {{down one of}} the sloping streets into the Strand, reading one of my own admirable articles with continual pleasure, and still more continual surprise, when the horse fell forward, scrambled a moment on the scraping stones, staggered to his feet again, and went forward. The horses in my cabs often do this, and I have learnt to enjoy my own articles at any angle of the vehicle. So I did not see <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> odd <b>about</b> the way the horse went on again. But I saw it suddenly in the faces of all the people on the pavement. They were all turned towards me, and they were all struck with fear suddenly, as with a white flame out of the sky. And one man half ran out into the road with a movement of the elbow as if warding off a blow, and tried to stop the horse. Then I knew that the reins were lost, and the next moment the horse was like a living thunder-bolt. I try to describe things exactly as they seemed to me; many details I may have missed or mis-stated; many details may have, so to speak, gone mad in the race down the road.

60|$|De Maistre was the {{greatest}} of the three, and deserves better than either of the others to stand as the type of the school for many reasons. His style is so marvellously lucid, that, notwithstanding the mystical, or, as he said, the illuminist side of his mind, we can never be in much doubt about his meaning, which is {{not by any means}} the case with Bonald. To say nothing of his immensely superior natural capacity, De Maistre's extensive reading in the literature of his foes was a source of strength, which might indeed have been thought indispensable, if only other persons had not attacked the same people as he did, without knowing much or <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>at</b> first-hand <b>about</b> them. Then he goes over the whole field of allied subjects, which {{we have a right to}} expect to have handled by anybody with a systematic view of the origin of knowledge, the meaning of ethics, the elements of social order and progressiveness, the government and scheme of the universe. And above all, his writings are penetrated with the air of reality and life, which comes of actual participation in the affairs of that world with which social philosophers have to deal. Lamennais had in many respects a finer mind than De Maistre, but the conclusions in which he was finally landed, no less than his liberal aims, prevent him from being an example of the truly Catholic reaction. He obviously represented the Revolution, or the critical spirit, within the Catholic limits, while De Maistre's ruling idea was, in his own trenchant phrase, 'absolument tuer l'esprit du dix-huitième siècle.' On all these accounts he appears to be the fittest expositor of those conceptions which the anarchy that closed the eighteenth century provoked into systematic existence.|$|R

40|$|The National Institute of Agricultural Botany, {{founded in}} 1919 and still {{operating}} today from its same Cambridge headquarters, {{is one of}} Britain’s oldest agricultural science institutes. Using the extensive and hitherto unexamined archive materials held by NIAB, this thesis offers both a new history of the Institute from 1919 to 1969, and an analysis of that history {{in the light of}} wider historiographies of science. It is well known that state patronage of science in Britain entered a new phase {{towards the end of the}} nineteenth century. The number of national laboratories, organisations, and institutions dedicated to scientific work grew rapidly, as did the number of professional scientists. The agricultural sciences and their institution’s benefited as much, if not more, from the state’s newfound interest in science, and yet hardly <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> is known <b>about</b> them. This historiographical oversight is all the more troubling when one considers the changes that took place within British agriculture and the global food industry at this time. The thesis makes three important new points in particular. Firstly, that scientific regulatory bodies (often marginalized in preference for basic research centres) offer a valuable new perspective for historians interested in relations between science and the state. Secondly, that the techniques used during regulation and assessment (which draw upon the latest scientific developments and theories), can reveal a great deal about an institution’s social location. Finally, appreciating the perspective on variation and heredity held by agricultural scientists and plant breeders, one which will be shown to be quite different from more general biologists, offers solutions and problems for contemporary historiography on issues ranging from the impact of Mendelism on plant breeding to the history of plant patenting. ...|$|R

40|$|Michel Foucault is a {{major source}} for the idea in {{critical}} accounting and organizational studies that identities (selves, subjectivities) are discursively constituted. This return to the text is intended as a clarification of what Foucault actually says on this matter and an assessment of how far it {{can be regarded as}} authoritative. The major conclusions are as follows. The subject matter of Foucault's 'discursive' phase is not discourse in its generality but islands of organization ('discursive formations') within it. To all intents and purposes these are bodies of knowledge and Foucault's focus is on those which he calls 'human sciences'. His concern is to show that these can be understood as a rule-governed systems of discursive events. The alternative of an action-theoretic account is ruled out by Foucault's declared intention of avoiding recourse to a concept of human agency. Thus Foucault does not theorize discourse as an expression of human subjectivity. Rather he theorizes the subject as an image of the human being which is produced by, and presumed in, self-organizing systems of knowledge. In Foucault's work up to and including the Archaeology of Knowledge, therefore, the discursively constructed subject is not a flesh-and-blood human being <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> It is a thought-object constructed by, and within, the human sciences. Because {{there are a number of}} human sciences there are a corresponding number of constituted subjects, each of which, in the first instance, has currency only within its parent knowledge. In Foucault's earlier Order of Things, however, a unitary 'contemporary subject' is theorized as a composite of these constructs. Since the constituting discourses are depicted as evolving autonomously, Foucault is thus able to produce a history of 'the different modes by which [...] . human beings are made subjects'. All this means that any support from Foucault for the idea that subjectivities are discursively constituted in actuality must rest on Foucault's genealogical phase. In Discipline and Punish, the human sciences are depicted, not as self-organizing fields of knowledge, but as the theoretical arms of various regimes of behavioural correction. Foucault is convincing in his claim that this 'power-knowledge' has diffused outwards from the total institutions in which it was prototyped, thence to become the characteristically modern modality of power. He is much less convincing on the question of its effects. Despite Foucault's talk of 'shaping the soul', in fact, it is not clear that he has <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> to say <b>about</b> this. The problem is that all of his descriptions of the various disciplinary orders are 'top down' accounts, relying either on the programmes of legal theorists and institutional reformers or on observation of institutional routines by official inspectors. The voice of the inmate is absent entirely, as is any evidence that disciplinary regimes achieve anything more than a calculative conformity to their behavioural dictates. This is not to deny that disciplinary power may impact on subjectivities. The point here is that such an effect needs to be evidenced rather than simply assumed on the basis of (what has been taken to be) Foucault's say-so. In critical accounting, unfortunately, the tendency has been to treat accounting as a discursive system or regime of power-knowledge and then cite Foucault as if this were sufficient to establish that it works through the production of subjectivities. The paper concludes with a discussion of two recent examples, one of which appeals to a concept of discursive constitution and one to the concept of power-knowledge. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|R
