40|$|<b>Arildone</b> (WIN 38020; 4 -[6 -(2 -chloro- 4 -methoxyphenoxy) hexyl]- 3, 5 -heptanedione) {{inhibited}} the infectivity {{of acute}} hemorrhagic conjunctivitis viruses in tissue culture. <b>Arildone</b> did not inhibit interferon (IFN) production or IFN activity.

40|$|<b>Arildone,</b> a novel {{antiviral}} agent which blocks virion uncoating, {{was assessed}} {{for its ability}} to prevent paralysis and death in mice infected intracerebrally with a lethal dose of human poliovirus type- 2 (strain MEF). Intraperitoneal administration of <b>arildone</b> suspended in gum tragacanth prevented paralysis and death in a dose-dependent manner (minimal inhibitory dose = 32 mg/kg, twice daily) and protected animals from virus challenges in excess of 20 50 % lethal doses. Oral medication with <b>arildone</b> solubilized in corn oil was similarly effective in preventing poliovirus-induced paralysis and death. <b>Arildone</b> was therapeutically effective even when intraperitoneal medication was delayed for 48 h postinfection. Analysis of the virus titers in the central nervous system tissues of animals infected with 200 50 % lethal doses demonstrated that <b>arildone</b> reduced titers in the brain and spine by approximately 3 and 4 log 10 PFU per g of tissue, respectively, implying that direct inhibition of virus replication was responsible for host survival. <b>Arildone</b> is the first antiviral agent capable of preventing poliovirus-induced death in mice. The efficient inhibition of poliovirus replication described here demonstrates the potential usefulness of uncoating blockers in the systemic treatment of viral diseases...|$|E
40|$|<b>Arildone</b> (also {{known as}} Win 38020), a novel aryl diketone, {{inhibited}} replication of {{herpes simplex virus}} type 2 in tissue culture by interfering with an event that occurs prior to 6 h postinfection. The inhibition could be partially reversed by washing. Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, neither viral deoxyribonucleic acid nor viral proteins were synthesized {{in the presence of}} <b>arildone...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{existence}} of synergistic drug combinations against the in vitro replication of poliovirus type 1 (Mahoney) (PV- 1) {{had been established}} in our previous work. The objective {{of the present study}} was to test the combined effects of the different drugs against another representative of the enterovirus genus, i. e. Coxsackievirus B 1 (CBV- 1). Dual combinations of enviroxime, disoxaril, <b>arildone,</b> PTU- 23, HBB and S- 7 were evaluated. The susceptibility of CBV- 1 to the individual effects of the inhibitors was compared to that of PV- 1. CBV- 1 was more sensitive to enviroxime, S- 7, PTU- 23 and HBB and less sensitive to the effects of disoxaril and <b>arildone.</b> The effect of most dual drug combinations tested against CBV- 1 replication was additive or synergistic. Enviroxime and S- 7, enviroxime and PTU- 23, disoxaril and HBB, disoxaril and PTU- 23, <b>arildone</b> and HBB, <b>arildone</b> and PTU- 23, S- 7 and HBB revealed a strong synergistic effect. Synergy against CBV- 1 replication was stronger as compared to that noted for the same drug combinations against PV- 1 replication...|$|E
40|$|<b>Arildone</b> is an aryl {{diketone}} {{which is}} inhibitory in vitro against {{herpes simplex virus}} type 2 at a concentration of 2 micrograms/ml or less. One hundred forty-five patients with recurrent genital herpes were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an 8 % <b>arildone</b> cream. Patients initiated therapy a mean of 9. 9 h and a maximum of 24 h after the reported onset of lesions and applied medication 6 times daily for 7 days. The duration of viral shedding was shorter among women (P less than 0. 05) and the duration of local itching was shorter among men (P less than 0. 05) in patients that received <b>arildone</b> than in those that received placebo, {{but there were no}} significant differences between treatment groups in duration of pain, time to crusting or healing of lesions, or percentage of patients developing new lesions. Mild local irritation after application of ointment was common and occurred equally in both treatment groups. Despite early application, topical <b>arildone</b> cream was ineffective in the therapy of acute recurrences of genital herpes...|$|E
40|$|<b>Arildone</b> (3 micro/ml) {{reduced the}} {{replication}} of murine cytomegalovirus, Semliki Forest virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and coxsackievirus A 9 by 64, 68, 94, and 98 %, respectively. When the plaque reduction method {{was used to}} evaluate the antiviral effect for the viruses, a concentration of 3 to 5 micrograms/ml yielded a 50 % reduction in plaque numbers. The effect of <b>arildone</b> on virus replication was greatest when the drug was present from the time of inoculation. The effectiveness decreased as the time interval from the inoculation of the virus to the addition of the drug increased. The removal of the drug from infected cells by washing readily reversed the effect, and viral replication resumed at a significant level. Infectivity of these viruses was not inactivated by the drug. Tissue culture cells used for viral growth and assay grew well in <b>arildone</b> (3 micrograms/ml), with cell yields that were comparable to those for cultures in the absence of drug. At 3 micrograms/ml there were minimal effects of the drug on the uptake of 3 H-labeled amino acids and [3 H]-thymidine into cells. Furthermore, incorporation of these precursors was not affected. However, there was a reduction in uptake of [3 H]uridine into the acid-soluble pool and a concomitant reduction in incorporation into acid-insoluble counts...|$|E
40|$|Dichloroflavan {{was found}} to {{stabilize}} rhinovirus IB to inactivation by heat at 56 °C or by acid at pH 4 - 6 to 50. The effects of dichloroflavan, <b>arildone</b> and sodium dodecyl sulphate on uncoating of virus in M. HeLa cells were compared by examining (a) the production of sub-viral particles separated on sucrose density gradients; (b) the development of photoresistance by neutral red labelled virus. All three compounds significantly reduced but did not completely suppress the production of sub-viral particles. They also affected the uncoating of neutral red labelled virus, although dichloroflavan appeared to delay rather than prevent this process. A variant of rhinovirus 1 B, isolated by growth {{in the presence of}} dichloroflavan, showed increased resistance to inhibition by <b>arildone</b> and SDS as well as dichloro-flavan, suggesting a similar site of action for the three compounds...|$|E
40|$|Obtaining of {{substances}} suppressing replication of caliciviruses is {{of special interest}} due to their particular role in the veterinary and human infectious pathology. Investigations for development of effective anti-calicivirus chemotherapy are important {{due to lack of}} specific means for calicivirus infections treatment. Caliciviridae possess a RNA(+) genome and similar structure as Picornaviridae, but reveal a different genome strategy. In a view of some similarities, a screening for anti-calicivirus activity of several highly efficient inhibitors of picornavirus replication was carried out. Research was carried out with Feline calicivirus (FCV), Crandell’s Feline Kidney cell line (CrFK) and the following compounds: <b>Arildone,</b> Disoxaril, S- 7, Guanidine hydrochloride, PTU- 23, HBB, Ribavirin and Oxoglaucine. Anti-calicivirus activity and citotoxicity were tested through CPE inhibition test and neutral red uptake assay (vs. virus inoculating doses ranging within 1 and 10 000 CCID 50). Significant effects of HBB, PTU- 23, Ribavirin and Oxoglaucine and a slight activity of S- 7 were indicated, while <b>Arildone,</b> Disoxaril and Guanidine hydrochloride did not show influence...|$|E
40|$|Preparations ofpurified {{poliovirus}} type 1, strain Mahoney, {{and empty}} viral capsids contain aprotein kinase activity. The y-phosphoryl group of [32 p]AT P {{is transferred to}} all of the capsid proteins. Viral proteins phosphorylated in vitro are recognized by antiserum directed against isolated viral capsid proteins, indicating that phosphoryla-tion does not alter the antigenic sites {{to such an extent that}} the recognition by antibodies i abolished. Viral capsid protein phosphorylation exposes new antigenic sites and leads to a destabilization f the virions. The transfer of 32 p to viral proteins is linear for 90 min at 37 °C in the presence of 10 mM-Mg 2 + at pH 8 - 1. Reducing agents or virus-stabilizing agents (such as <b>arildone)</b> reduce the kinase ctivity and result in a different pattern of capsid protein phosphorylation...|$|E
