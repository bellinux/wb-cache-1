50|$|With {{a closed}} system, {{vehicles}} collect a ticket when entering the highway. In some cases, the ticket displays the toll {{to be paid}} on exit. Upon exit, the driver must pay the amount listed for the given exit. Should the ticket be lost, a driver must typically pay the maximum amount possible for travel on that highway. Short toll roads with no intermediate entries or exits may have only one toll plaza at one end, with motorists traveling in either direction paying a flat fee either when they enter or when they exit the toll road. In {{a variant of the}} closed toll system, mainline barriers are present at the two endpoints of the toll road, and each interchange has a ramp toll that is paid upon exit or entry. In this case, a motorist pays a flat fee at the ramp toll and another flat fee {{at the end of the}} toll road; no ticket is necessary. In addition, with most systems, motorists may only pay tolls with cash and/or change; debit <b>and</b> <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> are not <b>accepted.</b> However, some toll roads may have travel plazas with ATMs so motorists can stop and withdraw cash for the tolls.|$|R

50|$|In Australia, debit <b>and</b> <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> are {{the most}} common {{non-cash}} payment methods at “points of sale” (POS) or via ATMs. Not all merchants provide eftpos facilities, but those who wish to accept eftpos payments must enter an agreement with one of the seven merchant service providers, which rent an eftpos terminal to the merchant. The eftpos system in Australia is managed by Eftpos Payments Australia Ltd, which also sets the EFTPOS interchange fee. For <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> to be <b>accepted</b> by a merchant a separate agreement must be entered into with each <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> company, each of which has its own flexible merchant fee rate.|$|R

2500|$|Unlike other {{attempts}} at creating a <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> to rival MasterCard and Visa, such as Citibank's Choice card, the Discover Card gained a large national consumer base. It carried no annual fee, which was uncommon at the time, {{and offered a}} typically higher credit limit than similar cards. Cardholders could also earn a [...] "Cashback Bonus," [...] in which {{a percentage of the}} amount spent would be refunded to the account (from 1% to 5%), depending on how much the card was used. A 1989 study found that the Discover card had strong consumer adoption in the U.S.; the number of households with Discover cards increased by 2.1 million, or 14 percent, in 1989. The Discover Card was also noteworthy for being the only <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>accepted</b> by the U.S. Customs Service to pay customs duty, effective Feb. 19, 1987. Due to its not charging a percentage fee to retailers, unlike Visa, MasterCard, and American Express, Discover Card was also the only <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>accepted</b> at Sam's Club; the retailer has since started to accept MasterCard, and American Express (see below).|$|R
