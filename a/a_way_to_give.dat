5|$|Gaudí {{is usually}} {{considered}} the great master of Catalan Modernism, but his works go beyond any one style or classification. They are imaginative works that find their main inspiration in nature. Gaudí studied organic and anarchic geometric forms of nature thoroughly, searching for <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> expression to these forms in architecture. Some {{of his greatest}} inspirations came from visits to the mountain of Montserrat, the caves of Mallorca, the saltpetre caves in Collbató, the crag of Fra Guerau in the Prades Mountains behind Reus, the Pareis mountain {{in the north of}} Mallorca and Sant Miquel del Fai in Bigues i Riells.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} evening Hare took the stand to give evidence. Under {{cross-examination}} about the murder of Docherty, Hare claimed Burke had been the sole murderer and McDougal had twice been involved by bringing Docherty {{back to the house}} after she had run out; Hare stated that he had assisted Burke in the delivery of the body to Knox. Although he was asked about other murders, he was not obliged to answer the questions, as the charge related only to the death of Docherty. After Hare's questioning, his wife entered the witness box, carrying their baby daughter who was suffering from whooping cough. Margaret used the child's coughing fits as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> herself thinking time for some of the questions, and told the court that she had a very poor memory and could not remember many of the events.|$|E

The writers created the safehouse as an unoccupied house the family keep for emergencies and where various items, such as the promotional cutout of Silvio for the Bada Bing!, are stored.|$|E

25|$|In general, cattlemen did {{not feel}} that fencing was wrong. They {{believed}} they were fencing land unsuitable for any other uses, especially farming. Further, they believed a method of leasing land was <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> value to the government land in the Sandhills and allow fencing to be legal. The House Committee on Public Lands held hearings on leasing and grazing legislation between January and June 1902.|$|E
25|$|In late 1992, Yeltsin {{launched}} {{a program of}} free vouchers as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> mass privatization a jump-start. Under the program, all Russian citizens were issued vouchers, each with a nominal value of around 10,000 rubles, for purchase of shares of select state enterprises. Although each citizen initially received a voucher of equal face value, within months most of them converged {{in the hands of}} intermediaries who were ready to buy them for cash right away.|$|E
25|$|Powell again {{represented}} Charlemont High at the ISSA High School Boy And Girls Championships, finishing {{seventh in}} the Class 1 100m Final. Recognizing some talent, coach Stephen Francis started coaching Powell one week later. The coach looked for <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the tall teenager a faster start. After searching the island, Stephen Francis found a 100m stretch of road with a 10% slope and trains his runners on that. Powell vindicated Francis by winning the Boys Under-20 100nbsp&m event in 10.50nbsp&seconds at the JAAA National Championships on 22 June.|$|E

That lower bound was stronger than previous published bounds. Here, we use three variants of Gersgorin's theorem in <b>a</b> similar <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> further lower bounds. Each of the new bounds is more complicated, but generally stronger, than the pure Gersgorin-based bound. The three new bounds are mutually noncomparable...|$|R

These diaries are edited into broadband-friendly installments {{of three or four}} minutes each.

The song was released as the fourth and final single from the album. [...] "Criminal" [...] was written and produced by Max Martin and Shellback, with additional writing by Tiffany Amber. After Spears first listened to the song, she felt it was different and unlike anything she had heard before. She posted a snippet of it online on March 2, 2011, prior to the album's release. [...] "Criminal" [...] was chosen as a single by a poll on her Facebook page, as Spears explained it was <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> back to her fans.

500|$|David Duchovny {{initially}} suggested {{having a}} Walter Skinner-centric episode as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> himself a break, although ultimately he still {{ended up having}} a large part in the episode. Duchovny felt that Skinner was a good character who was not utilized to his full extent on the show. Duchovny's idea, which was written in collaboration with writer Howard Gordon, also surrounded the conceit that what Mulder and Skinner do comes with a tremendous price. Skinner's popularity amongst fans had risen with his increased role in the episodes [...] "The Blessing Way" [...] and [...] "Paper Clip" [...] and these episodes helped re-establish the ground rules regarding where Skinner stood {{in regards to the}} X-Files. Writer Vince Gilligan noted that Skinner was originally intended to be a bad guy, but because Mitch Pileggi was such a good actor the writers decided to not take his character in that direction.|$|E
500|$|Discussing the {{likelihood}} a Tangled sequel, Howard {{explained to the}} Los Angeles Times [...] "We don't {{want to do a}} sequel for the sake of sequels ... The story has to be worth telling." [...] Because the original film [...] "buttons up" [...] well, the directors wanted to avoid simply creating a movie wedding featuring Rapunzel and Flynn because [...] "that's not entertainment", so Greno and Howard conceived a funny story about Pascal and Maximus instead, providing the animators and writers with [...] "an opportunity {{to do a lot of}} slapstick" [...] that was mostly absent in Tangled. Wanting the film [...] "to be a movie for everyone", the directors [...] "figured out <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> [...] exactly what they wanted, so there is a beautiful grand wedding in the short, but what happens pretty quickly, those two goofballs Maximus and Pascal lose the wedding rings ... It turned into this big, zany, cartoony, fun, action-packed short." [...] In the short, Pascal and Maximus encounter [...] "a trail of comical chaos that includes flying lanterns, a flock of doves, a wine barrel barricade and a very sticky finale".|$|E

500|$|In November 2011, Marvel {{announced}} that Alan Silvestri, who scored Captain America: The First Avenger, would write and compose the score for The Avengers. Silvestri said, [...] "I've worked on films where {{there have been}} a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world and it's a very different situation. It's very challenging to look for <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> everyone the weight and consideration they need, but at the same time the film is really about the coming together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together." [...] Silvestri developed the score with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London, England. Whedon said, [...] "The score is very old-fashioned, which is why [...] was letter-perfect for this movie because he can give you the heightened emotion, the [...] school of 'I'm just feeling a lot right now!' but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific, which I love." ...|$|E
2500|$|The filmmaker would paradoxically retain his static {{compositions}} {{even when}} a character was shown walking or riding, by moving the camera with a dolly at the precise speed at which the actor or actors moved. He would drive his devoted cameraman, Yuharu Atsuta, to tears by insisting that actors and technicians count their steps precisely during a tracking shot so that the movements of actors and camera could be synchronized. Speaking of the bicycle ride to the beach early in the story, Peña notes: [...] "It’s almost as if Noriko [...] doesn’t seem to be moving, or Hattori’s not moving because his place within the frame remains constant… These are the sort of visual idiosyncrasies that make Ozu’s style so interesting and so unique in <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> us movement {{and at the same}} time to undercut movement." ...|$|E
