5|$|Another {{characteristic}} {{attributed to}} the ala is extreme voracity; in the Leskovac region, she was imagined as a monster with a huge mouth and a wooden spoon in her hand, with which she grabbed and devoured whatever came her way. According to a widely spread tradition, ale used to seize children and devour them in her dwelling, which was full of children’s bones and spilt blood. Less often, they attacked and ate adults; they were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> hidden human by smell.|$|E

5|$|Glee club {{director}} Will Schuester {{is informed}} that the school budget will not cover a handicap-accessible bus to transport the glee club to sectionals, which means that Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) will have to travel separately {{from the rest of}} the club. Will encourages the other club members to support Artie, not only by holding a bake sale to raise funds for a handicap bus, but also by spending time in wheelchairs to experience what life is like for him. Meanwhile, Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) is struggling to cover the medical expenses of her pregnancy, and threatens to break up with Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) if he cannot pay her ultrasound bill. Puck (Mark Salling) fights with Finn, whom he feels is not doing enough to support Quinn. By including cannabis in the cupcakes, Puck ensures the bake sale is a success and offers Quinn the money raised. She apologizes for previously calling him a loser, but refuses to accept the money, and is relieved when Finn is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> job.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the film}} went into production, the {{decision}} to shoot in Vancouver, rather than in Portland, came after debate on how to match the locations that were introduced in the first film. One member involved in the decision process pointed out that Vancouver had been scouted as a potential setting for Twilight, {{and it was only}} because the U.S. dollar had, at that time, dropped below the Canadian dollar that Oregon drew Twilight principal photography to Portland and its surrounding areas. Vancouver was chosen because it allowed a higher production value, while the surrounding areas contained beautiful forests and gray weather. With this decision, however, came the issue of reconstructing key sets that were used in the first film. For the exterior of Forks High School, crew members were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> parking lot, but the school's steps needed to be filmed with a greenscreen backing to match those that were originally presented in Twilight. David Thompson Secondary School would then be able to serve as the interior for the high school scenes.|$|E

25|$|In some cases, {{the vacuum}} of one {{observer}} {{is not even}} in the space of quantum states of the other.

25|$|As {{early as}} the 1st century BCE Jews {{believed}} that the Torah and other canonical texts contained encoded messages and hidden meanings.

The foundry was sold a few years later to new owners who {{recognized}} the boiler's value as a piece of history, and reportedly tried to sell it for $1,000 (equal to $ today) in 1874.

Measure across the fullest part of the breast, usually across the nipple, to where the breast tissue stops at the breast bone. This measuring approach assumes that the breasts are not so large or pendulous that they sag significantly, making measuring across the fullness of the breast impractical. Only women whose breasts are firm and spherical can measure without a bra.|$|E

These algorithms were sought long before the concept of NP-completeness was even defined (Karp's 21 NP-complete problems, among the first found, were all well-known existing problems at the time they were shown to be NP-complete). Furthermore, the result P = NP would imply many other startling results that are currently believed to be false, such as NP = co-NP and P = PH.|$|E

40|$|FinnWordNet is a Finnish wordnet which {{complies}} with {{the structure of the}} Princeton WordNet. It was created by translating all the words in Princeton WordNet. It is open source and contains over 117 000 synsets. We are now testing different methods in order to improve and expand the content of FinnWordNet. Since wordnets are structured ontologies, a location for a word in FinnWordNet can bepinpointed by its relations to other words. To us, finding a location for a word therefore means finding a hyperonym, a hyponym or a synonym for the word. This article describes some methods for finding a location for a new word in FinnWordNet. Our methods include searching for multiword terms, compounds and lexico-syntactic patterns. Testing shows that with a few simple methods, we were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>an</b> indicator of the location for 83. 2 % of new words.
