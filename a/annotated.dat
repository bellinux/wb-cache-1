40|$|Have {{you ever}} created a graph with SAS/GRAPH ® and really liked it … {{except for one}} little thing? The <b>Annotate</b> {{facility}} in SAS/GRAPH allows you to enhance or change features of your plot or chart. This presentation introduces <b>Annotate</b> and provides practical examples to illustrate how to improve your graphs. You {{do not need to}} be an expert at SAS/GRAPH to use <b>Annotate.</b> Even though <b>Annotate</b> is an extremely powerful tool for creating entirely custom figures, with a few guidelines (and the <b>Annotate</b> macros) it can be easy to use for simpler tasks. In this presentation, we will explain the principles behind <b>Annotate</b> and give specific examples of some common uses: adding a label to a single point on a graph, re-labeling an axis, adding a custom box of text, and applying “white out ” to unwanted text. You will learn basic building blocks of <b>Annotate</b> that can be applied to many different graph enhancement situations...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} macro, %CYARROW, {{that makes it}} easy to draw arrows using SAS ® /GRAPH’s {{superior}} <b>Annotate</b> facility. %CYARROW is specifically designed to be used in conjunction with %ANNOMAC macros, a set of SAS macros that provides a shortcut when creating an <b>Annotate</b> dataset. %CYARROW is an alternative to the undocumented (and “broken”) %ARROW macro. In addition to honoring the five standard options for the DRAW <b>Annotate</b> function (COLOR, HSYS, LINE, SIZE, and WHEN), %CYARROW offers sophisticated arrow shape options that control the length and the angle of the arrow tip and its aspect ratio. <b>ANNOTATE</b> DATA SET AND <b>ANNOTATE</b> MACROS The <b>Annotate</b> facility is a part of SAS/GRAPH. It is most commonly used to enhance graphics output by adding text and other graphic elements to them. It also creates advanced, custom graphics output from scratch in conjunction with PROC GANNO. In order to use the <b>Annotate</b> facility, one creates a dataset (an <b>Annotate</b> dataset) with specific variables and values. The <b>Annotate</b> dataset then is fed into a graphics procedure. The procedure, in turn, processes each observation of the <b>Annotate</b> dataset as an instruction to the facility. A good introduction to the <b>Annotate</b> facility is the, excellent, short volume by Carpenter(1999 a). Since the bulk of work in using <b>Annotate</b> facility lies in creating the <b>Annotate</b> dataset, SAS kindly provides a set of macros, %ANNOMAC, that significantly reduces the amount of work. As Rorie and Duncan(2003) demonstrate (also see Carpenter(1999 b)), a single %LINE() <b>Annotate</b> macro call can replace: (1) creating two observations; (2) assigning the function variable values (MOVE, for the first observation; and DRAW for the second); (3) assigning x and y coordinates for the starting and ending points of a line; and (4) assigning color, line type, and thickness. The %ANNOMAC includes %BAR to create a fillable rectangle, %LINE to draw a line, %SLICE to draw a pie slice, and %LABEL to write text at the specified location, to name a few. Our installation of SAS Release 9. 1. 2 includes the source code file for the %ANNOMAC macros (in the “SAS 9. 1 /core/sasmacro ” directory). To our delight, the source code includes an undocumented macro called %ARROW...|$|R

30|$|Finding {{polarity}} shifting patterns automatically in a corpus is not easy. The {{density of}} polarity shifting is normally low, and shifting patterns are subtle and flexible, making {{the task of}} extracting polarity shifting patterns difficult. Currently, human <b>annotating</b> is the main way to obtain polarity shifting patterns, which is time-consuming. This paper will present a semi-automatic approach to extracting polarity shifting patterns from specially designed corpora. This approach used sequence mining to generate frequent word sequences, which greatly reduced human labor in <b>annotating</b> polarity shifting patterns compared with <b>annotating</b> the original corpus directly.|$|R
