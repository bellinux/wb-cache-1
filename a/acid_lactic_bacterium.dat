Methods and Results: <b>Lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>bacteria</b> in three traditional fermented products in southern Africa (amasi, mahewu and tshwala) and in three fresh samples (two flowers and a fruit) were enrichment cultured in media supplemented with 13 different carbohydrates. Diversity of <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>bacteria</b> was determined by PCR-denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis. Carbohydrates used in enrichment media had a big impact on the isolation of <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>bacteria</b> from fermented products.

The Chinese research group have background on cereal vinegars concerning microbiology aspects and technology...|$|R
25|$|In industry, <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> {{fermentation}} {{is performed}} by <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>bacteria,</b> which convert simple carbohydrates such as glucose, sucrose, or galactose to <b>lactic</b> <b>acid.</b> These <b>bacteria</b> can also {{grow in the}} mouth; the acid they produce {{is responsible for the}} tooth decay known as caries.|$|R
50|$|Malolactic {{fermentation}} {{occurs when}} <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>bacteria</b> metabolize malic <b>acid</b> and produce <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> and carbon dioxide.

The presence of genes related to the virulence factors, production of biogenic amines, and vancomycin resistance were presented in low frequency in the studied <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>bacteria.</b> On the other hand, production of antimicrobial peptides and high spread of bacteriocin genes were broadly presented. Very strong activity against L. monocytogenes was detected {{in some of the}} studied <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>bacteria.</b> In addition, the studied strains did not present any antimicrobial activity against tested closely related bacteria such as Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., Enterococcus spp. or Pediococcus spp. To our knowledge this is the first study on the safety and antimicrobial properties of <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>bacteria</b> isolated from Bulgarian lukanka obtained by spontaneous fermentation...|$|R
