5|$|Goldfaden wandered Europe as a {{poet and}} journalist. His plays {{continued}} to be performed in Europe and America, but rarely, if ever, did anyone send him royalties. His health deteriorated – a 1903 letter refers to asthma <b>and</b> <b>spitting</b> up blood – and he {{was running out of}} money. In 1903, he wrote Jacob Dinesohn from Paris, authorizing him to sell his remaining possessions in Romania, clothes and all. This gave him the money to head once more to New York in 1904.|$|E
5|$|Fruit eating, or frugivory, {{is found}} in both major suborders. Bats prefer ripe fruit, pulling it off the trees with their teeth. They fly back to their roosts to eat the fruit, sucking out the juice <b>and</b> <b>spitting</b> the seeds and pulp out onto the ground. This helps {{disperse}} the seeds of these fruit trees, which may take root and grow where the bats have left them, and numerous species of plants depend on bats for seed dispersal. The Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) has been recorded carrying fruits weighing 3–14g (0.11–0.49oz) or even as much as 50g (1.8oz).|$|E

5|$|Using {{his various}} natural {{abilities}} and occasionally items or power-ups, Kirby must overcome obstacles while heading towards a goal door {{at end of}} the level, where he must fight a boss to obtain one of the Sparkling Stars. Most bosses are fought by sucking up the projectiles they create <b>and</b> <b>spitting</b> them back at the boss, however, the boss of the third level briefly turns the game into a Shoot 'em up. The last level before the final boss consists of a boss rush, where the player must fight all of the game's bosses again going through a short area based on the boss's home level.|$|E
5|$|The typical hunting {{strategy}} of the diamond stingray is to cruise just above the sea floor, landing atop any prey encountered. It then quickly levers its body up-and-down with its disc, producing negative pressure to extract the prey from its burrow. This ray has also been known to excavate large pits by undulating its disc <b>and</b> <b>spitting</b> jets of water, so as to uncover buried prey. Diamond stingrays are frequently trailed by smaller fishes, including Mexican hogfish (Bodianus diplotaenia), Galapagos porgies (Calamus taurinus), greybar grunts (Haemulon sexfasciatum), spinster wrasses (Halichoeres nichols), and long-spine porcupinefish (Diodon holocanthus), which {{take advantage of the}} invertebrates stirred up by the ray's activities. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium bullardi, A. dasi, A. rajivi, and A. soberoni, Anthocephalum currani, Parachristianella tiygonis, and Pseudochristianello elegantissima, the flukes Anaporrhutum euzeti and Probolitrema mexicana, and the monogenean Listrocephalos kearni.|$|E
25|$|Though Young {{encouraged}} Mormons {{to follow}} the Word of Wisdom code, the church was tolerant {{of those who did}} not follow it. In 1860, he counseled those chewing tobacco in church meetings to at least be discreet and not excessive, but did not charge users with sin. By 1870, however, he ended the practice of chewing <b>and</b> <b>spitting</b> tobacco in the Salt Lake Tabernacle.|$|E
40|$|Stability of the Cost Performance Index (CPI) and Schedule Performance Index (SPI(t)) {{refers to}} the moment in the project life cycle at which the CPI <b>and</b> <b>SPI(t)</b> are {{accurate}} <b>and</b> constant. For a project manager a reliable CPI <b>and</b> <b>SPI(t)</b> is essential for taking corrective actions in time to keep the project on budget, planning and scope. The focus of this paper lies on identifying project characteristics which infl uence this moment of CPI <b>and</b> <b>SPI(t)</b> in the project life cycle. Both existing theories from earlier academic research and newly identifi ed project characteristics are tested by using empirical data from nine projects executed by an engineering and consultancy company in the Netherlands. It is found that some project characteristics infl uence the moment of CPI <b>and</b> <b>SPI(t)</b> in the project lifecycle whereas other do not. The results of this paper contribute {{to the body of}} knowledge on EVM and might provide valuable information to project managers who consider to use EVM in their projects. The results of this research also point out new areas to explore the understanding of the stability of CPI <b>and</b> <b>SPI(t)</b> ...|$|R

25|$|On the Filipino side, {{information}} regarding atrocities {{comes from the}} eyewitnesses and the participants themselves. In his History of the Filipino People Teodoro Agoncillo writes that the Filipino troops could match and even exceed American brutality on some prisoners of war. Kicking, slapping, <b>and</b> <b>spitting</b> at faces were common. In some cases, ears and noses were cut off and salt applied to the wounds. In other cases, captives were buried alive. These atrocities occurred regardless of Aguinaldo's orders and circulars concerning the good treatment of prisoners.|$|E
25|$|The pneumonic form of plague {{arises from}} {{infection}} of the lungs. It causes coughing and sneezing and thereby produces airborne droplets that contain bacterial cells {{and are likely to}} infect anyone inhaling them. The incubation period for pneumonic plague is short, usually two to four days, but sometimes just a few hours. The initial signs are indistinguishable from several other respiratory illnesses; they include headache, weakness, <b>and</b> <b>spitting</b> or vomiting of blood. The course of the disease is rapid; unless diagnosed and treated soon enough, typically within a few hours, death may follow in one to six days; in untreated cases mortality is nearly 100%.|$|E
25|$|There {{were five}} initial charges lodged against the Templars. The first was {{renunciation}} of <b>and</b> <b>spitting</b> {{on the cross}} during initiation into the Order. The second was the stripping of the man to be initiated and the thrice kissing of that man by the preceptor on the navel, posterior and mouth. The third was telling the neophyte (novice) that unnatural lust was lawful and indulged in commonly. The fourth was that the cord worn by the neophyte day and night was consecrated by wrapping it around an idol {{in the form of}} a human head with a great beard, and that this idol was adored in all chapters. The fifth was that the priests of the order did not consecrate the host in celebrating Mass. Subsequently, the charges would be increased and would become, according to the procedures, lists of articles 86 to 127 in which will be added a few other charges, such as the prohibition to priests who do not belong to the order.|$|E

25|$|After {{a lengthy}} quest {{involving}} library research, rigged gambling, theft, drinking contests, necromancy, monkeys <b>and</b> <b>spitting,</b> Guybrush {{is able to}} recover all four fragments of the map. He gives the map to Wally the cartographer {{so that it can}} be deciphered, but both Wally and the map are captured by LeChuck. Guybrush stows away in a crate of voodoo supplies which is delivered to LeChuck's fortress, and through yet more spitting to escape from the torture chamber, and an accident involving a match and a large quantity of explosives, he and Wally are able to escape, although without recovering the map. Literally landing on Dinky Island, Guybrush encounters Herman Toothrot, who claims to be teaching zen philosophy on the beach. Herman is typically unhelpful, but his parrot remembers the conversation between the sailors who originally discovered Big Whoop and guides Guybrush to the treasure's burial site in exchange for crackers. Guybrush excavates the site and lowers himself into the hole on a rope. Elaine Marley, in her home on Booty Island, hears the explosion and correctly deduces that someone is attempting to dig up Big Whoop.|$|E

The idea behind the vignettes was that Fertig was {{to be part of}} a 'vampire' faction with Gangrel and Ariel; however, the faction did not materialise on television. The vignettes later expanded to include Ariel as a tarot card reader.|$|E

500|$|Chelsea {{survived the}} pressure, as Tevez failed {{to connect with}} a low cross from Rooney, and {{equalised}} {{in the final minute}} of the first half. The goal followed from a long-range shot by Michael Essien, which deflected first off Nemanja Vidić and then Ferdinand. The ball's change in direction caused Van der Sar to lose his footing, leaving Lampard, who had made a run from deep, with a simple finish. In celebration, Lampard looked up and pointed to the sky with both hands in memory of his mother, Pat, who had died a month earlier. At {{the end of the first}} half, Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson confronted match referee Ľuboš Micheľ, [...] "jabbing out an angry finger <b>and</b> <b>spitting</b> out a few choice words".|$|E

The third match degenerated into a shambles as the Celtic players lost their composure and discipline. Six players were sent off – four from Celtic and two from Racing Club – with Racing scoring the only goal to win the cup in a match described by Reuters as a [...] "bar room brawl".|$|E

500|$|Breaking {{down the}} {{distance}} between performer and audience {{is central to the}} punk ethic. Fan participation at concerts is thus important; during the movement's first heyday, it was often provoked in an adversarial manner—apparently perverse, but appropriately [...] "punk". First-wave British punk bands such as the Sex Pistols and the Damned insulted and otherwise goaded the audience into intense reactions. Laing has identified three primary forms of audience physical response to goading: can throwing, stage invasion, <b>and</b> <b>spitting</b> or [...] "gobbing". In the hardcore realm, stage invasion is often a prelude to stage diving. In addition to the numerous fans who have started or joined punk bands, audience members also become important participants via the scene's many amateur-written and informally distributed periodicals—in England, according to Laing, punk [...] "was the first musical genre to spawn fanzines in any significant numbers".|$|E
500|$|In May 1846, {{the family}} (Poe, Virginia, and her mother, Maria) {{moved to a}} small cottage in Fordham, about {{fourteen}} miles outside the city, a home which is still standing today. In what is the only surviving letter from Poe to Virginia, dated June 12, 1846, he urged her to remain optimistic: [...] "Keep up your heart in all hopelessness, and trust yet a little longer." [...] Of his recent loss of the Broadway Journal, the only magazine Poe ever owned, he said, [...] "I should have lost my courage but for youmy darling little wife you are my greatest and only stimulus now to battle with this uncongenial, unsatisfactory and ungrateful life." [...] But by November of that year, Virginia's condition was hopeless. Her symptoms included irregular appetite, flushed cheeks, unstable pulse, night sweats, high fever, sudden chills, shortness of breath, chest pains, coughing <b>and</b> <b>spitting</b> up blood.|$|E
500|$|The Never Ending Tour {{commenced}} on June 7, 1988, and Dylan {{has played}} roughly 100 dates {{a year for}} the entirety of the 1990s and 2000s—a heavier schedule than most performers who started out in the 1960s. By May 2013, Dylan and his band had played more than 2,500 shows, anchored by long-time bassist Tony Garnier, drummer George Recile, multi-instrumentalist Donnie Herron, and guitarist Charlie Sexton. To the dismay of some of his audience, Dylan's performances remain unpredictable as he alters his arrangements and changes his vocal approach night after night. Critical opinion about Dylan's shows remains divided. Critics such as Richard Williams and Andy Gill have argued that Dylan has found a successful way to present his rich legacy of material. Others have criticized his live performances for mangling <b>and</b> <b>spitting</b> out [...] "the greatest lyrics ever written so that they are effectively unrecognisable", and giving so little to the audience that [...] "it is difficult to understand what he is doing on stage at all." ...|$|E
