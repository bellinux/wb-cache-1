5|$|Operations in Borneo were {{extremely}} sensitive and they received little press coverage in Australia, while official acknowledgement {{of involvement in}} cross-border missions only occurred in 1996. Following <b>a</b> <b>military</b> <b>coup</b> in Indonesia in early 1966 which brought General Suharto to power, a peace treaty was signed in August 1966 which ended the conflict. 3,500 Australians served during Confrontation; casualties included 16 dead, with seven killed in action and eight wounded.|$|E
5|$|A new viceroy, Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, {{arrived in}} July to replace Liniers, and the independentist {{group did not}} agree on how to react. Castelli {{proposed}} a resumption of Álzaga's idea of creating a governing Junta, but not headed by the Spanish. Belgrano insisted on the plan to appoint Charlotte as regent of a constitutional monarchy, and Rodriguez Peña proposed <b>a</b> <b>military</b> <b>coup,</b> with or without Liniers at the head. They finally accepted the perspective of Cornelio Saavedra, and delayed taking action until a better opportunity.|$|E

25|$|From {{the mid to}} late 19th century, Guatemala {{experienced}} chronic {{instability and}} civil strife. Beginning in the early 20th century, it was ruled by a series of dictators backed by the United Fruit Company and the United States government. In 1944, authoritarian leader Jorge Ubico was overthrown by <b>a</b> pro-democratic <b>military</b> <b>coup,</b> initiating <b>a</b> decade-long revolution that led to sweeping social and economic reforms. <b>A</b> U.S.-backed <b>military</b> <b>coup</b> in 1954 ended the revolution and installed a dictatorship.|$|R
5|$|During David Dacko's {{presidency}} from 1960 to 1966, {{there was}} {{a significant increase in the}} production of diamonds. This occurred when the monopoly of the French concessionary companies was ended with a law allowing local citizens to dig for diamonds. After Dacko set up a diamond cutting factory at Bangui, diamonds became the country's leading export. But by the end of his five year's tenure, rampant corruption and financial indiscipline had resulted in workers being left unpaid and civil unrest ensued. Bokassa then seized power in <b>a</b> <b>military</b> <b>coup</b> in 1966.|$|E
5|$|In 1931 Berni {{returned}} to Rosario where he briefly {{lived on a}} farm and was then hired as a municipal employee. The Argentina of the 1930s {{was very different from}} the Paris of the 1920s. He witnessed labor demonstrations and the miserable effects of unemployment and was shocked by the news of <b>a</b> <b>military</b> <b>coup</b> d'état in Buenos Aires (see Infamous Decade). Surrealism didn't convey the frustration or hopelessness of the Argentine people. Berni organized Mutualidad de Estudiantes y Artistas and {{became a member of the}} local Communist party.|$|E

Roosevelt, with Butler selected to lead a march of veterans to become dictator, similar to other Fascist regimes at that time. The individuals involved all denied the existence of a plot and the media ridiculed the allegations.

5|$|In August, several Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) generals {{proposed}} {{the imposition of}} martial law, ostensibly {{to break up the}} demonstrations, but in reality to prepare for <b>a</b> <b>military</b> <b>coup.</b> However, Nhu, already looking to arrest Buddhist leaders and crush the protest movement, used the opportunity to preempt the generals and embarrass them. He disguised Tung's Special Forces in army uniforms and used them to attack the Buddhists, thereby causing the general public and South Vietnam's U.S. allies to blame the army, diminishing the generals' reputations and ability to act as future national leaders.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Mendenhall, {{a senior}} Vietnam adviser in the US State Department, {{advocated}} {{the removal of}} Diệm in <b>a</b> <b>military</b> <b>coup</b> and his replacement with Thơ. Thơ was privately {{aware that he was}} the choice of the generals to run the government after the planned overthrow of Diệm. By this time, Diệm and Nhu realized a plot was afoot against them, but did not know that General Tôn Thất Đính, a palace favourite was involved. Nhu ordered Đính and Colonel Lê Quang Tung, the ARVN Special Forces commander, to plan a fake coup against the Ngô family.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October 1969, while {{paying a}} visit to the {{northern}} town of Las Anod, Somalia's then President Abdirashid Ali Shermarke was assassinated by one of his own bodyguards. His assassination was quickly followed by <b>a</b> <b>military</b> <b>coup</b> d'état on 21 October 1969 (the day after his funeral), in which the Somali Army seized power without encountering armed opposition— essentially a bloodless takeover. The putsch was spearheaded by Major General Mohamed Siad Barre, who at the time commanded the army.|$|E
50|$|However, {{with great}} accomplishment, ambition, and followers' loyalties and supports, Zhao Kuangyin {{eventually}} replaced Guo Zongxun during <b>a</b> peaceful <b>military</b> <b>coup,</b> {{and became the}} emperor of a new dynasty, the Song dynasty. Through years of effort, Zhao Kuangyin conquered other rival states {{in the south and}} unified them under his newly established Song Empire. In order to prevent <b>a</b> similar <b>military</b> <b>coup</b> from happening again and to strengthen civilian control over the military, Zhao Kuangyin dismissed his generals and sent them home. This inadvertently resulted in the Song Empire having <b>a</b> weak <b>military</b> later.|$|R

A general mobilisation was not initiated by the new government until 3 April 1941, out of fear of offending Hitler and thus precipitating war. However, on the same day as the coup, Hitler issued Führer Directive 25 which called for Yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state, and on 3 April, Führer Directive 26 was issued, detailing the plan of attack and command structure for the German-led Axis invasion.|$|E

5|$|Apparently formidable, the Libyan {{military}} disposition in Chad was {{marred by}} serious flaws. The Libyans were prepared for a war {{in which they would}} provide ground and air support to their Chadian allies, act as assault infantry, and provide reconnaissance. By 1987, however, Muammar Gaddafi had lost his allies, exposing Libya's inadequate knowledge of the area. Libyan garrisons came to resemble isolated and vulnerable islands in the Chadian Sahara. Also important was the low morale among the troops, who were fighting in a foreign country, and the structural disorganization of the Libyan army, which was in part induced by Gaddafi's fear of <b>a</b> <b>military</b> <b>coup</b> against him. This fear led him to avoid the professionalization of the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Charles's only {{recourse}} was {{to return}} to negotiations, which were held at Newport on the Isle of Wight. On 5 December 1648, Parliament voted by 129 to 83 to continue negotiating with the king, but Oliver Cromwell and the army opposed any further talks with someone they viewed as a bloody tyrant and were already taking action to consolidate their power. Hammond was replaced as Governor of the Isle of Wight on 27 November, {{and placed in the}} custody of the army the following day. In Pride's Purge on 6 and 7 December, the members of Parliament out of sympathy with the military were arrested or excluded by Colonel Thomas Pride, while others stayed away voluntarily. The remaining members formed the Rump Parliament. It was effectively <b>a</b> <b>military</b> <b>coup.</b>|$|E
