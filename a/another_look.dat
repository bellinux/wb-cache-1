25|$|Thomas bowled over 63,000 balls for Northamptonshire, and {{opposing}} batsmen scored {{off of the}} Welsh medium-pacer at {{an average}} of just under two runs an over. It was his control that was a significant feature of the clubs bowling attack following the First World War. Furthermore, his approach to life mirrored his approach to cricket; sound, level-headed and a calming influence on some of his more temperamental colleagues. Billeted in Northampton during the war years, Thomas had attracted the attention of groundsman Alf Stockwin when he came to bowl in the nets at Wantage Road. His debut, against the Australian Imperial Forces side in 1919, was not a great success, but Northampton Grammar School took him on as groundsman and coach, giving Northamptonshire the opportunity to keep tabs on him. They decided to take <b>another</b> <b>look</b> and he justified their interest with 9-30 against Yorkshire at Bradford in 1920 with the last seven wickets only costing him six runs, and one lifting ball hit wicketkeeper Walter Buswell in the eye and put him out of the match. Only 'Bumper' Wells' dismissal of Roy Kilner prevented the county's first 'all-ten'.|$|E

25|$|I {{have been}} a Catholic and an infidel; I {{have been a}} Roman priest and a hypocrite; I have been a profligate under a cowl. I am that Father Achilli, who as early as 1826, was {{deprived}} of my faculty to lecture, for an offence which my superiors {{did their best to}} conceal; and who in 1827 had already earned the reputation of a scandalous friar. I am that Achilli, who in the diocese of Viterbo in February, 1831, robbed of her honour a young women of eighteen; who in September 1833, was found guilty of a second such crime, {{in the case of a}} person of twenty-eight; and who perpetrated a third in July, 1834, in the case of another aged twenty-four. I am he, who afterwards was found guilty of sins, similar or worse, in other towns of the neighbourhood. I am that son of St. Dominic who is known to have repeated the offence at Capua, in 1834 or 1835; and at Naples again, in 1840, in the case of a child of fiteen. I am he who chose the sacristy of the church for one of these crimes, and Good Friday for <b>another.</b> <b>Look</b> on me, ye mothers of England, a confessor against Popery, for ye 'ne'er may look upon my like again.' I am that veritable priest, who, after all this, began to speak against, not only the Catholic faith, but the moral law, and perverted others by my teaching. I am the Cavaliere Achilli, who then went to Corfu, made the wife of a tailor faithless to her husband, and lived publicly and travelled about with the wife of a chorus-singer. I am that Professor of the Protestant College at Malta, who with two others was dismissed from my post for offences which the authorities cannot get themselves to describe. And now attend to me, such as I am, and you shall see what you shall see about the barbarity and profligacy of the Inquisitors of Rome.|$|E
25|$|Australia weren't able {{to equal}} that feat despite another Anzac Test win in 2014. Later that year, Australia co-hosted the 2014 Four Nations with New Zealand. They {{took on the}} Kiwis in {{the second of the}} double-header clashes at Suncorp Stadium. However Australia's record against the Kiwis at the venue {{continued}} to be a negative one after another defeat made it three defeats in the past four meetings at the 'Cauldron'. This meant Australia were facing England in a must win game at AAMI Park in Melbourne. With many regulars missing, Sheens had to make decisions like naming an 18-year old in the team, who'd become the youngest player to play for Australia. Sione Mata'utia, aged 18 years and 129 days, eclipsed the previous record held by Israel Folau, since 2007, by 65 days when he played on debut for Australia against the 'Poms'. The match was headlined with controversy. In the last minute of the game, England put a grubber kick in the in-goal area, since they were desperate for a try as they were trailing by just four points. Australian fullback Greg Inglis had to force the ball dead due to incoming England attack but the video referees wanted to have <b>another</b> <b>look</b> and see {{whether or not it was}} Inglis or the incoming English winger Ryan Hall got the last touch on the ball. On the slow-motion replays it showed that Ryan Hall's right hand's little finger had put some downward pressure on the ball however in normal speed it was deemed 'inconclusive' by Australian officiating rules and therefore a NO TRY was given to the frustration of the English players and supporters but respect from Sheens and his Australian players. Had the try been awarded and England converted, it would have been Australia's first defeat to England since 1995, the first time they suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1970 and the first time they failed to qualify for a tournament final since 1954. In their final round-robin fixture they dominated proceedings against the Samoans, who had been causing trouble for England and New Zealand in the tournament, to advance to the final which was held in New Zealand. However they couldn't get revenge for their defeat earlier in the tournament as Australia lost 18â€“22.|$|E

500|$|Allusions to the {{painting}} were common in vaudeville acts, becoming stock gags in the Orpheum Circuit. Stage imitations of {{the painting}} were also created. In 1913, for instance, Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr. cast Ann Pennington as the model {{as part of his}} Follies. In this successful version of September Morn, the subject bore a sheer cape, with leaves placed strategically over her body, and stood on a stage made-up as water.

The court also pointed out that even if actions such as showing Thomas photographs of his family and letters from them could not be said to be deliberately improper, as the trial judge seemed to indicate would be necessary to characterise them as inducements, there was no way that they could be interpreted by someone in Thomas' position, other than as indications that if he cooperated he would be reunited with his family.

500|$|After leaving college, Oppong {{took part}} in the draft combine for the newly-formed National Basketball League of Canada (NBL) in August 2011.

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 15, 1910.

That night, after her granddad has fallen asleep, she slips out to have <b>another</b> <b>look</b> at the doll. Arriving at the toy shop, she sees that the doll is gone. Unseen by anyone, she enters the store. She finds the wonderful doll and lifts it out of its box to admire it. Hearing a clerk approaching, she becomes frightened and gets into the doll box. The doll rolls under the counter. The clerk sends the errand boy off with the box, thinking it contains the doll, which has been ordered for Daisy Smythe, a rich little girl. Arriving at Daisy's house, Marie {{steps out of the}} box as soon as the room is empty. She removes the doll clothes from the box and admires them greatly. She decides to try them on, and soon a little cap, shoes and garments are on her figure. Then she hears Daisy coming and retreats to the box. Daisy enters and takes the supposed doll from the box, falls in love with it instantly and enthusiastically works its arms and limbs. Marie lives up to her role well, imitating with stiff, jerky movements of the limbs that belong to real dolls. Then Daisy eats, and Marie grows hungry as she watches. When Daisy sets down her bowl of milk, Marie reaches over and drinks it down. Daisy is amazed when she misses the milk. Marie helps herself to all the food and Daisy's wonderment is amusing to see. Finally Daisy falls asleep in her chair and Marie falls asleep on the floor. Here she is found by her granddad, who managed to trace her from the toy shop, and Daisy and her mother laugh so heartily over Marie's adventure that they reward her cleverness with - the doll itself!" ...|$|E
500|$|Hewett {{began the}} 1893 season in good form, {{reaching}} his half-century {{in each of}} his first three matches for the county, including a total of 94 against Oxford University in late May. Hewett missed most of the match against Kent shortly after, returning to Taunton due to the death of his brother-in-law, during which time George Wood replaced him as a substitute. In July 1893, the touring Australians played Somerset at Taunton {{for the first time since}} 1882, when both the ground and the county team were barely established. After the success of the 1892 season, and because talented, Australian-born Sammy Woods was playing for Somerset, the match was eagerly anticipated. Thousands arrived in Taunton for the match, but after overnight torrential rain, the umpires inspected the pitch at 11:00 and abandoned play for the day. In his history of the county club, Roebuck suggest that they may have been put under pressure by the Australians or by Hewett himself. The Somerset fans and members were angry at the decision, but the Australians packed picnic baskets and after exchanging strong words with the locals, departed for the Quantock Hills. Hewett, along with Woods and Vernon Hill, arranged to play golf in Minehead. The crowd continued to show their dismay at the decision, and eventually the Somerset officials asked the umpires to take <b>another</b> <b>look</b> at the ground. Woods supported this decision in his reminiscences, claiming that [...] "the decision not to play was premature." [...] At 14:00, after their second inspection, the umpires retracted their previous decision and announced that play could start. Hewett reacted angrily, and argued unsuccessfully against the decision with the Somerset committee. The Australian players were recalled from their picnic, and play began at 16:00, although neither team particularly wanted to play. Roebuck recorded that [...] "Hewett, in particular, was in high dudgeon and... he threw away his wicket for 12 runs, having been dropped once." [...] David Foot offered a more tempered opinion, saying simply that Hewett's [...] "mind wasn't on the game." [...] No play was possible on the second day, and on the third, Australia won the match by six wickets. Hewett felt let down by the Somerset committee, who he felt had undermined his authority, prompting him to say that [...] "if a captain can't lead at Taunton, this is no place for him." [...] Although friends thought he was overreacting, he declared that he would resign from the captaincy and the club at the end of the season. Both Foot and Roebuck suggested that Hewett reacted in an over-sensitive and extreme manner, but that his lack of self-control may have limited his long-term captaincy prospects.|$|E
