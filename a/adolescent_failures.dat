40|$|The {{high school}} to college {{transition}} may be especially influential in creating feelings of social loneliness in <b>adolescents.</b> <b>Failure</b> to establish social structures may lead to feelings of loneliness and an increased need for social approval from their peers in the new environment. It was therefore predicted that the more lonely a student is, the more likely he/she would look for approval from others and the more likely he/she would acquiesce to a decision to participate in unethical actions proposed by peers. This prediction was tested {{in a sample of}} 158 female and 133 male college students. The evidence suggests that participants who were the most lonely were most likely to report a willingness to engage in unethical behaviors when encouraged by others. However, contrary to expectations, the need for approval did not mediate the relationship between loneliness and unethical behavior.

Methods: A case-control study involving 126 adolescents (15 to 19 years), in final puberty maturation being 76 eutrophic and 50 with failure to thrive (genetic or constitutional delay of growth), of matching ages, gender and pubertal maturation. The weight, height and calculated Z score for height/age and body mass index; bone mineral content, bone mineral density and adjusted bone mineral density were established for total body, lower back and femur; total fat-free mass and height-adjusted fat-free mass index, total fat mass and height-adjusted. The {{statistical analyses were performed}} using the Student’s t-test (weight, height and body composition); Mann-Whitney test (bone mass) and multiple linear regression (bone mass determinants).

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} if adolescents with LI are at increased risk relative to unimpaired peers at struggling to comprehend driving-related vocabulary found in driving preparation material. Method: This study included 11 adolescents with LI and 11 adolescent controls with typical language development. Participants completed a self-developed receptive vocabulary measure, the Driving-Related Picture Vocabulary Task, which consisted of simple noun, compound noun, and simple verb driving terminology. Results: The Driving-Related Picture Vocabulary Task was found to have strong convergent validity with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test—Fourth Edition (Dunn 2 ̆ 6 Dunn, 2007). Strong positive correlation was also found between accuracy on the Driving-Related Picture Vocabulary Task and overall oral language skills in adolescents. The LI group understood fewer driving-related terms compared to TD peers. Adolescents with LI and TD peers were found to have similar scores on the experimental task for understanding simple nouns. However, accuracy in adolescents with LI was found to be lower and statistically significant compared to the control participants in understanding simple verbs and compound nouns, for both noun + noun and adjective + noun compounds. Discussion: Decreased understanding of terms found in the Driver’s Manual puts adolescents with LI at risk for failing to earn a driver’s license, a major rite of passage for <b>adolescents.</b> <b>Failure</b> to comprehend driving terminology may also pose additional safety risks if these adolescents are unable to understand important rules, regulations, and practices for safe driving because of the challenging terminology used to describe them...|$|R

The investigation follows both teacher researcher and students during {{the emergence of a}} transactional curriculum that closely followed the Indian Nations at Risk Task Force recommendations for Native American learners. The study enlisted 20 Native American students who were already participating in the Upward Bound program. This program was chosen {{because it was the only}} such program in the United States exclusively for Native American students. These students attended public high schools in Tucson, Arizona, or high schools on the Tohono O'odham reservation outside Tucson. The curriculum focus is on transactional literacy experiences and inquiry. These focuses and the concept of teacher as researcher provide the theoretical framework. This framework illuminates curriculum as it attempts to transform the educational experiences of Native American adolescents immersed in writing experiences rooted in Native American ways of viewing the world. This analysis of one distinctive writing class suggests that the often documented institutionally-produced factors that contribute to Native American <b>adolescent</b> <b>failure</b> and discontinuity in secondary writing settings can be overcome when Native American culture is not only valued, but embraced as the focus of literacy in school. This dissertation provides insights into the uniqueness of Native American school experiences and extends the current body of literature on Native American education by considering culture as the invitation into literacy and the teacher as change agent. This study also asks others to pick up the torch. Finally, teacher researcher generated recommendations provide an opportunity for teachers themselves to begin the process of changing the discontinuity of learning often felt by Native Americans in their own classrooms. These recommendations include five conditions for an emerging curriculum: (a) creating space for transactional dialogues, (b) sharing responsibility, (c) trusting inquiry, (d) using multiple sign systems, and (e) accessing personal and social ways of knowing. We need not wait for institutional change to make a difference. As has often been stated in educational research, the teacher makes the difference...|$|R

It is arranged in four sections, further subdivided into nine chapters. Section one contains an outline of the main aims, scope, and the significance and limitations of the study. Information about the UAE and some historical background of the society before and after federation are provided to show the rapid and comprehensive development which has been influencial: social structure, familial changes, and changes in traditional customs. The possible effects upon adolescence in the community are discussed. Section two provides a review of relevant literature. Firstly, the concept of needs, historical background of studies of needs, influences upon the development of needs hierarchies, approaches to the study adolescents' needs, universal needs of adolescence and major issues in the assessment of needs are outlined. Then, definitions, conceptual and methodological issues and theories of coping which have influenced this study are discussed. Differences in coping styles and processes used in response to specific and dispositional needs arousal are considered. The development of adolescent perceptions of needs, the significance of <b>adolescent</b> <b>failure</b> in developing coping skills and cognitive development and its effects upon the perception of needs are examined. Finally, the researcher presents a framework of needs perception and coping responses which is used in the design and the conduct of the empirical study. Section three describes the empirical work of the study. It is in three chapters. Firstly, the aims and the overall design are described. A pilot study involving qualitative and quantitative measures was undertaken in preparation for the design and use of a questionnaire involving a larger sample of adolescents. The main study which involved the construction of a questionnaire to examine adolescents' perceived needs and the coping responses. Responses from 700 young people in the UAE were analyzed to determine types and strengths of perceived needs and differences in coping responses. Some gender differences were also identified and discussed. Section four contains a summary of the main findings, conclusions and recommendations. The three most strongly perceived needs reported by these young people were: to achieve success, to be blessed by God and to feel homeostasis and away from problems; and the least strongly felt needs were: to be beautiful/handsome and to gain people's attention. Some gender differences were noted. In coping responses the findings indicated that boys tend to use denial way of coping to meet their perceived needs more than girls, who tend to use acceptance way of coping more than boys. Interestingly, the findings of this research show a considerable overlap between the perceived needs of adolescents in an Islamic culture and those of adolescents in western cultures. The findings are discussed in relation to the debate in theoretical terms between perception of human behavior as trait-orientated or process-orientated. This section concludes with a discussion of issues and questions raised in the study and with recommendations for further research...|$|R

Tooth erosion has been reported as an oral manifestation that might help in the early detection of eating disorders. Objectives: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to search for scientific evidence regarding the following clinical question: Do eating disorders increase the risk of tooth erosion? Methods: An electronic search addressing eating disorders and tooth erosion was conducted in eight databases. Two independent reviewers selected studies, abstracted information and assessed its quality. Data were abstracted for meta-analysis comparing tooth erosion in control patients (without eating disorders) vs. patients with eating disorders; and patients with eating disorder risk behavior vs. patients without such risk behavior. Combined odds ratios (ORs) and a 95 % confidence interval (CI) were obtained. Results: Twenty-three papers were included in the qualitative synthesis and assessed by {{a modified version of the}} Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Fourteen papers were included in the meta-analysis. Patients with eating disorders had more risk of tooth erosion (OR = 12. 4, 95 %CI = 4. 1 – 37. 5).

40|$|Endocrine {{disorders}} in <b>adolescents</b> with renal <b>failure</b> commonly increase {{the difficulties of}} transition to adulthood. Puberty is frequently delayed and close with an abbreviated growth spurt contributing to late and insufficient growth. In addition several parameters impair the gain of a normal final height such as malnutrition, reduced function of growth hormone and IGF-I receptor and renal osteopathy. Malnutrition and inadequate body shape may be aggravated by the dysregulation of endocrine regulators of appetite and energy consumption such as leptin and ghrelin. The proper treatment of growth impairment includes the exclusion of causes not associated with renal failure and the consideration of all underlying conditions. Treatment with recombinant human growth hormone has recently been shown to effectively increase final height. In contrast, no successful treatment options have been suggested for the correction of pubertal disorders due to renal failure. However, disorders with primary gonadal insufficiency have to be carefully ruled out.

The {{purpose of this study is}} to use longitudinal, population-based data to report national-level hospital metrics, providing a current assessment of the status of sepsis hospitalizations in Canadian children. Methods: We performed an analysis of previously abstracted data from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) Discharge Abstract Database (DAD). Children aged 0 – 17 years at the time of hospital admission were identified from a cohort of patients with sepsis or severe sepsis using the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10 th Revision (ICD- 10 -CA) and the Canadian Classification of Health Interventions (CCI). Descriptive population-based statistics are reported. Results: Hospitalization data for 20, 130 children admitted over 5 years were reviewed. The majority of children were young, with neonates (56. 3 %) and infants under 2 months (18. 8 %) representing the majority of cases. A decline in age-adjusted hospitalization rates was demonstrated in both overall and non-severe sepsis across the study period; however, no change was demonstrated for severe sepsis. While overall in-hospital crude mortality rates did not change significantly across the study period (range 5. 1 %– 5. 4 %), a significant decrease was found in children aged 3 – 23 months and <b>adolescents.</b> Multi-organ <b>failure</b> was reported in more than one-quarter of children with severe sepsis. Odds of mortality increased significantly with number of organs failed. Conclusion: Sepsis remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in Canadian children, posing a significant burden on health care resources. Age continues to be associated with the incidence and severity of illness. Overall hospitalization rates have declined over time, as has mortality in severe sepsis. This report provides baseline metrics for future outcome-based research in Canada targeting prevention strategies and early diagnosis, as well as therapies preventing and managing organ failure.

Due to the specific immunity status of children and <b>adolescents</b> with renal <b>failure,</b> possible exposure to other cross-reactive allergens specially pollen and trees, their exposure to frequent hemodialysis and use of gloves, catheters and other equipment containing latex, {{this study was designed}} aiming at determining the prevalence of latex allergy in hemodialyzed children and adolescents under 18 years old in hospitals of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences - 2006. Material and Methods:In this descriptive cross-sectional study, reaction of 68 participants to scratch skin test (Prick) with standard latex extract, previous history about sensitivity and their demographic data were analyzed by SPSS, version 11 software using descriptive and inferential statistic such as proportion test, independent t-test and Chi-square. Results:The findings revealed that one of the seven subjects (14. 7 %) had positive reaction to latex. Proportion test indicated that this prevalence rate was higher than the normal population sensitivity rate (P = 0 / 001). Conclusion:With respect to the results, researchers suggest that exact history taking and the necessary latex allergy tests should be performed in this high risk group to prevent damage and possible side effects. Also, to reduce the sensitivity of latex, we recommend that protein component of the gloves, the catheter and other equipment used containing latex be decreased by Chlorination, Autoclaving and use of Proteolytic enzymes or Nonionic surfactants such as Polyethylene glycol...|$|R

Methods: The study was based on patient interviews to administer 2 adherence questionnaires. The medical charts were reviewed for {{the record of the}} latest CD 4 counts, viral load, and sociodemographic characteristics. Results: Thirty-two HIV-infected adolescents were enrolled in the study. Only 15 of 32 of them (47 %) claimed adherence greater than 95 %, whereas 26 of 32 (81 %) had a viral load less than 50 copies/mL. The adolescents with an undetectable viral load had a median adherence rate significantly higher than <b>adolescents</b> with virological <b>failure</b> (100 versus 83. 5 %; P=. 0. 01). Among the latter, 5 out of 6 patients acknowledged adherence less than 95 % versus 12 of 26 patients with an undetectable viral load. Having forgotten was the main reason reported for skipping medication doses. Fear of being seen while taking the pills differentiated adolescents with adherence less than 95 % from the others (79 versus 33 %; P=. 0. 01). Conclusion: The self-reported adherence rate evaluated by questionnaire was associated with control of the viremia. However, the significance of these rates and the thresholds used have to be interpreted taking into account the characteristics of the drugs as well as the patients' treatment history. The reasons for skipping treatment doses are related to the adolescent process and the representations that the adolescent has of his illness. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

To compare factors associated to substance misuse in adolescents with the available scientific literature and to suggest specific preventive interventions for a national policy in Brazil. METHODS: Eighty-six adolescent's guardians were evaluated at admission to the service by using a semistructured interview including sociodemographic data, family relationship, perinatal and pregnancy histories, psychomotor and educational development, social relations, history of previous illnesses and family diseases, including drug abuse. RESULTS: The sample was predominantly male (90 %). Adolescents referred from the criminal justice were older than those originating from other sources (16. 4 x 15. 4 years old p=. 00). Forty-four percent of <b>adolescents</b> reported school <b>failure,</b> a level which is two times higher than Brazilian statistics. Forty {{percent of the sample}} had criminal involvement, mainly drug dealing. Cannabis was the most prevalent reported drug.

Alcoholism and drug addiction in parents and relatives were about four times higher than those reported for the Brazilian population. No correlation was found between the investigated factors and adherence to treatment. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the programs must include treatment of adults and education of parents and parents to be. Withdrawal of treatment occurs in the first month, and seems to be related to factors extrinsic to the adolescent...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{number of}} HIV-infected {{children}} and adolescents requiring second-line antiretroviral treatment (ART) is increasing in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). However, the effectiveness of paediatric second-line ART and potential risk factors for virologic failure are poorly characterized. We performed an aggregate analysis of second-line ART outcomes for children and assessed the need for paediatric third-line ART. Methods: We performed a multicentre analysis by systematically reviewing the literature to identify cohorts of {{children and adolescents}} receiving second-line ART in LMIC, contacting the corresponding study groups and including patient-level data on virologic and clinical outcomes. Kaplan–Meier survival estimates and Cox proportional hazard models were used to describe cumulative rates and predictors of virologic failure. Virologic failure was defined as two consecutive viral load measurements > 1000 copies/ml after at least six months of second-line treatment. Results: We included 12 cohorts representing 928 children on second-line protease inhibitor (PI) -based ART in 14 countries in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. After 24  months, 16. 4 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 13. 9 – 19. 4) of children experienced virologic <b>failure.</b> <b>Adolescents</b> (10 – 18  years) had failure rates of 14. 5 (95 % CI 11. 9 – 17. 6) per 100 person-years compared to 4. 5 (95 % CI 3. 4 – 5. 8) for younger children (3 – 9  years). Risk factors for virologic failure were adolescence (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 3. 93, p  48  months, respectively, compared to < 24  months). Conclusions: In LMIC, paediatric PI-based second-line ART was associated with relatively low virologic <b>failure</b> rates. However, <b>adolescents</b> showed exceptionally poor virologic outcomes in LMIC, and optimizing their HIV care requires urgent attention. In addition, 16 % {{of children and adolescents}} failed PI-based treatment and will require integrase inhibitors to construct salvage regimens. These drugs are currently not available in LMIC...|$|R
40|$|Resilience is {{the ability}} to survive and persevere during {{difficult}} times. Resilient people also thrive after overcoming adversity. Adolescents have many developmental tasks to overcome in their quest to becoming adults. Difficulty with these tasks can lead to academic and personal <b>failures.</b> <b>Adolescents</b> with low resilience often struggle with low self-esteem. If students are identified early as having lower levels of resilience, professional school counselors have an opportunity to provide resilience-enhancing activities. Prior to middle school, students are assigned all of their classes. During middle school, students begin to select their elective courses which may be representative of their interests and current emotional status. By looking at students' elective courses, I looked for patterns of resilience that may help professional school counselors proactively identify students in need of additional guidance in order to be academically successful. This study utilized a convenience sample of middle school students enrolled in the 8 th grade (N = 190) of a large suburban school district located in the southwest United States to measure levels of resilience and elective course enrollment. Gender of the participants was 107 females and 83 males. The students reported their ethnicity as 5. 8 % African American/Black, 11. 1 % Asian, 12. 6 % Hispanic, 1. 1 % Native American, 1. 6 % Pacific Islander, 59. 5 % Caucasian/White, and 8. 4 % multiracial. I measured resilience in this study using the Resilience Scale and comparisons based on elective course. Data analyses include descriptive statistics and ANOVAs. Based on a statistical significance criterion of p <. 05, students enrolled in athletics scored significantly higher in resilience than did non-athletics students enrolled in physical education/outdoor education (p =. 035). Additionally, Caucasian females were significantly less resilient than Caucasian males (p =. 031). Limitations of the study, implications of the results for practice, and recommendations for future research are presented...|$|R
40|$|Danielle Osterholzer Ryan White Center for Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health, Division of Adult Infectious Diseases, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA Abstract: Pediatric {{patients}} {{infected with}} {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) are now living longer, healthier lives due to the advent of combined antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, including regimens that often contain non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). However, first-generation NNRTIs such as nevirapine (NVP) and efavirenz (EFV) have a low genetic barrier to resistance, and both drugs can become ineffective with a single viral point mutation. New agents with activity against resistant viral strains must be available to salvage children and <b>adolescents</b> with virologic <b>failure</b> after NNRTI use. One such drug, etravirine, an oral second-generation NNRTI approved {{for use in the}} US in heavily treatment-experienced HIV- 1 -infected adults in 2008, is accumulating data in this younger population. Etravirine became approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in early 2012 to be used in combination with other ARV medications in HIV- 1 -infected children aged 6 years to < 18 years who are failing their regimens with HIV- 1 strains resistant to NNRTIs and other ARVs. This approval was largely based on data from a prospective, open-label, phase II clinical trial in this age group prescribed etravirine at 5. 2 mg/kg twice daily (up to the adult dose of 200 mg twice daily) in combination with an investigator-selected optimized background regimen. Currently available 48 -week follow-up data show complete viral suppression (< 50 copies/mL) in 56 % of the patients, with relatively few serious adverse events attributed to the drug. Additional studies and case reports from the field suggest its utility in clinical practice. This review is designed to increase the background understanding of this drug in pediatric HIV providers, to lay out the current pediatric data to support its use, and to define its practical role in the treatment of HIV-infected children now and in the future.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{examined the relationship}} between adolescents 2 ̆ 7 attachment to their parents, ego development, individuation, and depressive and counter depressive symptomatology. It was hypothesized that positive attachment would correspond to greater progress toward individuation, less depressive and counterdepressive defenses, and {{that there would be a}} curvilinear relationship between attachment and ego development. ^ Dimensions of attachment measured by the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment included those of parental trust, communication, and alienation. Individuation, as well as three types of depression and three types of behavior related to counterdepressive styles, were measured by the Pace Profile of Adolescent Depression and Individuation. Ego development was measured by Jane Loevinger 2 ̆ 7 s Washington University Sentence Completion Test. ^ The sample was comprised of 263 adolescents, 118 males and 145 females, attending a Northern Westchester high school, ranging in age from 14 to 18 years old. Contrast analyses and correlational analyses demonstrated that there were no significant findings for hypotheses predicting a significant relationship between perceived attachment to mother or father and ego development stage. Follow up exploratory analyses examining gender interaction effects also yielded largely insignificant results, but for a significant relationship between ego development and alienation from the mother. For male adolescents, a significant relationship between ego development and attachment to the mother was found. ^ Correlational analyses demonstrated that there was a significant and positive relationship between attachment to parents and individuation (defined as PADI scales III and IV). High scores on the three scales of the PADI measuring types of depression (defined as PADI scales I, II, and VIII) and three scales measuring counterdepressive defenses (defined as PADI scales V, VI, and VII) to the individuation process were negatively related to attachment to mother and father for both the males and females. Multiple regression demonstrated that higher attachment to both parents combined to predict a statistically significant degree of the variance in individuation and that attachment to the mother was more highly predictive of successful individuation than attachment to father. Among the dimensions of attachment, trust was more predictive of individuation than were communication or alienation. ^ Results of this study should prove useful to psychologists, teachers, and others concerned with <b>adolescents</b> for whom <b>failure</b> of individuation and concomitant depressive anxieties and defenses against them impact their self-esteem and often their ability to cope effectively with stage specific demands. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: As {{access to}} and {{duration}} of antiretroviral therapy (ART) increase, {{the number of patients}} experiencing first-line ART failure, followed by the need for second-line treatment is rising. The availability of second-line ART drugs is, however, often insufficient in resource-limited settings. For this reason many patients remain on a failing first-line regimen instead of being given more efficient second-line treatment. The long-term consequences and outcomes of this practice in rural areas are uncertain. In rural Tanzania, we have therefore studied the clinical and immunological development of adults and <b>adolescents</b> after virological <b>failure,</b> both those remaining on first-line-, and those being switched to second-line ART. Methods: 44 adults (≥ 15 years) who had been on ART for at least six months and had a confirmed virological failure (HIV- 1 RNA ≥ 400 copies/mL) were included in the study. In the period December 2006 – September 2009, 27 patients (61 %), continued first-line ART, while 17 patients (39 %), changed to second-line ART because of a failing first-line regimen. Follow-up data was collected through February 2010. Data on clinical, immunological and virological outcomes for the two groups was compared and analysed by logistic regression analyses and paired samples T-tests. Results: At the time of virological failure the median viral load (VL) was 28 000 copies/mL (IQR 2630 - 149 000) and the mean CD 4 cell count was 321. 2 cells/µL, standard deviation (SD) 224. 88. At the same time samples from 33 patients were available for drug resistance testing, out of which 20 (60. 6 %) had detectable resistance. Six patients died following virological failure, but {{there was no significant difference}} in the odds of death between patients on first-line ART compared to those on second-line ART, Odds Ratio 0. 58; P = 0. 54. The mean changes in CD 4 cell count 6, 12 or 18 months after virological failure was - 28. 6, - 80. 5 and - 48. 3 cells/µL for those on first-line ART, while the mean changes was + 56. 2, + 83. 2 and + 90. 9 cells/µL for those on second-line ART. Conclusion: Patients who remained on a failing first-line regimen had a declining CD 4 cell count and were at risk of opportunistic infections and death. Patients who changed to second-line ART had an increasing CD 4 cell count. They were still at risk of opportunistic disease and death, which could be explained by late detection of virological failure. Improved access to VL monitoring and second-line ART could improve prognosis for HIV-infected patients in rural settings...|$|R
