40|$|I {{formulate}} {{a model to}} emphasize the fraud detection role of auditors in the financial market and relate the role to audit and financial reporting delays. The model focuses on <b>asset</b> <b>misappropriation</b> <b>fraud,</b> {{which is one of}} the two types of fraud US and international auditing standards require auditors to consider. In the model, an auditor considers whether to perform extended audit procedures after observing a red flag generated from regular audit procedures. An audit delay is represented by the event of extending audit procedures and manifested as a financial reporting delay observed by the market. I derive a simple closed-form condition characterizing when a positive market reaction to a delay is possible. The condition provides a theoretical basis for formulating empirically testable hypotheses. I discuss why the fundamental logic behind the counter-intuitive positive-reaction condition also applies to accounting fraud, as well as other contexts (e. g., internal control weakness disclosure). Documented evidence in the literature suggests that “positive reactions to bad news” (PR 2 BN) is a general phenomenon. Other empirical implications of the model, with suggestions for regression equation specifications, are also discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} governance, control and media {{patterns}} underlying financial reporting and <b>asset</b> <b>misappropriation</b> <b>frauds.</b> We {{argue that the}} fraud triangle framework (incentive, opportunity, rationalization) that underlies most prevention and detection practices provides a partial picture of the fraud landscape and does not pay enough attention to its dynamic nature. A missing ingredient is managerial hubris, fed by fawning media and financial market participants, which ignites and accelerates the fraud triangle. Hubris is characterized by exaggerated self-confidence, arrogance and oblivion to reality. Focusing on the population of financial frauds in Canadian publicly traded firms during the 1995 - 2005 period, we show that hubris, i. e., irrationality, may be a critical factor to understand corporate financial frauds. Our findings also suggest that fraud patterns may differ across countries, constrasting with the adoption of global auditing standards...|$|R

It has caused many banks to collapse, and many investors and depositors funds were trapped. In fact, it has prevented many banks from achieving their goals and many businesses went into liquidation. Since the last few decades, <b>asset</b> <b>misappropriation</b> is prevalent especially in financial service industry. In addition, employee fraud is the most prevalent type of fraud experienced by organizations. Therefore, {{the main purpose of}} this study is to provide a more in depth view on the reasons of assets perpetrations conducted by bank employees in Iran.

40|$|Fraud is {{a growing}} issue that {{organizations}} face. In the 2016 Report to the Nations, the ACFE estimated that organizations typically lose 5 % of revenues each year to fraud. This is an extremely large cut of revenues that most businesses cannot afford to lose. The ACFE reports that 30 % of fraud victims within their study was small businesses with less than 100 employees (2016). While the median loss per fraud case is the same at $ 150, 000 for for-profit organizations of any size, the frequency of fraud at small businesses {{is much higher than}} at large businesses (ACFE, 2016). Though $ 150, 000 may not seem like a big loss for a Fortune 500 company, this amount can be extremely damaging to a small business. A study by Carland et al., attributed the majority of small businesses failures to occupational fraud (2001). Small businesses are even further vulnerable due to several characteristics prevalent within small businesses that make them the most targeted form of business for fraud. The focus of this thesis is on best practices in internal controls to help prevent {{the most common form of}} occupational <b>fraud,</b> which is <b>asset</b> <b>misappropriation.</b> This form of fraud makes up 83 % of all cases reported to the ACFE (ACFE, 2016). While <b>asset</b> <b>misappropriation</b> has the smallest median loss compared that of financial statement fraud or corruption, the ACFE still found that the median loss per case is $ 125, 000. This may not present too large of a burden to larger organizations, however this loss affects smaller businesses quite differently. Thus, it is very important to identify the internal controls most suited to preventing fraud within a small business setting...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether {{anonymous}} reporting channels (ARCs) are effective in detecting fraud against companies.

The fraud triangle (incentives, opportunities and attitudes) provides a framework for developing our understanding of how ARCs can increase detection of fraud. Using publicly listed company survey data collected by KPMG in Australia—where ARCs are not mandated—we find a positive association between ARCs and reported fraud. These results indicate that ARCs are effective in detecting fraud. Additional analysis reveals that small firms derive the greatest benefit from adopting ARCs. We also find that independent boards do not directly influence the detection of fraud, but companies with independent boards detect more fraud because they implement ARCs...|$|R

This study narrows the area of interest to <b>asset</b> <b>misappropriation</b> {{as part of the}} Occupational Fraud and Abuse Classification System created by the Association of Fraud Examiners. An initial instrument to measure traits is developed and used to map decision paths that yield greater instances of reporting fraudulent behavior. Three hundred six responses from four national origins completed a survey instrument that measure the traits of Skepticism, Experience, and Judgement. After exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) a four factor model was deemed a good fit for the data. Using structural equation modeling analysis to replicate the decision making process the results indicate that all three traits are influential in an increase of reporting fraud. The Judgment trait had the strongest influence on the decision to report fraudulent behavior. Secondary analysis to test for variance of trust paths, as discussed by Rogers (2010), resulted in finding differences based on national culture. On the Rational-choice trust path, Low Secrecy Index participants had a stronger influence on the decision to report fraudulent behavior than High Secrecy Index participants. ...|$|R

The purpose of this research is to identify effective methods to fight <b>asset</b> <b>misappropriation,</b> in particular billing, payroll and expense reimbursement schemes, in Russian small businesses. This is achieved by answering the following research questions: What measures do fraud experts recommend to prevent and detect billing, payroll and expense reimbursement schemes? What measures do Russian small businesses have in place to prevent and detect billing, payroll and expense reimbursement schemes? How do managers and accountants estimate effectiveness of the measures in preventing and detecting billing, payroll and expense reimbursement schemes? The data used in this study was gathered carrying out an analysis of the content of recent fraud literature and conducting an e-mail survey. A total of 14 small business managers and accountants responded to the questionnaire (response rate 100 %). Because of non-random selection of the survey participants, there might be a difference between the results from the current study and the results from the entire population It was found that managers and accountants in small businesses believe the most effective fraud detection procedures are comparing purchase order with invoice and with shipping documents and confirming data with vendors/customers. They rate having restricted access to business records in organization as the most effective fraud prevention measure, while fraud detection training is viewed as the least effective measure.

Every human conduct, apart from the legal viewpoint, may also be assessed from the moral viewpoint, whereas in this context, law is designated as the "moral minimum". From this relationship, we arrive at the conclusion that every instance of unlawful conduct is also immoral. On the contrary, conduct that complies with the law always need not be {{in compliance with the}} moral norms. In the Czech Republic, the New Criminal Code came into force on 1 January 2010, which also punishes the most severe forms of unlawful conduct and fundamentally affects performance of the accounting and auditing professions. Apart from some concept changes, this Codex also introduced, for instance, changes in the punishability of planning crimes. From the viewpoint of the auditor, tax adviser and accountant, barring of perpetration, whose commitment or planning authentically comes to the knowledge of the auditor, tax adviser or accountant seems to be fundamental. The issues of occupational fraud are mainly related to the problems of the auditing profession. These unlawful acts take various forms, which can be split into three basic groups, which are <b>asset</b> <b>misappropriation,</b> fraudulent statements and corruption. When exposing occupational fraud, as well as other forms of unlawful conduct, confidentiality issues are fundamental. In some cases, the law anticipates breaking through this confidentiality, mainly, for the purpose of exposing the most severe forms of unlawful conduct. Within the framework of prevention of occupational fraud, internal control systems play an essential role.

Yet the international law governing this mechanism, which I refer to as ‘humanitarian financial intervention’, remains fragmented. This article offers the first systematic legal analysis of humanitarian financial intervention. It identifies six humanitarian purposes that states may pursue through asset freezes: preserving foreign <b>assets</b> from <b>misappropriation,</b> incapacitating foreign states or foreign nationals, coercing foreign states or foreign nationals to forsake abusive practices, compensating victims, ameliorating humanitarian crises through humanitarian aid or postconflict reconstruction, and punishing human rights violators. Whether intervening states may pursue these objectives in any given context depends upon the interplay between several international legal regimes, including international investment law, collective-security agreements such as the UN Charter, the customary law of countermeasures, the law of armed conflict, and customary law governing the enforcement of judicial decisions. By disentangling the various international legal regimes that govern humanitarian financial intervention, this article furnishes a preliminary road map for evaluating the legality of past, present, and future financial interventions – including asset freezes directed against the Qaddafi regime during the 2011 Libyan Revolution...|$|R

2500|$|In 1987, while {{negotiating}} {{his contract}} as a WWF commentator, Ventura waived his rights to royalties on videotape sales {{when he was}} falsely told that only feature performers received such royalties. In November 1991, having discovered that other non-feature performers received royalties, Ventura brought an action for <b>fraud,</b> <b>misappropriation</b> of publicity rights, and quantum meruit in Minnesota state court against Titan Sports asking {{for the amount of}} $2 million in royalties based on a fair market value share. Titan removed the case to federal court, and Ventura won a $801,333 jury verdict on the last claim. In addition the judge awarded him $8,625 in back pay for all non video wwf merchandising featuring Ventura. The judgment was affirmed on appeal, and the case, [...] 65 F.3d 725 (8th Cir.1995), is an important result in the law of restitution. As a result, Ventura's commentary is removed on most releases from WWE Home Video. At the time, Vince McMahon swore Ventura would never appear on any WWF program again.|$|R
