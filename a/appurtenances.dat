[...] In reply to this assertion, Burroughs wrote in [...] "Real and Sham Natural History": [...] "The crows do not train their young. They have no fortresses, or schools, or colleges, or examining boards, or diplomas, or medals of honor, or hospitals, or churches, or telephones, or postal deliveries, or anything of the sort.

2500|$|Two Nathaniel Popes {{lived in}} the same area around the year 1700, both grandsons of the {{original}} patentee. Nathaniel alias Bridges (through the early death of Nathaniel II) became an established Westmoreland attorney by 1705, and served as guardian of Nathaniel Washington in 1708. The mariner Nathaniel was first recorded as married in 1704.

A Pope family artifact unearthed at George Washington’s birthplace, a wine bottle seal marked [...] "N. Pope 1715," [...] probably belonged to Nathaniel alias Bridges.
