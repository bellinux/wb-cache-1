Two performance functions were defined based on maximum settlement and maximum change in longitudinal gradient given in Finnish guidelines. In the settlement calculation, both primary and secondary consolidation were considered. According to the results, uncertainty in gradient changes is more critical and also more challenging to assess compared to uncertainty in total settlement.

40|$|Maintenance {{logistics}} support {{is a significant}} challenge for extended human operations in space, especially for missions beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO). For missions to Mars (such as NASA's Evolvable Mars Campaign (EMC)), where timely resupply or abort {{in the event of}} emergency will not be possible, maintenance logistics mass is directly linked to the Probability of Loss of Crew (P(LoC)), and the cost of driving down risk is an exponential increase in mass requirements. The {{logistics support}} strategies that have maintained human operations in LEO will not be effective for these deep space missions. In-Space Manufacturing (ISM) is a promising technological solution that could reduce logistics requirements, mitigate risks, and augment operational capabilities, enabling Earth- independent human spaceflight. This paper reviews maintenance logistics challenges for spaceflight operations in LEO and beyond, and presents a summary of selected results from a systems analysis of potential ISM applications for the ISS and EMC.

40|$|Abstract: The {{analysis}} and the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> costs for technological equipment play a dominant role among maintenance management issues in industrial enterprises. An original {{approach to this}} problem {{is based on the}} non-maintenance costs which can be defined through the expenses caused by the non-maintenance of the functional characteristics of industrial technological equipment. Practically, the equipment inefficiency (non-maintenance) costs can be assessed by the difference between provisioned operation cost to be obtained in an ideal situation (according to which the equipment dose not undergo any breakdown) and the real situation of the results obtained in the same period. The assessment model for non- maintenance costs proposed in the paper involves the covering of the following stages: diagnosis, the definition of ideal situation, the evaluation of the results ' accounts and the calculation of the non-maintenance cost as such. Maintenance costs can be analyzed according to their nature, their destination and their type of intervention; these costs can be imputed to the operating method (of equipment, tools, technological mechanisms) and to the investment program. The {{analysis and}} the evaluation of the maintenance costs of functioning technologica...|$|E

Several sites where units have been requested however, notably Central Australia and Indonesia, have feed water which is marginal {{in terms of its}} ability to be treated by reverse osmosis without some form of pretreatment. Guidelines for feed water pretreatment generally apply to large scale commercial units which operate at high recovery ratios and thus have limited applicability to the Solarflow unit.

40|$|Accurate {{treatment}} of amide resonance {{is important in}} electronic structure calculation of protein, for Resonance-Assisted Hydrogen Bonding in the hydrogen bonded chains of backbone amides of protein secondary structures such as beta sheets and alpha helices is determined by amide resonance. Variation in amide resonance is {{the means by which}} the hydrogen bonding in these chains is cooperative. Amide carbonyl orbitals are revealed by Natural Bond Orbital, NBO, analysis to substantially maintain sigma/pi separation in the presence of torsional hyperconjugative interactions with wavefunction methods but not with established Density Functional Theory, DFT, methods. This DFT error is most pronounced with small basis sets such as are used with DFT for proteins to reduce the basis function count. This error disturbs calculation of a range of amide donor-acceptor and steric interactions. This finding has important implications for the selection of electronic structure methods and basis sets for protein calculations. For example, great caution is needed in interpreting the results of applying established DFT methods to proteins containing any beta sheets. We recommend that every protein DFT calculation be accompanied by NBO <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> of amide carbonyl sigma/pi separation and absence of carbonyl bond bending. Further, we propose that these metrics be standard benchmarks of electronic structure methods and basis sets...|$|E
40|$|Life-cycle {{management}} of urban infrastructure projects is very complex process from both management and economic aspects. Focus {{of this research}} is on urban infrastructure maintenance phase of a life-cycle, especially on decision making in maintenance problems. Urban infrastructure maintenance management deals with complex decision making process. The reasons for a complexity are: lots of participants, multi-disciplinarity, huge quantity of information, limited budget, conflict goals and criteria. These facts indicate that decision making processes in urban infrastructure management undoubtedly belong to ill-defined problems. In order to cope with such complexity and to help project managers during decision making processes this research proposes an application of multicriteria methods. Multicriteria methodology proposed herein is applied on priority setting problem. It starts with goal analysis followed by definition of urban infrastructure elements and development of adequate criteria set. Evaluation of criteria importance (weights) is based on a set of experts’ opinions processed by AHP method.

The output of the scheme analysis tool is then incorporated into a wider Value for Money process before the final decision on pavement schemes is undertaken. The scheme analysis tool is not stand alone, but instead {{will be part of the}} Scottish Executive Road Information System (SERIS). Consequently, the analytical framework has been developed to utilise data that is readily available in SERIS and, where relevant, to align with Transport Scotland’s existing procedures. The whole life costs incorporated in the analysis of the pavement schemes include the cost of the candidate scheme itself, the resulting future maintenance costs incurred over the analysis period, user delay cost at roadworks, traffic management costs and, offset against the preceding, a residual value.
