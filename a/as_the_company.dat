5|$|Originally called Capsule Monsters, the game's title {{went through}} several {{transitions}} due to trademark difficulties, becoming CapuMon and KapuMon before eventually settling upon Pocket Monsters.

5|$|The move of {{the company}} of the 45th Battalion down the exposed slope was disastrous, {{possibly}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> commander had not been advised of the particular difficulties involved. Moving in artillery formation, they were shelled and came under intense machine gun fire, suffering 11 killed and 37 wounded. The survivors scrambled to the embankment in small groups. Although the Official History is silent on who was responsible for this debacle, in his notebooks, the Official Historian, Charles Bean, blamed Imlay.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> expanded, it {{was subject}} to several legal issues {{regarding}} trademarks. Because of its use {{as a case study}} in American law schools, {{one of the most prominent}} incidents of infringement in the United States occurred with the similarly named Burger King located in Mattoon, Illinois. Eugene and Elizabeth Hoots owned an ice cream shop in the city of Mattoon; due to the success of the store, in 1957 they expanded it with an additional shop in a former garage next to the original operation. Keeping with theme related to the name of the ice cream shop, Frigid Queen, they named their burger stand Burger King and registered their trademark with the state of Illinois in 1959. In 1962 The Hootses, with knowledge of the Federal trademark held by Burger King Corporation, added a second location in Charleston, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Selby Canal {{began in}} 1775, {{and it was}} opened on 29 April 1778. The new cut at Castleford opened in spring 1775, while those at Knostrop and Hunslet were {{finished}} in 1779. Methley cut was completed, but Woodlesford was not, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> bought the mill there instead. All locks were replaced, and the total cost was over £60,000, of which around £20,000 was for the Selby Canal. The navigation remained profitable, paying £9,000 in dividends in 1775, which had risen to £32,000 by 1791. Most traffic now used the Selby route, and the transhipment facilities at Airmyn were closed in 1779.|$|E

5|$|Engineers Robert W. Blackwell & Co {{provided}} a small 0-4-0 electric locomotive capable of pulling two loaded coal wagons. It {{is not known}} where the locomotive was manufactured, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> has no record, but {{the design of the}} controls suggests that it may have been imported from Germany. A small railcar with space for 12passengers was also provided. The locomotive and the railcar were each fitted with a single trolley pole to collect electricity from the overhead wire. The passenger car was used for the duration of passenger services on the line, and the locomotive from the electrification of the line until closure in 1959. At that time, it was the oldest operational electric locomotive in the British Isles.|$|E
5|$|Evins {{incorporated}} Cracker Barrel in February 1970, {{and soon}} opened more locations. In the early 1970s, the firm leased land on gasoline station sites near interstate highways to build restaurants. These early locations all featured gas pumps on-site; during gasoline shortages {{in the mid}} to late 1970s, the firm began to build restaurants without pumps. Into the early 1980s, the company reduced the number of gas stations on-site, eventually phasing them out altogether <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> focused on its restaurant and gift sales revenues. Cracker Barrel became a publicly traded company in 1981 to raise funds for further expansion. It floated {{more than half a million}} shares, raising $4.6 million. Following the initial public offering, Cracker Barrel grew at a rate of around 20percent per year; by 1987, the company had become a chain of more than 50 units in eight states, with annual net sales of almost $81 million.|$|E
5|$|Halos {{characters}} were continually refined through development, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> {{was bought by}} Microsoft and the platform shifted from the Macintosh to the Xbox. Other Bungie developers would often add input to the progress of characters in Halo, {{even if they were}} not working on the game itself. For example, an outside artist, Shi Kai Wang, developed the early concept sketches of what would eventually become the Master Chief. However upon developing a 3D model, the artists decided the Chief looked too slender, almost effeminate, and subsequently bulked up the character. Early Covenant Elites had a more natural jaw rather than the split mandibles they would later sport; at one point, Jason Jones was also insistent about having a tail on the Elites, but this idea was eventually dropped.|$|E
