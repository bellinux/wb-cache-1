5|$|David {{has been}} {{featured}} {{in a number of}} promotional materials for the Alien prequel films. For Prometheus, rather than focusing on the film's connection with the Alien canon, the marketing team emphasized central characters, most prominently David. On March 17, 2012, director Ridley Scott hosted a panel for Prometheus at WonderCon, where attendees were provided with Weyland Corporation business cards that provided a website <b>and</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>number.</b> Upon calling the number, callers were played an automated message that stated that Weyland Corporation's lines were busy, at which point a text message was sent that linked to a video narrated by Fassbender that showed David being unboxed, prior to his awakening. A month later, on April 17, an extended version of the unboxing video was released, with David providing additional insight into his function aboard the Prometheus as the ship's butler and maintenance man, as well as advertising his ability to seamlessly replicate human emotions without the restrictions of ethics or distress. Released with the video was also a poster featuring David, which was printed as a full-page advertisement in The Wall Street Journal.|$|E

He also had enquiries from the Irish media. This eventually ceased following publicity on his plight.|$|E
25|$|Since the boro taxis {{are part}} of the livery services, they are {{associated}} with companies (or bases). The decals of base station name <b>and</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>number</b> are affixed on the rear panel of the vehicle. Customers can call the bases for pre-arranged trips. The passengers for pre-arranged trips can negotiate the price, but can only be picked up in all the outer boroughs (including the airports) and north of the yellow zone in Manhattan. These airport pick-ups by boro taxis are only allowed for pre-arranged trips.|$|E

25|$|In November 1996, the CAN name, logo <b>and</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>number</b> {{were bought}} in Bankruptcy Court by another Scientologist attorney, Steven Hayes, whose partner Timothy Bowles had {{at one time}} been {{partners}} with Moxon. According to Moxon, Scott had not collected any part of his judgment at that time, as both CAN and Ross had declared bankruptcy. In early December, Scott reconciled {{with his mother and}} settled with Ross for $5,000, and 200 hours of professional services to be supplied by Ross. Moxon filed unsuccessful emergency motions alleging that Scott must have been coerced, but admitted he had no proof of this. In December 1996, Scott replaced Moxon as his attorney with Church of Scientology opponent Graham Berry.|$|E
500|$|It was {{the first}} time when the PES results were fully {{analyzed}} in Zambia compared to previous years when they were only partially analyzed. The PES was aimed at finding the common issues to be considered for future census enumeration activities. PES was applied in every stage of sample design, enumeration, matching, reconciliation and the application of Dual System Estimation methodology. The major recommendations from PES were to have a pilot PES, have effective sample design and data collection of PES, match data between PES and actual enumeration by having correct names of respondents, computerize matching and include cell phone <b>and</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>number</b> of the respondents. The results of the PES indicated that 92.7 per cent of total Zambian residents were captured in the 2010 census, leaving an under count of 7.3 per cent. The estimated under count was 9.5 per cent [...] of the total population in rural areas and 3.8 per cent in the urban areas.|$|E

30|$|Given {{that the}} {{population}} is “abstract” (i.e., {{it was not possible}} to obtain a list of all members of the focal population), a non-probability (purposive) sample was obtained. In a purposive sample, participants are screened for inclusion based on criteria associated with members of the focal population. To achieve a convenience sample, an extensive list of employed and self-employed individuals’ names <b>and</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>numbers</b> was used to distribute surveys <b>and</b> to conduct <b>telephone</b> interviews. To create a list of <b>telephone</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>and</b> addresses, referrals from friends, relatives, family members, and religious places such as temples were used. In addition, <b>telephone</b> directories <b>and</b> the internet were used to collect business names, addresses <b>and</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>numbers</b> of research participants.|$|R

500|$|On 21 March 2016, Pitchfork Media {{reported}} that Jai and A.K. Paul {{had created the}} Paul Institute. Although {{the nature of this}} project was not disclosed at the time, a press release revealed that it is a collaboration between the brothers, and artist Muz Azar, with the intent of also potentially introducing other artists. Devoid of information, its website prompted visitors to provide their country <b>and</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>number</b> in order to receive a passcode which granted access to updates. DIY writer Tom Connick commented on the attention the project captured saying: [...] "With little effort and even less output, Jai and A.K. Paul quickly built up the kind of mystique thousands of bedroom producers and their pricey publicists would kill for. Zane Lowe premiered [...] "Landcruisin three days later on his Beats 1 radio programme, where it was played three consecutive times; he described it as [...] "Blade Runner pop". The song was made available that day for Paul Institute members through digital download and streaming, while public SoundCloud and iTunes releases were enabled on 25 March. A limited-edition, autographed 7" [...] vinyl record, exclusive to registered users of the Paul Institute, was also released.|$|E
500|$|During the 2012 WonderCon, {{attendees}} at the film's panel {{were given}} Weyland Corporation business cards that directed {{them to a}} website <b>and</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>number.</b> After calling the number, the caller was sent a text message from Weyland Corporation that linked them to a video that was presented as an advertisement for the [...] "David 8" [...] android, narrated by Fassbender. An extended version of the video, released on April 17, 2012, lists the android's features, including its ability to seamlessly replicate human emotions without the restrictions of ethics or distress. A full page [...] "David 8" [...] advertisement was placed in The Wall Street Journal; a Twitter account operated by a David8, that allowed Twitter users to ask the character questions, was included. A partnership with Verizon FiOS was launched, offering a virtual tour of the Prometheus spaceship. Another video, [...] "Quiet Eye", starring Rapace as Shaw, was released on May 16, 2012, and debuted on the Verizon FIOS Facebook page. In a telephone call monitored by Yutani, a fictional company from the Alien series, Shaw requests Weyland's aid to seek out alien life. In France, the Saint-Martin ghost train station was converted to resemble alien architecture from the film, and was visible to passing commuters. The campaign continued after the film's release with a website that was listed during the film's end credits. The site referenced the philosophical novel Thus Spoke Zarathustra by Friedrich Nietzsche, and featured a video of Weyland, who quotes from the book. Another video followed in September 2012, featuring Elba's Captain Janek preparing for a mission.|$|E

Reyat also bought smokeless gunpowder from a sporting goods store, signing [...] "I. Reyat" [...] on the explosives log. Study of debris from the Narita explosion would eventually show the bomb had been housed inside a Sanyo tuner with a serial number matching a model sold only in British Columbia, and used a Micronta clock as a timer which powered a relay with an Eveready 12-volt battery to trigger blasting caps to set off a high explosive consistent with sticks of dynamite, all matching items purchased by Reyat. This would lead to his eventual conviction. As late as 2010, Reyat admitted only to buying and assembling some parts, but denied he ever made a bomb, knew what the bomb was to be used for, who was behind any plot, or that he ever asked or knew {{the name of the}} man who he said stayed in his house for a week completing construction of the explosive device after his device failed.|$|E
