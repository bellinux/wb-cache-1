5|$|Each year, {{many people}} are killed or seriously injured by severe {{thunderstorms}} despite the advance warning. While severe thunderstorms are most common {{in the spring and}} summer, they can occur at just about <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the year.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{thunderstorms}} {{can sometimes}} produce hail, very strong straight line winds and tornadoes. Very heavy rainfall from thunderstorms {{can result in}} flash flooding. Thunderstorms occur most often during the summer but can occur at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the year.|$|E
5|$|Chavrusa {{learning}} {{takes place}} in the formalized structure of the yeshiva or kollel, as well as in Talmudic study that an individual does at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> day. Although a man skilled in learning could study certain topics on his own, the chavrusa relationship is preferred to help him crystallize his thoughts.|$|E

5|$|Frigatebirds {{typically}} breed on remote oceanic islands, {{generally in}} colonies {{of up to}} 5000 birds. Within these colonies, they most often nest in groups of 10 to 30 (or rarely 100) individuals. Breeding can occur at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> year, often prompted by commencement of the dry season or plentiful food.|$|E
5|$|Local magistrates had {{to appoint}} two {{inspectors}} known as visitors {{to ensure that}} factories and mills were complying with the Act; one {{was to be a}} clergyman and the other a Justice of the Peace, neither to have any connection with the mill or factory. The visitors had the power to impose fines for non-compliance and the authority to visit at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the day to inspect the premises.|$|E
5|$|Rules {{defined by}} the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Act govern the use and display of the {{national}} flag. These have been relaxed to allow citizens to fly the flag from vehicles during national holidays and from homes at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the year.|$|E

5|$|Tasmanian forms {{have been}} shown to be frost {{tolerant}} at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> year, which might explain some of their success in spreading and growing in different habitats around the island. This attribute might have allowed them to survive cold periods in Tasmania in the Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|Tornado {{occurrence}} {{is highly}} dependent {{on the time of}} day, because of solar heating. Worldwide, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, between 3 pm and 7 pm local time, with a peak near 5 pm. Destructive tornadoes can occur at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> day. The Gainesville Tornado of 1936, one of the deadliest tornadoes in history, occurred at 8:30 am local time.|$|E
5|$|A pure browser, {{the lesser}} kudu feeds on foliage from bushes and trees, shoots, twigs, and herbs. Despite {{seasonal}} and local variations, foliage from {{trees and shrubs}} constitute 60–80% of the diet throughout the year. The lesser kudu is mainly active at night and during the dawn, and seeks shelter in dense thickets just after the sunrise. The lesser kudu exhibits no territorial behaviour, and fights are rare. While females are gregarious, adult males prefer being solitary. No fixed breeding season is seen; births may occur at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the year. The lesser kudu inhabits dry, flat, and heavily forested regions.|$|E

5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are recorded}} as making 242 unprovoked attacks between 1948 and mid-2004, causing sixteen human fatalities. Ten {{of these were}} {{in the water and}} two were on land; the circumstances of the other four are not known. Most attacks were in the warmer months of the year, though in Florida, with its warmer climate, attacks can happen at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> year. Alligators are considered to be less aggressive than either the Nile or saltwater crocodile, but the increase in density of the human population in the Everglades has brought people and alligators into closer proximity and increased the risk of alligator attacks. Conversely in Mauritania, where the crocodiles' growth is severely stunted by the arid conditions, the local people swim with them without being attacked.|$|E
5|$|Blackcurrants {{can grow}} well on sandy or heavy loams, or forest soils, {{as long as}} their {{nutrient}} requirements are met. They prefer damp, fertile but not waterlogged ground and are intolerant of drought. Although the bushes are winter hardy, frosts during the flowering period may adversely affect the yield and cold winds may restrict the number of flying insects visiting and pollinating the flowers. A pH of about 6 is ideal for blackcurrants and the ground can be limed if the soil is too acidic. Planting is usually done in the autumn or winter to allow the plants to become established before growth starts in the spring, but container-grown stock can be planted at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> year.|$|E
5|$|Fishing, {{including}} ice fishing, is {{a common}} pastime on Lake Chillisquaque. Fishing and boating are permitted on the lake at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> day, although boats fuelled by gasoline are forbidden. Boating of any kind is also forbidden annually between March 15 and April 30 and is also forbidden in Goose Cove year-round. The only area for boating access on the lake is {{on the eastern side}} of the lake, at the Heron Cove Boat Access Area. The paddling and running stages of the Chilli Challenge triathlon are on Lake Chillisquaque and the Chillisuagi Trail, respectively.|$|E

5|$|However, {{without the}} ability to {{effectively}} track weak laser signals, collection of atmospheric data would be relegated to times of day where the sun's electromagnetic emissions did not drown out the laser's signal. The addition of an atomic line filter to the LIDAR equipment effectively filters interference to the laser's signal {{to the point where}} LIDAR data can be collected at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the day. For the past decade, Faraday filters have been used to do this. Consequently, scientists know significantly more today about the Earth's middle atmosphere than they did before the advent of the FADOF.|$|E
5|$|In the tropics, many {{amphibians}} breed continuously or at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> year. In temperate regions, breeding {{is mostly}} seasonal, {{usually in the}} spring, and is triggered by increasing day length, rising temperatures or rainfall. Experiments have shown the importance of temperature, but the trigger event, especially in arid regions, is often a storm. In anurans, males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active.|$|E
5|$|Influenza spreads {{around the}} world in a yearly outbreak, {{resulting}} in about three to five million cases of severe illness and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths. In the Northern and Southern parts of the world, outbreaks occur mainly in winter while in areas around the equator outbreaks may occur at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the year. Death occurs mostly in the young, the old and those with other health problems. Larger outbreaks known as pandemics are less frequent. In the 20th century, three influenza pandemics occurred: Spanish influenza in 1918 (~50 million deaths), Asian influenza in 1957 (two million deaths), and Hong Kong influenza in 1968 (one million deaths). The World Health Organization declared an outbreak of a new type of influenza A/H1N1 to be a pandemic in June 2009. Influenza may also affect other animals, including pigs, horses and birds.|$|E

5|$|Preparedness {{refers to}} {{precautions}} {{that should be}} taken before a thunderstorm. Some preparedness {{takes the form of}} general readiness (as a thunderstorm can occur at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the day or year). Preparing a family emergency plan, for example, can save valuable time if a storm arises quickly and unexpectedly. Preparing the home by removing dead or rotting limbs and trees, which can be blown over in high winds, can also significantly reduce the risk of property damage and personal injury.|$|E
5|$|The kōata, {{the growing}} {{tip of the}} plant, was eaten raw as medicine. When cooked, {{it was called the}} kōuka. If the spike of unopened leaves and a few outer leaves is gripped firmly at the base and bent, it will snap off. The leaves can be removed, and what remains is like a small {{artichoke}} heart that can be steamed, roasted or boiled to make kōuka, a bitter vegetable available at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the year. Kōuka is delicious as a relish with fatty foods like eel, muttonbirds, or pigeons, or in modern times, pork, mutton and beef. Different trees were selected for their degree of bitterness, which should be strong for medicinal use, but less so when used as a vegetable.|$|E
5|$|The {{small round}} yellow fruit ripen and turn red at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> year, {{although}} they peak in autumn and winter (April to July). Known as a syconium, the fruit is an inverted inflorescence with the flowers lining an internal cavity. Ficusobliqua is pollinated by {{two species of}} fig wasp—Pleistodontes greenwoodi and P.xanthocephalus. Many species of bird, including pigeons, parrots and various passerines, eat the fruit. The range is along the east coast from Queensland, through New South Wales in rainforest, savanna woodland, sclerophyll forest and gallery forest. It {{is used as a}} shade tree in parks and public spaces, and is well-suited for use as an indoor plant or in bonsai. All parts of the tree have been used in traditional medicine in Fiji.|$|E
