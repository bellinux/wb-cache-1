One of the greatest rewards in politics is meeting people. And one of the greatest and most unusual men I've ever met is Bill Dodd.|$|E
500|$|On his {{approach}} to casting, Stallone {{said that he was}} looking for actors who had not experienced recent success in film: [...] "I like using people that had a moment and then maybe have fallen on some hard times and give them another shot. So we’re always looking for actors like Michael Biehn and Michael Paré. I like those kinds of guys. Someone did it for me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see if I can do it for them." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the success of Frozen, {{director}} Chris Buck stated: [...] "We never expected anything like this. We just hoped {{to make a movie}} that did as well as Tangled! I hoped the audience would embrace it and respond to it, but there's no way we could have predicted this." [...] He cited a number of reasons for the film's popularity: [...] "There are characters that people relate to; the songs are so strong and memorable. We also have some flawed characters, which is what Jen <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> do– we essentially create two imperfect princesses." [...] As Frozen approached the first anniversary of its release, Menzel mentioned the film's continuing popularity in an October 2014 interview: [...] "It’s just a remarkable thing. Usually you do a project and it has its moment. This just feels like it keeps going." ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{predominantly}} a striker, Samaras {{can also}} {{play as a}} left midfielder. During his time at Manchester City, Samaras expressed his disappointment at being used on the left of midfield too often, he publicly said to manager Sven-Göran Eriksson; [...] "I am not a left-midfielder, I am a striker <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> play there," [...] However, after his move to Celtic, Samaras was more open to playing as a left midfielder. The Daily Mail {{said that this was}} because he was happier at Celtic and more willing to be a team player. In addition to being able to play as a target man, Samaras can also be used in several different roles when playing up front. His natural style of play is to drift off the front line and provide a link between the attack and midfield. In doing this he can use his pace and skill to run at the defence, while also creating chances or opening up space for his teammates. He can also run beyond the centre-backs and his pace means he can run on to through balls hit over the defence.|$|E

The Lost Thing is a strong example where Tan makes visual references to famous artworks. Many of his influences are a lot more subtle visually, some of the influences are ideological.

And then I pray to Christ to say, 'Thank you for this day and {{my family and my}} health,' and now that I'm older I've added, 'Please illuminate me. Please open my heart chakra. Open my aperture and uplift my consciousness so that I can be the best version of myself.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Armatrading {{performs}} on both six- and twelve-string acoustic {{and electric}} guitars. She has played on Ovation acoustic instruments since 1973, {{and said this}} about them {{in an interview with}} the magazine Guitar Player: [...] "I'm a bit of a hitter, you see – I bash – <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have everything going at once: bass, harmony, and melody. This is why I love Ovations. They are very powerful-sounding guitars, and when I hit those strings, they ring with a nice, clear, percussive – but not overly bright – sound that highlights the rhythms I like to play." [...] She has played Stratocaster and Gibson electric guitars. For her 2012–13 tour, she performed on six- and 12-string Ovations and customised Tom Anderson guitars.|$|E

2500|$|Shane Richie {{revealed}} that viewers dislike seeing Kat and Alfie happy. Speaking to Inside Soap Richie commented: [...] "People don't {{like it when}} Kat and Alfie are really happy. I never used to believe that, but I do this time around. The way that Jessie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> think {{of it is that}} there's the curtain in the Queen Vic that separates the bar from their home – until you go behind it, you'd never have any idea there were problems. The bar is Kat and Alfie's public stage." [...] With the possibility that Alfie could be the father of Tommy, Richie added: [...] "As soon as I found out, I thought, 'If Alfie isn't infertile, then surely Tommy could be his son'. Jessie and I spoke about the dates of when Alfie was in prison, and when he saw Kat before she had the fling with Michael. The writers reckon they don't match up, but we think they do. Jessie is quite adamant about it!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Like all {{his other}} films, Bhansali {{preferred}} shooting at a studio. Bhansali says, [...] "I like to construct sets and then light it up. It {{is a part}} of my story telling.

Before the actual filming started, Hrithik Roshan spent time with a lot of patients to understand his role better and get into the skin of his character. He revealed that he used to [...] ".. spend six hours with the patients, initially once a week and then once a month. I used to go to understand what they go through, what they think, what their needs are. They have taught me a lot of things. So if I have benefited from this experience so much, I am sure that when people see the film and understand the character, they will get a lot to learn".|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{after his}} death, his grave became a shrine. One teenaged girl in North Belfast {{set up a}} shrine to Wright in her bedroom {{complete}} with his photographs. She explained to a journalist, [...] "I'm not interested in pop stars. Billy was a real Loyalist hero <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> go {{to sleep at night}} looking at him". Gunmen at a paramilitary display in Portadown in 2000 told journalists: [...] "He [...] did {{what he had to do}} to ensure that our faith and culture were kept intact." [...] Wright was also taken up as an inspiration by Johnny Adair and the UDA West Belfast Brigade. In the immediate aftermath of Wright's killing Adair told his main gunmen Stephen McKeag and Gary Smyth that they had a free hand to [...] "avenge" [...] Wright's death, with McKeag almost immediately launching a machine gun attack on a bar in a mainly Catholic area despite the UDA being officially on ceasefire. The West Belfast Brigade would later reference Wright as a true loyalist who had been a victim of the UVF in a leaflet circulated to foment a feud between the UDA and the UVF. Despite this the two men had had a fractured relationship during Wright's life and according to Adair's sometime girlfriend Jackie [...] "Legs" [...] Robinson, Adair had told her that Wright was a [...] "bastard" [...] when the UVF leader attended a party at Robinson's house. Robinson wrote the incident off as jealousy on Adair's part as Wright was already well established as a leading figure in loyalism by that stage whilst Adair was still making his name.|$|E
