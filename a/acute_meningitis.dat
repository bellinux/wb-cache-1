40|$|Background: <b>Acute</b> {{bacterial}} <b>meningitis</b> frequently causes cortical and hippocampal neuron {{loss leading}} to permanent neurological sequelae. Neuron death in <b>acute</b> bacterial <b>meningitis</b> involves the excessive activation of NMDA receptors and p 53 -mediated apoptosis, {{and the latter}} is triggered by the depletion of NAD + and ATP cellular stores by the DNA repair enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. This enzyme is activated during <b>acute</b> bacterial <b>meningitis</b> in response to DNA damage induced, on its turn, by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. An excess of homocysteine can also induce this cascade of events in hippocampal neurons. The present work aimed at investigating the possible involvement of homocysteine in the pathophysiology of meningitis by comparing its concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from children with viral or <b>acute</b> bacterial <b>meningitis,</b> and control individuals. Methods: Homocysteine and cysteine concentrations were assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography in CSF samples from nine patients with <b>acute</b> bacterial <b>meningitis,</b> 13 patients with viral meningitis and 18 controls (median age: 4 years-old; range: < 1 to 13) collected by lumbar puncture at admission at the Children's Hospital Joao Paulo II - FHEMIG, from January 2010 to November 2011. Results: We found that homocysteine accumulates up to neurotoxic levels within {{the central nervous system}} of patients with <b>acute</b> bacterial <b>meningitis,</b> but not in those with viral meningitis or control individuals. No correlation was found between homocysteine and cysteine concentrations and the cerebrospinal fluid standard cytochemical parameters. Conclusions: Our results suggest that HCY is produced intrathecally in response to <b>acute</b> bacterial <b>meningitis</b> and accumulates within the central nervous system reaching potentially neurotoxic levels. This is the first work to propose a role for HCY in the pathophysiology of brain damage associated with <b>acute</b> bacterial <b>meningitis...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Early {{differential}} diagnosis between acute bacterial and viral meningitis is problematic. We aimed {{to investigate whether}} the detection of lipocalin 2, a protein of the acute innate immunity response, {{may be used as}} a marker for <b>acute</b> bacterial <b>meningitis.</b> METHODS: Transgenic mice expressing the human transferrin were infected by intraperitoneal route and were imaged. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was sampled up to 48 hours post- infection to measure lipocalin 2. We also tested a collection of 90 and 44 human CSF with confirmed acute bacterial or <b>acute</b> viral <b>meningitis</b> respectively. RESULTS: Lipocalin 2 was detected after 5  h in CSF during experimental infection in mice. Lipocalin 2 levels were significantly higher (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001) in patients with confirmed <b>acute</b> bacterial <b>meningitis</b> (mean 125  pg/mL, range 106 - 145  pg/mL) than in patients with <b>acute</b> viral <b>meningitis</b> (mean 2  pg/mL, range 0 - 6  pg/mL) with a sensitivity of 81 %, a specificity of 93 %, a positive predictive value of 96 % and a negative predictive value of 71 % in diagnosing <b>acute</b> bacterial <b>meningitis.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of lipocalin 2 in cerebrospinal fluid may discriminate between acute bacterial and viral meningitis in patients with clinical syndrome of meningitis...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{diagnosis}} of <b>acute</b> bacterial <b>meningitis</b> in children is difficult in sub-Saharan Africa, because the clinical features overlap {{with those of}} other common diseases, and laboratory facilities are inadequate in many areas. We have assessed the value of non-laboratory tests and incomplete laboratory data in diagnosing childhood <b>acute</b> bacterial <b>meningitis</b> in this setting. METHODS: We prospectively studied 905 children undergoing lumbar puncture at a rural district hospital in Kenya over 1 year. We related microbiological findings and cerebrospinal-fluid (CSF) laboratory measurements to tests that would typically be available at such a hospital. FINDINGS: <b>Acute</b> bacterial <b>meningitis</b> was proven in 45 children (5. 0 % [95 % CI 3. 7 - 6. 6]) and probable in 26 (2. 9 % [1. 9 - 4. 2]). 21 of the 71 cases of proven or probable <b>acute</b> bacterial <b>meningitis</b> had neither neck stiffness nor turbid CSF. In eight of 45 children with proven disease the CSF leucocyte count was less than 10 x 10 (6) /L or leucocyte counting was not possible because of blood-staining. The presence of either a leucocyte count of 50 x 10 (6) /L or more or a CSF/blood glucose ratio of 0. 10 or less detected all but two of the 45 children with proven acute bacterial meningitis; these two samples were grossly blood-stained. INTERPRETATION: The {{diagnosis of}} childhood <b>acute</b> bacterial <b>meningitis</b> is likely to be missed in a third of cases at district hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa without adequate and reliable laboratory resources.

50|$|Toscana virus (TOSV) is an {{arbovirus}} (arthropod-borne virus) {{belonging to}} Bunyaviridae, {{a family of}} negative-stranded, enveloped RNA viruses. The virus can be transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected sandfly of the genus Phlebotomus. Toscana is not normally associated with disease, as indicated by high seroprevalance rates (up to 25%) in endemic areas, but in common with other sandfly transmitted viruses such as Naples virus and Sicilian virus, infection may result in Pappataci fever, an illness with mild fever, headache and myalgia. In serious cases that go undiagnosed, <b>acute</b> <b>meningitis,</b> meningoencephalitis and encephalitis may occur.

50|$|In adults, {{the most}} common symptom of {{meningitis}} is a severe headache, occurring in almost 90% of cases of bacterial meningitis, followed by nuchal rigidity (the inability to flex the neck forward passively due to increased neck muscle tone and stiffness). The classic triad of diagnostic signs consists of nuchal rigidity, sudden high fever, and altered mental status; however, all three features are present in only 44-46% of bacterial meningitis cases. If {{none of the three}} signs are present, <b>acute</b> <b>meningitis</b> is extremely unlikely. Other signs commonly associated with meningitis include photophobia (intolerance to bright light) and phonophobia (intolerance to loud noises). Small children often do not exhibit the aforementioned symptoms, and may only be irritable and look unwell.

40|$|Rapid {{diagnosis}} and treatment of <b>acute</b> community-acquired bacterial <b>meningitis</b> reduces mortality and neurological sequelae, but can be delayed by atypical presentation, assessment of lumbar puncture safety, and poor sensitivity of standard diagnostic microbiology.

40|$|Background: <b>Acute</b> {{bacterial}} <b>meningitis</b> {{still has}} a high mortality and rate of complications. Aim: To {{assess the impact of}} anti H influenzae vaccination on the epidemiology of <b>acute</b> bacterial <b>meningitis</b> in Chilean children. Material and methods: A retrospective study of hospital discharge records of patients with <b>acute</b> bacterial <b>meningitis.</b> Causative agents were studied globally, by hospital and by age group. The changes in etiology from 1989 to 1995 were also assessed. Between 1996 and 1998, only those patients with <b>acute</b> bacterial <b>meningitis</b> caused by H influenzae were recollected. Results: In the period prior to vaccination (1989 - 1995), 1000 cases were registered. The main causative agents were N meningitidis in 33. 8 %, H influenzas type b in 21. 9 % and S pneumoniae in 15. 4 %. The incidence of H influenzae decreased in the period from 36. 4 to 9. 9 % (p< 0. 001) and the incidence of N meningitidis increased from 22. 9 to 52. 1 % (p < 0. 001). The incidence of S pneumoniae did not change significantly. H influenzae predominated in children between 4 and 24 months of age and N meningitidis predominated in children over 25 months of age. In the period after the introduction of vaccination (1995 - 1998), there was a further decrease in the incidence of H influenzae from 10 to 2 % (p < 0. 001). Until 1997, there was a considerable increase in the incidence of N meningitidis, specially in children over 25 months of age. It declined in 1998 to 38 %. Conclusions: There was a reduction in the incidence of <b>acute</b> bacterial <b>meningitis</b> caused by H influenzae prior to the introduction of the vaccine against H influenzae type b.

To {{evaluate}} {{the diagnostic and}} prognostic role of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S- 100 protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with <b>acute</b> bacterial <b>meningitis</b> {{in the course of}} the disease. Materials and Methods. 54 cases of <b>acute</b> bacterial <b>meningitis</b> were analyzed, among them – 26 with pneumococcal and 28 with meningococcal etiology. Patients were divided into groups depending on the severity and etiology of disease. In addition to routine laboratory methods, we analyzed the CSF levels of S- 100 protein and NSE at admission and after 10 – 12 days of treatment. 12 patients with acute respiratory infections and meningism were examined as a comparison group. Results. In all patients with <b>acute</b> bacterial <b>meningitis</b> CSF NSE and protein S- 100 levels were significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0, 05). CSF neuro specific proteins level was in direct dependence on severity of the disease, and in patients with severe disease was significantly higher than in patients with moderate severity and in the control group (P < 0, 01). After 10 – 12 days of treatment, the level of the NSE and S- 100 protein decreased, but in severe cases was still higher than in the control group (P < 0, 05). Conclusions. Increased cerebrospinal fluid NSE and S – 100 protein levels shows the presence and value of neurons and glial cells damage in patients with <b>acute</b> bacterial <b>meningitis.</b> CSF S- 100 protein and neuron-specific enolase levels help to determine the severity of neurons destruction and glial cells in patients with <b>acute</b> bacterial <b>meningitis.</b> Level of neurospecific protein is in direct proportion to the severity of the disease and is the highest in patients with severe cases (P< 0, 05). It confirms the diagnostic and prognostic value of CSF neurospecific protein determination in patients with bacterial meningitis. ...|$|R
50|$|Any of the {{components}} of the nervous system can be involved. Sarcoidosis affecting the nervous system is known as neurosarcoidosis. Cranial nerves are most commonly affected, accounting for about 5-30% of neurosarcoidosis cases, and peripheral facial nerve palsy, often bilateral, is the most common neurological manifestation of sarcoidosis. It occurs suddenly and is usually transient. The central nervous system involvement is present in 10-25% of sarcoidosis cases. Other common manifestations of neurosarcoidosis include optic nerve dysfunction, papilledema, palate dysfunction, neuroendocrine changes, hearing abnormalities, hypothalamic and pituitary abnormalities, chronic meningitis, and peripheral neuropathy. Myelopathy, that is spinal cord involvement, occurs in about 16-43% of neurosarcoidosis cases and is often associated with the poorest prognosis of the neurosarcoidosis subtypes. Whereas facial nerve palsies and <b>acute</b> <b>meningitis</b> due to sarcoidosis tends to have the most favourable prognosis. Another common finding in sarcoidosis with neurological involvement is autonomic or sensory small fiber neuropathy. Neuroendocrine sarcoidosis accounts for about 5-10% of neurosarcoidosis cases and can lead to diabetes insipidus, changes in menstrual cycle and hypothalamic dysfunction. The latter can lead to changes in body temperature, mood and prolactin (see the endocrine and exocrine section for details).|$|E
