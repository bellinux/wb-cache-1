5000|$|In {{the law of}} debtor and creditor, <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> is the {{application}} <b>of</b> a particular <b>payment</b> {{for the purpose of}} paying a particular debt. When a creditor has two debts due to him from the same debtor on distinct accounts, the general law as to the <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> made by the debtor is that the debtor is entitled to apply the payments to such account as he thinks fit; solvitur in modum solventis. In default <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> by the debtor the creditor is entitled to determine {{the application}} of the sums paid, and may appropriate them even to the discharge of debts barred by the Statute of Limitations. In default <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> by either debtor or creditor, the law implies an <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> the earlier <b>payments</b> to the earlier debts ...|$|R
50|$|This {{unique and}} unusual article (added by Amendment 1) prohibits the General Assembly from making <b>appropriations</b> for <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> {{principal}} and interest on several bond issues from 1869 to 1871, {{commonly referred to as}} Holford bonds. They were passed during Reconstruction by the General Assembly. Some of the bonds refinanced disputed debt outstanding from shortly after Arkansas' statehood in 1836. These bonds had been central to the Brooks-Baxter War.|$|R
40|$|A brief {{examination}} {{of the history of}} the guarantee reveals that equity treated the guarantor as a favoured debtor, given the absence of real benefit to the guarantor. However, these protections have largely been removed by standard form guarantee contracts used by, credit providers, and the law is also otherwise deficient in protecting consumer guarantors. As the expansion of the use of credit in recent years has meant that guarantees are now sometimes given carelessly and thoughtlessly, by persons without adequate education and resources to protect their interests, regulation is required (Chapter 1). The statutory regulation of guarantees before the passing of the Credit Act was inadequate. After examining the scope and nature of the Credit Act, the effect of the Credit Act on the regulation of guarantees is examined (Chapter 2). The extent to which the common law and statute law regulate pre-contractual information given to guarantors is then examined. It is concluded that room for improvement exists (Chapter 3). The extent to which the common law and statute law regulate the exercise of undue influence, unfair pressure and the making of unconscionable bargains is then examined and it is concluded that developments will occur rapidly in this area (Chapter 4). Common law and statutory provisions which discharge the guarantor from liability are then examined in the light of the operation of the Credit Act and it is concluded that some flaws exist both in principle and in the operation of the law (Chapter 5). The extent to which the guarantor is entitled to control the <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> made by the debtor, and the extent to which the guarantor's liability is coextensive with that of the debtor is then examined and some changes suggested (Chapter 6). The guarantor's rights to have action taken first against the debtor and the debtor's assets, the guarantor's rights to notice before action, and the right of indemnification after action, are then examined (Chapter 7). The possible reasons for the non-regulation of guarantees are examined and dismissed; past suggestions for reform and possible future reforms are examined (Chapter 8). Standard form contracts of guarantee are discussed and the text of a draft fair, simple English, standard form guarantee is suggested (Chapter 9). The law is as stated at 30 November, 1985.

40|$|After the {{implementation}} of the tax division system, the central <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> special funds remains, but there will be no further increase in the total amount of such funds. At the same time, the establishment <b>of</b> a transfer <b>payment</b> system {{at the core of the}} tax division system will add new contents to the central <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> special funds. In this respect, the amount of centrally appropriated special funds will increase at a more rapid pace, which requires more efficient management. However, if we only pay attention to the absolute amount of the funds, while neglecting the rational distribution and management of the funds, the central <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> special funds will lose its original meaning.

30|$|Significantly, however, an {{in-depth}} analysis {{suggests that this}} perspective fails to distinguish between CIHL and IHL treaties. As IHL treaties definitively prohibit <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> civilian property through illegal force, through the prohibition of pillage in GC IV Art 33, AP II (1977) Art 4  g), and also RS Art 8 2 (e) (v) and 8 2 (b) (xvi). In addition, the only allowance for legal <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> civilian property is found in RS Art 8 2 (a) (iv). This analysis has shown that allowances in CIHL for <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> civilian property due to imperative military necessity are extremely specific and do not, in any circumstances, justify pillage. We can maintain therefore that under IHL, pillage, or the <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> civilian property by illegal force is categorically prohibited.|$|R
