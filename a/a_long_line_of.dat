5|$|It's {{strange to}} hear Uncle Tupelo {{mentioned}} {{because what we}} were doing was in such <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> musical history. People are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything because we were just picking up the ball, starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early '60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that we were influenced by. We didn't start a genre. We contributed to <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> fairly good music. That's the way we looked at it at the time—doing what was right for the song.|$|E

5|$|Cibber's poetical {{work was}} derided in his time, {{and has been}} remembered only for being poor. His {{importance}} in British theatre history rests on his {{being one of the}} first in <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> actor-managers, on the interest of two of his comedies as documents of evolving early 18th-century taste and ideology, and on the value of his autobiography as a historical source.|$|E
5|$|Like biochemistry, the {{overlapping}} disciplines of bacteriology and virology (later combined as microbiology), situated {{between science and}} medicine, developed rapidly in the early 20th century.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>long</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> subwoofers placed {{horizontally}} {{along the}} front edge of the stage can be delayed such that the center subs fire several milliseconds prior to the ones flanking them, which fire several milliseconds prior to their neighbors, continuing in this fashion until the last subwoofers are reached at the outside ends of the subwoofer row (beamforming). This method helps to counteract the extreme narrowing of horizontal dispersion pattern seen with a horizontal subwoofer array. Such delay shading can be used to virtually reshape a loudspeaker array.|$|E

Many of his most prominent collaborators and students were Jewish, and some were blood relations. Marcel Mauss, a notable social anthropologist of the pre-war era, was his nephew.
