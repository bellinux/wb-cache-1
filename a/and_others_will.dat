25|$|Bonsai are {{sometimes}} marketed or promoted as house plants, {{but few of}} the traditional bonsai species can thrive or even survive inside a typical house. Most bonsai are located out of doors. The best guideline to identifying a suitable growing environment for a bonsai is its native hardiness. If the bonsai grower can closely replicate the full year's temperatures, relative humidity, and sunlight, the bonsai should do well. In practice, this means that trees from a hardiness zone closely matching the grower's location will generally be the easiest to grow, <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>will</b> require more work or will not be viable at all.|$|E

25|$|The {{propulsion}} {{system of the}} RN ships will have a gas turbine direct drive and four high speed diesel generators driving two electric motors in a combined diesel-electric or gas (CODLOG) configuration. In 2012 Rolls Royce repackaged the MT30 used in the Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers {{so that it would}} fit into smaller ships. The MT30 will be used in the Type 26. BAE Systems have suggested that some customers will install gas turbine engines <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>will</b> prefer to sacrifice 2–3 knots of speed by choosing cheaper diesel engines. The CODLOG configuration for propulsion is a simpler version of the Combined diesel-electric and gas (CODLAG) propulsion used on the Type 23 which this ship is to replace, and both of the Global Combat Ship's design contemporaries – the Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier and the Type 45 destroyer – use integrated electric propulsion (IEP).|$|E
25|$|The {{meristem}} can {{be defined}} as the tissue or group of plant tissues that contain undifferentiated stem cells, which are capable of producing any type of cell tissue. Their maintenance and development, both in the vegetative meristem or the meristem of the inflorescence is controlled by genetic cell fate determination mechanisms. This means that a number of genes will directly regulate, for example, the maintenance of the stem cell’s characteristics (gene WUSCHEL or WUS), <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>will</b> act via negative feedback mechanisms in order to inhibit a characteristic (gene CLAVATA or CLV). In this way both mechanisms give rise to a feedback loop, which along with other elements lend a great deal of robustness to the system. Along with the WUS gene the SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM) gene also represses the differentiation of the meristematic dome. This gene acts by inhibiting the possible differentiation of the stem cells but still allows cell division in the daughter cells, which, had they been allowed to differentiate, would have given rise to distinct organs.|$|E
25|$|Other {{advantages}} of the NPT approach are that it is fast and convenient, usually less painful, and offers, in home use, the ability for patients to measure their own INRs when required. Among its problems are that quite a steady hand is needed to deliver the blood to the exact spot, that some patients find the finger-pricking difficult, and {{that the cost of}} the test strips must also be taken into account. In the UK these are available on prescription so that elderly and unwaged people will not pay for them <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>will</b> pay only a standard prescription charge, which at the moment represents only about 20% of the retail price of the strips. In the USA, NPT in the home is currently reimbursed by Medicare for patients with mechanical heart valves, while private insurers may cover for other indications. Medicare is now covering home testing for patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. Home testing requires a doctor's prescription and that the meter and supplies are obtained from a Medicare approved Independent Diagnostic Testing Facility (IDTF).|$|E

500|$|Hitman Go is a turn-based puzzle {{video game}} {{part of the}} Hitman video game series. In the game each level is set on a grid-based board {{composed}} of interconnected nodes and lines. Nodes are positions that the player or enemies can occupy and lines are used for moving between nodes during a turn. Players {{take control of the}} series' protagonist, Agent 47. Using touchscreen controls, during a turn the player swipes along a line in the direction they want Agent 47 to move. In the [...] "Definitive Edition" [...] on PC, swiping is replaced by a click, hold, and drag interaction with a mouse. Once the player completes a turn, all enemies on the board will simultaneously move. Each level has a main objective for completion, some levels require the player to guide Agent 47 to the end node <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>will</b> require the player to assassinate a specific target. The player can assassinate enemies by moving onto the target's node, and similarly the player can be killed by enemies that move onto the player's node.|$|E
500|$|While Pokémon Gold and Silver {{retain the}} basic {{mechanics}} of capturing, battling, and evolving introduced in Pokémon Red and Blue, new features were added. A time system was introduced using a real-time internal clock that {{keeps track of}} the current time and day of the week. Certain events, including Pokémon appearances, are influenced by this feature. New items were added, with some designed to exploit a new mechanic: Pokémon being able to hold items. A new type of item able to be held was the berry, which comes in varieties and can restore health or cure status effects. Other held items can give boosts to the Pokémon during battle. More specialized Poké Balls were introduced, which make Pokémon catching easier in certain situations. A new item called the [...] was introduced, functioning as a watch, map, radio, and phone, allowing the player to call other characters who offer their phone number.

500|$|In Chicago, {{he founded}} the Mutual Newspaper Publishing Company in 1886 which {{provided}} advertisements and articles to over 200 newspapers. In 1887, he established the weekly [...] "Saturday Blade", an illustrated newspaper aimed at rural audiences and sold by thousands of newsboys—an innovation at the time. By 1892, the Saturday Blade had the largest circulation of any weekly newspaper in the United States. Boyce's detailed reports of his foreign travels provided articles for the [...] "Saturday Blade" [...] and were reprinted in books by atlas/map publisher Rand McNally. The success of the [...] "Saturday Blade" [...] spawned the W. D. Boyce Publishing Company, which Boyce used to buy or start several newspapers and magazines. In 1892, Boyce bought out the [...] "Chicago Ledger", a fiction weekly publication. In January 1903 {{he founded the}} international [...] "Boyce's Weekly", which advocated worker's rights. Boyce's prominence as a supporter of labor attracted labor/union [...] leaders such as John Mitchell of the United Mine Workers and Henry Demarest Lloyd as writers and editors for [...] "Boyce's Weekly". Eight months later, [...] "Boyce's Weekly" [...] was consolidated with the [...] "Saturday Blade." [...] Boyce also established the selected subject/topical newspapers [...] "Farm Business" [...] in 1914 and [...] "Home Folks Magazine" [...] in 1922. Dwindling sales led to the 1925 merger of the [...] "Blade" [...] and [...] "Ledger" [...] into the monthly [...] "Chicago Blade & Ledger", which was published until 1937. As Boyce's enterprises grew, he insisted on looking after the welfare of about 30,000 delivery boys, who were key to his financial success. Working with them may have helped him {{gain an understanding of}} America's youth. Boyce felt that delivering and selling newspapers taught a youth important responsibilities such as being polite, reading human nature, and handling money. Boyce's focused determination was evident in the advice he gave to young men: [...] "There are many obstacles to overcome, but toil, grit and endurance will help you to overcome them all. Help yourself <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>will</b> help you." [...] and [...] "whatever trade you have selected; never swerve from that purpose a single moment until it is accomplished".|$|E

As part of that analysis, a court may examine whether the clause conforms with the formal requirements of the jurisdiction in which the case was filed (in some jurisdictions a choice of forum or choice of venue clause only limits the parties if the word [...] "exclusive" [...] is explicitly included in the clause).
