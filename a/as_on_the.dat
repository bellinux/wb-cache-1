5|$|Abundant and widespread, A.obovatus {{occurs on}} a wide range of soils, favouring soils in the acidic pH range 3.9–5.4. Like most Adenanthos species it is common on deeply leached {{siliceous}} sandplain sand. It also occurs on gravelly quartz sand derived from rock outcrops, such <b>as</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rocky hillslopes of the Stirling Range. It is rarely found on gravelly lateritic soils. It is also one of the few Adenanthos species to grow well in moist environments; it will not tolerate seasonal waterlogging—that niche is filled by A.detmoldii—but thrives in damp soils not subject to waterlogging.|$|E
5|$|After the 1954 New York State Thruway opened from Buffalo to New York City, Michigan {{officials}} encouraged Ontario {{to bypass}} Highway 3 {{as the most}} direct path from Detroit to Buffalo. By 1956, construction had begun on a segment between Highway4 in London and Highway2 in Woodstock, as well <b>as</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> section between Windsor and Tilbury.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} story of the Buddhist {{cosmology}} carved in stone, Borobudur has many statues of various Buddhas.

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> White Pass trail, {{supplies}} {{needed to}} {{be broken down into}} smaller packages and carried in relay. Packers, prepared to carry supplies for cash, were available along the route but would charge up to $1 ($27) per lb (0.45kg) on the later stages; many of these packers were natives: Tlingits or, less commonly, Tagish. Avalanches were common in the mountains and, on April 3, 1898, one claimed the lives of more than 60 people travelling over Chilkoot Pass.|$|E
5|$|Bradner {{worked on}} the 1951 Operation Greenhouse nuclear test series on Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands. He joined the Scripps Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics as a {{geophysicist}} in 1961. He remained there {{for the rest of}} his career, becoming a full professor in 1963, and retiring in 1980. In retirement, continued to work both on oceanographic research, as well <b>as</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> DUMAND deep ocean neutrino astronomy project.|$|E
5|$|Butler, by contrast, {{was seen}} <b>as</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> liberal {{wing of the}} Conservatives, and his {{election}} as leader might split the party.

5|$|Curie's {{likeness}} {{also has}} appeared on banknotes, stamps and coins around the world. She was featured on the Polish late-1980s 20,000-złoty banknote as well <b>as</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> last French 500-franc note, before the franc {{was replaced by the}} euro. Curie themed postage stamps from Mali, the Republic of Togo, Zambia, and the Republic of Guinea actually show a picture of Susan Marie Frontczak portraying Curie in a 2001 picture by Paul Schroeder.|$|E
5|$|Ehlers' {{research}} {{focused on}} the foundations of general relativity as well <b>as</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> theory's applications to astrophysics. He formulated a suitable classification of exact solutions to Einstein's field equations and proved the Ehlers–Geren–Sachs theorem that justifies the application of simple, general-relativistic model universes to modern cosmology. He created a spacetime-oriented description of gravitational lensing and clarified the relationship between models formulated {{within the framework of}} general relativity and those of Newtonian gravity. In addition, Ehlers had a keen interest in both the history and philosophy of physics and was an ardent populariser of science.|$|E
5|$|Facilities at {{the station}} are minimal – there is a metal and glass shelter {{on each of the}} two islands as well <b>as</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bridge. The station is {{completely}} unstaffed, and there are no facilities for buying tickets. There are customer help points, giving next train information for both platforms. There is no car park or taxi rank, nor is there any cycle storage available. There are several bus stops nearby.|$|E

5|$|Further {{neurological}} examinations {{are crucial}} in {{the differential diagnosis}} of AD and other diseases. Interviews with family members are also utilised {{in the assessment of}} the disease. Caregivers can supply important information on the daily living abilities, as well <b>as</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> decrease, over time, of the person's mental function. A caregiver's viewpoint is particularly important, since a person with AD is commonly unaware of his own deficits. Many times, families also have difficulties in the detection of initial dementia symptoms and may not communicate accurate information to a physician.|$|E

5|$|Industrial {{production}} {{in the twentieth century}} relied on treatment with hot, concentrated sulfuric acid in cast iron vessels, followed by selective precipitation by dilution with water, <b>as</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subsequent steps. This method relied on the specifics of the technique and the concentrate grain size; many alternatives have been proposed, but only one has proven effective economically: alkaline digestion with hot sodium hydroxide solution. This is more expensive than the original method but yields a higher purity of thorium; in particular, it removes phosphates from the concentrate.|$|E
5|$|It was {{powered by}} two {{turbofan}} engines with each {{in a separate}} engine nacelle with S-ducts, to shield engine axial compressors from radar waves, {{on either side of}} the aircraft's spine. Of the two aircraft built, the first YF-23 (PAV-1) was fitted with Pratt & Whitney YF119 engines, while the second (PAV-2) was powered by General Electric YF120 engines. The aircraft featured fixed engine nozzles, instead of thrust vectoring nozzles <b>as</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> YF-22. <b>As</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> B-2, the exhaust from the YF-23's engines flowed through troughs lined with heat-ablating tiles to dissipate heat and shield the engines from infrared homing (IR) missile detection from below.|$|E

5|$|Levels contain many {{different}} environment types, including cities, forests, and bogs. At {{the end of}} most levels, the player collects an item called a core or a shard; occasionally, the level begins to disintegrate once the Kid takes the item, forcing him to hastily retreat. As the player progresses through the levels, a voice narrates their actions. This narration gives scripted plot information as well as dynamic comments, such <b>as</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> player's skill with a weapon or performance while fighting enemies.|$|E

40|$|Aim To {{investigate}} {{the accuracy of}} ethnicity data held in Primary Health Organisation (PHO) registers within the Waitemata district of Auckland, New Zealand.
