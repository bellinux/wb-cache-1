The <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> by Jugo Ilic of CSIRO, a wood identification specialist. Many of the samples were too badly deteriorated to be positively identified, as the lack of cellulose remaining in the wood cells prevented successful analysis.|$|E

From the 1980s on, long-term, noninvasive herd {{studies have been}} performed, and in 2007 a genetic <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> that concluded the herd was genetically unique enough to interest conservationists. In 2008, the horses were declared the official horse of Nova Scotia, and in 2011, the island was declared the Sable Island National Park Reserve. The herd is unmanaged, and legally protected from interference by humans. The horses live only at Sable Island and at the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park on the mainland of Nova Scotia, with the latter herd descended from horses removed from Sable Island in the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|However, in a {{subsequent}} analysis of its limb bones, Ullman & Lacovara found that Dreadnoughtus possessed many {{of the characteristics of}} lithostrotians (in particular, it shares a number of traits with Aeolosaurus and Gondwanatitan), which collectively may indicate that it is actually a lithostrotian closely related to Aeolosauridae. While no new phylogenetic <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted,</b> they suggested that future cladistic analyses should investigate the relationships between Dreadnoughtus, Aeolosaurus, and Gondwanatitan.|$|E

25|$|During a {{description}} of the vertebrae of Europasaurus by Carbadillo & Sander (2013), another phylogenetic <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> (right column above). The cladistic matrix was expanded to include more sauropod taxa, such as Bellusaurus, Cedarosaurus and Tapuiasaurus. The taxon Brachiosaurus was also separated into true Brachiosaurus (B. altithorax) and Giraffatitan (B. brancai), based on Taylor (2009). Based on this newer and more expansive analysis, Europasaurus was found to be in a similar placement, as a basal camarasauromorph closer to titanosaurs than Camarasaurus. However, Euhelopus, Tehuelchesaurus, Tastavinsaurus and Galvesaurus were placed between Europasaurus and Brachiosauridae.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} cluster strong lensing were first {{detected}} by Roger Lynds of the National Optical Astronomy Observatories and Vahe Petrosian of Stanford University who discovered giant luminous arcs {{in a survey}} of galaxy clusters in the late 1970s. Lynds and Petrosian published their findings in 1986 without knowing the origin of the arcs. In 1987, Genevieve Soucail of the Toulouse Observatory and her collaborators presented data of a blue ring-like structure in Abell 370 and proposed a gravitational lensing interpretation. The first cluster weak lensing <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> in 1990 by J. Anthony Tyson of Bell Laboratories and collaborators. Tyson et al. detected a coherent alignment of the ellipticities of the faint blue galaxies behind both Abell 1689 and CL 1409+524. Lensing {{has been used as a}} tool to investigate a tiny fraction of the thousands of known galaxy clusters.|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} time since the show debuted, the {{producers}} and a team of researchers analyzed Sesame Streets content and structure, and studied how children's viewing habits had changed. The <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> during a series of two-week-long workshops and was completed in time for the show's 30th anniversary in 1999. [...] The CTW found that although the show was produced for children between the ages of three and five, their viewers had become more sophisticated since its debut and began to watch the show sooner, as early as ten months of age. [...] The producers found that the show's original format, which consisted of a series of short clips similar to the structure of a magazine, was not necessarily the most effective way to hold young viewers' attention. They also found that their viewers, especially the younger ones, lost attention with Sesame Street after 40 to 45 minutes.|$|E

"We {{conclude}} that the Supreme Court has analyzed and upheld the federal statutes regulating the distribution of obscenity under the constitutional right to privacy embodied collectively in the First, Ninth, and Fourteenth (thus also the Fifth) Amendments, {{as well as the}} Griswold line of decisions that the District Court asserted should control this case. The fact that such analysis has never been applied within the precise scenario outlined by the District Court – i.e., use of the talismanic phrase [...] "substantive due process" [...] {{in the context of a}} vendor proceeding under derivative standing on behalf of a consumer’s right to privately possess obscene material – does not negate the binding precedential value of the Supreme Court cases employing that analysis. The Court’s analysis need not be so specific in order to limit a district court’s prerogative to overturn an entire category of federal statutes, even as applied to particular defendants, based on speculation about a later decision that fails even to mention those statutes. The Court has considered the federal statutes regulating the distribution of obscenity in the context of the broader constitutional right to privacy and upheld them. That such <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> absent its constitutional brand name does not negate its precedential value." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{soil from}} which this example was taken was twelve inches deep; it abounded to the eye in {{vegetable}} matter, and was siliceous to the touch. There were no traces of phosphates or of animal matter, and doubtful traces of lime and potash. The subsoil of clay gave only 5.7 per cent. of water, and 5.55 of organic matter. The above <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> during the rainy month of September, and the sample is an average one of the surface-soil at 6000 to 10,000 feet. There is, I think, little difference anywhere in the soils at this elevation, except where the rock is remarkably micaceous, or where veins of felspathic granite, by their decomposition, give rise to small beds of kaolin.|$|E
