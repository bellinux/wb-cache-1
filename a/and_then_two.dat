5|$|In July 1642 Roger Smith subscribed £225 {{under the}} terms of the Adventurers' Act of 1641, whereby money loaned to the {{government}} of Charles I for the purpose of suppressing the Irish rebellion was secured by lands to be confiscated in that country. The lands had been confiscated in law but it would require the overthrow of the rebels in order to realise those property assets. The subsequent Doubling Ordinance of 1643 allowed those who had subscribed to receive twice the amount of land if they added a further 25 per cent of their initial financial aid: Roger Smith accepted those terms, contributing a further £75 in July 1643 <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>two</b> more payments of £75 in August and in October of that year.|$|E
5|$|The Ole Miss lead only {{lasted for}} fifteen seconds, as Christion Jones scored a {{touchdown}} on the kickoff that ensued with his 99-yard return {{that gave the}} Crimson Tide a 13–7 lead. On the Rebels' next possession, Bo Wallace threw an interception to Dee Milliner, and four plays later AJ McCarron threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Amari Cooper that extended the Alabama lead to 20–7. On their next drive, Ole Miss was intercepted by the Crimson Tide on two separate occasions. First Robert Lester intercepted a Bo Wallace pass that he subsequently fumbled and was recovered by Scott, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>two</b> plays later Randall Mackey threw an interception to Deion Belue at the Alabama 32-yard line. The Crimson Tide then drove 68 yards and took a 27–7 halftime lead after McCarron threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Cooper.|$|E

5|$|The next front {{action for}} Ledbury came later on that day, at 08:20, when the {{destroyer}} began signalling, 'Eight air torpedo-bombers 210 degrees, five miles', <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>two</b> minutes later, 'for eight read ten'. Suddenly after Ledburys signals, all the escorts {{seemed to be}} blinking morse-signals at once. The loudspeakers were booming, 'Bombers approaching... there's six of them... there's twelve... there's eighteen... good God, there's twenty-five!' The anti-aircraft ship lurched forward and altered course to head off the attack. Commodore Dowding signalled Keppel to ask if the convoy should make an 'emergency turn'; but it was deemed too late for such a manoeuvre, since half the ships would most likely miss the signal altogether and Broome flashed back, 'I {{do not think it}} worth it.' The developing air attack spotted by Ledbury turned into a blitz of the convoy, with Luftwaffe aircraft being shot down over the formation, and one plane crashed into the sea about four thousand yards from the destroyer , on the convoy's starboard bow. The crash occurred not far from Ledbury and seamen on board saw four German airmen climbing out into a rubber dinghy with the bomber sinking soon after. The pilot, Lieutenant Kaumeyr, and his three crewmen were picked out of their dinghy by Ledbury. The attack however, continued and throughout the fierce fighting the escorts distinguished themselves by screening the merchantmen from many attacks, especially U-boat sorties; Ledbury alone had sighted seven.|$|E
