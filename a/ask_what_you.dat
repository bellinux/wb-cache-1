500|$|In revisiting {{the film}} in the 1970s, Arthur Schlesinger noted that Hollywood films {{generally}} age well, revealing an unexpected depth or integrity, {{but in the case}} of Gone with the Wind time has not treated it kindly. Richard Schickel posits that one measure of a film's quality is to <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> can remember of it, and the film falls down in this regard: unforgettable imagery and dialogue are simply not present. Stanley Kauffmann, likewise, also found the film to be a largely forgettable experience, claiming he could only remember two scenes vividly. Both Schickel and Schlesinger put this down to it being [...] "badly written", in turn describing the dialogue as [...] "flowery" [...] and possessing a [...] "picture postcard" [...] sensibility. Schickel also believes the film fails as popular art, in that it has limited rewatch value—a sentiment that Kauffmann also concurs with, stating that having watched it twice he hopes [...] "never to see it again: twice is twice as much as any lifetime needs". Both Schickel and Andrew Sarris identify the film's main failing is in possessing a producer's sensibility rather than an artistic one: having gone through so many directors and writers the film does not carry a sense of being [...] "created" [...] or [...] "directed", but rather having emerged [...] "steaming from the crowded kitchen", where the main creative force was a producer's obsession in making the film as literally faithful to the novel as possible.|$|E

Rosen is a fiscal conservative and social libertarian who occasionally was a substitute host for Rush Limbaugh. Common Rosen-isms are [...] "tell me where you sit before you tell me where you stand" [...] and [...] "a politician <b>asks</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want, an economist <b>asks</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want more."
