40|$|Wild animal capture {{has progressed}} {{over the years}} from {{trapping}} or physical capture, which was dangerous to both animal and man, to chemical immobilization. Opioids and butyrophenones {{are the most common}} classes of drugs used for ungulate immobilization; however newer drugs and drug combinations are commonly used in an attempt to reduce time to immobilization in wildlife. The enzyme hyaluronidase is often added to drug combinations in the belief that it reduces time to immobilization by improving drug absorption. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} ascertain if the addition of hyaluronidase to an etorphine and <b>azaperone</b> drug combination would be of value in reducing time to immobilization in blue wildebeest. The study also tried to ascertain if the added hyaluronidase enabled one to reduce the etorphine and <b>azaperone</b> doses required to immobilize blue wildebeest, without affecting time to immobilization. The study made use of a four-way cross-over study design, with four treatment groups, four sequences and four periods. The four treatment groups were etorphine and azaperone; etorphine, <b>azaperone</b> and 5000 international units (IU) hyaluronidase; etorphine, <b>azaperone</b> and 7500 IU hyaluronidase; and 75 % of the original etorphine dose, 75 % of the original <b>azaperone</b> dose and 7500 IU hyaluronidase. Each animal was immobilized with each of the above four drug combinations randomly over an eight week period with a two week interval between each period. The times to first effect, first down and immobilization were recorded. The etorphine and <b>azaperone</b> treatment group was used as the control group. The difference in time to first effect between the control group and the etorphine, <b>azaperone</b> and 7500 IU hyaluronidase treatment group was statistically significant (95 seconds versus 67 seconds; p = 0. 007). When compared to the time to immobilization in the control group (323 seconds) the time to immobilization in the etrophine, <b>azaperone</b> and 5000 IU hyaluronidase (228 seconds); etorphine, <b>azaperone</b> and 7500 IU hyaluronidase (210 seconds) and the low dose etorphine, low dose <b>azaperone</b> and 7500 IU hyaluronidase (268 seconds) groups were statistically significantly reduced (p= 0. 002, p= 0. 001 and p= 0. 045 respectively). It is therefore concluded that the addition of 5000 or 7500 IU hyaluronidase to an etorphine and <b>azaperone</b> combination significantly reduced the time to immobilization in blue wildebeest. The unexpected decrease in time to immobilization in the low dose etorphine, low dose <b>azaperone</b> and 7500 IU hyaluronidase treatment group requires further investigation.

40|$|The {{physiological}} {{effects of}} etorphine, and etorphine combined with xylazine and etorphine combined with <b>azaperone</b> on respiratory and cardiovascular function were determined in. Boer goats. The goats were habituated {{to the experimental}} procedures allowing the determination of respiratory and cardiovascular function while the animals stood quietly at rest. This resulted in the physiological changes induced by the three immobilizing drugs being measured and compared with those obtained prior to {{the administration of the}} immobilizing drugs. The: effectiveness of diprenorphine and atipamezole in antagonising the physiological changes induced by the immobilizing drug treatments was also determined. All three immobilizing drug treatments depressed respiratory function resulting in a decrease in PaO 2 and an increase in PaCO 2. Etorphine caused limited changes to these blood gases as a result of decreases in respiratory minute volume and alveolar minute ventilation caused by a fall in respiratory rate. The administration of etorphine / <b>azaperone</b> did not decrease the efficiency of respiration more significantly than when etorphine was administered on its own. Etorphine injected in combination with xylazine resulted in a severe decrease in respiratory function. The decrease in PaO 2 and the increase in PaCO 2 were much greater than the changes to these two blood gases following the administration of either etorphine or etorphine in combination with <b>azaperone.</b> Compared to etorphine administered on its own, etorphine combined with xylazine caused more significant decreases in tidal volume and alveolar minute ventilation, and more significant elevations in both physiological shunt fraction and percentage dead space ventilation. The administration of etorphine, etorphine / xylazine and etorphine / <b>azaperone</b> caused three different sets of changes to cardiovascular function. The injection of etorphine resulted in significant increases in both total peripheral resistance and systemic mean arterial blood pressure, and a significant decease in cardiac output. The administration of etorphine / xylazine resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in the systemic mean arterial blood pressure, followed by a decrease in cardiac output. The peripheral resistance remained unchanged. Etorphine / <b>azaperone</b> caused a progressive decline in the total peripheral resistance. As the cardiac output did not change significantly, the systemic mean arterial blood pressure fell progressively. The administration of etorphine resulted in a gradual and limited decrease in the oxygen consumption index. Following the injection of etorphine / xylazine a rapid and significant decrease in the oxygen consumption index resulted, which was significantly lower, when compared to the goats immobilized with etorphine, at 5 and 35 minutes PDA. The injection of etorphine / <b>azaperone</b> resulted in a gradual decrease in the oxygen consumption index which reached a minimum value at 35 minutes PDA. At this time, the oxygen consumption index due to etorphine / xylazine was not significantly different from the value due to etorphine / <b>azaperone.</b> Diprenorphine effectively reversed the respiratory and cardiovascular effects due to etorphine. The physiological changes induced by the administration of etorphine / xylazine were partially and temporarily antagonised by the administration of diprenorphine, it was only following the injection of atipamezole that they return to the values measured in the goats prior to immobilization. Diprenorphine effectively reversed the respiratory depression induced by etorphine / <b>azaperone,</b> however a mild acidosis persisted {{until the end of the}} trial period. The cardiac output and systemic mean blood pressure improved dramatically following the injection of diprenorphine but there was no immediate change in total peripheral resistance.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the sedative and antinociceptive effects of three dopaminergic blockers often used in veterinary medicine. The study was conducted on 10 Thoroughbred mares. Sedation was evaluated by determining the spontaneous locomotor activity (SLA) in automated individual behavior stalls and by measuring head ptosis (HP). The intravenous injection of acepromazine (0. 05; 0. 08 and 0. 11 mg/kg) and <b>azaperone</b> (0. 25; 0. 5 and 1. 0 mg/kg) did not induce significant changes on SLA. In contrast, intramuscular injection of levomepromazine caused an increase in SLA at the dosages of 0. 75 and 1. 0 mg/kg, but not at 0. 5 mg/kg. Significant head ptosis occurred with all dosages and drugs. Antinociception was determined utilizing a heat projection lamp to record the hoof withdrawal reflex latency (HWRL) and skin twitch reflex latency (STRL).

40|$|AbstractScientific {{assessment}} of affective states in animals is challenging but vital for animal welfare studies. One possible approach is Qualitative Behavioural Assessment (QBA), a ‘whole animal’ methodology which integrates information from multiple behavioural signals and styles of behavioural expression (body language) directly {{in terms of}} an animal's emotional expression. If QBA provides a valid measure of animals’ emotional state it should distinguish between groups where emotional states have been manipulated. To test this hypothesis, QBA was applied to video-recordings of pigs, following treatment with either saline or the neuroleptic drug <b>Azaperone,</b> in either an open field or elevated plus-maze test. QBA analysis of these recordings was provided by 12 observers, blind to treatment, using a Free Choice Profiling (FCP) methodology. Generalised Procrustes Analysis was used to calculate a consensus profile, consisting of the main dimensions of expression. Dimension one was positively associated with terms such as ‘Confident’ and ‘Curious’ and negatively with ‘Unsure’ and ‘Nervous’. Dimension two ranged from ‘Agitated’/‘Angry’ to ‘Calm’/‘Relaxed’. In both tests, <b>Azaperone</b> pre-treatment was associated with a more positive emotionality (higher scores on dimension one reflecting a more confident/curious behavioural demeanour) than control pigs. No effect of drug treatment on dimension two was found. Relationships between qualitative descriptions of behaviour and quantitative behavioural measures, taken from the same recordings, were found. Overall, this work supports the use of QBA for the {{assessment of}} emotionality in animals...|$|E

During immobilisation, pulse oximeter readings, respiratory rhythm, the plane of immobilisation and plasma cortisol concentrations were measured and recorded. The impala developed an extremely high rise in body temperature, which peaked 20 - 30 min after reversal of the immobilisation. The magnitude of the rise in body temperature was similar for all the drug combinations (F= 0. 8, P= 0. 5), but the duration of the hyperthermia was shorter when the thiafentanil and <b>azaperone</b> combination was used(F= 3. 35, P&lt; 0. 05). Changes in body temperature were related to the time that it took for ananimal to become recumbent after darting (r 2 = 0. 45, P = 0. 006) and not to the effect of the drug combination on time to recumbency (r 2 = 0. 29, P = 0. 46). The relationship between time to recumbency and body temperature change, and also to plasma cortisol concentration(r 2 = 0. 67,P= 0. 008), indicated that physiological consequences of capture were related to the duration of exposure to a stress or, and not to the pharmacology of the capture drugs. Although shorter time to recumbency in individuals resulted in the benefit of smaller stress responses and body temperature changes, those individuals were predisposed to developing hypoxia and possibly induction apnoea.

Eighteen rhinoceros were intubated using an equine nasogastric tube passed nasally into the trachea and monitored before and after tracheal insufflation with oxygen. Seven rhinoceros were not intubated or insufflated with oxygen and served as controls. All anaesthetised rhinoceros were initially hypoxaemic (percentage arterial haemoglobin oxygen saturation (% O 2 Sa) = 49 % + 16 (mean + SD) and PaO 2 = 4. 666 + 1. 200 kPa (35 + 9 mm Hg)), hypercapnic (PaCO 2 = 8. 265 + 1. 600 kPa (62 + 12 mm Hg)) and acidaemic (pHa = 7. 171 + 0. 073).

40|$|SUMMARY Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in a 55 ‐sow, specific pathogen free commercial unit, to assess {{the effects of the}} tranquilising drug, <b>azaperone,</b> on pigs mixed at weaning. The drug is claimed to inhibit aggression in pigs mixed at weaning, and also to increase the average weight gain in groups of growing pigs. The first experiment used a single test and control group, and the second experiment was a 2 times 2 factorial design, the variables being {{the presence or absence of}} the drug, and the presence or absence of a box used to modify the weaner pen environment. In both experiments there were no significant differences in rates of agonistic interactions between treated and untreated groups, although the drug delayed the first agonistic encounters for about 8 hours. Nor was there any difference in the relative growth rate between treated and untreated groups in either experiment. Copyrigh...|$|E
40|$|When immobilising wildlife, adverse {{side effects}} can include hypoxaemia, {{acidosis}} and hypertension. Pulmonary gas exchange and acid–base status were evaluated during immobilisation of 25 free-ranging and one boma-held black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) in Zimbabwe. The effect of different body positions on arterial oxygenation was evaluated. A {{combination of the}} following drugs was used: an opioid (etorphine or thiafentanil), <b>azaperone</b> and an a 2 -adrenoceptor agonist (detomidine or xylazine). Respiratory and heart rates, rectal temperature and pulse oximetry–derived haemoglobin oxygen saturation were recorded. Serial arterial blood samples were analysed immediately in the field. Marked hypoxaemia and hypercapnia were recorded in immobilised free-ranging black rhinoceroses. Arterial oxygenation was higher during sternal compared to lateral recumbency. Most rhinoceroses developed acidaemia of respiratory and metabolic origin. Initially high lactate concentrations in free-ranging rhinoceroses decreased during immobilisation. Pulse oximetry was unreliable in the detection of hypoxaemia. Positioning in sternal recumbency and routine use of oxygen supplementation are recommended {{in the management of}} immobilised rhinoceroses as measures to improve arterial oxygenation...|$|E

40|$|This randomized, prospective, {{blinded study}} {{compared}} {{the use of}} succinylcholine or rocuronium to aid endotracheal intubation of 27 adult sows [mean body weight 261 ± 28 (standard deviation) kg]. Preliminary trials allowed development of the intubation technique and skills. The sows were premedicated with <b>azaperone,</b> atropine, and morphine, and anesthesia was induced with thiopental [6 mg/kg body weight (BW) ]. Nine sows each received succinylcholine (1. 0 mg/kg BW), rocuronium (0. 5 mg/kg BW), or saline (15 mL) after induction. Increments of thiopental (1 mg/kg BW) were used if swallowing impaired intubation. Intubation was performed 45 s after injection of the test drug and was timed and scored. The intubation scores were analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA). Time taken for intubation, body weight, and total dose of thiopental were analyzed with ANOVA and Bonferroni’s multiple-comparisons test. No significant differences (at P < 0. 05) {{were found between the}} groups with regard to intubation score, time taken for intubation, or total thiopental dose.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the practical implementation of the painless castration under injection anaesthesia in Switzerland. 30 swine farms were visited and 60 farmers answered a questionnaire. 34 % of the piglets showed movements during castration under injection anaesthesia and 17 % had excitations during recovery from anaesthesia. After 48 minutes half of the piglets were in sternal position and after 112 minutes half of them showed coordinated movements. The body temperature decreased by 3. 1 °C until 60 minutes after castration, especially small piglets reached critical temperature levels. 38 % of the piglets showed strong bleeding after castration. The healing of the wound was good according to 82 % of the farmers. 83 % of the farmers reported piglet losses, especially at the beginning of the anaesthesia period. The anaesthesia may be improved by using butorphanol in addition to the combination of ketamine and <b>azaperone.</b> The recovery of the piglets should be in a warm place without any risk of injury by obstacles or the sow.

40|$|Foi descrita a hemi-ovariossalpingohisterectomia em cinco pacas prenhes mantidas em cativeiro no Setor de Animais Silvestres da Faculdade de Ciências Agrárias e Veterinárias (FCAV-UNESP) de Jaboticabal, São Paulo, Brasil, a fim de observar futura prenhez no corno restante. A tranqüilização foi obtida após aplicação de <b>azaperone</b> (4 mg/kg) seguida da aplicação de sulfato de atropina (0, 06 mg/kg) e da associação de cloridrato de quetamina (20 mg/kg) e cloridrato de xilazina (1, 5 mg/kg), ambos na mesma seringa, para indução da anestesia. A anestesia geral foi obtida mediante inalação de halotano por máscara. Por meio de laparotomia mediana, foram retirados o corno uterino prenhe, o ovário e a tuba uterina, todos do mesmo antímero. Antibióticos (30. 000 UI/kg de três penicilinas e 12, 5 mg/kg de duas estreptomicinas) e analgésico (0, 02 mg/kg de buprenorfina) foram aplicados imediatamente após a cirurgia, sendo repetidos após dois dias. Todas as aplicações foram feitas por via intramuscular. Apesar da permanência de apenas um ovário após a cirurgia, nova prenhez ocorreu no corno restante nas cinco fêmeas submetidas à cirurgia, com o nascimento de filhotes (apenas um por parto) após 215, 248, 276, 302 e 310 dias da hemi-ovariossalpingohisterectomia. The hemiovarysalpingohysterectomy in five captive {{pregnant}} pacas {{kept on the}} Wild Animal Section at the College of Agricultural and Veterinarian Sciences (FCAV-UNESP) in Jaboticabal, São Paulo, Brazil, {{was conducted}} aiming at verifying the further occurrence of pregnancy on the remaining uterine horn. The tranquilization was achieved by using <b>azaperone</b> (4 mg/kg) and consequent application of atropine sulphate (0. 06 mg/kg) and the association of ketamine (20 mg/kg) and xylazine (1. 5 mg/kg) cloridrates, on the same syringe, for induction of anesthesia. The general anesthesia was performed via a face mask with halothane. By means of median laparotomy, the uterine horn with the fetus, the ovary and the uterine tube, all from the same antimere, were taken out. Antibiotics (30, 000 IU/kg of three penicillins and 12. 5 mg/kg of two streptomycins) and analgesic (buprenorfine 0. 02 mg/kg) were injected immediately after surgery and repeated after two days. All injections were made intramuscularly. In spite of the permanence of only one ovary after surgery, new pregnancy occurred in the remaining uterine horn in the five females which went through surgery, and the birth (solely one by delivery) happened 210, 248, 276, 302 and 310 days after the hemiovarysalpingohysterectomy...|$|E
30|$|Before the experiments, pigs were fasted for 12  h {{with free}} access to water. Intramuscular {{premedication}} consisted of 2.5  mg atropine and 5  mg kg− 1 <b>azaperone.</b> After establishment of an intravenous access via the ear vein, anaesthesia was induced with propofol (1 – 2  mg kg− 1) and ketamine (1 – 2  mg kg− 1). The pigs were endotracheally intubated, and their lungs were mechanically ventilated (tidal volume 8  ml/kg, respiratory rate 8 – 12 adapted to achieve an arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2) of 35 – 45  mmHg, inspiratory/expiratory (I/E) ratio 1 : 1.5, fraction of inspiratory oxygen (FiO 2) 35  %, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 10  cm H 2 O, peak airway pressure ≤ 40  mmHg). Anaesthesia was maintained with continuous intravenous infusion of pentobarbitone (8 – 12  mg kg− 1  h− 1). Buprenorphine was used for analgesia (30  μg kg− 1 initially, further 10  μg kg− 1 every 8  h as well as prior to surgery and induction of faecal peritonitis). Pancuronium (0.1  mg kg− 1  h− 1) ensured appropriate muscle relaxation. Ringer’s solution (10  ml kg− 1  h− 1) was infused for fluid homeostasis.|$|E
40|$|Abstract We immobilized 47 white {{rhinoceroses}} (Ceratotherium simum) for dehorning with 1 - 4  mg of etorphine HCl, 10 - 40  mg of <b>azaperone,</b> and 7, 500  IU of hyaluronidase, at a game {{ranch in}} South Africa in November 2012. Forty-four received butorphanol intravenously 5  min after recumbency, {{at the rate}} of 10  mg of butorphanol per 1  mg of etorphine, and three animals did not. When possible, blood gas and physiologic parameters were measured immediately before butorphanol administration and 10  min later. Statistically significant improvements were observed, with a reduction in pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure, and with an increase in arterial partial pressure of oxygen, arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate in animals administered butorphanol. In the three animals that did not receive butorphanol, no improvement was apparent. Butorphanol given to recumbent white rhinoceroses immediately after immobilization was associated with improved blood gas values and cardiopulmonary function for at least 10  min. Studies on the sustainability of these effects are necessary. Wayne S. J. Boardman, Charles G. B. Caraguel, Jacobus P. Raath, and Martine Van Zijll Langhou...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of small Aβ 42 oligomers has been implicated as a toxic species in Alzheimer disease (AD). In strong {{support of this}} hypothesis we found that overexpression of Yap 1802, the yeast ortholog of the human AD risk factor, phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), reduced oligomerization of Aβ 42 fused to a reporter in yeast. Thus we used the Aβ 42 -reporter system to identify drugs that could be developed into therapies that prevent or arrest AD. From a screen of 1, 200 FDA approved drugs and drug-like small compounds we identified 7 drugs that reduce Aβ 42 oligomerization in yeast: 3 antipsychotics (bromperidol, haloperidol and <b>azaperone),</b> 2 anesthetics (pramoxine HCl and dyclonine HCl), tamoxifen citrate, and minocycline HCl. Also, all 7 drugs caused Aβ 42 to be less toxic to PC 12 cells and to relieve toxicity of another yeast AD model in which Aβ 42 aggregates targeted to the secretory pathway are toxic. Our results identify drugs that inhibit Aβ 42 oligomers from forming in yeast. It remains to be determined if these drugs inhibit Aβ 42 oligomerization in mammals and could be developed as a therapeutic treatment for AD...|$|E
