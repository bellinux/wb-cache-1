"You Can't Win" [...] was {{originally}} written and performed during the pre-Broadway Baltimore {{run of the}} stage version of The Wiz in 1974, sung by the chorus of Winkies, the Wicked Witch's slaves.

[...] "You Can't Win" [...] opens with the lines, [...] "You can't win, you can't break even, and you can't get out of the game.

5000|$|When {{asked why}} she {{wanted to write a}} Star Trek novel, Scott commented, [...] "Partly, I think, it's the simple fact that when you {{encounter}} a world and characters that you enjoy, {{you want to be a}} part of it, too. In a TV series, that temptation is particularly strong, because, after all, it is a series. There <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>who</b> contribute the stories, create the world, and there's always the possibility that you can become one of them. In my case, because I came to Trek from the Blish novelizations, and was acutely conscious of how the written versions compared to the actual episodes, the idea of writing not screenplays but novels was very appealing. Plus, of course, I'm a better novelist than I am a screenwriter!" ...|$|E

5000|$|The film {{alleges that}} many {{scientists}} and the scientific enterprise are dogmatically committed to atheism, and that a commitment to materialism in the scientific establishment is behind the claimed suppression of intelligent design. William A.

That was something that was kind of always on my mind, knowing that there <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>who</b> fell for someone like Donald Trump, who were conned by him, and that these are people just like you and me.
