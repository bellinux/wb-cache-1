40|$|A student casually {{states that}} he is going to the library to do some {{research}} when he is simply going there to read and retrieve a few documents. Find-ing and reading written materials by themselves are not research. A businessperson claims to be doing action research when in fact she is simply solving a difficult workplace problem. Solving a problem by itself is not research. A professor directs a brainstorming session and then helps the group to classify its ideas as well as choose the best option. Generating new ideas or hypotheses is not by itself research. The successful executive or sports coach writes a book on leadership to expound on his personal theory of leadership. Personal theories by them-selves do not qualify as sound theory. A mortgage banker who can efficiently and accurately complete mortgage transactions is deemed by his colleagues as an expert. Because a person can <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>well</b> <b>does</b> not constitute expertise. This article is primarily about the disservice caused by the misuse of the ideas of theory and research. I have equal concern about misuse of the idea of expertise and the essential roles that knowledge and experience play in developing and maintaining expertise. Human expertise is defined as “displayed behavior within a specialized domain or a related in the form of consistently demonstrated actions of an individual that are both optimally efficient and in their execution and effec-tive in their results ” (Herling, 2000, p. 20). Bereiter and Scardmalia (1993) informed us that a distinguishing component of expertise is the propensity of individuals to solve problems.

25|$|Several design {{elements}} {{are needed to}} enable organizational reward systems to operate successfully. First, for a collective assessment to be appropriate for individual team members, the group's tasks must be highly interdependent. If {{this is not the}} case, individual assessment is more appropriate than team assessment. Second, individual-level reward systems and team-level reward systems must be compatible. For example, it would be unfair to reward the entire team for <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>well</b> <b>done</b> if only one team member did most of the work. That team member would most likely view teams and teamwork negatively, and would not want to work on a team in the future. Third, an organizational culture must be created such that it supports and rewards employees who believe in the value of teamwork and who maintain a positive attitude towards team-based rewards.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Industrial Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. In {{the past}} {{fourteen}} years, South African business {{has experienced a}} period of significant transformation. The absorption of previously disadvantaged employees into higher skilled jobs is being nudged by measures such as employment equity legislation and affirmative action. Even though previously excluded {{racial and ethnic groups}} are being empowered and incorporated into management structures, overall progress has been slow. The research organisation seems to be a microcosm of the macro-environment with regard to the advancement of previously disadvantaged employees, consisting primarily of white employees (66 %). Designated employees are represented in much smaller numbers: Indian (15 %), African (15 %) and Coloured (4 %). The objective of this research was to gain an understanding of how designated employees experience working in a predominantly white business unit. Applying a qualitative research design, anecdote circles were used to facilitate the informal sharing of experiences amongst peers. Twelve individuals partook in the anecdote circles and 59 anecdotes were gathered. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to extract themes. Thirty-two themes were identified in the anecdotes that were grouped into seven super-ordinate themes: A debilitating organisational culture; A constructive work environment; Poor orientation and integration into the business unit; Demanding consultant role; Dissatisfaction with careers: Difficulty in handling the typical demanding client profile and Involved management style. Results indicate that designated employees find the organisational culture restrictive due to the bureaucratic nature of the organisation, the insensitivity towards cultural differences, the impersonal atmosphere in the organisation; the excessive use of acronyms; poor communication and ineffective support structures. In contrast they have a positive view of their work environment which is seen as flexible, with plenty opportunities for development and high standards of work. Good teamwork exists with designated employees receiving a lot of support from their project team members. Results show that designated employees experience poor orientation in the business unit, which results in a lack of knowledge regarding processes, tools, and ideal behaviour. They are left to find this information out for themselves and this leads to poor integration into the business unit. Designated employees find their role as consultant very demanding. They experience {{a lot of pressure on}} projects and are concerned about others' impression of them. They feel empowered in certain areas of their work life and enjoy taking responsibility for their work and development. Designated employees are dissatisfied with the direction that their careers are taking and feel frustrated by the lack of career advancement. They do not believe their managers have the power to address their concerns regarding their career. Furthermore they equate career progression with financial gain and this adds to their frustration regarding their careers. Designated employees are struggling to deal with difficult and demanding clients who neglect responsibilities and can be unreasonable. They admit that they are not sure how to handle these clients. Designated employees are satisfied with the level of interaction with their managers and the recognition they receive when <b>a</b> <b>job</b> is <b>well</b> <b>done.</b> Some indicate that they would prefer more guidance and support from their managers and they stress the importance of performance management and providing regular feedback.

2500|$|Two {{days after}} the {{commencement}} of the Operation Barbarossa (Hitler's attack on his own ally, the Soviet Union), Braemer was appointed the [...] or supreme military commander of the so-called Reichskommissariat Ostland, a Nazi régime established in the combined occupied territory of the Baltic states, parts of northeastern Poland and western ByeloRussia, headquartered in Riga, the capital of Latvia (again in the general region of his birth, 380km to the north-east of his native Königsberg). He was to hold this office {{during the period of}} about 2years and 10months between 24June 1941 and 20April 1944. In some reports his appointment to this post was already finalized in the planning stages on 27May 1941. In this capacity Braemer was heavily implicated in the mass murder of the Jewish population in the territories under his command. He was responsible for, among other things, promulgating legislation that laid the legal and operational groundwork on the basis of which whole Jewish communities numbering thousands of people were exterminated in the Holocaust. Thus for example, on 25September 1941 Braemer issued his [...] "Guidelines for Military Security and Maintenance of Quiet and Order" [...] which specifically stipulated the [...] "imperative elimination" [...] of, among others, [...] "Jews and philosemitic elements (judenfreundliche Kreise)". The pivotal role that Braemer played in the Holocaust of the Jewish populations in Byelorussia has been described by the German historian Hannes Heer. Braemer has been shown to possess the notorious distinction of having originated the first annihilation operations against the Jewish ghettos in ByeloRussia: the Smilavichy ghetto, whose 1,338 inhabitants were murdered on 14October 1941; the Koidanovo ghetto, with its 1,000 victims on 21October 1941; followed by the murder of 5,900 people in the predominantly Jewish town of Slutsk on 27 and 28October 1941 in a massacre sometimes euphemistically referred to as the [...] "Slutsk Affair" [...] and that just to begin with. Braemer's service in the Ostland was considered so meritorious by both the Wehrmacht and the SS that he was rewarded with two military promotions, viz., to Generalleutnant (a rank roughly corresponding to major-general) on 1July 1941, just a week after arrival, and later, 14months into his tour of duty, on 1September 1942, as a reward for <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>well</b> <b>done,</b> to General der Kavallerie z.v. ("general of the cavalry", the second-highest general officer rank roughly equivalent to lieutenant general, a [...] "prestigious" [...] cachet within the echelons of the German military); and then again {{on the last day of}} his assignment with an SS promotion to the rank of Gruppenführer, the third-highest SS rank overall. Goebbels went so far as to discuss Braemer's [...] "political ideas" [...] in his diaries (entry for 24November 1941).|$|E

Yet one has only to see these men and talk with them to be convinced of the truth that human happiness and even human health thanks to modern science--are not dependent upon an existence in a Garden of Eden.

They were frequently under fire--when they brought back the wounded or fetched car-loads of munitions to the great guns on the ridiculous little trains of flat cars with open-work wheels, which they named--with American humour--the Federal Express and the Twentieth Century Limited. And their officers were equally happy. Their colonel, of our regular Army Engineer Corps, was one of those broad-shouldered six-footers who, when they walk the streets of Paris, compel pedestrians to turn admiringly and give one a new pride in the manhood of our nation. Hospitably he drew us out of the wind and rain into his little hut, and sat us down beside the stove, cheerfully informing us that, only the night before, the gale had blown his door in, and his roof had started for the German lines. In a neighbouring hut, reached by a duck board, we had lunch with him and his officers baked beans and pickles, cakes and maple syrup. The American food, the American jokes and voices in that environment seemed strange indeed! But as we smoked and chatted about the friends we had in common, about political events at home and the changes that were taking place there, it seemed as if we were in America once more. The English officer listened and smiled in sympathy, and he remarked, after our reluctant departure, that America was an extraordinary land.|$|E
