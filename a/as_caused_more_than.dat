I NTRODUCT I ON Hearing protection devices (HPDs), especially earplugs, are a widely-used method of reducing the harmful effects of noise exposure. Unfortunate 1 y, workers who must use earplugs sometimes complain of discomfort, caused by the stretching of the ear canal or the hardness of the earplug material (Berger, 1982). Industrial hearing audiometrists, OSHA inspectors, and industrial nurses) typically identify general discomfort as a major problem associated with earplugs (Royster and Holder, 1981). Quite simply, if earplugs cause discomfort, workers may wear them incorrectly or not at all, thereby eliminating o r reducing the potential protective benefit. Even though the earplug discomfort issue is prominent, very little research has been aimed at evaluating discomfort associated with earplugs or other types of HPDs (Flugrath and Tuberville, 1972; Damongeot, et al, 1981).

Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the outcome and aftermath of RTI in those who were injured and hospitalized due to a traffic accident. Methods : In the present retrospective cohort study with a one-year follow-up, data were extracted from the profiles of the RTI hospitalized patients. Outcome of the patients was evaluated at the time of discharge and 1 -year later including their living state, presence of a disability or complete recovery. Results : 1471 patients were studied (mean age of 32. 8 ± 17. 0; 80. 3 % male). 571 (38. 8 %) had mild disability, 684 (46. 5 %) moderate disability, and 85 (5. 8 %) had severe disability at the time of discharge. In the end, 53 (3. 6 %) died. In the 1 -year follow-up, 194 (13. 2 %) had mild disability, 43 (2. 9 %) had moderate disability, 9 (0. 6 %) had severe disability, and 7 (0. 5 %) were in a vegetative state. Presence of an underlying disease (p= 0. 03), loss of consciousness for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 24 hours (p= 0. 04), spinal injury (p= 0. 002), presence of multiple trauma (p= 0. 01), increased ISS (p< 0. 001), need for ventilator (p< 0. 001), and organ injuries during hospitalization (p< 0. 001) are independent factors that increase the risk of poor outcome in RTI patients. Conclusion:  Based on {{the results of the present}} study, underlying illnesses, loss of consciousness for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 24 hours, spinal injury, multiple trauma, increased ISS, need for ventilator, and organ injuries during hospitalization were independent factors that increased the probability of poor outcome in RTI injuries. </p...|$|R

40|$|The figure {{depicts the}} aspects of a {{proposed}} deceleration-limiting design for crash walls {{at the sides of}} racetracks and highways. The proposal is intended to overcome the disadvantages of both rigid barriers and kinetic-energy-absorbing barriers of prior design. Rigid barriers can keep high-speed crashing motor vehicles from leaving roadways and thereby prevent injury to nearby persons and objects, but they can also subject the occupants of the vehicles to deceleration levels high enough to cause injury or death. Kinetic-energy-absorbing barriers of prior design reduce deceleration levels somewhat, but are not designed to soften impacts optimally; moreover, some of them allow debris to bounce back onto roadways or onto roadside areas, and, in cases of glancingly incident vehicles, some of them can trap the vehicles in such a manner <b>as</b> to <b>cause</b> <b>more</b> injury <b>than</b> would occur if the vehicles were allowed to skid along the rigid barriers. The proposed crash walls would (1) allow tangentially impacting vehicles to continue sliding along the racetrack without catching them, (2) catch directly impacting vehicles to prevent them from injuring nearby persons and objects, and (3) absorb kinetic energy in a more nearly optimum way to limit decelerations to levels that human occupants could survive...|$|R

Genetic {{mutations in}} the alternate pathway of complement are well recognized <b>as</b> the <b>cause</b> in <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 60 % of patients affected by this thrombotic microangiopathy. The identification of aHUS as a disease of the alternate pathway of complement enables directed therapeutic intervention both in the acute and chronic setting and may include one {{or all of the}} following: plasma therapy, complement blockade, and liver transplantation. Because aHUS shares many of the presenting characteristics of the other thrombotic microangiopathies, and confirmatory genetic results are not available at the time of presentation, the diagnosis relies heavily on the recognition of a clinical syndrome consistent with the diagnosis in the absence of signs of an alternate cause of thrombotic microangiopathy. Limited understanding of the epidemiology, genetics, and clinical features of aHUS has the potential to delay diagnosis and treatment. To advance our understanding, a more complete characterization of the unique phenotypical features of aHUS is needed. Further studies to identify additional genetic loci for aHUS andmore robust biomarkers of both active and quiescent disease are required.

40|$|According to the 1 991 Annual Report of the Department of Health and Social Services {{of former}} Bophuthatswana, there were 364 {{reported}} malignant conditions found {{in women with}} cancer of the breast and cervix being the most prevalent. What causes great concern is t. he fact that patients present {{for the first time}} at health facilities during advanced stages of these diseases thus making the prognosis poor. Black patients in this study were found to present with cancer of the breast at an earlier age than their white counterparts. In addition to the above named problems, no facility exists for the treatment of cancer in the area of study and patients have to be referred to other areas. It was on the strength of the above observations that the researcher embarked upon this study to establish the effects of the diagnosis cancer and mastectomy on the victims. The aims of the study therefore were: to explore and describe the psycho-social effects of the diagnosis and treatment on Black women; develop guidelines for oncology nurses and doctors to assist with the adaptation of these patients to the diagnosis and treatment; and provide information that could lead to better training of oncology personnel as well as develop a proper support system to facilitate adjustment of the mastectomised patient to the disease and its treatment. Data were collected using the qualitative and quantitative approaches with individual in-depth interviews forming the main strategy. The findings revealed that the diagnosis cancer of the breast was equated with death among all respondents. The mastectomy added more stress for the patient, which was further compounded by chemo- and radiotherapy. The latter was described <b>as</b> <b>causing</b> <b>more</b> pain <b>than</b> the tumour itself.

40|$|Washing laundry {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} housework tasks in the world. Washing machines, performing this task already in many private households, are now responsible for about 2 % of the global electricity consumption. Worldwide, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 840 million domestic washing machines are in use, with an annual consumption exceeding 92 TWh of electricity and 19 billion m 3 of water <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>causing</b> emissions of <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 62 megatons CO 2 eq. In North America, Western Europe and Pacific OECD countries, most households own a washing machine. In these economies standard and label policy programs already addressed and reduced the specific electricity and water consumption of washing machines per wash cycle. Nevertheless, in other world regions, the level of ownership for washing machines is still well below saturation and high growth rates can be observed in developing and newly industrialising countries. As washing machines use water, electricity, chemical substances and process time as resources, also the absolute worldwide resource consumption and emissions of these appliances are still on the rise. Due to different washing habits and practices as well as types of washing machines in different world regions, the specific consumption of resources for doing the laundry is varying to a large extent. On that score, this paper presents an overview of the current situation worldwide as well as respective saving potentials. Bottom-up scenario calculations, carried out for the 11 world regions according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change classification, show that large energy, water and greenhouse gas savings are possible with the "Best Available Technologies" today, and even higher savings will be possible with next generation "Best Not yet Available Technologies". According to model results, these savings are usually also very cost-effective. Following these calculations, it is highly advisable for policymakers world-wide to pay even more attention to improvement options in order to implement ambitious and product-specific policy packages, including minimum performance standards and labelling schemes...|$|R

Preoperative pelvic radiotherapy using a three- or four-field technique and megavoltage photons comprised 45 [*]Gy given in 25 fractions, 1. 8 [*]Gy per fraction, and delivered with escalating doses of oxaliplatin in combination with low-dose LV and 5 FU. Chemotherapy was given synchronously with radiotherapy in weeks 1 and 5. Escalating doses of oxaliplatin (85, 130 and 150 [*]mg[*]m− 2) were given on days 2 and 30, followed by low-dose LV (20 [*]mg[*]m− 2) and 5 FU (350 [*]mg[*]m− 2), both given on days 1 – 5 and 29 – 33. Surgery was performed 6 – 10 weeks later. The MTD was determined <b>as</b> the dose <b>causing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a third of patients to have a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Once the MTD was reached, a further 14 patients were treated at the dose level below the MTD. In all, 32 patients received oxaliplatin at the three dose levels, median age 60 years (range 31 – 79), 24 males and eight females. The MTD was reached at 150 [*]mg[*]m− 2 when four out of six patients experienced DLT. Dose-limiting grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea was reported in two out of six patients at 85 [*]mg[*]m− 2, 5 out of 20 at 130 [*]mg[*]m− 2 and four out of 6 at 150 [*]mg[*]m− 2. Grade 3 neuropathy was reported at 130 [*]mg[*]m− 2 (1 out of 20) and at 150 [*]mg[*]m− 2 (two out of six), and serious haematological toxicity was minimal; one grade 3 anaemia at 150 [*]mg[*]m− 2. In all, 28 out of 32 patients completed all treatments as planned; three had radiotherapy interrupted and three a chemotherapy dose reduction. Four patients did not proceed to surgery due to the presence of metastatic disease (two), unfitness (one) or patient refusal (one). Also, 28 patients underwent surgical resection. Histopathology demonstrated histopathological complete response (pCR) 2 out of 27 (7 %), Tmic 3 out of 27 (11 %), pCR+Tmic 5 out of 27 (19 %), pT 0 – 2 6 out of 27 (22 %) and histologically confirmed clear circumferential resection margins in 22 out of 27 (81 %). Dose-limiting toxicity with oxaliplatin is 150 [*]mg[*]m− 2 given days 2 and 30 when added to the described 5 FU LV and 45 [*]Gy radiation preoperatively. The acceptable toxicity and compliance at 130 [*]mg[*]m− 2 recommend testing this dose in future phase II studies.
