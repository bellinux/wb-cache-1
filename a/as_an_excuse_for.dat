5|$|On August 15, 2011, {{there was}} more {{disruption}} in service at BART stations in downtown San Francisco. The San Francisco Examiner reported that the protests were {{a result of the}} shootings, including that of Oscar Grant. Demonstrations were announced by several activists, which eventually resulted in disruptions to service. The protesters have stated that they did not want their protests to results in closures, and accused the BART police of using the protests <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> disruption. Protesters vowed to continue their protests every Monday until their demands were met.|$|E
25|$|The {{real purpose}} of the EU-3 intervention—to prevent the United States from using Iran's nuclear {{ambition}} <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> military intervention—is never discussed in public.|$|E
25|$|European {{and other}} world leaders have {{expressed}} their {{concerns over the}} situation in Turkey, with many of them warning Erdoğan {{not to use the}} coup attempt <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> crackdown against his opponents.|$|E
6000|$|... "No great distance; {{a little}} party of {{pleasure}} with my officers {{to eat a}} dinner together, to celebrate the honour we had received in being brought into Paris. My officers have worked very hard, and the matter served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> good <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> giving them <b>a</b> little dinner." ...|$|R
60|$|Shelley {{could send}} Eliza away, of course; could have cleared her out long ago if so minded, {{just as he}} had {{previously}} done with a predecessor of hers whom he had first worshipped and then turned against; but perhaps she was useful there <b>as</b> <b>a</b> thin <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> staying away himself.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} one can be <b>excused</b> <b>for</b> having false beliefs when those beliefs are formed either out of ignorance, or by force. Accordingly this paper first details what ignorance is and how exactly it can {{function}} <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>excusing</b> condition <b>for</b> false beliefs. Next the paper specifies what 'forced belief' comes too and argues that force can excuse false beliefs too...|$|R
25|$|While Lord Sugar {{recognized}} that Adam hadn't been feeling too {{good on the}} task, during the first day, Zoe remarked how she wouldn't accept illness <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> not working, not being fully aware of how unwell her teammate was.|$|E
25|$|In Lenin's secret {{letter to}} the Politburo, Lenin {{explains}} that the famine provides an opportunity against the church. Richard Pipes argued that the famine was used politically <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> the Bolshevik leadership to persecute the Orthodox Church, which held significant sway {{over much of the}} peasant populace.|$|E
25|$|Maurice {{was murdered}} on 27 November 602 (some say 23 November). It {{is said that}} the deposed emperor was forced to watch his six sons {{executed}} before he was beheaded himself. Empress Constantina and her three daughters were spared and sent to a monastery. The Persian King Khosrau II used this coup and {{the murder of his}} patron <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> a renewed war against the Empire.|$|E
2500|$|When Germany {{began its}} {{submarine}} campaign against Britain, Wilson had {{warned that the}} US would hold the German government strictly accountable for any violations of American rights. On 1 May he stated that [...] "no warning that an unlawful and inhumane act will be committed" [...] could be accepted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> legitimate <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> that act.|$|R
50|$|Jimmy and Harry {{are called}} back to active service as gunnery sergeants with the 6th Marines where they crash the spy ring. The fast-paced comedy uses the spy plot <b>as</b> merely <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> five musical numbers by Harry Revel {{and a variety of}} comedy sequences, such as barroom brawls over thrown garters, spies and policemen with speech impediments, and jeep, {{motorcycle}} and car chases.|$|R
5000|$|He is {{the creator}} of the journalistic dialectic, [...] "Living with Bill and Rob," [...] an ongoing {{research}} project which explores the link between racism and mental illness and how those both are unflinchingly harnessed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> viable <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> lack of human and community involvement and participation. Choy traversed those manifestations in a roommate situation with the titular subjects.|$|R
25|$|Cham Albanians {{claim the}} {{returning}} of the Greek citizenship, {{as a first}} phase in order to resolve the Cham issue. They are reported not to have as a primary issue the regaining of the properties, but the citizenship, because this is seen by Chams <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> their suffering. They argue that the remove of their citizenship was a collective punishment, when even the Greek courts have charged {{only a minority of}} Chams for alleged crimes. They have asked the Greek government to have a dual citizenship, a policy followed by Greece {{in the case of the}} Greek minority in Albania.|$|E
25|$|In part {{to aid in}} his {{political}} ambitions, Hearst opened newspapers in some other cities, among them Chicago, Los Angeles and Boston. The creation of his Chicago paper was requested by the Democratic National Committee, and Hearst used this <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> Phoebe Hearst to transfer him the necessary start-up funds. By the mid-1920s he had a nationwide string of 28 newspapers, among them the Los Angeles Examiner, the Boston American, the Atlanta Georgian, the Chicago Examiner, the Detroit Times, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, the Washington Times, the Washington Herald, and his flagship, the San Francisco Examiner.|$|E
25|$|Halloween in an American {{style was}} {{imported}} to Sweden during the 1990s, {{and is now}} widely celebrated among children and youth, with another opportunity to collect sweets from neighbours. However, unlike the US it is celebrated {{the same day as}} the Church of Sweden celebrates the All Saints' Day, alla helgons dag, (defined as the Saturday between October 31 and November 6) and is mostly observed by older kids in the later teens <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> having drinking parties. The coincident with All Saints has caused some controversy, since the latter {{is supposed to be a}} solemn remembrance of the dead.|$|E
25|$|The book's second {{central theme}} {{revolves}} around {{the connection between the}} Arab-Jews and the Palestinians. Shenhav's claim is that the Iraqi government's nationalization of the Iraqi Jews' property served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> governmental <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> Israel's keeping of the Palestinian refugees' property following their exodus. Israel could thus argue for an interrelatedness between the two and claim that a population and capital exchange took place.|$|R
50|$|Scholar Walter Kolarz {{alleges that}} the {{deportation}} and liquidation of Crimean Tatars <b>as</b> <b>a</b> nation in 1944 {{was just the}} final act of a centuries long process of Russian colonisation of Crimea, which started already in 1783. Gregory Dufaud regards the Soviet accusations against Crimean Tatars <b>as</b> <b>a</b> convenient <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> their forcible transfer through which Moscow secured an unrivaled access to the geostrategic, southern Black Sea {{on one hand and}} eliminated hypothetical rebellious nations at the same time.|$|R
50|$|Justinian {{immediately}} reacted {{by offering}} his {{support to the}} deposed queen, but in early May 535, she was executed. This crime served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> perfect <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> Justinian, fresh from his forces victory over the Vandals, to invade the Gothic realm in retaliation. Theodahad tried to prevent the war, sending his envoys to Constantinople, but Justinian was already resolved to reclaim Italy. Only by renouncing his throne in the Empires favour could Theodahad hope to avert war.|$|R
25|$|In 1869 a European missionary {{family was}} taken to Kumasi. They were hospitably welcomed and were used <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> war in 1873. Also, Britain took control of Ashanti land claimed by the Dutch. The Ashanti invaded the new British protectorate. General Wolseley and his famous Wolseley ring were sent against the Ashanti. This was a modern war, replete with press {{coverage}} (including by the renowned reporter Henry Morton Stanley) and printed precise military and medical instructions to the troops. The British government refused appeals to interfere with British armaments manufacturers who were unrestrained in selling to both sides.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Ungdomshuset was {{ravaged by}} fire {{destroying}} {{much of the}} interior. The city council used this opportunity <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> closing down the house claiming that the building were no longer fit for human use. But the users {{were not going to}} let that happen. They started renovating the house themselves and after six months the house was reopened for the public. The city counsel protested about this but after the city building inspectors had inspected the house they found the house in an even better state of repair than before the fire. The city counsel then had to withdraw their protest.|$|E
25|$|On 9 March 2015, a {{group led}} by Amin Pathan moved a no-confidence motion against Lalit Modi, who was until then, the President of RCA. According to the Rajasthan State Sports Act, a minimum {{attendance}} of 23 was required to make a quorum. 23 people attended the meeting, out of whom 17 voted against Modi. Only one vote in Modi's support was counted: five other votes were discarded as disputed. 12 more of Modi's supporters were denied entry into the meeting, {{on the ground that}} they were late by 10 minutes. The delay occurred because their vehicles were stopped, and they were beaten with rods by a mob. 5 more votes were discarded as disputed. In the end, Modi was ousted as the President by a controversial 17–1 vote. Pathan denied any role in the attack on Modi's supporters, and suggested that the attack was staged by them <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> their pending defeat.|$|E
5000|$|Various running jokes are used. [...] "Head Office calling!" [...] means Mrs. Street, who fields {{customer}} {{calls at}} home, is calling Johnny on his mobile phone. The [...] "lady with the boiler on Misperton Avenue" [...] is a fictional customer used <b>as</b> <b>an</b> all-purpose <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> {{not being able}} to take on a job right away (the builders do not want to seem desperate for business) or for making a quick exit from an embarrassing situation.|$|R
60|$|I have {{no doubt}} that he was right, and that I was prejudiced; but as I saw the first oily, vinegary, garlicky morsel slide noiselessly into his mouth, I began to feel rather sick. My hands were dirty with moving the books, and I asked if I could wash them before {{beginning}} to work at the likeness, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> good <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> getting out of the room, while Professor Tizzi was unctuously disposing of his simple vegetable meal.|$|R
50|$|The {{volatile}} {{situation was}} furthered acerbated {{by the actions}} of the King of Poland, Augustus II the Strong. Augustus aimed to transform the weak position of the Polish-Lithuanian monarch into one based on the then current Western (and Russian) model of an absolute monarch. He saw the potential conflict in Lithuania <b>as</b> <b>a</b> possible <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> intervention which could then be utilized to strengthen royal power, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> means of weakening powerful magnate families in the region.|$|R
25|$|Following the IRA {{killing of}} a Royal Irish Constabulary {{sergeant}} outside Bandon church in July 1920, Percival captured Tom Hales, commander of the IRA's West Cork Brigade, and Patrick Harte, the brigade's quartermaster, {{for which he was}} appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). Both prisoners later claimed to have been repeatedly beaten and tortured while in custody. Hales alleged that a pair of pliers had been used on his lower body and to extract his fingernails. Harte suffered brain injury and died in a mental hospital in 1925. The claims of torture were denied by Percival and his colleagues, Hales being unable to produce any visible wounds beyond missing teeth and Harte's head injury being officially recorded as the result of being rifle-butted upon arrest. Ormonde Winter, the head of British Intelligence in Dublin Castle, later named Hales as an informer who had invented the story <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> providing the names of his fellow IRA members in return for a lesser sentence.|$|E
500|$|... "There is a {{conflict}} here between the interests of national security {{on the one hand}} and the freedom of the individual on the other. The balance between these two is not for a court of law. It is for the Home Secretary. He is the person entrusted by Parliament with the task. In some parts of the world national security has on occasions been used <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> all sorts of infringements of individual liberty. But not in England." ...|$|E
500|$|Richard Strauss made {{reference}} to L'incoronazione in the Act III music lesson scene of his 1935 opera, Die schweigsame Frau, completely recomposing the Act 2, Scene 5 duet [...] "Sento un certo non so che" [...] in his own florid and late-Romantic idiom as one of many uses of preexisting musical material to set an appreciably antique atmosphere {{by the standards of}} the time. In that scene, the duet is used <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> the title role to flirt with her husband, in disguise as a singing teacher.|$|E
5000|$|This Convention for the Definition of Aggression, an {{initiative}} of the Soviet Government, defined in Article 2 various acts as aggression, including naval blockades. The Convention also stipulates that [...] "No political, military, economic or other consideration may serve <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> or justification <b>for</b> the aggression referred to in Article 2." ...|$|R
50|$|Recurring {{themes in}} Mason's work include the {{establishment}} of alternative communities that oppose the values of mainstream society; {{the tension between the}} desires of an individual and the priorities of the collective; the ambiguity of religion <b>as</b> both <b>a</b> force that brings meaning, and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> ready <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> oppression and violence; the similarly ambiguous nature of sexuality <b>as</b> <b>a</b> source of affection and sensuality, but also as the site of unequal relationships of power; {{and the use of the}} past <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mirror of the contemporary period.|$|R
5000|$|But, {{adversity}} had {{a bright}} side. On Memorial Day, 1953, a [...] "Monsoon Flood" [...] disrupted Opening Day ceremonies which were underway. The sewer viaduct, which crosses the road {{halfway up the}} ravine road, broke without warning sending tons of mud and debris {{down the road and}} into the parking lot. Those at the Club were trapped by the mudslide. Some left by boat, but many seized the opportunity <b>as</b> <b>a</b> perfect <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> extended Club party. It was two days before cars could get up the hill.|$|R
500|$|For years, Mexican {{authorities}} {{used the}} reconquering of Texas <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> implementing new taxes {{and making the}} army the budgetary priority of the impoverished nation. [...] Only sporadic skirmishes resulted. [...] Larger expeditions were postponed as military funding was consistently diverted to other rebellions, {{out of fear that}} those regions would ally with Texas and further fragment the country. The northern Mexican states, the focus of the Matamoros Expedition, briefly launched an independent Republic of the Rio Grande in 1839. The same year, the Mexican Congress considered a law to declare it treasonous to speak positively of Texas. [...] In June 1843, leaders of the two nations declared an armistice.|$|E
500|$|On {{the first}} day, several delegates {{addressed}} the convention {{to justify the}} recent Texian actions. [...] Many argued that the expulsion of most garrisons in the region was not an act of disloyalty to Mexico, but instead resistance to a particular form of governance. [...] Sam Houston, who represented Nacogdoches, commented that [...] "Santa Anna was only a name used <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> resistance to oppression". [...] Several delegates argued that the recently concluded civil war had left Mexico in too much turmoil to provide effective rule for Texas. [...] Echoing the American Revolution slogan [...] "no taxation without representation", one delegate insisted that Texas was not bound by Mexican laws since its settlers had no representation. [...] This delegate overlooked the fact that Texas had been granted two representatives to the Coahuila y Tejas legislature.|$|E
500|$|The Singapore {{strategy}} was {{the cornerstone of}} British Imperial defence policy in the Far East during the 1920s and 1930s. By 1937, according to Captain Stephen Roskill, [...] "the concept of the 'Main Fleet to Singapore' had, perhaps through constant repetition, assumed something of the inviolability of Holy Writ". A combination of financial, political and practical difficulties ensured {{that it could not}} be successfully implemented. During the 1930s, the strategy came under sustained criticism in Britain and abroad, particularly in Australia, where the Singapore {{strategy was}} used <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> parsimonious defence policies. The strategy ultimately led to the despatch of Force Z to Singapore and the sinking of the Prince of Wales and Repulse by Japanese air attack on 10 December 1941. The subsequent ignominious fall of Singapore was described by Winston Churchill as [...] "the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history".|$|E
5000|$|I am truly {{amazed that}} after all this time, {{religious}} groups still need to attack entertainment and use these tragedies <b>as</b> <b>a</b> pitiful <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> their own self-serving publicity. In response to their protests, I will provide a show where I balance my songs with a wholesome Bible reading. This way, fans will not only hear my so-called, 'violent' point of view, but we can also examine the virtues of wonderful 'Christian' stories of disease, murder, adultery, suicide and child sacrifice. Now that seems like 'entertainment' to me.|$|R
50|$|A sinecure {{can also}} be given to an {{individual}} whose primary job is in another office, but requires a sinecure title to perform that job. For example, the Government House Leader in Canada is often given a sinecure ministry position so {{that he or she}} may {{become a member of the}} Cabinet. Similar examples are the Lord Privy Seal and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in the British cabinet. Other sinecures operate as legal fictions, such as the British office of Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds, used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> legal <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> resigning from Parliament.|$|R
50|$|His sister, Tabitha Bramble, is {{a foolish}} and cantankerous {{spinster}} {{who uses the}} expedition <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> to search <b>for</b> <b>a</b> husband. Through her correspondence with Mrs. Gwyllim, the house-keeper at Brambleton Hall, Tabitha reveals her selfishness and lack of generosity towards servants and the impoverished. Her social pretensions are rendered all the more comical by her frequent misunderstandings, misuse of common idioms and atrocious spelling.|$|R
