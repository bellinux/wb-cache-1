5|$|At {{a hearing}} on May 22, 1990, Judge Brett {{announced}} his refusal to reconsider the seven dismissed claims, ending the lawsuit, and ruled all remaining pending motions moot. At the hearing, Brett said that the issue <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suit was the highway's effect on area residents. While this was a legitimate interest, the judge said, it was {{not covered by the}} environmental laws under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project. Brett also pointed out that the environmental questions were at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city, a royal palace {{was built}} which {{also served as}} a temple. Four {{successive}} architectural levels from the second kingdom's palace have been unearthed (the oldest is designated P3, while the latest is P0), and the last two levels are dated to the Akkadian period. The first two levels were excavated; the findings include a temple named Enceinte Sacrée, which was the largest in the city but it is unknown for whom it was dedicated. Also unearthed were a pillared throne room and a hall that have three double wood pillars leading to the temple.|$|E
5|$|Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne in 1660 and reduced both the size and the wages of the garrisons across the kingdom. The Device Forts initially remained <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defences along the south coast, but their design was by now badly antiquated. Deal continued {{to play an important}} role in defending the Downs during the Second and Third Dutch Wars, supported by local trained bands, and castles such as Hurst, Portland and Sandgate remained garrisoned. Others, however, were decommissioned with Sandsfoot closing in 1665 following a dispute over the control of the defences, and Netley being abandoned to fall into ruin.|$|E

5|$|During the 15th and 16th centuries Framlingham was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> estates of the {{powerful}} Mowbray and Howard families. Two artificial meres were built around the castle, which was expanded in fashionable brick. With a large, wealthy household to maintain, the castle purchased supplies from across England and brought in luxury goods from international markets. Extensive pleasure gardens were built within the castle and older parts redesigned to allow visitors to enjoy the resulting views. By {{the end of the}} 16th century, however, the castle fell into disrepair and after the final Howard owner, Theophilus, entered into financial difficulties the castle and the surrounding estates were sold off.|$|E
5|$|During {{the filming}} of his directorial debut Vandemataram (1939) at Hampi, Bommireddy Narasimha Reddy visited the Virupaksha Temple to capture {{the beauty of the}} monuments, which {{reflected}} the taste and artistic outlook of Krishnadevaraya, king of the Vijayanagara Empire. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temple, Narasimha Reddy felt that he was standing exactly at a place where Krishnadevaraya had once stood and offered prayers to the deity. From that moment, Reddy decided to make a film in which Krishnadevaraya would be the main character, and he began working on the script.|$|E

Here, NY812 joins NY58 northeast along the southern bank of the now-unified Oswegatchie River to the village of Gouverneur, located in the town of the same name, where NY812 leaves NY58 but joins U.S. Route11 (US11) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> community.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, {{the mayor}} of Norfolk had {{proposed}} using funds raised by public contribution to remodel the old Norfolk City Hall as a memorial to General MacArthur and as a repository for his papers, decorations, and mementos he had accepted. Restored and remodeled, the MacArthur Memorial contains nine museum galleries whose contents reflect the general's 50 years of military service. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> memorial is a rotunda.

His last appearance as a pianist was in Berlin in May 1922, playing Beethoven's Emperor Concerto. Amongst his composition pupils in Berlin were Kurt Weill, Wladimir Vogel and Robert Blum, and he also during these last years had contact with Edgard Varèse, Igor Stravinsky, Hermann Scherchen and others.|$|E

5|$|In late 1989, Federal Airports Corporation Inspector A.

Information on the first two categories was provided by Ian Hunter, Wurundjeri researcher, and Ray Gibb, local historian. The project was completed but was shelved, with the only suggested name, Gowrie Park Drive, being allocated, named after the farm <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airport. During the 1920s, the farm had been used as a landing site for aircraft, which were parked at night during World War II in case Essendon Aerodrome was bombed.|$|E

5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{reject the}} idea that Hamlet is in any way connected with Shakespeare's only son, Hamnet Shakespeare, who died in 1596 at age eleven. Conventional wisdom holds that Hamlet is too obviously connected to legend, and the name Hamnet was quite popular at the time. However, Stephen Greenblatt {{has argued that the}} coincidence of the names and Shakespeare's grief for the loss of his son may lie <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tragedy. He notes that the name of Hamnet Sadler, the Stratford neighbour after whom Hamnet was named, was often written as Hamlet Sadler and that, in the loose orthography of the time, the names were virtually interchangeable.|$|E
