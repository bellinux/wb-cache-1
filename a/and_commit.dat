5|$|My {{situation}} is most critical, not from anything the enemy can do, {{but from the}} disposition of the people– The Population, believe me is essentially bad– A full belief possesses them that this Province must inevitably succumb– This Prepossession is fatal to every exertion– Legislators, Magistrates, Militia Officers, all, have imbibed the idea, and are so sluggish and indifferent in all their respective offices that the artful and active scoundrel is allowed to parade the Country without interruption, <b>and</b> <b>commit</b> all imaginable mischief... What a change an additional regiment would make {{in this part of}} the Province! Most of the people have lost all confidence– I however speak loud and look big.|$|E
5|$|Schlesselman and Cowart {{were arrested}} on October 22, 2008, {{and found to}} be in {{possession}} of several weapons. The men told authorities of their planned assassination and killing spree, and said they intended to rob a gun store to obtain additional weapons <b>and</b> <b>commit</b> home robberies to help fund the operation. Although the United States Secret Service said they were taking the plot seriously, authorities were unsure how capable Schlesselman and Cowart were of carrying out the alleged plot. Both plotters pleaded guilty to various federal charges; Judge J. Daniel Breen of the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee sentenced Schlesselman to 10 years imprisonment on April 15, 2010, and Cowart to 14 years in prison on October 22, 2010.|$|E
5|$|On August 7, 1888, {{three days}} after the Lyceum opening of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Martha Tabram was {{discovered}} stabbed to death in London's Whitechapel neighborhood. On August 31 Mary Ann Nichols was found, murdered and mutilated, in the same neighborhood. Press coverage linking these and other Whitechapel murders of women created a furor in London. The public and police suspected that {{some or all of the}} murders were committed by one person, who became known as Jack the Ripper. Some press reports compared the unidentified killer with the Jekyll and Hyde characters, suggesting that the Ripper led a respectable life during the day and became a murderer at night. On October 5, the City of London Police received a letter suggesting that Mansfield should be considered a suspect. The letter writer, who had seen him perform as Jekyll and Hyde, thought that Mansfield could easily disguise himself <b>and</b> <b>commit</b> the murders undetected.|$|E

5|$|The GRC scheme {{has also}} been criticized for raising the bar for the {{opposition}} in elections. First, opposition parties may find it harder to find competent candidates, including minority candidates, to form teams to contest GRCs. Goh Chok Tong has acknowledged that the GRC scheme benefits the PAP as they can put together stronger teams. With the GRC system the threshold for votes for the opposition is also increased, and opposition parties {{have to take a}} gamble <b>and</b> <b>commit</b> huge proportions of their resources to contest GRCs. Each candidate in a GRC is required to deposit a sum equal to 8% of the total allowances payable to an MP in the calendar year preceding the election, rounded to the nearest S$500. At the 2011 general election, the deposit was $16,000. Unsuccessful candidates have their deposits forfeited if they do not receive at least one-eighth {{of the total number of}} votes polled in the GRC. Critics have noted that the number of walkovers has generally increased since the introduction of GRCs. To date, only one opposition party, the Workers' Party, has won a GRC: Aljunied, in the 2011 general election.|$|E
5|$|The run starts by {{introducing}} two main antagonists, an aging politician, who {{is using a}} strange portal to enter other people's minds <b>and</b> <b>commit</b> crimes, and Mako, a cannibalistic mage who devours other magicians {{in order to obtain}} their power. Constantine's attempt to play them off one another only succeeds in making them join forces in a further plot. Constantine then traps them both with considerable ease, and questions how this has been so easy. It then becomes apparent that he has been manipulated by the 'Golden Child', his twin who did not survive childbirth, and has been manipulating events for the whole of the series, including his battle with cancer and many other events. He declines his twin's offer to merge souls, suspicious that his twin has been weakening his will in past years to make him accept this offer, choosing instead to take control of his own destiny.|$|E
