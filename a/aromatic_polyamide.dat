40|$|As {{generally}} accepted, also in {{the case}} of polyamides linear and crosslinked polymeric materials are believed to be characterized by the same solution properties and, consequently, by the same solubility parameters. However, despite their great practical importance, a thorough study aimed to determine the best solvent media able to dissolve linear <b>aromatic</b> <b>polyamides</b> has not been performed yet or, at least, has not been published. In this study, we report on our study on the solubility parameters of linear and crosslinked <b>aromatic</b> <b>polyamides.</b> We demonstrate that the assumption of considering these two classes as having the same solubility properties can lead to dramatically erroneous results.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of perfectly planar, bis-substituted <b>aromatic</b> <b>polyamides</b> is reported herein. With highly flexible triethylene glycol chains attached and conformational restriction through intramolecular, bifurcated hydrogen bonds these {{are among the}} most shape-persistent yet organo-soluble polymers to date. Starting from 4 -nitrosalicylic acid, our group developed a route to phenyl- 2, 5 -bis-TEGylated aminobenzoate, which could be polymerized by addition of lithium bis(trimethylsilyl) amide (LiHMDS). Since this technique has not been applied to step-growth polycondensations of polyaramides so far, the influence of two different solvents and an N-protective group was investigated. Therefore, substituted phenyl aminobenzoate derivatives carrying a free amine or an N-protective group have been polymerized. Additionally, the tendency for self-assembly of the readily soluble bis-TEGylated poly(p-benzamide) was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in the dried state.

40|$|A serious {{limitation}} of most commercial polyamide reverse osmosis (RO) membranes is their sensitivity to chlorine attack. By studying the hypochlorite degradation of <b>aromatic</b> <b>polyamide</b> RO membrane, {{this work was}} to get some understandings {{in the prevention of}} membrane depreciation and develop membranes with improved chlorine resistance. Membrane performances, including water flux and salt rejection, were evaluated before and after hypochlorite exposure under different pH and concentration conditions. The results showed that chlorination destroyed hydrogen bonds in polyamide chains, causing a notable decline of membrane flux especially in acid environment; however, membrane performance was slightly improved after the treatment of alkaline hypochlorite solution for a certain time, which was probably due to the effect of amine groups in barrier layer. Based on the attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) characterizations and performance measurements, the results indicated that N-chlorination reaction of <b>aromatic</b> <b>polyamide</b> was also reversible, ill other words, the N-chlorinated intermediate could be regenerated to initial amide with the alkaline treatment before ring-chlorination reaction. This conclusion provided several relative suggestions for membrane cleaning procedures. Finally, a method adopting surface coating was proposed to develop membranes with good chlorine resistance, and the preliminary results showed its potential for applications. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V.
