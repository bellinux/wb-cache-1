Ngawang Namgyal, 1st Zhabdrung Rinpoche, found {{the peak of the}} hill, which {{appeared}} in the shape of trunk of an elephant as prophesized, <b>and</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> dzong in 1637-38.|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{the medieval}} masonry, Briggs' {{alterations}} {{can still be}} seen today (albeit in ruins). Briggs' son, Colonel Charles James Briggs (father of Sir Charles James Briggs) inherited the castle in 1871 <b>and</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> nearby St Margaret's church (now demolished).|$|E
5|$|Brunel envisaged the GWR {{continuing}} {{across the}} Atlantic Ocean <b>and</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> SS Great Western {{to carry the}} railway's passengers from Bristol to New York. Most traffic for North America soon switched to the larger port of Liverpool (in LNWR territory) but some transatlantic passengers were landed at Plymouth and conveyed to London by special train. Great Western ships linked Great Britain with Ireland, the Channel Islands and France.|$|E

5|$|From the {{northern}} terminus, a tramway connected the canal to iron works at Aberdare and Hirwaun. This {{was built in}} 1803, and included an incline just north of Glynneath, which was powered by a high-pressure Trevithick steam engine. The Tappenden brothers had bought into the iron industry in 1802, <b>and</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> tramway because of high tolls on the Glamorganshire Canal, but by 1814 they were bankrupt, and had no further connections with the canal.|$|E
5|$|John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute, KT, FRS (10 August 1793 – 18 March 1848), styled Lord Mount Stuart between 1794 and 1814, was {{a wealthy}} aristocrat and {{industrialist}} in Georgian and early Victorian Britain.

5|$|The community's Finns {{organized}} a temperance society <b>and</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> Finnish Temperance Hall. The community {{also included a}} band, a volunteer fire department, tennis courts and a clubhouse for employees. A small Methodist church and Presbyterian church were built. The town also had a night watchman and later a full-time patrolman. Always noted as a quiet, orderly town, Elcor managed to avoid the social vagaries of adjacent communities, like Gilbert's red-light district.|$|E

5|$|A {{designer}} named Tateaki Koshiki steps forward, {{claiming he}} developed the Solid State system before committing suicide. Kusanagi dives into his cyberbrain and into Koshiki's trap, allowing him to hack her cyberbrain. The Puppeteer reveals that he was spread across several egos until a collective consciousness emerged and developed into a Solid State, allowing him {{to move into the}} society beyond as the vanishing mediator. Later, Batou tells a recovering Kusanagi that the real Tateaki Koshiki used a cybernetic body <b>and</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> Solid State after he was hired by Munei. Kusanagi does not reveal that the Puppeteer was a fragment of herself, but Batou already knew from being linked to her during the dive. Batou concludes that the ultimate identity of the Puppeteer will remain unknown and that incident will be written off as a scandal.|$|E
5|$|After Elverson's {{death in}} 1911, his son {{by his wife}} Sallie Duvall, James Elverson Jr. took charge. Under Elverson Jr., the {{newspaper}} continued to grow, eventually needing to move again. Elverson Jr. bought land at Broad and Callowhill Streets <b>and</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> eighteen-story Elverson Building, {{now known as the}} Inquirer Building. The first Inquirer issue printed at the building came out on July 13, 1925. Elverson Jr. died a few years later in 1929 and his sister, Eleanor Elverson, Mrs. Jules Patenôtre, took over.|$|E
5|$|At age fifty-eight, Baldwin {{desired to}} satisfy his nature {{of being a}} pioneer again by moving to Kansas, which {{was at that time}} a territory. He arrived as the brunt of the {{fighting}} in the territory was ending. Upon his arrival, he founded Baldwin City <b>and</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> first college building in the territory, which became the foundation for Baker University. He was in Kansas only for a short time when tragedy struck. On August 30, 1858, John's son Milton died unexpectedly after having been sick for only three days. Within a couple years, he laid out a town, built a grist mill and a saw mill, and he turned over the town and college to the Methodist Conference and returned to Berea, although he continued to finance it.|$|E

5|$|Carte {{started his}} career working for his father, Richard Carte, in the music {{publishing}} and musical instrument manufacturing business. As a young man, he conducted and composed music, but he soon turned to promoting the entertainment careers of others through his management agency. Carte believed that a school of wholesome, well-crafted, family-friendly, English comic opera could be as popular as the risqué French works dominating the London musical stage in the 1870s. To that end, he brought together the dramatist W. S. Gilbert and composer Arthur Sullivan and, together with his wife Helen Carte, he nurtured their collaboration {{on a series of}} thirteen Savoy operas. He founded the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company <b>and</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> state-of-the-art Savoy Theatre to host the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.|$|E
5|$|Colt {{purchased}} a large {{tract of land}} beside the Connecticut River, where he built his first factory in 1848, a larger factory called the Colt Armory in 1855, a manor that he called Armsmear in 1856, and employee tenement housing. He established a ten-hour day for employees, installed washing stations in the factory, mandated a one-hour lunch break, <b>and</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> Charter Oak Hall, where employees could enjoy games, newspapers, and discussion rooms. Colt ran his plant with a military-like discipline, he would fire workers for tardiness, sub-par work or even suggesting improvements to his designs.|$|E
5|$|Conrad rebuilt and {{expanded}} Salzburg Cathedral <b>and</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> cathedral chapter house, and in 1140 {{he created the}} cathedral cemetery. He built hospitals for the poor of the city, and commenced construction of St. Peter's monastery where his former residence stood, moving to a new archbishop's residence nearer the cathedral. Conrad founded several monasteries and reformed others, a total of 17 in which {{the rule of the}} Augustinian Canons Regular prevailed. These included St. Zeno, Gurk, Reichersberg, Berchtesgaden, Baumburg, Gars am Inn, Au am Inn, Ranshofen, Höglwörth, Herrenchiemsee, Seckau and Suben. The archbishop supported the Benedictines.|$|E

5|$|Cynesige {{expanded}} and embellished York Minster and other churches in his archdiocese, <b>and</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> tower at Beverley, {{as well as}} giving books and other items to the church there. He consecrated Herewald as Bishop of Llandaff at a council held at London in 1056, although this information is only attested in the Book of Llandaff, a sometimes unreliable source. In 1059 he, along with Earl Tostig and Æthelwine Bishop of Durham, escorted King Malcolm III of Scotland to King Edward's court at Gloucester when Malcolm came south, probably to thank Edward for his help in restoring Malcolm to the Scottish throne, and perhaps to acknowledge the English king as Malcolm's lord.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{has shown}} a number of fish traps exist around the island, which date from around the 7th century. The Anglo-Saxons {{established}} a large fish weir at Besom Fleet to the southwest of the island <b>and</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> church at West Mersea. It was damaged by Norse raiders in 894 and rebuilt afterwards. The west tower {{was added to the}} church around the 11th century, the south aisle in the 15th and various other rebuilds continued {{towards the end of the}} 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Examination of the {{wreckage}} revealed that large portions of the wings' skin were badly glued and {{that a number of}} rib caps and stringers were not glued at all. Many panel pins were not connected to the structure at all and many of the bradawl holes necessary to equalize pressure between the inside of the wing and the outside were missing entirely. The crash of such an advanced aircraft shocked the entire industry and caused a six-month hiatus in design work. Polikarpov overreacted to its loss <b>and</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> structure of a number of his subsequent aircraft stronger, and thus, heavier, than it needed to be. All further work on the project was abandoned following the crash, nominally for lack of a suitable engine.|$|E
