With this classification, the hypothesis propounding that “The national accounting organizations in highly corrupt countries would be less likely to adopt the IFAC ethic code than those in very clean countries,” is tested using the “Corruption Perception Index-CPI” data.

40|$|There is an {{underlying}} partnership agreement in cooperatives that {{makes use of}} accounting regulations to determine the results. This can indirectly lead to a modification in the organization that was originally planned. Therefore, we should start with accounting regulations when legislating on cooperatives, and more so nowadays, as we must {{bear in mind the}} current situation with regard to accounting regulations, which is characterized by international harmonization. Accounting regulations can no longer be considered a mere documentary appendix to the regulations governing corporations, which are conditioned by the latter. This paper therefore aims to identify the most important areas (as well as classifying share capital contributions as financial assets or liabilities) in the economic organization of cooperatives that can be affected by International Financial Reporting Standards (hereafter referred to as IFRS) as their criteria become part of Spain’s corporate and <b>accounting</b> <b>code,</b> beyond the obligatory cases where IFRS must be applied (consolidated accounts of listed companies). The purpose of this is to serve as a basis for future legislative reforms relating to cooperatives in order to improve their economic organization on the one hand, {{and on the other hand}} to adapt it to the aforementioned new corporate and accounting regulations resulting from their adaptation to the current European accounting regulations adopted by IFRS. In this regard, we must bear in mind the constitutional mandate to promote cooperatives by introducing suitable legislation.

40|$|The {{history of}} Brazilian {{accounting}} {{has not been}} explored at length. Through a historical survey, this article presents {{the history of the}} Double-entry Bookkeeping Committee of 1914. After the Proclamation of the Republic was announced in 1889, the government started to expand its administrative bodies, necessitating the introduction of a bureaucracy able to perform new functions. In the same period, Brazil experienced a strong economic development with the development of its coffee industry. In 1905, under the leadership of Carlos de Carvalho, São Paulo State Treasury bookkeeping tasks were introduced under a double-entry bookkeeping system and through accrual and financial accounting. Double-entry bookkeeping practices in the federal public accounting system, although enshrined in law since 1808, were only fully realized after the creation of the Double-entry Bookkeeping Committee in 1914. In that same year, due to the negotiation of a second funding loan, English creditor bank auditors requested a balance of the National Treasury from the Minister of Finance Rivadávia Corrêa. Because the balance had not been prepared in eight years, the Double-entry Bookkeeping Committee was established in June of 1914, and this body completed a technical audit of Revenues and Expenditures. The committee also conducted the state administration's first Asset and Liability audit since the colonial era. The Double-entry Bookkeeping Committee of 1914 spearheaded changes to the Brazilian public accounting system, including the creation of the Public <b>Accounting</b> <b>Code</b> in 1922 and the approval of Central Accounting Office of the Republic regulation in 1924, strengthening and ascribing perpetuity to practices adopted after 1914...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{applies the}} impression management theory of exemplification in an accounting study by identifying and measuring differences in both auditor and public perceptions of exemplary behaviors. The auditors {{were divided into}} two groups, one of which reported self-perceptions (A-S) while the other group reported their perceptions of a typical auditor (A-O). There were two separate public groups, which gave their perceptions of a typical auditor and were divided based on their levels of accounting sophistication. The more sophisticated public group was comprised of bank loan officers (LO) while the less sophisticated public group consisted of investment club members (IC). Comparisons were made on 30 behaviors contained in the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct, which served {{as the basis for the}} research instrument. Profile analysis, a special form of MANOVA technique, was used to analyze the results. A-S perceptions were the highest of the four treatment levels and were significantly higher (i. e., more exemplary) than the perceptions of both the A-O and LO groups. The more sophisticated user group (LO) provided the lowest perceptions of the four treatment levels. For at least four of the six measures, the LO treatment group perceived the typical auditor to be less exemplary than both the IC and A-O treatments. There were no differences in perceptions between the A-O group and IC. Additional analysis revealed that auditors overrated the degree to which the public relied on financial statements. However, both public groups reported a reasonably high level of reliance on financial statements when making decisions.

The research method used in this study is qualitative and descriptive case studies. Qualitative methods are research methods that explain the circumstances of a phenomenon or event by using the description of the sentence. Based on survey results revealed that the company has not applied the accounting system of accountability, this can be seen from the organizational structure which does not list the <b>account</b> <b>code</b> for each part of the organization, preparing a budget that is less in accordance with the rules of preparation of the budget in the form of statements of responsibility, and there is no cost grouping.
