30|$|Despite the {{observed}} advances, existing solutions {{do not address}} localized fluctuation and bottleneck scenarios that occur due to variations in the volume of flows in transit in the network. An ad hoc strategy {{to deal with these}} fluctuations is to re-execute VNF allocation algorithms, and to rearrange them according to the results obtained. Although effective, this strategy is computationally more expensive (by re-executing globally the optimization algorithms), and does not <b>allow</b> <b>to</b> <b>react</b> efficiently to dynamic flow behavior. The work of Rankothge et al. [34, 35] is the closest approach to an effective solution to this problem. In that work, the authors use genetic algorithms to introduce network functions with scalable processing capabilities. However, those network functions are considered in isolation, therefore without taking into account possible global optimizations, such as steering flows with similar requirements for higher capacity VNFs.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{advent of}} Service Oriented Architectures tends {{to promote a}} new kind of {{software}} architecture where services, exposing features accessible through highly standardized protocols, are composed in a loose coupling way. In such a context, where services are likely to be replaced or used by a large number of clients, the notion of Quality of Service (QoS), which focuses {{on the quality of the}} relationship between a service and its customers, becomes a key challenge. This paper aims to ease QoS management in service compositions through a better separation of concerns. For this purpose, we designed QoSL 4 BP, a domain-specific language which allows QoS policies specification for business processes. More specifically, the QoSL 4 BP language is designed to allow an architect to specify QoS constraints and mechanisms over parts of BPEL compositions. This language is executed by our ORQOS platform which cooperates in a non-intrusive way with orchestration engines. At pre-deployment time, ORQOS platform performs service planning depending on services QoS offers and on the QoS requirements in QoSL 4 BP policies. At runtime, QoSL 4 BP policies <b>allow</b> <b>to</b> <b>react</b> to QoS variations and to enact QoS management related mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|Summary. Method of curds quality control, {{based on}} {{neural network model}} is {{introduced}} in the paper. It allows to give fair estimate of final product’s quality without use of professional degustators. Method consists in construction of neural network model to estimate quality of curds by input and output parameters. Hardware software complex of curds taste control is proposed to apply in industry for independent estimate of final product. Operation of neural network model based on usage of artificial neural networks, {{which is one of}} directions of artificial intelligence theory. Neural network model consists of several artificial neurons layers, which emulate nerve cells functioning. Feed forward network of MLP type was used in solving of curds taste control problem. Feature of this network is that signals passed from one layer’s neurons to next layer’s neurons only from input layer to output, not the other way. Neural network was trained for its correct operation by selection of optimal synaptic factors. Flow diagram of training algorithm is introduced in the paper. Algorithm of neural network tuning is described in the paper. Author proposed set of recommendations for software-hardware complex deployment.

40|$|Effective enatiomeric {{separation}} and purity of individual form using environmentally benign solvent {{is a topic}} of great interest for pharmaceuticals and food industry due to the different biological activity. [1 - 4] Hence we studied the diastereomeric salt formation of racemic 2 -methoxyphenylacetic acid with enantiopure (R) - 1 - cyclohexylethylamine using gas antisolvent approach in supercritical carbon dioxide. Parametric studies such as effect of different molar ratios, solvents, pressures and temperatures on diastereomeric salt formation reaction were also studied in details. Reaction procedure involved the dissolution of specific molar ratio of racemates and resolving agent in minimum amount of solvent to form homogeneous phase. These homogeneous phases further <b>allow</b> <b>to</b> <b>react</b> in high pressure autoclave / vessel pressurized with supercritical carbon dioxide. Constant temperature is maintained by using the jacketed thermo bath. After the reaction, extraction was done with 3 fold volume of supercritical carbon dioxide with respect to reactor volume. Formed reaction products i. e. raffinate and extract were analyzed by chiral gas chromatography. Wide numbers of polar, non-polar and tuned polarity solvents were screened for the complete solubility of starting materials. Polarity was tuned on mixing of polar and non-polar solvent in certain proportions. Among all combinations acetonitrile and toluene (1 : 1) mixture {{was found to be}} effective. From the racemic mixture : resolving agent molar ratio study it is revealed that the half equivalent method (2 : 1) or commonly known as the Pope-Peachy method is suitable for the resolution of racemic MPAA using (R) -(-) cyclohexylethylamine (yields and enatiomeric excess values reached 80...|$|E
40|$|The Determination of {{molar ratio}} of {{fluorochrome}} to protein {{is an important}} part in fluorescent antibody techniques. The conventional method is time consuming and with troublesome manipulations. A rapid homogeneous method based on the anisotropy change of the fluorochrome after reacting with protein was presented here. In our experiments, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and bovine serum albumin(BSA) were chosen to form the FITC/BSA conjugate. A series of solutions containing the two components were prepared and <b>allow</b> <b>to</b> <b>react</b> according to the standard procedure. Fluorescence anisotropy of the mixtures were detected, a diagram of r-lgc is then obtained, where c is the concentration of protein. Because FITC in the mixture exists in both free form(F) and binding form(B), the fluorescence anisotropy observed is given by r = f(F) r(F) + f(B) r(B), where r(F) and r(B) refer to the anisotropy of free and bound FITC, respectively; and f(F) and f(B) represent the fraction of the free and bound forms, respectively, f(F) + f(B) = 1. A formula as f(B) = (r-r(F)) /(r(B) -r(F)) is achieved. Here r(B) correspods to the value of r in the upper platform region of the r-lgc curve, where FITC is bound to protein completely, while r(F) can be obtained by the determination of anisotropy of FITC in the absence of BSA. So, for each of the mixtures, the binding fraction of FITC can then be calculated. Correspondingly, the content of bound form of FITC that was used to calculate the molar ratio of FITC to BSA can be gained. Since the method avoids the tiresome separation procedure, it bears the merit of time saving and can be used to estimate the molar ratio of fluorochrome to protein rapidly. The determination results of samples by this method were compared with that got from a spectrophotometric analysis. The results were in good agreement...|$|E
