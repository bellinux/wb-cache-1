U.S. Catholic reviewer Mary Lynn Hendrickson also praised Yancey's retelling of Karen Blixen's story.|$|E

2500|$|Frequently, the {{audience}} responded appropriately as Rayburn critiqued the contestant's answer. (For the [...] "world's biggest" [...] question, Rayburn might show disdain to an answer such as [...] "fingers" [...] or [...] "bag" [...] and compliment an answer such as [...] "rear end" [...] or [...] "boobs", often also commenting on {{the audience}}'s approving or disapproving response.) The audience usually groaned or booed when a contestant or celebrity gave a bad or inappropriate answer, whereas they cheered and applauded in approval of <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>answer.</b> Sometimes, they howled at a risque answer.|$|E

60|$|I thought then, growing uneasy, that I {{ought to}} write an answer.

60|$|I {{might tell}} Mark Twain that in France {{a man who}} was seen tipsy in his club would {{immediately}} see his name canceled from membership. A man who had settled his fortune on his wife to avoid meeting his creditors would be refused admission into any decent society. Many a Frenchman has blown his brains out rather than declare himself a bankrupt. Now would Mark Twain remark to this: 'An American is not such a fool: when a creditor stands in his way he closes his doors, and reopens them the following day. When he has been a bankrupt three times he can retire from business?']--It is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|E
60|$|My Lords, we have done, on our part; we {{have made}} out our case; and it only remains {{for me to make}} a few {{observations}} upon what Mr. Hastings has thought proper to put forward in his defence. Does he meet our case with anything but these general attestations, upon which I must first remark, that there is not one single matter of fact touched upon in them? Your Lordships will observe, and you may hunt them out through the whole body of your minutes, that you do not find a single fact mentioned in any of them. But there is an abundance of panegyric; and if we were doing nothing but making satires, as the newspapers charge us with doing, against Mr. Hastings, panegyric would be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|E

60|$|Mr. Lincoln continued: That was not {{the case}} he was making. What motive would tempt any set of men to go into an {{extensive}} survey of a railroad which they did not intend to make? What good would it do? Did men act without motive? Did business men commonly go into an expenditure of money which could be of no account to them? He generally found that men who have money were disposed to hold on to it, unless they could see something to be made by its investment. He could not see what motive of advantage to the new States could be subserved by merely keeping the public lands out of market, and preventing their settlement. As far as he could see, the new States were wholly without any motive to do such a thing. This, then, he took to be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>answer</b> to the first objection.|$|E
6000|$|The Attorney-General {{supported}} Mr. Walpole in affirmance of this principle. He said,--"I {{would follow}} {{the steps of the}} learned gentleman who spoke before me, and I think he has given <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>answer</b> to these objections. I would take notice that we are upon an impeachment, not upon an indictment. The courts below have set forms to themselves, which have prevailed for a long course of time, and thereby are become the forms by which those courts are to govern themselves; but it never was thought that the forms of those courts had any influence on the proceedings of Parliament. In Richard II.'s time, it is said in the records of Parliament, that proceedings in Parliament are not to be governed by the forms of Westminster Hall. We are {{in the case of an}} impeachment, and in the Court of Parliament. Your Lordships have already given judgment against six upon this impeachment, and it is warranted by the precedents in Parliament; therefore we insist that the articles are good in substance." ...|$|E
60|$|That night, {{as he lay}} on {{his little}} pallet, looking through the open front of his tent at the utter {{darkness}} of the night, the idea struck him that it was strange that he was not afraid to stay here alone. He was a brave man,--he knew that very well,--and yet it seemed odd to him that, under the circumstances, he should have so little fear. But his reason soon gave him <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>answer.</b> He had known times when he had been very much afraid, and among these stood preeminent the time when he had expected an attack from the Rackbirds. But then his fear was for others. When he was by himself it was a different matter. It was not often that he did not feel {{able to take care of}} his own safety. If there were any danger now, it was in the daytime, when some stray Rackbirds might come back, or the pilferer of the mound might return with companions. But if any such came, he had his little fort, two pistols, and a repeating rifle. At night he felt absolutely safe. There was no danger that could come by land or sea through the blackness of the night.|$|E

6000|$|The Savoyard Vicar's own {{position}} to Christianity {{was one of}} reverential scepticism. [...] "The holiness of the gospel," [...] he said, [...] "is an argument that speaks to my heart and to which I should even be sorry to find <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>answer.</b> Look at the books of the philosophers with all their pomp; how puny they are {{by the side of}} that! Is there here the tone of an enthusiast or an ambitious sectary? What gentleness, what purity, in his manners, what touching grace in his teaching, what loftiness in his maxims! Assuredly there was something more than human in such teaching, such a character, such a life, such a death. If {{the life and death of}} Socrates were those of a sage, the life and death of Jesus are those of a god. Shall we say that the history of the gospels is invented at pleasure? My friend, that is not the fashion of invention; and the facts about Socrates are less attested than the facts about Christ.[345] Yet with all that, this same gospel abounds in things incredible, which are repugnant to reason, and which it is impossible for any sensible man to conceive or admit. What are we to do in the midst of all these contradictions? To be ever modest and circumspect, my son; to respect in silence what one can neither reject nor understand, and to make one's self lowly before the great being who alone knows the truth."[346] ...|$|E
6000|$|... 1. That {{whatever}} we may dislike {{of the proceedings}} of the ministry, and of the government, of which {{this is not the place}} to speak, there is no greater cheat can be put upon you than this is; for, whatever the jacobite party may promise themselves from the ministry, the ministry do not yet own their measures to tend that way; they do not act avowedly for the pretender; they do all things yet upon the supposition of the protestant succession, and carry it as in the interest of the house of Hanover; and to say they are for the pretender, is to charge them with the greatest treachery and hypocrisy, and is such an insolence in the jacobites, as the ministry ought to show their resentment at them for, and we hope they will do so; besides, there is a manifest difference between the fears of honest men, as that the measures of the ministry may encourage the friends of the pretenders and on the other hand, the insolent way of the jacobites claiming the ministry to be acting in their behalf; while therefore the ministry appear to act under the scheme of the Hanover succession, whether they are sincere or no, it is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>answer</b> to a jacobite, whatever it is to another, to say, it is an unjustifiable assurance, and an affront to the government, to boast of the ministry being in the interest of the pretender.|$|E
60|$|If people disbelieve premisses, {{nothing can}} be easier than to ridicule conclusions; and what {{happened}} now was that critics argued against this or that contrivance in the machinery, because they insisted that no machinery was needed at all, and that no contrivance could ever be made to work, because the Irish mechanicians would infallibly devote all their infatuated energy and perverse skill, not to work it, but to break it in pieces. The Irish, in Mr. Gladstone’s ironical paraphrase of these singular opinions, had a double dose of original sin; they belonged wholly to the kingdoms of darkness, and therefore the rules of that probability which wise men have made the guide of life can have no bearing in any case of theirs. A more serious way of stating the fundamental objection with which Mr. Gladstone had to deal was this. Popular government is at the best difficult to work. It is supremely difficult {{to work in a}} statutory scheme with limits, reservations, and restrictions lurking round every corner. Finally, owing to history and circumstance, no people in all the world is less fitted to try a supremely difficult experiment in government than {{the people who live in}} Ireland. Your superstructure, they said, is enormously heavy, yet you are going to raise it on foundations that are a quaking bog of incapacity and discontent. This may have been <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>answer</b> to the policy of the bill.
