40|$|Recently, the <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>furnace</b> slag {{produced}} {{in a new}} steel-making process aiming at energy and resource saving is being as fine particles under 5 mm size because it breaks down itself due to its high content of f-CaO. In future, this type of <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>furnace</b> slag is anticipated to replace the conventional <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>furnace</b> slag. The objective {{of this study was}} to the applicability of this powdered <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>furnace</b> slag as a subbase material. Firstly, the changes in physical and chemical properties, the surface texture and the hydrated products of the <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>furnace</b> slag naturally weathered outdoors were determined by X-ray diffraction, differential thermal analysis (DTA) and SEM-EDXA analysis. Secondly, the strength test, the CBR test and the expansion test of the compacted <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>furnace</b> slag mixtures were carried out in order to clarify the strength characteristics of the powdered <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>furnace</b> slag as a subbase material and the effect of weathering outdoors on reducing its unfavorable self-deterious properties. The main results obtained are summarized as follows; (1) The major compounds of the powdered <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>furnace</b> slag were β-C_ 2 S, C_ 2 F, C_ 2 S-C_ 3 P, Wustite and a considerably large amount of f-Cao and Ca(OH) _ 2. (2) In the powdered <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>furnace</b> slag naturally weathered outdoors, the hydration of β-C_ 2 S and f-Cao slowly progressed with age, resulting in the formation of C-S-H gel, Ca(OH) _ 2 and CaCO_ 3 on the surface of particles. (3) The powdered <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>furnace</b> slag became a stable material not showing self-deterious property by weathering outdoors for about three months, and thus it can be used as a subbase material...|$|R

40|$|The major {{innovation}} in the steel industry in the post-World War II period has been {{the replacement of the}} open hearth <b>furnace</b> by the <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>furnace.</b> This article examines the diffusion of this important innovation at a more micro level than previous studies by focusing on plant behavior. Wide differences in the characteristics of the plants owned by a particular firm make this focus more appropriate. Using data from several large firms in the industry, estimates are first provided of the productivity of the <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>furnace.</b> Then, differences among plants and firms in the rate of adoption of the <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>furnace</b> are given and the causes of these differences are explored. The major finding of this article is that differences among firms in the rate of adoption of the <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>furnaces</b> are attributable both to the characteristics of the adopting plants that determine the profitability of this innovation and {{to the size of the}} firm. ...|$|R

40|$|We try to {{understand}} the role of technological change and diffusion of energy efficient technologies in order to explain the trend of energy intensity developments in the German steel industry. We selected six key energy efficient technologies and collected data to derive their diffusion since their introduction in Germany. Since all technologies have been applied in Germany for more than 30 years we would expect complete diffusion. We found complete diffusion only for <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>furnaces</b> and continuous casting. Newer technologies (i. e. <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>furnace</b> gas recovery, top pressure recovery turbine, coke dry quenching and pulverized coal injection) diffused quicker in the initial phase but then diffusion slowed down. Key improvements in energy efficiency are due to electric arc <b>furnaces</b> (24 %), <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>furnaces</b> (12 %), and continuous casting (6 %) between 1958 and 2012. The contribution of top pressure recovery turbines, pulverized coal injection and <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>furnaces</b> gas recovery accounts in total of about 3 %. If the selected technologies were diffused completely, the future energy consumption could be reduced by 4. 5 % compared to 2012. Our findings suggest that our selection of six technologies is the key driver for energy intensity developments within the German steel industry between 1958 and 2012. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze {{mixtures}} of <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>furnace</b> slag and granite waste in order to produce Portland cement. X-ray patterns were carried out in both the <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>furnace</b> slag and granite waste. Then, mixtures were prepared to obtain the binary basicity of 0. 5, 0. 9 and 1. 2. The mixtures were melted at 1500 ºC. Two cooling steps were performed. The first cooling step was accomplished inside the furnace in order to determine the phases formed during the melting step. The second cooling process was carried out in water in order to obtain an amorphous structure. Images via scanning electrons microscopy and EDS spectrum were obtained for the mixtures cooling in water. The results showed that <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>furnace</b> slag contains a higher percent of CaO. A binary basicity of 4. 6 was determined. The granite waste appeared as mainly a quartz phase. During the slow cooling step, silicates (akermanite and gehlenite) were formed. On the fast cooling step, amorphous structures were obtained. In addition, images obtained via scanning electrons microscopy showed glass structures. EDS spectrum indicated that the glass structures were composed for calcium silicates. Thus, the results suggest that mixtures using <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>furnace</b> slag and granite waste presented characteristics desirable for Portland cement production...|$|R

40|$|Recently, <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>furnace</b> slag {{produced}} by a new steel-making process is supplied as powdered particles containing a high content of free lime. When this slag {{is used as a}} material for the base course of road, its unfavorable self-deterious property may become an important problem. It is considered that the addition of granulated blastfurnace slag, which is a porous and stable material, to the powdered <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>furnace</b> slag can improve both the strength and durability of compacted mixtures. This paper deals with the effective utilization of powdered <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>furnace</b> slag and granulated blastfurnace slag in road construction. The suitability of compacted mixtures of two slags was investigated utilizing such characteristics as resistance to immersion in water, compressive strength and CBR value. Reaction products and microstructural features of the compacted slag mixtures were also elucidated by DSC-TG analysis, X-ray diffraction analysis and SEM observations. From the results, it was made clear that the addition of granulated blastfurnace slag increased the strength and reduced the expansion in immersion in water, and that the compacted slag mixtures fully satisfied the requirements of strength and durability for the base course of road...|$|R
