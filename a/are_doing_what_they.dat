Yet we must recollect that the old Eastern Empire, under which they were for many centuries, did not teach much uprightness or good faith; and that since that time they have had four hundred years of desperate fighting for their homes and their creed with a cruel and oppressive enemy, and that they deserve honour for their constancy even to the death.

5000|$|Conversely, David Jenkins of Little White Lies praised Fantastic Four for its stylistic {{deviation}} from other recent superhero films, {{and argued that}} the film's characters [...] "make decisions which may appear to lack credibility, but the writing works hard to show you why these people <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are doing - and it's not just haphazard patching work, but believable reasons which build on the themes of the movie". James Berardinelli gave the film {{two and a half}} stars out of four, opining that Fantastic Four is [...] "no better or worse than the other superhero movies of 2015", welcoming the dark tone, and praising the performance of the main actors. However, he stated that as a superhero film, [...] "it falls into the 'adequate' range of the spectrum - neither memorable nor forgettable." ...|$|E

Lewis has now acknowledged that he failed three tests during the 1988 US Olympic trials, which under international rules at the time should have prevented him from competing in the Seoul games. Former athletes and officials came out against the USOC cover-up. [...] "For so many years I lived it. I knew this was going on, but there's absolutely nothing you can do as an athlete.

5000|$|Kenzaburō Ōe has said, [...] "Yoko Ogawa {{is able to}} give {{expression}} to the most subtle workings of human psychology in prose that is gentle yet penetrating." [...] The subtlety in part {{lies in the fact}} that Ogawa's characters often seem not to know why they <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are doing. She works by accumulation of detail, a technique that is perhaps more successful in her shorter works; the slow pace of development in the longer works requires something of a deus ex machina to end them. The reader is presented with an acute description of what the protagonists, mostly but not always female, observe and feel and their somewhat alienated self-observations, some of which is a reflection of Japanese society and especially women's roles within it. The tone of her works varies, across the works and sometimes within the longer works, from the surreal, through the grotesque and the —sometimes grotesquely— humorous, to the psychologically ambiguous and even disturbing. (Hotel Iris, one of her longer works, is more explicit sexually than her other works and is also her most widely translated.) ...|$|E

50|$|Following on {{from the}} events of Secret Wars, where deadly incursions have laid waste {{to most of the}} multiverse, Battleworld, a planet {{composed}} of the remains of alternate realities, is created by Doctor Doom and Doctor Strange, with each reality on the world divided into different domains. In this domain called the Regency, Mary Jane and her husband Peter <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> can to make ends meet and raising their infant daughter Annie May Parker. Mary Jane believes Peter should be spending less time as his costumed alter-ego and focus on the greater responsibilities. Later, following a break-out of Ryker's Island, Mary Jane and Annie find themselves targets of Eddie Brock, aka Venom. Peter battles Venom, with Mary Jane and Annie initially fleeing, but MJ elects to try to help her husband combat Venom. Using a fire engine's sirens to distract him, MJ buys Peter enough time to force Venom into a burning building. At MJ's urging, Peter brings the building down on top of Brock, seemingly killing him. Afterwards, it is revealed Spider-Man is the only hero remaining in the domain after the powerful Regent (Augustus Roman) kills the Avengers and establishes himself as ruler of the domain, with Peter opting to retire as Spider-Man to raise Annie and live up to his vows as a father.|$|E
5000|$|In a mixed review, Ed Power of Hot Press {{observed}} [...] "over-familiarity" [...] and [...] "less {{to say on}} Uno" [...] than on the band's previous work, stating, [...] "they <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> do best. Nothing less, {{but certainly}} nothing more." [...] Dave Simpson of The Guardian called ¡Uno! [...] "a very decent fist of sounding like their twentysomething selves", but wrote that [...] "the pace doesn't vary and the recent social commentary ... {{has given way to}} more teenage concerns". Slant Magazine's Yorgo Douramacos called the album [...] "fairly strong", but felt that the songs [...] "sound like only slightly altered versions of previous entries in the Green Day catalogue." [...] In a negative review, Andy Gill of The Independent panned [...] "Green Day's devotion to the most basic of rock formats" [...] and called the music [...] "patronising corporate rock masquerading, in sweary adolescent anthems as somehow anti-establishment." [...] Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times asserted that the album was too [...] "typical" [...] and [...] "commercial" [...] to be a punk album, writing that it [...] "feels like the work of a band that has painted itself into an aesthetic corner." [...] Paul Mardles of The Observer criticized the album as [...] "largely throwaway, its frenzied, phlegm-flecked songs littered with sentiments ... that sound daft coming from a 40-year-old frontman." [...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune was ambivalent towards its [...] "back-to-basics" [...] approach and perceived a lack of [...] "memorable lyrics". Barry Nicolson of NME found the album more comparable to [...] "the three albums that followed" [...] Dookie, noting [...] "highs that prove unsustainable, and lows that hope you're too adrenalised to notice." [...] Rolling Stone ranked it number eight on their year-end top albums list for 2012.|$|E
