30|$|All {{the one-way}} <b>ANOVA</b> <b>was</b> {{performed}} using Origin 8 statistical package, {{while all the}} multi-way <b>ANOVA</b> <b>was</b> performed using Minitab 16 statistical software package (Elrazak et al. 2013).|$|E
30|$|Regarding {{displacement}} under loading, {{a one-way}} analysis of variance (<b>ANOVA)</b> <b>was</b> used to investigate statistically significant differences between the loading sites.

30|$|Analysis of {{variance}} (<b>ANOVA)</b> <b>is</b> concerned with analyzing {{variation in the}} means of several independent populations which developed by Ronald Fisher. The most important point in traditional <b>ANOVA</b> <b>is</b> a test {{about the significance of}} the difference among population means. This test permits the user to conclude whether the differences among the means of several populations are too deviated to be attributed to the sampling error or not [7]. The basic formulas of classical <b>ANOVA</b> model can <b>be</b> referred to any statistical book [1, 10, 19], but the classical <b>ANOVA</b> has <b>been</b> briefly reviewed in “Classical ANOVA” of this manuscript from [21].|$|R
50|$|One-way <b>ANOVA</b> <b>is</b> used to {{test for}} {{differences}} among two or more independent groups (means),e.g. different levels of urea application in a crop, or different levels of antibiotic action on several bacterial species, or different levels of effect of some medicine on groups of patients. Typically, however, the one-way <b>ANOVA</b> <b>is</b> {{used to test}} for differences among at least three groups, since the two-group case can be covered by a t-test. When {{there are only two}} means to compare, the t-test and the <b>ANOVA</b> F-test <b>are</b> equivalent; the relation between <b>ANOVA</b> and t <b>is</b> given by F = t2.|$|R

30|$|One-way <b>ANOVA</b> <b>was</b> used to {{determine}} the effects of trochus (control, one per cage, and two per cage) on survivorship of coral spat cultured in the hatchery and in situ nursery. Furthermore, {{to determine}} the interactive effects of trochus and culture (hatchery and in situ nursery) treatments on spat survivorship, a two-way <b>ANOVA</b> <b>was</b> performed. Survivorship data met the parametric assumptions of normality (Ryan-Joiner test) and equal variances (Bartlett's and Levene's tests). These parametric procedures were performed with Minitab® statistical software. Two-way <b>ANOVA</b> <b>was</b> also performed to detect differences in the diameter of surviving spat among trochus and culture treatments.|$|E

30|$|To {{test for}} a {{significant}} differences between 99 mTc-SER- 4 in allogeneic and syngeneic transplants with 99 mTc-IgG in allogeneic heart transplants, a one-way <b>ANOVA</b> <b>was</b> first performed; p values of < 0.05 were considered significant. If the one-way <b>ANOVA</b> <b>was</b> significant, then a post hoc analysis was performed with Student–Newman–Keuls pairwise comparison; p values of < 0.05 were considered significant.|$|E

30|$|The {{study was}} carried out in a {{completely}} randomized design. To determine the effects of microorganisms and time on soil microbial load, a two-way <b>ANOVA</b> <b>was</b> carried out. A one way <b>ANOVA</b> <b>was</b> performed for other data. When a significant F value was detected, Tukey–Kramer’s multiple range test was used to determine differences among microbial populations and plant parameters of the different trials (significance level P <  0.05).|$|E
30|$|To check {{whether a}} {{significant}} variation {{exists between the}} seasonal values of both abiotic and biotic parameters, {{one-way analysis of variance}} (<b>ANOVA)</b> <b>was</b> performed. Before the analysis, the D’Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test was carried out to check their normality in distribution, and based on the result, parametric or non-parametric <b>ANOVA</b> <b>was</b> performed for the variables with two-tailed P values and 95  % confidence intervals.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} analyse {{the effect of}} the {{experimental}} factors on the additional costs associated with allowing customers to choose a delivery time window, an analysis of variance (<b>ANOVA)</b> <b>is</b> performed. <b>ANOVA</b> results <b>are</b> subject to independency, variance and normality assumptions [28].|$|R
40|$|Analysis of {{variance}} (<b>ANOVA)</b> <b>is</b> a statistical method that {{is widely used}} in the psychosomatic literature to analyze the results of randomized trials, yet ANOVA does not provide an estimate for the difference between groups, the key variable of interest in a randomized trial. Although the use of <b>ANOVA</b> <b>is</b> frequently justified {{on the grounds that}} a trial incorporates more than two groups, the hypothesis tested by ANOVA for these trials—“Are all groups equivalent?”—is often scientifically uninteresting. Regression methods are not only applicable to trials with many groups, but can be designed to address specific questions arising from the study design. <b>ANOVA</b> <b>is</b> also frequently used for trials with repeated measures, but the consequent reporting of “group effects, ” “time effects, ” and “time-by-group interactions ” is a distraction from statistics of clinical and scientific value. Given that <b>ANOVA</b> <b>is</b> easily misapplied in the analysis of randomized trials, alternative approaches such as regression methods should be considered in preference.
