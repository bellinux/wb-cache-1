40|$|This paper {{presents}} a peer-to-peer based authentication and authorization infrastructure to minimize <b>authentication</b> <b>delays</b> when mobile users roam across different wireless networks. The basic {{idea is to}} avoid exchanging security information between networks visited by a roaming user and the user's home authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) server that is typically located in the home network possibly {{far away from the}} visited network. Instead, authentication and authorization of a roaming user shall be supported by an AAA server in the visited network. We propose that the AAA server that is responsible for authentication and authorization in a newly visited network locates the AAA server in the previously visited network and retrieves the required security information from that AAA server. The AAA servers can be organized in a peerto -peer manner and peer-to-peer mechanisms can be applied for searching and transferring security information between them. We propose several mechanisms for quickly locating the previously responsible AAA server in order to decrease <b>authentication</b> <b>delays.</b> The performance of these mechanisms is evaluated by simulations. Real performance measurements show the rather low performance overhead of application level forwarding used in peer-to-peer networks...|$|R

40|$|<b>Authentication</b> <b>delays</b> of {{the order}} of 1 s are a severe {{bottleneck}} in maintaining QoS guarantees over WLANs. Pre-authentication schemes have been proposed to reduce these delays. However, most of these schemes suffer from an increased message overhead on the network.

In this paper, we exploit the notion of predictability in user mobility patterns and propose a set of novel proactive key distribution algorithms to achieve low latencies while minimizing the message overhead in the network. We further provide a model to measure the responsiveness of our schemes to randomness in user motion. Simulation results indicate up to 70 % message reduction in comparison to existing schemes, while maintaining similar latency values...|$|R

30|$|The {{preceding}} procedures clearly {{show that}} the FIL re-authentication enables {{the execution of the}} re-authentication session between the AP and the MS locally and iteratively. It expedites authenticating mobile users by using the localized re-authentication process and the iterative process. The localized re-authentication process is designated to the support of the local re-authentication, which results in distributing re-authentication session loads and processing loads. The iterative process is designated to enable the execution of localized re-authentication process iterative, which contributes to complete re-authentications iteratively without contact the RADIUS. Based on those advantages, the re-authentication efficiency can be obviously improved as comparing the FIL re-authentication with the standard fast re-authentication and the standard full authentication, respectively. For validating the re-authentication efficiency in the FIL re-authentication, the numerical analysis and performance evaluations about the authentication session time, bandwidth cost, and <b>authentication</b> <b>delays</b> are given in the following section.|$|R
30|$|Seamlessly UMTS is {{the best}} {{platform}} to use with ITS. It can support vehicle-to-roadside as well as vehicle-to-vehicle communications when our modifications are used. The original UMTS was supported by IMS and MBMS to transfer private and common messages. However, when applied to the environment of ITS, it will have some additional considerations, especially the fast movement caused by rapid changes in message routing and multicasting members of the frequent changes. Both of them will cause a heavy load on the MBMS. For this, our protocol introduces the concept of group keys. Moreover, in the UMTS, IMS and MBMS are two separate systems, and the MBMS must be used with the IMS. This has caused wastage of resources and <b>authentication</b> <b>delays.</b> For this, our protocol integrates them into a single protocol. However, to solve the bottlenecks, our protocol is {{an expansion of the}} existing IMS-AKA protocol using support group key. This does not only combine IMS and MBMS but also solves the problems of MBMS in the ITS.|$|R
30|$|Generally, an HO {{delay is}} {{composed}} of an access point (AP) scanning delay [6], <b>authentication</b> <b>delay,</b> and mobile IP registration delay {{in the case of}} an L 3 HO [5]. AP scanning delay occurs in process when mobile STA searches for and selects a new AP. <b>Authentication</b> <b>delay</b> occurs in the process including establishing the identity of the mobile STA and authorizing its access to the basic service set of the AP. Mobile IP registration delay includes two kinds of delays. First one occurs in the HA registration process. Second one occurs when mobile STA configures a new network care of address in the foreign network. One of the main factors responsible for the HO delay has been reported to be the delay due to the authentication process between the WLAN and the 3 G HN [5, 7 – 9]. Existing HO optimization schemes primarily focus on reducing the delay caused when a mobile STA scans for nearby APs [10 – 14]. Even though the time taken by a mobile STA to authenticate the target AP (TAP) contributes to the total handoff delay, schemes to optimize the authentication time have not yet been fully investigated to mobile users performing handoff in WLANs. Therefore, we mainly focus on reducing the <b>authentication</b> <b>delay</b> using fast channel switching and a WLAN power saving mode (PSM) buffering function when the STA performs WLANs' HH in 3 G-WLAN interworking. The advantages of the proposed scheme are summarized as follows: (a) the proposed scheme ensures a reduction in the <b>authentication</b> <b>delay</b> when a mobile STA moves from one AP to another; (b) it supports inter-extended service set (ESS) and inter-domain HOs without the need for modifying the currently deployed APs on the network side; (c) it prevents loss of data because it takes into account the buffering function of the APs; and (d) it overcomes the limitation of the radio coverage of the currently associated AP (CAP), which the existing authentication schemes suffer from when the moving STA perform authentication with the TAP.|$|E

40|$|Fax number: 01 60764711 Abstract: In the era {{of mobile}} and {{wireless}} networks, the growing complexity of end devices and the accentuated tendency towards miniaturization of them raise new security challenges. Authentication is a crucial concern in resource constrained environments, and despite the great number of existing EAP methods, as explained in the article, {{we are still in}} need for EAP methods tightly adapted to wireless environments and satisfying heterogeneity of terminals and their limitations of resources. After a first comparative analysis of existing EAP methods, this article presents a new EAP-EHash method (EHash for Encrypted-Hash) that is adapted to the highly vulnerable wireless environment by supporting mutual authentication, and session key derivation, and offering simplicity, rapidity and easy-to-deploy features. This EAP-EHash was formally proved to satisfy the claimed security properties, thanks to the AVISPA tool. Implementation of it on an 802. 11 testbed platform gave realistic <b>authentication</b> <b>delays</b> averaging 26 milliseconds, and thus proved EAP-EHash is competitive to EAP-MD 5 that is known to be the simplest of the EAP methods. Features of EAP-EHash include short execution delays and low bandwidth consumption...|$|R
40|$|A global-scale, outdoor Internet access {{infrastructure}} {{with low}} infrastructure costs is finally attainable. Emerging projects are leveraging {{the proliferation of}} private Wi-Fi networks to build an access infrastructure from autonomous, independently owned Internet connections. These open Wi-Fi networks aggregate the broadband Internet installations at homes and other private properties into a globalscale shared infrastructure for ubiquitous Internet access. To ensure the traceability and accountability required by the broadband ISPs and private owners of these Wi-Fi networks authentication and authorization are needed. This paper describes Authentication on the Edge, a localized and distributed authentication method for open Wi-Fi networks. Three main ideas are used {{to adapt to the}} variability and unreliability of these networks: the use of certificate-based authentication, the distribution of certificate revocation list segments to all entities, and the self organization of access points into a social look-up network. Authentication on the edge combines centralized administration and operator assistance with distributed algorithms to confine the authentication {{to the edge of the}} network. These methods achieve the scalability needed for the overwhelming size and volume of a global network and increase resiliency against temporary failures of the infrastructure. Overall <b>authentication</b> <b>delays</b> are reduced by as much as 71 % compared to existing authentication schemes applied in the same scenario. Analysis of SMS traces from a large cellular provider show that the social network backend will satisfy all authentication requests as a fallback mechanism. ...|$|R

Nevertheless, the implementation of this method is challenging due to the unique features of the VANETs, such as high mobility and real-time quality in data transmission.|$|E
30|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocol for universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) mobile networks, where a new protocol is proposed. In our proposed protocol, the mobile station {{is responsible for}} generating of authentication token (AUTN) and random number (RAND). The home location register is responsible for comparison of response and expected response to take a decision. Therefore, the bottleneck at authentication center is avoided by {{reducing the number of}} messages between mobile and authentication center. The authentication time delay, call setup time, and signalling traffic are minimized in the proposed protocol. A fluid mobility model is used to investigate the performance of signalling traffic and load transaction messages between mobile database, such as home location register (HLR) and visitor location register (VLR) for both the current protocol and the proposed protocol. The simulation results show that the <b>authentication</b> <b>delay</b> and current load transaction messages between entities and bandwidth are minimized as compared to current protocol. Therefore, the performance and the <b>authentication</b> <b>delay</b> time have been improved significantly.|$|E
40|$|Seamless handoff {{is crucial}} for {{providing}} pervasive wireless access especially to support time-sensitive applications in 802. 11 i security enhanced WLAN, but it introduces large <b>authentication</b> <b>delay</b> to provide advanced security during a handoff.

30|$|IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) {{introduces}} important {{advantages for}} users of LTE-femtocell heterogeneous access networks. In order to access services hosted in the IMS layer, the user has to undergo authentication procedure with the access network, {{followed by an}} authentication procedure with the IMS layer. This multi-pass authentication procedure is essential for securing IMS from malicious users, resulting in added overhead and possible quality of service degradations. The problem is further compounded when the user moves from one femtocell domain into another, which requires the authentication procedure to be repeated. To mitigate this problem, we present a lightweight, robust, and architecture-compatible IMS authentication protocol that implements a one-pass IMS procedure by promoting efficient key re-use for a mobile user. We make use of Home Node B femtocells to perform the role of IMS proxy. To verify the feasibility of using our protocol in mobile networks, an abstract model of our protocol is derived. The abstract model is emulated using Asterisk server and virtualization techniques. We also analyze the <b>authentication</b> <b>delay</b> of our proposed scheme. Numerical results reveal a reduction in user <b>authentication</b> <b>delay</b> of more than 50 percent compared to the existing authentication procedure.|$|E

To increase the security provision, the authentication procedure will have to be performed normally once the handover completes, and the MN has literally attached to the new MAG.

40|$|Abstract — With the {{increasing}} demand for secure and high-quality communications in public access wireless IP networks, {{it is very important}} to have an in-depth understanding of the relationship between the security and quality of service (QoS). In wireless networks, authentication can provide secure communications by preventing unauthorized usage and negotiating the credentials for data transmission. Nevertheless, it induces heavy overhead and delay to data transmission, further deteriorating overall system performance. Therefore, we analyze the impact of authentication on the security and QoS quantitatively in this paper. First, we introduce a system model based on a challenge/response authentication, which is widely used in various mobile environments. Then, a concept of security level is proposed to describe the protection of communications, which is classified with regard to the nature of security, i. e., information secrecy, data integrity, and resource availability. By taking traffic and mobility patterns into account, our approach establishes a direct and quantitative connection between the security and QoS through the authentication.
