40|$|A {{new process}} has been {{developed}} to achieve a very low SiOx /Si interface state density Dit, low recombination velocity S (5 ms) for oxides deposited on silicon substrates at low temperature. The technique involves direct plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), with appropriate growth conditions, followed by a photo-assisted rapid thermal annealing (RTA) process. Approximately 500 -A-thick SiOx layers are deposited on Si by PECVD at 250 � C. with 0. 02 W/cm- 2 rf power, then covered with SiN or an evaporated thin aluminum layer, and subjected to a photo-assisted anneal in forming <b>gas</b> <b>ambient</b> at 350 � C., resulting in an interface state density Dit {{in the range of}} about 1 - 4 � 1010 cm- 2 eV- 1, which sets a record for the lowest interface state density Dit for PECVD oxides fabricated to date. Detailed analysis shows that the PECVD deposition conditions, photo-assisted anneal, forming <b>gas</b> <b>ambient,</b> and the presence of an aluminum layer on top of the oxides during the anneal, all contributed to this low value of interface state density Dit. Detailed metal-oxide semiconductor analysis and model calculations show that such a low recombination velocity S is the result of moderately high positive oxide charge (5 � 1011 - 1 � 1012 cm- 2) and relatively low midgap interface state density (1 � 1010 - 4 � 1010 cm- 2 eV- 1). Photo-assisted anneal was found to be superior to furnace annealing, and a forming <b>gas</b> <b>ambient</b> was better than a nitrogen ambient for achieving a very low surface recombination velocity S.

40|$|I {{review the}} {{influence}} jets and the bubbles they inflate {{might have on}} their <b>ambient</b> <b>gas</b> as they operate through a negative jet feedback mechanism (JFM). I discuss astrophysical systems where jets are observed to influence the <b>ambient</b> <b>gas,</b> in many cases by inflating large, hot, and low-density bubbles, and systems where {{the operation of the}} JFM is still a theoretical suggestion. The first group includes cooling flows in galaxies and clusters of galaxies, star-forming galaxies, young stellar objects, and bipolar planetary nebulae. The second group includes core collapse supernovae, the common envelope evolution, the grazing envelope evolution, and intermediate luminosity optical transients. The suggestion that the JFM operates in these four types of systems {{is based on the assumption}} that jets are much more common than what is inferred from objects where they are directly observed. Common to all eight types of systems reviewed here is the presence of a compact object inside an extended <b>ambient</b> <b>gas.</b> The <b>ambient</b> <b>gas</b> serves as a potential reservoir of mass to be accreted on to the compact object. If the compact object launches jets as it accretes mass, the jets might reduce the accretion rate as they deposit energy to the <b>ambient</b> <b>gas,</b> or even remove the entire <b>ambient</b> <b>gas,</b> hence closing a negative feedback cycle.

40|$|Protostellar outflow is a {{prominent}} process that accompanies {{the formation of}} stars. It is generally agreed that wide-angled protostellar outflows come from {{the interaction between the}} wind from a forming star and the <b>ambient</b> <b>gas.</b> However, it is still unclear how the interaction takes place. In this work, we theoretically investigate the possibility that the outflow results from interaction between the wind and the <b>ambient</b> <b>gas</b> in the form of turbulent entrainment. In contrast to the previous models, turbulent motion of the <b>ambient</b> <b>gas</b> around the protostar is taken into account. In our model, the ram-pressure of the wind balances the turbulent ram-pressure of the <b>ambient</b> <b>gas,</b> and the outflow consists of the <b>ambient</b> <b>gas</b> entrained by the wind. The calculated outflow from our modelling exhibits a conical shape. The total mass of the outflow is determined by the turbulent velocity of the envelope as well as the outflow age, and the velocity of the outflow is several times higher than the velocity dispersion of the <b>ambient</b> <b>gas.</b> The outflow opening angle increases with the strength of the wind and decreases with the increasing <b>ambient</b> <b>gas</b> turbulence. The outflow exhibits a broad line width at every position. We propose that the turbulent entrainment process, which happens ubiquitously in nature, plays a universal role in shaping protostellar outflows.

40|$|Formation of {{low-cost}} high-quality contacts {{is the key}} to cost-effective silicon solar cells. Screen-printing is widely used in Industry because it is simple, low-cost and rapid. However, cost and throughput gains are attained at the expense of performance. IFill factors of most commercial cells are in the range of 0. 68 - 75 for single crystalline material. This paper shows that a rapid 400 °C/ 0. 5 - 3 min photo-assisted anneal in a forming <b>gas</b> <b>ambient</b> can raise the fill factor (FF) of screem-printed (SP) single and multi-crystalline (mc) Si cells from- 0. 70 to- 0. 77 and 0. 76, respectively. Dark I-V analysis showed that this results from a decrease in series resistance by a factor of 2 to 4. Thus initial belt firing condiitions can be tailored (> 7 OO’C) to first prevent the junction shunting, which generally results in high series resistance (R,), and then the rapid photo-assisted anneal in forming <b>gas</b> <b>ambient</b> can be used to reduce the resistive losses for achieving high FF without much junction shunting. The LBIC analysis on multi-crystalline silicon shows that a 30 -second forming gas anneal in RTP not only reduces the glass frit at the silicon/silver interface but also enhances hydrogenation of bulk defects...|$|R

40|$|Continuous cost {{reduction}} of silicon-based solar cells {{is needed to}} lower the process time and increase efficiency. To achieve lower costs, screen-printed texture-barrier (SPTB) paste was first developed for single-side texturization (ST) of the interdigitated back-contact (IBC) for silicon-based solar cell applications. The SPTB paste was screen-printed on silicon substrates. The SPTB paste was synthesized from intermixed silicate glass (75 wt %), a resin binder (ethyl cellulose ethoce: 20 wt %), and a dispersing agent (fatty acid: 5 wt %). The silicate glass is a necessity for contact formation during firing. A resin binder and a dispersing agent determine the rheology of the SPTB paste. In this work, by modulating various parameters, including post SPTB firing, alkali texturing, and removal of the SPTB, the ST of IBC silicon solar cells was achieved. Since {{the advantages of the}} SPTB paste include low toxicity and prompt formation of the texture-barrier, SPTB is potentially suited for simple fabrication at low-cost for solar cell applications. The cost of the SPTB is around $ 100 /kg which is lower than the SiH 4 /NH 3 <b>gas</b> <b>ambient</b> used in plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD).

Significant improvement of the emission properties was found when the cathode was operated in carbon monoxide ambient under a certain condition. It {{was found that the}} effect of the improvement lasted at least 200 h, and resistance against the oxygen exposure was also improved.

The electron emissionproperties were distributed along a straight line in the Seppen–Katamuki chart, and those of the cathode improved by carbon monoxide exposure were distributed along another line. The deviation of the electron emissionproperty in ultrahigh vacuum was considered to be due to change in the geometry of the emitting surface. The major reason for the modification of electron emissionproperties in carbon monoxide ambient was considered to be deposition of carbon onto the emitting surface, resulting in reduction of the work function.

40|$|Thin {{films of}} a wide variety of {{materials}} can be produced using an assortment of physical and chemical techniques. Such techniques are reviewed and compared, with particular reference to the deposition of tin oxide films. In the present study, MOCVD (Metal organic chemical vapour deposition) was used to grow thin films of tin oxide from dibutyltin diacetate precursor on a variety of substrates. A series of reactor prototypes were developed in accordance with specific requirements of reproducibility and process control. The evolution of the designs leading to the final working system is detailed. The theory of MOCVD is given with particular reference to the reactor used in this project. The effects of various deposition parameters on tin oxide film growth rates were investigated, and the results are discussed with reference to the deposition kinetics in the system. Films were characterised by optical interferometry, optical and electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Rutherford backscattering and electrical measurements. The films were generally uniform, conducting and polycrystalline, and were comprised of very small grains, resulting in a high density. A specific application of metal oxide materials is in solid state gas sensors, which are available in various forms and operate according to different mechanisms. These are compared and a detailed account is given on the theory of operation of surface conductivity modulated devices. The application of such devices based on tin oxide in thin film form was investigated in the present work. The prepared sensor samples were comprised of very small grains, resulting in a high density. The observation that preferred (310) orientation occurred in thicker films, can be attributed to dendritic growth. The sensors generally showed response to numerous reducing <b>gas</b> <b>ambients,</b> although there was evidence of a degree of selectivity against methane. Sensor response times due to changes in <b>gas</b> <b>ambients</b> between hydrogen and dried air were related to sensor thickness in terms of a grain surface defect diffusion process. This is driven by the equilibrium requirement between the exposed, gas modulated film surface states and inter-grain surface defects which are not subject to direct interaction with the <b>gas</b> <b>ambient,</b> owing to low structural porosity...|$|R
