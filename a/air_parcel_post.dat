50|$|Domestic <b>parcel</b> <b>post</b> {{service was}} adopted in 1913, 25 {{years after the}} Post Office had agreed to deliver {{international}} <b>parcel</b> <b>post</b> packages pursuant to the Universal Postal Union treaty and various bilateral agreements with other nations. Initially, there were no or few postal regulations governing packages mailed by <b>parcel</b> <b>post.</b> E.g., to construct a bank in Vernal, Utah, in 1916, a Salt Lake City company ascertained that the cheapest way to send 40 tons of bricks to the building was by <b>parcel</b> <b>post.</b>|$|R
25|$|Special stamps {{were printed}} for <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> service {{to help in}} the effort of keeping {{accounts}} and revenues generated from general postage and the <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> separate. The twelve <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> stamps had three basic design themes that were associated with the Post Office and its delivery service. The denominations were such that any amount of postage up to one dollar could be made by using no more than three stamps. Three of the <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> denominations—20 cents, 25 cents and 75 cents—were new to U. S. Postage.|$|R
50|$|CIN is {{the amount}} of energy {{required}} to overcome the negatively buoyant energy the environment exerts on an <b>air</b> <b>parcel.</b> In most cases, when CIN exists, it covers a layer from the ground to the level of free convection (LFC). The negatively buoyant energy exerted on an <b>air</b> <b>parcel</b> {{is a result of the}} <b>air</b> <b>parcel</b> being cooler (denser) than the air which surrounds it, which causes the <b>air</b> <b>parcel</b> to accelerate downward. The layer of air dominated by CIN is warmer and more stable than the layers above or below it.|$|R
25|$|With the {{termination}} of <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> stamps the need for <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> Postage Due stamps also ended. They had seen little use since most parcels were properly weighed and paid for at post offices. But in a way analogous to the <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> issues they were retained by postmasters and used as regular postage due stamps until the supplies were exhausted. Some were employed well into the 1920s. The 25-cent denomination was of particular use {{since there was no}} correspondingly valued regular postage due stamp.|$|R
50|$|It {{was also}} in 1913, in January, that the Post Office {{introduced}} domestic <b>parcel</b> <b>post</b> service (a belated development, given that international <b>parcel</b> <b>post</b> service between the United States and other countries began in 1887). A series of twelve <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> stamps intended for this service had already been released in December 1912, ranging in denomination from 1¢ to $1. All were printed in red and designed in the wide Columbian format. The eight lowest values illustrated aspects of mail handling and delivery, while higher denominations depicted such industries as Manufacturing, Dairying and Fruit Growing. Five green <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> Postage Due stamps appeared concurrently. It soon became obvious {{that none of these}} stamps was needed: parcel postage could easily be paid by definitive or commemorative issues, and normal postage due stamps were sufficient for parcels. When original stocks ran out, no reprints appeared, nor were replacements for either group ever contemplated. However, one denomination introduced in the <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> series—20¢ - had proved useful, and the Post Office added this value to the Washington-Franklin issues in 1914, along with a 30¢ stamp.|$|R
50|$|Terminal Railway Post Offices (Term RPO) {{were started}} in nearly 100 cities in late 1913 and 1914, {{primarily}} to help handle {{the increase in}} volume of <b>parcel</b> <b>post</b> which was overwhelming the main transportation system. These terminals also came to distribute transit <b>parcel</b> <b>post,</b> circulars, magazines, and papers - mail that was generally considered less urgent than first class letters. Letter cases were used at many terminals {{to take care of}} advance work or unworked letters from Railway Post Office (RPO) routes, while a few terminals handled <b>parcel</b> <b>post</b> almost exclusively. The largest terminal railway post office was the Penn Terminal in the G.P.O. Building in New York City, New York—in 1951, it had over 1,100 clerks. Penn Terminal handled advance work for many of the railway post office routes leaving New York City. By comparison, the West Side Terminal, located along the New York Central line near the Hudson River piers, handled <b>parcel</b> <b>post</b> almost exclusively. Because <b>parcel</b> <b>post</b> transportation was generally by rail, most terminal RPOs were housed in or adjacent to the railroad station.|$|R
