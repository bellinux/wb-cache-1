5|$|In 1928, the {{gendarmerie}} was reorganized as the Garde d'Haïti {{and became}} the nucleus of what would eventually evolve into the reconstituted Haitian army. The later politicization of the Haitian military has been attributed by some to Haiti's early experience with the Gendarmerie d'Haïti. The gendarmerie's special access to U.S. resources and influence vested in it a measure of social control within Haiti that would become institutionalized in later years. On the other hand, former Haitian President Prosper Avril has observed that Haiti already had {{a long tradition of}} military involvement in government prior to the occupation, with 25 of its 26 pre-occupation presidents being either military officers or leaders of rebel groups. Avrill also contends the gendarmerie worked to instill <b>a</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> political neutrality in its men.|$|E
5|$|The {{paintings}} {{of the first generation}} of Netherlandish artists are often characterised by the use of symbolism and biblical references. Van Eyck pioneered, and his innovations were taken up and developed by van der Weyden, Memling and Christus. Each employed rich and complex iconographical elements to create a heightened sense of contemporary beliefs and spiritual ideals. Morally the works express a fearful outlook, combined with <b>a</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> restraint and stoicism. The paintings above all emphasise the spiritual over the earthly. Because the cult of Mary was at an apex at the time, iconographic elements related to the Life of Mary vastly predominate.|$|E
5|$|Playford, used to {{cooperating}} with Labor leaders more than attacking them, sensed Dunstan's promise and, predicting {{that one day}} Dunstan {{would be at the}} helm, attempted to establish bonds. So, after a late session of parliament at night, Playford would give Dunstan a lift home in his car. As Dunstan's home was situated on George Street, Norwood, it was only a small deviance from Playford's normal route to his home in Norton Summit. The topics that the two discussed were not ever completely revealed, yet Playford, according to Dunstan, would talk to him in a paternalistic manner. The two built up somewhat of a relationship and developed <b>a</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> each other, but due to the strength of their respective views (Playford was a liberal conservative, Dunstan a libertarian socialist), did not establish the same type of bond that Playford had with earlier Laborites.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Aachen {{had cost}} both the Americans and Germans dearly; the former {{suffered}} over 5,000 casualties, {{while the latter}} lost over 5,000 casualties and 5,600 taken prisoner. Since 2 October 1944, the 30th Infantry Division suffered roughly 3,000 men killed and wounded, while the 1st Infantry Division took at least 1,350 casualties (150 killed and 1,200 wounded). The Germans lost another 5,100 casualties during the fighting in Aachen itself, including 3,473 prisoners. In {{the process of the}} battle, the Wehrmacht lost two complete divisions and had another eight severely depleted, including three fresh infantry divisions and a single refitted armored division; this was largely attributed to how they fought, as although an equivalent of 20 infantry battalions had been used during various counterattacks against the 30th Infantry Division alone, on average each separate attack only involved two infantry regiments. During the conflict, the Germans also developed <b>a</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> the fighting ability of American forces, noting their capability to fire indiscriminately with overwhelming amounts of artillery fire support and armored forces. Both the 30th Infantry and 1st Infantry divisions received distinguished unit citations for their actions at Aachen.|$|E

25|$|Asian Americans are {{sometimes}} {{characterized as a}} model minority in the United States because many of their cultures encourage a strong work ethic, <b>a</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> elders, {{a high degree of}} professional and academic success, a high valuation of family, education and religion. Statistics such as high household income and low incarceration rate, low rates of many diseases and higher than average life expectancy are also discussed as positive aspects of Asian Americans.|$|E
25|$|The Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz was {{established}} in 1986 by the Monk family and Maria Fisher.

In addition to hosting an annual International Jazz Competition since 1987, the Institute also helped, through its partnership with UNESCO, designate April 30, 2012, as the first annual International Jazz Day.|$|E

25|$|In the meantime, {{the first}} measure taken by the cabinet was a new land reform that advertised, among others, an {{interest}} into peasant issues and <b>a</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> property (in front of common fears that a Leninist program {{was about to be}} adopted). According to Frunză, although contrasted by the Communist press with its previous equivalent, the measure was supposedly much less relevant—land awarded to individual farmers in 1923 was {{more than three times the}} 1945 figures, and all effects were canceled by the 1948–1962 collectivization.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the first European {{settlers}} arrived in the area, smallpox had already spread to the region, decimating Native American populations. The first European settler to homestead in the area was Hale Tharp, who famously built a home out of a hollowed-out fallen giant sequoia log in the Giant Forest next to Log Meadow. Tharp allowed his cattle to graze the meadow, {{but at the same}} time had <b>a</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> the grandeur of the forest and led early battles against logging in the area. From time to time, Tharp received visits from John Muir, who would stay at Tharp's log cabin. Tharp's Log can still be visited today in its original location in the Giant Forest.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{standard}} ethical theory, respecting dignity {{can also be}} aligned with having <b>a</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> people and their autonomous choices. People are then enabled {{to make decisions about}} their own treatment. Amongst other things this grounds the practice of informed consent that should be respected by the nurse, although much of the debate lies in the discussion of cases where people are unable to make choices about their own treatment due to being incapacitated or having a mental illness that affects their judgement. A suggested way to maintain autonomy is for the person to write an advance directive, outlining how they wish to be treated in the event of their inability to make an informed choice, thus avoiding unwarranted paternalism.|$|E

25|$|By 1913, Pershing {{agreed that}} the Moro Province needed to {{transition}} to civil government. This was prompted by the Moro's personalistic approach to government, {{which was based on}} personal ties rather than <b>a</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> an abstract office. To the Moros, a change of administration meant not just a change in leadership but a change in regime, and was a traumatic experience. Rotation within the military meant that each military governor could serve only for a limited time. Civil governors were needed in order to provide for a lengthy tenure in office. Until 1911, every district governor and secretary had been a military officer. By November 1913, only one officer still held a civil office – Pershing himself. In December 1913, Pershing was replaced as governor of Moro Province by a civilian, Frank Carpenter.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the month, {{arrangements}} for Freud's own departure for London had become stalled, mired in a legally tortuous and financially extortionate process of negotiation with the Nazi authorities. The Nazi-appointed Kommissar put in charge of his assets and those of the IPA proved to be sympathetic to Freud's plight. Anton Sauerwald had studied chemistry at Vienna University under Professor Josef Herzig, an old friend of Freud's, and evidently retained, notwithstanding his Nazi Party allegiance, <b>a</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> Freud's professional standing. Expected to disclose details of all Freud's bank accounts to his superiors and to follow their instructions to destroy the historic library of books housed in the offices of the IPA, in the event Sauerwald did neither, removing evidence of Freud's foreign bank accounts to his own safe-keeping and arranging the storage of the IPA library in the Austrian National Library where it remained until {{the end of the}} war.|$|E
25|$|His {{colleagues at}} the United Nations mission {{included}} a group of outstanding Egyptian diplomats who would later in their careers assume positions of importance among them was Mohamed Riad, Egypt's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Abdel Raouf El Reedy, long-serving Ambassador to the United States, and Mohamed Shaker, Ambassador to the United Kingdom. When Sharaf joined the Egyptian mission at New York it was headed by ambassador Omar Loutfi, one of Egypt’s most distinguished, accomplished and vocal diplomats. Loutfi was a fervent nationalist who opposed superpower expansion and involvement in the Middle East. He would instill in Sharaf <b>a</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> the importance of upholding international law in an increasingly divided and polarized world. Loutfi would later assume the position of Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations for Special Political Affairs. Loutfi, a one-time President of the United Nations Security Council, would die on the premises of the UN building at New York {{of a heart attack}} on 17 May 1963.|$|E

25|$|In the 5th century, Germanic peoples, {{including}} the Franks, Suevi, Vandals, and Visigoths, {{as well as}} the Alans of Sarmatian descent, crossed the Pyrenees mountain range into the Iberian peninsula. The Visigoths eventually emerged as the dominant power, and in about 511, they moved onto the Malaca coast. However, Hispania remained relatively Romanized under their rule—it did not see a decline in the perpetuation of classical culture comparable to that in Britain, Gaul, Lombardy and Germany. The Visigoths adopted Roman culture and language, and maintained more of the old Roman institutions. They had <b>a</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> the legal codes that resulted in continuous frameworks and historical records for most of the period between 415, when Visigothic rule in parts of Spain began, and 711, when it is traditionally said to end. The Catholic bishops were the rivals of Visigothic power and culture {{until the end of the}} 6th and beginning of the 7th century—the period of transition from Arianism to Catholicism in the Visigothic kingdom—excepting a brief incursion of Byzantine power.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. {{has been}} criticized for making {{statements}} supporting peace and respecting national sovereignty, but while carrying out military actions such as in Grenada, fomenting a civil war in Colombia to break off Panama, and Iraq. The U.S. {{has been criticized}} for advocating free trade but while protecting local industries with import tariffs on foreign goods such as lumber and agricultural products. The U.S. has also been criticized for advocating concern for human rights while refusing to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The U.S. has publicly stated that it is opposed to torture, but {{has been criticized for}} condoning it in the School of the Americas. The U.S. has advocated <b>a</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> national sovereignty but has supported internal guerrilla movements and paramilitary organizations, such as the Contras in Nicaragua. The U.S. has been criticized for voicing concern about narcotics production in countries such as Bolivia and Venezuela but doesn't follow through on cutting certain bilateral aid programs. The U.S. has been criticized for not maintaining a consistent policy; it has been accused of denouncing alleged rights violations in China while supporting alleged human rights abuses by Israel.|$|E
