5|$|In the Book of Esther it {{is related}} that Haman, a public servant, plots to get Esther's husband, the King of Persia, to slay all the Jewish {{people in his}} land. The King, who is going over his books during a sleepless night, realises {{something}} is amiss. Esther, discovering the plot, denounces Haman, and her husband orders his execution on a scaffold he has built. The King's eunuchs promptly carry this out. Michelangelo shows Haman crucified with Esther looking <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> a doorway, the King giving orders in the background.|$|E
5|$|In {{the game}} with Auburn, Tech piled up 472 yards {{on the ground in}} 84 rushes and 145 yards in the air. Guyon scored four {{touchdown}}s, and Strupper had a 65-yard touchdown run. According to the Atlanta Journal,It was not the length of the run that featured it was the brilliance of it. After getting through the first line, Stroop was tackled squarely by two secondary men, and yet he squirmed and jerked loosed from them, only to face the safety man and another Tiger, coming <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> different angles. Without checking his speed Everett knifed the two men completely, running between them and dashing on to a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Stirling {{still held}} the line against Grant on the American right, to the west. He held on for four hours, still {{unaware of the}} British {{flanking}} maneuver, {{and some of his}} own troops thought that they were winning the day because the British had been unable to take their position. However, Grant was reinforced by 2,000 marines, and he hit Stirling's center by 11:00, and Stirling was attacked on his left by the Hessians. Stirling pulled back, but British troops were coming <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> the rear, south down the Gowanus Road. The only escape route left was across a Brouwer's millpond on the Gowanus Creek which was 80 yards wide, {{on the other side of}} Brooklyn Heights.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal kicked-off {{the match}} {{and within the}} first two minutes forced Manchester United defender Gary Neville to concede a throw-in. In the fifth minute, Manchester United won a free kick, but nothing {{came out of it}} as José Antonio Reyes blocked Paul Scholes's shot. Good play by Reyes and Henry {{fashioned}} a chance for Bergkamp in the ninth minute, but his strike was off target. Two minutes later a shot by Bergkamp from outside the box was saved by Manchester United goalkeeper Tim Howard. Before Henry was about to take a corner for Arsenal in the 16th minute, a cigarette lighter was thrown <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> the section occupied by Manchester United supporters – this resulted in police making two arrests during the game. Quinton Fortune used his pace to get the better of Lauren, but his cross into the Arsenal penalty area was cleared by Pascal Cygan. Arsenal continued to threaten – Henry's free kick prompted Howard to make a save and tip the ball over the crossbar, and Bergkamp came close to scoring in the 27th minute after clever play to lose his marker John O'Shea. The football continued to move {{from one end to the}} other, with Giggs and Reyes causing problems for their respective defences. In stoppage time at the end of the first half, Henry had his shot saved by Howard, while Scholes was similarly denied by Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.|$|E
5|$|Once the Confederates {{had crossed}} the river, the Alice Dean was set ablaze and sunk in the river between Morvin's landing and Mauckport to deny the Union pursuers use of the vessel and to block the landing, making their {{crossing}} more difficult. Morgan ordered the McCombs to be burnt, but Col. Duke countermanded the order because of his friendship with its captain. He was allowed to return with his ship to Louisville unharmed. Gen. Hobson and {{the main body of}} the Union cavalry arrived in Brandenburg at about 10:15 pm, just as the Alice Dean went under the water. He set up his artillery and fired several shots at the Confederates who jeered <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> the opposite side of the river; they quickly withdrew out of range of his guns. The lead elements of the cavalry had already set out northward following the Legion forces who withdrew gradually and fought delaying skirmishes along the Mauckport road to slow the cavalry's advance towards Corydon.|$|E
5|$|The departures of Núñez and Louis van Gaal {{were hardly}} noticed by the fans when {{compared}} to that of Luís Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou with Madrid, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> the crowd. The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Llorenç Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season.|$|E

Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> the crowd. The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season. Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot {{on the final day of}} the season. Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to Van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Antić, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Antić's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.|$|E
25|$|Another murder {{occurred}} at 4 AM, when 54-year-old African American Sam Winchester was shot corner of E. 116th and Regalia Avenue. As he lay dying in an ambulance, he claimed {{a white male}} shot <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> an automobile. Cleveland police, however, said they were unsure if Winchester's death was riot-related.|$|E
25|$|In April 1994, Cantona {{was awarded}} the 1994 Professional Footballers' Association Players' Player of the Year Award by his fellow professionals. Cantona had been banned from March until October 1995 for aiming a flying kick at a spectator gesturing <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> the Palace crowd as he walked off the field after being sent off for a {{straight}} red card offence shortly after half time during a League game on Wednesday 25 January 1995 at Selhurst Park against Crystal Palace.

25|$|Ambulances took McCall and Irvin to Waterman Hospital in Eustis. McCall {{was treated}} for a {{concussion}} and facial injuries, and Irvin for his gunshot wounds. At the hospital Irvin met with NAACP lawyers and later told the press that McCall shot him and Shepherd without provocation, as did Yates. In the early 21st century, Gilbert King examined the unredacted FBI files from the case. He wrote in his book published in 2012 that the FBI had located {{a bullet in the}} soil ten inches below the blood stain where Irvin had lain wounded, supporting Irvin's claim that Yates fired <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> near point blank range.|$|E
25|$|Hawkins {{had told}} me aboard the ship that he would put his platoon of men up against any company of {{soldiers}} on earth and guarantee to win. He was slightly wounded by shrapnel as he came ashore in the first wave, but {{the furthest thing from}} his mind was to be evacuated. He led his platoon into the forest of coconut palms. During {{a day and a half}} he personally cleaned out six Jap machine gun nests, sometimes standing on top of a track and firing point blank at four or five men who fired back <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> behind blockhouses. Lieutenant Hawkins was wounded a second time, but he still refused to retire. To say that his conduct was worthy of the highest traditions of the Marine Corps is like saying the Empire State Building is moderately high.|$|E
25|$|Bourque then {{fled the}} woods and emerged {{southeast}} of McCoy Street, where he continued walking {{in a straight line}} on Mailhot Avenue. There, two minutes after he shot Gevaudan, he encountered Cst. David Ross, who was driving a police sports utility vehicle down the road. Ross drew his service pistol and accelerated his vehicle towards Bourque as he was turning to face his direction. Ross fired two shots at Bourque through his windshield, while Bourque fired six shots back at him. Ross was shot twice in the hand and left shoulder, with a third fatal shot being directed at the head. It was believed he was attempting to hit Bourque with his vehicle or get within range to open fire with his service weapon.Cst. Eric White later found Ross's body still slumped inside the driver's seat before being forced to take cover behind the vehicle after spotting Bourque taking aim <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> further down the street.|$|E

25|$|Classical rabbinical sources also {{allude to}} a war between the Canaanites and Judah's family (not {{mentioned}} in the Hebrew Bible), {{as a result of}} their destruction of Shechem in revenge for the rape of Dinah; Judah features heavily as a protagonist in accounts of this war. In these accounts Judah kills Jashub, king of Tappuah, in hand-to-hand combat, after first having deposed Jashub from his horse by throwing an extremely heavy stone (60 shekels in weight) <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> a large distance away (the Midrash Wayissau states 177⅓ cubits, while other sources have only 30 cubits); the accounts say that Judah was able to achieve this even though he was himself under attack, from arrows which Jashub was shooting at him with both hands. The accounts go on to state that while Judah was trying to remove Jashub's armour from his corpse, nine assistants of Jashub fell upon him in combat, but after Judah killed one, he scared away the others; nevertheless, Judah killed several members of Jashub's army (42 men according to the midrashic Book of Jasher, but 1000 men according to the Testament of Judah).|$|E

The Bears shoot light <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> their bellies, forming their [...] "Care Bear Stare"; the Cousins also help by using their [...] "Care Cousin Call". Afterward, True Heart and Noble Heart decide to search for him, and leave the Bears to handle missions all by themselves.|$|E
500|$|Strupper scored five touchdowns against Carlisle, {{including}} a 32-yard fumble {{return for a}} touchdown.

500|$|The Dakota's doorman, Jose Perdomo, and {{a nearby}} cab driver saw Chapman {{standing}} in the shadows by the archway. As Lennon passed by, he glanced briefly at Chapman, appearing to recognise him from earlier.

Based on statements made that night by NYPD Chief of Detectives James Sullivan, numerous radio, television, and newspaper reports claimed at the time that, before firing, Chapman called out, [...] "Mr. Lennon", and dropped into a combat stance.|$|E
500|$|Israel entered {{one male}} tennis player into the Olympic tournament. Dudi Sela (world no. 65) {{qualified}} {{directly to the}} event {{as one of the}} top 56 eligible players in the ATP World Rankings , making him the first Israeli to compete in the men's singles tournament since 1992, when Gilad Bloom lost his second round match to Jim Courier of the United States. In the round of 64, Sela won both sets 6–4 against Damir Džumhur from Bosnia. During the hour and a half match, there was a five-minute stoppage when Dzumhur claimed fans were cursing <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> the crowd.

500|$|Nix {{praised the}} game's sound design, {{describing}} it as [...] "far and away above {{what would be}} expected on the Game Boy Color." [...] He noted, for example, that [...] "there are individual sounds of the lightsaber swinging back and forth — cutting left will sound differently than the backswing or upswing of the third stroke against an enemy." [...] Samantha Craggs of The Electric Playground praised Obi-Wan's Adventures for its interesting gameplay {{and the use of}} the lightsaber. She commented: [...] "There are quite a few things to like about this game. For one thing, you can't underestimate the feeling of moving across the floor wielding a deadly lightsaber. Also, the levels are interesting. [...] In , Obi-Wan is actually in a boat, going through the Naboo swamp, while battle droids shoot <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> the banks. While you're essentially fighting the same enemies in the same manner, there are enough twists in the level designs to interest you in continuing." ...|$|E
