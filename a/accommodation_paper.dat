As highly diverse areas, multicultural neighborhoods have to accommodate different cultures, sometimes coming together randomly and consisting almost exclusively of lower-income families {{and those with}} a need for cheaper <b>accommodation.</b> This <b>paper</b> investigates the intersection between the urban development of multicultural neighborhoods and the social interactions of migrants residing in them...|$|R
30|$|Previous {{research}} shows that workers who acquire a work disability may either change employer or stay with their current employer in an accommodated job. Previous research also shows that workplace accommodations increase the employment duration of disabled workers and that change of employer reduces wages and the probability of receiving <b>accommodations.</b> This <b>paper</b> builds on these findings but focuses on how job changes affect the employment duration of long-term sick-listed workers.|$|R

How-ever, different individuals will vary their language to different degrees, {{and only a}} portion of this variance will be due to <b>accommodation.</b> This <b>paper</b> presents the Zelig Quotient, a method of normalising linguistic variation towards a particular individual, using an author’s other com-munications as a baseline, thence to derive a method for identifying accommodation-induced variation with statistical significance. This work provides a platform for future efforts towards examining the importance of such phenomena in large communications datasets. ...|$|R

However, few studies have been undertaken to test the compatibility between affordable housing and sustainable housing. A fundamental understanding of these two issues is necessary to develop successful examples of this form of <b>accommodation.</b> This <b>paper</b> aims to identify a suite of built forms for housing that are both affordable and environmentally sustainable. A series of case studies were conducted to investigate both international and national best practice. The result was the development of a framework that enables the assessment of the overall performance of various types of housing developments. ...|$|R

40|$|Research on the {{practical}} problems of allocating homes according to need {{has recently been}} eclipsed by heated debate on the privatisation of public housing. In {{the wake of the}} British government's new commitment to the idea of state-subsidised <b>accommodation,</b> this <b>paper</b> reconsiders the problem of discretion in effecting welfare transfers. It explores how nine local authority housing departments process applications from people with health problems and mobility needs. We argue, contrary to the prevailing wisdom, that discretion is inevitable, necessary and often desirable when assessing housing needs and matching needy applicants to homes. Neither total market freedom nor complete bureaucratic constraint seem likely to solve the problem with social housing. However, an approach balancing unavoidable discretion with rigorous accountability might be a fruitful way forward...|$|R
40|$|Ageing populations {{provoke the}} {{question}} of how much bespoke housing should be provided for the elderly. Older people are generally reluctant to move but as they age health circumstances may encourage moves into specialised <b>accommodation.</b> This <b>paper</b> reports an exercise in estimating the future demand for specialised independent living housing {{and the extent to which}} that demand will be for owner occupied accommodation or renting, using data for England. The approach is based on a behavioral model related to health and housing issues. The forecasts indicate a substantial increase in demand, growing at a faster rate than the population as a whole. If supply does not rise to meet these demands, serious problems arise in the quality of life of, and cost of caring for, older people; with implications for health care and social services. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{provision}} of appropriate housing {{for individuals with}} a mental illness has been recognized {{by a number of}} researchers as a means to enhance effectiveness of treatment and rehabilitation services, to maintain treatment gains, and to decrease community opposition to deinstitutionalization. Whether community-based services, which are now meant to be the focus of treatment, are successful or not is crucially related to the nature and availability of <b>accommodation.</b> This <b>paper</b> argues a case for change in the current philosophical basis of, and services provided by, mental health professionals and agencies that are charged with the responsibility of meeting the housing needs of consumers of mental health services. This change, it is contended, needs to be to an approach that is more flexible, more supportive of the consumer, and in which the consumers are empowered to make decisions and choices about their housing needs...|$|R
40|$|The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) has {{released}} a Specialist Disability <b>Accommodation</b> Position <b>Paper</b> on Draft Pricing and Payments. This is the NDIA’s strategy {{to increase the}} long-term supply of housing for National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) participants. It aims to foster the development of innovative housing solutions. Young people with disability living in nursing homes {{are one of the}} most marginalised and isolated groups of people in our society. More than 6, 200 people under the age of 65 are stuck in nursing homes. Another 200 people under 50 are admitted to nursing homes each year. This is a serious social issue that can and must be fixed. The NDIS will provide crucial funding for the support that these people need to live in the community. However, the NDIS cannot on its own stop the inappropriate placement of young people in nursing homes. More accessible and affordable housing needs to be built. The policy outlined in NDIA Special Disability <b>Accommodation</b> position <b>paper</b> is designed to pay for the cost of housing for 28, 000 NDIS participants with high support needs. The housing payment rates set by the NDIA cover the high costs of development and ongoing maintenance required by people with disability. After decades of underinvestment, governments have made the funding available to replicate and scale a range of innovative housing and support options.  For people with disability who have the highest need for support and accessibility, the NDIS housing payment will bridge the gap between what people with disability can reasonably afford and the cost of building highly accessible housing. This policy lays the foundation for developing the range and scale of housing needed. The NDIS housing payment and policy provides a unique opportunity to trial some innovative, transformative financing models that could be used to fund social housing for other disadvantaged people, including a broader group of people with disability. The next step is for investors and the housing sector to come together and create the revolution in housing that young people in nursing homes have been waiting for...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The work {{described}} in this paper is of direct relevance to those {{with an interest in}} the phenomena surrounding ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) adoption by the rural <b>accommodation</b> sector. The <b>paper</b> provides the results from a preliminary study, which examined differences in the level of inter-firm technology adoption between rural and urban accommodation establishments within a major tourism destination, Scotland. Design/methodology/approach – A survey was conducted, and the results set out here suggested that these differences are only presented with two types of technology, i. e. systems requiring networking infrastructure, and sector-specific applications. Findings – The discussion suggests that the Neoclassical theory of growth and theory of development from below are contradictory but they complementarily explain different levels of adoption between rural and urban setting. Research Limitations/Implications – Not only theoretical, but also industry implications and suggestions for further research are presented. Originality/Value – Previous studies examining these phenomena within other industries suggested that rural businesses tend to have weaker technology adoption than those located in urban settings. However, they fail to provide any conclusive theoretical explanation for these differences.

40|$|Abstract: Universities face new {{challenges}} {{as they have}} to deal with an increasing number of disabled students attending their curricula. In Portugal, Higher Education Institutions (HEI) are still not prepared, as teaching and non-teaching staff face serious difficulties interpreting accessibility guidelines, and are not aware of their important role for providing <b>accommodations.</b> This <b>paper</b> presents the findings of the first national initiative on a HEI to help implementing an inclusive curriculum. We developed a course on accessibility and observed that staff had little or no training on how to deal with disabled students, although they were willing to learn how to adapt their curricula to this new reality. In conclusion, new courses and workshops on accessibility will have to be developed within the U. Porto to reach a larger and more diverse audience and thus contributing to build a barrier free community where all students can feel included...|$|R
40|$|Caravanning {{has been}} a popular leisure {{activity}} in Australia for many decades. In recent years the proﬁle of the industry has changed with a shift from family caravanning to retirees. This change has signiﬁcant implications for the industry overall {{as well as the}} regional areas visited by caravanners. This paper reports on research designed to develop a proﬁle of contemporary caravanning in Australia. One of the most signiﬁcant ﬁndings was the homogeneity of the respondents. The largest groups of respondents were 'empty nesters', people who were retired or near retirement and who were attracted to three clusters of activities: nature; shopping and eating; and visiting heritage attractions. Another major ﬁnding of interest for regional areas was the relatively low daily expenditure on food and <b>accommodation.</b> The <b>paper</b> discusses a range of options that may be used by regional areas to boost their caravan sector. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} in two parts. An {{introductory}} section discusses {{the housing market}} in Australia in order to emphasise the fact that homelessness is not simply an individual experience. It is also a structural phenomenon driven by economic imperatives {{beyond the control of}} those most affected. The bulk of the paper is devoted to a discussion of the published figures on the level of homelessness in Australia, gathered by the national Census and by the data collection agency for the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP), the nation`s main program for combating homelessness. Some problems with those figures as they are reported by the SAAP data collection agency are discussed, in particular, the under-estimation of the level of unmet demand for <b>accommodation.</b> The <b>paper</b> concludes with a comparison between the Census and the SAAP figures, which indicates that policies for alleviating homelessness are far from achieving their aims...|$|R

40|$|The {{protection}} {{and management of}} pioneer cemetery prairies is a daunting challenge. As the public has become accustomed to highly manicured grass in their backyard lawns, neighborhood parks and cemeteries, prairie cemeteries, with grasses three- to six-feet tall, are often thought to be abandoned or unkept even though the cemeteries retain their original vegetation. Caring for prairie plants, protecting cemetery stones, and providing public access need not be goals that stand in conflict.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{themes that}} emerge in discussion of Season 1 The Voice Australia's vision-impaired contestant Rachael Leahcar on The Voice Australia's official YouTube channel. The essay uses Pierre Lévy's conception of information utopia characterized by collective intelligence {{as a mechanism}} to examine the way representations of disability are responded to online. The paper outlines three broad themes {{that emerged in the}} available social media discourse about Leahcar's performances: first, themes that portray her as an inspirational sweet innocent, second, accusations that she had a competitive edge or ‘sob story’ that others could not compete with and, finally, that people with disabilities are entitled to compensation. Social media also offered Rachael Leahcar the opportunity to respond to criticisms that she was not disabled enough – a critique often levelled at people with disability seeking <b>accommodations.</b> This <b>paper</b> argues that although Rachael was broadly constructed and interpreted as a ‘supercripple’, the affordances available through both reality television and television's use of social media provide the opportunity to introduce a different type of representation that embraces both incidentalist and non-incidentalist ways of understanding disability...|$|R

40|$|The boom-bust cycles within {{resources}} {{industries in}} Australia {{make it difficult}} to plan for the sustainable development of workforce locations in regional communities. A variety of logistical, financial and lifestyle factors are contributing to an increased use of non-resident workforce for both short and long term construction, operational and maintenance, raising a number of issues about the sustainability of mining village accommodation and development that this encourages. Forward planning {{to meet the needs of}} resource industries and their workforce requires knowledge of accommodation alternatives and preferences, especially when seeking to attract skilled professionals to regional areas. This requires consideration of factors beyond the simple utility of temporary worker accommodation. Planning for a sustainable mining future involves consideration of the liveability of mining villages and the preferences of mining workers for appropriate <b>accommodation.</b> This <b>paper</b> will explore these issues and draw upon a recent survey of mining villages in the Bowen Basin region to shed light on three significant issues for non-resident workforces; location choices, accommodation choices, and the impact of these on regional economic and social development within the resources sector in regional Australia...|$|R
40|$|Following World War II, Australia {{was confronted}} by a severe {{shortage}} of dwellings. One relief valve for some cities was a stock of un-serviced building lots situated on the suburban fringe. In Sydney, Australia’s largest city, thousands of aspiring home-owners purchased such allotments but, affected by shortages of money and materials, could only construct a temporary dwelling. These homes ranged from shacks and garages to tram-cars, ex-army Nissen-huts and tents. The post-war phenomenon of such housing in Australia has been neglected both empirically and theoretically. This paper draws upon Sorensen’s suggestion of Historical Institutionalism {{in an attempt to}} pursue the theoretical challenge. The proposition explored is that the existence of temporary dwellings in Sydney was evidence of a critical juncture in the institutionalised regulation of housing, creating opportunities for policy change. Firstly, local authorities were forced to permit the occupation of dwellings which did not comply with existing ordinances, and secondly, they adapted their regulations to give permanent approval to sub-standard <b>accommodation.</b> The <b>paper</b> concludes by suggesting that these policy changes reverted to the institutionalised model for two reasons: path dependency and positive feedback mechanisms privileged those committed to an unchanged institution, while the permanent housing converged with adapted regulations...|$|R
40|$|There is much {{current policy}} and {{practitioner}} enthusiasm for using social enterprise {{to tackle the}} problems of the homeless population, particularly those in the most acute housing need such as rough sleepers, hostel users and those in other forms of temporary <b>accommodation.</b> This <b>paper</b> brings together two sets of research literature on social enterprise and homelessness to address the question ‘how does social enterprise respond to the needs of homeless people?’ The paper provides an overview of the current policy context before identifying different ways in which social enterprise responds to those homeless people in the most acute housing need. The research literature demonstrates that social enterprise involves balancing a tension between social and economic objectives. This poses challenges for social enterprises in the homelessness field. Existing case study research shows that social enterprises offering homeless people the opportunity to earn an income have proved unable to generate sufficient surplus to address the wider social support needs of their client group. Social enterprises contracted to deliver state services may face pressure to abandon those clients with the most complex needs as they prove unprofitable to work with. However social enterprise would appear to offer opportunities to those homeless people with less acute needs, particularly in conjunction with other Third Sector Organisations...|$|R
