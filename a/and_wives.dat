5|$|Su Dingfang {{recruited}} {{tribes to}} side with Tang, and these former tribal vassals of the Western Turks contributed additional soldiers. The tribe Chumukun offered their support after they were defeated by Su, and the tribe Nishu aided Su after their children <b>and</b> <b>wives,</b> originally captured by Helu, were returned along with gifts offered by the Tang.|$|E
5|$|In Heian-era Japan, husbands <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> kept {{separate}} households; {{children were}} raised with their mothers, although the patrilineal system was still followed. Murasaki was unconventional because {{she lived in}} her father's household, most likely on Teramachi Street in Kyoto, with her younger brother Nobunori. Their mother died, perhaps in childbirth, when the children were quite young. Murasaki had at least three half-siblings raised with their mothers; she {{was very close to}} one sister who died in her twenties.|$|E
5|$|During Team Canada's stay in Moscow, the team's {{treatment}} {{was the source}} of numerous complaints by the players. When leaving Sweden, the team was informed that the players would stay at one hotel, their wives at another. The players threatened not to go, and the arrangements were changed to keep the players <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> together at the Intourist Hotel. The players' wives were fed sub-standard food and the players would smuggle some of their food to their wives. The team had contracted to have Canadian beer and steaks delivered to them in Moscow. The beer was lost at the airport, while the steaks were cut in half. At a practice after game six, the Soviets tried to cut short the Canadians' practice.|$|E

50|$|Joseph Fouché, 1st Duc dOtrante (21 May 1759 Le Pellerin, near Nantes, France - 25 December 1820 Trieste, then Austrian Empire, now Italy) was {{a son of}} Julien Joseph Fouché (1719-1771) <b>and</b> <b>wife</b> Marie Françoise Croizet (1720-1793), {{paternal}} {{grandson of}} Julien Fouché (1667-1745, son of Ambroise Fouché <b>and</b> <b>wife</b> Jeanne Passedouet born in 1629) <b>and</b> <b>wife</b> Marguerite Chiron (1683-1723, daughter of Toussaint Chiron <b>and</b> <b>wife</b> Marguerite Leray, paternal granddaughter of Pierre Chiron <b>and</b> <b>wife</b> Marguerite Hillaire <b>and</b> maternal granddaughter of Samson Leray <b>and</b> <b>wife</b> Marguerite Caillaud) <b>and</b> maternal grandson of Jean Croizet (c. 1690 -, son of Guillaume Croizet born in 1649 and died in 1719 <b>and</b> <b>wife</b> Nicole Bebar) <b>and</b> <b>wife</b> Marie Chesneau.|$|R
5|$|Just as {{the image}} of the wife in {{advertising}} has reflected the general views of the appropriate roles of a wife, images of the husband also reflect the cultural values surrounding what role was believed a husband should be engaged in. For example, over time, it is common find images of the husband as performing work outside of the home and taking care of the family finances. It has been noted that this role has been especially prevalent during 1920, 1936, and 1970. On the other hand, one is not likely to find an advertisement depicting husbands engaged in household chores, except when they are depicted as particularly bad at performing the housework. In addition, it has been noted that over time, the portrayal of husbands <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> in an intimate, romantic relationship has been on the rise.|$|E
5|$|Many {{events at}} the Queen's Hall were not {{presented}} by Newman. The hall was frequently let to organisations such as the Bach Choir and the Philharmonic Society (from 1903 the Royal Philharmonic Society), and later the London Choral Society and Royal Choral Society. The hall was used {{for a wide range}} of other activities, including balls, military band concerts under Sousa, lectures, public meetings, Morris dancing, Eurythmics and religious services. On 14 January 1896, the UK's first public film show was presented at the Queen's Hall to members <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> of the Royal Photographic Society by the maker of the Kineopticon and Fellow of the society, Birt Acres, and his colleague, Arthur Melbourne-Cooper. This was an improved version of the early Kinetoscope.|$|E
5|$|The film's soundtrack {{consists}} {{almost entirely}} of pre-World War I 78 rpm recordings of opera arias sung by the Italian tenor Enrico Caruso. This bold use, despite Caruso's variety of musical styles, constitutes a first for Allen. Opera has been used before in his work {{as an indicator of}} social class, such as in Husbands <b>and</b> <b>Wives</b> (1992). In Match Point, the arias and opera extracts make an ironic commentary on the actions of the characters and sometimes foreshadow developments in the movie's narrative. Furthermore, given Wilton's status as an introvert and opera enthusiast himself, the accompaniment emphasises his detachment from his crime.|$|E

25|$|Initiation may {{be thought}} of as an event which may help teens prepare {{themselves}} to be good husbands <b>and</b> <b>wives.</b> Where modernization is occurring, initiation is not taken so seriously as before, although there are still certain areas which still perform initiations.|$|E
25|$|Such measure {{represented}} a major shift, because custom marriages were often potentially or actually polygamous as against public policy, {{and were not}} recognized under the new law. The government reversed the position, as it {{realized that it was}} impossible to enforce the prohibition against polygamy <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> usually consented.|$|E
25|$|Scenes of Venus and Mars in Roman art often {{ignore the}} adulterous {{implications}} of their union, and {{take pleasure in}} the good-looking couple attended by Cupid or multiple Loves (amores). Some scenes may imply marriage, and the relationship was romanticized in funerary or domestic art in which husbands <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> had themselves portrayed as the passionate divine couple.|$|E

25|$|Along with {{property}} and ideology, social lives were also held in common. As an example, most kibbutz dining halls exclusively utilized benches, {{not as an}} issue of cost or convenience, but because benches were construed as another way of expressing communal values. In the beginning, some kibbutzim husbands <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> were discouraged from sitting together, as marriage was an expressed form of exclusivity.|$|E
25|$|Husbands <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> are not {{presumed to}} be in a {{fiduciary}} relationship; however, this may be easily established. Similarly, ordinary commercial transactions in themselves are not presumed to but can give rise to fiduciary duties, should the appropriate circumstances arise. These are usually circumstances where the contract specifies a degree of trust and loyalty or it can be inferred by the court.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, {{the most}} {{prominent}} government reforms regarding family law in a Muslim country were set in motion in the Somali Democratic Republic, which put women and men, including husbands <b>and</b> <b>wives,</b> on complete equal footing. The 1975 Somali Family Law gave men and women equal division of property between {{the husband and wife}} upon divorce and the exclusive right to control by each spouse over his or her personal property.|$|E

25|$|The first {{generation}} of Muslim immigrants, who are today mostly retired from the workforce, keep strong ties with their countries, where their families lived. In 1976, the government passed a law allowing families of these immigrants to settle; thus, many children <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> moved to France. Most immigrants, realizing that they couldn't or didn't {{want to return to}} their homeland, asked for French nationality before quietly retiring. However, many live alone in housing projects, having now lost their ties with their countries of origin.|$|E
25|$|In 1922, Mohtaram Eskandari {{created the}} {{patriotic}} women's organization. She {{was arrested and}} her house was burned. Zandokht Shirazi, another women activist, organized the Women's Revolutionary Association. During this early phase of the women's movement, the women who became involved were in general daughters, sisters <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> of well-known constitutionalists. In general too, they were from educated middle-class families. The low status of women and secret operation of many of their organizations and societies have somewhat limited the amount of data on the subject.|$|E
25|$|When she {{presented}} the petitions to the New York State Senate Judiciary Committee, its members {{told her that}} men were actually the oppressed sex because they did such things as giving women the best seats in carriages. Noting {{cases in which the}} petition had been signed by both husbands <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> (instead of the husband signing for both, which was the standard procedure), the committee's official report sarcastically recommended that the petitioners seek a law authorizing the husbands in such marriages to wear petticoats and the wives trousers.|$|E

25|$|Pakistan is {{a patriarchal}} society where {{men are the}} primary {{authority}} figures and women are subordinate. Gender {{is one of the}} organizing principles of Pakistani society. Patriarchal values embedded in local traditions, religion and culture predetermine the social value of gender. Islam heavily influences gender roles in particular. An artificial divide between production and reproduction, made by the ideology of sexual division of labor, has placed women in reproductive roles as mothers <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> in the private arena of home and men in a productive role as breadwinners in the public arena.|$|E
25|$|The {{best known}} case of {{possible}} homosexuality in ancient Egypt {{is that of}} the two high officials Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep. Both men lived and served under pharaoh Niuserre during the 5th Dynasty (c. 24942345 BC). Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep each had families of their own with children <b>and</b> <b>wives,</b> but when they died their families apparently decided to bury them together in one and the same mastaba tomb. In this mastaba, several paintings depict both men embracing each other and touching their faces nose-on-nose. These depictions leave plenty of room for speculation, because in ancient Egypt the nose-on-nose touching normally represented a kiss.|$|E
25|$|Increasingly harsh anti-polygamy {{legislation}} in the US led some Mormons to emigrate to Canada and Mexico. In 1890, LDS Church president Wilford Woodruff issued a public declaration (the Manifesto) announcing that the LDS Church had discontinued new plural marriages. Anti-Mormon sentiment waned, as did opposition to statehood for Utah. The Smoot Hearings in 1904, which documented that the LDS Church was still practicing polygamy spurred the LDS Church to issue a Second Manifesto again claiming that it had ceased performing new plural marriages. By 1910 the LDS Church excommunicated those who entered into, or performed, new plural marriages. Even so, many plural husbands <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> continued to cohabit until their deaths in the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
