25|$|In {{the first}} word geldi, the unmarked suffix -di {{indicates}} past tense. In the second word gelmiş, the suffix -miş also indicates past tense but indirectly. It may be translated into English with the added words obviously, apparently or as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand.</b> The direct past tense marker -di is unmarked (or neutral) {{in the sense that}} whether or not evidence exists supporting the statement is not specified.|$|E
25|$|I {{regard the}} applicant's {{undertaking}} as a marvel of enterprise, energy and pluck… he is allowed - if {{my view of}} the Act is correct - to make any profits that he can {{and they are not}} subject to investigation. But when he chooses, {{in the course of his}} economies, to economise at the expense of human life, when his economy involves the withholding from his employees of reasonable remuneration, or reasonable conditions of human existence, then, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> the Act, Parliament insists on the payment of the Excise duty.|$|E

25|$|Some {{languages}} have {{a distinct}} grammatical category of evidentiality {{that is required}} to be expressed at all times. The elements in European languages indicating the information source are optional and usually do not indicate evidentiality as their primary function — thus they do not form a grammatical category. The obligatory elements of grammatical evidentiality systems may be translated into English, variously, as I hear that, I see that, I think that, as I hear, as I can see, as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand,</b> they say, it is said, it seems, {{it seems to me}} that, it looks like, it appears that, it turns out that, alleged, stated, allegedly, reportedly, obviously, etc.|$|E

"The {{house will}} {{understand}} that there is no part of the Home Secretary's duty which throws greater responsibility upon him or is indeed more painful, then that which has to be exercised in connection with the prerogative of mercy. Of course, any man would be only too glad to find a scintilla of evidence or reason, or I might say to invent a reason, which would enable him to save a human life. But my duty, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> it, is to act in accordance with the law and the traditions of my office.|$|E
500|$|Eisenhower {{publicly}} stated {{his opposition}} in {{his press conference}} of March 26, 1953: [...] "The Bricker Amendment, as analyzed for me by the Secretary of State, would, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> it, in certain ways restrict the authority that the President must have, {{if he is to}} conduct the foreign affairs of this Nation effectively[...] [...] [...] [...] I do believe that there are certain features that would work to the disadvantage of our country, particularly in making it impossible for the President to work with the flexibility that he needs in this highly complicated and difficult situation." [...] Eisenhower's phrasing, [...] "as analyzed for me by the Secretary of State," [...] led Bricker and other conservatives to blame Dulles for misleading Eisenhower, and raised their suspicion that the Secretary of State was a tool of Eastern internationalist interests.|$|E

500|$|Orwell is {{best remembered}} for his {{political}} commentary as a left-wing anti-totalitarian. As he explained in the essay [...] "Why I Write" [...] (1946), [...] "Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> it." [...] To that end Orwell used his fiction {{as well as his}} journalism to defend his political convictions. He first achieved widespread acclaim with his fictional novella Animal Farm and cemented his place in history with the publication of Nineteen Eighty-Four shortly before his death. While fiction accounts for a small fraction of his total output, these two novels are his best-selling works, having sold almost fifty million copies in sixty-two languages by 2007—more than any other pair of books by a twentieth-century author.|$|E
500|$|The Fourteenth Amendment {{provides}} that children {{born in the}} United States become American citizens regardless of the citizenship of their parents. At {{the time of the}} amendment's passage, three Senators, including Trumbull,Mr. Cowan: [...] "I will ask whether it will not have the effect of naturalizing the children of Chinese and Gypsies born in this country?"Mr. Trumbull: [...] "Undoubtedly."...Mr. Trumbull: [...] "I understand that under the naturalization laws the children who are born here of parents who have not been naturalized are citizens. This is the law, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> it, at the present time. Is not the child born in this country of German parents a citizen? I am afraid we have got very few citizens in some of the counties of good old Pennsylvania if the children born of German parents are not citizens."Mr. Cowan: [...] "The honorable Senator assumes that which is not the fact. The children of German parents are citizens; but Germans are not Chinese; Germans are not Australians, nor Hottentots, nor anything of the kind. That is the fallacy of his argument."Mr. Trumbull: [...] "If the Senator from Pennsylvania will show me in the law any distinction made between the children of German parents and the children of Asiatic parents, I may be able to appreciate the point which he makes; but the law makes no such distinction; and the child of an Asiatic is just as much of a citizen as the child of a European." [...] the author of the Civil Rights Act, as well as President Andrew Johnson, asserted that both the Civil Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment would confer citizenship on such children at birth; however, Senator Edgar Cowan of Pennsylvania had a definitively contrary opinion.Mr. Cowan: [...] "...Therefore I think, before we assert broadly that everybody who shall be born in the United States shall be taken to be citizen of the United States, we ought to exclude others besides Indians not taxed, because I look upon Indians not taxed as being much less dangerous and much less pestiferous to a society than I look upon Gypsies. I do not know how many my honorable friend from California looks upon Chinese, but I do know how some of his fellow citizens regard them. I have no doubt that now they are useful, and I have no doubt that within proper restraints, allowing that State and the other Pacific States to manage them as they may see fit, they may be useful; but I would not tie their hands by the Constitution of the United States so as to prevent them hereafter from dealing with them as in their wisdom they see fit..."Mr. Johnson: [...] "...Who is a citizen of the United States is an open question. The decision of the courts and doctrine of the commentators is, that every man who is a citizen of the State becomes ipso facto a citizen of the United States; but there is no definition as to how citizenship can exist in the United States except through the medium of a citizenship in a State..." [...] These congressional remarks applied to non-citizens lawfully present in the United States, as the problem of unauthorized immigration did not exist in 1866, and some scholars dispute whether the Citizenship Clause applies to unauthorized immigrants, although {{the law of the land}} continues to be based on the standard interpretation. Congress during the 21st century has occasionally discussed revising the clause to reduce the practice of [...] "birth tourism", in which a pregnant foreign national gives birth in the United States for purposes of the child's citizenship.|$|E
2500|$|The Constitution {{does not}} {{guarantee}} us only {{the right to be}} correct, {{we have a right to}} be honest and in error. And the views that I have expressed in this pamphlet I expressed honestly. I believe they were right. The future will show whether or not I was correct, but under the laws, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> it, and under the Constitution, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> it, every citizen in this country has the right to express himself ... on public questions.|$|E

"The whole trouble, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> it, started {{because a}} Mr. Bratton, a white lawyer from Little Rock, Ark., was {{employed}} by sixty or seventy colored families {{to go to}} Elaine to represent them in a dispute with the white planters relative to the sale price of cotton."It referred {{to a report in}} the Commercial Appeal of Memphis, Tennessee on October 3 that quoted Bratton's father: ...|$|E

Martin Gardner writes: [...] "In recent years he (Truzzi) has become a personal friend of Uri Geller; not that he believes Uri has psychic powers, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> it, but he admires Uri for having made a fortune by pretending {{he is not a}} magician." ...|$|E

2500|$|Moore {{has called}} for banning Muslims from serving in Congress, {{described}} Islam as a [...] "false religion" [...] and made false claims about Sharia law in the United States. When asked by a reporter where in the United States that Sharia law was being practiced, Moore said [...] "Well, there's Sharia law, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> it, in Illinois, Indiana — up there. I don't know." [...] Asked {{if it was not}} an amazing claim for a Senate candidate to make, Moore said [...] "Well, let me just put it this way — if they are, they are; if they're not, they're not".|$|E
6000|$|He said {{it might}} be right for him to look as a friend on the [...] {{formation}} of a liberal government, having (<b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood)</b> [...] moderate but intelligible plans, without forming part of it. I [...] think this was the substance of what passed.|$|R
60|$|We {{watched the}} men curiously, {{and for my}} part with {{a certain sense of}} exultation because I fancied they knew the fate which was in store for them. They were all armed, fully accoutered, and should have been at their posts, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The etymological {{sense of}} [...] "absence of government" [...] {{is enough for}} me. We have to destroy the spirit of {{authority}} and {{the prestige of the}} laws. That's it. That would be the work of the free exam. The fools think that anarchy is disorder and that without government the society will always end in chaos. They don't conceive other order that the one imposed from the exterior by the terror of the weapons. The anarchism, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> it, is reduced to the free political exam. [...] ¿So what we must do? Educate the others and us. Everything is resumed in the free exam. That our children examine our laws and despise them! ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) {{awarded the}} winning {{paper in the}} nuclear and future flight field to a retired Austrian patent officer named Walter Dröscher and Jochem Häuser, a {{physicist}} and professor of computer science at the University of Applied Sciences in Salzgitter, Germany. They turned the theoretical framework of Burkhard Heim into a proposal for an experimental test for a propulsion device that is thought to theoretically be able to travel at rates faster {{than the speed of}} light. Hans Theodor Auerbach, a theoretical physicist and someone who has worked alongside Heim has stated that, [...] "As far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> it, Heim theory is ingenious," [...] and, [...] "I think that physics will take this direction in the future".|$|E
2500|$|Yet Orwell [...] "had felt what {{socialism}} {{could be}} like" [...] and, according to Bowker, unlike the writer John Dos Passos for example, [...] "who {{also had a}} friend killed in custody by the SIM (Servicio de Investigación Militar/Spanish Secret Police) in Spain, and reacted by deserting the Communists and shifting decidedly to the right, Orwell never did abandon his socialism: if anything, his Spanish experience strengthened it." [...] In a letter to Cyril Connolly, written on 8 June 1937, Orwell said, [...] "At last I really believe in Socialism which I never did before". A decade later he wrote: [...] "Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic Socialism, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> it." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was useless}} {{to argue with}} Jerry, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> by his tone, {{therefore}} I turned away, saying to myself that by trying to bite off too big a piece {{in the way of}} taking prisoners, we might find the tables turned very suddenly to our disadvantage.|$|R
