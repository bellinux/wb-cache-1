25|$|Controversy {{occurred}} when Barry suddenly departed {{the group with}} no public explanation on the program.

500|$|Despite Morello, Wilk and Commerford's {{involvement}} in Prophets of Rage, Commerford confirmed {{in an interview}} with Rolling Stone that Rage Against the Machine has not split up, explaining, [...] "We just do things our own way. Throughout our career, we never did what anyone wanted us to do. We never made the records people wanted us to make. We never played by the rules people wanted us to play by. And here we are, 25 years later, still a band. Clearly that means something. And if we did ever play or make new music or anything, {{it would be a very}} big deal. And there's a lot of bands that I've seen come along during that 25-year period that did everything the record companies and the powers-that-be wanted them to do, and they sold millions of records. But where <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>now?</b> They're gone." [...] Morello added, [...] "Right now...the cold embers of Rage Against the Machine are now the burning fire of Prophets of Rage. Where Rage Against the Machine lives, is this summer in these songs that we are playing. And we have nothing but the greatest love and honor and respect for Zack de la Rocha, the brilliant lyricist of Rage Against the Machine, who is working on his own music, which I'm sure will be fantastic—he's a great artist in his own right. But where you're going to hear Rage Against the Machine is in Prophets of Rage." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{recurring}} feature was [...] "Stump the Chumps," [...] {{in which}} the hosts revisited a caller from a previous show to determine the accuracy and the effect, if any, of their advice. A similar feature began in May 2001, [...] "Where <b>Are</b> <b>They</b> <b>Now,</b> Tommy?" [...] It began with a comical musical theme with a sputtering, backfiring car engine and a horn as a backdrop. [...] Tom then announced who the previous caller was, followed by a short replay of {{the essence of the}} previous call, preceded and followed by harp music often used in other audiovisual media to indicate recalling and returning from a dream. [...] The hosts then greeted the previous caller, confirmed that they had not spoken since their previous appearance and asked them if there had been any influences on the answer they were about to relate, such as arcane bribes by the NPR staff. [...] The repair story was then discussed, followed by a fanfare and applause if the Tappet Brothers' diagnosis was correct, or a wah-wah-wah music piece mixed with a car starter operated by a weak battery (an engine which wouldn't start) if the diagnosis was wrong. [...] The hosts then thanked the caller for their return appearance.|$|E
