40|$|Infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) is the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} the disease by the same name <b>and</b> <b>causes</b> <b>major</b> <b>losses</b> in the salmon industry worldwide. Epizootic ISAV outbreaks have occurred in Norway and, to a lesser degree, in Canada. In 2007, an ISAV outbreak in Chile destroyed most of the seasonal production and endangered the entire Chilean salmon industry. None of the existing prophylactic approaches have demonstrated efficacy in providing absolute protection from or even a palliative effect on ISAV proliferation. Sanitary control measures for ISAV, based on molecular epidemiology data, have proven insufficient, mainly due to high salmon culture densities and a constant presence of a nonpathogenic strain of the virus. This report describes an alternative treatment approach based on interfering peptides selected from a phage display library. The screening of a phage display heptapeptide library resulted {{in the selection of}} a novel peptide with significant in vitro antiviral activity against ISAV. This peptide specifically interacted with the viral hemagglutinin-esterase protein, thereby impairing virus binding, with plaque reduction assays showing a significant reduction in viral yields. The identified peptide acts at micromolar concentrations against at least two different pathogenic strains of the virus, without detectable cytotoxic effects on the tested fish cells. Therefore, antiviral peptides represent a novel alternative for controlling ISAV and, potentially, other fish pathogens...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Blueberry is {{a member}} of the Ericaceae family, which also {{includes}} closely related cranberry and more distantly related rhododendron, azalea, and mountain laurel. Blueberry is a major berry crop in the United States, and one that has great nutritional and economical value. Extreme low temperatures, however, reduce crop yield <b>and</b> <b>cause</b> <b>major</b> <b>losses</b> to US farmers. A better understanding of the genes and biochemical pathways that are up- or down-regulated during cold acclimation is needed to produce blueberry cultivars with enhanced cold hardiness. To that end, the blueberry genomics database (BBDG) was developed. Along with the analysis tools and web-based query interfaces, the database serves both the broader Ericaceae research community and the blueberry research community specifically by making available ESTs and gene expression data in searchable formats and in elucidating the underlying mechanisms of cold acclimation and freeze tolerance in blueberry. Description BBGD is the world's first database for blueberry genomics. BBGD is both a sequence and gene expression database. It stores both EST and microarray data and allows scientists to correlate expression profiles with gene function. BBGD is a public online database. Presently, the main focus of the database is the identification of genes in blueberry that are significantly induced or suppressed after low temperature exposure. Conclusion By using the database, researchers have developed EST-based markers for mapping and have identified a number of "candidate" cold tolerance genes that are highly expressed in blueberry flower buds after exposure to low temperatures. </p...|$|R

The behavior of workers divided into three domain, which consists of knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP). KAP measurements identify what is known and done by workers and how the theirs attitude in performing their daily work. The aims of this study were to determine the level of KAP of safe behavior and to indentify the relationship between knowledge, attitude, practice safe behaviors of workers. Data obtained by conducting interviews and distributing questionnaires to 41 workers in West Assembly unit at PT. XYZ. The contingency coefficient was used to calculate the strength of the relationships among variables. The results of this study showed that there is a moderate relationship between knowledge and the the attitude of safe behavior (R: 0, 405), the very low relationship between knowledge and action of safe behavior (R: 0, 042), and attitude and practice of safe behavior (R: 0, 087).

Despite their significant impact, the pathogenicity mechanisms of these bacteria are not yet completely understood. In this study, the impact of indole signalling on the virulence of Vibrio campbellii was investigated. Elevated indole levels significantly decreased motility, biofilm formation, exopolysaccharide production and virulence to crustacean hosts. Indole furthermore inhibited the three-channel quorum sensing system of V. campbellii, a regulatory mechanism that is required for full virulence of the pathogen. Further, indole signalling was found {{to interact with the}} stress sigma factor RpoS. Together with the observations that energy-consuming processes (motility and bioluminescence) are downregulated, and microarray-based transcriptomics demonstrating that indole decreases the expression of genes involved in energy and amino acid metabolism, the data suggest that indole is a starvation signal in V. campbellii. Finally, it was foundthat the auxins indole- 3 -acetic acid and indole- 3 -acetamide, which were produced by various (micro) algae sharing the aquatic environment with V. campbellii, have a similar effect as observed for indole.

We propose a novel approach to minimizing the spread of an invasive species given a limited intervention budget.

We use this to obtain an optimal intervention plan based on an integer programming formulation, and compare the optimal plan against several ecologically-motivated heuristic strategies used in practice. We present an empirical study of two variants of the invasive control problem: minimizing the final rate of invasions, and minimizing the number of invasions {{at the end of}} a given time horizon. Our results show that the optimized intervention achieves nearly the same level of control that would be attained by completely eradicating the species, with a 20 % cost saving. Additionally, we design a heuristic intervention strategy based on a combination of the density and life stage of the invasive individuals, and find that it comes surprisingly close to the optimized strategy, suggesting that this could serve as a good rule of thumb in invasive species management...|$|R

In this study, we characterized the genetic program activated during penetration of the plant by the soil-borne pathogen Phytophthora parasitica. Results: Using all the P. parasitica sequences available in public databases, we generated a custom oligo-array and performed a transcriptomic analysis of the early events of Arabidopsis thaliana infection. We characterized biological stages, ranging from the appressorium-mediated penetration of the pathogen into the roots to the occurrence of first dead cells in the plant. We identified a series of sequences that were transiently modulated during host penetration. Surprisingly, we observed an overall down regulation of genes encoding proteins involved in lipid and sugar metabolism, and an upregulation of functions controlling the transport of amino acids.

It occurs world-wide <b>and</b> <b>causes</b> <b>major</b> <b>losses</b> in the industry. It {{is caused by a}} protozoon belonging to genus Eimeria. Many studies have been conducted to investigate means to control this disease. Nutrition has been established {{to have an impact on}} the severity of the disease and the disease affects nutrient absorption and utilisation. One phase in the life cycle of the parasitic agent is dependent on digestive proteases and this was the basis in developing the hypothesis of this study. Raw soybean, which contains protease inhibitors, was investigated as an inhibitor of the protease required by the coccidia in the excystation process of its oocyst. In this study, different levels of raw soybean inclusion in the diet of broiler chickens infected with Eimeria acervulina were utilised to substitute for the processed soybean meal in the rations as a main protein source for the birds. Two hundred and fifty two day old male broiler chicks were maintained under uniform management throughout the experiment. They were exposed to two different E. acervulina inoculation levels (100, 000 and 300, 000 oocysts) at 17 days of age. Three dietary treatments providing raw soybean inclusion of 7, 14 and 21 % of the total diet, were compared with a commercial coccidiostat-free diet. The results of this experiment demonstrated that raw soybean can reduce the severity of the coccidia infection, as evidenced by reduced intestinal lesions in the birds given raw soybean inclusion compared with the commercial diet groups. The number of oocysts produced, as measured in the droppings, was also substantially lower in the former groups. The live weight gain of those birds given raw soybean was also higher than that of the birds given the commercial diet. In addition, there was no reduced feed conversion ratio or difference in digesta viscosity observed among treatment groups. However, the pancreas of the birds provided with raw soybean diets was enlarged when compared to that of birds fed the commercial diet. These results indicate that there was a physiological response to the raw soybean diet, as evidenced by the positive effect of the soybean inclusion in reducing the severity of the coccidia infection, and this beneficial effect offset any adverse nutritional effects. Further studies are required to provide a strategic basis for use of natural dietary protease inhibitors during a period of development of tolerance or resistance to coccidial infestation. These might include studies on the alternative age of the chickens when given the natural inhibitors and the optimum concentration of the raw soybean at which it produces no adverse effect whilst reducing the severity of coccidiosis.

Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to determine the cutoff point for P-ELISA. Based on C-ELISA results, the area under the curve for P-ELISA was 0. 913 (95 % CI, 0. 883 to 0. 943). Using a cutoff point of 0. 100, P-ELISA showed a sensitivity of 62. 0 % and a specificity of 93. 7 %. The kappa value and the percent agreement between the two ELISAs were 0. 322 and 92. 5 %, respectively. Both ELISAs showed a significant correlation between age and seropositivity (p < 0. 01).

40|$|Research {{aimed at}} {{optimising}} diagnostic laboratory procedures {{is central to}} the development of effective bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) control programmes. BVDV is a singlestranded RNA virus that crosses the placenta to infect foetuses, resulting in reproductive losses due to foetal death or persistently infected calves that die early in life. Persistently infected animals are widely accepted to be the primary reservoir of BVDV and the largest source of infection. This poses important challenges to overall animal/herd health <b>and</b> can <b>cause</b> <b>major</b> <b>losses</b> to the cattle industry. Long-term storage of bovine ear notch samples from calves persistently infected with BVDV may adversely affect the ability of diagnostic assays to detect the virus efficiently. In order to test this hypothesis, ear notch samples from 7 animals were divided into 2 groups. One set was subjected to prompt formalin fixation and the other set stored either as fresh samples without preservatives at – 2 °C, or soaked overnight in phosphate buffered saline followed by freezing of the supernatant fluid at – 2 °C. Frozen ear notches and ear notch supernatant yielded positive results with an antigen- capture, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (AC-ELISA) {{for the duration of the}} study (6 months) and optical density (OD) values remained significantly within range.

30|$|The {{concept of}} beta-derivative and Caputo {{fractional}} derivative has assisted in investigating {{the spread of}} computer virus in a system. This computer virus has been found {{all over the world}} where computers are available <b>and</b> <b>causing</b> <b>major</b> financial <b>losses</b> to many establishments. It is worthy to note that the definition of fractional derivative is associated with the convolution of the derivative of a given function with its function power. Convolution is applied to many branches of engineering including image processing as a filter. Fractional derivative, however, in epidemiology serves a memory capable of tracing the spread from beginning to the infected individual. For beta-derivative which ranges between fractional order and local derivative, the spread of computer virus at local level is identified with a given fractional order. In this study, two distinct concepts of derivatives are employed to investigate the spread of computer virus. The proposed model based on the methodology used was solved iteratively. The numerical simulation results depict that the prediction is based on the fractional order of beta. Simply when beta is close to 1, we obtain non-realistic prediction which is not the case in [10] and when beta is ≤ 0.5, a good prediction is attained. Since it is the desire of any institution to have their computers with virus free, the initial computers {{at the end of the}} simulation moved into Anodotal section when beta is < 0.5 as observed in Figs. 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. It worthy to notice that when beta is 1, we have ordinary differential derivative cases for both derivatives which do not provide a good prediction. Thus, with the newly introduced, beta-calculus has the potential of providing a vivid account of physical problem more precisely.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Fasciol{{a hepatic}}a is a hepatic {{trematode}} which develops fasciolosis mostly in sheep and cattle and occasionally in humans. F. hepatica is an endemic parasite in Turkey <b>and</b> <b>causes</b> <b>major</b> economic <b>losses</b> in livestock industry. Human are infected by contaminated water or ingestion of uncooked aquatic vegetation on which metacercaria are encysted. In {{the diagnosis of}} human infection, in addition to investigate for the F. hepatica eggs in stool, various serological methods are also used. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the incidence of anti-Fasciola hepatica antibodies in 347 high school students from 28 different countries studying in Kayseri city. Method: In our study, anti-F. hepatica antibodies were investigated in serum samples taken from 347 male students ages ranging between 15 and 21 (average: 17. 52 ± 1. 36) {{in a high school}} in Kayseri by using the IHA method. In seropositive subjects the occurrence of parasite’s eggs was investigated in stool samples using the native-lugol method. For statistical evaluations, Chi-square test was performed by using SPSS (V. 11. 0) software package for Windows and p < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: In the study, 12 (3. 5 %) of the students were determined as seropositive in the 1 / 320 dilution, but F. hepatica eggs were not found in their stool samples. Seropositivity rates for F. hepatica among the students coming from Caucasian, European, Asian and African countries were determined as 1. 8 %, 3. 5 %, 4. 8 % and 5. 4 % respectively. Conclusion: Fasciolosis, which is a major public health problem in Turkey, was found in the serum of {{a small part of the}} group of foreign students studied in a high school in Kayseri. Considering the epidemiology of the disease, people should be informed about the control and prevention methods...|$|R

The separate components of this sum are provided. The reference to the consequence of political decisions by governments includes massive starvation resulting from government campaigns <b>and</b> not natural <b>causes,</b> <b>major</b> <b>loss</b> of life in internment or work camps systems, and instances of genocide. - The monograph then includes summaries {{of the events that}} took place in Somalia, Bosnia, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo since 1990, and since 2003 in the Darfur province of Sudan. It analyzes the nature of the response or non-response to these by the international community. These sections demonstrate that by far the greater portion of loss of life in these events could have been prevented by different international policies both prior to and during the crisis phases of these events. - Finally, the monograph concludes with an analysis of the problem of international intervention...|$|R
25|$|In 1984, {{infectious}} salmon anemia (ISAv) {{was discovered}} in Norway in an Atlantic salmon hatchery. Eighty percent of {{the fish in the}} outbreak died. ISAv, a viral disease, is now a major threat to the viability of Atlantic salmon farming. It is now the first of the diseases classified on List One of the European Commission’s fish health regime. Amongst other measures, this requires the total eradication of the entire fish stock should an outbreak of the disease be confirmed on any farm. ISAv seriously affects salmon farms in Chile, Norway, Scotland <b>and</b> Canada, <b>causing</b> <b>major</b> economic <b>losses</b> to infected farms. As the name implies, it causes severe anemia of infected fish. Unlike mammals, the red blood cells of fish have DNA, and can become infected with viruses. The fish develop pale gills, and may swim close to the water surface, gulping for air. However, the disease can also develop without the fish showing any external signs of illness, the fish maintain a normal appetite, and then they suddenly die. The disease can progress slowly throughout an infected farm and, in the worst cases, death rates may approach 100 percent. It is also a threat to the dwindling stocks of wild salmon. Management strategies include developing a vaccine and improving genetic resistance to the disease.|$|R
