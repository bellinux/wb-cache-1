40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the NASA-Ames 40 by 80 Foot Wind Tunnel to determine the aerodynamic characteristics of a large scale, VTOL, <b>lift</b> <b>fan,</b> jet transport model. The model had two <b>lift</b> <b>fans</b> at the forward portion of the fuselage, a <b>lift</b> <b>fan</b> at each wing tip, and two lift/cruise fans at the aft portion of the fuselage. All fans were driven by tip turbines using T- 58 gas generators.

40|$|Taking {{advantage}} of ancient Indian Knowledge of Vimanas, the Mini Rukma Vimana Unmanned Air Vehicle designs make a several advantages for many purposes as mentioned. The MRV UAV concept is proposed mainly to create VTOL, the <b>lift</b> <b>fans</b> configuration similar to Rukma vimana, {{hence the name}} Mini Rukma vimana Unmanned Air Vehicle. <b>Lift</b> <b>fans</b> are {{the main part of}} the MRV UAV. They can be used to go through mountainous regions. And fans are preferred other than wings for Vertical takeoff. The <b>lift</b> <b>fans</b> configuration is similar to Rukma vimana Mentioned in Vimanika shasthra. Based on Analysis for VTOL, UAVs are having <b>lift</b> <b>fans</b> embedded in Wings. But MRV UAV has simpler configuration, enabling the UAV to <b>lift</b> off with <b>fans</b> provided at the top of the UAV directly connected to the base of UAV with the help of Ducts.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed at {{assessing}} a novel annular-ducted <b>fan</b> <b>lift</b> system for VTOL aircraft through {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) simulations. The power and lift efficiency of the <b>lift</b> <b>fan</b> system in hover mode, the lift and drag in transition mode, the drag and flight speed of the aircraft in cruise mode and the pneumatic coupling of the tip turbine and jet exhaust were studied. The {{results show that the}} annular-ducted <b>fan</b> <b>lift</b> system can have higher lift efficiency compared to the rotor of the Apache helicopter; the smooth transition from vertical takeoff to cruise flight needs some extra forward thrust to overcome a low peak of drag; the aircraft with the <b>lift</b> <b>fan</b> system enclosed during cruise flight theoretically may fly faster than helicopters and tiltrotors based on aerodynamic drag prediction, due to the elimination of rotor drag and compressibility effects on the rotor blade tips; and pneumatic coupling of the tip turbine and jet exhaust of a 300 m/s velocity can provide enough moment to spin the <b>lift</b> <b>fan.</b> The CFD results provide insight for future experimental study of the annular-ducted <b>lift</b> <b>fan</b> VTOL aircraft...|$|R
