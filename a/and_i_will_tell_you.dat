6000|$|BEGGAR [...] Do {{not harm}} me, [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> all!--You know not, Sir, [...] What strong temptations press upon the Poor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come {{down and}} help us to tie up this cursed boat <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> You know where the post is, and we can't find it." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{that was}} one of our last {{enterprises}} before our great crisis, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> of it in its place.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you give}} me five hundred francs now," [...] I insisted, [...] "and another five hundred {{when you have the}} man, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Be brave, dear, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you." [...] <b>And</b> in {{somewhat}} choky tones, he recounted {{word for word}} what had passed between her father and himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} will wait till after dinner. The things are here now. Go up-stairs and take off your hat, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> after dinner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Rowan," [...] he said, [...] "be brave <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{some good}} news. See, {{you can read}} it for yourself. The reprieve is signed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Neither, Macumazahn, {{for these}} are my own cattle. Listen, now, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> a story. You have heard of Matiwane, {{the chief of the}} Amangwane?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely he {{also will}} be honoured," [...] exclaimed the old fellow with a cackle. [...] "He's {{a friend of mine}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> him the jest." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Not {{a man of}} them," [...] said Hatton peremptorily. [...] "Tell me one {{of their}} names, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> whether they will be made peers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, my dear boy," [...] she said, [...] "you may {{ask what}} {{questions}} you choose, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> very briefly {{how you have}} come here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You put me out, {{standing}} there {{staring at me}} through your horrid spectacles!" [...] she said irritably. [...] "Don't look at me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> directly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come {{out with}} us, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you." [...] <b>And</b> Campbell threw down the money, {{and led him}} off, after he had gulped down his own brandy, and half Tom's beside.|$|R
6000|$|... "You shall call a policeman. Send for the gentleman, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> the Lord Mayor what I {{think of}} Sir Barnes Newcome, Baronet. Mr. Boltby, shall {{we have the}} constable in?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] says William, [...] "I am not {{designing}} to {{part from}} thee, {{unless it is}} thy own doing. But assure me in all these points, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> my mind freely." ...|$|R
60|$|Won't {{you come}} and meet me after the show to-morrow night, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> all about it? I should like so much to see you again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] {{he said at}} last, seizing {{his friend}} {{by the arm and}} looking earnestly into his eyes. [...] "Listen, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> all about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Enchanted it is, they say; but its maker, who can tell? My {{ancestor}} won it, and by {{the side}} of Charles Martel. Listen, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> how.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sing to {{me again}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you," [...] he said. [...] "If Luud would let me have you, you should never die. I should keep you always to sing to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} the fisherman, [...] "if I trust myself to you I am afraid you will treat me as a certain Greek king treated the physician Douban. Listen, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then,' cried Bernez, 'I will {{divide the}} jewels amongst {{everybody}} in the world, {{so that they may}} be wealthy <b>and</b> happy; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> them that it is Rozennik who would have it so.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have simply}} {{tried to be}} candid with you. You know exactly how I stand. If I have omitted anything, ask me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Help me," [...] he begged. [...] "You can if you will. Give me your {{confidence}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> something which I {{think that even}} you do not know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Absurd," [...] she murmured, and {{inclined}} {{her head}} towards the billiard-table. [...] "They have been--attached {{to one another}} always. Come over here to the window, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait a while <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you." [...] <b>And,</b> {{taking a}} lamp, {{he left the}} room, {{returning}} presently with a letter which was written in cipher, and translated upon another sheet in John Castell's own hand.|$|R
5000|$|... "Cyclops, {{you asked}} my noble name, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> it; {{but do you}} give the strangers gift, just as you promised. My name is Nobody. Nobody I am called by mother, father, and by all my comrades.|$|R
60|$|There was one incident, however, {{that stands}} out very clearly in my memory. I think {{that it must have}} {{happened}} about the February of this year, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> it to you before I go any further.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] she said. [...] "Se√±or Ramirez will dine with us one evening, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{when the}} time is fixed. I don't know about Don Arturo yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will leave}} nothing to chance," [...] Mr. Dunster continued. [...] "Send {{this man who}} seems to have {{constituted}} himself my jailer out of earshot, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> even more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me {{whom you}} go with, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what you are," [...] says the proverb. [...] "Show me your dwelling, and I shall see your character," [...] say I.|$|E
60|$|Con. Ah, do not cease! say on! There {{is that in}} {{the music}} of thy voice that soothes and comforts me. Come, sit beside me, fair Ione, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> thee why <b>I</b> do not love thy princess.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not blame}} you so much," [...] said Henrietta, {{suffering}} him to place {{her head on}} his shoulder; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>will</b> never speak to Agatha again. She has behaved shamefully to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> her so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well then," [...] quoth Robin, [...] "list thou <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell,</b> but bear thyself up bravely, for {{the news}} is sad, I wot. Thus it is: I hear that two tinkers are in the stocks for {{drinking}} ale and beer!" ...|$|R
