5|$|Buildings play <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> gameplay, as {{they are}} used for {{training}} civilian and military units, researching improvements, supporting population, providing structural defense or as resource providers. The buildings portrayed in Age of Empires III resemble the architectural design of that era. All of the games in the series share several buildings, including the Town Center and Docks. The appearance and attributes of a building change as the player advances through the Ages, and some civilizations have their own unique buildings. The appearance of these buildings depends on the civilization. Some buildings can only be built at certain times like the defensive towers.|$|E

5|$|In 1937, {{when the}} {{government}} required that Hindi be taught {{in the school system}}, E.V. Ramasamy organised opposition to this policy through the Justice Party. After 1937, the Dravidian movement derived considerable support from the student community. In later years, opposition to Hindi played <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the politics of Tamil Nadu. The fear of the Hindi language had its origin in the conflict between Brahmins and non-Brahmins. To the Tamils, acceptance of Hindi in the school system was a form of bondage. When the Justice Party weakened in the absence of mass support, E.V. Ramasamy took over the leadership of the party after being jailed for opposing Hindi in 1939. Under his tutelage the party prospered, but the party's conservative members, most of whom were rich and educated, withdrew from active participation.|$|E

Liu Quiyi (劉揆一), Jiao Dafeng (焦達峰), Zhang Boxiang (張伯祥) and Sun Wu (孫武) established Gongjinhui (Progressive Association) (共進會). In January 1911, the revolutionary group Zhengwu Xueshe (振武學社) was renamed as Wenxueshe (Literary society) (文學社). Jiang Yiwu (蔣翊武) was chosen as the leader.

25|$|Music (or Mezmur in Amharic, the Ethiopian {{national}} language) plays <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> {{preaching and}} the daily life of Ethiopian P'ent'ay Christians.

25|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that gender {{stereotyping}} plays <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> influencing women’s academic and career aspirations by reducing their interest in male-typed occupations like engineering, leadership and mathematics. In a 2002 study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, a group of researchers found that gender-stereotypic television commercials can restrain women academically and professionally. Exposure to the stereotypic commercials resulted in women underperforming on a subsequent math test and avoiding math items in favor of verbal items. Furthermore, the women who viewed the stereotypic commercials expressed less interest in quantitative fields and more interest in verbal domains, both academically and professionally.|$|E

Phillips played <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> 12th-seeded Detroit's upset over 5th-seeded UCLA, 56–53, during the opening round game. Just like the season before when they scored a major upset to open the tournament, Detroit then found itself on the losing end in the round of 32, this time at the hands of 4th-seeded Ohio State. At the end of the 25–6 season, Phillips was named to the All-MCC First Team.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued the {{attitude}} of the East towards innovation is one of the other factors that might have played <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the West's advancements over the East. According to David Landes, after a few centuries of innovations and inventions, it seemed like the East stopped trying to innovate and began to sustain what they had. They kept nurturing their pre-modern inventions and did not move forward with the modern times. China decided to continue a self-sustaining process of scientific and technological advancement {{on the basis of their}} indigenous traditions and achievements. The East’s attitude towards innovation showed that they focused more on experience, while the West focused on experimentation. The East did not see the need to improve on their inventions and thus from experience, focused on their past successes. While they did this, the West was focused more on experimentation and trial by error, which led them to come up with new and different ways to improve on existing innovations and create new ones.|$|E

Shanahan also picked up an Olympic gold medal in Salt Lake City with Team Canada and was named to the Second NHL All-Star Team. The season was also of particular statistical significance for Shanahan, as shortly preceding his Olympic gold medal victory, he recorded his 1,000th point in the NHL after scoring two goals against Marty Turco in a 4–2 victory over the Dallas Stars on January 12, 2002. Then, later in the season, Shanahan also reached the 500-goal mark, scoring the game-winner against Patrick Roy in a 2–0 victory over Colorado on March 23. The win also marked a team accomplishment as it clinched a Presidents' Trophy as the top ranked regular-season team.|$|E
