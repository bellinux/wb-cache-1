25|$|I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> {{transmit}} to Your Lordship the disagreeable {{account of a}} disagreeable Business, {{some time in the}} Beginning of this Month, upon news of the Rebel Army approaching, General Carleton set out for Montreal in great Haste; the 7th instant the Rebels landed in the Woods near St. John's, and beat back to their Boats by a Party of Savages incamped at that Place; in this Action the Savages behaved with great Spirit and Resolution, and had they remained firm to our Interests, probably the Province would have been safe for this Year, but finding the Canadians in General averse to the taking up Arms for the Defence of their Country, they withdrew, and made their Peace.|$|E
500|$|The Dark Blues had {{extended}} their {{lead to a}} length by the soap works before shooting Hammersmith Bridge two lengths ahead. [...] Although river traffic diverted the Cambridge boat, they remained in contention, two lengths behind Oxford. [...] At Barnes Bridge, the Dark Blues were a further length ahead, and continued to extend their lead until the flag-boat, which they passed six lengths ahead {{in a time of}} 20 minutes 56 seconds. [...] Oxford's victory, their eighth in a row, took their overall lead to 1510 in the event. Willan paid tribute to his cox: [...] "In conclusion, I must again testify to the splendid steering of Tottenham, who for the fifth and I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> say for the last time has contributed mainly to our victory over Cambridge." ...|$|E
500|$|Having {{originally}} {{agreed to}} serve {{for a year}} Gleeson wrote to Father Bernard Rawlinson, the senior Roman Catholic chaplain, in October 1915 requesting that he be relieved of duty stating that [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> be leaving the dear old Munster lads, but I really can't stand it any longer. I {{do not like the}} life, though I love the poor men ever so much". He became a curate at the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes in Dublin but requested permission from his Archbishop, William Walsh, to return to army service for another year. He was recommissioned in his previous rank on 15 May 1917 and would serve another two years. When the Royal Munster Fusiliers were transferred to the 48th Brigade, 16th (Irish) Division on 29 January 1918 Gleeson remained with the 1st Infantry Division.|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after the}} book's publication, Potter's ageing Mrs. Tiggy began {{showing signs of}} failing health. She wrote a friend on February 1, 1906, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> say I am upset about poor Mrs. Tiggy. She hasn't seemed well the last fortnight, and {{has begun to be}} sick, and she is so thin. I am going to try some physic but I am a little afraid that the long course of unnatural diet and indoor life is {{beginning}} to tell on her. It is a wonder she has lasted so long. One gets very fond of a little animal. I hope she will either get well or go quickly." [...] A few weeks later Potter chloroformed her beloved hedgehog and laid her to rest in the garden at the Potter family home at 2 Bolton Gardens, Kensington.|$|E
500|$|A {{detail of}} papal carabinieri (military police) led by Marshal Pietro Lucidi and Brigadier Giuseppe Agostini {{arrived at the}} Mortara {{apartment}} in Bologna soon after sunset on 23 June 1858. After asking a few questions about the family, Lucidi announced: [...] "Signor Mortara, I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> inform {{you that you are}} the victim of a betrayal", and explained that they were under orders from Father Feletti to take Edgardo as he had been baptised. Marianna screamed hysterically, ran to Edgardo's bed and shrieked {{that they would have to}} kill her before taking him. Lucidi said repeatedly that he was only following Feletti's orders. He reported afterwards that he [...] "would have a thousand times preferred to be exposed to much more serious dangers in performing my duties than to have to witness such a painful scene." ...|$|E
500|$|Fleming {{was a heavy}} smoker and drinker {{throughout}} his adult life, and suffered from heart disease. In 1961, aged 53, he {{suffered a heart attack}} and struggled to recuperate. On 11 August 1964, while staying at a hotel in Canterbury, Fleming went to the Royal St George's Golf Club for lunch and later dined at his hotel with friends. The day had been tiring for him, and he collapsed with another heart attack shortly after the meal. Fleming died at age 56 in the early morning of 12 August 1964—his son Caspar's twelfth birthday. His last recorded words were an apology to the ambulance drivers for having inconvenienced them, saying [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> trouble you chaps. I don't know how you get along so fast with the traffic on the roads these days." [...] Fleming was buried in the churchyard of Sevenhampton, near Swindon.|$|E

The two things seemed quite natural.|$|R

500|$|I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> inform your Excellency {{that this}} Country {{has got a}} severe stroke {{by the loss of}} Colonel Lochry and about one hundred (tis said) of the best men of Westmoreland County, {{including}} Captain Stockely & his Company of Rangers. They were going down the Ohio on General Clarke's Expedition, many accounts agree that they were all killed or taken {{at the mouth of the}} Miame [...] River. I believe [...] chiefly killed. This misfortune, added to the failure of General Clarke's Expedition, has filled the people with great dismay. Many talk of retiring to the East side of the Mountain early in the Spring. Indeed there is great reason to apprehend that the Savages, & perhaps the British from Detroit will push us hard in the Spring, and I believe there never were Posts—nor a Country—in a worse state of defence.|$|E
500|$|I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> {{say that}} {{difficulties}} have been started likely to occasion much trouble and perhaps ultimate defeat. {{it seems the}} Appellee [...] has the option of waging Battle and of challenging the Appellor [...] in single combat which if not accepted by the Appellor the suit is lost and, if accepted, and the Appellee can hold out from sun rise to sun set, then he wins the contest and claims his discharge, otherwise his election subjects him not only to a good threshing but also the pain of death into the bargain. It is rumoured here that is the plea intended {{to be set up}} by the Def. and unless we can devise any means by arguement to induce the Court not to allow it, I am very apprehensive our poor little Knight {{will never be able to}} contend the Battle with his brutish opponent.|$|E
500|$|Many of Potter's tales {{appealed to}} girls, but Mr. Tod {{had a strong}} {{following}} among boys, due perhaps to the lengthy fight {{at the end of}} the book accompanied by [...] "dreadful bad language". Six-year-old Harold Botcherby wrote to Potter asking if the fight between Tod and Brock was still raging. Potter replied; describing the end of the battle and the injuries to the combatants:I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> tell you they are still quarreling. Mr. Tod has been living in the willow till he was flooded out; at present he is in the stick house with a bad cold in his head. As for the end of the fight [...] Mr. Tod had nearly half his hair pulled out of his brush [...] and five bad bites, especially one ear, which is scrumpled up (like you sometimes see nasty old Tom Cat's ears). the only misfortune to Tommy Brock [...] he had his jacket torn and lost one of his boots. So for a long time he went about with one of his feet bundled up in dirty rags, like an old beggar man. Then he found the boot in the quarry. There was a beetle in the boot and several slugs. Tommy Brock ate them. He is a nasty person. He will go on living in Mr. Tod's comfortable house till springtime [...] then he will move off into the woods & live out doors [...] and Mr. Tod will come back very, very cautiously [...] & there will need to be a big spring cleaning!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The Saturday Review of 24 December 1859 {{strongly}} criticised {{the methodology}} of Darwin's calculations. On 3 January 1860, Darwin wrote to Hooker about it: [...] "Some of the remarks about the lapse of years are very good, & the Reviewer gives me some good & well deserved raps,—confound it I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> confess the truth. But it does not at all concern main argument." [...] A day later, he said to Lyell [...] "You saw I suppose Saturday Review: argument confined to Geology, but has given me some perfectly just & severe raps on knuckles." ...|$|E

[...] "I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> find that the situation of your domestic affairs renders it necessary for you to quit the service. It always gives me pain to part with an officer, but particularly so with one whose experience and attention have made him useful in his profession. I cannot in justice to you permit you to leave the army without expressing my approbation of your conduct upon every occasion since you joined me in 1776, and wish you success in the line of life which you have now embraced." [...] From December 25, 1782 to October 22, 1783 Proctor held a commission from Congress as major.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, Tony Blair {{announced}} a new judicial inquiry, the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, into the killing of 14 unarmed civil rights marchers in Derry in 1972. A previous investigation, the Widgery Tribunal, into the same event had been discredited. During {{the debate in the}} House of Commons, Trimble was one of few dissenting voices. He said [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> have to say to the Prime Minister that I think that the hope expressed by the hon. Member for Foyle (Mr. Hume) that this {{will be part of the}} healing process is likely to be misplaced. Opening old wounds like this is likely to do more harm than good. The basic facts of the situation are known and not open to dispute." [...] Reporting in 2010, The Saville Inquiry confirmed that all of the 14 killings and 13 woundings were unjustified.|$|E
2500|$|Following his {{re-election}} in the 1945 general election on 5 July, Herbert noted {{of the new}} Parliament that [...] "the surge of Socialism into the House of Commons was something to see." [...] The Labour Party, under Clement Attlee, had won 393 seats, and the Conservatives had won only 197. Herbert said of the newly elected Labour MPs that [...] "Arrogance, I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> say, remained. There was such a concerto of nastiness and hate and imbecile yelling, that I thanked God, many times, that I was an Independent and could be silent without disloyalty." [...] Herbert campaigned {{to ensure that the}} newly elected MPs realised the significance of private members' time. He prepared a number of private member's bills, including on betting reform, legal aid for the poor, a fairer voting system, and the abolition of decree nisi, among other things. However, [...] was unsuccessful in his first attempt to guarantee private members' time – later in the Parliament, it would be restored.|$|E
