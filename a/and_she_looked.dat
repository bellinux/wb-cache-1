500|$|The song's {{music video}} was shot from May 23 to 24, 2008 on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, with {{director}} Joseph Khan. American recording artist Britney Spears filmed a cameo appearance for the video on June 4 at the Warner Bros. lot in Los Angeles. An on set [...] "insider" [...] said that Spears' scene was short, only consisting of her driving in a passing car and waving {{to the other}} girls. On June 12, 2008 it was announced by MTV News that the cameo had been cut from the final video. Scherzinger was asked why Spears got cut from the video. She said: [...] "I honestly am not so sure. You shoot {{a lot of things}} when you do a video. Some things stay in but other things don't make the cut and Britney just didn't make it. I've seen a little clip of her performance <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> adorable so I really wish she was in it! Hopefully we'll work together in the future." [...] A short clip of the music video was released online on June 12, 2008; a day before the video's premiere on June 13, 2008 on FNMTV.|$|E
2500|$|According to Sherrod, {{she did her}} job {{correctly}} {{by taking}} the farmer to a white lawyer who she thought could help him, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> for another lawyer when needed. [...] Sherrod rejected claims that she was racist and said she [...] "went all out" [...] to help the man keep his farm. She said that the incident helped her learn to move beyond race, and she told the story to audiences to make that point.|$|E

[...] The next day I said, [...] "Say, 'peace.' [...] " [...] <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> right at me and answered, [...] "War!" [...] It's very strange." ...|$|E

2500|$|While Christina may {{not have}} been alone in her own time for {{choosing}} masculine dress (Leonora Christina Ulfeldt, for example, was known for dressing the same way), she also had physical features some described as masculine. According to Henry II, Duke of Guise, [...] "she wears men's shoes and her voice and nearly all her actions are masculine". When she arrived in Lyon, she again wore a toque and had styled her hair like that of a young man. It was noted that she also wore large amounts of powder and face cream. In one account she [...] "was sunburnt, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> like a sort of Egyptian street girl, very strange, and more alarming than attractive".|$|E

[...] `Come, Smoky,' I said sharply, and she started through again. [...] When she was about 10 feet in, the string caught up <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> over her {{shoulder}} as much as to say `what's holding us up there?' [...] The string loosened from the snag and she came on again. [...] By now the dust was rising from the shuffle of her paws as she crawled through the dirt and mold and I could no longer see her. [...] I called and pleaded, not knowing for certain whether she was coming or not. [...] At last, about 20 feet away, I saw two little amber eyes and heard a faint whimpering sound [...] [...] [...] at 15 feet away, she broke into a run. [...] We were so happy at Smoky's success that we patted and praised her for a full five minutes.” ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{came to know}} Ann {{first as}} a moviegoer. I’d walk into various movie theaters and see the white hair up above the stadium seating. That’s how you'd know she was there. People {{do all kinds of}} things to get noticed in politics, but Ann wasn't there for anyone but Ann. She was someone who loved the movies, loved the tactile {{experience}} of being in the movie theater, loved talking about movies, loved meeting filmmakers– I think she was more excited to meet filmmakers than foreign dignitaries. At the Texas Film Hall of Fame, she was as much a celebrity at that event as anyone honored. People paid money to see her as much as anyone else there. She would often ride down to Austin on the New York plane with the celebrities being honored. One year it was with Ethan Hawke. All she wanted to talk about, at the pre-party, was that [...] "Ethan Hawke is so cute." [...] She loved him. This was not something that could be faked. She was starstruck. She loved these guys … (Watching a clip from Terrence Malick’s [...] "Days of Heaven" [...] at a Hall of Fame ceremony), she is mesmerized by this image. I mean, her eyes are glued to that screen. Again {{this is not something that}} you can fake. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at me and she said [...] "I love the movies" [...] with this childlike voice, this passion. Standing next to me at that moment was not the former governor, a political swordsman... she was like all the rest of us, just someone who loved the movies. It’s a terrible loss for Texas in so many ways, but for the cultural community to have an advocate in that position, you don’t have that but once a generation, if you’re lucky."– ...|$|E
