5|$|Sir Douglas Mawson's air-tractor sledge was a {{converted}} fixed-wing aircraft {{taken on the}} 1911–14 Australasian Antarctic Expedition, the first plane {{to be taken to}} the Antarctic. Expedition leader Douglas Mawson had planned to use the Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane as a reconnaissance and search and rescue tool, and to assist in publicity, but the aircraft crashed heavily during a test flight in Adelaide, Australia, only two months before Mawson's scheduled departure date. The plane was nevertheless sent south with the expedition, after having been stripped of its wings and metal sheathing from the fuselage. Engineer Frank Bickerton spent most of the 1912 winter working to convert it to a sledge, fashioning brakes from a pair of geological drills and <b>a</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> from the plane's landing gear. It was first tested on 15November 1912 and subsequently assisted in laying depots for the summer sledging parties, but its use during the expedition was minimal.|$|E
25|$|The mockup {{shown in}} 1993 {{had a strong}} {{resemblance}} to the Buk airframe, but since the Indians became involved {{there have been some}} changes. An Indian magazine gave the specifications of the KS–172 in April 2004 as a core 6.01m long and 40cm in diameter with a wingspan of 61cm, with a booster of 1.4m, and 748kg total weight. It had a solid fuel tandem rocket booster capable of speeds up to , 12g manoevring, and an adaptive HE fragmentation warhead. Development would concentrate on the seeker head, autopilot, resistance to jamming and <b>a</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> with 3D thrust vector control (TVC).|$|E
500|$|Bickerton {{began work}} on the air-tractor sledge on 14 April 1912. His first job was to repair the sledge, which had been damaged in transit when a violent storm hit the Aurora. A giant wave had slammed into the crate {{containing}} the sledge, driving the fuselage [...] through its side. With the repair completed, Bickerton began the serious work of converting the plane into a sledge. He constructed brakes {{from a pair of}} geological drills, and <b>a</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> from the landing gear. Bickerton painted the engine and fuel tank black to absorb heat better and protect them from freezing. By June he had the engine running properly, and during a lull in the winds in early September he fitted the skis. Finally, he raised the fuselage [...] off the ground to allow the propeller free movement.|$|E

The basic configuration of the newly designed Tumbler included a 5.7-liter Chevy V8 engine, a truck axle for the rear axle, front tires by Hoosier (which are actually dirt racing tires used on the right rear of open wheel sprint cars), 4 rear 44/18.5-16.5 Interco Super Swamper TSL tires (44" [...] tall, 18.5" [...] wide, mounted on a 16.5" [...] wheel) and the suspension system of Baja racing trucks. The design and development process took nine months and cost several million dollars.|$|E
2500|$|The Japanese {{domestic}} market received the Type V edition starting in mid-2000. It included variable gear ratio steering (VGS), <b>a</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> that continuously changes steering ratio based upon vehicle speed and steering angle to provide improved handling. Honda announced the S2000 Type V on July 7, 2000 {{as the first}} system of its kind. The lock-to-lock steering ratio was reduced to 1.4 turns (stock is 2.4). Honda outfitted Type V cars with revised damper units, stabilizers and limited slip differentials to [...] "complement the VGS". Equipped cars came with a special steering wheel and a VGS badge on the rear.|$|E

50|$|These devices {{generally}} have <b>a</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> consisting of threads that move asymmetrically {{so as to}} generate a difference in lift of the longitudinal axis so the CanSat rotates {{in one way or}} another.

50|$|This is the {{one whose}} primary purpose is to collect and {{transmit}} data from the flight and weather conditions in real time to be processed by a ground station. CanSats in this category do not use <b>a</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> since its objective is not to fall at a particular point but to collect data while the descent (which is not usually controlled).

50|$|The Nile River {{is a major}} {{resource}} for the people living along it, especially thousands of years ago. The El Salha Archaeological Project discovered an abundance of evidence of an ancient boat that traveled the Nile River dating back to 3,000 years ago.

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>{{steering}}</b> quickener is used {{to modify}} the steering ratio of factory-installed <b>steering</b> <b>system,</b> which in turn modifies the response time and overall handling of vehicle.

On the other hand, the steering effort needed will greatly increase. If the automobile is equipped with power steering, overloading the power steering pump can also be a concern.|$|R
50|$|For {{ships with}} {{independent}} propulsion systems for each side, such as manual oars or some paddles, steering systems {{may not be}} necessary. In most designs, such as boats propelled by engines or sails, <b>a</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> becomes necessary. The most common is a rudder, a submerged plane located {{at the rear of}} the hull. Rudders are rotated to generate a lateral force which turns the boat. Rudders can be rotated by a tiller, manual wheels, or electro-hydraulic systems. Autopilot systems combine mechanical rudders with navigation systems. Ducted propellers are sometimes used for steering.|$|E
50|$|Hounds latest {{appearance}} {{has been}} that of a Jeep Wrangler during 2004 (the specific Jeep design, including the patented grill design, were licensed from DaimlerChrysler) - twenty years after his original appearance in Transformers. In contrast to the other toys in the line, Hound (and the later remolds/repaints) does not include <b>a</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system,</b> or a weapon which transforms into {{a part of the}} car. Instead the figure features working suspension, and the weapon is folded and stored in the spare wheel. Hound appeared as Alternators figure #3, but Binaltech figure BT-04.|$|E
50|$|Although the CLC {{is still}} {{based on the}} W203 platform, it was facelifted with an updated front and tail {{inspired}} by the W204 series C-Class. The refresh reworked the rear and front along with some other refinements and new details (Mercedes claimed around 1,100 components), including <b>a</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> borrowed from the SLK-Class and a revised suspension. Out of the sheetmetal of the CLC-Class, only the doors, roof and quarter panels were carried over from the C-Class Sportcoupé.
