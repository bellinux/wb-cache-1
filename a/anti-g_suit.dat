Its etiology remains obscure, but the 'sensory conflict' theory appears most plausible. No valid predictive tests of susceptibility exist and presently medication for prevention or mitigation of symptoms must be relied on. Adaptation/biofeedback techniques may prove useful. Cardiovascular 'deconditioning' may be effectively attenuated by use of <b>anti-g</b> <b>suits</b> or plasma expanding techniques.

It was found that human tolerance decreased after exposure to hypokinetic and hypogravic fields, but the magnitude of such reduction ranged from 0 to 30 percent for plateau G forces and 30 to 70 percent for time tolerance on sustained G forces. A logistic regression model of the probability of individuals with 25 percent reduction in +Gz tolerance after 1 to 41 days of hypogravic exposures was constructed. The estimated values from the model showed a good correlation with the observed data. A brief review {{of the need for}} in-flight centrifuge during long-duration missions was also presented. Review of the available data showed that the use of countermeasures (such as <b>anti-G</b> <b>suits,</b> periodic acceleration, and exercise) reduced the decrement in acceleration tolerance after long-duration space flights.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} body {{proportions}} {{of men and}} women from the Civilian American and European Surface Anthropometry Resource (CAESAR) project, completed in 2002, and discusses proportions that have implications for protective apparel. CAESAR was an attempt to characterize the body size and shape of the adult population of NATO countries. Four countries were surveyed: the United States of America and Canada (North America), The Netherlands, and Italy. North America was selected because it had the largest population in NATO and the most diversity. The Netherlands was selected because it had the tallest population in NATO. Italy was selected because its population was amongst the shortest. Men and women were sampled in approximately equal numbers. Stepwise Discriminant Analyses were done using the 97 onedimensional measurements collected in CAESAR. The results indicate an unprecedented separation of male and female body shapes. All three regions had at least 98. 5 % accuracy in predicting gender with seven or fewer measurements. Some important body proportion {{differences between men and women}} will impact the fit and effectiveness of many types of protective apparel such as: flight <b>suits,</b> <b>anti-g</b> <b>suits,</b> cold-water immersion suits, chem. -bio protective suits, etc. While women are smaller than men on average for many body measurements, women are larger than men in some important aspects.

50|$|A g-suit is {{a special}} garment and {{generally}} {{takes the form of}} tightly-fitting trousers, which fit either under or over (depending on the design) the flight suit worn by the aviator or astronaut. The trousers are fitted with inflatable bladders which, when pressurized through a g-sensitive valve in the aircraft or spacecraft, press firmly on the abdomen and legs, thus restricting the draining of blood away from the brain during periods of high acceleration. In addition, in some modern very high-g aircraft, the <b>Anti-g</b> <b>suit</b> effect is augmented by a small amount of pressure applied to the lungs (partial pressure breathing), which also enhances resistance to high G.

5000|$|... "Then the Sabres {{changed to}} another tactic. Individual pairs {{of their most}} {{experienced}} pilots would sit off to the side, and when combat was joined would pounce on the trailing aircraft of our group, and frequently shoot them down. ... My flight was flying to reinforce the strike group in the lead battle. As {{we got to the}} place of combat, the enemy were just finishing up moving out over the sea. Our side was also running out of fuel, and they were heading for home. As we got there, we could see an eight of Sabres coming right at us at the same altitude. Without thinking, I gave the command “Let’s attack them” and turned at a nearly 90 degree bank to wind up 600 meters behind this group. It was just as I got the leader in my sights and gave him a burst that I got a sensation of that something was behind me. That sensation made me turn right and look behind me, and what it was I do not know to this day. Perhaps I had seen something. But inexplicable as it was, there I now saw less than 100 meters behind me the huge nose of a Sabre and the blasts and tracers of its six machine guns firing at me. Without thinking, {{in the space of a}} few hundredths of a second I reacted automatically, and my MiG momentarily did a half roll, dropping into a dive. While in the dive, I looked back and saw a group consisting of three Sabres right behind me in a dive. ...I could have initiated a dive, but I have been told that the Sabre was heavier than the MiG, so it should dive better. Because of that, to dive wasn't an option. Then I saw right in front of me a cluster of saving clouds. My only choice was to head my aircraft towards one of them. Once inside the cloud, I made a very sharp turn of 90° to the left, I got out of the clouds and performed a right turn. I supposed that the lead Sabre would thought that my MiG kept on diving straight after getting out of the cloud. And that was exactly what happened. Now, below me, there were these three Sabres, which were looking for me downwards. Without losing not even a second, I jumped them. I have turned the wits. Now it was my turn to attack.But somehow they spotted me and immediately they split: the wingmen performed a diving turn to the left, and the leader a climbing right turn. This tactic allow them to neutralize my attack and to transform me into their prey: it was a trap. Whichever one I attacked, I would be forced to turn my tail to the others and then they would get me under fire. What was I to do? I could climb up and give battle, but I did not want to get into this interesting and advantageous situation: if you are going to do battle with strong pilots, with the Sabre wing commander, you had better be in a better position.It is true that they were 3, but it didn't matter to me: I was very self-confident in my skills and my MiG. But now, I should decide fast who I shall to attack. Should I attack the pair which was diving, or the Sabre which was climbing? If I would jumped the first ones, the latter would dive after me and he would shoot me down. That's why I choose the later, because it was closer and was making a climbing turn to the right. So, I dived and soon I put myself behind him, I aimed, and at a distance of about 600 meters, I opened up. To slow down and to hold my fire until to be closer it was impossible, because the two remaining Sabres could catch me. My shells struck the Sabre. Evidently, some of the projectiles should hit it close to the engine, because the aircraft began to leave a trail of dark-gray smoke. The Sabre began to descend, and later entered in a steep dive.I could not see all the fall, because when I looked back, I saw a couple of Sabres at 500 meters. A little bit more, and both would open fire with their 12,7 mm (0,50") machineguns.Evidently, that was when I made a mistake. I should increase my angle of climbing and drag the Sabres to high altitude, where the MiG had the advantage. But I came to that conclusion only a long time later. At that time I reversed my heading, passed over the Sabres and in a slight dive I led my aircraft to a small group of clouds. Once there I turned to the right and went I got out of them, I started a ‘Boyevoy Razvorot Turn’, a climbing turn with a roll angle of 40-50° to the left, but I didn’t found the Sabres below where I expect them to be, but behind at my left. ...I threw my aircraft in a dive, but instead of a sharp pull-up into a climb I began to slowly roll my aircraft into a flat dive. The Sabres, who didn’t expect that, stayed in the height, far above and behind.I dived to the right towards the hydroelectric station over the Yalu river station is referred in the Russian cartography as Suphun hydroelectric station, and as Suiho Dam/Reservoir in the American one - Note of the authors. This huge reservoir had a dam of 300 meters height and a power station which provided energy not only to half of Korea but also the whole North-East of China. Precisely it was the main target we should protect. Besides us, their defense consisted in a dozen of anti-aircraft batteries, which had the order to shoot at any airplane which get closer to the dam.I had the hope that the gunners of these batteries would help me to get these Sabres out of my tail. And that was what happened: the gunners accomplished their order to open fire at any intruder, and in front of me it appeared a dark cloud caused by the detonation of the anti-aircraft shells. I didn’t want to evade that cloud, because the Sabres would reduce the distance and they would shoot me down. At that moment I preferred to eventually die in the hands of my fellow gunners, rather than the bullets of the Sabres, so I headed for the very center of a cloud. The aircraft punched into the cloud. Once inside and away from the shell bursts I immediately swung the aircraft from side to side, up and down. Grabbing the stick, I pulled back on it. The results were that the wings fluttered a bit.But after several tens of seconds passed, suddenly I was once again out in the sunshine. The aircraft had punched through the black cloud. Behind and below me were the dam and the reservoir. Off to the left I could see the departing Sabres, having lost me in the cloud and perhaps figured I was dead. Following me had proven to be useless, the sea was near, and not wanting a new fight, even though I had come close to passing out from the stress. In order to not lose consciousness I focused my attention in front of me and pinched the arteries in my neck, as I did not want the blood to leave my head. It was far easier for the Sabre pilots to take this stress - they had a special <b>anti-G</b> <b>suit</b> which, when it sensed increased stress on the pilot, filled with air and, grasping him tightly, prevented the blood from leaving his head. Up until then our designers had never thought of such an idea.I circled the airfield a couple of times, landed and then, taxiing over to the hardstand, saw my wingmen. They, having lost me during the sharp turn, continued to go after the eight Sabres, but when they got to the coastline had to turn back, searched for me, and not finding me, returned to the airfield.Subsequent examination of my gun camera footage showed good hits on the Sabre. Ground command reported where it had impacted.” ...|$|E
40|$|Little {{physiologic}} data {{exist on}} the effects of long duration, low onset, hypergravity (+G). Space shuttle crewmembers are subjected to low +G forces (less than + 3 G) for upwards of 30 minutes during reentry. A similar reentry profile is predicted for the National Aerospace Plane (NASP). The physiologic effects of this acceleration stress are compounded by the loss of body water experienced during microgravity. Currently, a standard 5 bladder <b>anti-G</b> <b>suit</b> is being used during shuttle reentry. There have been complaints of discomfort using this suit, mainly due to the abdominal bladder. This study compared the effectiveness of three <b>anti-G</b> <b>suit</b> configurations in volume depleted subjects during a simulated space shuttle reentry profile. Methods: Seven male subjects were given intravenous Lasix in a dose from 20 - 40 mg to induce a total body weight loss of 3 plus or minus 1. 5 percent. Approximately six hours after the injection, the subjects donned one of three anti-G suits - a standard 5 bladder <b>anti-G</b> <b>suit,</b> an extended coverage <b>anti-G</b> <b>suit</b> (the advanced technology <b>anti-G</b> <b>suit</b> or ATAGS), or an extended coverage <b>anti-G</b> <b>suit</b> without an abdominal bladder (the reentry <b>anti-G</b> <b>suit</b> or REAGS).

When systolic ELBP dropped below 70 mmHg, the <b>anti-G</b> <b>suit</b> was inflated in 0. 5 psig increments to the pressure required to maintain 70 mmHg ELBP. Each subject rode with all three suits. Comparisons were made between the final pressure required in each suit to maintain ELBP and subjective reports of comfort. Results: The mean final suit pressure required to maintain ELBP was 1. 1 psi, in both the ATAGS and REAGS versus 1. 8 psi in the standard suit. In addition, the subjects rated the REAGS suit highest on the comfort scale, citing the absence of the abdominal bladder as the main reason. Conclusions: Overall, the REAGS suit was the superior <b>anti-G</b> <b>suit</b> during long duration, low onset +G.

40|$|Abstract-Synchronized {{external}} pulsation {{is proposed}} {{as a method}} to improve tolerance to acceleration stress. This technique uses a modified <b>anti-G</b> <b>suit</b> which is pressurized and depressurized synchronously with the heart cycle. The feasibility of the procedure has been studied using a computer model of the cardiovascular system which includes the ef-fects of Gz stress, and contains simulations of baroreceptor control of heart rate and venous tone. Model predictions indicate that for unpro-tected subjects, carotid pressure at eye level (ophthalmic artery pres-sure) decreases to 20 mmHg (beginning of central light loss) at approxi-mately + 3. 6 Gz. Applying standard <b>anti-G</b> <b>suit</b> pressure to the model increases this level to 5. 3 Gz. When synchronized external pulsation of 2 psi is superimposed on the standard <b>anti-G</b> <b>suit</b> pressure, the tolerance to acceleration stress is further augmented by at least 0. 9 G above the protection afforded by the standard <b>anti-G</b> <b>suit</b> alone.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many {{cardiovascular}} changes {{associated with}} spaceflight reduce {{the ability of}} the cardiovascular system to oppose gravity on return to Earth, leaving astronauts susceptible to orthostatic hypotension during re-entry and landing. Consequently, an <b>anti-G</b> <b>suit</b> was developed to protect arterial pressure during re-entry. A liquid cooling garment (LCG) was then needed to alleviate the thermal stress resulting from use of the launch and entry suit. METHODS: We studied 34 astronauts on 22 flights (4 - 16 d). Subjects were studied 10 d before launch and on landing day. Preflight, crewmembers were suited with their anti-G suits set to the intended inflation for re-entry. Three consecutive measurements of heart rate and arterial pressure were obtained while seated and then again while standing. Three subjects who inflated the anti-G suits also donned the LCG for landing. Arterial pressure and heart rate were measured every 5 min during the de-orbit maneuver, through maximum G-loading (max-G) and touch down (TD). After TD, crew-members again initiated three seated measurements followed by three standing measurements. RESULTS: Astronauts with inflated anti-G suits had higher arterial pressure {{than those who did not}} have inflated anti-G suits during re-entry and landing (133. 1 +/- 2. 5 / 76. 1 +/- 2. 1 vs. 128. 3 +/- 4. 2 / 79. 3 +/- 2. 9, de-orbit; 157. 3 +/- 4. 5 / 102. 1 +/- 3. 6 vs. 145. 2 +/- 10. 5 / 95. 7 + 5. 5, max-G; 159. 6 +/- 3. 9 / 103. 7 +/- 3. 3 vs. 134. 1 +/- 5. 1 / 85. 7 +/- 3. 1, TD).

The REAGS was inflated to 1. 0 psig 10 minutes prior to G onset. The G-profile was identical to that used in the previous REAGS study. Physiologic parameters monitored were also the same, i. e., eye-level systolic blood pressure (ELBP) using the Finapres digital cuff technique and heart rate and rhythm. Subjective comments were obtained from questionnaires administered after the increased G exposure. Systolic ELBP was maintained at 60 mm Hg or above by pressurizing the <b>anti-G</b> <b>suit</b> in 0. 5 psig increments up to a maximum pressure of 2. 5 psig. There {{were no significant differences}} in mean G-suit pressure required to maintain systolic ELBP at 60 mm Hg or above between the REAGS worn with and without pressure socks. Maximum mean G-levels achieved during the GOR were also the same under both experimental conditions, i. e., 4. 7 G with socks and 4. 6 G without socks. These G-levels were essentially the same as recorded earlier with the unmodified REAGS. There {{were no significant differences in}} comfort rating during the G exposure assigned by subjects when they wore the modified REAGS with or without the pressure socks...|$|E
40|$|The {{physiological}} {{effects of}} space flights on humans are reviewed, {{and the opportunities}} offered by frequent and repetitive Space Shuttle flights for space medical research are discussed. The most significant changes encountered in the vestibular, cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and hematopoietic systems during and after past space missions are indicated, and the time courses of the physiological shifts associated with space acclimatization and readaptation to a 1 -g environment are summarized. Effects directly attributable {{to the absence of}} gravity, including postural changes and fluid shifts, are considered, and additional contributing factors to physiological changes imposed by the spacecraft operational environment are pointed out. Differences between the Space Shuttle missions and all previous missions in the areas of reentry profiles and varied crew composition are discussed, and results of experiments on the relative acceleration tolerances of men and women of different ages and the usefulness of the <b>anti-g</b> <b>suit</b> are presented. Directions for future research in space medicine available with the Shuttle are examined, with particular emphasis on the neurovestibular system cardiopulmonary dynamics, calcium metabolism, the erythropoietic system and the effects of space radiation...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnitude}} of physiologic changes which {{are known to}} occur in human subjects exposed to varying levels of + G sub Z acceleration following bed rest simulation of weightlessness was studied. Bed rest effects were documented by fluid and electrolyte balance studies, maximal exercise capability, 70 deg passive tilt and lower body negative pressure tests {{and the ability to}} endure randomly prescribed acceleration profiles of + 2 G sub Z, + 3 G sub Z, and + 4 G sub Z. Six healthy male volunteers were studied during two weeks of bed rest after adequate control observations, followed by two weeks of recovery, followed by a second two-week period of bed rest at which time an Air Force cutaway <b>anti-G</b> <b>suit</b> was used to determine its effectiveness as a countermeasure for observed cardiovascular changes during acceleration. Results showed uniform and significant changes in all measured parameters as a consequence of bed rest including a reduced ability to tolerate +G sub Z acceleration. The use of anti-G suits significantly improved subject tolerance to all G exposures and returned measured parameters such as heart rate and blood pressure towards or to pre-bed-rest (control) values in four of the six cases...|$|E
40|$|Long-term stay in {{weightlessness}} {{is accompanied}} by alterations in the activity of main physiological body systems including sensory-motor, skeletal-muscular disturbances and cardiovascular deconditioning. However, up to now, there are no data on the state and level of functional performance of cosmonauts/astronauts directly after flight, nor are there data to help define the dynamic recovery of functional characteristics and work efficiency which are greatly needed to provide the safety and planning of their activity once they reach space objects. The Russian and American scientists are currently engaged in a joint experiment known as the "Field Test" {{with the goal of}} studying the functional performance and the state of main physiological body systems directly after landing and their temporal recovery dynamics. The functional performance is identified during the test by temporal characteristics of the movements of spatial translation, the stability of the vertical stance for 3. 5 min, and the kinematic characteristics of walking - non-complicated and complicated. The following characteristics are identified as physiological characteristics of the test: a) orthostatic tolerance during stand test, b) back muscle tone; c) vertical stability - by characteristics of the correction responses to unexpected perturbations of the vertical stance, and d) support reactions during the performance of the full battery of tests. To date, a pilot version of the "Field Test" has been conducted with participation from four Russian cosmonauts. The results of studies have shown that in 1 - 5 hours after landing the functional abilities of the cosmonauts are considerably reduced. All the test movements at this time are considerably slower than preflight and the more complicated the task is, the greater significant reduction in orthostatic tolerance: during the first test that occurs 1 - 5 hours after landing. two of four cosmonauts declined to continue the task after the orthostatic test (one of them did not wear the <b>anti-G</b> <b>suit</b> "Centaurus" during testing). Blood pressure during moving out of prone posture to vertical stance in one of the cosmonauts and of sitting to standing position in the other dropped to the precollapse level. The results of the studies have confirmed the feasibility, the usefulness and the safety of conducting tests {{as close as possible to}} the landing. The program of "Field Test" experiment will be continued and extended...|$|E
40|$|The lung is {{extremely}} susceptible to gravity, even during short-term {{changes of the}} gravity vector, {{because it is a}} mixture of air and elastic tissue components. Yet, there is limited knowledge of the effects of gravity on the respiratory system. This is an important issue, for two reasons: 1) for understanding the physiology of space flight; and 2) because a better knowledge of these effects could help to understand the pulmonary changes that occur in a patient confined to bed, which is a partial simulation of a weightlessness (microgravity, 0 G) state. The present thesis aims to understand the influence of moderately increased gravity (1. 7 - 2 G), and of 0 G or simulated 0 G, on some pulmonary features, on a large (the whole lung) or small scale. In a first study, six subjects were studied before, during, and after 120 days of bed rest. Forced expiratory flows and volumes, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were recorded. Peak flow did not change, whereas mid-maximal expiratory flow decreased in the supine posture by ~ 22 %. DLCO also decreased during bed rest, by 14 %. These decreases had not recovered two weeks after bed rest. Such results speak against major muscle deconditioning caused by bed rest but are in favour of a decrease in lung elastic recoil and an alteration in gas exchange. These alterations are unlikely to influence daily life after bed rest but may limit maximal work capacity. In two further experimental studies, an <b>anti-G</b> <b>suit</b> was used to manipulate stroke volume (SV) and central blood volume (CBV). Nine and twelve subjects were studied at 1 G and at 2 G in a human centrifuge. It was found that SV and CBV, which change with gravity, play major roles in cardiopulmonary interactions: they influence mechanically the emptying of lung alveoli. Moreover, when SV and CBV increase, the indices of perfusion heterogeneity decrease. In a last study, twelve and six subjects were studied in different combinations of 1. 7 G and 0 G during two series of parabolic flights. Indices of small and large-scale pulmonary perfusion heterogeneity were measured. All decreased but still existed at 0 G, compared to 1 G and to 1. 7 G. This confirms previous reports of a large degree of gravity-independent heterogeneity of pulmonary perfusion. In conclusion, gravity in the head-to-foot direction is useful for maintaining a normal lung capacity. In contrast, the heterogeneity of pulmonary perfusion distribution is only partially influenced by gravity. Cardiopulmonary interactions on a small scale are not mainly influenced by gravity but rather by changes in intra-thoracic blood content during the cardiac cycle...|$|E
