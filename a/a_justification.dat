40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{maintains that}} <b>a</b> priori <b>justification</b> requires <b>a</b> non-experiential source of justification. Further, {{it is argued}} that a non-experiential source of justification involves only cognitive seemings as evidence to justify a belief. ^ Chapter one considers the question, in what sense is <b>a</b> priori <b>justification</b> independent of experience? Three theses are considered, each expresses a sense of independence allegedly necessary for a priori justification: source independence, defeasibility independence, and causal independence. I argue that defeasibility independence is not a necessary condition for <b>a</b> priori <b>justification.</b> I argue that source independence is a necessary condition for <b>a</b> priori <b>justification.</b> <b>A</b> priori <b>justification</b> must have <b>a</b> non-experiential source. Finally, I suggest that the issue of causal independence be deferred until the notion of a non-experiential source of justification has been clarified. ^ Chapter 2 deals with several recent accounts of the nature of non-experiential sources of justification. The views of Philip Kitcher, John Pollock, and Laurence BonJour are presented and evaluated in an attempt clarify the notion of a non-experiential source of justification. ^ Chapter three concerns the task of adequately distinguishing between experiential and non-experiential sources of epistemic justification. An argument against such a distinction is considered and rejected. Several proposals for distinguishing non-experiential sources of justification are considered. I put forth and defend the view that experiential sources of justification require sensory seemings while non-experiential sources of justification require only cognitive seemings. In light of this proposal, I suggest that <b>a</b> priori <b>justification</b> is independent in the sense required for the causal independence requirement introduced in Chapter one. ^ Chapter four examines Laurence BonJour 2 ̆ 7 s recent claims that <b>a</b> priori <b>justification</b> is indispensable to reasoning and that only a rationalist epistemology successfully accounts for <b>a</b> priori <b>justification.</b> I argue that neither conclusion is adequately supported by BonJour 2 ̆ 7 s arguments. ^ Finally, a concluding section summarizes the dissertation. ...|$|R

5|$|He {{was tried}} and convicted of Sharp's murder on May 19, 1826. His sentence– {{execution}} by hanging– {{was to be}} carried out on June 16, 1826.

The request was granted, allowing Beauchamp to complete his book, The Confession of Jereboam O. Beauchamp: who was hanged at Frankfort, Ky., on the 7th day of July, 1826, for the murder of Col. Solomon P. Sharp. After two failed suicide attempts with his wife, who {{died as a result of}} the second incident, Beauchamp was hanged for his crime on July 7, 1826.

5|$|The {{expedition}} quickly {{descended into}} a debacle.

It is also possible, however, that this story was spread by Aristagoras after the event, by way of <b>a</b> <b>justification</b> for the subsequent failure of the campaign. At any rate, the Naxians were able to prepare properly for a siege, and the Persians arrived to a well-defended expedition. The Persians laid siege to the Naxians for four months, but eventually they and Aristagoras both ran out of money. The force sailed back to the mainland without a victory.|$|E
40|$|The lottery paradox {{occurs when}} we combine two {{plausible}} claims about epistemic justification: Probability claim: If A’s evidence makes p exceedingly likely, then <b>A</b> has <b>justification</b> for believing p.

It has been estimated that {{over the course of the}} campaign there were 26,111 Australian casualties with 8,141 killed.

5|$|An {{investigation}} soon revealed Beauchamp as the killer, {{and he was}} apprehended at {{his home}} in Glasgow, four days after the murder. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death by hanging. He was granted a stay of execution to allow him to write <b>a</b> <b>justification</b> of his actions. Anna Cooke-Beauchamp was tried for complicity in the murder, but was acquitted for lack of evidence. Her devotion to Beauchamp prompted her to stay in his cell with him, where the two attempted a double suicide by drinking laudanum shortly before the execution. This attempt failed. On the morning of the execution, the couple again attempted suicide, this time by stabbing themselves with a knife Anna had smuggled into the cell. When the guards discovered them, Beauchamp was rushed to the gallows, where he was hanged before he could die of his stab wound. He was the first person legally executed in the state of Kentucky. Anna Cooke-Beauchamp died from her wounds shortly before her husband was hanged. In accordance with their wishes, the couple's bodies were positioned in an embrace when buried in the same coffin.|$|E
5|$|In July 1991, Špegelj and Đodan's demands were {{backed up}} {{by a number of}} Croatian Parliament members during a {{parliamentary}} debate. This led Tuđman to dismiss Đodan the same month he was appointed Defence Minister, and Špegelj resigned his post on 3 August. The deteriorating situation in eastern Croatia including JNA forces' removal of the ZNG from Baranja, intermittent fighting around Osijek, Vukovar and Vinkovci increasing losses and the growing conviction that the JNA actively supported the Croatian Serb revoltforced Tuđman to act. On 22 August, he issued an ultimatum to the federal Yugoslav authorities demanding the withdrawal of the JNA to its barracks {{by the end of the}} month. The ultimatum stated if the JNA failed to comply, Croatia would consider it an army of occupation and take corresponding action. On 1 September, the EC proposed a ceasefire and a peace conference was accepted by Tuđmandespite his ultimatumand by the Yugoslav Presidency. The conference started on 7 September, but only four days later, the Croatian member and chair of the presidency Stjepan Mesić ordered the JNA to return to its barracks within 48 hours. The move was motivated by Tuđman's impression that the conference would continue while the ZNG lost ground. Even though the order was disputed by other members of the body, it gave Croatia <b>a</b> <b>justification</b> to openly confront the JNA.|$|E

5|$|The first {{recorded}} works of Shakespeare are Richard III {{and the three}} parts of Henry VI, written in the early 1590s during a vogue for historical drama. Shakespeare's plays are difficult to date precisely, however, and studies of the texts suggest that Titus Andronicus, The Comedy of Errors, The Taming of the Shrew, and The Two Gentlemen of Verona may also belong to Shakespeare's earliest period. His first histories, which draw heavily on the 1587 edition of Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland, dramatise the destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been interpreted as <b>a</b> <b>justification</b> for {{the origins of the}} Tudor dynasty. The early plays were influenced by the works of other Elizabethan dramatists, especially Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe, by the traditions of medieval drama, and by the plays of Seneca. The Comedy of Errors was also based on classical models, but no source for The Taming of the Shrew has been found, though it is related to a separate play of the same name and may have derived from a folk story. Like The Two Gentlemen of Verona, in which two friends appear to approve of rape, the Shrew's story of the taming of a woman's independent spirit by a man sometimes troubles modern critics and directors.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} towards Christianity {{began again}} in the late 6th and 7th centuries, helped by {{the conversion of the}} Franks in Northern France, who carried considerable influence in England. Pope Gregory I sent a team of missionaries to convert King Æthelberht of Kent and his household, starting the process of converting Kent. Augustine became the first Archbishop of Canterbury and started to build new churches across the South-East, reusing existing pagan shrines. Oswald and Oswiu, kings of Northumbria, were converted in the 630s and 640s, and the wave of change carried on through the middle of the 7th century across the kingdoms of Mercia, the South Saxons and the Isle of Wight. The process was largely complete {{by the end of the}} 7th century, but left a confusing and disparate array of local practices and religious ceremonies. This new Christianity reflected the existing military culture of the Anglo-Saxons: as kings began to convert in the 6th and 7th centuries, conversion began to be used as <b>a</b> <b>justification</b> for war against the remaining pagan kingdoms, for example, while Christian saints were imbued with martial properties.|$|E
