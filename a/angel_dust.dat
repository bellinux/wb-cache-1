5|$|A mysterious {{recruiter}} approaches Wilson, {{offering an}} experimental cure for his cancer. He {{is taken to}} Ajax and <b>Angel</b> <b>Dust,</b> who inject him with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes. They then subject him to days of torture to induce stress to trigger any mutation Wade may have, but without success. Wilson discovers Ajax's real name, Francis, and mocks him for it. In response, Ajax leaves Wilson in a hyperbaric chamber that takes him to the verge of asphyxiation periodically over a weekend. It finally activates a superhuman healing ability that cures his cancer, but leaves him severely disfigured with burn-like scars over his entire body. He escapes from the chamber and attacks Ajax, but relents when told that his disfigurement can be cured. Ajax subdues Wilson and leaves him for dead in the burning laboratory.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Angel</b> <b>dusting</b> is the {{misleading}} {{marketing practice}} of including a minuscule amount {{of an active}} ingredient in a cosmetic, cosmeceutical, dietary supplement, food product, or nutraceutical, insufficient to give any measurable benefit.The advertising materials may claim that the ingredient is helpful and that the ingredient is contained in the product, {{both of which are}} true.

5000|$|<b>Angel</b> <b>dusting</b> is {{a process}} where an {{ingredient}} which would be beneficial, in a reasonable quantity, is instead added in an insignificant quantity which will have no consumer benefit, {{so they can make}} the claim that it contains that ingredient, and mislead the consumer into expecting that they will gain the benefit. For example, a cereal may claim it contains [...] "12 essential vitamins and minerals," [...] but the amounts of each may be only 1% or less of the Reference Daily Intake, providing virtually no benefit to nutrition.|$|R

500|$|Faith No More, a San Francisco-based band, have {{recorded}} approximately 100 songs {{over the course}} of their career; this includes material from six studio albums, one live album, and numerous B-side tracks and out-takes. Faith No More were founded in 1981 as Sharp Young Men, and changed their name to Faith No Man before releasing the 1982 double A-side single [...] "Quiet in Heaven" [...] / [...] "Song of Liberty". Upon assuming the name Faith No More, the band's first two full-length albums, We Care a Lot and Introduce Yourself, were driven mostly by new vocalist Chuck Mosley and the [...] "metallic guitar" [...] of Jim Martin, blending elements of rap and heavy metal music. Mosley was later replaced by Mr. Bungle vocalist Mike Patton, who added lyrics to the already-written music for 1989's The Real Thing. Their next studio album, <b>Angel</b> <b>Dust,</b> moved away from the band's rap-influenced sound to experiment with different musical genres; a trend which became much more pronounced on the 1995 album King for a Day...

She was chosen from the list of comic characters available to be used by Fox, based on her name. The characters Garrison Kane, Wyre, and Sluggo were included in the script at one point, but ultimately removed for budgetary reasons, while Cannonball and Tar Baby were also considered.

2500|$|Following {{the success}} of their {{previous}} album, The Real Thing and its subsequent tour, Faith No More took a break {{for a year and a}} half before beginning work on the follow-up, <b>Angel</b> <b>Dust.</b> During this time Mike Patton rejoined his high-school band Mr. Bungle to record their eponymous début album. This situation had an effect on the band, since drummer Mike Bordin thought the writing process was like the state of a [...] "magic slate" [...] having been [...] "completely covered in writing; there was not any more room for any more writing on that slate, so we all went and said all right, and erased everything, and started writing new stuff," [...] and Patton was creatively revitalized.
