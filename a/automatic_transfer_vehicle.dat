50|$|For all ESA {{selected}} astronauts, Basic Training {{begins at}} the EAC headquarters. This section of the training cycle has four separate training blocks that last 16 months. Astronauts will receive an orientation on the major spacefaring nations, their space agencies, and all major manned and unmanned space programs. Training in this phase also looks into applicable laws and policies of the space sector. Technical (including engineering, astrodynamics, propulsion, orbital mechanics, etc.) and scientific (including human physiology, biology, earth observation, and astronomy) basics are introduced, {{to ensure that all}} new astronauts have the required base level of knowledge. Training is done on ISS operations and facilities, including an introduction to all major operating systems on board the ISS that are required for its functionality as a manned space research laboratory. This phase also covers in-depth systems operations for all spacecraft that service the ISS (e.g. Soyuz, Progress, <b>Automatic</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (ATV), and the H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV)), as well as ground control and launch facility training. This training phase also focuses on skills such as robotic operations, rendezvous and docking, Russian language courses, human behavior and performance, and finally a PADI open water scuba diving course. This scuba course provides basic EVA training at ESA's NBF before moving onto the larger NASA training facility at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center.|$|E
40|$|The {{proposed}} paper {{deals with}} an automatic trajectory monitoring system designed for the rendezvous between the <b>automatic</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>vehicle</b> (ATV) and the Iautononternational Space Station (ISS). During final approach phase, a TV camera on the ISS currently provides images of ATV visual targets {{to be used by}} ISS crew for visual monitoring. The proposed monitoring system, based on a dedicated image-processing algorithm applied to these TV images of the approach, is intended to autonomously and automatically determine relative ATV-ISS position and attitude. Artificial intelligence techniques for edge detection, Hough transform and pattern matching are used to implement a recognition algorithm, able to fast and accurately indicate ATV visual targets position and orientation with respect to ISS. Those values are then processed in order to calculate the full set of relative ATV navigation data. Finally, an estimation of the relative trajectory evolution via a classical astrodynamic tool as the Euler-Hill relative motion equations follows, enabling the crew and the control centre to verify that trajectory corridors and attitude constraints are respected. According to ATV mission constraints, which require using existing sensors (i. e. ATV visual cues and ISS TV camera), the performances and the accuracy of the monitoring system are evaluated for significant approach cases. Overall, computation time and hardware requirements of the proposed system easily fall into the limits foreseen for a real-time on-board application. Both the ATV Control Centre (real-time GNC data check against telemetry) and the ISS (automatic monitoring tool for ISS crew) could take advantages of the output data provided by this system. Moreover, obtained results clearly show that the monitoring system is a suitable candidate for further developments and improvements aimed to provide a complete support tool for ATV mission operations during final approach phase...|$|E

40|$|There {{are three}} primary {{objectives}} of this study. The {{first is to}} identify time-phased accommodation capabilities necessary to support the civil space exploration initiatives. These initiatives include the Lunar and Mars missions in the Human Exploration Initiative (HEI). Primary accommodation requirements include integration and assembly of vehicle components and systems on-orbit, and protection of these vehicles from the space environment, particularly debris. Secondly, this study will develop accommodation concepts, define impacts (hooks and scars) to Space Station Freedom (SSF), identify staging/servicing requirements, and identify required technology advances. Finally, {{the majority of the}} study effort has been devoted to conducting a trade study to evaluate alternative <b>transfer</b> <b>vehicle</b> accommodation concepts. These concepts have ranged from basing all <b>transfer</b> <b>vehicle</b> accommodations for both Lunar and Mars <b>transfer</b> <b>vehicles</b> at SSF, to basing all accommodation capabilities off SSF.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{parametric design}} studies of electric propulsion lunar <b>transfer</b> <b>vehicles.</b> In designing a lunar <b>transfer</b> <b>vehicle,</b> selecting the 'best' operating {{points for the}} design parameters allows significant reductions in the mass in low earth orbit (LEO) for the mission. These parameters include the specific impulse, the power level, and the propulsion technology. Many of the decisions regarding the operating points are controlled by the propulsion and power system technologies that are available for the spacecraft. The relationship between these technologies is discussed and analyzed here. It is found that both ion and MPD propulsion offer significant LEO mass reductions over O 2 /H 2 for lunar <b>transfer</b> <b>vehicle</b> missions. The recommended operating points for the lunar <b>transfer</b> <b>vehicle</b> are an I(sp) of 5000 lb(f) -s/lb(m) and a 1 MW power level.

The flash geometry is very important in hot forging process because the flash geometry effects on the metal flow, material losses, forging load, die pressure and so on. In this study, the problem of designing the flash geometry is studied with flash thickness and width considering the maximum die pressure to apply an <b>automatic</b> <b>transfer</b> system in hot forging process for bearing hub. The numerical analysis was conducted by means of the commercial S/W DEFORM. On the basis of numerical analysis the flash geometry of hot forging die was redesigned, and experiment was conducted.

50|$|A standby {{generator}} is a back-up {{electrical system}} that operates automatically. Within seconds of a utility outage an <b>automatic</b> <b>transfer</b> switch senses the power loss, commands the generator {{to start and}} then transfers the electrical load to the generator. The standby generator begins supplying power to the circuits. After utility power returns, the <b>automatic</b> <b>transfer</b> switch transfers the electrical load back to the utility and signals the standby generator to shut off. It then returns to standby mode where it awaits the next outage. To ensure a proper response to an outage, a standby generator runs weekly self-tests. Most units run on diesel, natural gas or liquid propane gas.|$|R
