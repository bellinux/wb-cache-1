40|$|BACKGROUND: Payers {{and policy}} makers rely on studies of trends in acute {{myocardial}} infarction (AMI) hospitalizations and spending that count only hospitalizations where the AMI is the principal discharge diagnosis. Hospitalizations with <b>AMI</b> <b>coded</b> as a secondary diagnosis are ignored. The effects of excluding these hospitalizations on estimates of trends are unknown. METHODS: Observational study of all AMI hospitalizations in Fee-for-Service Medicare beneficiaries 65 years and older, from 2002 through 2011. RESULTS: We studied 3, 663, 137 hospitalizations with any AMI discharge diagnosis over 288, 873, 509 beneficiary-years. Of these, 66 % had <b>AMI</b> <b>coded</b> as principal (versus secondary). From 2002 to 2011, AMI hospitalization rates declined 24. 5 % (from 1, 485 per 100, 000 beneficiary-years in 2002 to 1, 122 in 2011). Meanwhile, the proportion of these hospitalizations with a secondary AMI diagnosis increased from 28 % to 40 %; by 2011 these secondary AMI hospitalizations accounted for 43 % of all expenditures for hospitalizations with AMI, or $ 2. 8 billion. Major changes in comorbidities, principal diagnoses and mean costs for hospitalizations with a non-principal AMI diagnosis occurred in the 2006 - 2008 timeframe. CONCLUSIONS: Current estimates {{of the burden of}} AMI ignore an increasingly large proportion of overall AMI hospitalizations and spending. Changes in the characteristics of hospitalizations that coincided with major payment and policy changes suggest that non-clinical factors affect <b>AMI</b> <b>coding.</b> Failing to consider all AMIs could inflate estimates of population health improvements, overestimate the value of AMI prevention and treatment and underestimate current and future AMI burden and expenditures...|$|R

We aimed to assess the long-term control of conventional cardiovascular risk factors after a STEMI among patients included in the <b>AMI</b> <b>code</b> registry. Design and methods: Four hundred and fifty-four patients were prospectively included between June- 2009 and April- 2013. Clinical characteristics were collected at baseline. The long-term control of cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular morbidity/mortality was assessed among the 6 -months survivors. Results: A total of 423 patients overcame the first 6 months after the STEMI episode, of whom 370 (87 %) underwent reperfusion therapy (363, 98 % of them, with primary angioplasty). At 1 -year follow-up, only 263 (62 %) had adequate blood pressure control, 123 (29 %) had LDL-cholesterol within targeted levels, 126 / 210 (60 %) smokers had withdrawn from their habit and 40 / 112 (36 %) diabetic patients had adequate glycosylated hemoglobin levels. During a median follow-up of 20 (11 – 30) months, cumulative mortality of 6 month-survivors was 6. 1 %, with 9. 9 % of hospital cardiovascular readmissions. The lack of assessment of LDL and HDL-cholesterol {{were significantly associated with}} higher mortality and cardiovascular readmission rates. Conclusions: Whereas implementation of the <b>AMI</b> <b>code</b> resulted in a widespread access to rapid reperfusion therapy, its long-term therapeutic benefit may be partially counterbalanced by a manifestly suboptimal control of cardiovascular risk factors. Further efforts should be devoted to secondary prevention strategies after STEMI.

Methods: We analyzed hospitalization records maintained at the national level by the Italian Ministry of Health for the diagnosis of hip fractures (ICD- 9 -CM codes 820 - 821), <b>AMI</b> (<b>code</b> 410), hemorrhagic (codes 430, 431, 432) and ischemic strokes (codes 433 - 434), and TIA (code 435) between 2001 - 2005. Cost analyses were based on diagnosis-related groups. Results: The incidence of hip fractures in elderly people has increased (+ 12. 9 % between 2001 and 2005), {{as well as that of}} AMI (+ 20. 2 %) and strokes (hemorrhagic: + 9. 6 %; ischemic: + 14. 7) occurring in the whole adult population; conversely, hospitalization due to TIA decreased by a rate of 13. 6 % between 2001 and 2005. In 2005, the hospital costs across the national health care system that were associated with hip fragility fractures in the elderly were comparable to those of strokes (both hemorrhagic and ischemic), which occurred in the whole Italian adult population. Moreover, these costs were higher than those generated by AMI and TIA. Rehabilitation costs following strokes reached about 3 billion Euros in 2005, but rehabilitative costs of hip fractures and AMI were comparable (about 530 million Euros in 2005).

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among patients discharged from three Swiss university hospitals with a primary or secondary International Classification of Diseases, 10 th revision (ICD- 10) <b>AMI</b> <b>code</b> in 1999. A total of 1, 129 patients' records were abstructed. Demographic characteristics and risk factors at admission were recorded. The main ECG and laboratory findings were further abstracted as well as hospital and discharge management and treatment. The main outcome measure was process quality indicators derived from evidence-based guidelines, and hospital mortality and early readmissions. FINDINGS: After exclusions, 577 patients with AMI were eligible for this study. The mean (SD) age was 68. 2 (13. 9). In the assessment of quality indicators patients with potential contra-indications were excluded. Among cohorts of "ideal candidates" for specific interventions, aspirin was not prescribed within 24 hours after admission in 33 (6. 2 percent) patients. Among those, 17 (51. 5 percent) died (p< 0. 0001). The adjusted OR for no aspirin after admission was 3. 61 (95 percent CI 1. 11 - 11. 77) for hospital mortality. Further, 78 (19. 5 percent) patients did not receive ß-blockers at discharge. Among them nine (11. 5 percent) were readmitted (p= 0. 133). The adjusted OR for no ß-blockers at discharge was 2. 15 (95 percent CI 0. 86 - 5. 41) for readmissions. Among patients with AMI, not prescribing aspirin within 24 hours after admission was associated with hospital mortality. However, process indicators derived from evidence-based guidelines were not related to early readmission in this study.

Several studies have found elderly patients with AMI have atypical presentations for diagnosis, therefore we undertook this study to determine the risks among the elderly population, especially in female patients. Materials and Methods: In this one-year retrospective study, we reviewed the cases of AMI patients who had visited the emergency department at Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taiwan, and who had either been discharged or had died following a diagnosis of <b>AMI</b> (ICD <b>code</b> 410).

The aim of this study was to examine the determinants of inter-hospital variability on 30 -day in-hospital mortality after AMI in Tuscany. This indicator is a proxy of 30 -day mortality that includes only deaths occurred during the index or subsequent hospitalizations. Methods: The study population was identified from hospital discharge records (HDRs) and included all patients with primary or secondary ICD- 9 -CM <b>codes</b> of <b>AMI</b> (ICD- 9 <b>codes</b> 410. xx) that were discharged between January 1, 2009 and November 30, 2009 from any hospital in Tuscany. The outcome of interest was 30 -day all-cause in-hospital mortality, defined as a death occurring for any reason in the hospital within 30 days of the admission date. Because of the hierarchical structure of the data, with patients clustered into hospitals, random-effects (multilevel) logistic regression models were used. The models included patient risk factors and random intercepts for each hospital. Results: The study included 5, 832 patients, 61. 90...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} positive {{predictive value}} (PPV) of different disease codes and free text in identifying acute myocardial infarction (AMI) from electronic healthcare records (EHRs). Design: Validation study of cases of AMI identified from general practitioner records and hospital discharge diagnoses using free text and codes from the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC), International Classification of Diseases 9 th revision-clinical modification (ICD 9 -CM) and ICD- 10 th revision (ICD- 10). Setting: Population-based databases comprising routinely collected data from primary care in Italy and the Netherlands and from secondary care in Denmark from 1996 to 2009. Participants: A total of 4 034 232 individuals with 22 428 883 person-years of follow-up contributed to the data, from which 42 774 potential AMI cases were identified. A random sample of 800 cases was subsequently obtained for validation. Main outcome measures: PPVs were calculated overall and for each code/free text. 'Best-case scenario' and 'worst-case scenario' PPVs were calculated, the latter taking into account non-retrievable/non-assessable cases. We further assessed the effects of AMI misclassification on estimates of risk during drug exposure. Results: Records of 748 cases (93. 5 % of sample) were retrieved. ICD- 10 codes had a 'best-case scenario' PPV of 100 % while ICD 9 -CM codes had a PPV of 96. 6 % (95 % CI 93. 2 % to 99. 9 %). ICPC codes had a 'best-case scenario' PPV of 75 % (95 % CI 67. 4 % to 82. 6 %) and free text had PPV ranging from 20 % to 60 %. Corresponding PPVs in the 'worst-case scenario' all decreased. Use of codes with lower PPV generally resulted in small changes in AMI risk during drug exposure, but codes with higher PPV resulted in attenuation of risk for positive associations. Conclusions: ICD 9 -CM and ICD- 10 codes have good PPV in identifying AMI from EHRs; strategies are necessary to further optimise utility of ICPC codes and free-text search. Use of specific <b>AMI</b> disease <b>codes</b> in estimation of risk during drug exposure may lead to small but significant changes and {{at the expense of}} decreased precision...|$|R
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{validate}} the Belgian vital statistics for {{coronary heart disease}} (CHD) {{on the basis of}} an independent acute myocardial infarction (AMI) register, carried out as part of the WHO-MONICA project. DESIGN: Records of fatal cases of AMI in the WHO-MONICA register were individually linked to the corresponding death certificates. SETTING: Since 1983, the WHO-MONICA Collaborating Centre Ghent/Charleroi registers all fatal and non-fatal AMI in the age group 25 - 69 years in two geographical areas, Ghent in the northern Dutch speaking part and Charleroi in the southern French speaking part of Belgium. Registration is done according to the MONICA protocol. The official vital statistics in Belgium are published on a yearly basis. They are essentially a reflection of the "underlying" causes of death, coded according to the 9 th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The study was undertaken in the period 1983 - 1991. MAIN RESULTS: Out of a total of 741 (Ghent) and 934 (Charleroi) well documented MONICA fatal cases of AMI, 492 (66. 4 %) and 641 (68. 6 %), respectively, were officially labelled as CHD (ICD code 410 - 414); 438 (59. 1 %) and 385 (41. 2 %), respectively, were officially labelled as <b>AMI</b> (ICD <b>code</b> 410). A substantial fraction of the MONICA AMI cases [...] 27. 1 % in Ghent and 38. 2 % in Charleroi [...] was coded as "other forms of CHD" (ICD 411 - 414) or as "other forms of heart disease" (ICD 420 - 429). The remaining MONICA AMI cases [...] 13. 8 % in Ghent and 20. 6 % in Charleroi [...] were classified in either very aspecific (for example, atherosclerosis, ICD 440) or totally unrelated ICD codes (for example, neoplasm, ICD 140 - 239). CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded from the results in this paper that a substantial part of all deaths caused by CHD in Belgium are labelled with incorrect ICD codes and are therefore misclassified in the official mortality statistics for Belgium. This is partly caused by a "drainage" of cases towards less specific CHD related ICD categories. A considerable fraction, however, seems to be absolutely misclassified...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Mortality from {{cardiovascular}} disease in Estonia {{is among the}} highest in Europe. The reasons for this have not been clearly explained. Also, there are no studies available examining outpatient drug utilization patterns in patients who suffered from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in Estonia. The objective {{of the present study was}} to examine drug utilization in different age and gender groups following AMI in Estonia. Methods Patients admitted to hospital with <b>AMI</b> (ICD <b>code</b> I 21 -I 22) during the period of 01. 01. 2004 - 31. 12. 2005 and who survived more than 30 days were followed 365 days from the index episode. Data about reimbursed prescriptions of beta-blockers (BBs), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACE/ARBs) and statins for these patients was obtained from the database of the Estonian Health Insurance Fund. Data were mainly analysed using frequency tables and, where appropriate, the Pearson's χ 2 test, the Mann-Whitney U-test and the t-test were used. A logistic regression method was used to investigate the relationship between drug allocation and age and gender. We presented drug utilization data as defined daily dosages (DDD) per life day in four age groups and described proportions of different combinations used in men and women. Results Four thousand nine hundred patients were hospitalized due to AMI and 3854 of them (78. 7 %) were treated by BBs, ACE/ARBs and/or statins. Of the 4025 inpatients who survived more than 30 days, 3799 (94. 4 %) were treated at least by the one of drug groups studied. Median daily dosages differed significantly between men and women in the age group 60 - 79 years for BBs and ACE/ARBs, respectively. Various combinations of the drugs studied were not allocated in equal proportions for men and women, although the same combinations were the most frequently used for both genders. The logistic regression analysis adjusted to gender and age revealed that some combinations of drugs were not allocated similarly in different age and gender groups. Conclusions Most of the patients were prescribed at least one of commonly recommended drugs. Only 40 % of them were treated by combinations of beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers and statins, which is inconsistent with guideline recommendations in Estonia. Standards of training and quality programs in Estonia should be reviewed and updated aiming to improve an adherence to guidelines of management of acute myocardial infarction in all age and gender groups. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background. In Denmark, as in {{many other}} Western countries, a decline in {{mortality}} from ischaemic heart disease (IHD) has been observed. The present study assesses whether the decline in IHD mortality is due to a decrease in incidence and/or case-fatality, and whether parallel changes occurred in the various manifestations of IHD requiring hospitalization. Methods. The National Patient Register of hospital discharges and the Causes-of-Death Register were linked and all cases of first admission for IHD including AMI and fatal first manifestation of IHD since 1977 in the entire Danish popu-lation were identified. Cases of AMI and IHD were considered as incident cases if no admission for these diagnoses had occurred during the preceding 5 years. Sex-specific, age-standardized annual mortality, incidence and case-fatality rates of <b>AMI</b> (ICD 8 <b>code</b> 410), narrowly defined IHD (NIHD, ICD 8 codes 410 - 4) and broadly defined IHD (BIHD, ICD 8 codes 410 - 4, 427 and 795 - 6) were calculated for the period 1982 - 1992. Results. During the entire period the age-standardized mortality of AMI, NIHD and BIHD decreased in both men and women. The incidence of AMI and NIHD decreased, while the incidence of BIHD remained constant. Case fatality of AMI decreased in both men and women, while case fatality of NIHD and BIHD decreased in men and in women aged 0 - 64 years only. Conclusion. The declining mortality from IHD in Denmark may be partly due to declining incidence as well as declining case fatality, but changes in disease manifestation or diagnostic drift may also contribute because more broadly define...|$|R
