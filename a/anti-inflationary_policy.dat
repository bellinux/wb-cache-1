50|$|Monetary policy {{during the}} Korean War, {{centered}} around {{the issue of whether}} or not the Federal Reserve should continue its prewar policy of setting a floor under the prices of government bonds or whether it should allow prices to drop, in order to restrict money and credit growth to restrict inflation. Truman and his Treasury Secretary, John W. Snyder strongly were in favor of the former strategy of pegging government bond prices, but the Federal Reserve saw the need to encourage macroeconomic stability, meaning fighting inflation. At the outbreak of the war, prices surged; by February 1951, the monthly increase in the consumer price index was almost 20 percent annually. Ultimately, the Federal Reserve followed an <b>anti-inflationary</b> <b>policy.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{impact of}} the Korean War on the Economy of the United States refers {{to the ways in}} which the American economy was {{affected}} by the Korean experience from 1950 to 1953. While the cost of the Korean War was less significant than that of World War II, it still changed the structure of the American growth as a result of its financing. The Korean War boosted GDP growth through government spending, which in turn constrained investment and consumption. While taxes were raised significantly to finance the war, the Federal Reserve followed an <b>anti-inflationary</b> <b>policy.</b> Though there was a large increase in prices at the outset of the war, price and wage controls ultimately stabilized prices by the end of the war. Consumption and investment continued to grow after the war, but below the trend rate prior to the war.|$|E
5000|$|The idea of {{hysteresis}} is {{used extensively}} {{in the area of}} labor economics, specifically with reference to the unemployment rate. According to theories based on hysteresis, severe economic downturns (recession) and/or persistent stagnation (slow demand growth, usually after a recession) cause unemployed individuals to lose their job skills (commonly developed on the job) or to find them become obsolete or become demotivated/disillusioned/depressed or lose job-seeking skills. In addition, employers may use time spent in unemployment as a screening tool, i.e., to weed out less desired employees in hiring decisions. Then, in times of an economic upturn, recovery, or 'boom', the affected workers will not share in the prosperity, remaining unemployed for long periods (e.g., over 52 weeks). This makes unemployment [...] "structural", i.e., extremely difficult to reduce simply by increasing the aggregate demand for products and labor without causing increased inflation. That is, it is possible that a ratchet effect in unemployment rates exists, so a short-term rise in unemployment rates tend to persist. For example, traditional <b>anti-inflationary</b> <b>policy</b> (the use of recession to fight inflation) leads to a permanently higher 'natural' rate of unemployment (more scientifically known as the NAIRU). This occurs first because inflationary expectations are 'sticky' downward due to wage and price rigidities (and so adapt slowly over time rather than being approximately correct as in theories of rational expectations) and second because labor markets do not clear instantly in response to unemployment.|$|E

40|$|Long-term {{unemployment}} in Poland {{in the years}} 1995 - 2007 This study analyses trends in the long-term {{unemployment in}} Poland, {{as well as its}} structure and macroeconomic importance for both equilibrium unemployment and the efficacy of <b>anti-inflationary</b> <b>policy.</b> It combines a theoretical part with discussion based on the statistics on the Polish economy for recent years.

The empirical analyses of the Polish economy indicate that the duration of unemployment is a factor that significantly shapes the probability of finding a job. The hypothesis that the rates of worker flows from the stock of unemployment to the stock of employment are much lower {{in the case of the}} long-term unemployed persons than for the short-term unemployed has been corroborated. The statistical data on the Polish economy show that the country’s long-term unemployment is relatively large.

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{dynamics}} of relative prices {{of goods and services}} in Georgia in the period of relative macroeconomic stabilization i. e., in years 1996 – 2001. Structure of Georgian consumer price index (CPI) is described in details and an analysis of the dynamics of relative prices is presented. It is shown that inflation is positively correlated with the variability of relative prices as measured by the standard deviation of the distribution of prices and also with the third moment (skewness) of the overall distribution of prices. Consequently, the efforts to minimize relative price variability should be considered an important part of <b>anti-inflationary</b> <b>policy</b> (the main recommendation for conducting <b>anti-inflationary</b> <b>policy</b> should include frequent increases of administratively regulated prices slightly in excess of overall inflation so that upward adjustments can take place without inducing large price variability). Moreover, based on the examination of basic 8 groups of goods and services and 56 subgroups included into basket used for CPI computation, it is shown that in the period under study the general price level increased mainly due to the increase in prices of goods with administrative regulated prices (except "alcoholic beverages"). In contrary, free market prices for food and beverages (except "fruits and vegetables") and other goods and services (except "personal care and effects") increased much less than the general price level in the country, i. e., relatively decreased. inflation, relative prices, Georgia...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} how {{the output}} or unemployment cost of achieving a sustainable {{reduction in the}} rate of inflation depends on the structure of the wage-price process and how the "sacrifice ratio" can be minimized. In models where the natural rate is invariant under the <b>anti-inflationary</b> <b>policies,</b> price level inertia is not sufficient for a positive sacrifice ratio. Without sluggishness in the core inflation rate, a zero sacrifice ratio can be achieved simply through intelligent demand management. With sluggish core inflation, the sacrifice ratio is positive unless intelligent demand management is complemented by cost-reducing fiscal measures o reffective incomes policy. Letting the exchange rate float does not reduce the sacrifice ratio. If core inflation is partly backward-looking and partly forward-looking, current core inflation may be a function of current and past expectations of future recessions. Conventional sacrifice ratio calculations ignore forward-looking aspects of behaviour and may therefore underestimate the true cost of disinflation. If there is hysteresis in the natural rate (e. g. through a gradual adjustment of the natural rate towards the actual rate) and if there is sluggish core inflation, the sacrifice ratio will become infinite. Whenever sluggish core inflation is present, credibility of the <b>anti-inflationary</b> (monetary) <b>policy</b> alone cannot obviate a positive sacrifice ratio. ...|$|R
