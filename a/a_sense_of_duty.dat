5|$|By 1916, Yeats was 51 {{years old}} and {{determined}} to marry and produce an heir. His rival John MacBride had been executed {{for his role in}} the 1916 Easter Rising, so Yeats hoped that his widow might remarry. His final proposal to Maud Gonne took place in mid-1916. Gonne's history of revolutionary political activism, as well as a series of personal catastrophes in the previous few years of her life—including chloroform addiction and her troubled marriage to MacBride—made her a potentially unsuitable wife and biographer R.F. Foster has observed that Yeats's last offer was motivated more by <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> than by a genuine desire to marry her.|$|E
5|$|Antisemitism {{was common}} in Germany and {{throughout}} Europe during this period, and Manstein's {{attitude towards the}} Jews had its roots in his exposure to and assimilation of these views. His actions were a reflection of his loyalty toward Hitler and the Nazi regime and of his grounding in <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> based on traditional Prussian military values. His criticism of Hitler was based solely on their disagreements over {{the conduct of the}} war, not about the regime's racial policies. Some historians, including Antony Beevor and Benoît Lemay, are of the opinion that Manstein had some Jewish ancestry. Manstein was the only Reichswehr officer who opposed the introduction of the Aryan paragraph in 1934. He sent a letter of protest to General Beck, commenting that anyone who had volunteered to serve in the armed forces had already proven their worth.|$|E
25|$|The Windsor Report was criticised by liberals (for example, in The Windsor Report: A Liberal Response) for {{seeming to}} take for granted that the actions of New Hampshire and New Westminster—and {{homosexuality}} in general—were wrong. For example, while it calls for both conservatives and liberals to apologise for disunity, it acknowledges that the conservatives may have acted out of <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty.</b> However, it concedes no such acknowledgement to New Westminster and New Hampshire.|$|E

25|$|No Quebec or francophone {{members of}} King's cabinet or {{government}} {{were willing to}} step into the role, but many recommended St. Laurent to take the post instead. On these recommendations, King recruited St. Laurent to his World War II cabinet as Minister of Justice, Lapointe's old post, on 9 December. St. Laurent agreed to go to Ottawa out of <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty,</b> but only on the understanding that his foray into politics was temporary and that he would return to Quebec {{at the conclusion of the}} war. In February 1942, he won a by-election for Quebec East, Lapointe's old riding.|$|E
25|$|Anne {{was barely}} {{a year old}} when her mother became ill of what is {{believed}} to have been uterine cancer. Maria Branwell died on 15 September 1821. In order to provide a mother for his children, Patrick tried to remarry, but without success. Maria's sister, Elizabeth Branwell (1776–1842), moved to the parsonage, initially to nurse her dying sister, but she spent the rest of her life there raising the children. She did it from <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty,</b> but she was a stern woman who expected respect, rather than love. There was little affection between her and the older children, but Anne, according to tradition, was her favourite.|$|E

25|$|Many {{sections}} of the country had reason to be dissatisfied with the existing autocracy. Nicholas II was a deeply conservative ruler and maintained a strict authoritarian system. Individuals and society in general were expected to show self-restraint, devotion to community, deference to the social hierarchy and <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> to the country. Religious faith helped bind all of these tenets together {{as a source of}} comfort and reassurance in the face of difficult conditions and as a means of political authority exercised through the clergy. Perhaps more than any other modern monarch, Nicholas II attached his fate and the future of his dynasty to the notion of the ruler as a saintly and infallible father to his people.|$|E
25|$|Isabella {{was born}} to John I of Portugal and Philippa of Lancaster, who had six {{children}} survive infancy. Born in 1397 in Évora, {{and raised in the}} Portuguese court in Lisbon, Isabella was the fourth child and only daughter to survive to adulthood. Phillippa instilled in all her children, including her daughter, <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty,</b> faith and belief in education. Isabella was an avid reader and held an interest in politics. Her father ensured that she was given a good understanding of politics, joining her brothers in their instructions in affairs of state and she became proficient in Latin, French, English and Italian during her studies with the princes. She was fond of riding and hunting with her brothers.|$|E
25|$|While Harrison's {{slaves were}} {{sustained}} {{by the success of}} the plantations, their treatment presented a picture consistent with the period. It is known that in the division of slaves among his children, Benjamin's father specifically prohibited any splitting of slave families. The Harrisons also assumed <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> to indoctrinate their slaves in Christianity. There were a number of mulattoes among the slaves Benjamin V inherited; while there is no specific information to show who fathered them, it was particularly common for younger plantation family members and guests, as well as overseers, to invade slave dwellings for carnal reasons. In this light, Benjamin IV's decision to ignore primogeniture subjected his younger children and their slaves to potentially precarious circumstances. There are no known specific instances of abuse by the Harrisons of their slaves, beyond the opprobrious conduct inherent in their claim to ownership of them.|$|E

The protests brought debates and discussions to our homes." [...] She also said that since the rape and protests the media is now providing coverage of sexual violence. However, she saw [...] "absolutely no change in the rape culture and related brutality. The streets are not safe. Teasing [...] and catcalling or worse are to be found everywhere. Sexual harassment in public places as well as inside the home is still rampant." [...] She added, [...] "I do acknowledge, however, that a year is too less to undo what patriarchy has done over centuries. It is too embedded in our homes, our institutions and in our laws.

500|$|On 15 September 1939 Menzies {{announced}} {{the formation of}} the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF). This expeditionary force initially consisted of 20,000men organised into an infantry division (the 6th Division) and auxiliary units. The AIF was institutionally separate from the CMF, which was legally restricted to service in Australia and its external territories, and was formed by raising new units rather than transferring CMF units. On 15 November, Menzies {{announced the}} reintroduction of conscription for home-defence service, effective 1 January 1940. Recruitment for the AIF was initially slow, but one in six men of military age had enlisted by March 1940 and a huge surge of volunteers came forward after the fall of France in June 1940. Men volunteered for the AIF for a range of reasons, with the most common being <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> to defend Australia and the British Empire. In early 1940 each of the services introduced regulations which prohibited the enlistment of people not [...] "substantially of European origin"; while these regulations were strictly enforced by the RAN and Army, the RAAF continued to accept small numbers of non-European Australians.|$|E

Tyrion's elder sister Cersei is the Queen of Westeros by virtue of her marriage to King Robert Baratheon, and Cersei's male twin Jaime {{is one of the}} Kingsguard, the royal bodyguard. Described as an ugly ("for all the world like a gargoyle"), malformed dwarf with different colored eyes, green and black, Tyrion possesses the golden blond hair of a Lannister but has a complicated relationship with the rest of them. While he is afforded the privilege and luxuries of his family, he is treated as a [...] "second class noble" [...] because of his stature. Tyrion's mother Joanna died giving birth to him and Tywin and Cersei loathe him because they blame him for her death. While Tywin bears no affection for Tyrion, he nevertheless feels <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> to his son, raising him in the Lannister fold and extending Tyrion a share of the family wealth. In contrast to Tywin and Cersei, Jaime has great affection for Tyrion and treats him with kindness, respect, friendship and love. Lev Grossman of Time wrote in 2011: ...|$|E
500|$|For Key's second visual novel Air, Maeda {{admitted}} {{he felt he}} was able to write what he wanted to for the game's scenario, but he later discovered that Air was difficult for players to receive and experience. Due to this, Maeda felt that for Key's next work Clannad, he had <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> to make the game easier to receive for as many users as possible. In any case, he wanted to make it an entertaining game, and started planning on Clannad almost immediately after Airs completion. From the start of Clannads planning, Maeda did not want to write a story like in Air, but instead wanted to focus on writing a deep connection between the 'people and the town', and 'humanity'. Maeda noted that he exceeded his writing ability when writing most of the scenarios in Clannad, and equates Clannads writing process as a [...] "wall that I {{will never be able to}} get over again." [...] While at the beginning Maeda felt he was prepared, the entire game's story started to increase to a level Maeda never predicted, and Suzumoto noted that it approximately doubled in size from the original projected length. Suzumoto attributed the increase due to the lengthening structure of the game's base scenario which caused the 'branch' scenarios to increase as well.|$|E

500|$|Willie Gillis was a freckle-faced All-American {{character}} {{who served as}} one of Rockwell's main coverboys during World War II. The Gillis character is widely referred to as an everyman who epitomized the typical American World War II soldier. [...] Rockwell created Gillis in 1940 as the European Theatre of World War II was escalating and Americans were enlisting or being drafted into the armed forces under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940. Rockwell credits the name Willie Gillis to his wife, who derived it from the old nursery rhyme Wee Willie Winkie. Rockwell described Gillis as [...] "an inoffensive, ordinary little guy thrown into the chaos of war." [...] The public identified with Rockwell's portrayal of the [...] "little guy" [...] living up to <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> {{in this time of}} war. [...] Gillis was truly seen as the typical G.I., and Rockwell's wartime art remains quite popular: his signed original May 29, 1943 depiction of Rosie the Riveter sold at a Sotheby's auction on May 22, 2002 for $4,959,500. Some of the Willie Gillis paintings and the Rosie the Riveter painting were raffled off during the United States Department of the Treasury's Second War Loan Drive, which ran from April 12 – May 1, 1943. [...] The Gillis character endures generations later for literary and artistic comparison.|$|E
500|$|Pascal and Maximus have {{garnered}} widespread universal acclaim from film critics, who greeted both {{characters with}} nearly equal praise but generally reviewed Maximus more enthusiastically.

[...] Kerry Lengel of The Arizona Republic enthused, [...] "In true Disney fashion, {{two of the}} most memorable characters are animals: Pascal ... and Maximus, a barrel-chested horse with the tracking skills of a bloodhound and <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> straight out of Gilbert and Sullivan." [...] The Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips wrote that both characters are [...] "Very funny, very noble" [...] and [...] "lovely supporting character."

[...] The Globe and Mails Jennie Punter hailed them as [...] "characters that only Disney animators could so memorably portray." [...] Writing for the Miami Herald, Rene Rodriguez described both characters as [...] "terrific," [...] while Alison Gang of U-T San Diego called them [...] "hilarious." [...] David Edelstein of Vulture.com admitted that he [...] "can't help liking a movie with chameleon reaction shots."

[...] Observing the way in which animal sidekicks have become [...] "Disney animation staples," [...] Doris Toumarkine of Film Journal International wrote that Pascal is [...] "cute-as-can-be," [...] likening the character to Jiminy Cricket from Disney's Pinocchio (1940). Matt Brunson of Creative Loafing wrote that Pascal [...] "is likely to charm the adults, further designating Tangled as silky-smooth entertainment."

[...] Describing the character as [...] "marvelously bothered," [...] Michelle Orange of Movieline wrote that Maximus is [...] "given a nuanced fidelity and expressive agility so precise that it seems more human than human." [...] Cynthia Fuchs of PopMatters called Maximus [...] "magnificent." [...] Empires Helen O'Hara wrote that Maximus is a [...] "comic scene-stealer and police horse extraordinaire." [...] While Ian Berriman of SFX dubbed Maximus the film's [...] "breakout star," [...] The Ages Jim Schembri hailed the character as [...] "the funniest horse in film history."
