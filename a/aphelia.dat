5|$|Currently, {{the furthest}} known objects, such as Comet West, have <b>aphelia</b> around 70,000 AU from the Sun, {{but as the}} Oort cloud becomes better known, this may change.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Camille Flammarion {{noted that}} the comets 1862 III and 1889 III had <b>aphelia</b> of 47 and 49AU, respectively, {{suggesting}} that they might mark the orbital radius of an unknown planet that had dragged them into an elliptical orbit. Astronomer George Forbes concluded {{on the basis of}} this evidence that two planets must exist beyond Neptune. He calculated, based on the fact that four comets possessed <b>aphelia</b> at around 100AU and a further six with <b>aphelia</b> clustered at around 300AU, the orbital elements of a pair of hypothetical trans-Neptunian planets. These elements concorded suggestively with those made independently by another astronomer named David Peck Todd, suggesting to many that they might be valid. However, sceptics argued that the orbits of the comets involved were still too uncertain to produce meaningful results. George Forbes is today considered to be the first describing Planet Nine.|$|E
5|$|Because their {{elliptical}} orbits frequently {{take them}} {{close to the}} giant planets, comets are subject to further gravitational perturbations. Short-period comets have a tendency for their <b>aphelia</b> to coincide with a giant planet's semi-major axis, with the JFCs being the largest group. It is clear that comets {{coming in from the}} Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the gravity of giant planets {{as a result of a}} close encounter. Jupiter is the source of the greatest perturbations, being more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. These perturbations can deflect long-period comets into shorter orbital periods.|$|E
50|$|Asaphodes <b>aphelias</b> is a moth of the Geometridae family. It is {{endemic to}} New Zealand. The type {{specimen}} {{of this species}} was collected from Hump Ridge in Fiordland by Alfred Philpott. A. <b>aphelias</b> was first described by Philpott under the name Xanthorhoe helias obscura.|$|R
5|$|Some {{scholars}} theorise {{that the}} galactic tide {{may have contributed}} to the formation of the Oort cloud by increasing the perihelia (smallest distances to the Sun) of planetesimals with large <b>aphelia</b> (largest distances to the Sun). The effects of the galactic tide are quite complex, and depend heavily on the behaviour of individual objects within a planetary system. Cumulatively, however, the effect can be quite significant: up to 90% of all comets originating from the Oort cloud may be the result of the galactic tide. Statistical models of the observed orbits of long-period comets argue that the galactic tide is the principal means by which their orbits are perturbed toward the inner Solar System.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} classes of comet: short-period comets (also called {{ecliptic}} comets) and long-period comets (also called nearly isotropic comets). Ecliptic comets have relatively small orbits, below 10AU, and follow the ecliptic plane, the same plane in which the planets lie. All long-period comets have very large orbits, {{on the order of}} thousands of AU, and appear from every direction in the sky. Oort noted that there was a peak in numbers of long-period comets with <b>aphelia</b> (their farthest distance from the Sun) of roughly 20,000AU, which suggested a reservoir at that distance with a spherical, isotropic distribution.|$|E
500|$|Periodic comets or short-period comets are {{generally}} {{defined as those}} having orbital periods of less than 200 years. They usually orbit more-or-less in the ecliptic plane {{in the same direction}} as the planets. Their orbits typically take them out to the region of the outer planets (Jupiter and beyond) at aphelion; for example, the aphelion of Halley's Comet is a little beyond the orbit of Neptune. Comets whose <b>aphelia</b> are near a major planet's orbit are called its [...] "family". Such families are thought to arise from the planet capturing formerly long-period comets into shorter orbits.|$|E
500|$|The {{scattered}} disc, which overlaps the Kuiper belt but extends {{much further}} outwards, {{is thought to}} be the source of short-period comets. Scattered-disc objects are thought to have been ejected into erratic orbits by the gravitational influence of Neptune's early outward migration. Most scattered disc objects (SDOs) have perihelia within the Kuiper belt but <b>aphelia</b> far beyond it (some more than 150AU from the Sun). SDOs' orbits are also highly inclined to the ecliptic plane and are often almost perpendicular to it. Some astronomers consider the scattered disc to be merely another region of the Kuiper belt and describe scattered disc objects as [...] "scattered Kuiper belt objects". Some astronomers also classify centaurs as inward-scattered Kuiper belt objects along with the outward-scattered residents of the scattered disc.|$|E
500|$|Long-period comets have highly {{eccentric}} orbits and periods {{ranging from}} 200 years {{to thousands of}} years. An eccentricity greater than 1 when near perihelion {{does not necessarily mean}} that a comet will leave the Solar System. For example, Comet McNaught had a heliocentric osculating eccentricity of 1.000019 near its perihelion passage epoch in January 2007 but is bound to the Sun with roughly a 92,600-year orbit because the eccentricity drops below 1 as it moves further from the Sun. The future orbit of a long-period comet is properly obtained when the osculating orbit is computed at an epoch after leaving the planetary region and is calculated with respect to the center of mass of the Solar System. By definition long-period comets remain gravitationally bound to the Sun; those comets that are ejected from the Solar System due to close passes by major planets are no longer properly considered as having [...] "periods". The orbits of long-period comets take them far beyond the outer planets at <b>aphelia,</b> and the plane of their orbits need not lie near the ecliptic. Long-period comets such as Comet West and C/1999 F1 can have aphelion distances of nearly 70,000 AU with orbital periods estimated around 6 million years.|$|E
