500|$|Author Ian Inglis {{notes the}} Isle of Wight {{performance}} {{as having been}} a [...] "hugely important and anxious occasion" [...] for Dylan and views Harrison's opening verse as a [...] "personal plea" [...] for him to [...] "pull out of his depression, to face the world again, and {{to look to the}} future".

500|$|Musically, {{the song}} {{is set in a}} slow, country-waltz time {{signature}} with, as Leng observes, melody and lyrics working [...] "in tandem". Within each couplet, a rising musical figure presents the [...] "problem" [...] ("Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> crying?"), while the second line consists of a [...] "falling melodic consolation" [...] ("Your pain is now through"). In his 1980 autobiography, Harrison offers little comment about [...] "Behind That Locked Door", aside from identifying the inspiration behind the song and admitting: [...] "It was a good excuse to do a country tune with pedal steel guitar." ...|$|E

[...] Wallace {{was at the top of}} their [...] "wish list" [...] of possible producers. The group recorded their debut album, Beautiful Hum (May 2008), over an eight-week span in late 2006 in Los Angeles and San Fernando Valley, working at The Pass and Sound City Studios.

2500|$|Tebbit, in an {{interview}} with the Los Angeles Times, said: [...] "A large proportion of Britain's Asian population fail to pass the cricket test. [...] Which side do they cheer for?

2500|$|On October 2, 2012, Rucker {{was invited}} to join the Grand Ole Opry. Halfway through his set at the Opry that night he {{answered}} questions from the audience which included a question from Brad Paisley. Paisley said: [...] "I have two questions. One, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> the worst poker player in the world? And two, would you like to become the newest member of the Grand Ole Opry?" [...] Rucker accepted, and it became official on October 16.|$|E
50|$|Yan What ever <b>you</b> will <b>be,</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> my Nian. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> my own Nian, that’s enough.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not believe}} that you meant evil to me, but <b>you</b> <b>were</b> indiscreet. Let that be {{sufficient}} now, and bear this in mind, Eleanor--you know the place you hold in my affections, but <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> nearer to me than <b>you</b> are; <b>were</b> <b>you</b> already my wife, and the mother of my children, I would not stand between you and the punishment you would deserve, if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> untrue to your country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} of your {{gratitude}} before," [...] he replied drily, [...] "and I think this can scarce <b>be</b> the matter <b>you</b> called me from my wine to listen to.

2500|$|Since I {{received}} the first accusation twenty-two years after Baby and Child Care was originally published--and since those who write about how harmful {{my book is}} invariably assure me they've never used it--I think it's clear that the hostility is to my politics rather than my pediatric advice. And though I've been denying the accusation for twenty-five years, {{one of the first}} questions I get from many reporters and interviewers is, [...] "Doctor Spock, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> permissive?" [...] You can't catch up with a false accusation.|$|E

Which side do they cheer for? It's an interesting test. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> harking back to where you came from or where you are?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{suspected}} where <b>you</b> <b>were</b> leading. <b>Still</b> <b>you</b> see, I'd sooner stay. For one thing, I hate {{leaving an}} awkward job half finished. You're {{beginning to feel}} the job <b>is</b> bigger than <b>you</b> thought it <b>was</b> when <b>you</b> undertook it?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Yu Fan once sailed {{along the}} river and {{encountered}} Mi Fang. The sailors on Mi Fang's boat wanted Yu Fan's boat to give way, so they shouted, [...] "Make way for the General's boat!" [...] Yu Fan replied angrily, [...] "How can you serve a lord when you've already abandoned the values of loyalty and righteousness? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> fit {{to be called a}} 'General' after you've lost two of your previous lord's strongholds?" [...] Mi Fang did not reply and he drew the curtains on his boat and instructed his men to give way.|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{trouble with}} <b>you,</b> Hugh, <b>is</b> that <b>you</b> <b>still</b> deceive yourself. <b>You</b> throw a glamour over things. You {{want to keep}} your {{cake and eat it}} too.|$|R
6000|$|... "You lie," [...] Julien declared. [...] "Unless {{you knew}} Paris well, you wouldn't {{be here for}} Number 3 Branch. Tell me, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> {{watching}} me?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then we'll try {{to avoid}} them. All I require <b>is</b> that <b>you</b> <b>still</b> give the lad the entry of this house and don't {{interfere}} with me. You see I'm reasonable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I can {{understand}} that stage of it," [...] said the manager. [...] "By-the-way, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> connected with the Abstract? I noticed the name on your card." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet {{you can now}} hardly {{hope for}} more than a {{laborious}} life and moderate prosperity. The prairie is often dreary, and the toil almost brutalizing. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> content?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Again for {{an instant}} I thought. [...] "The offer I propose to make you gives me the right to address you a {{question}} remarkably direct. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> engaged to Miss Anvoy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No! I'm fairly comf'ble," [...] responded {{the lady}} calmly, [...] "and you're gettin' {{on in the}} vale, ez <b>is</b> natural--though <b>you</b> <b>still</b> kind o' run to bone, as you used." ...|$|R
