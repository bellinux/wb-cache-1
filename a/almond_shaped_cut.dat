50|$|The {{station was}} {{designed}} by the firm of Ellerbe Becket, which received a progressive architecture award for the design. The station design was created {{as a series of}} layers, each of which was unique to its purpose. The most prominent element of the design is the <b>almond</b> <b>shaped</b> structure over the entrance to the station. The <b>almond</b> <b>shape</b> is repeated in an <b>almond</b> <b>shaped</b> balcony overlooking the station. The cost of the station was US$40.5 million.|$|R

50|$|The Algerian mandole is a {{stringed}} instrument, with an <b>almond</b> <b>shaped</b> body, {{built in}} a box like a guitar, but <b>almond</b> <b>shaped</b> like the mandola with a flat back, raised fingerboard, and wide neck (as a guitar's). It can have eight, ten, or twelve strings in doubled courses, and may have additional frets between frets to provide quarter tones. Quarter tones are used to play music with Arab and Turkish melodies. A variation {{is to have the}} thickest strings be single strings instead of double courses. Sound hole is typically diamond shaped, but can be round, and sometimes with rosettes.|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} Computational {{investigation of}} convective heat transfer in turbulent flow past an <b>almond</b> <b>shape</b> dimpled surface. A parametric study is performed with k-ε turbulence model {{to determine the}} effects of Reynolds number of range 25000 to 95000 on heat transfer enhancement. In this paper we have computed heat transfer characteristics in a circular tube as a function of the Reynolds number. The mass flow rate of air varied for getting turbulent flow Reynolds numbers. The <b>almond</b> <b>shape</b> dimple geometry was considered with diameter 10 mm and required elongated length 22. 5 mm. The tube diameter 19 mm and dimple depth 3 mm with ratio L/D = 4. 3 was kept constant [...] The results showed that more heat transfer was occurred downstream of the dimples due to flow reattachment. As the Reynolds number increased, the overall heat transfer coefficient was also increased as compared with base line plain tube with minimum pressure drop penalty...|$|R
