Barrie's Peter Pan {{as part of}} a tribute to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children. An inflatable representation of Lord Voldemort and other children's literary characters accompanied her reading.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} January, Streep {{received}} her 14th Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, lengthening her record from 13 for most nominations by any actor male or female. Field received a Costume Design nomination as well. Neither won, but Blunt and Hathaway presented the last mentioned award, amusing the audience by slipping into their characters for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>lines,</b> nervously asking which of them had gotten Streep her cappuccino. Streep played along with a stern expression before smiling.|$|E
5|$|On May 3, 1969, customs {{agents at}} Toronto International Airport {{detained}} Hendrix after finding {{a small amount}} of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. Four hours later, after a mobile lab confirmed what had been found, he was formally charged with drug possession. Released on $10,000 bail, Hendrix was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. During a performance at Maple Leaf Gardens later that night, he displayed a jovial attitude, joking with the audience and singing <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>lines</b> of mock opera for comedic effect.|$|E

50|$|Within {{a single}} code group area there would usually be {{multiple}} exchange buildings in various locations. The smaller exchanges might have only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred <b>lines</b> with three-digit subscriber numbers, e.g. 200-499. Larger exchanges might have <b>a</b> <b>few</b> thousand <b>lines</b> with four-digit subscriber numbers, e.g. 2000-5999, or five-digit subscriber numbers, e.g. 20000-49999.|$|R
5|$|The song must {{be written}} and sung in the {{national}} language (or one of the national languages) of the country being represented. However, they can also have <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>lines</b> in a different language. The same rule was in the adults' contest from 1966 to 1972 and again from 1977 to 1998. Performers must be nationals of that country or have lived there {{for at least two}} years.|$|E
5|$|The text {{is written}} in gold in Carolingian {{minuscule}} calligraphy, and the gold ink was obtained from an alloy of silver and gold leaf. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>lines</b> or words stand out as they are written in rustic capitals. Over time, the parchment has slightly warped, {{and there is a}} fold {{in the middle of the}} document. It is presented in a permanent exhibition of the State Archives of Lower Saxony in a dimly lit room.|$|E
5|$|Anup Rubens was {{selected}} to compose the film's music and background score in mid March 2013 marking his second collaboration with both Kumar and Chaitanya after Ishq (2012) and Autonagar Surya (2014) respectively. Kumar read the script to Rubens without revealing the film's cast. After Rubens accepted {{a role in the}} film, both met Nagarjuna. Rubens {{said in an interview that}} he worked for fewer days when compared to his previous works and added that Kumar had a small story to tell within every song in the film. Due to Nageswara Rao's death, a song's tune was replaced with another tune and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>lines</b> of the song Nenu Puttanu from the film Prem Nagar (1971).|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} publication described {{little in}} the way of diagnostic characteristics and was only supported by <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>line</b> drawings. This has led to speculation that the bones might actually be petrified wood, akin to the way the original discoverers of Sauroposeidon initially believed their find to be fossilized tree trunks.|$|R

5|$|Dugdale both {{transcribed}} the Boulogne {{agreement and}} made a reference to it, in a footnote in his 1675 Baronage of England. After this the document was absent from history writing for almost three centuries. Dugdale's footnote was mentioned by certain historians, {{but it was not}} until 1965 that the document itself was again used as a source, when Noël Denholm-Young quoted <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>lines</b> from it in his History and Heraldry: 12541310. In 1972, J. R. S. Phillips printed a complete transcription of the Boulogne agreement in his book Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke 13071324.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many species}} of spider, a P. schultzi lays a {{continuous}} dragline of silk as it moves, {{and from time to}} time anchors the dragline to a surface with a spot of sticky silk. This allows the spider to return to the surface if the animal is dislodged. A spider about to jump first lays a sticky silk anchor, and then lays out a dragline as it flies. Unlike those of most jumping spiders, P. schultzi′s draglines stick to each other and, when a P. schultzi has laid <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>lines</b> across a gap, it uses these as walkways and reinforces them with additional silk as it moves.|$|E
5|$|Lux Radio Theatre (CBS, June 1940). Introduced and {{produced}} by Cecil B. DeMille, it featured Irene Dunne, Allan Jones, and Charles Winninger, {{all of whom}} were in the 1936 film version. In this condensed version some songs from the show were sung, but Julie was played by a non-singing Gloria Holden. This version made the biracial Julie a single woman. Only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>lines</b> of Ol' Man River were heard, sung by a chorus. While supposedly based on the 1936 film, this production used the ending of the original show, which the film did not use.|$|E

60|$|Buller {{found himself}} confronted with an {{alarming}} and critical situation in Natal. Practically the whole force {{which had been}} deemed sufficient to protect the Colony was locked up in Ladysmith, and only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>line</b> of communication troops stood between the enemy and the capital or even the seaport. Plainly, therefore, strong reinforcements--at least a division--must be hurried to Natal without an hour's unnecessary delay.|$|R
5|$|Although Orion has <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>lines</b> in both Homeric {{poems and}} in the Works and Days, {{most of the stories}} about him are {{recorded}} in incidental allusions and in fairly obscure later writings. No great poet standardized the legend. The ancient sources for Orion's legend are mostly notes in the margins of ancient poets (scholia) or compilations by later scholars, the equivalent of modern reference works or encyclopedias; even the legend from Hesiod's Astronomy survives only in one such compilation. In several cases, including the summary of the Astronomy, although the surviving work bears the name of a famous scholar, such as Apollodorus of Athens, Eratosthenes, or Gaius Julius Hyginus, what survives is either an ancient forgery or an abridgement of the original compilation by a later writer of dubious competence; editors of these texts suggest that they may have borne the names of great scholars because they were abridgments, or even pupil's notes, based on the works of the scholars.|$|E

Although the demos were well-received, the vocalist Roman Wagner left Sacrificium in 2000. After that, {{the band played}} concerts with bands such as Extol and My Darkest Hate. The second guitarist, Claudio Enzler, started performing vocals, and the guitarist position was taken by Ulrike Uhlmann.|$|R
