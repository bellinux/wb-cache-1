5|$|In July 1930 Troy Middleton {{stopped at}} his new {{headquarters}} at Fort McPherson in Atlanta, then drove west {{with his family to}} Baton Rouge, Louisiana which would become the family home for many years. Major Middleton became the Commandant of cadets <b>at</b> <b>LSU,</b> along with being the professor of military science.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the entry}} of the United States into World War I, in April 1917, Middleton was {{assigned}} to the 4th Infantry Division, and soon saw action as a battalion commander during the Second Battle of the Marne. Three months later, following some minor support roles, his unit led the attack during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, and Middleton became a regimental commander. Because of his exceptional battlefield performance, on 14 October 1918 he was promoted to the rank of colonel, becoming, at the age of 29, the youngest officer of that rank in the American Expeditionary Force (AEF). He also received the Army Distinguished Service Medal for his exemplary service. Following World War I, Middleton served at the U.S. Army School of Infantry, the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School, the U.S. Army War College, and as commandant of cadets <b>at</b> <b>LSU.</b> He retired from the army in 1937 to become dean of administration and later comptroller and acting vice president <b>at</b> <b>LSU.</b> His tenure <b>at</b> <b>LSU</b> was fraught with difficulty, as Middleton became one of the key players in helping the university recover from a major scandal where nearly a million dollars had been embezzled.|$|E

Pritchard coached <b>at</b> <b>LSU</b> for part of one season and was later a Presbyterian dental missionary at Luebo in the Congo until {{he was forced to}} return to the United States due to poor health sometime before 1915.|$|E
5|$|Middleton stayed <b>at</b> <b>LSU</b> until 1942, {{describing}} {{his days as}} the comptroller of LSU as long days {{that he would not}} want to relive, but after the first year he found both the work and his association with Hebert, Borth and Hornbeak to be satisfying and rewarding. He felt that during this period of time, from 1939 to 1941, he was able to make his greatest contribution to an institution that had been very good to him in the past.|$|E
5|$|After a coach saw Wilson pitch well at {{a tournament}} in California, {{he was offered}} a {{scholarship}} to Louisiana State University (LSU), where he played for the LSU Tigers baseball team, eventually becoming their No. 2 starter. In his time <b>at</b> <b>LSU,</b> Wilson pitched in 51 games (22 starts) and accumulated 18 wins, 10 losses, and five saves. He {{was in the middle}} of his third season on March 28, 2003, when he injured his elbow and underwent Tommy John surgery. He also played for the Keene Swamp Bats of the New England Collegiate Baseball League, a summer league for collegiate prospects. Despite facing extensive rehabilitation, Wilson chose to enter the 2003 Major League Baseball draft.|$|E

5|$|After a {{recruiting}} battle between Louisiana State University and the University of Texas, Tittle chose to attend LSU in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and {{play for the}} LSU Tigers. He {{was part of a}} successful 1944 recruiting class under head coach Bernie Moore that included halfbacks Jim Cason, Dan Sandifer, and Ray Coates. Freshmen were eligible to play on the varsity during World War II, so Tittle saw playing time immediately. He later said the finest moment of his four years <b>at</b> <b>LSU</b> was beating Tulane as a freshman, a game in which he set a school record with 238 passing yards. It was one of two games the Tigers won that season.|$|E
5|$|As the {{university}} president, Middleton was constantly involved in personnel decisions, {{some of them}} making national news. One such ordeal occurred in February 1955 when the Board of Supervisors {{decided that it was}} time for the head football coach, Gaynell Tinsley, to be relieved following a break-even record in seven years. His successor, Paul Dietzel, was a 29-year-old assistant coach at the United States Military Academy. Dietzel had a rough beginning <b>at</b> <b>LSU</b> with three losing seasons, and calls for his removal became louder. Middleton supported Dietzel, however, and in his fourth season as coach the LSU Tigers not only had an undefeated season, but also won the Sugar Bowl and were declared the national champions.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{his final}} year on campus, Middleton was once again pressed by the {{university}} president to retire from the army {{and go to work}} for the college. Again, Middleton could not do that, and began looking for a suitable follow-on assignment. Not having been overseas in over sixteen years, he put in a request for duty in the Philippines. He finished his tenure <b>at</b> <b>LSU</b> in the summer of 1936, having overseen the increase in students completing the ROTC program from about 500 to over 1700 cadets.|$|E
50|$|In early March 2016, Jones was {{predicted}} to {{be a second}} round pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. <b>At</b> <b>LSU's</b> pro day Jones had a good day, improving his results in physical drills from the NFL Scouting Combine which had taken place a few weeks earlier.|$|R
50|$|In 1972, Johnson {{joined the}} faculty of the Louisiana State University Law Center, {{eventually}} becoming a full professor in 1978.

5|$|William Abb Cannon (born August 2, 1937) is {{a former}} American {{football}} running back and tight end who played professionally in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL). He attended Louisiana State University (LSU), where he played college football as a halfback and return specialist for the LSU Tigers. <b>At</b> <b>LSU,</b> Cannon was twice unanimously named an All-American, helped the 1958 LSU team win a national championship, and received the Heisman Trophy as the nation's most outstanding college player in 1959. His punt return against Ole Miss on Halloween night in 1959 is considered by fans and sportswriters {{to be one of}} the most famous plays in LSU sports history.|$|E
5|$|During Middleton's tenure <b>at</b> <b>LSU</b> the {{presidency}} of the university changed hands from President Atkinson to President James Monroe Smith, the latter an appointee of Governor Long. Towards the end of Middleton's fourth year on campus President Smith asked him if he would stay on for an additional year and also become Dean of Men. Middlteon responded that he would accept, but it had to be cleared through the War Department. Smith's request to the War Department for both the extension and the deanship for Middleton were approved. Toward the end of the fifth year Smith went a step further, suggesting that Middleton retire from the army and become a permanent member of the LSU staff. Middleton would not even consider retirement, but accepted a sixth year with the ROTC program. As he began his sixth year on campus, on 1 Aug 1935, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 2010 season, the Crimson Tide {{was ranked}} No.1 in the AP and Coaches' Preseason Polls. The No.1 preseason ranking {{was the first}} for Alabama since the 1978 season.

5|$|For the game, Julio Jones set {{a school}} record with 221 {{receiving}} yards, eclipsing the previous mark of 217 yards set by David Palmer against Vanderbilt in 1993. Ingram and Richardson finished with 88 and 119 yards on the ground respectively. For his performance, left tackle James Carpenter {{was selected as the}} SEC Offensive Lineman of the Week. With his 117 yards on 14 carries, Tauren Poole ended Alabama's 41-game streak of not allowing a 100-yard rusher dating back to BenJarvus Green-Ellis's 131 yard performance for Ole Miss in 2007. The game also marked the first between Nick Saban and Derek Dooley who previously worked for Saban as an assistant coach <b>at</b> <b>LSU</b> and with the Miami Dolphins. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Volunteers to 47–38–7 (48–37–8 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Alabama {{came into}} the season ranked No.2 in both preseason polls. After their week-one victory over Michigan, the Crimson Tide moved into the No.1 spot in both polls, and then {{proceeded}} to win their next eight games that included a victory <b>at</b> <b>LSU.</b> However, the next week, Alabama was upset by Johnny Manziel and the Texas A Aggies and dropped to the No.4 position. Alabama bounced back and won its remaining games to clinch the SEC Western Division and secured {{a spot in the}} 2012 SEC Championship Game against Georgia. The Crimson Tide then defeated the Bulldogs and captured the SEC Championship. The next day, Alabama finished No.2 in the final BCS rankings and would play Notre Dame in the 2013 BCS National Championship Game. In the game, Alabama defeated the Fighting Irish 42–14 and captured their 15th national championship and made Nick Saban the only coach in college football to win four BCS Championships.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} that {{followed}} the conclusion of the season, several changes were made to the Alabama coaching staff. On January 9 offensive coordinator Doug Nussmeier was officially hired in the same capacity at Michigan as the replacement for Al Borges. On January 10, former Oakland Raiders, Tennessee and USC head coach Lane Kiffin was hired as the replacement for Nussmeier as both offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. On January 11, it was announced defensive line coach Chris Rumph had resigned and took the same position on the Texas staff. On January 13 USC defensive line coach Bo Davis was hired as Rumph's replacement. Davis previously coached defensive line at Alabama from 2007 to 2010 and had also served under Saban <b>at</b> <b>LSU</b> and with the Miami Dolphins. On February 12, Greg Brown resigned to become the safeties coach at Louisville. Two days later, Kevin Steele was promoted from Alabama's director of player personnel to inside linebackers coach. Steele previously served as a defensive assistant for Saban at Alabama in 2007 and 2008.|$|E

25|$|The 1960s {{were very}} {{challenging}} years for Phi Iota Alpha. The {{effects of the}} Vietnam War and the '60s counter-culture created an anti-institutional atmosphere amongst many college students. In addition, this drastically reduced the enrollment of Latin American students in American universities. This in turn hindered potential membership to the organization. As a result, by 1968, {{after many years of}} struggle, the only active undergraduate chapters were <b>at</b> <b>LSU,</b> and at RPI. The chapter at RPI became inactive in 1973 with the graduation of its Secretary General. The Secretary General took with him the chapter's official fraternity documents. By 1979, the last active brother from the chapter <b>at</b> <b>LSU</b> graduated, thereby marking the closing of the undergraduate chapter <b>at</b> <b>LSU.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because the {{original}} campus {{was designed to}} accommodate 1,500 students, space is now at a premium <b>at</b> <b>LSU.</b> During the 1990s, LSU officials created a set of design guidelines that call for all newly- constructed buildings to have an Italian Renaissance flavor.|$|E
25|$|After the Sewanee win, Alabama {{traveled}} to Nashville where {{they lost their}} only {{game of the season}} against Vanderbilt 16–12.
