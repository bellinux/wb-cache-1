Many injuries have been attributed to poor teaching which can result in improper alignment. This study utilized a teaching technology, TAGteach to aide in skill acquisition of novice yoga practitioners. The current study focused on teaching three beginner asanas (poses) to novice practitioners. The intervention included the asanas being broken down by task analysis and the steps tagged one by one. The intervention was assessed by a multiple baseline across behaviors design. All targeted yoga postures improved upon the implementation of TAGteach and the results maintained after reinforcement was no longer provided and generalized to the yoga class setting.

40|$|A hybrid wind {{instrument}} generates self-sustained sounds via a real-time interaction between a computed physical model of an exciter (such as human lips interacting with a mouthpiece) {{and a real}} acoustic resonator. Successful implementation of a hybrid {{wind instrument}} will not only open up new musical possibilities but will also provide a valuable research tool. However, attempts to produce a hybrid instrument have so far fallen short, {{in terms of both}} the accuracy and the variation in the sound produced. The principal reason for the failings of previous hybrid instruments is the actuator which, controlled by the physical model of the exciter, introduces a fluctuating component into the air flow injected into the resonator. In the present paper, the possibility of using a loudspeaker to supply the calculated excitation signal is explored. A theoretical study using established physical models is carried out, yielding useful rules for choosing the best loudspeaker for a given resonator. <b>Acoustical</b> coupling and <b>feedback</b> stability are considered.

Uncertainty may arise from mis-estimation of the objects' geometry-independent mechanical properties, such as surface stiffness. How multisensory information feeds back into the fine-tuning of sound-generating actions remains unexplored. Participants (percussionists, non-percussion musicians, or non-musicians) held a stylus and learned to control their wrist velocity while repeatedly striking a virtual sounding object whose surface stiffness was under computer control. Sensory feedback was manipulated by perturbing the surface stiffness specified by audition and haptics in a congruent or incongruent manner. The compensatory changes in striking velocity were measured as the motor effects of the sensory perturbations, and sensory dominance was quantified by the asymmetry of congruency effects across audition and haptics. A pronounced dominance of haptics over audition suggested a superior utility of somatosensation developed through long-term experience with object exploration. Large interindividual differences in the motor effects of haptic perturbation potentially arose from a differential reliance {{on the type of}} tactual prediction error for which participants tend to compensate: vibrotactile force vs. object deformation. Musical experience did not have much of an effect beyond a slightly greater reliance on object deformation in mallet percussionists. The bias towards haptics in the presence of crossmodal perturbations was greater when participants appeared to rely on object-deformation feedback, suggesting a weaker association between haptically sensed object deformation and the acoustical structure of concomitant sound during everyday experience of actions upon objects...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{bounded-input bounded-output}} (BIBO) {{stability}} {{condition for the}} recursive functional link artificial neural network (FLANN) filter, based on trigonometric expansions, is derived. This filter is considered {{as a member of}} the class of causal shift-invariant recursive nonlinear filters whose output depends linearly on the filter coefficients. As for all recursive filters, its stability should be granted or, at least, tested. The relevant conclusion we derive from the stability condition is that the recursive FLANN filter is not affected by instabilities whenever the recursive linear part of the filter is stable. This fact is in contrast with the case of recursive polynomial filters where, in general, specific limitations on the input range are required. The recursive FLANN filter is then studied in the framework of a feedforward scheme for nonlinear active noise control. The novelty of our study is due to the simultaneous consideration of a nonlinear secondary path and an <b>acoustical</b> <b>feedback</b> between the loudspeaker and the reference microphone. An output error nonlinearly Filtered-U normalized LMS adaptation algorithm, derived for the elements of the above-mentioned class of nonlinear filters, is then applied to the recursive FLANN filter.

Apart from the annoyance and potential hearing damaging effects that howling implies, it also reduces the supplied maximum Real Ear Aided Gain (REAG). This paper proposes a novel method for subband feedback detection and cancellation, based on the zero-crossing rate measure. After splitting the hearing aid input signal into subbands, the distances between subband zero-crossings are measured. A low distance variance in a particular subband indicates that howling has arisen. The variance measure is then used to adaptively and continuously steer subband gain functions which attenuate tonal infested subbands.

Our data contains ear impressions of 42 hearing aid users, in two different positions: open and closed mouth, and survey data including information about experienced discomfort due to AF. We use weighted support vector machines (WSVM) to investigate the separation between the presence and lack of AF and achieve classification accuracy of 80 % based on the deformation field.

40|$|International audienceLinear source-filter {{theory has}} been {{successfully}} applied to voice analysis and synthesis {{for half a century}} (Fant, 1960). It is based on the strong assumption that source and filter can be modeled separately from each other, and do not interact. This is of course a first-order approximation of the physics of voice production. Several source-filter interaction effects may be observed on glottal flow, such as glottal pulse skewing and formant ripples (Childers and Wong, 1994). Glottal pulse skewing depends on vocal-tract acoustical loading, and it is one aspect of source-filter interaction which has been included in glottal flow models (speed quotient or asymmetry coefficient, Doval et al., 2006). Yet there is little quantitative knowledge about how glottal parameters may vary as a function of source-filter interaction. To explore further this question, a physically-based synthesizer has been used. It is based on a modified two-mass model of the vocal folds coupled to fluid flow description (Ruty et al., 2007). It includes a moving separating point of the airflow within glottal geometry. This model can produce oscillations (flow induced vibrations), and can be considered as a sound source. The produced acoustic wave propagates into a simple description of the vocal tract, which is based on linear acoustics. We can choose to take into account acoustical pressure to calculate transglottal pressure drop. Thus, the synthesizer can be run with (interactive) or without (non-interactive) <b>acoustical</b> <b>feedback</b> on the source. We present the variations in glottal-flow parameters between the interactive and noninteractive conditions. The parameters of interest here are the fundamental period, the open quotient and the asymmetry coefficient (equivalent to speed quotient). Fundamental period is calculated as the duration between two glottal closing instants detected on the synthesized glottal-flow pulse derivative. Glottal open time is measured as the duration between a glottal opening instant and the following glottal closing instant. Glottal opening time is measured as the duration between a glottal opening instant and the following instant of maximal glottal flow. Open quotient is derived as the ratio between glottal open time and fundamental period. Asymmetry coefficient is derived as the ratio between glottal opening time and glottal open time. For a fixed two-mass model configuration, the <b>acoustical</b> <b>feedback</b> is found to affect all glottal parameters, including the glottal fundamental frequency. As expected, modifications in vocaltract geometry only have an impact in the interactive condition. It affects mainly glottal-pulse skewing, but we can also notice an increase of the open quotient, and an increase of the fundamental frequency. References Childers, D. G. & Wong, C. F.

40|$|Insight into {{vocal fold}} and lip {{oscillation}} mechanisms {{is important for}} the understanding of phonation and the sound generation process in brass musical instruments. In general, a simplified analysis of the physical 3 D fluid-structure interaction process between the living tissues and the airflow is favoured by most workers. Several simple models (lumped parameter models) have been proposed and these represent the tissues as a distribution of elastic mass(es). The mass-spring-damper system is acted on by a driving force resulting from the pressure exerted by the airstream. The results from these theoretical models have been validated 'in-vitro' using rigid or deformable replicas mounted in a suitable experimental set-up. Previous research by the authors focused on the prediction of the pressure threshold and oscillation frequency of an 'in-vitro' replica, in the absence and presence of <b>acoustical</b> <b>feedback.</b> In the theoretical model a lip or vocal fold is represented as a simple lumped mass system. The model yielded accurate prediction of the oscillation threshold and frequency. In this paper a new 'in-vitro' set-up is presented, which overcomes some of the limitations of the previous study. By the use of a digital camera synchronised with a light source and of pressure sensors, this set-up allows 1) measurement of the area of the replica opening and 2) imposition of independent initial conditions, such as height of the initial opening and internal pressure in the replica.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [99]- 102) This research presents {{new techniques}} for active noise-control systems. This thesis introduces and applies these new techniques to real-time implementations with success. The {{active noise control}} is achieved {{based on the principle}} of superposition. For instance, an “anti-sound” of equal amplitude and opposite phase is generated and acoustically combined with the unwanted sound. The result is the cancellation of both sounds. One of the most difficult problems with this approach is that the “antisound" is irradiated all over the environment following an <b>acoustical</b> <b>feedback</b> to the input sensor. The approach includes this acoustic feedback {{as a part of the}} whole model. Therefore, poles introduced into the response of the whole model may be compensated for on an adaptive basis by using a pole-zero or adaptive MR filter. The presence of feedback makes filter stability an issue and can impact adversely on the algorithm’s convergence time and the general numerical sensitivity of the filter. Thus the largest obstacle to the wide use of adaptive HR filters is the lack of robustness and a well-understood algorithm for adjusting the required filter gains. This research presents a different algorithm for active noise control as well as introduces the Simplified Hyperstable Adaptive Recursive Filter (SHARF) algorithm to overcome stability problems in the adaptive HR filter. However, the acoustical environment offers more serious difficulties for the adaptive HR filter. A highly reverberant environment produces standing waves and electromechanical resonances in the feedback circuit that could cause instabilities during the adaptive process, especially at low frequencies. To overcome this problem, an optimized Automatic Gain Controller (AGC) was developed. This has a reliable behavior which makes it suitable for the application of the recursive Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm. The algorithm used for active noise control utilizes a model of the acoustical error-path in order to converge. If this model changes for any reason, such as different extreme weather conditions and aged transducers, an on-line modeling becomes necessary in order to make the system track and compensate for those changes. For this reason a new on-line modeling technique is also developed and presented as an alternative to the existent techniques. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|E
40|$|The precise {{nature of}} {{the motion of the}} lips of the {{musician}} is critically important {{to the sound of the}} brass wind instrument. The player must match the oscillation of the lips to the acoustical properties of the instrument and it can take many years of practice to master the techniques involved. Visualisation techniques for capturing the motion of the lips during performance are described and the behaviour of the lips quantitatively analysed using digital image analysis. The concept of an artificial mouth for the sounding of brass wind instruments is discussed and the motion of the artificial lips is compared to that of human musicians. When a brass instrument is played loudly the energy of the higher harmonics increases, creating a distinctive ‘brassy’ timbre. It has been suggested that saturation or constraint of the lips of the musician during extremely loud playing is responsible for this change in sound. Measurements of the motion of the lips of a number of different musicians on different instruments suggest that the lips are not significantly constrained at any playing dynamic, and that it is the phenomena of nonlinear propagation and shockwave generation that is responsible for the increase in energy of the higher harmonics. It is widely accepted that the starting transient of a musical instrument is of great importance to both listener and musician. Previous studies of brass instruments have focused on the steady-state behaviour of the lip-instrument interaction. Measurements of the motion of the lips have been synchronised with the pressure in the mouthpiece of the instrument and the sound radiated from the bell in order to investigate the transient behaviour of the system during both the starting transient and slurs between notes. Thiswork has been extended to include measurements of the pressure in the mouth of the player during the starting transient, and this information used to recreate realistic transients using an artificial mouth. The transient behaviour of the system is clearly affected by the time delay between the start of the note and the <b>acoustical</b> <b>feedback</b> from the instrument beginning. The information obtained can be used to aid in the creation of accurate computational and physical models of brass wind instruments. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
