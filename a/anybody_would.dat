5|$|Whoever {{looks in}} the past and thinks about the time of 1919 to 1932 will be {{overpowered}} by great pain {{in the face of the}} mistakes that have been made. When Hitler published his book Mein Kampf, it was time to begin the most stringent battle against the theories proposed in that book. Hitler proposed to do away with all present parties and institutions, even those brought about after centuries of sacrifices and great exertion. What would a man do if a thief announced a proposed break-in? <b>Anybody</b> <b>would</b> make security arrangements. And what did the government and the representatives of the people do? As much as nothing. A tired, weak and sick population, as well as a weak government, let a charlatan of the worst sort promise them healing. For every problem this quack had the only right medicine. He alone possessed the magic wand that would uproot human weakness and produce angels.|$|E

25|$|Lack of {{sanitation}} {{refers to}} the absence of sanitation. In practical terms it usually means lack of toilets or lack of hygienic toilets that <b>anybody</b> <b>would</b> want to use voluntarily. The result of lack of sanitation is usually open defecation (and open urination but this is of less concern) with associated serious public health issues. It is estimated that 2.4 billion people still lacked improved sanitation facilities as of 2015.|$|E

500|$|Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike {{was officially}} {{announced}} in early 2009 {{with the staff}} confirming the return of Kousuke Toriumi and Mamoru Miyano as the protagonists. Production of the movie started when Tales of Vesperia was still in plot stage. The team discarded {{the idea of making}} an adaptation of the game due to its large length. The team was also against making a sequel or a sidestory due to the required time-consuming character introductions that would make it required to play the game to enjoy. Director Kenta Kamei wanted a movie that <b>anybody</b> <b>would</b> enjoy. As a result, it was decided to make it a prequel as they could explore Yuri and Flynn's background. Kamei was originally involved in the movie parts of the Tales series. When he was assigned as the movie's director, he recalls feeling [...] "honoured, surprised and a bit nervous at the same time".|$|E
500|$|News-Press & Gazette Company {{reviewer}} Shea Conner {{said that}} he could not understand why <b>anybody</b> <b>would</b> buy a seat to a Slipknot concert. Saying [...] "the madness is part of the experience", he added that he himself was [...] "ten feet from the stage with [...] head up and elbows, too." [...] While championing the band as [...] "one of the greatest bands in the world to see live", Conner wrote, [...] "their antics and on-stage spectacle match their ability to get the crowd in a frenzy." [...] Conner noted that due to their large line-up [...] "a few [...] can take a song or two off to entertain the fans," [...] citing events like percussionist Chris Fehn mocking a security guard, DJ Sid Wilson destroying a part of Fehn's drumkit, and Shawn Crahan's hydraulic drumkit with camera-operated screen as particular examples. Katjusa Cisar of The Capital Times reviewed Slipknot's show at the Alliant Energy Center, saying that despite their [...] "satanic" [...] reputation they put on [...] "a pretty wholesome show." [...] She noted that throughout their ten years together they have [...] "honed a show of ferocious, squealing intensity; an unholy racket full of adolescent rage and goofy humor under a phalanx of moving and flashing lights." [...] Crediting frontman Corey Taylor's ability to [...] " [...] his mutant army and the passionate crowd", she said the crowd kept the energy high and that [...] "mosh pits erupted like mini-hurricanes." ...|$|E
500|$|Musician and ambient music pioneer Brian Eno has {{praised the}} album and said, {{regarding}} the song [...] "Soon", that [...] "t {{set a new}} standard for pop. It's the vaguest music ever {{to have been a}} hit." [...] Robert Smith of The Cure discovered Loveless after a period of almost exclusively listening to [...] "disco, or Irish bands like the Dubliners" [...] as a means of avoiding his contemporaries, and said, [...] " [...] was the first band I heard who quite clearly pissed all over us, and their album Loveless is certainly one of my all-time three favourite records. It's the sound of someone [...] who is so driven that they're demented. And the fact that they spent so much time and money on it is so excellent." [...] Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins told Spin, [...] "It's rare in guitar-based music that somebody does something new [...] At the time, everybody was like, 'How the fuck are they doing this?' And, of course, it's way simpler than <b>anybody</b> <b>would</b> imagine." [...] Trey Anastasio of jam band Phish believed that [...] "Loveless [...] the best album recorded in the '90s", and wanted his band to cover the album in its entirety for a Halloween show. Robert Pollard of indie rock band Guided by Voices acknowledged the album as a source of inspiration, noting, [...] "Sometimes when I want to write lyrics, I'll listen to Loveless. Because of the way the vocals are buried, you can almost listen to the songs as if they're instrumental pieces." [...] Loveless has also been said by Jim DeRogatis to have been a considerable influence on British band Radiohead.|$|E

500|$|U2 and McGuinness {{thought that}} too much money had been {{invested}} to abort the concert, and they sympathised with the fans who had travelled to the venue in the poor weather. Accordingly, they decided {{to proceed with the}} concert as planned. However, according to Ezratty, many of the crew were not in agreement and wanted to walk off the set. He said, [...] "The guys from the American sound company were not at all enamored with being out with this band. I can remember them saying, [...] "Oh, we could be out with Asia right now!' So they decided to pull the plug on it. They said, 'It's a matter of safety. We're going to pull the system down and we're not doing to do it.'" [...] McGuinness dissuaded the crew with an impromptu speech, a moment on which Ezratty recollected: [...] "Paul called everybody down into the bowels of Red Rocks where they fed everybody. It was cold and raining and everybody was shivering, and Paul made a speech, saying in no uncertain terms {{that we were going to}} proceed as one, that the band's entire livelihood was riding on this, and that this was one of the most pivotal moments in their career. He said that if it were deemed that this show was in any way possible to happen, it was going to happen, and it was not going to be tolerated that <b>anybody</b> <b>would</b> do anything but add their effort to a successful and positive outcome I just stood there and went, [...] "This is so cool. This is like a general rallying the troops.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Jay Weinberg {{appeared}} {{at a number}} of shows on the first, North American leg, drumming on anywhere from four songs to half the show. [...] He had been a fan of heavy metal music for much of his life, and in playing with Springsteen he integrated a polyrhythmic approach influenced by metal bands such as Lamb of God, Mastodon, and Slipknot with the E Street drumming style derived from big bands and early rock and roll. [...] He received a very positive reaction from both audiences and reviewers as a spark plug for the band, with his vigorous, long-hair-flying style inviting comparisons to Dave Grohl and his potential for replacing his father drawing allusions to Wally Pipp. [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot wrote, [...] "All hail Jay Weinberg. ... With [...] the band’s chemistry was slightly unsettled for the better. ... His fills during 'Radio Nowhere' kicked the song, and the concert, into a higher gear, and galvanized a band that was starting to pace itself." [...] Jay Weinberg said [...] "it's a summer job that <b>anybody</b> <b>would</b> want," [...] while Max Weinberg said Jay's segments allowed him a [...] "total out-of-body experience. For the first time in – I've been with Bruce for 35 years – I've been able {{to go out in the}} audience and enjoy a Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band concert." [...] Jay Weinberg played his first full show on May 14 at the Times Union Center in Albany, New York, as Max Weinberg was in California to prepare test runs for The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien start. [...] Springsteen said of the occasion, “This is the first night in 35 years that somebody else sat at the drums.” Overall, Modern Drummer magazine's editor said that a college freshman playing on one of the year's biggest rock tours was [...] "certainly a unique story". [...] For the final Meadowlands Arena shows of the first leg, Jay Weinberg did the first but his father took a red-eye flight back from Los Angeles to do the second.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to the RSF appeal, {{at the end of}} the two-day summit Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal condemned the kidnapping, adding that he hoped the kidnappers would soon release Johnston, saying that this was [...] "certainly ... not something that anybody, <b>anybody</b> <b>would</b> approve of" [...] and that Johnston was just [...] "doing his job".|$|E
2500|$|A {{police report}} from 1917, {{based on the}} {{testimony}} of the gangster and informer Ralph Daniello, described Gallucci's position around 1912: [...] "At that time Gallucci controlled different gambling games and he would get a percentage on the sale of stolen horses and peddled artichokes. If <b>anybody</b> <b>would</b> not pay this percentage he would either be assaulted, receive blackmail letters or be killed." [...] The report also explained that a Sicilian faction, including three brothers of Giuseppe Morello and his cousins, brothers Fortunato and Tomasso Lomonte, were [...] "working in conjunction with this Galucci, who at all times had been recognized as king." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, Harold Russell {{needed money}} for his wife's medical expenses. In a {{controversial}} decision, he consigned his 1946 Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for The Best Years of Our Lives to Herman Darvick Autograph Auctions, and on August 6, 1992, in New York City, the Oscar sold to a private collector for $60,500. Since he won the award before 1950, he was not required to offer it to the Academy first. Russell defended his decision, saying, [...] "I don't know why <b>anybody</b> <b>would</b> be critical. My wife's health {{is much more important}} than sentimental reasons. The movie will be here, even if Oscar isn't." [...] Harold Russell is the only Academy Award-winning actor to ever sell an Oscar.|$|E

2500|$|The {{press release}} {{indicated}} the book [...] "can't and doesn't {{deal with the}} complex legal aspects of the case" [...] but that [...] "the muddling of facts about Crystal's life, along with North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper's desire {{to settle the dispute}} over open file discovery, swallowed the case whole". Defense attorney Joseph Cheshire responded to the news by saying that if the book was truthful, [...] "I think it would be fabulous, and I don't think <b>anybody</b> <b>would</b> think badly about her in any way, shape or form", but that if the memoir did not acknowledge the falsity of her allegations against the players, that he would advise them to initiate civil action against her. Her book was published later that year. In it, she continued to contend that she had been raped at the party and that the dropping of the case was politically motivated. The book outlined her earlier life, including a claim that she was first raped at the age of 14.|$|E
2500|$|Asher was {{vice-president}} of [...] "21" [...] Brands, a wine and spirits company within the McKesson Corporation, between 1976 and 1978. He then started the Mosswood Wine Company within the McKesson structure to import and distribute European wine across the United States. Meanwhile, Asher's annual California barrel tasting event in New York became highly acclaimed {{in the wine}} world; by 1985, it was being described in newspaper columns as the American wine industry's [...] "most prestigious social event". [...] "Everybody who is anybody {{in the world of}} food and wine is invited to the annual California Vintners Barrel Tasting Dinner," [...] Ruth Riechl wrote for the Los Angeles Times that year; [...] "Ten years ago it was unclear whether <b>anybody</b> <b>would</b> even show up for the first dinner, held at the Four Seasons.

2500|$|Paramount Pictures made an {{announcement}} in late April 2010, revealing that The Last Airbender {{would be released}} in 3D. This decision came after {{an increasing number of}} films being made or converted to 3D, such as Avatar, Alice in Wonderland and Clash of the Titans, made a decent profit at the box office. Although Helman stated that Shyamalan's way of shooting without fast edits and the film's visuals could lend itself to the 3D conversion well, James Cameron voiced his disapproval on any film being converted using this process, saying, [...] "You can slap a 3-D label on it and call it 3-D, but there's no possible way that it can be done up to a standard that <b>anybody</b> <b>would</b> consider high enough." [...] Despite this, Shyamalan opted to work with Stereo D LLC, the company who worked on James Cameron's own Avatar. The conversion process for the film cost between $5 million and $10 million, adding to the reported $100 million that already went into the film.|$|E

2500|$|Kimmel's biggest {{influences}} in comedy are David Letterman and Howard Stern. Kimmel has described Letterman's work as, [...] "His show {{was just so}} weird and different, I'd {{never seen anything like}} it. I didn't know anyone who had a sense of humor like that." [...] Kimmel has often joked that the only reason he got into show business was just so he can be friends with Letterman, he has also questioned why <b>anybody</b> <b>would</b> watch his show instead of Letterman's. Kimmel wrote a piece for Time writing his love for Letterman by saying, [...] "As I write this, there are only 10 shows left before the funniest, most inventive and smartest man who ever wore an Alka Seltzer suit goes fishing for good. None of us who discovered Dave on our own and claimed him as our own {{will ever be able to}} satisfactorily explain to the younger people who didn’t what he did, what he meant and what he means. I guess it doesn’t matter. It’s only an exhibition, not a competition. Thanks Dave. For whatever it’s worth, you’re my favorite." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many famous {{international}} musicians have complimented her vocal prowess. Grammy-award winner Michel Legrand has praised Velasquez, saying, [...] "The {{first time}} I heard her sing, I said to myself, 'what the hell? I {{owe it to}} the rest of the world to introduce this voice to them'. She is the voice with both the range and the heart - which is like none I've ever heard of in my entire career." [...] After singing A Piece of Sky with Velasquez, Legrand exclaimed, [...] "It's tough to sing that song after Barbra Streisand, I will tell you, but to sing with Regine is.. I'm in heaven. She sings so well, she has such an extraordinary technical and sensitive voice and talented expression." [...] When asked who was Brian McKnight's favorite Filipino singer, the 16-time Grammy nominated artist immediately answered Regine Velasquez, [...] "Regine is probably one of the greatest singers I have ever heard anywhere. She can hold her own next to anyone. I doubt that <b>anybody</b> <b>would</b> want to come behind her after she sings." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was a {{financial}} relief of some magnitude when, in 1889, Henry was made Bishop of Tasmania, then still a British colony and Bernard spent his formative years there. Bishop Montgomery considered it {{his duty to}} spend as much time as possible in the rural areas of Tasmania and was away for up to six months at a time. While he was away, his wife, still in her mid-twenties, gave her children [...] "constant" [...] beatings, then ignored them most of the time as she performed the public duties of the bishop's wife. Of Bernard's siblings, Sibyl died prematurely in Tasmania, and Harold, Donald and Una all emigrated. Maud Montgomery took little active interest in the education of her young children other than to have them taught by tutors brought from Britain. The loveless environment made Bernard something of a bully, as he himself recalled, [...] "I was a dreadful little boy. I don't suppose <b>anybody</b> <b>would</b> put up with my sort of behaviour these days." [...] Later in life Montgomery refused to allow his son David {{to have anything to do}} with his grandmother, and refused to attend her funeral in 1949.|$|E
