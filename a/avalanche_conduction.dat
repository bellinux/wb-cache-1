40|$|In this paper, {{a compact}} dynamic and fully coupled {{electrothermal}} model for parasitic BJT latchup is presented and validated by measurements. The {{model can be}} used to enhance the reliability of the latest generation of commercially available power devices. BJT latchup can be triggered by body-diode reverse-recovery hard commutation with high dV/dt or from <b>avalanche</b> <b>conduction</b> during unclamped inductive switching. In the case of body-diode reverse recovery, the base current that initiates BJT latchup is calculated from the solution of the ambipolar diffusion equation describing the minority carrier distribution in the antiparallel p-i-n body diode. For hard commutation with high dV/dt, the displacement current of the drain-body charging capacitance is critical for BJT latchup, whereas for <b>avalanche</b> <b>conduction,</b> the base current is calculated from impact ionization. The parasitic BJT is implemented in Simulink using the Ebers-Moll model and the temperature is calculated using a thermal network matched to the transient thermal impedance characteristic of the devices. This model has been applied to CoolMOS and SiC MOSFETs. Measurements show that the model correctly predicts BJT latchup during reverse recovery as a function of forward-current density and temperature. The model presented, when calibrated correctly by device manufacturers and applications engineers, is capable of benchmarking the robustness of power MOSFETs...|$|E
40|$|Low voltage {{discrete}} power trench n-MOSFETs in TO- 220 packages {{have been}} subjected to over 200 million cycles of repetitive unclamped inductive switching (UIS) at a mounting base temperature of 150 ° C and at different avalanche currents. Hot-hole injection into the gate dielectric during <b>avalanche</b> <b>conduction</b> causes a reduction in the threshold voltage as the number of avalanche cycles increase. The relationship between the change in the threshold voltage and the number of avalanche cycles is shown to be a power-law with the pre-factor dependent on the test conditions and the MOSFET technology. Experiments show that the power law pre-factor is proportional to the avalanche current in agreement with the predictions of the “lucky-electron” model. Interestingly, the pre-factor also responds proportionally to the MOSFETs cell pitch. A 40 % increase in the avalanche current caused a 30 % increase in the power law pre-factor while a 37. 5 % reduction in the MOSFETs cell pitch caused a 40 % reduction in the power law pre-factor. Smaller cell pitch MOSFETs also exhibit improved on-state resistance stability with avalanche cycling however with higher drain-source leakage...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} hot-carrier {{injection}} (HCI) due to repetitive unclamped inductive switching (UIS) on the electrical performance of low-voltage trench power n-type MOSFETs (nMOSFETs) is assessed. Trench power nMOSFETs with 20 - and 30 -V breakdown voltage ratings in TO- 220 packages have been fabricated {{and subjected to}} over 100 million cycles of repetitive UIS with different avalanche currents IAV at a mounting base temperature TMB of 150 °C. Impact ionization during <b>avalanche</b> <b>conduction</b> in the channel causes hot-hole injection into the gate dielectric, which results in a reduction of the threshold voltage VGSTX, {{as the number of}} avalanche cycles N increases. The experimental data reveal a power-law relationship between the change in the threshold voltage ΔVGSTX and N. The results show that the power-law prefactor is directly proportional to the avalanche current. After 100 million cycles, it was observed in the 20 -V rated MOSFETs that the power-law prefactor increased by 30 % when IAV was increased from 160 to 225 A, thereby approximating a linear relationship. A stable subthreshold slope with avalanche cycling indicates that interface trap generation may not be an active degradation mechanism. The impact of the cell pitch on avalanche ruggedness is also investigated by testing 2. 5 - and 4 - m cell-pitch 30 -V rated MOSFETs. Measurements showed that the power-law prefactor reduced by 40 % when the cell pitch was reduced by 37. 5 %. The improved VGSTX stability with the smaller cell-pitch MOSFETs is attributed to a lower avalanche current per unit cell resulting in less hot-hole injection and, hence, smaller VGSTX shift. The 2. 5 -m cell-pitch MOSFETs also show 25 % improved on -state resistance RDSON, better RDSON stability, and 20 % less subthreshold slope compared with the 4 -m cell-pitch MOSFETs, although with 100 % higher initial IDSS and less IDSS stability with avalanche cycling. These results are important for manufacturers of automotive MOSFETs where multiple avalanche occurrences over the lifetime of the MOSFET are expected...|$|E
40|$|A 1. 2 -kV/ 24 -A SiC-MOSFET and a 1. 2 -kV/ 30 -A Si-Insulated gate bipolar {{transistor}} (IGBT) have been electrothermally stressed in unclamped inductive switching conditions at different ambient temperatures ranging from - 25 °C to 125 °C. The devices have been stressed with avalanche currents at their rated currents and 40 % higher. The {{activation of the}} parasitic bipolar junction transistor (BJT) during <b>avalanche</b> mode <b>conduction</b> results from the increased body resistance causing a voltage drop between the source and body, greater than the emitter-base voltage of the parasitic BJT. Because the BJT current and temperature relate through a positive feedback mechanism, thermal runaway results {{in the destruction of}} the device. It is shown that the avalanche power sustained before the destruction of the device increases as the ambient temperature decreases. SiC MOSFETs are shown to be able to withstand avalanche currents equal to the rated forward current at 25 °C, whereas IGBTs cannot sustain the same electrothermal stress. SiC MOSFETs are also shown to be capable of withstanding avalanche currents 40 % above the rated forward current though only at reduced temperatures. An electrothermal model has been developed to explain the temperature dependency of the BJT latchup, and the results are supported by finite-element models...|$|R
40|$|Partial {{discharges}} which {{emanate from}} solid dielectrics immersed in insulating oil when high impulse voltages are applied under different environmental temperatures (20, 40 and 80 °C) are discussed. The solid dielectrics {{used for the}} measurements are phenol-impregnated pressboard and industrial bakelite. The samples are cut in wafers of 150 mm diameter and are 1 or 2 mm thick. The insulating oil is a typical transformer oil. The switching type of the impulse voltage used, 250 / 2500 μs, corresponds to functional situations and is long enough to produce the effects that can be detected without the consideration of charge transfer phenomena due to fast rates of field changes. Experimental {{results show that the}} total charge transfer due to partial discharges is increased by temperature. A possible explanation of the undergoing physical process may be that in the low-field regime, temperature perturbation effects on the injected current are characterized by the conductivity changes in the volume of the dielectric, while as partial discharges start occurring, <b>avalanche</b> multiplication of <b>conduction</b> electrons appears to be the dominant phenomenon, characterizing the behavior of a metal/thick insulator/metal structure in the high-field regime. The circuits, measurement, and measuring procedures are discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this talk, I {{will focus}} on the {{specificities}} of diamond power devices, from the simulation of Field Effect high voltage Transistors (FET) to the characterization and implementation of diamond devices in power converters. Indeed, diamond has unique electrical and thermal properties and dedicated simulation and characterization tools are required [1]. Moreover, to demonstrate the full potential of diamond in power electronics, high temperature operation above 200 °C is required to reduce conduction losses and reach higher figure of merits [2 - 4]. However, typical electronics associated with diamond power devices will have eventually to work at such high temperatures, with high constraints on reliability. Possible solutions to guarantee low conduction losses and high switching speed with diamond power devices will be presented. In this context, I will first present the recent research on simulation of diamond power devices, with a special focus on FET and drift region optimization (contribution of contact, access, channel and drift region resistance to the total ON state resistance). The transient dV/dt immunity of different FET architectures has been studied and will be presented, with design constraints above 200 kV/µs to guarantee low switching losses. Model accuracy (<b>avalanche</b> breakdown, <b>conduction</b> mechanisms, impurity modelling) and convergence issues (2 D and 3 D structures, transient analysis, temperature dependence) will be discussed. Finally, characterization and implementation of diamond power devices in a 100 W power commutation cell will be described. A particular focus will be done on self-heating during measurements (DC, pulsed DC, large signal switching), dedicated high temperature - high speed gate drivers and optimized power commutation cell. New prospects such as monolithic integration for diamond power electronics will be briefly introduced. Although a lot of work is still remaining on the material side, it is indeed the right time to push forward the diamond power electronics. The research leading to these results has been performed within the GreenDiamond project ([URL] and received funding from the European Community's Horizon 2020 Programme (H 2020 / 2014 - 2020) under grant agreement n° 640947...|$|R
