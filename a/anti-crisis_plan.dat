Asubchapter of the paper analyzes investments as the main solution in order for Romania toget out of the economic crisis. There are presented the anti-crisis solutions offered by theRomanian Government, by setting the tax and budgetary strategy for the 2011 - 2013 yearsand those offered by the Alliance of the Employers' Unions in Romania. We havecompared the two strategies and we have reached the conclusion that the state and theprivate companies see {{the way out of the}} crisis absolutely differently. The RomanianGovernment only brings solutions for short term, and the Alliance of the Employers' Unionbrings practical long-term solutions, in order to revive the Romanian economy. The pieceof the puzzle that is missing is the communication between the two institutions and theattempt to draw up an <b>anti-crisis</b> <b>plan</b> together, for the good of the Romanian economy...|$|E
40|$|In April 2010 Bulgarian {{government}} announced {{an economic and}} social plan targeted on counteracting the swift economic downfall and hopefully, on helping the economic recovery. The way the plan was launched and the character {{of some of the}} measures created a lot of comments, rejection and controversy among the economic agents in the country. That inspired the main idea of that paper - to look more carefully into the plan. First section outlines roughly the global response to the financial crisis. Section 2 observes the government <b>anti-crisis</b> <b>plan</b> in some detail; the third features plan’s specifics summarizing it as a fire plan, comprised of a bunch of neo-liberal measures targeted on shrinking belts and relying on the self-sufficient ability of private business to overcome the recession. Section 4 tries to answer the question – why the plan is as it is - and pays attention to the objective determinants of the plan, to the “ideologemes” which frame the economic thinking of policy makers and points out the first results and the first cracks of that plan. Finally, the paper concludes that, a radical shift away from the neoliberal economic policy seems more and more as an unavoidable decision. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of my {{bachelor}} thesis is {{to analyze and}} compare steps against crisis, which were proposed in the Czech Republic to alleviate {{the effects of the}} Financial Crisis there. I focus mainly on the National <b>anti-crisis</b> <b>plan</b> and its possible alternatives. The whole analysis is based on available empirical dates. In a theoretical part I deal with current financial and economic crisis {{from the point of view}} of economic theory. I focus mainly on the theory of Financial Crisis and the theory of the Business Cycle. In the second part I deal with indicators of current Financial Crisis and I describe the current state of world economy as a result of financial and economic crisis. Then I analyze rescue packages and I focus on some individual steps to mitigate negative impacts of the Financial Crisis in the Czech Republic. Then I describe some potential impacts of those steps to the Czech economy. At last, but not at least I focus on steps, which are the most effective ones from my point of view and I describe their positive effects on the Czech economy...|$|E
40|$|The current global {{financial}} crisis {{originated in the}} United States of America because of combination of several facts, such as the "dot-com bubble" {{at the beginning of}} the 21 st century, often criticised FED's actions, inconsiderate granting credit to higher-risk borrowers, securitization of this sub-prime mortgages, and resulting the real estate bubble and it's burst. The mortgage crisis, which subsequently overgrew into the world financial crisis, was transmitted in almost all economies in the world thanks to progressing globalisation and interdependence between states. The Czech Republic was affected mainly by indirect channels from the Euro Area, especially from Germany, our biggest trading partner. Not only exporters, whose orders are declining, who are obliged to lower costs and discharge employees, feel the negative impacts. Banks made terms of credit more restrictive for households as well as for enterprises. The Czech economy is probably from October 2008 in recession and for year 2009 is according to the estimates from the Czech State Bank, International Monetary Fund, or European Commission, even deeper decline in GDP expected. Our government have prepared an <b>anti-crisis</b> <b>plan</b> and precautions, but they still don't have a definitive form due to the instability and changes on Czech political scene...|$|E
40|$|The {{crisis of}} {{authority}} in the U. S. S. R. (1988 - July 1991). After a preliminary reference to the ideological options open to Mikhail Gorbachev, initiator of the break-up of Stalinism, and the mistrust which be inspires, both among some of his opponents as well as among right-wing conservatives, the author considers the recent evolution of the Soviet Union, from the monopoly of Party rule to the difficult birth of a pluralistic regime. He first {{raises the question of}} the Party's attitude to perestroika. Article 6 of the Constitution of 1977, which aknowledges the leading role of the Party, was reluctantly annulled by Gorbachev, but annuled it was, thus leaving the way open for pluralism. Condemnation of factionalism within the body of the Party has not prevented the emergence of various "tendencies" (particularly the democratic Platform and the marxist Platform) which find official expression. Similarly, political and social groupings, independent of authority, began to proliferate : from groupings moved by a common principle, for example tne Safeguarding of the national heritage, or the defense of the environment, they rapidly became popular fronts, lending the system a de facto pluralism which would only later enjoy a de jure existence. This spontaneous development took shape first of all in the Baltic countries, and then with increasing momentum spread to all the republics. In parallel with this, the communist Party leadership initiated a reform of the political system, which found expression in the semi-free elections of March 1989, marked by the defeat of various party and State notables. This {{was the beginning of a}} multi-party system, there having been two major opposing tendencies during the campaign for the regional elections in the spring of 1990 : the democratic Russia bloc (liberal) and the patriotic Russian bloc (conservative), surrounded by a multiplicity of organizations of the most diverse and constantly evolving tendencies. The charge levelled against them is that they have no autonomous ideas or initiative, and have only one single programme : mass rejection of the Party apparatus. Some observers are of the opinion that a deep schism will develop within the CPSU, and that this will give rise to a real multi-party system. The first stage of this development has just begun, with the movement for democratic reforms, which was launched in July 1991 by frontline reformers. The other major problem which arises is that of the preservation or the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The authority of the Center is in question, and already six republics have decided to leave the union, proclaiming their sovereignty loud and long (the three Baltic states, Armenia, Georgia and Moldavia). But although the right of scission is officially acknowledged, its implementation is a vast battleground (see the law of 3 rd April 1990). The upsurge of centrifugal forces has led the republics, one after the other, to proclame their sovereignty (primacy of republican laws over federal laws, economic autonomy, ownership of the soil and mineral deposits, etc.) or their outright indépendance. Autonomous Republics and territories followed suit, opposing the authorities of the republics to which they belonged. Inter-ethnic conflict broke out all over. The dispute over federal authority led to a "way over laws", setting the Centre at odd with republics resolved to insist on recognition of their rights (ownership of all the ressources found on their territory, freedom to exploit these resources, etc.). In this context, the question of finance and the budget had pride of place, together with that of material and technological supplies. The entire supply system was disorganized, with the republics refusing to carry out the orders of the State, or to deliver consumers' goods outside of their frontiers, in order to avoid a worsening of their own shortages. The Soviet government tried to combat the supply problems, at least in part, by setting up commodity markets. A series of economic programms was worked out, including V. Pavlov's <b>anti-crisis</b> <b>plan</b> (April 1991) which was adopted by the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, but it is not entirely clear how the economic responsabilities will be apportioned among the Central authorities, the republics and the lower-rank administrative bodies, and what will be the share of the state and private sectors. Also, it is not known how he proposes to overcome the present crisis, and how long this will take. Another major source of discord is the army and the police. The republics demand the right to raise armed forces, and to assume the responsability for maintaning order within their territory. Certain of them, who have been the victims of attacks by the special forces of the Ministry of Interior, the OMON, have organized militias and defense groups, wich are virtually republican armies in embryo. In the end, there was an overriding necessity for redefining the Union, and the first version of the new Union Treaty was adopted by referendum on the 17 th March 1991. A slightly modified version of it was published on the 19 th June, but neither the one nor the other gives a very clear idea of the respective areas of competence and the common areas of competence of the Centre and the constituent republics of the Union (and still less of the fate in store for secessionist republics). On the other hand, one can be sure that the Treaty will be the source of innumerable controversies and disputes, especially on the particularly explosive issue of the budget, taxation and the distribution of ressources. In the final part, the author ventures some thoughts on the future. He sets perestroika in the continuing context of the history of the Russian empire, recalling that the demands made (individual freedoms and democracy, self-determination and decolonization) were already those of the protagonists of the Russian democratic revolution of February-March 1917, which was "taken over" by the Bolshevik coup d'Etat. Now that the empire has fallen victim to its contradictions and weaknesses, and finally disintegrated, what will take its place ? The cure prescribed by the Union Treaty seems ill-adapted to the task, and several outcomes are possible : a resolute commitment to the way of democracy and decolonization, a return to an authoritarian régime but one establishing a market economy, the option of passivity while waiting for a solution "which will come of itself, or a return to thorough-going, tough dictatorship accompanied by a blood bath. If Gorbachev does not once more take his courage in both hands, and proceeds to decolonize the empire, however slow and piecemeal the process, others will do it for him. And in that case, we may fear the worst. Ministère de l'intérieur, les OMON, ont organisé des milices et des groupes d'autodéfense qui sont autant d'armées républicaines en germe. La nécessité de redéfinir l'Union a fini par s'imposer et la première version du nouveau traité de l'Union a été adoptée par référendum le 17 mars 1991. Une version un peu modifiée en a été publiée le 19 juin mais ni l'une, ni l'autre ne délimitent très précisément les compétences respectives et les compétences communes du Centre et des républiques constitutives de l'Union (et encore moins le sort qui sera réservé aux républiques sécessionnistes). En revanche, on peut être certain que le traité sera la source d'innombrables controverses et conflits et notamment sur le point particulièrement explosif du budget, de la perception des impôts et de la répartition des ressources. Dans la dernière partie, l'auteur s'aventure à faire quelques réflexions sur l'avenir. Il replace la perestroïka dans la continuité historique de l'empire russe, rappelant que les revendications (libertés individuelles et démocratie, auto-détermination des peuples et décolonisation) étaient déjà celles des acteurs de la révolution démocratique russe de février-mars 1917, « confisquée » par le coup d'État bolchevik. A présent que l'empire s'est écroulé, victime de ses contradictions et de ses faiblesses, par quoi sera-t-il remplacé ? La thérapie du traité de l'Union paraît mal adaptée et plusieurs issues sont possibles : un engagement résolu sur la voie de la démocratie et de la décolonisation, le retour à un régime autoritaire mais instaurant l'économie de marché, le choix de la passivité et l'attente, fort risquée, d'une solution « qui s'imposera d'elle-même » ou le retour à une dictature pure et dure, s'accompagnant d'un bain de sang. Si Mikhail Gorbatchev ne fait pas une nouvelle fois preuve de courage en décolonisant l'empire, serait-ce lentement et par étapes, d'autres s'en chargeront. Et dans ce cas, le pire est à craindre.
