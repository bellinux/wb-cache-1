5|$|As {{with other}} ratites, emus have a {{relatively}} low basal metabolic rate compared to other types of birds.

5|$|The cost of {{hospice care}} may {{be met by}} health {{insurance}} providers, including Medicare or Medicaid for eligible Americans. Hospice is covered 100% with no co-pay or deductible by Medicare Part A except that patients are responsible for a copay for outpatient drugs and respite care, if needed. (Respite care may be necessary, for instance, if a family member who is providing home hospice care is briefly unable to perform his or her duties and an alternative care provider becomes necessary.) As of 2008, Medicare was responsible for around 80% of hospice payments, reimbursing providers differently from county to county with <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> for inpatient hospice care. A lower rate is paid for home care, with <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> paid for round-the-clock nursing care {{in order to get}} a patient's symptoms under control.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} landowner's land tax paid in {{a portion of}} their crop yield, the poll tax and {{property}} taxes were paid in coin cash. The annual poll tax rate for adult men and women was 120 coins and 20 coins for minors. Merchants were required to pay <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> of 240 coins. The poll tax stimulated a money economy that necessitated the minting of over 28,000,000,000 coins from 118 BC to 5 AD, an average of 220,000,000 coins a year.|$|E
5|$|Deep sky {{surveys show}} that galaxies are often found in groups and clusters. Solitary galaxies that have not {{significantly}} interacted with another galaxy of comparable mass during the past billion years are relatively scarce. Only about 5% of the galaxies surveyed {{have been found to}} be truly isolated; however, these isolated formations may have interacted and even merged with other galaxies in the past, and may still be orbited by smaller, satellite galaxies. Isolated galaxies can produce stars at <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> than normal, as their gas is not being stripped by other nearby galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Integration {{failure is}} rare, {{particularly}} if a dentist's or oral surgeon's instructions are {{followed closely by}} the patient. Immediate loading implants may have <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> of failure, potentially due to being loaded immediately after trauma or extraction, but the difference with proper care and maintenance is well within statistical variance {{for this type of}} procedure. More often, osseointegration failure occurs when a patient is either too unhealthy to receive the implant or engages in behavior that contraindicates proper dental hygiene including smoking or drug use.|$|E

5|$|Most {{people on}} {{antipsychotics}} have side effects. People on typical antipsychotics {{tend to have}} <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> of extrapyramidal side effects, while some atypicals are associated with considerable weight gain, diabetes and risk of metabolic syndrome; this is most pronounced with olanzapine, while risperidone and quetiapine are also associated with weight gain. Risperidone has a similar rate of extrapyramidal symptoms to haloperidol. It remains unclear whether the newer antipsychotics reduce the chances of developing neuroleptic malignant syndrome or tardive dyskinesia, a rare but serious neurological disorder.|$|E
5|$|People {{who live}} in large cities have <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> of COPD {{compared}} to people {{who live in}} rural areas. While urban air pollution is a contributing factor in exacerbations, its overall role as a cause of COPD is unclear. Areas with poor outdoor air quality, including that from exhaust gas, generally have higher rates of COPD. The overall effect in relation to smoking, however, is believed to be small.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch Navy {{had already}} {{acquired}} {{a quantity of}} the Hispano Suiza 20mm guns before the war for mounting in torpedo boats and other craft and 6 of these were mounted in the cruiser Jacob van Heemskerck when she made her escape to Britain in 1940. The Hispano fired similar 20 × 110 ammunition to the Oerlikon but had <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> of fire and slightly higher muzzle velocity. The Hispano Suiza however was to prove insufficiently durable for shipboard use and would find its niche as a highly successful aircraft gun.|$|E

Like the earlier F-5s, the test F-20s were equipped with two M39 cannon mounted in the nose. Production F-20s may have substituted two Ford Aerospace Tigerclaw cannons instead of the M39s; while the Tigerclaw was based on the M39, it was lighter and had <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> of fire than the M39A2.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's.

It was a chance for players from both countries to gain a psychological advantage ahead of the Test matches, and Tallon was selected ahead of Saggers despite conceding byes at <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> in the opening tour matches.

Noise impacts the behavior of horses and certain kinds of noise may contribute to stress: A 2013 study in the UK indicated that stabled horses were calmest in a quiet setting, or if listening to country or classical music, but displayed signs of nervousness when listening to jazz or rock music. This study also recommended keeping music under a volume of 21 decibels. An Australian study found that stabled racehorses listening to talk radio had <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> of gastric ulcers than horses listening to music, and racehorses stabled where a radio was played had a higher overall rate of ulceration than horses stabled {{where there was no}} radio playing.|$|E
