40|$|The main {{beneficiaries}} {{of tax cuts}} are those who don’t really need the additional money, writes Robert Tanton • WE ALL like more money in our pockets – it helps to pay the bills, get the things we need or want, and makes life that bit easier for us. Even better is when we don’t have to do any more work for the additional money, which is what a tax cut provides. More money, same job, same responsibilities – it’s an all win situation. However, some recent analysis done at NATSEM points out that it isn’t as simple as that. The table below shows who gains from increasing the tax free threshold from $ 6, 000 to $ 10, 000 per year in 2011. Table 1 : Estimated increase in family disposable income {{as a result of}} increasing the tax free threshold from $ 6, 000 to $ 10, 000, $ per week in 2011, by income decile 1 – $ 02 – $ 03 – $ 1. 604 – $ 4. 105 – $ 8. 206 – $ 11. 607 – $ 14. 008 – $ 16. 209 – $ 18. 8010 – $ 20. 20 Source: STINMOD 09 /AThe surprising result from this table is that those in the bottom 2 deciles of income receive nothing from the change in the tax free threshold, while those earning in the top decile get an extra $ 20 per week in their pocket. This is because those in the bottom 2 deciles of the income distribution are usually on government benefits, like the aged pension, disability support pension or newstart allowance. They therefore will not pay tax, and so the change in the tax free threshold has no effect on them. However, those in the top income decile pay the greatest amount of tax, so any change to the thresholds has the greatest effect on them, even if it is a change to this bottom tax free threshold. Because Australia (and most developed countries) use marginal tax rates, this is money they would previously have been paying 45 cents in the dollar tax, and they are now paying no tax on another $ 4000 per year (assuming they are earning more than $ 180, 000 per year). So {{it can be seen that}} even a change to the threshold at this low end of the tax scale doesn’t benefit everyone, and benefits those in the top decile of the income distribution the greatest. This is why, when the Gillard Government recently considered tax changes in response to a tax on carbon emissions, the adjustment was understood to be a low income tax offset rather than a tax cut. This offset uses a tax rebate to target low income earners, rather than a change to the tax thresholds or tax rates which affects everyone paying tax. The tax offset can provide tax cuts to low and middle income earners without delivering tax relief to high income workers. Having said this, the low income tax offset still only affects low income workers, and has no effect on people on allowances and benefit payments. So if the policy is to help those on low incomes pay for increased power bills as a result of a tax on carbon emission, then those on Government benefits also need assistance through rebates on their power bills or increases in pensions and allowances, and this has also been suggested by the Government. What this analysis has pointed out to me is a couple of things. One is the complexity of the tax system. If you asked someone in the street who would benefit most from an increase in the tax free threshold from $ 6, 000 to $ 10, 000, my guess is that they would say low income earners would gain most. Yet this analysis shows that they gain the least. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> is the importance of doing some modelling before implementing any policy. To their credit, the Government knows this, and has been crunching the numbers on this policy, and there are models that allow this type of analysis for the tax system (including NATSEM’s STINMOD model, which is used by Treasury for most of this Tax/Transfer analysis). So who needs tax cuts? Certainly not those on very low incomes who are not working, as a tax cut won’t provide any additional money in their pockets. The main {{beneficiaries of}} tax cuts are those who don’t really need the additional money – those in the top decile of the income distribution. •Robert Tanton is Principal Research Fellow at the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (NATSEM) Photo: Andrew Jeffre...|$|E
40|$|Controlling {{internal}} parasites Cue: Internal parasites, such as worms, {{are one of}} {{the most}} common factors affecting the health of goats. In fact goats are more vulnerable to these parasites than either cattle or sheep. If a goat suffers from an infestation of worms, the effects on its health are serious, and sometimes fatal. Blood sucking worms, which live in the animal?s gut are the most common problem. These can make the goat anaemic and unhealthy, unable to grow or breed properly. Controlling internal parasites is therefore one of the most important factors in goat production. Many farmers use deworming medicines, and if used regularly these can help to maintain a healthy flock. There are also other management practices that reduce the risk of worm infestation. Worm eggs and larvae are spread in the dung of the animal, so hygiene in goat pens is important. Farmers should avoid grazing there goats on wet or swampy ground. Bushy areas are more likely to be free from worms. Dr Kanemanema, District Veterinary Officer in Lusaka, Zambia, explained more about the problem of internal parasites, and how they can be tackled, to Chris Kakunta. IN:		?In goats we have round worm infestation ?? OUT:		??in preventing worm infestation? Very much. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 09 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr Muzumbwe Kanemanema, District Veterinary Officer based in Lusaka, Zambia, on how farmers can reduce worm infestation in their goat flocks. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Kanemanema	In goats we have round worm infestation, tape worm infestation and they do cause a lot of harm to goat production. Kakunta	For a lay man, a small scale farmer, how can they know that their goats are infested with worms? Kanemanema	A lay man or a farmer will realise that his goats are infested with worms from, one: goats might be showing signs of diarrhoea. The faecal matter will not be forming those round pellets, it will be in form of diarrhoea. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> is the coats; the hair will be looking dry and they might be showing signs of pot belly. If the infestation is too high the worms might even be showing in the dung. From the faeces which the goats will drop, a farmer might notice that there are small round worms there. Kakunta	Now in the event that the farmer notices these symptoms what should they do? Kanemanema	Once a farmer notices these symptoms then he should look for medicines we call dewormers, medicines which get rid of worms. These medicines are in various preparations, there are some preparations which are in oral form which can be given in liquid form or in tablet form. Other preparations are in the injectable form. Kakunta	Apart from the medicines that you have talked about what else can a farmer do? Perhaps prevention at this point would be important? Kanemanema	Yes prevention normally when you are keeping goats is very important and a routine procedure should be arrived at where goats are dewormed every so often, especially during the rainy season because the worm infestation is too high during rainy season, or the wet season favours the worm multiplication. Kakunta	Now in terms of this regime, perhaps you can elaborate more so that our listeners would be able to follow how exactly this prevention can be done successfully? Kanemanema	With the use of dewormers goat farmers should deworm their goats at least 3 times in a year. And these 3 times, one should be at the beginning of the rainy season, then the second one should be at the middle of the rainy season and the third one should be at the end of the rainy season. If a farmer does this he will find that his goats will be more healthy and their production would be very good. He will realise profits out of it. Kakunta	As we come close to the end of the interview Dr Kanemanema, could you perhaps just recap some of the important factors that a farmer should follow in keeping the goats healthy especially with internal parasites? Kanemanema	Yes the farmer should make sure that his animals or his goats are dewormed in the frequency we have mentioned and then maybe the housing also matters, it will help on the prevention of these infestations. Because if the goats are going to be sleeping around in the dung, say if one goat is infested and is shedding those eggs and larvae in the faeces then the other goats might pick it. So housing should be in such a way that the dung is dropping down, whereby the animals are not coming into contact with the dung. Kakunta	What type of housing are we talking about? Kanemanema	A raised house where the floor should actually be allowing dung to go down. Kakunta	Can farmers manage to construct such a structure? Kanemanema	It is very easy to construct, it is wooden constructed and you know goat dung is in pellets, just the gaps in between the poles down there should be allowing these pellets to drop down. Kakunta	So a simple wooden structure can actually go a long way in preventing worm infestation? Kanemanema	Very much. End of track. Detecting a worm problem, use of deworming medicines including routine seasonal use, housing that reduces worm infestation...|$|E
5000|$|Orin S. Kerr {{also agreed}} with James Dempsey that the {{sections}} were uncontroversial, {{and he also}} argued they should be kept. He explains that Internet communications are not {{dealt with in the}} Fourth Amendment, which offers no protection to information disclosed to third parties [...] "and gives those third parties unlimited power to search through documents in their possession <b>and</b> disclose <b>the</b> results to law enforcement." [...] This gap, Kerr argues, triggered a need for Congressional regulation which was satisfied in 1986 by the passing of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) which placed limitations on information that may be voluntarily disclosed by ISPs, and on information that an ISP may be compelled to give to investigators. He says that [...] "the basic goal of the statute is to create Fourth Amendment-like protections for Internet communications" [...] and that sections 209, 212 and 220 are all amendments to the ECPA. However, Kerr argues that while the ECPA was a necessary piece of legislation, Congress overlooked three key things. One is exigent circumstances for the obtaining of records (he argues that the Fourth Amendment had such an exception for physical search <b>and</b> seizures). <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> was that Title III provided a high level of protection for stored voicemail, but almost no privacy protection for opened voicemail; consequently [...] "if the government knew that there was one copy of an unopened private message in a person's bedroom and another copy on their remotely stored voicemail, it was illegal for the FBI to simply obtain the voicemail; the law actually compelled the police to invade <b>the</b> home <b>and</b> rifle through peoples' bedrooms so as not to disturb the more private voicemail", <b>and</b> that <b>the</b> law made it extremely difficult for law enforcement agencies to gain access to such stored voicemail. Thirdly, Congress introduced [...] "needless delay" [...] when they disallowed federal investigators from obtaining orders to compel information in one district and have them served on third parties in other districts - before section 220 was introduced Kerr gives the example of a New York-based investigator having to travel to California to compel an ISP to disclose information about a New York-based defendant. Kerr argues that sections 209, 202 and 220 correct such defects in <b>the</b> ECPA <b>and</b> that [...] "in all three cases, the Patriot Act attempts to bring the statutory surveillance law into alignment with the Fourth Amendment." ...|$|R
