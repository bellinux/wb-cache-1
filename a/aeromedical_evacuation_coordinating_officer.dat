The air crewman assists the pilot with communication; navigation; and landing by providing the pilot with accurate clearance; helicopter safety; and operating the rescue winch. A rescue crewman's duties include going down the winch, scaling cliff faces and swimming. Rescue crew are also responsible for passenger safety during Passenger Transport Operations. Special Casualty Access Team (SCAT) paramedics possess skills in intensive care / Advance Life Support (ALS) and trauma management; and have skills in accessing and treating patients in difficult or remote locations. SCATs {{work closely with the}} local accredited rescue units to access, assess, triage and treat patients. When required, SCATs may also provide assistance with the extrication of the patient. They provide patient care and are responsible for preparing the <b>aeromedical</b> <b>evacuation</b> missions, <b>coordinating</b> with the flight crew and other medical personnel, as well as liaising with retrieval services. Doctors specially qualified in Emergency Care and retrieval medicine are also part of the team. This enables the crew to provide critical care to a patients anywhere it is needed.|$|R

40|$|Effective <b>aeromedical</b> <b>evacuation</b> of {{casualties}} {{is one of}} the most important problems in military medical systems because high-priority casualties will not survive without timely medical care. The decision making process for <b>aeromedical</b> <b>evacuation</b> consists of the following components: (1) identifying which <b>aeromedical</b> <b>evacuation</b> asset (see figure 1) to dispatch to the casualty, (2) locating <b>aeromedical</b> <b>evacuation</b> assets strategically in anticipation of incoming demand, and (3) deciding which medical treatment facility to transport the casualty. These decisions are further complicated because prioritization {{of casualties}} is based on severity of injury while <b>aeromedical</b> <b>evacuation</b> assets and medical treatment facilities operate with varying capabilities.
