40|$|Zinc from {{zinc chelate}} of {{amino acids hydrate}} would not exert {{additional}} or different adverse effects in target species than those observed for zinc from authorised inorganic sources. Consequently it is concluded that the zinc chelate of amino acids hydrate is a safe source of zinc for all animal species, considering the maximum authorised contents for total zinc <b>in</b> <b>feedingstuffs.</b> The use of zinc chelate of amino acids hydrate as feed additive {{is not expected to}} modify the current consumer exposure to zinc. Therefore, no concerns for consumer safety are expected from the use of zinc chelate of amino acids hydrate in animal nutrition up to the maximum authorised levels of total zinc <b>in</b> <b>feedingstuffs.</b> The <b>additive</b> should be considered as a skin and eye irritant and, due to its amino acid/peptide component, as a skin sensitiser. The risk of exposure by inhalation would be low. The use of zinc as a feed additive does not pose a direct concern for the soil compartment. However, there is a potential environmental concern related to drainage and run-off of zinc to surface water. Most vulnerable for these processes are acid sandy soils. In order to draw a final conclusion, some further refinement to the assessment of zinc-based feed <b>additives</b> <b>in</b> livestock needs to be considered, for which additional data would be required. The use of zinc-containing feed <b>additives</b> <b>in</b> aquaculture up to maximum authorised zinc level in feeds is not expected to pose an appreciable risk to the environment.

40|$|Quantification of {{traces of}} {{processed}} animal proteins (PAPs) <b>in</b> <b>feedingstuffs</b> is an important requirement to enforce upcoming European legislation. One of the techniques proposed {{in this context is}} real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR). A challenge in this field is the fact that real time PCR measures DA copy numbers, whereas legislation will express tolerance limits in terms of mass fractions of PAPs <b>in</b> <b>feedingstuffs.</b> Here we evaluated the impact of different sterilisation temperatures, showing that at high temperatures the DNA copy number was significantly reduced. In addition we showed that measuring at travel levels could lead to a high variation of the measured DNA copy number, characterised by a positively skewed distribution.

40|$|Zinc oxide {{is a safe}} {{source of}} zinc for all animal species and no {{concerns}} for consumer safety are expected {{from the use of}} zinc oxide in animal nutrition, considering the maximum contents for total zinc <b>in</b> <b>feedingstuffs</b> set by EU legislation. Zinc oxide is not an irritant to skin and eyes; it is not a skin sensitiser. The zinc oxide under application is considered a compound with high dusting potential, which may result in a critical exposure of users by inhalation, affecting the respiratory system. The authorised use of zinc oxide as a feed additive does not pose a direct concern for the agricultural soil compartment. However, there is a potential environmental concern related to groundwater, drainage and the run-off of zinc to surface water. Acid sandy soils are most vulnerable to these processes.

40|$|Within the EU, {{the use of}} {{nitrofurans}} {{is prohibited}} in food production animals. For this reason detection of these compounds <b>in</b> <b>feedingstuffs,</b> at whatever limit, constitutes an offence under EU legislation. This detection generally {{involves the use of}} analytical methods with limits of quantification lowers than 1  mg kg- 1. These procedures are unsuitable for the detection and confirmation of trace amounts of nitrofurans <b>in</b> <b>feedingstuffs</b> due to contamination. It is well known that very low concentrations of these compounds can be the source of residues of nitrofuran metabolites in meat and other edible products obtained from animals consuming the contaminated feed. The present multi-compound method was capable of measuring very low concentrations of nitrofurantoin (NFT), nitrofurazone (NFZ), furazolidone (FZD) and furaltadone (FTD) in animal feed using nifuroxazide (NXZ) as internal standard. Following ethyl acetate extraction at mild alkaline conditions and purification on NH 2 column, the nitrofurans are determined using liquid chromatography with photodiode-array detection (LC-DAD).

40|$|The European Union Reference Laboratory for the {{detection}} of animal proteins <b>in</b> <b>feedingstuffs</b> (EURL-AP) has developed an online micrographs collection supporting its network activities within the European Union for {{the detection}} of prohibited animal by-products in feed. So far, the only official method for detecting these by-products is light microscopy, which is highly dependent on the skills of a microscopist because it relies on particle recognition. In order to help the microscopist network to achieve high proficiency levels, it was necessary to create an online reference tool based on micrographs and accessible via an Intranet platform. Members of the National Reference Laboratories for animal proteins <b>in</b> <b>feedingstuffs</b> (NRL-AP) and the International Association for Feedingstuff Analysis – Section Feedingstuff Microscopy (IAG) have access to this micrographs collection.

40|$|The {{availability}} of robust methods for the species specific detection {{of meat and}} bone meal (MBM) <b>in</b> compound <b>feedingstuffs,</b> is an important prerequisite to enforce current and upcoming European legislation {{on the use of}} processed animal proteins in animal nutrition. Among possible methods, those based on DNA {{turned out to be a}} reliable tool for this aim, since DNA is a quite thermostable molecule able to resist severe heat treatments applied in the manufacturing of animal meals. The application of such methods by control laboratories implies that the method has been validated including an assessment of its robustness. Successful transferability between laboratories is considered an important robustness criterion of the method. However, corresponding guidelines regarding the design of such a study relevant to this field are missing. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of a new concept that was applied to check for the transferability of a qualitative assay for the detection of banned MBM <b>in</b> <b>feedingstuffs</b> at trace level based on real time PCR.

40|$|The {{legislation}} on environmental contaminants {{in food and}} feed chain is constantly evolving. Some of these contaminants, such as mycotoxins, have already {{been the subject of}} official control of the food and feed chain, while others, such as cyanotoxins compounds, are not yet covered. Present work is based on the development of innovative techniques aimed at the implementation of confirmatory analytical methods for the control of substances present and of probable future inclusion in the Official monitoring plans, i. e. aflatoxin M 1 in dairy products, T- 2 and HT- 2 toxins <b>in</b> <b>feedingstuffs</b> and microcystins and cylindrospermopsin in particular products such as dietary supplements. Regarding the mycotoxins, this work aims to focus on validation study of an analytical confirmatory method for the detection of T- 2 and HT- 2 toxins <b>in</b> <b>feedingstuffs,</b> as required by Commission Recommendation n 165 of 27 March 2013 with more rapid and reliable extraction methods based on QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe) extraction kit coupled to detection in LC-MS/MS. The applicability of QuEChERS extraction method was also tested for the analysis of AFM 1 in dairy products with final determination by LC-ESI-Ion Trap MS/MS. As to cyanotoxins, the Committee of Experts of the WHO defined a tolerable daily intake only for one of the up to 90 known microcystins, i. e. microcystin LR, although recent studies indicate that other congeners are eventually more toxic; here we present the development of a fully validated method for a rapid and reliable detection of these compounds in dietary supplements with ESI-Ion Trap MS/MS detection. So this work has allowed us to achieve several goals. Firstly, it has been provided an example, so far not present in the scientific literature, of application of the QuEChERS extraction analysis for a fully validated confirmatory method for T- 2 and HT- 2 determination <b>in</b> <b>feedingstuffs,</b> whose validity has been proved fullfilling European Legislation criteria requirements; moreover, for the confirmation of the presence of aflatoxin M 1 in dairy products in compliance with the needs of a quick response, an analytical solution to laboratories appointed for Official Control was provided. Moreover, the development and validation of analytical methods for substances such as microcystins characterized by toxicity and evident presence in dietary supplements, which are not covered by national and European legislation allowed us to provide guidance to the regulation both for performance criteria and for safety levels. The presence in dietary supplements of another cyanotoxin, the cylindrospermopsin was also evidenced...|$|R
40|$|The {{prohibition}} of using animal by-products <b>in</b> <b>feedingstuffs</b> depends on two factors: their nature {{defined by the}} tissue/cell type and the species of origin, and on their destination (pets, fur animals or other farmed animals). Proteomics is particularly well-suited {{to the purpose of}} PAPs detection as it is a tissue and species-specific method. The aim of this study was the identification and the selection of specific peptide biomarkers using tandem mass spectrometry for the detection of bovine blood products and blood meals in animal feed. Twenty-nine samples of blood meals and blood products (plasma or haemoglobin powder) of porcine, poultry and bovine origin as well as three milk products and two fish meals were analysed using a Q TOF mass spectrometer. Vegetal feed samples adulterated with 1 % or 10 % of bovine plasma powder, haemoglobin powder or blood meal were also analysed to evaluate the applicability of the method. Four proteins of interest were highlighted: Alpha- 2 -macroglobulin, apolipoprotein A- 1, serotransferrin and haemoglobin (α and β chains). From these proteins, sixteen peptides were identified as potential bovine blood biomarkers <b>in</b> <b>feedingstuffs.</b> Nine of them could be used for the detection of plasma powder and seven of them for haemoglobin powder or blood meal. The evaluation of these peptides by a search against NCBInr database revealed that some of them could also be used to detect other ruminant bloods such as ovine or caprine ones. These preliminary results are promising. Efforts are now focused to improve the protocol in order to increase the sensitivity of the method as regards the selected proteins. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} {{characteristics of a}} method based on HPLC with postcolumn derivatization and spectrophotometric detection for the quantification of semduramicin <b>in</b> poultry <b>feedingstuffs</b> have been determined via a collaborative study. Semduramicin is a feed additive that is authorized for fattening chickens within the European Union at a minimum and maximum content of 20 and 25 mg/kg <b>in</b> <b>feedingstuffs,</b> respectively. The target concentration of semduramicin in the test samples ranged from 11. 5 to 45. 0 mg/kg. The study has been conducted with {{two different types of}} test material, namely, feedingstuff samples that have been previously ground in our laboratory and pelleted <b>feedingstuffs.</b> <b>In</b> the latter case, the laboratories participating in the study had to grind the samples prior to analysis. The obtained RSD for repeatability (RSDr) ranged from 2 to 10 % for the ground materials, and from 2 and 7 % for the pelleted materials. The RSD for reproducibility (RSDR) varied between 11 and 16 % for the ground materials, and between 12 and 15 % for the pelleted materials. These data indicated that grinding as an additional step in the analytical procedure did not influence the precision profile of the method. In addition, the HorRat values for all test materials were below or equal to 1. 5, thus demonstrating that the obtained precision data were acceptable for the purpose of the method. Furthermore, an estimation of trueness based on statistical treatment of the results reported from the laboratories for spiked samples revealed acceptable mean recovery values of 88 ± 4 %. Based on the obtained performance profile, the method can be considered fully validated and transferable to control laboratories to be used within the framework of official control. JRC.
