500|$|Munro {{moved from}} Mississauga to Toronto after high school, to attend OCAD University. From {{early on in}} his career, his {{signature}} medium was pastiche work with men's underwear. The origins of this work date back to his Intro to Sculpture class at OCAD, where his professor asked the students to [...] "bring a special object to class that isn't really functional, but is special to you." [...] Munro had long had an affinity for special underwear, ever since his mother had refused to buy him Underoos superhero underwear {{when he was a}} child; regarding white briefs, he said, [...] "They were clinical and sterile. They weren't very sexy. It just felt very repressed. I wanted Underoos so bad." [...] For the sculpture class, Munro decided to bring in a pair of underwear that he had stolen from a high school friend on whom he had a crush. He put the grey underwear on display in a Plexiglass cage, complete with <b>air</b> <b>holes.</b> In his subsequent work he decided to use white briefs as a medium [...] "because they were so accessible." [...] The summer after his sculpture class, to keep himself busy on a road trip, he made a quilt out of white underwear. In 1997, his first show involving underwear was held in a gallery supported by his college. The show received publicity after conservative columnist Michael Coren, in the Toronto Sun and on the radio, criticized Munro and his show, in particular for having said that it involved [...] "boys' underwear" [...] (although Munro had simply meant guys' underwear). Coren asked the public to bring dirty diapers to the exhibit, but no one did. Munro went on to have many showings of his underwear art, mostly [...] "rescued" [...] from second-hand Goodwill clothing outlets, including at Who's Emma, HEADspace, and Paul Petro Contemporary Art. Actor Selma Blair bought one of Munro's underwear works when she was in town for the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival.|$|E
500|$|Two {{directors}} {{were assigned to}} the series – Ken Hannam and Christopher Barry. Hannam had previously directed such series as Colditz and Paul Temple while Barry had worked extensively on Doctor Who, having directed some 31 episodes at the time, including the stories The Dæmons and The Mutants for Letts and Dicks, as well as episodes of Out of the Unknown, Paul Temple and The Onedin Line. [...] Hannam and Barry alternated directing the episodes between them with filming on Moonbase 3 beginning on 24 April 1973 at the BBC film studios in Ealing. The Ealing filming mainly centred around the scenes set on the lunar surface which proved a difficult experience for the actors. Star Donald Houston told the Radio Times that the spacesuits got [...] "hot and claustrophobic. In the end they had to have oxygen standing by. [...] the dust rose in clouds and the cameramen all wore surgical masks. The actors just choked". [...] Recalling his guest appearance on Moonbase 3, in the episode [...] "Behemoth", Peter Miles told TV Zone in 1991 that he was [...] "asked to be like a gazelle and leap as I came down the hillock in full astronaut gear. [...] The tech crew wondered why I was steaming up furiously in my astronaut's head. They'd forgotten to put <b>air</b> <b>holes</b> into the helmet. [...] I said, 'Help help! Help help! I'm not breathing folks!' They took the helmet off before drilling the holes or I wouldn't be here now". [...] Filming continued at Ealing until 30 May 1973 before production moved to BBC Television Centre for the remaining scenes, mostly those set inside the moonbase, which would be recorded on videotape beginning on 18 June 1973. The episodes were recorded in a different order than that in which they were broadcast with [...] "Departure and Arrival" [...] recorded first followed by [...] "Castor and Pollux", [...] "Behemoth", [...] "View of a Dead Planet", [...] "Outsiders" [...] and, lastly, [...] "Achilles Heel" [...] with recording wrapping on 15 August 1973. [...] Music was provided by Dudley Simpson who, at this time, was the regular composer on Doctor Who. Simpson composed the main title theme that accompanied the opening and closing credits as well as approximately 60 minutes of incidental music.|$|E
2500|$|The {{elders of}} Israel used to precede them on {{foot to the}} Mount of Olives, {{where there was a}} place of immersion. The priest who was to burn the cow was {{deliberately}} made unclean in contravention of the teaching of the Sadducees, who taught that the cow needed to be slaughtered by one on whom the sun had set after cleansing from his impurity. They laid their hands upon the priest and said, [...] "My lord High Priest, immerse once." [...] He then immersed himself, came up, and dried himself. They laid out different kinds of wood there — cedar wood, pine, spruce, and the wood of smooth fig trees. They built up the pile of wood {{in the shape of a}} tower furnished with <b>air</b> <b>holes,</b> and they turned its foreside towards the west.|$|E

2500|$|Strict {{discipline}} {{and abuse of}} the prisoners increased at this time. Colonel Strong gave more power to patrols and put each barracks under control of a sergeant, two corporals and five privates. Some of these individuals were vindictive and even dangerous. On April 10, 1864, guards made some prisoners stand on barrels for purchasing whiskey from a guard. Others were made to wear signs noting various offenses. A new dungeon about [...] and [...] high, with two small <b>air</b> <b>holes,</b> was built in Prisoner's Square. Three men spent a night there for climbing a roof to watch horse racing. Punishment through extensive use of ball and chain, using a [...] cannonball chained to a prisoner's leg, began. Some prisoners received this punishment for reneging on a request to take the oath of allegiance to the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Beatings at Kemna, as {{at other}} early {{concentration}} camps, were frequent, {{beginning with the}} [...] "welcome beating" [...] on arrival at the camp right through to having to run a gauntlet when leaving. Because prisoners and guards were political opponents who were former neighbors and co-workers, punishment and torture at Kemna took on a personal nature. Prisoners were brought to interrogations naked and gagged with cloth stuffed in their mouths, were tied to special whipping benches, where they were whipped with rubber clubs, whips and sticks. Bleeding, they were then locked in a cubicle under the stairs, where they could neither sit nor stand and cigarette smoke was blown through the <b>air</b> <b>holes.</b> Beforehand, prisoners were made to eat [...] "appetizers" [...] of unsoaked salt herring smeared with lubricating grease or feces; when they regurgitated, {{they were forced to}} lick up the vomit. In November, prisoners with fresh wounds were thrown into the cold waters of the Wupper and afterwards, made to stay in their wet clothes. There were also simulated executions. According to one former SA paramedic, about 25 prisoners attempted suicide; others succeeded or simply died from the effects of the torture. Some survivors were crippled mentally or physically from their treatment, some {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E
2500|$|The first escape {{occurred}} in October 1943 in the East Compound. Conjuring up a modern Trojan Horse, kriegies (prisoners) constructed a gymnastic vaulting horse largely from plywood from Red Cross parcels. The horse {{was designed to}} conceal men, tools and containers of soil. Each day the horse was carried out to the same spot near the perimeter fence and while prisoners conducted gymnastic exercises above, a tunnel was dug. At {{the end of each}} working day, a wooden board was placed over the tunnel entrance and covered with surface soil. The gymnastics disguised the real purpose of the vaulting horse and kept the sound of the digging from being detected by the microphones. For three months three prisoners, Lieutenant Michael Codner, Flight Lieutenant Eric Williams and Flight Lieutenant Oliver Philpot, in shifts of one or two diggers at a time, dug over [...] of tunnel, using bowls as shovels and metal rods to poke through the surface of the ground to create <b>air</b> <b>holes.</b> No shoring was used except near the entrance. On the evening of 19 October 1943, Codner, Williams and Philpot made their escape. Williams and Codner were able to reach the port of Stettin where they stowed away on a Danish ship and eventually returned to Britain. Philpot, posing as a Norwegian margarine manufacturer, was able to board a train to Danzig (now Gdańsk) and from there stowed away on a Swedish ship headed for Stockholm, from where he was repatriated to Britain. Accounts of this escape were recorded in the book Goon in the Block (later retitled The Wooden Horse) by Williams, the book Stolen Journey by Philpot and the 1950 film The Wooden Horse.|$|E
40|$|Fused coupler forming with a {{single-mode}} fiber (SMF) and a photonic crystal fiber (PCF) {{is one of}} the solutions for optical coupling from a light source to a PCF. In this paper, we presented coupling characteristics of a fused fiber coupler formed with an ordinary SMF and a PCF having <b>air</b> <b>hole</b> collapsed taper. A prototype of SMF-PCF coupler with <b>air</b> <b>hole</b> collapsed taper was fabricated using CO 2 laser irradiation. The coupling efficiency from SMF to PCF was − 6. 2 [*]dB at 1554 [*]nm wavelength in the fabricated coupler. The structure of the SMF-PCF coupler to obtain high coupling efficiency was theoretically clarified by beam propagation analysis using an equivalent model of the coupler with simplification. It was clarified that appropriately choosing the prestretched or etched SMF diameter and the length of <b>air</b> <b>hole</b> collapsed region was effective to obtain high coupling efficiency that was a result of high extinction ratio at cross port and low excess loss. We also demonstrated that the diameter of prestretched SMF to obtain high coupling efficiency was insensitive to the <b>air</b> <b>hole</b> diameter ratio to pitch of the PCF in the <b>air</b> <b>hole</b> collapsed SMF-PCF coupler...|$|R

In {{order to examine}} the geometric effects on the turbulent combusting flow, several baffle configurations are selected. The interrelation between the flow structure and the thermal field are investigated by examing the variation of recirculation region, flame length and heat loss. For the flow mixing, the decreasing <b>air</b> <b>hole</b> is more efficient than the decrease of the fuel hole. As the fuel or <b>air</b> <b>hole</b> diameter decreases, combustion efficiency is enhanced and flame length is decreased. Additionally, as the diameter of <b>air</b> <b>hole</b> decreases, the heat loss and combustion temperature are increased, while they are reduced with decreasing the diameter of fuel hole...|$|R

40|$|A novel high {{birefringence}} {{and nearly}} zero dispersion-flattened photonic crystal fiber (PCF) with elliptical defected core (E-DC) and equilateral pentagonal architecture is designed. By applying the full-vector {{finite element method}} (FEM), the characteristics of electric field distribution, birefringence, and chromatic dispersion of the proposed E-DC PCF are numerically investigated in detail. The simulation results reveal that the proposed PCF can realize high birefringence, ranging from 10 - 3 to 10 - 2 orders of magnitude, owing to the embedded elliptical <b>air</b> <b>hole</b> in the core center. However, {{the existence of the}} elliptical <b>air</b> <b>hole</b> gives rise to an extraordinary electric field distribution, where a V-shaped notch appears {{and the size of the}} V-shaped notch varies at different operating wavelengths. Also, the mode field diameter is estimated to be about 2 [*]μm, which implies the small effective mode area and highly nonlinear coefficient. Furthermore, the investigation of the chromatic dispersion characteristic shows that the introduction of the elliptical <b>air</b> <b>hole</b> is helpful to control the chromatic dispersion to be negative or nearly zero flattened over a wide wavelength bandwidth...|$|R
