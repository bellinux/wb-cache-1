40|$|The {{principle}} of Inductive Power Transfer (IPT) is very old {{but it is}} rarely used for transferring power from source to load via a medium. This is because normally the medium restricts the power transfer due to losses or the shielding effects. However, for low energy applications, an acceptable amount of power could be transferred from the source to the load. This paper aims at finding the amount of power transferred, the losses and efficiency for a given configuration. First, an <b>analytical</b> <b>model</b> is constructed. This <b>analytical</b> <b>model</b> involves equations governing the mechanism of IPT. Second, the paper deals with experimental validation of the derived <b>analytical</b> <b>model.</b> A set up {{was made in the}} laboratory and certain experiments were performed for the comparison with <b>analytical</b> <b>model.</b> Experiments performed at different frequencies validated the <b>analytical</b> <b>model</b> but with few discrepancies, which are due to the assumptions made in the <b>analytical</b> <b>model.</b> Electrical Power ProcessingElectrical Power EngineeringElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R

50|$|The term {{load testing}} {{is used in}} {{different}} ways in the professional software testing community. Load testing generally refers {{to the practice of}} modeling the expected usage of a software program by simulating multiple users accessing the program concurrently. As such, this testing is most relevant for multi-user systems; often one built using a client/server model, such as web servers. However, other types of software systems can also be load tested. For example, a word processor or graphics editor can be forced to read an extremely large document; or a financial package can be forced to generate a report based on several years' worth of data. The most accurate load testing simulates actual use, as opposed to testing using theoretical or <b>analytical</b> <b>modeling.</b>|$|E

5000|$|... 1D system simulation, also {{referred}} to as 1D CAE or mechatronics system simulation, allows scalable modeling of multi-domain systems. The full system is presented in a schematic way, by connecting validated <b>analytical</b> <b>modeling</b> blocks of electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic and mechanical subsystems (including control systems). It helps engineers predict the behavior of concept designs of complex mechatronics, either transient or steady-state. Manufacturers often have validated libraries available that contain predefined components for different physical domains. Or if not, specialized software suppliers can provide them. Using those, the engineers can do concept predictions very early, even before any Computer-aided Design (CAD) geometry is available. During later stages, parameters can then be adapted.1D system simulation calculations are very efficient. The components are analytically defined, and have input and output ports. Causality is created by connecting inputs of a components to outputs of another one (and vice versa). Models can have various degrees of complexity, and can reach very high accuracy as they evolve. Some model versions may allow real-time simulation, which is particularly useful during control systems development or as part of built-in predictive functionality.|$|E
5000|$|Designing {{the process}} {{has in the past}} been a {{challenging}} task, since initial <b>analytical</b> <b>modeling</b> is possible only for limited cases. Advances in FEA and FEM in recent years has enabled hydroform processes to be more widely engineered for varieties of parts and materials. Often FEM simulations must be performed in order to find a feasible process solution and to define the correct loading curves: pressure vs. time and axial feed vs. time. In the case of more complex tube hydroformed parts the tube must be pre-bent prior to loading into the hydroforming die. Bending is done sequentially {{along the length of the}} tube, with the tube being bent around bending discs (or dies) as the tube length is fed in. Bending can be done with or without mandrels. This additional complexity of process further increases the reliance on FEM for designing and evaluating manufacturing processes. The feasibility of a hydroforming process must take into consideration the initial tube material properties and its potential for variation, along with the bending process, hydraulic pressure throughout the forming process, in inclusion of axial feed or not, in order to predict metal formability.|$|E
5000|$|For {{hitting a}} distant target an {{appropriate}} positive elevation angle is required that {{is achieved by}} angling the line of sight from the shooter's eye through the centerline of the sighting system downward toward the line of departure. This {{can be accomplished by}} simply adjusting the sights down mechanically, or by securing the entire sighting system to a sloped mounting having a known downward slope, or by a combination of both. This procedure has the effect of elevating the muzzle when the barrel must be subsequently raised to align the sights with the target. A projectile leaving a muzzle at a given elevation angle follows a ballistic trajectory whose characteristics are dependent upon various factors such as muzzle velocity, gravity, and aerodynamic drag. This ballistic trajectory {{is referred to as the}} bullet path. If the projectile is spin stabilized, aerodynamic forces will also predictably arc the trajectory slightly to the right, if the rifling employs [...] "right-hand twist." [...] Some barrels are cut with left-hand twist, and the bullet will arc to the left, as a result. Therefore, to compensate for this path deviation, the sights also have to be adjusted left or right, respectively. A constant wind also predictably affects the bullet path, pushing it slightly left or right, and a little bit more up and down, depending on the wind direction. The magnitude of these deviations are also affected by whether the bullet is on the upward or downward slope of the trajectory, due to a phenomenon called [...] "yaw of repose," [...] where a spinning bullet tends to steadily and predictably align slightly off center from its point mass trajectory. Nevertheless, each of these trajectory perturbations are predictable once the projectile aerodynamic coefficients are established, through a combination of detailed <b>analytical</b> <b>modeling</b> and test range measurements.|$|E
