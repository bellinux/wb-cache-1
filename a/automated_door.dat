5000|$|Set in a 1980s {{technological}} future, {{the video}} opens {{with the band}} walking into a theater hall through an <b>automated</b> <b>door.</b> A RoboCop-like figure points, saying [...] "sign in please", a direct reference to the album on which the song appears. In an occurrence of product placement, a ray of light reveals a PaperMate Sharpwriter mechanical pencil, which had been released earlier that year. Using the pencil, the band members provide their signatures next to their names (listed along with their respective musical instruments) on a paper during which the pencil's name is prominently featured. Drummer Keni Richards writes an X, which sets off an error alarm; Keni then erases it and signs properly. The band is then seen performing the song to a crowd. The video ends with Autograph boarding a limousine resembling a DeLorean DMC-12 by its gull wing doors. Lead vocalist Steve Plunkett throws the pencil {{to one of the}} female fans before leaving. The cyborg hand at the steering wheel {{turns out to be the}} robot from the start of the video, and the final shot reveals the robot's head as the door closes.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research {{was to develop a}} fully automated vehicle car door that can detect any object obstructing its path during operation. A fully <b>automated</b> <b>door</b> concept has not yet been implemented in the car industry. The door, operated via a pull of the door handle, utilizes an IR sensor to detect objects in its path. The vehicle door utilizes a linear direct current (DC) actuator with a built in potentiometer to power and control the vehicle door. The built in potentiometer provides feedback to the system. Proportional integral (PI) control was implemented to the system in order to provide a smoother and safer operation. The rise time of the system is 0. 77 seconds and settling time is 1. 07 seconds. The operation time is 3 seconds for the door to either open or close. The <b>automated</b> <b>door</b> has greater benefits compared to a manually operated door, such as ensuring greater safety in door operation and enhancing the lifetime as the door will not be slammed during its cycle. In addition, the door will provide more convenience to physically challenged people, as {{they will be able to}} open and close the door with the push of a button...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{public places}} {{sanitary}} conditions are always of concern, particular-ly of surfaces that are touched by {{a multitude of}} persons, such as door handles in rest rooms. Similar issues also arise in medical facilities. Doors that open based on presence are common in environments such as shopping malls; how-ever they are not suited for sensitive areas, such as toilet stalls. Capacitive prox-imity sensors detect {{the presence of the}} human body over a distance and can be unobtrusively applied in order to enable hidden gesture-based interfaces that work without touch. In this paper we present a concept for a gesture controlled <b>automated</b> <b>door</b> based on this sensor technology. We introduce the underlying technology and present the concept and electronic components used in detail. Novel interaction patterns and data processing methods allow to open, close, lock and unlock the door using simple gestures. A prototype device has been created and evaluated in a user study...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} design-ing a generic framework for distributed coordination and control in multiagent systems. Communication between agents increase their effectiveness, which is why this {{is the cornerstone of}} the software framework. Generic aspects are secured by making all layers of the software framework exchangeable, which secures compatibility with different wireless topologies, protocols and applications. A protocol for multiagent systems and an application regarding dis-tributed household cleaning is designed. The parts of the design concerning task assignment and peripheral units is implemented on the designed software framework. The results show {{that it is possible to}} implement applications on the designed software framework. The designed task assignment algorithm is able to distribute tasks between multiple agents in a hierarchical manner by means of the protocol. Furthermore it is possible to interact with peripheral units in the form of a Ubisense localisation system and an <b>automated</b> <b>door</b> from Besam. The tests of the protocol show that optimizations regarding collision avoidance are needed in order to make the protocol usable. The designed algorithm for cooperative completion of tasks is verified by means of UPPAAL. From this it is concluded that all states of the algorithm are reachable and it contains no deadlocks.

40|$|A {{digital access}} control system allows users to access a premise using an access card. It is {{introduced}} as an alternative system to the most common {{access control system}} using physical keys and mechanical locks to increase the level of convenience to access a premise. However, an intruder is able {{to gain access to}} the premise if he/she possesses the access card or the physical keys. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an access control system that utilizes near field communication (NFC) smartphone and information hiding technique to overcome the disadvantage mentioned previously on the existing systems. The first protection level is NFC smartphone and NFC reader or tag to initiate the access control to the premise. The second protection level is the information hiding technique to embed access passcode into the user's photo to obtain an encoded photo, which is also known as stego-photo. The access passcode in the stego-photo is later extracted using information hiding technique during the door access stage for verification of the legitimate user. An <b>automated</b> <b>door</b> is developed and NFC reader or tag is located near the door. The interaction between NFC smartphone and NFC reader or tag enables prompting of the correct stego-photo to be selected using the smartphone to perform the user authentication process. The door is unlocked if the access passcode extracted from the stego-photo matches with the access passcode in the database located at the server. If otherwise, alarm is triggered and a light emitting diode (LED) is turned on. The lighted LED acts as an indicator to give an alert to the user that someone has tried to break into his/her house when he/she is not around...|$|E

50|$|According to Strabo, a water powered mill {{was built}} in Kaberia {{of the kingdom of}} Mithridates during the 1st century BC. Use of water wheels in mills spread {{throughout}} the Roman Empire over the next few centuries. Some were quite complex, with aqueducts, dams, and sluices to maintain and channel the water, along with systems of gears, or toothed-wheels made of wood and metal to regulate the speed of rotation. More sophisticated small devices, such as the Antikythera Mechanism used complex trains of gears and dials to act as calendars or predict astronomical events. In a poem by Ausonius in the 4th century AD, he mentions a stone-cutting saw powered by water. Hero of Alexandria is credited with many such wind and steam powered machines in the 1st century AD, including the Aeolipile and the vending machine, often these machines were associated with worship, such as animated altars and <b>automated</b> temple <b>doors.</b>|$|R
