The samples {{were prepared for}} alternate multilayer structures, which were <b>annealed</b> in different <b>conditions.</b> The capacitance-voltage (C-V) measuring {{results indicate that the}} VFB of samples shift negatively for thinner bottom Al 2 O 3 layer, increasing annealing temperature or longer annealing duration.

40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) {{is a form}} {{of solid}} state welding which has {{generated}} interest in the manufacturing sector since its inception in 1991. This technology has particular benefits when working with heat treatable aluminium alloys which are vulnerable to weld defects when joined using conventional fusion welding techniques including weld cracking and softening across the joint. Typically welding is conducted with material in an age hardened condition, however despite the lower temperatures involved in friction stir welding it has been found that mechanical properties are degraded when joining aluminium alloys in the 2 XXX, 6 XXX and 7 XXX alloy series. It is highly desirable that these alloys be joined in a manner which achieves the peak mechanical properties of the material across the weld joint. It has been suggested that welding 2 XXX, 6 XXX and 7 XXX series aluminium alloys while in the soft, <b>annealed</b> <b>condition</b> can be beneficial in terms of manufacturing and help to reduce the requirements for friction stir welding. Applying heat treatments to the joint post welding can then be used to restore the mechanical properties. However it has been found that significant grain coarsening occurs in the weld joint after post weld heat treatment which has negative consequences for the joint’s performance. This investigation explored the use of pre weld heat treatment of FSW aluminium alloys by welding AA 6061 in a solution treated condition and subjecting the specimens to artificial ageing. The hardness and microstructure of the joints was then compared with specimens that were produced in AA 6061 in the <b>annealed</b> <b>condition</b> which had been subjected to a standard post weld heat treatment in order to compare the difference and similarities between the two welding procedures. The results of this work suggest that it is more beneficial to weld in the <b>annealed</b> <b>condition</b> with respect to hardness. After ageing the specimens welded in the solution treated condition showed signs of over-ageing, while the specimens welded in the <b>annealed</b> <b>condition</b> exhibited high, uniform hardness across the weld joint. However in terms of the grain structure it was found that welding specimens in the solution treated condition and then ageing was beneficial. It was found that the fine grain structure that formed in the nugget zone was retained after ageing, opposed to the significant grain coarsening seen in the specimens that were welded in the <b>annealed</b> <b>condition</b> and post weld heat treated...|$|E

40|$|International audienceMicrostructural {{modifications}} {{induced by}} welding of 316 stainless steels and {{their effect on}} creep properties and relaxation crack propagation were examined. Cumulative strain due to multi-pass welding hardens the materials by increasing the dislocation density. Creep tests were conducted on three plates from different grades of 316 steel at 600 °C, with various carbon and nitrogen contents. These plates were tested both in the <b>annealed</b> <b>condition</b> and after warm rolling, which introduced pre-strain.

These results confirmed that the reheat cracking risk increases with both residual stress triaxiality and pre-strain. On the contrary, high solute content and strain-induced carbide precipitation, which are thought to increase reheat cracking risk of stabilised austenitic stainless steels did not appear as key parameters in reheat cracking of 316 stainless steels...|$|E
