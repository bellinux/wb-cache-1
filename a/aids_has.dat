5|$|In 2016 about 36.7 {{million people}} were living with HIV and it {{resulted}} in 1 million deaths. There were 300,000 fewer new HIV cases in 2016 than in 2015. Most of those infected live in sub-Saharan Africa. Between its discovery and 2014 <b>AIDS</b> <b>has</b> caused an estimated 39million deaths worldwide. HIV/AIDS is considered a pandemic—a disease outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading. HIV {{is believed to have}} originated in west-central Africa during the late 19th or early 20th century. AIDS was first recognized by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1981 and its cause—HIV infection—was identified {{in the early part of}} the decade.|$|E
5|$|Most {{researchers}} believe that HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century; {{it is now a}} pandemic, with an estimated 38.6million people now living with the disease worldwide. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) estimate that <b>AIDS</b> <b>has</b> killed more than 25million people since it was first recognised on 5 June 1981, {{making it one of the}} most destructive epidemics in recorded history. In 2007 there were 2.7million new HIV infections and 2million HIV-related deaths.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} <b>AIDS</b> <b>has</b> {{been linked to}} a virus known to infect more than 40 species of nonhuman {{primates}} in Africa. HIV-1, is composed of four phylogenetic lineages, which {{at some point in}} time have independently gone through cross-species transmission of the SIV (simian immune-deficiency virus). The simian immunodeficiency virus infected various African primates such as apes, gorillas and chimpanzees.|$|E
40|$|The paper explores {{a number}} of long {{standing}} questions surrounding how foreign <b>aid</b> <b>has</b> influenced the fiscal behaviour of the PNG Government. This includes whether grant <b>aid</b> <b>has</b> encouraged the PNG government to be less fiscally responsible and accumulate higher levels of foreign debt; whether grant <b>aid</b> <b>has</b> tended to lower the PNG government's domestic revenue raising efforts; whether grant <b>aid</b> <b>has</b> drawn government expenditures away from key service delivery sectors; and whether budget support and project and program <b>aid</b> <b>have</b> had differential effects with respect {{to any of the}} foregoing questions. The analysis reveals several important insights regarding the interplay between foreign aid and public sector fiscal behaviour including evidence that grant <b>aid</b> <b>has</b> been an important source of debt reduction during this period. However, grant <b>aid</b> <b>has</b> tended to erode the domestic tax base, which has limited the government's ability to increase aggregate expenditure levels. Evidence is also found that suggests a significant portion of budget support was spent on key development sectors, although it also undermined domestic revenue collection. A number of policy implications follow. Copyright © 2010 The Author.

The average yearly increase in opioid-related deaths from 1990 to 2002 was nearly three times the yearly increase from 1979–90, with the greatest increase in 2000–02, yet AIDS cases and deaths fell dramatically during the mid-to-late-1990s. Duesberg's claim that recreational drug use, rather than HIV, {{was the cause of}} <b>AIDS</b> <b>has</b> been specifically examined and found to be false. Cohort studies have found that only HIV-positive drug users develop opportunistic infections; HIV-negative drug users do not develop such infections, indicating that HIV rather than drug use is the cause of AIDS.|$|E

50|$|<b>Aid</b> flows <b>have</b> {{significantly}} {{increased over the}} last decade, {{but at the same}} time <b>aid</b> <b>has</b> become increasingly fragmented.

2500|$|The {{outbreak}} of <b>AIDS</b> <b>has</b> {{given a new}} sense of urgency to sex education. In many African countries, where AIDS is at epidemic levels (see HIV/AIDS in Africa), sex education is seen by most scientists as a vital public health strategy.

Whether Robert Gallo or Luc Montagnier deserved more credit for {{the discovery of the}} virus that causes <b>AIDS</b> <b>has</b> been a matter of considerable controversy. As it was, Gallo was left out and not awarded a prize. Additionally, there was scandal when it was learned that Harald zur Hausen was being investigated for having a financial interest in vaccines for the cervical cancer that HPV can cause. AstraZeneca, who with a stake in two lucrative HPV vaccines could benefit financially from the prize, had agreed to sponsor Nobel Media and Nobel Web. According to Times Online, two senior figures in the selection process that chose zur Hausen also had strong links with AstraZeneca.|$|E
60|$|Here, then, in {{the advance}} of natural-history-classification, are two {{fundamental}} facts, which should be borne in mind when classifying the emotions. If, as Mr. Bain rightly assumes, the emotions are to be grouped after the natural-history-method; then {{it should be the}} natural-history-method in its complete form, and not in its rude form. Mr. Bain will doubtless agree in the belief, that a correct account of the emotions in their natures and relations, must correspond with a correct account of the nervous system--must form another side of the same ultimate facts. Structure and function must necessarily harmonize. Structures which have with each other certain ultimate connexions, must have functions which have answering connexions. Structures which have arisen in certain ways, must have functions which have arisen in parallel ways. And hence if analysis and development are needful for the right interpretation of structures, they must be needful for the right interpretation of functions. Just as a scientific description of the digestive organs must include not only their obvious forms and connexions, but their microscopic characters, and also {{the ways in which they}} severally result by differentiation from the primitive mucous membrane; so must a scientific account of the nervous system include its general arrangements, its minute structure, and its mode of evolution; and so must a scientific account of nervous actions include the answering three elements. Alike in classing separate organisms, and in classing the parts of the same organism, the complete natural-history-method involves ultimate analysis, aided by development; and Mr. Bain, in not basing his classification of the emotions on characters reached through these <b>aids,</b> <b>has</b> fallen short of the conception with which he set out.|$|E
