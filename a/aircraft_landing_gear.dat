25|$|Currently Mexico is {{focusing}} in developing an aerospace {{industry and the}} assembly of helicopter and regional jet aircraft fuselages is taking place. Foreign firms such as MD Helicopters, Bell, Cessna and Bombardier build helicopter, aircraft and regional jets fuselages in Mexico. Although the Mexican aircraft industry is mostly foreign, as is its car industry, Mexican firms have been founded such as Aeromarmi, which builds light propeller airplanes, and Hydra Technologies, which builds Unmanned Aerial Vehicles such as the S4 Ehécatl, other important companies are Frisa Aerospace that manufactures jet engine parts for the new Mitsubishi Regional jet and supplies Prat and rolls Royce jet engine manufacturers of casings for jet engines and Kuo Aerospace that builds parts for <b>aircraft</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> and Supplies bombardier plant in Querétaro.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970 Menasco, a {{corporation}} with manufacturing plants in Burbank, California, and Fort Worth, Texas, purchased two California plants from Howmet Corporation, in Montebello and Pomona, both in California, taking over Howmet's contracts and manufacturing {{operations for the}} production of <b>aircraft</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> [...] Because the Montebello plant was operating at a substantial loss, Menasco closed the plant.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning about 1946 {{landing gear}} {{manufacturing}} shifted to include commercial airliners. [...] By {{the end of}} the 1990s Menasco Aerosystems was the free world's largest producer of <b>aircraft</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear,</b> with plants in California, Texas and Canada. [...] A few of the aircraft that gear sets were made for include the A7, F102, C130, C141, the Space Shuttle, F16, F16E, F18, F18E, YF22, B-1, C5A, C5B, B52, and tip gear for the B36. Gear sets for Boeing include the 707, 727, 737, 757, 777 and the KC135. Gear sets were also made for the Lockheed L-1011, [...] Boeing, Douglas, Convair, Martin, McDonnel, Republic, North American and other aircraft manufacturers.|$|E

The tasks of <b>aircraft</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> are complex and lead to a number of sometimes-contradictory requirements.

2500|$|The {{tailhook}} is {{a strong}} metal bar, with its free end flattened out, thickened somewhat, and fashioned into a claw-like hook. [...] The hook is mounted on a swivel on the keel of the aircraft, and is normally mechanically and hydraulically held in the stowed/up position. [...] Upon actuation by the pilot, hydraulic or pneumatic pressure lowers the hook to the down position. [...] The presence of a tailhook is not evidence of an aircraft's aircraft carrier suitability. [...] Carrier aircraft hooks {{are designed to be}} quickly raised by the pilot after use. [...] Many land-based fighters also have tailhooks for use in case of a brake/tire malfunctions, aborted takeoffs, or other emergencies. [...] Land-based <b>aircraft</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> and tailhooks are typically not strong enough to absorb the impact of a carrier landing, and some land-based tailhooks are held down with nitrogen pressure systems that must be recharged by ground personnel after actuation.|$|E
