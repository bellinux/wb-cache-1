5|$|Private {{associations}} and country clubs have no obvious public law function, yet the courts exercise judicial review over their decisions and proceedings, such as hearings relating to disciplinary matters and those held {{to decide if}} persons should be deprived of their memberships in the associations, {{to ensure that they}} <b>are</b> <b>fair</b> and comply with the requirements of natural justice. It has been suggested that the courts' jurisdiction in such matters depends on contract. The rules of an association form a contract between the members of the association themselves, and the need for hearings to be conducted in accordance with natural justice is an implied term in the contract. Accordingly, the courts are merely enforcing the contract rather than exercising a judicial review function.|$|E
5|$|The Silkie (sometimes spelled Silky) is a {{breed of}} chicken {{named for its}} atypically fluffy plumage, which is said to feel like silk, and satin. The breed has several other unusual qualities, such as black skin and bones, blue earlobes, and five toes on each foot, whereas most {{chickens}} only have four. They are often exhibited in poultry shows, and appear in various colors. In addition to their distinctive physical characteristics, Silkies are well known for their calm, friendly temperament. It {{is among the most}} docile of poultry. Hens are also exceptionally broody, and care for young well. Though they <b>are</b> <b>fair</b> layers themselves, laying only about three eggs a week, they are commonly used to hatch eggs from other breeds and bird species due to their broody nature. Silkie chickens are very easy to keep as pets. They are suitable for children, as they can easily withstand being roughly handled.|$|E

25|$|Because {{each cell}} of a sannin shogi board is a hexagon {{rather than a}} {{rectangle}} as in other shogi variants, the pieces will necessarily move differently.

25|$|In September 2005, Intel filed a {{response}} to an , disputing AMD's claims, and claiming that Intel's business practices <b>are</b> <b>fair</b> and lawful. In a rebuttal, Intel deconstructed AMD's offensive strategy and argued that AMD struggled {{largely as a result}} of its own bad business decisions, including underinvestment in essential manufacturing capacity and excessive reliance on contracting out chip foundries. Legal analysts predicted the lawsuit would drag on for a number of years since Intel's initial response indicated its unwillingness to settle with AMD. In 2008 a court date was finally set, but in 2009, Intel settled with a $1.25billion payout to AMD (see below).|$|E
25|$|Regarded {{as one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} human rights, the courts have stated that there is no difference between the protection offered by the common law, and that guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights. The right to freedom of expression has traditionally been considered as residual in character but certain types of speech are protected in positive terms. This is the case of debates in Parliament which are protected by parliamentary privilege, media reporting on parliamentary proceedings is covered by absolute privilege, while reports of court proceedings are protected by qualified privilege so long as they <b>are</b> <b>fair,</b> accurate and not published with malice.|$|E
25|$|The Assassinate mode {{is similar}} to Wanted, but instead of target {{contracts}} being assigned to players, all players <b>are</b> <b>fair</b> game. Players must identify other player characters and lock on before assassinating. Because two players can kill each other, whoever locks on first becomes the hunter and the other becomes the target. The standard compass found in Wanted is replaced by directional arrows based on proximity, that grow to become arcs {{around the perimeter of}} the compass as other players near, and will eventually create a full circle when other players are very close. As in other modes, the player with the highest score at the end of the session is the winner.|$|E

However, courts have occasionally found use of an entire work to <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> use, and in other contexts, using even a small amount of a copyrighted work was determined not to <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> use because the selection was an important part—or the “heart”—of the work.|$|R

25|$|Happily, Gossaert {{was capable}} of higher efforts. His St Luke {{painting}} the portrait of the Virgin in Sanct Veit at Prague, a variety of the same subject in the Belvedere at Vienna, the Madonna of the Baring collection in London, or the numerous repetitions of Christ and the scoffers (Ghent and Antwerp), all prove that travel had left many of Gossaert's fundamental peculiarities unaltered. His figures still retain the character of stone; his architecture is as rich and varied, his tones are as strong as ever. But bright contrasts of gaudy tints are replaced by soberer greys; and a cold haze, the sfumato of the Milanese, pervades the surfaces. It is but seldom that these features fail to obtrude. When they least show, the master displays a brilliant palette combined with smooth surface and incisive outlines. In this form the Madonnas of Munich and Vienna (1527), the likeness of a girl weighing gold pieces (Berlin), and the portraits {{of the children of}} the king of Denmark at Hampton Court, <b>are</b> <b>fair</b> specimens of his skill.|$|E
500|$|In {{comparison}} with The Final Cut, Gilmour presented A Momentary Lapse as {{a return to}} the Floyd of older days, citing his belief that towards the end of Waters' tenure, lyrics were more important than music. Gilmour said: [...] "The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here were so successful not just because of Roger's contributions, but also because there was a better balance between the music and the lyrics [...] " [...] He added that with A Momentary Lapse, he had tried to restore this earlier, more successful balance. Waters was scathing in his assessment of the new work, a view with which Wright later partly agreed, saying: [...] "Roger's criticisms <b>are</b> <b>fair.</b> It's not a band album at all." ...|$|E
500|$|A Momentary Lapse of Reason was {{released}} in September 1987. Storm Thorgerson, whose creative input was absent from The Wall and The Final Cut, designed the album cover. To drive home the point that Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the inside cover, the first since Meddle. The album went straight to number three in the UK and the US. Waters commented: [...] "I think it's facile, but a quite clever forgery... The songs are poor in general... Gilmour's lyrics are third-rate." [...] Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as {{a return to the}} band's top form, Wright disagreed, stating: [...] "Roger's criticisms <b>are</b> <b>fair.</b> It's not a band album at all." [...] Q Magazine described the album as essentially a Gilmour solo effort.|$|E

[...] Nick Levine from Digital Spy selected the song as the album's best track by writing [...] "Truth be told, this album lacks an absolute classic to match 'Confide in Me', but 'Breathe' – subtle but sneakily catchy with it – could be one of 's most underrated singles." [...] While reviewing Minogue's 2004 compilation, Ultimate Kylie, Jaime Gill from Yahoo! Music gave it a mixed review by writing [...] "Beginning in 1994 with the gorgeously glacial, slinkily synthetic 'Confide In Me', Kylie enjoyed brief success before fans fled in droves from awkward faux-rock like 'Some Kind of Bliss' (not included) and flimsy house like 'Breathe'." [...] Reviewing her 2002 compilation, Hits+, Mackenzie Wilson from AllMusic commended Minogue's [...] "seductive vocals" [...] on [...] "Breathe", [...] "Automatic Love" [...] and [...] "Confide in Me".|$|E
