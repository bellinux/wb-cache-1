40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether it is possible to detect high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings in aluminium powder workers, which are consistent with early stages of <b>aluminosis.</b> 62 male workers from 8 departments of two plants producing aluminium (Al) powder were investigated using a standardized questionnaire, physical examination, lung function analysis, biological monitoring of Al in plasma and urine, chest X-ray, HRCT and immunological tests. Chronic bronchitis was observed in 15 (24. 2 %) of the workers, and four workers (6. 5 %) reported shortness of breath during exercise. HRCT findings in 15 workers (24. 2 %) were characterized by ill-defined centrilobular nodular opacities. Workers with ill-defined centrilobular nodular opacities had a lower vital capacity than workers who had no such HRCT-findings (90. 9 % pred. vs. 101. 8 % pred., p = 0. 01). Biological monitoring in plasma and urine revealed higher internal exposure to Al in affected workers (33. 5 μg/l plasma to 15. 4 μg/l plasma, p = 0. 01) and (340. 5 μg/g creat. to 135. 1 μg/g creat., p = 0. 007). Years of exposure and concentration of aluminum in urine and plasma appear to be the best predictors for HRCT findings. Age and decreased vital capacity show borderline significance. We conclude that <b>aluminosis</b> is still relevant in occupational medicine. With HRCT it is possible to detect early stages of <b>aluminosis</b> and biological monitoring can be used to define workers at high risk. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The authors {{present a}} case of {{occupational}} lung damage from exposure to dust containing aluminium. The first detected objective pathological finding was that of dispersed micronodules in the lungs seen in a chest radiograph. The final diagnosis of pulmonary <b>aluminosis</b> was established {{after three years of}} gradual exclusion of other interstitial lung diseases. The diagnosis was sup-ported by the occupational history confirmed by hygiene assessment of the patient’s workplace and especially by histological examination with elemental analysis of the lung tissue. The possibility of development of this rare condition should not be underestimated in workers at high-risk jobs...|$|E
30|$|Uptake of {{aluminum}} {{can result in}} risks to human health. Aluminum {{has an effect on}} numerous biological processes in the body. The exact mechanism {{of aluminum}} toxicity is, however, not fully understood. It is considered certain that aluminum is potentially cell- and neurotoxic. [22]. Enzyme activity may be disrupted and mitochondrial function may be impaired. Aluminum may also produce oxidative stress [4]. In particular, three organ systems may be negatively affected by aluminum: the hemopoietic system, the nervous system and bones. It has also been suggested that aluminum {{may play a role in}} the occurrence of diseases such as breast cancer and Alzheimer’s dementia [22]. The only direct connections that have been shown between aluminum and disease are for hemodialysis encephalopathy, osteomalacia (softening of the bones), anemia, and <b>aluminosis</b> (pathological changes to the lungs) [22, 28]. Of particular importance are aluminum poisoning in the form of encephalopathy and osteomalacia. These effects may occur in patients with chronic kidney disease who are dependent upon dialysis or ingest phosphate binders containing aluminum for extended periods of time [29]. Dialysis encephalopathy 2 has been brought into connection with increased aluminum concentrations in the brain of dialysis patients. In order to adequately remove phosphate from the blood, the dialysis fluid contains an aluminum compound. The aluminum can then apparently accumulate in the body and in the brain. Patients may suffer from speech difficulties and muscle cramps brought on especially by trivalent aluminum ions, personality changes, accelerated dementia, and depressive moods [30, 31]. The skeletal system has also been suggested as a potential target of aluminum toxicity [28]. Long-term uptake of comparatively large amounts of aluminum, e.g., taking antacids 3 containing aluminum, may cause an imbalance in the calcium and phosphate household with resultant softening of the bones [32]. Substantial aluminum contamination may result in delayed bone development [31] and development of anemia. Aluminum-induced anemia is typically macrocytic and hypochromatic, 4 often occurring in dialysis patients. The exact cause of this phenomenon remains unknown [31]. <b>Aluminosis,</b> also referred to as “aluminum lung” is an occupational disease of workers exposed to aluminum and aluminum oxide dust and vapors. Of all aluminum-related health risks, <b>aluminosis</b> has been known the longest. [29]. Aluminum compounds accumulate in the lungs and impair the self-cleaning system of the lungs. In addition, they may elicit inflammatory processes that induce irreversible tissue damage to the respiratory system and the lungs, possibly resulting in fibrosis [33, 34]. Due to inadequate and disputable data, the involvement of aluminum in breast cancer and the development of Alzheimer’s disease as mentioned in the discussion can neither be explicitly substantiated or negated. Indications of a relationship between aluminum and breast cancer result from observations that breast tissue of women with tumors to some extent may exhibit higher aluminum concentrations than tissue from healthy women. It should also be noted that the disproportionate incidence of female breast cancer in the upper outer quadrant rises with year of publication, from 30.9 % in 1926 to 43 – 48 % in 1947 – 1967 and to 60.7 % in 1994 [35]. Aside from the improved diagnostic methods for cancer of the breast, the use of antitranspirants or deodorants containing aluminum may also play a role. Since these substances are applied very close to the breast tissue, they could be involved in the development of breast cancer [9]. It must be noted, however, that the data related to this are contradictory and as a consequence it is not possible to draw scientifically tenable conclusions regarding antitranspirants or deodorants containing aluminum and breast cancer. As a reaction to this controversial situation, however, aluminum-free antitranspirants have begun to appear in the market. Alzheimer’s disease is an illness characterized by disorders in cognitive areas such as memory and orientation disturbances [36]. Reports have been made of increased aluminum concentrations in certain areas of the brain [37]. As with the role that aluminum may play in the development of breast cancer, the role of aluminum in Alzheimer’s disease remains very controversial. As possible mechanism, the neurotoxic potential of aluminum and the possibility that aluminum bound to transferrin may enter the brain have been suggested. There is no evidence that aluminum may be a singular causative factor for Alzheimer’s disease, but may act as a co-factor that can abet the development of the disease [22].|$|E
40|$|The {{problems}} {{encountered in}} diagnosing the rare types of pneumoconiosis (silicatosis other than asbestosis, <b>aluminosis</b> and hard metals fibrosis), {{result from the}} difficulties in realising a good occupational anamnese and from the disease pattern by itself. The classical examinations, (X-rays of the thorax and lung function measurements), {{are not able to}} detect the cause of these diseases, which are fundamentally characterised by an absence of specificity. These last years, new methods of diagnoses (angiotensin converting enzyme, gallium scan, transbronchial biopsies, mineralogical, cytological and histological examinations of the lung tissues and of the bronchial alveolar lavage) were developed and progressively introduced in the daily practice in pneumology. Only the examination of lung biopsies and of the products of bronchial alveolar lavage, in particular the mineralogical examinations, may usefully orientate the diagnosis. The bronchial alveolar lavage has the advantage of an easy repetition and of a small invasive character. Moreover this technique is of a rather low financial cost. However the results of these examinations must be interpreted with the greatest caution, in function of the complete medical and occupational data. The experience following more than 500 BAL shows that the discovery of talc and kaolin is very significant for an exposition since these minerals were never observed among not exposed subjects. The evidence of these minerals argues also for the diagnosis of talcosis or kaolinosis if there are radiological lesions that are compatible with these diseases. On the other hand a recent study suggests that the identification of multinuclear macrophages and of tungsten and/of tantalum in the bronchial alveolar lavage is pathognomonic of the pathology of the hard metals.
