60|$|Consul Lingford gulped <b>and</b> <b>sawed</b> <b>the</b> air speechlessly {{with his}} arms.|$|R
60|$|So {{he kissed}} her and went, <b>and</b> Swanhild <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> kiss <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> him go.|$|R

5|$|About 20 {{minutes before}} the plane landed, on its final descent, he {{secretly}} ignited a small explosive device consisting of a mix of plastic explosive powder and acid. Abdulmutallab apparently had a packet of the plastic explosive sewn to his underwear, and injected liquid acid from a syringe into the packet to cause a chemical reaction. While {{there was a small}} explosion and fire, the device failed to detonate properly. Passengers heard popping noises resembling firecrackers, smelled an odor, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> suspect's pants, leg and the wall of the plane on fire.|$|E

He made it a {{condition}} of his acceptance that Northcott be given the appointment of Commander-in-Chief of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in Japan. Sturdee felt that Northcott had missed out on opportunities for active service through his being CGS <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> BCOF post as a just reward for that service.|$|E
5|$|By 1867, church {{authorities}} {{deemed the}} problems with the tower as severe enough to warrant a major reconstruction of the church. George Gilbert Scott, who had recently designed the monumental London buildings of the Foreign Office and St.Pancras Station, was chosen to lead the project. Scott was a leading advocate of the Gothic Revival <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> renovation as a chance to return St.Mary's to a state nearer to its earlier Gothic design.|$|E
5|$|Doggett finally {{embraces the}} memory of his vision. Mulder tells him that when he worked in violent crimes <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> horrible things people did, he began to think of evil like a disease that {{infected}} people.

5|$|In Hong Kong {{in early}} 2014, Invader {{installed}} 48 works. However, the city's Highways Department removed a roadside mosaic in Fortress Hill. Local residents were disappointed, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> removal {{as an example}} of the government only paying lip-service to promoting the arts in the city. In early 2015, a replica of the life-sized Hong Kong Phooey (HK 58) that had been removed, reached HK$1.96 million ($250,000) at auction at Sotheby's.

60|$|Next day the Cat {{waited to}} see if any other Wild thing would go up to the Cave, but no one moved in the Wet Wild Woods, so the Cat walked there by himself; <b>and</b> he <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Woman milking <b>the</b> Cow, <b>and</b> he <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> light of the fire in the Cave, and he smelt the smell of the warm white milk.|$|R
5|$|In November 1897, the BS did a {{deal with}} the London & Globe Finance Corporation (L), a mining finance company {{operated}} by mining speculator Whitaker Wright and chaired by Lord Dufferin. The L was to fund and manage the construction, taking any profit from the process. The cost of construction was estimated to be £1,615,000 (equivalent to approximately £ today).

5|$|In {{the early}} days of sound cinema, among the various {{distinguished}} composers ready to try their hand at film music, Prokofiev was not an obvious choice for the commission.

By early 1933, however, Prokofiev was anxious to return to his homeland, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> film commission as an opportunity to write music in a more popular and accessible style.|$|E
5|$|Kroonland was {{the scene}} of an {{attempted}} murder-suicide in October 1908. Two acquaintances in steerage had an argument over a young female second-class passenger that both men knew.

U.S. Senator Benjamin Tillman and his wife were aboard the liner at the time <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> young man jump overboard. Although the ship lowered a boat to look for him, no trace of him was found, and he was presumed drowned.|$|E

5|$|So I {{went out}} <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> band – Billy, James, and D'arcy – playing at Avalon with a drum machine. Man, did they sound horrible! They were atrocious. But the thing I noticed was {{that not only}} were the song {{structures}} good, but Billy's voice had a lot of drive to it, like he was dying to succeed. So I ended up driving from work every Wednesday to rehearse with them.|$|E
60|$|Stephen turned <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>the</b> cold gaze {{which had}} {{measured}} him {{was not all}} unkind.|$|R
