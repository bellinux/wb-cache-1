5|$|A second {{specimen}} {{was obtained}} in 1966 and the find {{was published in}} 1971 by Hugh Genoways and Knox Jones, who noted that the species is closely similar to O.palustris. Later workers affirmed the relationship between O.dimidiatus, O.palustris and <b>associated</b> <b>species</b> like O.couesi. Fiona Reid reported in 1997 that a third specimen had been found. In 2006, Marcelo Weksler and coworkers removed most of the species formerly placed in Oryzomys from the genus, {{because they are not}} closely related to the type species O.palustris, but kept O.dimidiatus as an Oryzomys.|$|E
5|$|<b>Associated</b> <b>species</b> in the Sydney region include {{heathland}} {{species such}} as heath banksia (Banksia ericifolia), coral heath (Epacris microphylla) and mountain devil (Lambertia formosa), and tick bush (Kunzea ambigua) and prickly-leaved paperbark (Melaleuca nodosa) in taller scrub, and under trees such as scribbly gum (Eucalyptus sclerophylla) and narrow-leaved apple (Angophora bakeri) in woodland. The Agnes Banks Woodland in western Sydney has been recognised by the New South Wales Government as an Endangered Ecological Community. Here B.oblongifolia is an understory plant in low open woodland, with scribbly gum, narrow-leaved apple and old man banksia (B.serrata) as canopy trees, and wallum banksia (B.aemula), variable smoke-bush (Conospermum taxifolium), wedding bush (Ricinocarpos pinifolius), showy parrot-pea (Dillwynia sericea) and nodding geebung (Persoonia nutans) as other understory species.|$|E
5|$|Xerochrysum bracteatum {{occurs in}} all Australian {{mainland}} states and territories, {{as well as}} Tasmania. Widespread, it is found from North Queensland across to Western Australia, and in all habitats excluding densely shaded areas. It grows as an annual in patches of red sand in Central Australia, responding rapidly to bouts of rainfall to complete its lifecycle. It is common among granite outcrops in southwest Western Australia, and is found on heavier and more fertile soils in the Sydney region, such as basalt-, shale-, or limestone-based soils, generally in areas with a high water table. <b>Associated</b> <b>species</b> in the Sydney Basin include blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis) in open forest, and the shrubs Empodisma minus and Baloskion australe in swampy areas. It has been reported growing in disturbed soil, along roadsides and in fields in the New England region in the United States.|$|E

40|$|A {{viscosity}} model {{based on}} the <b>associate</b> <b>species</b> thermodynamic model is currently being developed for liquid melts of the Al 2 O 3 –K 2 O–Na 2 O–SiO 2 –CaO–MgO–FeO–etc. system and subsystems relevant to coal ash slags. In the present publication, {{we focus on the}} quaternary subsystem Al 2 O 3 –SiO 2 –Na 2 O–K 2 O. The model employs concentrations of the <b>associate</b> <b>species</b> obtained from the recent thermodynamic assessments of these systems. Modified Avramov and Arrhenius approaches were investigated as possible means to describe the viscosity. The original viscosity equations were modified to include the compositional and structural dependence of the viscosity. <b>Associate</b> <b>species</b> introduced in the thermodynamic model were found to provide a reasonable approximation of the melt structure that was confirmed by comparison to available spectroscopic data.

40|$|The {{viscosity}} model {{recently developed}} for fully liquid pure oxides and binary systems is extended {{to describe the}} viscosity of multicomponent systems, based on the thermodynamic modified <b>associate</b> <b>species</b> model. In the model the viscosity {{is linked to the}} distribution of <b>associate</b> <b>species</b> as well as the connectivity of <b>associate</b> <b>species.</b> To describe the viscosity for multicomponent systems, the ternary <b>associate</b> <b>species</b> are introduced. The focus of the present paper is to describe the viscosity of the system SiO 2 –Al 2 O 3 –CaO–MgO–Na 2 O–K 2 O and its ternary or higher order subsystems. The model shows a good performance in describing the viscosity using only one set of model parameters, which all have a clear physico-chemical meaning. The viscosity behavior when substituting one network modifier for another at constant SiO 2 contents is well described. The Al 2 O 3 -induced viscosity maximum is also well described, in which the position and magnitude of the viscosity maximum as a function of composition and temperature (charge compensation effect) are properly predicted. Another viscosity maximum when replacing Al 2 O 3 with SiO 2 for constant contents of the network modifiers is well presented. Moreover, the current model is self-consistent, in which the extension of viscosities from lower order systems to higher order systems works well, and vice versa...|$|R

25|$|The aim of {{explicit}} phylogenetic methods {{is to compare}} gene trees with their <b>associated</b> <b>species</b> trees. While weakly supported differences between gene and species trees can be due to inference uncertainty, statistically significant differences can be suggestive of HGT events (see Figure 1a). For example, if two genes from different species share the most recent ancestral connecting node in the gene tree, but the respective species are spaced apart in the species tree, an HGT event can be invoked. Such an approach can produce more detailed results than parametric approaches because the involved species, time and direction of transfer can potentially be identified.|$|E

25|$|The genus Leptocharias {{was coined}} by South African {{physician}} and zoologist Andrew Smith, without any <b>associated</b> <b>species,</b> in an 1838 Magazine of Natural History article by Johannes Müller and Friedrich Henle. Müller and Henle added a species {{a year later}} in their Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen, but adopted the name Triaenodon smithii because they regarded Leptocharias as a junior synonym of Triaenodon. Later authors recognized the validity of Leptocharias, and shuffled it between the families Carcharhinidae and Triakidae before placing it in its own family. The type specimen is an adult male collected off Cabinda Province, Angola.|$|E
25|$|Fire plays a {{key role}} in the ecology of the upper slopes of the Big Sur region's {{mountains}} where chaparral dominates the landscape. Native Americans burned chaparral to promote grasslands for textiles and food. In the lower elevations and canyons, the California Redwood is often found. Its thick bark, along with foliage that starts high above the ground, protect the species from both fire and insect damage, contributing to the coast redwood's longevity. Fire appears to benefit redwoods by removing competitive species. A 2010 study compared post-wildfire survival and regeneration of redwood and <b>associated</b> <b>species.</b> It concluded that fires of all severity increase the relative abundance of redwood and higher-severity fires provide the greatest benefit.|$|E

25|$|Growth {{rates for}} methanotrophic mussels at cold seep sites have been {{reported}} (Fisher, 1995). General growth rates {{were found to be}} relatively high. Adult mussel growth rates were similar to mussels from a littoral environment at similar temperatures. Fisher also found that juvenile mussels at hydrocarbon seeps initially grow rapidly, but the growth rate drops markedly in adults; they grow to reproductive size very quickly. Both individuals and communities appear to be very long lived. These methane-dependent mussels have strict chemical requirements that tie them to areas of the most active seepage in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result of their rapid growth rates, mussel recolonization of a disturbed seep site could occur relatively rapidly. There is some evidence that mussels also have some requirement of a hard substrate and could increase in numbers if suitable substrate is increased on the seafloor (Fisher, 1995). Two <b>associated</b> <b>species</b> are always found associated with mussel beds – the gastropod Bathynerita naticoidea and a small Alvinocarid shrimp – suggesting these endemic species have excellent dispersal abilities and can tolerate a wide range of conditions (MacDonald, 2002).|$|E
