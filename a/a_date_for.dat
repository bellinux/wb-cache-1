He was against date setting for the end of days, concerned that this would put Christianity into disrepute.|$|E

On July 18, 2013, Denver District Court Judge Robert Hyatt issued a preliminary ruling that the recall process must proceed even while Morse and Giron challenged the process in court.

5|$|At a {{preliminary}} hearing on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set <b>a</b> <b>date</b> <b>for</b> December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While {{there was no question}} as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms. After a trial that lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges.|$|E
5|$|During {{a cabinet}} meeting {{towards the end}} of April, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi asked Manekshaw if he was {{prepared}} {{to go to war with}} Pakistan. In response, Manekshaw told her most of his armoured and infantry divisions were deployed elsewhere, only 12 of his tanks were combat-ready, and they would be competing for rail carriages with the grain harvest at that point of time. He also pointed out the Himalayan passes would soon open up, with the forthcoming monsoon in East Pakistan, which would result in heavy flooding. When Gandhi asked the cabinet to leave the room and Manekshaw to stay, he offered to resign. She declined to accept it, but sought his advice. He then said he could guarantee victory if she would allow him to prepare for the conflict on his terms, and set <b>a</b> <b>date</b> <b>for</b> it, and Gandhi agreed.|$|E

5|$|Many workers {{seen in the}} {{background}} of the first season are developed into secondary characters, and romantic relationships begin to develop between some of the characters. Michael spends the night with his boss Jan, {{in the wake of the}} latter's divorce, but does not sleep with her. Dwight and Angela become romantically involved, but keep the relationship a secret from everyone else. Kelly develops a crush on Ryan, and they start dating. When Roy sets <b>a</b> <b>date</b> <b>for</b> his wedding to Pam, Jim grows depressed and considers transferring to the Stamford, Connecticut branch, but tells Pam in the season finale that he loves her, even though Pam still insists she will marry Roy. The two kiss, but Jim transfers to the Stamford branch soon after. The general threat of downsizing continues throughout the season as well.|$|E
5|$|On June 19, 1969, Hendrix flew to Toronto for a {{preliminary}} hearing. He wore {{a business suit}} {{for the first time}} since before the formation of the Experience in late 1966.

More serious potential charges of drug transporting and trafficking, which had been discussed at the time of the arrest, were not filed.|$|E

In 2005, she began dating Micky Jung (real name Jung Yong-jin), a rapper whom she had met online. Jung, who {{had been a member of}} dance group EQ during the 1990s, later joined Harisu's management company and worked on her fourth and fifth albums. The couple briefly separated in 2006, but were reunited after Jung saw her dating another man on a TV show. Rumours that the two were to marry began circulating in November 2006, and <b>a</b> <b>date</b> <b>for</b> the wedding was announced in February, following meetings between their respective families. Harisu and Jung starred in a reality television show on cable network Mnet showing their everyday lives and preparations for their wedding, but the couple were subjected to harsh criticism from netizens.|$|E

5|$|The {{kingdom of}} the East Angles was an {{independent}} and long-lived Anglo-Saxon kingdom that was established after migrants arrived in southeast Suffolk from the area now known as Jutland. Rainbird Clarke identified Wehha {{as one of the}} leaders of the new arrivals: the East Angles are tentatively identified with the Geats of the Old English poem Beowulf. Historians have used sources such as the Anglian collection too as an aid in calculating <b>a</b> <b>date</b> <b>for</b> the establishment of the kingdom. Collingwood and Myers note the use of literacy sources and archaeological finds as evidence in how the region was settled during and after the 5th century, when various disparate groups arrived in Norfolk and Suffolk from different parts of the coast and the rivers of the Fens.|$|E
5|$|Five single {{sheets of}} bark paper were found {{associated}} with the codex, they had no stucco coating and were brown and water stained. Two of these had adhered to the codex {{and the other three}} may have once been with the codex but had separated. One of these sheets had a painted line in the same red hematite pigment used in the codex itself. A smaller sheet of bark paper was attached to the lined sheet and this smaller piece was submitted for radiocarbon dating. This testing produced <b>a</b> <b>date</b> <b>for</b> the sheet of AD 1230 ± 130; this would date the document {{to the end of the}} Early Postclassic period (c. 950–1200) and would make the codex the oldest known surviving Mesoamerican codex. The lack of incrustations or insect damage to the codex suggests that, if genuine, it was stored inside a container for hundreds of years. The overall damaged state of the codex conflicts with the good preservation of surviving parts; it may be that the damaged codex was deliberately decommissioned as a ritual object, rather than being simply discarded.|$|E
5|$|Sawicka's {{time at the}} Lucan {{household}} ended late in March 1973. While {{with two}} of the children near Grosvenor Place, she was confronted by Lucan and two private detectives. They told her that the children had been made wards of court and that she must release them into his custody, which she did. Frances was collected from school later in the day. Lady Lucan applied to the court to have the children returned, but concerned about the case's complexity, the judge set <b>a</b> <b>date</b> <b>for</b> the hearing three months ahead, for June 1973. To defend herself against Lucan's claims about her mental state, Veronica booked herself a four-day stay at the Priory Clinic in Roehampton. While it was acknowledged that she still required some psychiatric support, the doctors reported that there was no indication that she was mentally ill. Lucan's case depended upon Veronica being unable to care for the children, but at the hearing, he was instead forced to defend his own behaviour toward her. After several weeks of witnesses and protracted arguments in camera, on the advice of his lawyers he conceded the case. Unimpressed by Lucan's character, Mr Justice Rees awarded custody to Veronica. The earl was allowed access every other weekend.|$|E

5|$|Starting in November, {{the twins}} {{developed}} an on-screen relationship with The Colóns (Carlito and Primo), appearing in numerous backstage segments with them, and accompanying {{them to the}} ring. In February 2009, the storyline expanded to include John Morrison and The Miz, who flirted with the Bellas and took them on <b>a</b> <b>date</b> <b>for</b> Valentine's Day. The date provoked a rivalry between the teams of The Miz and Morrison and Primo and Carlito, with the four competing for the affection of the twins, who were seemingly unable to choose between them. On March 17 on ECW, Carlito and Primo, aiming for Morrison and The Miz, accidentally spat apples {{in the face of}} Brie. Nikki began to laugh at Brie's misfortune, and a fight broke out between the two, which led to Nikki leaving with The Miz and Morrison, while Brie stayed with Primo and Carlito. Brie won her first match over Nikki in a six-person intergender tag team match on SmackDown the following week. On ECW on March 31, Nikki pinned Brie in their first singles match against each other, after a distraction from Morrison and The Miz.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish {{conflict}} {{flared up}} {{once again in}} 1306, when Robert the Bruce killed his rival John Comyn and declared himself the King of the Scots. Edward I mobilised a fresh army, but decided that this time his son would be formally {{in charge of the}} expedition. Prince Edward was made the Duke of Aquitaine and then, along with many other young men, he was knighted in a lavish ceremony at Westminster Abbey called the Feast of the Swans. Amid a huge feast in the neighbouring hall, reminiscent of Arthurian legends and crusading events, the assembly took a collective oath to defeat Bruce. It is unclear what role Prince Edward's forces played in the campaign that summer, which, under the orders of Edward I, saw a punitive, brutal retaliation against Bruce's faction in Scotland. Edward returned to England in September, where diplomatic negotiations to finalise <b>a</b> <b>date</b> <b>for</b> his wedding to Isabella continued.|$|E
5|$|The Tribal Hidage {{has been}} of great {{importance}} to historians {{since the middle of}} the 19th century, partly because it mentions territories unrecorded in other documents. Attempts to link all the names in the list with modern places are highly speculative and all resulting maps are treated with caution. Three different versions (or recensions) of the Tribal Hidage have survived, two of which resemble each other: one dates from the 11th century and is part of a miscellany of works; another is contained in a 17th-century Latin treatise; the third version, which has survived in six mediaeval manuscripts, has many omissions and spelling variations. All three versions appear {{to be based on the}} same lost manuscript: historians have been unable to establish <b>a</b> <b>date</b> <b>for</b> the original compilation. The Tribal Hidage has been used to construct theories about the political organisation of the Anglo-Saxons, and to give an insight into the Mercian state and its neighbours at a time when Mercia held hegemony over a number of other peoples. It has been used to support theories regarding the origin and location of the tribes in the list and the way in which the tribes were systematically assessed and ruled by others. Some historians have proposed that the Tribal Hidage is not a list of peoples but of administrative areas.|$|E

5|$|Theophilus, {{through his}} father, {{applied to the}} Lord Chamberlain during the summer asking {{to have a new}} license issued, but he was refused. Following this, he applied to Charles Lee, the Master of the Revels, and {{received}} a license to perform theatrical shows in return for payment even though the license had no legal authority. This brought about criticism against Lee in the Daily Post dated 29 September 1733 over issuing the licence and called it just a ploy by the actors. On 30 October, the management of the Theatre Royal sent a letter to veteran actor John Mills and other rebels threatening further legal action regarding their unlicensed theatre. After Theophilus responded with a claim that he was acting within the law, the management and John Rich, manager of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, demanded the courts to shut down the unlicensed theatres. A 5 November hearing set <b>a</b> <b>date</b> <b>for</b> a trial, but the case fell apart before it was ever heard over the technical wording of a law that conflicted with the original request by the licensed theatre managers.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{numerous}} vitrified forts, {{the walls of}} which have been subjected to fire, which may date to this period, but an accurate chronology has proven to be evasive. When first noted in the nineteenth century it was assumed that vitrification had been deliberately undertaken as part of the building process to harden walls, but this hypothesis was rejected by V. Gordon Childe in the 1940s and subsequent excavations have indicated that, since the debris from such walls fell on the deposits of occupation it could not {{have been part of the}} building process. Reconstructions have indicated the difficulty of deliberately firing timbers in this way, particularly in the prevailing climatic conditions in Scotland, and it is more likely that this was done as part of a process of fort destruction, either after conquest or when abandoned by the inhabitants. Extensive studies of such a fort at Finavon Hill near Forfar in Angus, suggest dates for the destruction of the site in either the last two centuries BCE, or the mid-first millennium CE. Excavations at Dunnideer, Aberdeenshire indicate <b>a</b> <b>date</b> <b>for</b> its destruction in the period 500–250 BCE.|$|E
5|$|Under the Scotland Act 1998, {{ordinary}} {{general elections}} for the Scottish Parliament are held on the first Thursday in May every four years (1999, 2003, 2007 and so on). The date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either way by the Monarch on the proposal of the Presiding Officer. If the Parliament itself resolves {{that it should be}} dissolved (with at least two-thirds of the Members voting in favour), or if the Parliament fails to nominate one of its members to be First Minister within 28 days of a General Election or of the position becoming vacant, the Presiding Officer proposes <b>a</b> <b>date</b> <b>for</b> an extraordinary general election and the Parliament is dissolved by the Queen by royal proclamation. Extraordinary general elections are in addition to ordinary general elections, unless held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election, in which case they supplant it. The following ordinary election reverts to the first Thursday in May, a multiple of four years after 1999 (i.e., 5 May 2011, 7 May 2015, etc.).|$|E
