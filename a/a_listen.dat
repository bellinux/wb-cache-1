500|$|When {{preparing}} the final mixes for the Experience's debut album, Chandler {{chose to use}} the December 13, 1966, track recorded at CBS: [...] "Later when we were scrambling to put the album together, we carted that [...] out and gave it <b>a</b> <b>listen.</b> [...] We remixed it at Olympic and added it to the album". [...] Track Records issued the monaural mix on Are You Experienced, which was released on May 12, 1967, in the UK. [...] At the time, it was industry practice in the US to include singles on albums. [...] So when the album was released in the US, [...] "Purple Haze", [...] "Hey Joe" [...] and [...] "The Wind Cries Mary" [...] were included {{at the expense of}} [...] "Red House" [...] and two other songs. [...] Hendrix later questioned the choice and commented [...] "Everybody was scared to release 'Red House' in America because they said, 'America don't like the blues, man!'" ...|$|E

It's an incredibly long process." [...] Regular Arcade Fire collaborators Owen Pallett and Colin Stetson provided instrumental parts, alongside English musician David Bowie who provided vocals for the song. Regarding Bowie's guest appearance on the track, multi-instrumentalist Richard Reed Parry noted, [...] "It was just after The Next Day had come out. He basically just came by the studio in New York while we were mixing, just to have <b>a</b> <b>listen</b> to the stuff we were doing. He offered to lend us his services because he really liked the song. In fact, he basically threatened us – he was like, 'If you don't hurry up and mix this song, I might just steal it from you!' So we thought, well why don't we go one better, why don't you sing on our version? Thankfully he obliged, and we were really happy about that." ...|$|E

500|$|Purist {{critics in}} jazz {{complained about the}} music's {{incorporation}} of danceable beats and electric guitar. In Stereo Review, Chris Albertson deemed the combination of saxophone and bizarre funk occasionally captivating but ultimately unfocused. Dan Sullivan of the Los Angeles Times believed the album's supporters in [...] "hip rock circles" [...] had overlooked flaws, arguing that Tacuma and Coleman's playing sounded like a unique [...] "beacon of clarity" [...] amid an incessant background. Leonard Feather wrote in the Toledo Blade deemed the music stylistically ambiguous, potentially controversial, and difficult to assess but interesting enough to warrant <b>a</b> <b>listen.</b> At the end of 1982, Billboard editor Peter Keepnews named Of Human Feelings the year's best album, calling it {{a prime example of}} fusing free jazz with modern funk. In year-end lists for The Boston Phoenix, James Hunter and Howard Hampton ranked the album number one and number four, respectively. It was voted 13th best in the Pazz& Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published in The Village Voice. Christgau, the poll's supervisor, ranked it number one in an accompanying list, and in 1990 he named it the second-best album of the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|When Walden {{started to}} look for a record label for Jenkins, Atlantic Records {{representative}} Joe Galkin showed interest and around 1962 sent him to the Stax studio in Memphis. Redding drove Jenkins to the session, as the latter did not have a driver's license. The session with Jenkins, backed by Booker T. & the M.G.'s, was unproductive and ended early; Redding was allowed to perform two songs. The first was [...] "Hey Hey Baby", which studio chief Jim Stewart thought sounded too much like Little Richard. The second was [...] "These Arms of Mine", featuring Jenkins on piano and Steve Cropper on guitar. Stewart later praised Redding's performance, saying, [...] "Everybody was fixin' to go home, but Joe Galkin insisted we give Otis <b>a</b> <b>listen.</b> There was something different about [...] He really poured his soul into it." [...] Stewart signed Redding and released [...] "These Arms of Mine", with [...] "Hey Hey Baby" [...] on the B-side. The single was released by Volt in October 1962 and charted in March the following year. It became one of his most successful songs, selling more than 800,000 copies.|$|E
500|$|Spence D. of IGN said, [...] "If Britney Spears' Greatest Hits: My Prerogative {{illuminates}} anything it's that Spears is {{a fairly}} proficient sonic chameleon, able to mimic and adopt the stylings {{of those who have}} come before her with enough panache and verve to convince younger generations that she's a bona fide pop revelation. [...] This is the kind of kitschy album that {{you can get away with}} having because Spears is such a prevalent component of pop culture." [...] James Gashinski of The Gazette said that [...] "As a time capsule, My Prerogative does its job well," [...] but [...] "Added together, the pop hits on this album are somewhat less than the sum of their parts". He explained, [...] "Even if it isn't as great <b>a</b> <b>listen</b> as a cohesive album, My Prerogative does work as a portrait of the time when Britney Spears was the defining figure of American pop culture". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic agreed with Gashinski, but added [...] "if you compare it to The Immaculate Collection, which captured the time when Madonna was the defining figure of American pop culture and does work as an album, it's clear that a cultural artifact isn't necessarily the same thing as great music".|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} listed {{as one of the}} best songs of the year by several publications. The New York Times placed the song amongst the best tracks of 2011. Ology's JT Langley placed the song amongst the best of the year, writing [...] "Frank makes a foul mouth sound sweeter than your usual R through his brand of crooning, and Tricky Stewart's {{production}} adds yet another morose element to provide the more macabre side of the drugs-for-love-lost genre." [...] Pitchfork named the song the 41st best song of the year, musing that [...] "he might be fronting like the Drakes and post-"808s" [...] Kanyes of the world, but there's too much self-effacement happening for Ocean not to realize the inherent humor in his own drama. If Ocean really is on that visionary Kubrick shit like he claims, then [...] "Novacane" [...] could very well be his Dr. Strangelove. Zimbio placed the song at number 2 on their best hip-hop songs of the year list, writing [...] "while every track on his mixtape, nostalgia, Ultra, warrants <b>a</b> <b>listen,</b> it's the radio-friendly [...] "Novacane" [...] that stands out as his most mature and enjoyable song to date." [...] Spin named the song the fifth best of the year, describing the track as [...] "a fully evolved Drake song, where you're slyly immersed in youthful, aww-shit decadence, while simultaneously watching your dreams of recreational stripper booty and complimentary cocaine breakfasts get methodically dismantled." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first session}} was on 26 February, {{three of the}} first songs—fully {{recorded}}—attempted during the session were [...] "Baby Lemonade", [...] "Maisie" [...] and [...] "Gigolo Aunt". However, Gilmour thought they were losing the [...] "Barrett-ness". After [...] "Baby Lemonade" [...] was attempted, 2 takes of [...] "Maisie" [...] were recorded before Barrett went into 15 takes of [...] "Gigolo Aunt". The next day, two-track demos of [...] "Wolfpack", [...] "Waving My Arms in the Air", [...] "Living Alone" [...] and [...] "Bob Dylan Blues", were recorded. The former two {{made it to the}} album; the latter two didn't. On the recording sheet, it lists Gilmour as having taken home a copy of the latter two, Gilmour later returned and took the master tapes too. Gilmour has since said [...] "Those sessions were done so quickly. We were rushing to gigs every day and had to fit recording sessions in between. I probably took it away to have <b>a</b> <b>listen</b> and simply forgot to take it back. It wasn't intended to be a final mix. Syd knocked it off, I took a tape home." [...] Despite some minor work made to [...] "Gigolo Aunt", Barrett wouldn't return to Abbey Road Studios until 1 April, due to Pink Floyd working on their 1970 album, Atom Heart Mother. On various occasions, Barrett would [...] "spy" [...] on the band as they recorded the album. Again, Barrett recorded some work to a song, [...] "Wolfpack," [...] on the 3rd, before the sessions were postponed until 5 June, this time due to Gilmour and Wright going on tour in the US with Pink Floyd.|$|E

May 29, 2012) heard them. Certain her father would be impressed, she led the blind musician over for <b>a</b> <b>listen.</b> The group [...] "struck up 'Oh My Little Darling', a well-known old-time song they thought Doc would like." [...] When they finished, he said: [...] "Boys, that was {{some of the most}} authentic old-time music I've heard in a long while. You almost got me crying."

2500|$|Daryl Braithwaite's cover {{version of}} Rickie Lee Jones' album track, [...] "The Horses", {{remained}} popular after 25 years.

I'll {{bring it in}} tomorrow and I reckon we could do a version in the vein of 'As the Days Go By' from the first album, Edge. Anyway, I brought it in and they had <b>a</b> <b>listen</b> to it." [...] He acknowledged that [...] "you have to give credit to , who then took [...] version {{and turned it into}} more accessible pop, maybe. There's no doubt: I love it.

2500|$|The film's title {{refers to}} one of the trucks, which has the name [...] "Sorcerer" [...] painted across the hood (the other is named [...] "Lazaro"); there is no supernatural or magical {{character}} or event. As director William Friedkin went location scouting in Ecuador and researched the peculiar ornaments on cargo trucks he had seen there, he noticed there were names painted on them, which ranged from relatives to mythological references. First the director came up with the name Lazaro after Lazarus. Then after some time struggling to think on another moniker, <b>a</b> <b>listen</b> to the Miles Davis album Sorcerer served as an inspiration to name the other truck, though the word was painted in French: [...] "Sorcier". Friedkin then decided to change his working title Ballbreaker for Sorcerer, which he described as [...] "an intentional but ill-advised reference to The Exorcist".|$|E

2500|$|Among Beatle biographers, Robert Rodriguez {{includes}} McCartney in his chapter {{covering the}} worst solo albums {{issued by the}} former band members between 1970 and 1980, saying: [...] "For anyone wanting {{to get to the}} root of the most common rap against Paul's solo output, look no further …" [...] While bemoaning the lack of quality control that allowed [...] "charmless ditties" [...] such as [...] "Teddy Boy" [...] to go under-developed, Rodriguez writes: [...] "What made McCartney so frustrating <b>a</b> <b>listen</b> was not the absence of compelling musical ideas; it was the abundance of them. Had melodies like 'Momma Miss America' been teased out into compositions with a beginning, middle, end, and point, McCartney could have ended up as highly regarded in its own way as Plastic Ono Band: a full slate of focused, listener-friendly pop confections that might very well have given fans far less cause for bitterness at the Beatles' breakup." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, a few critics took a more-mixed {{view of the}} album. Emma Johnston {{from the}} English {{language}} version of Metal Hammer rated the album six out of ten, pointing out that [...] "there's little here to have progressive scene-leaders like Opeth looking over their shoulders." [...] She elaborated that apart from the string-drenched interlude on [...] "Dawn of Redemption", [...] "Extol hardly shifts out of a single gear, but it's worth <b>a</b> <b>listen</b> {{for those who like}} their genres bobbing around in a big old melting pot." [...] Anthony Peronto of Christian Music Zine rated it at three-point-seventy-five out of five, summarizing that while metal pioneer comebacks are not entirely new, this one did not entirely click with him. He concluded that [...] "The music itself was excellence in and of itself but perhaps it was the odd mix of vocals that let me down. I guarantee after a few listens even a doubter like me will warm up to return of Extol and the album they've always intended to create." [...] Mario of Metal 4 rated the album six out of ten, stating the while the album is decent, it also is fairly predictable.|$|E
