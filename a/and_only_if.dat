5|$|A k-coloring, {{for some}} integer k, is an {{assignment}} {{of one of}} k colors to each vertex of a graph G such that the endpoints of each edge get different colors. The k-colorings of G correspond exactly to homomorphisms from G to the complete graph K'k. Indeed, the vertices of K'k correspond to the k colors, and two colors are adjacent as vertices of K'k if {{and if they are}} different. Hence a function defines a homomorphism to K'k if <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> it maps adjacent vertices of G to different colors (i.e., it is a k-coloring). In particular, G is k-colorable if <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> it is K'k-colorable.|$|E

5|$|The {{determinant}} det(A) or |A| of {{a square}} matrix A {{is a number}} encoding certain properties of the matrix. A matrix is invertible if <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> its determinant is nonzero. Its absolute value equals the area (in R2) or volume (in R3) {{of the image of}} the unit square (or cube), while its sign corresponds to the orientation of the corresponding linear map: the determinant is positive if <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> the orientation is preserved.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{injective}} homomorphism from G to H (i.e., {{one that}} never maps distinct vertices to one vertex) if <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> G is a subgraph of H.|$|E

5|$|Hassler Whitney {{showed that}} if the graph is 3-connected then the embedding, and thus the dual graph, is unique. By Steinitz's theorem, these graphs are exactly the {{polyhedral}} graphs, the graphs of convex polyhedra. A planar graph is 3-vertex-connected if <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> its dual graph is 3-vertex-connected. More generally, a planar graph has a unique embedding, and therefore also a unique dual, if <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> it is a subdivision of a 3-vertex-connected planar graph (a graph formed from a 3-vertex-connected planar graph by replacing some of its edges by paths). For some planar graphs that are not 3-vertex-connected, such as the complete bipartite graph , the embedding is not unique, but all embeddings are isomorphic. When this happens, correspondingly, all dual graphs are isomorphic.|$|E
5|$|This {{follows from}} the fact that finding Hamiltonian cycles in maximal planar graphs is NP-complete. In a maximal planar graph, the book {{thickness}} is two if <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> a Hamiltonian cycle exists. Therefore, it is also NP-complete to test whether the book thickness of a given maximal planar graph is two.|$|E
