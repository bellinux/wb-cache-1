5|$|Vertebral artery {{dissection}} (VAD) is a flap-like tear of {{the inner}} lining of the vertebral artery, which {{is located in the}} neck and supplies blood to the brain. After the tear, blood enters the arterial wall and forms a blood clot, thickening the <b>artery</b> <b>wall</b> and often impeding blood flow. The symptoms of vertebral artery dissection include head and neck pain and intermittent or permanent stroke symptoms such as difficulty speaking, impaired coordination and visual loss. It is usually diagnosed with a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scan.|$|E
25|$|An {{atheroma}} is {{an accumulation}} of degenerative material in the inner layer of an <b>artery</b> <b>wall.</b> The material consists of mostly macrophage cells, or debris, containing lipids, calcium and a variable amount of fibrous connective tissue. The accumulated material forms a swelling in the <b>artery</b> <b>wall,</b> which may intrude into the channel of the artery, narrowing it and restricting blood flow. Atheroma occurs in atherosclerosis, {{which is one of}} the three subtypes of arteriosclerosis (which are atherosclerosis, Monckeberg's arteriosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis).|$|E
25|$|The intima-media {{thickness}} of the carotid <b>artery</b> <b>wall</b> is a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis, it increases with age and with long-term exposure to particulate air pollution.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>artery</b> <b>walls</b> enlarge at {{locations}} with atheroma, detecting atheroma {{before death}} and autopsy {{has long been}} problematic at best. Most methods {{have focused on the}} openings of arteries; highly relevant, yet totally miss the atheroma within <b>artery</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R
50|$|Calcium channel {{blockers}} {{block the}} entry of calcium into muscle cells in <b>artery</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R
2500|$|It {{has also}} been pointed out that some {{infectious}} agents with positive correlation to MS, specially Chlamydia pneumoniae, can cause problems in veins and <b>arteries</b> <b>walls</b> ...|$|R
25|$|In effect, {{the muscular}} {{portion of the}} <b>artery</b> <b>wall</b> forms small aneurysms just {{large enough to hold}} the {{atheroma}} that are present. The muscular portion of artery walls usually remain strong, even after they have remodeled to compensate for the atheromatous plaques.|$|E
25|$|Over time, atheromata usually {{progress}} {{in size and}} thickness and induce the surrounding muscular central region (the media) of the artery to stretch out, termed remodeling, typically just enough to compensate for their size such that the caliber of the artery opening (lumen) remains unchanged until typically over 50% of the <b>artery</b> <b>wall</b> cross-sectional area consists of atheromatous tissue.|$|E
25|$|The {{calcification}} deposits, {{after they}} have become sufficiently advanced, are partially visible on coronary artery computed tomography or electron beam tomography (EBT) as rings of increased radiographic density, forming halos around the outer edges of the atheromatous plaques, within the <b>artery</b> <b>wall.</b> On CT, >130 units on the Hounsfield scale (some argue for 90 units) has been the radiographic density usually accepted as clearly representing tissue calcification within arteries. These deposits demonstrate unequivocal evidence of the disease, relatively advanced, even though the lumen of the artery is often still normal by angiography.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{atherosclerosis}} {{begins in}} childhood, as {{a thin layer}} of white-yellowish streaks with the inner layers of the <b>artery</b> <b>walls</b> (an accumulation of white blood cells, mostly monocytes/macrophages) and progresses from there.|$|R
25|$|Fusiform dolichoectatic aneurysms {{represent}} a widening of {{a segment of}} an artery around the entire blood vessel, rather than just arising from a side of an <b>artery's</b> <b>wall.</b> They can rupture but usually do not.|$|R
5000|$|Surgery {{to widen}} or unblock a blood vessel usually has a {{long-lasting}} beneficial {{effect for the}} patient. However, in some cases, the procedure itself can cause further narrowing of the vessel, or restenosis. Angioplasty, also called {{percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty}} (PTCA), is commonly used to treat blockages of the coronary arteries, or peripheral arteries such as in the limbs. The balloon inserted into the narrowing ‘smashes’ the cholesterol plaques (atherosclerosis) against the <b>artery</b> <b>walls,</b> thus widening the size of the lumen and increasing blood flow. However the action damages the <b>artery</b> <b>walls,</b> and they respond by using physiological mechanisms to repair the damage. (See physiology below.) ...|$|R
25|$|Though not {{the focus}} of the test, {{calcification}} within the artery walls, located in the outer edges of atheroma within the artery walls, is sometimes recognizable on fluoroscopy (without contrast injection) as radiodense halo rings partially encircling, and separated from the blood filled lumen by the interceding radiolucent atheroma tissue and endothelial lining. Calcification, even though usually present, is usually only visible when quite advanced and calcified sections of the <b>artery</b> <b>wall</b> happen to be viewed on end tangentially through multiple rings of calcification, so as to create enough radiodensity to be visible on fluoroscopy.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, the Czech {{physiologist}} Jan Peňáz invented and patented {{the volume}} clamp method of measuring continuous blood pressure. The {{principle of the}} volume clamp method is to dynamically provide equal pressures, {{on either side of}} an <b>artery</b> <b>wall.</b> By clamping the artery to a certain volume, inside pressure—intra-arterial pressure—balances outside pressure—finger cuff pressure. Peñáz decided the finger was the optimal site to apply this volume clamp method. The use of finger cuffs excludes the device from application in patients without vasoconstriction, such as in sepsis or in patients on vasopressors.|$|E
25|$|The healthy {{epicardial}} {{coronary artery}} {{consists of three}} layers, the intima, media, and adventitia. Atheroma {{and changes in the}} <b>artery</b> <b>wall</b> usually result in small aneurysms (enlargements) just large enough to compensate for the extra wall thickness with no change in the lumen diameter. However, eventually, typically as a result of rupture of vulnerable plaques and clots within the lumen over the plaque, stenosis (narrowing) of the vessel develops in some areas. Less frequently, the artery enlarges so much that a gross aneurysmal enlargement of the artery results. All three results are often observed, at different locations, within the same individual.|$|E
50|$|It's {{also found}} that E-selectin {{expression}} increased in human ruptured cerebral aneurysm tissues. E-selectin might {{be an important factor}} involved in the process of cerebral aneurysm formation and rupture, by promoting inflammation and weakening cerebral <b>artery</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. In this B-mode {{ultrasound}} {{study we}} assessed pravastatin treatment effects on carotid and femoral <b>artery</b> <b>walls</b> and investigated {{the correlations between}} the state and evolution of peripheral and coronary atherosclerosis. Background. The Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study (REGRESS) was an 11 -center, 2 -year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective study of 885 men with coronary artery disease (CAD) (total cholesterol 4 to 8 mmol/liter). The study primarily investigated pravastatin treatment effects on the coronary lumen. This report focuses on the 255 patients who participated in the REGRESS ultrasound study. Methods. Carotid and femoral <b>artery</b> <b>walls</b> were imaged at baseline and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Pravastatin treatment effect was defined as the difference in progression of the combined intima-media thicknesses (IMT) between treatment groups. Results. Pravastatin treatment effects were highly significant (combined IMT: p = 0. 0085; combined far wall IMT: p 0. 30). Conclusions. Pravastatin treatment effects on carotid and femoral <b>artery</b> <b>walls</b> were observed. B-mode ultrasound imaging studies of peripheral arterial walls could not describe the state and evolution of the coronary lumen in the individual patient, but proved to be a highly suitable tool for the assessment of antiatherosclerotic properties of agents...|$|R

25|$|Arterial ultrasound, {{especially}} of the carotid arteries, with measurement of {{the thickness of the}} <b>artery</b> <b>wall,</b> offers a way to partially track the disease progression. As of 2006, the thickness, commonly referred to as IMT for intimal-medial thickness, is not measured clinically though it has been used by some researchers since the mid-1990s to track changes in arterial walls. Traditionally, clinical carotid ultrasounds have only estimated the degree of blood lumen restriction, stenosis, a result of very advanced disease. The National Institute of Health did a five-year $5 million study, headed by medical researcher Kenneth Ouriel, to study intravascular ultrasound techniques regarding atherosclerotic plaque. More progressive clinicians have begun using IMT measurement as a way to quantify and track disease progression or stability within individual patients.|$|E
2500|$|Radiographic IMT is {{more often}} {{approximated}} using advanced CAT scanners due {{to the ability to}} use software to more slowly and carefully process the images (after the patient's scan has been completed) and then examine artery segments from whatever angle appears most appropriate. In particular some papers have recently produced that indicated that CT and US have an excellent agreement in the analysis of the IMT (in CT analysis is known as CAWT : carotid <b>artery</b> <b>wall</b> thickness) ...|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{damage to}} the {{endothelium}} results in an inflammatory response. Monocytes enter the <b>artery</b> <b>wall</b> from the bloodstream, with platelets adhering {{to the area of}} insult. This may be promoted by redox signaling induction of factors such as VCAM-1, which recruit circulating monocytes, and M-CSF, which is selectively required for the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages. The monocytes differentiate into macrophages, which ingest oxidized LDL, slowly turning into large [...] "foam cells" [...] – so-called because of their changed appearance resulting from the numerous internal cytoplasmic vesicles and resulting high lipid content. Under the microscope, the lesion now appears as a fatty streak. Foam cells eventually die and further propagate the inflammatory process.|$|E
50|$|The {{well known}} effect of sodium on blood {{pressure}} {{can be explained}} by comparing blood to a solution with its salinity changed by ingested salt. <b>Artery</b> <b>walls</b> are analogous to a selectively permeable membrane, and they allow solutes, including sodium and chloride, to pass through (or not), depending on osmosis.|$|R
40|$|Background Basement {{membranes}} in {{the walls}} of cerebral capillaries and arteries form a major lymphatic drainage pathway for fluid and solutes from the brain. Amyloid-? (A?) draining from the brain is deposited in such perivascular pathways as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). CAA increases in severity when A? {{is removed from the}} brain parenchyma by immunotherapy for AD. In this study we investigated the consequences of immune complexes in <b>artery</b> <b>walls</b> upon drainage of solutes similar to soluble A?. We tested the hypothesis that, following active immunization with ovalbumin, immune complexes form within the <b>walls</b> of cerebral <b>arteries</b> and impair the perivascular drainage of solutes from the brain. Mice were immunized against ovalbumin and then challenged by intracerebral microinjection of ovalbumin. Perivascular drainage of solutes was quantified following intracerebral microinjection of soluble fluorescent 3 kDa dextran into the brain at different time intervals after intracerebral challenge with ovalbumin. Results Ovalbumin, IgG and complement C 3 co-localized in basement membranes of <b>artery</b> <b>walls</b> 24 hrs after challenge with antigen; this was associated with significantly reduced drainage of dextran in immunized mice. Conclusions Perivascular drainage along <b>artery</b> <b>walls</b> returned to normal by 7 days. These results indicate that immune complexes form in association with basement membranes of cerebral arteries and interfere transiently with perivascular drainage of solutes from the brain. Immune complexes formed during immunotherapy for AD may similarly impair perivascular drainage of soluble A? and increase severity of CAA...|$|R
50|$|Arteriosclerosis is the thickening, {{hardening}} {{and loss}} of elasticity of the <b>walls</b> of <b>arteries.</b> This process gradually restricts the blood flow to one's organs and tissues {{and can lead to}} severe health risks brought on by atherosclerosis, which is a specific form of arteriosclerosis caused by the buildup of fatty plaques, cholesterol, and some other substances in and on the <b>artery</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The fibro-lipid (fibro-fatty) plaque is {{characterized}} by an accumulation of lipid-laden cells underneath the intima of the arteries, typically without narrowing the lumen due to compensatory expansion of the bounding muscular layer of the <b>artery</b> <b>wall.</b> Beneath the endothelium there is a [...] "fibrous cap" [...] covering the atheromatous [...] "core" [...] of the plaque. The core consists of lipid-laden cells (macrophages and smooth muscle cells) with elevated tissue cholesterol and cholesterol ester content, fibrin, proteoglycans, collagen, elastin, and cellular debris. [...] In advanced plaques, the central core of the plaque usually contains extracellular cholesterol deposits (released from dead cells), which form areas of cholesterol crystals with empty, needle-like clefts. At {{the periphery of the}} plaque are younger [...] "foamy" [...] cells and capillaries. These plaques usually produce the most damage to the individual when they rupture.|$|E
2500|$|Veins do {{not develop}} atheromata, {{because they are}} not {{subjected}} to the same hemodynamic pressure that arteries are, unless surgically moved to function as an artery, as in bypass surgery. The accumulation (swelling) is always in the tunica intima, between the endothelium lining and the smooth muscle middle layer of the <b>artery</b> <b>wall.</b> While the early stages, based on gross appearance, have traditionally been termed fatty streaks by pathologists, they are not composed of fat cells but of accumulations of white blood cells, especially macrophages, that have taken up oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL). [...] After they accumulate large amounts of cytoplasmic membranes (with associated high cholesterol content) they are called foam cells. [...] When foam cells die, their contents are released, which attracts more macrophages and creates an extracellular lipid core near the center to inner surface of each atherosclerotic plaque. Conversely, the outer, older portions of the plaque become more calcified, less metabolically active and more physically stiff over time.|$|E

5000|$|LDL {{particles}} (though {{far different}} from cholesterol per se) are {{sometimes referred to as}} bad cholesterol because they can transport their content of lipid molecules into <b>artery</b> <b>walls,</b> attract macrophages, and thus drive atherosclerosis [...] In contrast, HDL particles are often called good cholesterol or healthy cholesterol because they can remove lipid molecules from macrophages in the <b>wall</b> of <b>arteries.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{accumulation}} {{of the white}} blood cells is termed [...] "fatty streaks" [...] early on because of the appearance being {{similar to that of}} marbled steak. These accumulations contain both living, active white blood cells (producing inflammation) and remnants of dead cells, including cholesterol and triglycerides. The remnants eventually include calcium and other crystallized materials within the outermost and oldest plaque. The [...] "fatty streaks" [...] reduce the elasticity of the <b>artery</b> <b>walls.</b> However, they do not affect blood flow for decades because the <b>artery</b> muscular <b>wall</b> enlarges at the locations of plaque. The wall stiffening may eventually increase pulse pressure; widened pulse pressure is one possible result of advanced disease within the major arteries.|$|R
