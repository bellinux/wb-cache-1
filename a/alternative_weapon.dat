A mostly linear exploration of the castle is broken up with boss fights, many of which are characters from the original arcade game, but not all.

Health and Mana meters are also introduced and can be given upgrades throughout the game. A crossbow is also introduced and is used as an <b>alternative</b> <b>weapon</b> and resourceful object for puzzles.

5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{commonly}} offered explanation is that World War II (1939-1945) aircraft machine gun belts were nine yards long. There are many versions of this explanation with variations regarding type of plane, nationality of gunner and geographic area. An <b>alternative</b> <b>weapon</b> is the ammunition belt for the British Vickers machine gun, invented and adopted by the British Army before World War I (1914-1918). The standard belt for this gun held 250 rounds of ammunition and was approximately twenty feet (under seven yards) in length. [...] However, the Vickers gun as fitted to aircraft during the First World War usually had ammunition containers capable of accommodating linked belts of 350-400 rounds, {{the average length of}} such a belt being about nine yards, and it was thought that this may be the origin of the phrase. [...] This theory is no longer considered viable, since the phrase predates World War I.|$|E
50|$|According to {{the book}} Weaponry: An Illustrated History, by Chuck Wills, between the late 16th century and the {{advances}} in repeating firearms in the mid 19th century, blades or clubs were often fitted onto guns, because only one shot could be fired from the gun. Without an <b>alternative</b> <b>weapon</b> attachment, they became useless at close range. Some of the first included the German Ax-Pistol, made in the central European region of Silesia. This weapon combined a flintlock pistol with a battleaxe. Later, a Pistol-Sword combination formed in the mid 18th century, which was apparently used mainly by marines and naval officers in boarding engagements at sea. Additionally, Dumonthier & Sons produced several knife pistol combinations. Pocket knives with zip guns inside were made by Unwin & Rodgers, and an Indian gunsmith fitted a percussion cap gun to a mace in the 19th century. Even some shields were fitted with barrels, sometimes designed {{to look like a}} spike, and other times placed in cleverly concealed holes.|$|E

India delivered HAL Dhruv helicopters and South Africa is about to deliver 12 Atlas Cheetah supersonic-aircraft. Ecuador's political ally, Venezuela, donated military equipment and six Mirage 50 aircraft. In 2010, the U.S. embassy in Ecuador announced that it had delivered $1.2 million of donated military equipment to the Ecuadorian military. The donations were intended to support operations countering drug-smuggling and guerilla activity along its Colombian border.

Đn this effort, a closer look is taken at the countries using turboprop aircraft in CAS missions while observing the fields these aircraft are used in, type of operations, specifications of the aircraft, cost and the maintenance factors. Thus, an idea about the convenience of using these aircraft in such operations can be obtained. A SWOT analysis of turboprop aircraft in CAS operations is performed.
