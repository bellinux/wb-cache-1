Gameplay involves moving Simon around and interacting with objects and other characters. The player can make Simon perform actions such as giving <b>an</b> <b>item</b> to another character, talk to another character, {{and pick up}} (add to inventory), examine, use, move, consume, wear, or open or close <b>an</b> <b>item.</b> Some actions are binary: they involve two objects and the player sometimes, after telling Simon to use <b>an</b> <b>item,</b> needs to specify what to use it with. A map that enables Simon to instantly transport to a major landmark (if it has been discovered) is provided. The postcard is used to load, save, or quit the game.|$|E
