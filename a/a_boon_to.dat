5|$|In 1894, the Chautauqua {{movement}} {{made its}} way to Gladstone. Judge Cross established a fifty-year lease of Gladstone Park for this event after he was convinced by Oregon City author Eva Emery Dye that doing so would be <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> the city and its people. Beginning on July 24–26, 1894, the newly formed Willamette Valley Chautauqua Association held an annual summer assembly that offered performances, lectures, and concerts. This event would reoccur annually, until Gladstone's Chautauqua Park grew to be the third-largest permanent Chautauqua assembly park in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Odessa, {{he got a}} job distributing newspapers. This respectable work {{required}} {{getting up}} at 6 a.m., not good for a carouser. Still, newspaper connection meant that he soon heard of one of the war's other effects: the many Jewish merchants and middlemen war brought to Bucharest were <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> Abraham Goldfaden's nascent Yiddish theater there. Two of his Odessa acquaintances—Israel Rosenberg, a personable con-man, and Jacob Spivakofsky, scion of a wealthy Jewish family—had become actors there, then had left Goldfaden to found their own company, touring in Moldavia. Adler wrote them to urge them to bring their troupe to Odessa.|$|E
5|$|Although this {{decision}} was <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> the Stationers, it was short-lived. Following Millar, the right to print The Seasons was sold to a coalition of publishers including Thomas Becket. Two Scottish printers, Alexander and John Donaldson, began publishing an unlicensed edition, and Becket successfully obtained an injunction to stop them. This decision was appealed in Donaldson v Beckett, and eventually went to the House of Lords. After consulting with the judges of the King's Bench, Common Pleas and Exchequer of Pleas, the Lords concluded that copyright was not perpetual, and that the term permitted by the Statute of Anne was the maximum length of legal protection for publishers and authors alike.|$|E

5|$|For some time, {{there had}} been concern {{about the power of}} the railroads and the way they charged {{different}} rates for different customers. In 1885, a bill to regulate the practice, authored by John Henninger Reagan, of Texas passed the House. The Reagan bill forbade discrimination in railroad or pipeline freight rates, required that rates be reasonable, and fixed maximum charges allowed. Sherman agreed with the general idea of the law, but objected to certain portions, especially a provision that gave state courts jurisdiction over enforcement disputes. Sherman believed the law should allow for more nuance as well, insisting that competition against other forms of transit be considered. These changes were adopted in the conference committee and the result, the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, owed much to Sherman's influence. Cleveland signed it into law on February 4, 1887, and appointed members to the new Interstate Commerce Commission. The act displeased the railroad industry, but was <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> farmers and the oil industry.|$|E
5|$|The fall of Atlanta and {{the success}} of the overall Atlanta Campaign were {{extensively}} covered by Northern newspapers, and were <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> Northern morale and to President Lincoln's political standing. The 1864 election was between General George B. McClellan and Abraham Lincoln. McClellan ran a conflicted campaign - McClellan was a Unionist who advocated continuing the war until the defeat of the Confederacy, but the Democratic platform included calls for negotiations with the Confederacy on the subject of a potential truce. The capture of Atlanta and Hood's burning of military facilities as he evacuated showed that a successful conclusion of the war was in sight, weakening support for a truce. Lincoln was reelected by a comfortable margin, with 212 out of 233 electoral votes.|$|E
5|$|Vinícius Segalla from UOL said {{tax credits}} and BNDES {{resources}} are public money and that the concession of those resources to Corinthians are unclear. The federal government dismissed the notion, saying that tax credits are intended to encourage economical growth and work opportunities for the areas surrounding the stadia. The city government said tax credits are not subsidies and the stadium will be <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> the city, especially the east zone. They also said subsidies given to the Brazilian Grand Prix and Carnaval among others also bring benefits to the city. Public Prosecutor Marcelo Milani contested the validity of tax credits issued by the city and sued then-mayor Gilberto Kassab for R$1.74billion; the judges said Milani's case was without merit and dismissed it.|$|E

5|$|The Delaware State Highway Department (DSHD) {{was created}} on April 2, 1917 to {{construct}} and maintain a system of state highways across Delaware. As a result, the state took over construction of the DuPont Highway. The DuPont Highway was completed in 1923 when the final section near Odessa was finished. The DuPont Highway was <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> southern Delaware, which had formerly been economically isolated from the large cities of the northeast. In conjunction {{with the rise of}} the automobile, the highway spurred the growth of the Delaware Beaches by greatly improving access to the coast for tourists from northern Delaware and adjacent portions of the Northeast megalopolis. Southern Delaware also developed into a major truck farming region due to having much greater access to urban markets. No longer fully reliant on the railroads to transport their goods, farmers in Sussex and Kent counties could market their fruits, vegetables, and broiler chickens directly to consumers in the north. Also during this time, the State Aid Road Law ushered in a period of highway improvement in which the county would offer road bonds and the state would match. The DSHD would then improve the highway. Most of the highways improved by the DSHD were built as concrete roads, with sharp curves eliminated. The state also took over the last of the private turnpikes and converted them to free roads. In 1926, the state began eliminating several railroad grade crossings and in 1927 the first all-weather secondary roads were constructed, consisting of one concrete lane and one dirt lane in an effort to reduce costs.|$|E

25|$|Banana {{cultivation}} {{also proved}} <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> the region’s economy after the 1880s, expanding commercial agriculture and inducing thousands more to migrate.

25|$|According to the U.S., Iran {{could reduce}} the world price of crude {{petroleum}} by 10%, saving the United States annually $76 billion (at the proximate 2008 world oil price of $100/bbl).

25|$|Officials with Arlington County and {{the state}} of Virginia long debated whether to build new roads, which would be far more {{expensive}} yet <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> the local economy, or simply connect existing ones. Federal money became available for building approaches in 1933, four years into the Great Depression. The first connection with the bridge opened in October 1938; a second connection opened in 1942 to link it to the Pentagon road network.|$|E
50|$|The 28 km {{branch line}} to Canowindra was opened with great fanfare on 4 July 1910. The {{opening of the}} line proved <b>an</b> {{economic}} <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> the town, with Canowindra's population increasing from 400 prior to 1900, to 1500 and rising in 1911.|$|R

25|$|The {{battle for}} the Tidewater Railway's {{rights-of-way}} displayed Rogers at his most crafty and ingenious. He was able to persuade the leading citizens of Roanoke and Norfolk, both strongholds of the rival Norfolk and Western, that his new railroad would be <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> both communities, secretly securing crucial rights-of-way in the process. In 1907, {{the name of the}} Tidewater Railway was changed to The Virginian Railway Company, and it acquired the Deepwater Railway to form the needed West Virginia-Virginia link.|$|E
25|$|However, most cargo {{was still}} being sent {{downstream}} in the early 19th century, averaging 60,000 tons downstream to 6,500 tons upstream. Boats passing through still had to unload all of their cargo before navigating the falls, <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> local businesses. The frontier days quickly fading, log houses and forts began to disappear, and Louisville saw its first newspaper, the Louisville Gazette in 1807 and its first theatre in 1808, and the first dedicated church building in 1809. All of this reflected the 400% growth in population reported by the 1810 Census.|$|E
25|$|A fast-growing {{population}} and rapidly expanding {{economy in the}} Minot region has been <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> Minot International Airport, with annual passengers increasing from 66,000 in 2009 to 222,000 in 2013. This increase, as well the addition of three new airlines, has put tremendous strain on current airport facilities. The current passenger terminal was designed for {{less than half the}} passengers who currently use it. Accordingly, taxiway and runway improvements are being made and ground will soon be broken on a new terminal that can house three times as many gates as well as additional airlines, car rental facilities, and offer more amenities.|$|E
50|$|Election {{years are}} <b>a</b> major <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> {{commercial}} broadcasters, because virtually all political advertising is purchased with minimal advance planning, paying therefore the highest rates.

25|$|Until {{the launch}} of the Switch in 2017, the Nintendo 64 was the latest major home console to use the {{cartridge}} as its primary storage format, although most handheld systems (with the exception of the PlayStation Portable) continued to use cartridges. Most home systems began using disc, flash, and online formats. With the Nintendo GameCube, the company utilized the optical disc format instead of the cartridge format, in <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> some developers. The company's stated goal was to reduce manufacturing costs; Nintendo did not cite storage space as a rationale. While the new console lacks backwards compatibility with Nintendo 64 Game Paks, Nintendo said players could simply keep their Nintendo 64.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrival of}} the railway in 1869, which was opened on 27 May by the Governor Lord Belmore (an event commemorated by Belmore Park in {{the centre of the}} city), along with the {{completion}} of the line from Sydney to Albury in 1883, was <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> the city. Later branchlines were constructed to Cooma (opened in 1889) and later extended further to Nimmitabel and then to Bombala, and to Crookwell and Taralga. Goulburn became a major railway centre with a roundhouse and engine servicing facilities and a factory which made pre-fabricated concrete components for signal boxes and station buildings. The roundhouse is now a railway museum with steam, diesel and rolling stock exhibits.|$|E
25|$|In {{areas of}} {{suitable}} temperate climate, the survival traits of Africanized colonies help them outperform European honey bee colonies. They also return later and basically work under conditions that often keep European bees hive-bound. This {{is the reason}} why they have gained a well-deserved reputation as superior honey producers, and those beekeepers who have learned to adapt their management techniques now seem to prefer them to their European counterparts. Studies show that in areas of Florida that contain Africanized honey bees, the honey production is higher than in areas in which they do not live. It is also becoming apparent that Africanized bees have another advantage over European bees in that they seem to show a higher resistance to several health issues including parasites such as Varroa destructor, some fungal diseases like chalkbrood and even the mysterious colony-collapse disorder which is currently plaguing beekeepers. So despite all its negative factors, {{it is possible that the}} Africanized honey bee might actually end up being <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> apiculture.|$|E
