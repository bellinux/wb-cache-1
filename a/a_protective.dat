5|$|Bulk lead {{exposed to}} moist air forms <b>a</b> <b>protective</b> layer of varying composition. Lead {{carbonate}} {{is a common}} constituent; the sulfate or chloride may also be present in urban or maritime settings. This layer makes bulk lead effectively chemically inert in the air. Finely powdered lead, as with many metals, is pyrophoric, and burns with a bluish-white flame.|$|E
5|$|Chromium is {{also known}} for its luster when polished. It is used as <b>a</b> <b>protective</b> and {{decorative}} coating on car parts, plumbing fixtures, furniture parts and many other items, usually applied by electroplating. Chromium was used for electroplating as early as 1848, but this use only became widespread {{with the development of}} an improved process in 1924.|$|E

5|$|Helium {{is used as}} <b>a</b> <b>protective</b> gas {{in growing}} silicon and {{germanium}} crystals, in titanium and zirconium production, and in gas chromatography, because it is inert. Because of its inertness, thermally and calorically perfect nature, high speed of sound, and high value of the heat capacity ratio, it is also useful in supersonic wind tunnels and impulse facilities.|$|E
5|$|Most Hippeastrum bulbs are {{tunicate}} (<b>a</b> <b>protective</b> dry {{outer layer}} and fleshy concentric inner scales or leaf bases). The bulbs are generally between 512cm (2"5") {{in diameter and}} produce two to seven long-lasting evergreen or deciduous leaves that are 3090cm (12"36") long and 2.55cm (1"2") wide. The leaves are hysteranthous (develop after flowering), sessile, rarely persistent and subpetiolate.|$|E
30|$|Conclusions: NAC exerts <b>a</b> {{significant}} <b>protective</b> role in liver injury following IIR, {{which seems}} to be independent of <b>an</b> intestinal <b>protective</b> effect. Additional administration of NAC before reperfusion was of no further benefit. The most effective regimen among the compared regimens was that of 300  mg/kg before ischemia.|$|R

5|$|Plutonium–uranium–titanium and plutonium–uranium–zirconium were {{investigated}} {{for use as}} nuclear fuels. The addition of the third element increases corrosion resistance, reduces flammability, and improves ductility, fabricability, strength, and thermal expansion. Plutonium–uranium–molybdenum has the best corrosion resistance, forming <b>a</b> <b>protective</b> film of oxides, but titanium and zirconium are preferred for physics reasons.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland {{has existed}} {{as a state}} {{in its present form}} since the {{adoption}} of the Swiss Federal Constitution in 1848.

5|$|The lungs {{also serve}} <b>a</b> <b>protective</b> role. Several {{blood-borne}} substances, {{such as a}} few types of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, serotonin and bradykinin, are excreted through the lungs. Drugs and other substances can be absorbed, modified or excreted in the lungs. The lungs filter out small blood clots from veins and prevent them from entering arteries and causing strokes.|$|E

5|$|The wool {{quality of}} a Herdwick has unique qualities {{relating}} to durability.

30|$|The {{risk factors}} for a reduced {{long-term}} lung function in ARDS patients are unknown. <b>As</b> <b>protective</b> mechanical ventilation is an important intervention to reduce mortality of ARDS, probably by decreasing lung inflammation, we hypothesized that the parameters used during the ventilation strategy {{could be related to}} long-term lung fibrosis, impairing the lung function among ARDS survivors.|$|R
5|$|A {{cervical}} mucus plug, called the operculum, forms inside the cervical canal during pregnancy. This provides <b>a</b> <b>protective</b> seal for the uterus against {{the entry of}} pathogens and against leakage of uterine fluids. The mucus plug is also known to have antibacterial properties. This plug is released as the cervix dilates, either during {{the first stage of}} childbirth or shortly before. It is visible as a blood-tinged mucous discharge.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors can {{potentially}} {{increase the risk of}} developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can induce CYP2E1, thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less. Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists. For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have <b>a</b> <b>protective</b> effect. For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.|$|E
5|$|A virus particle, {{also known}} as a virion, {{consists}} of genes made from DNA or RNA which are surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>protective</b> coat of protein called a capsid. The capsid is made of many smaller, identical protein molecules which are called capsomers. The arrangement of the capsomers can either be icosahedral (20-sided), helical or more complex. There is an inner shell around the DNA or RNA called the nucleocapsid, which is formed by proteins. Some viruses are surrounded by a bubble of lipid (fat) called an envelope.|$|E

5|$|BAE Systems {{announced}} that, in December 2013, {{the company}} had test flown a Tornado equipped with parts that were made with 3D printing equipment. The parts included <b>a</b> <b>protective</b> cover for the radio, a landing-gear guard and air-intake door support struts. The test demonstrated the feasibility of making replacement parts quickly and cheaply at the air base hosting the Tornado. The company claimed that, {{with some of the}} parts costing less than £100 per piece to manufacture, 3D printing already resulted in savings of more than £300,000 and would offer further potential cost savings of more than £1.2million through 2017.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium is a soft, malleable, ductile, bluish-white {{divalent}} metal. It {{is similar}} in many respects to zinc but forms complex compounds.

As a bulk metal, cadmium is insoluble in water and is not flammable; however, in its powdered form it may burn and release toxic fumes.|$|E
