Scenes also feature the singer singing in a dark bedroom, looking out of a rainy window. He wears a suit and encounters a gang and <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> <b>bull</b> along the way.

5|$|The video {{opens with}} a fast motion night view of several skyscrapers located in Houston. It {{transitions}} to quick looks of various houses and people. Scenes filmed at the SLAB parade, an annual celebration of car culture in Houston were also featured in the clip set in slow motion. Houston residents posing for the camera are featured throughout the video as well as scenes of children playing football. During several scenes, Beyoncé is seen lip-syncing the song wearing a white-hooded fur mink coat and a matching one piece {{in front of a}} tumbledown house holding <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> <b>bull</b> on a leash. This scene was filmed in the suburb of Brunswick, during her Melbourne, Australia part of The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour and is the only scene from the music video, to be filmed outside of Houston. During another scene, she is seen wearing a jersey of the Houston Rockets with number 13, by James Harden. Beyoncé also appears at a gas station filling the fuel tank of a car and later goes to the streets in it.|$|E

25|$|The {{breeding}} {{history of}} Pit Bulls {{makes it impossible}} to rule out a violent propensity for any one dog as gameness and aggressiveness can be hidden for years.

25|$|In American Canine Federation and Florence Vianzon v.

The court rejected each of these claims based on existing legal precedents and upheld the city's ordinance.|$|E
25|$|In Cochrane v.

She also argued that a provision allowing the Crown to introduce as evidence a veterinarian's certificate certifying that the dog is <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> <b>bull</b> violates the right to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence.|$|E

The trial court issued a temporary injunction {{against the city}} and accepted motions for summary judgment from both the dog owners and the city. The court decided {{in favor of the}} city and lifted the injunction, whereupon the dog owners appealed to the Washington Supreme Court {{on the grounds that the}} ordinance was vague because a person of ordinary intelligence could not tell what was prohibited, and that the trial court had improperly decided the summary judgment in favor of the city.|$|E

25|$|In Holt v. City of Maumelle, 817 S.W.2d 208 (AR., 1991), Mr. Steele Holt {{sued the}} city of Maumelle, Arkansas in 1988 {{in an attempt to}} have its {{prohibition}} against pit bulls overturned {{on the grounds that the}} ordinance was impermissibly vague, that it was unreasonable to ban pit bull-type dogs, and that the city's Board of Directors committed a breach of contract by passing <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> <b>bull</b> ordinance that it had previously agreed to forego; Mr. Holt also asked that the city pay compensatory damages, punitive damages, and his attorney's fees. The Pulaski County circuit court made a summary judgment dismissing the suit, and Mr. Holt appealed. In 1991, the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the circuit court's decision, finding that the pit bull ordinance was not impermissibly vague, that the restrictions were reasonable, and that any agreement made by the city to limit its own legislative powers was null and void since the city's first duty was to protect the public interest.|$|E
500|$|Her second children's book is {{the story}} of <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> <b>bull,</b> named after Peters' dog Stella. The {{character}} would rather be a pig ballerina, but she learns to accept herself. Titled Stella is a Star, the book includes a CD with an original song written and performed by Peters and was released in April 2010 by Blue Apple Books. [...] According to Publishers Weekly, [...] "Turning the pages to Peters' spirited narration, which is provided in an accompanying CD, makes for a more rewarding reading experience. The story and disc end with a sneakily affecting self-esteem anthem, which, like the familiar tale itself, is buoyed by the author's lovely vocals." [...] Peters introduced the book at a reading and signing where she also sang part of the song, at the L.A. Times Festival of Books, Los Angeles, California, on April 24, 2010.|$|E

There was a surprisingly balanced and incredibly lovely tone." [...] All three writers of The Atlantic review praised the mash-up: Patrick Burns said it was beautiful, and noted that [...] "the arrangement was clever, the ladies sounded great, and the song was placed perfectly into the plot of two characters who were restored a bit of their depth in this episode", Brown stated that the song was lovely, and Kevin Fallon felt that it was [...] "unexpectedly gorgeous and haunting", and noted that it was [...] "yet another example of how skilled the music directors are at these mash-ups." [...] Semigran felt that it was the best performance of the night, and TV Line Michael Slezak gave the piece an [...] "A", and said that it was a [...] "vocally and visually stunning set piece for the unlikeliest of duet partners." [...] Flandez commented that the song [...] "floated like gossamer between Rachel and Quinn as they beautifully poured the sentiments of ugly ducklings", and Futterman wrote, [...] "It's a poignant moment, and the inclusion of West Side Story 'I Feel Pretty' makes for a great pop/theater mash-up that reminds us of what Glee is at its heart." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{story and}} the {{photographs}} circulated the Internet, including various cryptozoology blogs, with {{a great amount of}} speculation about possible explanations. A video showing the original photographs, as well as some footage of the further decomposed corpse, became very popular on the web, being one of the most viewed videos {{over the course of a}} day. In addition to its prevalence on the Internet, the story was covered on television and radio. Comparisons were drawn to the Montauk Monster found in Montauk, New York in June 2008. A popular theory was that the Panama Creature was a sloth (perhaps an albino) that had somehow became hairless; proponents of the hypothesis cited the hooked claw visible in one of the photographs. Science author Darren Naish, writing for ScienceBlogs, supported the sloth hypothesis, but had a [...] "difficult time" [...] explaining the creature's hairlessness. The sloth theory was generally considered most credible; in 1996, similar photographs were taken of a creature found on the coast between Panama and Costa Rica that was later confirmed to be a sloth that had started to decay. Further Internet speculation led to some proposing that it was in fact a dolphin or <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> <b>bull</b> terrier, an example of a species previously unknown to science, or some sort of genetic mutation. Some Panamanian zoologists said that it appeared to be a fetus of some kind. In addition to naturalistic explanations, Billy Booth of About.com reported that [...] "there has been speculation that it is alien, and thereby the connection to UFOs, undersea bases, the whole ball of wax".|$|E
500|$|The {{title is}} a takeoff on Straight Outta Compton, an album by N.W.A. Lynwood, California, Yankovic's home town, is a {{neighboring}} community to Compton, California. [...] The cover art, inspired by [...] "gangsta imagery", depicts Yankovic, wearing a Lynwood, California, letterman's jacket and holding <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> <b>bull</b> on a leash, {{in front of}} a Chevrolet. All of the images from the album were taken on April 22, 2006, by Michael Blackwell, an Atlanta, Georgia, photographer who has also taken images of notable hip hop stars as T.I., Lil' Scrappy, and Young Jeezy. The pit bull on the cover is named Dough Boy, and is owned by a local couple that was walking by during the photo shoot. Yankovic had always planned for this album to be titled Straight Outta Lynwood, even when the lead single was going to be [...] "You're Pitiful"; Yankovic had liked the ironic juxtaposition of having a gangsta rap-inspired album cover and title, with [...] "such a toothless ballad for the lead parody". However, the cover ended up being unintentionally appropriate when [...] "White & Nerdy" [...] became the lead track on the album. The numbers and letters on the album cover have several meanings: [...] "NLY" [...] are the initials of both Yankovic's daughter and his father. The number [...] "27" [...] is an in-joke with Yankovic's fans, but February 7 was also his mother's birthday. The license plate originally read [...] "27 4LIFE" [...] during the photo shoot. The photograph that was originally going to be the cover was later used for the back of the CD case.|$|E
