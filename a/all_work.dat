I think that <b>all</b> <b>works</b> in metal, <b>all</b> <b>works</b> in clay, <b>all</b> <b>works</b> in carved wood, should be included. Of course, that involves much.

5|$|A fairly strong easterly {{wind had}} been blowing for three days; {{on the evening}} of the third day, the mosquitos arrived, flying high, about fifty feet, and looking like a cloud of mist over Carancahua Bay. At the ranch, they set {{everything}} on fire that had blood in it, and <b>all</b> <b>work</b> was suspended by unanimous consent...little or nothing was done for nearly five days; by this time the main body had passed, though plenty remained to make everything uncomfortable for about two weeks. This migration was from east to west and the line was about three miles wide.|$|E
5|$|After the February Revolution, the {{condition}} of the ships was assessed on 28 April 1917. The ship that was furthest along was the Ismail: her hull, engines, and boilers were around 65% complete, and her armour was 36% complete. Her turrets, however, were not expected to be completed until 1919. The Congress of Shipyard Workers decided to continue work on the Izmail in mid-1917, but only to provide jobs. The Provisional Government halted <b>all</b> <b>work</b> on Borodino, Kinburn, and Navarin on 24 October 1917, and the Soviet Supreme Naval College ordered work on Izmail halted on 14 December 1917.|$|E
5|$|<b>All</b> <b>work</b> {{to put the}} I-185 into {{production}} was cancelled afterwards, even with the M-82 engine, as they were all required for the La-5 fighter. Another reason cited was that the La-5 used the fuselage of the Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Goudkov LaGG-3 which was already in production in three plants and would involve less disruption of the production lines. Another factor may have been that the La-5 required less duralumin to build, something in short supply at the time.|$|E

5|$|Because {{there were}} no deaths and only 65 people had been {{directly}} affected by Cyclone Daman, the Fijian government, {{with the help of}} the Red Cross, decided not to request any International Aid or any external assistance. The Fijian Government, on January 15, 2008, allocated $530,000 2008FJD for the relief and rehabilitation programme of Cikobia. By August 2008, <b>all</b> <b>work</b> rebuilding Cikobia after Cyclone Daman had been completed.|$|E
5|$|By early 1943, {{the ship}} had been {{sufficiently}} repaired to begin the conversion process, but Hitler, angered {{by the failure of}} German surface raiders at the Battle of the Barents Sea in December 1942 ordered the cessation of <b>all</b> <b>work.</b> Gneisenau was disarmed and her 28cm and 15cm gun turrets were used in shore batteries. Turret Caesar was installed in a coastal fortress in Trondheim as the coastal battery Orlandet.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{called his}} ideas Nai Talim (literally, 'new education'). He {{believed}} that the Western style education violated and destroyed the indigenous cultures.

5|$|In November 1989, Jenks {{resident}} Gary Medlin and two Jenks city councilmen {{drafted a}} letter to OTA requesting that the agency cease <b>all</b> <b>work</b> on the Creek Turnpike.

5|$|Members of <b>all</b> <b>work</b> {{units were}} {{continuously}} beaten by {{the guards and}} often shot or hanged at the gallows. Only the strongest men were selected from new arrivals daily to obtain the necessary replacements. There were other work details which had no contact with the transports: the Holzfällerkommando ("woodcutter unit") cut and chopped firewood, and the Tarnungskommando ("disguise unit") camouflaged the structures of the camp. Another work detail was responsible for cleaning the common areas. The Camp 1 Wohnlager residential compound contained barracks for about 700 Sonderkommandos which, when combined with the 300 Totenjuden living across from the gas chambers, brought their grand total to roughly one thousand at a time.|$|E
5|$|Pigeonhole sort, {{counting}} sort, radix sort, and Van Emde Boas tree sorting <b>all</b> <b>work</b> {{best when}} the key size is small; for large enough keys, they become slower than comparison sorting algorithms. However, when the key size or the word size is very large {{relative to the}} number of items (or equivalently when the number of items is small), it may again become possible to sort quickly, using different algorithms that take advantage of the parallelism inherent in the ability to perform arithmetic operations on large words.|$|E

5|$|Production at Site S ceased in late 1945 due to {{the cold}} weather. <b>All</b> <b>work</b> was then done at Salt Wells. The plant was {{completed}} in January 1946, and all equipment was installed and working by May 1946. Work was initially dogged by an unacceptably large number of defects {{in the form of}} cracks or imperfections in the explosive blocks. The core of the problem was that the techniques used at Los Alamos did not scale to a production site, so different methods were required. Special instrumentation was devised by Caltech's Ira Bowen to assess the quality of the explosive blocks.|$|E
5|$|Rhodri Morgan, Assembly Member (AM) {{replaced}} Alun Michael AM, {{to become}} the First Secretary (now known as the First Minister) of the National Assembly on 15 February 2000. On 22 March, Morgan stopped <b>all</b> <b>work</b> on the project {{to carry out a}} complete review. The decision to stop the project was supported by a vote in the National Assembly on 6 April 2000. The review included the costs and construction risks of the new building, the timetable for the completion of the project and consideration of possible alternatives to the new building.|$|E

5|$|The X-10 semiworks {{operated}} as a plutonium {{production plant}} until January 1945, {{when it was}} turned over to research activities. By this time, 299 batches of irradiated slugs had been processed. A radioisotope building, a steam plant, and other structures were added in April 1946 to support the laboratory's peacetime educational and research missions. <b>All</b> <b>work</b> was completed by December 1946, adding another $1,009,000 to the cost of construction at X-10, and bringing the total cost to $13,041,000.

5|$|The initial {{attempts}} to return Frunze to service were to restore her to original design, but money ran out {{before she was}} even half completed. Subsequent plans that focused on reconstructing her as a modernized equivalent to her sisters or even as a battlecruiser, with one turret deleted to save weight, were considered, but finally abandoned on 23 January 1935 when <b>all</b> <b>work</b> was stopped.|$|E
5|$|The new DM-15B Nike Zeus B (the earlier model retroactively {{becoming}} the A) received a go ahead for development on 16 January 1958, the same date the Air Force was officially told to stop <b>all</b> <b>work</b> on a Wizard missile. On 22 January 1958, the National Security Council gave Zeus S-Priority, the highest national priority. Additional funds were requested to the Zeus program to ensure an initial service {{date in the}} fourth quarter of 1962, but these were denied, delaying service entry until some time in 1963.|$|E
