50|$|Some Florida {{politicians}} {{vowed never}} to eliminate the electric chair despite the debate, but events rapidly changed after the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal from the Florida Supreme Court's split decision upholding electrocution. This action shocked some in Florida's leadership. The nation's high court had declined to review appeals after the prior three malfunctions, so observers concluded that the nation's high court now had come to view Florida's death penalty problems more dimly. Partly on the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> Attorney General Butterworth, Florida's Governor Jeb Bush summoned the legislature into special session and in early 2000 it quickly approved lethal injection as the means <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> that must be used unless the inmate requests electrocution. The Attorney General then notified the Federal court and it agreed to dismiss the case based on the change in law.|$|R

40|$|Article 27 - 2 of the Penal Code in Japan {{requires}} that `partial suspension <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> the sentence' {{should be judged}} in view of `the necessity and appropriateness of preventing re-offending'. Some, on the other hand, argue that `partial suspension <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> the sentence' should be "balanced" with the criminal responsibility of the offender, which is greater than that <b>of</b> those whose <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> the sentence is fully suspended and is smaller than that of those whose sentence is partially executed. However, I think that this method of judgment ignores the requirements of Article 27 - 2, simply imposing the `penalty' in the community, which has no desirable effect on the offender's rehabilitation. Furthermore, such method of judgment might assign a longer `penalty' to the offender whose sentence had been fully executed with short or no parole term, because of his/her criminal responsibility. In this paper, I reconsider the discussion on `partial suspension <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> the sentence' and `full suspension <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> the sentence' in order to clarify the image of those whose sentence is `partially suspended' under Article 27 - 2. Through this process, I argue that `partial suspension <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> the sentence' should be determined with sufficient consideration of `the necessity and appropriateness of preventing reoffending...|$|R
