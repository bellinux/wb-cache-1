25|$|Reciprocal space {{methods have}} been used {{extensively}} {{for their ability to}} evaluate enormous numbers of configurations. They lose their speed advantage if torsional changes are introduced. <b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it is impossible to make efficient use of prior knowledge. The question also remains whether convolutions are too limited a class of scoring function to identify the best complex reliably.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} problem with blocking all scripts on all websites by default is substantial reduction in functionality and responsiveness (client-side scripting {{can be much}} faster than server-side scripting {{because it does not}} need to connect to a remote server and the page or frame {{does not need to be}} reloaded). Another problem with script blocking is that many users do not understand it, and do not know how to properly secure their browsers. Yet <b>another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> many sites do not work without client-side scripting, forcing users to disable protection for that site and opening their systems to vulnerabilities. The Firefox NoScript extension enables users to allow scripts selectively from a given page while disallowing others on the same page. For example, scripts from example.com could be allowed, while scripts from advertisingagency.com that are attempting to run on the same page could be disallowed.|$|E
500|$|<b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> tablebases {{require a}} lot of memory to store the many {{thousands}} of positions. The Nalimov tablebases, which use advanced compression techniques, require 7.05GB of hard disk space for all five-piece endings. The six-piece endings require approximately 1.2TB. The seven-piece Lomonosov tablebase requires 140 TB of storage space.|$|E
40|$|The {{gestation}} period of this volume took more time still than feared. The time I could spend on Pacific Plant Areas, now officially {{recognized as a}} project of the Rijksherbarium, was limited to a few days per month. But for the help of several persons as mentioned in the Acknowledgements the completion of this volume would have taken even longer. <b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I <b>was</b> deprived of the help of Mrs. Van Steenis, in compiling the bibliography of published maps. This has compelled me to take some time-saving measures. A complete explanation of the bibliography and of the maps {{can be found in}} the introductions to previous volumes, but some words on the present bibliography are perhaps in order...|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the gun <b>was</b> fed by 20-round {{strips of}} cartridges. This limited {{continuous}} fire, as the gun {{could only be}} fired rapidly when a second crew member fed in one ammunition strip after another. The rounds still had to be oiled to stop the cases sticking in the chamber, with all the disadvantages this entailed. Another peculiarity of the design <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the spent cases were reinserted in the strip as each round was fired. The mechanical energy required to perform this function substantially reduced the rate of fire, and the weapon tended to jam whenever a case was reinserted even slightly out of line. It also meant that in the event the metal clips had to be reused, the gunner's assistant had to first remove the empty cases from the strips.|$|R
5000|$|The {{synchronization}} {{with the}} X Server was done through signals and a shared memory buffer called the SAREA. The {{access to the}} DRM device was exclusive, so any DRI client had to lock it {{at the beginning of}} a rendering operation. Other users of the device [...] - including the X Server - [...] were blocked in the meantime, and they had to wait until the lock was released at the end of the current rendering operation, even if it wouldn't be any conflict between both operations. <b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> operations didn't retain memory allocations after the current DRI process released its lock on the device, so any data uploaded to the graphics memory such as textures were lost for upcoming operations, causing a significant impact on graphics performance.|$|R
60|$|The {{style of}} the work is as {{imposing}} as his great subject. Indeed, with almost any other subject the sonorous roll of his majestic sentences would be out of place. While it deserves all the adjectives that have been applied to it by enthusiastic admirers,--finished, elegant, splendid, rounded, massive, sonorous, copious, elaborate, ornate, exhaustive,--it must be confessed, though one whispers the confession, that the style sometimes obscures our interest in the narrative. As he sifted his facts from a multitude of sources, so he often hides them again in endless periods, and one must often sift them out again in order to be quite sure of even the simple facts. <b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Gibbon is hopelessly worldly in his point of view; he loves pageants and crowds rather than individuals, and he is lacking in enthusiasm and in spiritual insight. The result is so frankly material at times that one wonders if he is not reading of forces or machines, rather than of human beings. A little reading of his History here and there is an excellent thing, leaving one impressed with the elegant classical style and the scholarship; but a continued reading is very apt to leave us longing for simplicity, for naturalness, and, above all, for the glow of enthusiasm which makes the dead heroes live once more in the written pages.|$|E
50|$|One {{drawback}} of {{the electric}} roasting appliances is their small capacity: 4 to 8 oz for fluid-bed, and somewhat more for drum roaster. They are also expensive. <b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> most models emit smoke.|$|E
50|$|A major {{drawback}} {{is the lack}} of support for Unicode, which makes it impossible to enter Asian DVD titles correctly. <b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> after years of fully functional ad-supported versions, from version 3.0 onwards, users cannot use most features with collections over 50 discs without buying the software.|$|E
50|$|Camp {{residents}} {{were allowed to}} leave the camp with permission to pursue jobs. However, many {{did not want to}} leave without the guarantees of food and a place to stay. <b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> to <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the process of getting a leave clearance was slow, causing some to lose interest. The draft and registration processes also complicated getting a leave clearance.|$|R
500|$|When Kaga {{was being}} designed, {{the problem of}} how to deal with exhaust gases in carrier {{operations}} had not been resolved. The swiveling funnels of [...] had not proved successful and wind-tunnel testing had not provided an answer. As a result, Akagi and Kaga were given different exhaust systems to evaluate in real-world conditions. Kagas funnel gases were collected in a pair of long horizontal ducts which discharged at the rear of each side of the flight deck, in spite of predictions by a number of prominent naval architects that they would not keep the hot gases away from the flight deck. The predictions proved to be correct, not least because Kaga was slower than the Akagi which allowed the gases to rise and interfere with landing operations. <b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the heat of the gases made the crew's quarters located on the side of the ship by the funnels almost uninhabitable.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> of waxing <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{some people}} {{experience}} ingrown hairs, red bumps, and minor bleeding. This {{is more likely}} to occur when waxing areas with thick hair, especially the first few times when follicles are strongest.|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} delay caused by protocol or satellites is significant enough that significant aircraft separations are required. The cost {{of using the}} satellite channel leads to less frequent updates. <b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> no other aircraft can benefit from the transmitted information as ACARS information is not re-broadcast from ground facilities to other aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Reciprocal space {{methods have}} been used {{extensively}} {{for their ability to}} evaluate enormous numbers of configurations. They lose their speed advantage if torsional changes are introduced. <b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it is impossible to make efficient use of prior knowledge.

5000|$|Although differing {{somewhat}} {{from the}} movie script, and drawing on the original comic, Anderson still noted that [...] "And of course <b>another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I have {{to stick to the}} script exactly as it is, even if I might have different ideas"; as such, the end result is much closer to the film than the comic or a third, independent story.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{benefit for}} this type of file system <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> {{centralized}} and easy to remove. A single-file virtual file system may include all the basic features expected of any file system (virtual or otherwise), but access to the internal structure of these file systems is often limited to programs specifically written {{to make use of the}} single-file virtual file system (instead of implementation through a driver allowing universal access). <b>Another</b> major <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> performance <b>is</b> relatively low when compared to other virtual file systems. Low performance is mostly due to the cost of shuffling virtual files when data is written or deleted from the virtual file system.|$|R
30|$|The same {{drawbacks}} which {{exist for}} the photogrammetry solution also are relevant for the photographic reconstruction, i.e. namely the sensitivity against light. <b>Another</b> major <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> while the data look visual attractive it is not suitable to take 3 D measurements {{due to the lack}} of metric information. This means that in contrast to laser scanning and photogrammetry spatial analysis starting with basic measurements of distances to further analysis such as the roughness of surfaces is not possible. In addition, while the point cloud based on photographic reconstruction may not show so many holes such as point clouds from laser scanners or photogrammetry, it does not mean <b>that</b> they <b>are</b> not there. They are more difficult to spot in the rendering because the human eye is able to interpolate where there maybe issues present.|$|R
40|$|Randomised {{controlled}} trials (RCTs) can be {{an invaluable}} tool in determining the best treatment for patients. However if undertaken incorrectly they can lead to further confusion. They are the cornerstone of evidence based medicine. In the early 1990 s there was rising concerns {{about the quality of}} RCTs. The reporting patterns were of variable quality. It was increasingly being recognised that many trials lacked methodology clarity. <b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> trials <b>were</b> not reported in a uniform manner which made subsequent metanalysis difficult. RCTs are expensive both in terms of time and resources and it is important to maximise the benefits that can accrue. When correctly performed they can lead to significant changes in clinical practice and improved patient care. Negative findings are equally as important as positive findings in this regard. In 1993 a group consisting of medical journal editors, epidemiologists and methodologists met in Ottawa with the aim of producing a new template for the assessment of the quality of RCTs. Three years later in 1996 the original CONSORT statement was published. It was subsequently revised in 2001. It is now widely accepted by many medical journals. 1 It is a guide for authors when reporting an RCT. In addition it gives guidance to editors and peer reviewers. The term which stands for Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials was introduced in order {{to improve the quality of}} RCTs. The idea behind CONSORT <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the reporting of an RCT should meet a basic uniform standard. CONSORT does not include directives about designing, conducting and analysing trials. It concentrates on reporting what was done and what was found. It has brought about improvements. An assessment of 616 RCTs in 2006 was compared with a corresponding number of RCTs in 2000. It <b>was</b> concluded <b>that</b> the quality of reporting had improved. ...|$|R
50|$|One {{downside}} to 2.4 GHz is that precautions {{must be taken}} during installation since certain materials such as carbon fiber can mask the signal. In some cases, satellite receivers with secondary antennas need {{to be used to}} maintain better line-of-sight with the transmitter radio. <b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a 2.4 GHz standard has yet to evolve so that receivers and transmitters can be mixed regardless of their respective manufacturer.|$|E
50|$|The {{drawback}} {{is that the}} guest OS has to be compatible with the host CPU. So unlike an emulator, one cannot use twoOStwo to run classic Mac OS/PowerPC software on an Intel x86 processor. <b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it is not normally possible to efficiently nest virtual machines. Finally, although twoOStwo virtual machines run in user mode, twoOStwo itself requires installing various device drivers in the host operating system.|$|E
50|$|There are {{disadvantages}} {{with the}} single shot approach. The coil design can be an extremely complex and involved process. Often the use of ferrite or laminated loading materials is required to influence the magnetic field concentrations in given areas thereby to refine the heat pattern produced. <b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> much more power is required due to the increased surface area being heated compared with a traverse approach.|$|E
30|$|Based on today’s AECO {{industry}} {{expectations and}} government mandates, many educational institutions {{across the globe}} are investigating how to incorporate BIM in TESs (Becker et al. 2011; Salman 2014; Rooney 2015). In addition, globally active BIM educationalists and researchers have invested huge efforts in delivering BIM educational frameworks, designing BIM curricula, conducting BIM courses, and developing new strategies for overcoming the obstacles faced during BIM implementation. Relatedly, a few BIM educationalists and researchers have delivered overviews of BIM educational trends in the past (Barison & Santos 2010 c, 2011; Wong et al. 2011; Lee & Dossick 2012). Recently, NATSPEC, a non-profit organization published {{an update on the}} state of BIM awareness and adoption in countries such as the USA, Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, the UK, South Africa, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. NATSPEC’s study revealed that BIM education and its uptake are still at different levels of implementation across the globe, and provided an outline declaring that current BIM education tends to focus on the use of particular BIM software. In the end, NATSPEC’s report emphasized the need for education connected to open BIM, BIM management, and a collaborative working environment for them (Rooney 2015). Open BIM and BIM management in academic BIM education refers to educating AECO students on how students of different disciplines need to collaboratively design, construct, and operate buildings based on open standards and workflows. However, NATSPEC’s study failed to document completely the status of BIM education and awareness in each country. <b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the report <b>was</b> purely based on the responses provided by a global group of parties with an interest in BIM. Moreover, no recent efforts have been undertaken by BIM researchers to review and analyze the latest BIM publications in order to provide an overview of the state of BIM education worldwide.|$|R
40|$|Maps {{are used}} in many {{application}} areas to support the visualization and analysis of geo-referenced data. The geometry used in those maps is usually associated with the administrative subdivisions of the regions, disregarding {{the purpose of the}} analysis. <b>Another</b> common <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> traditional classification methods for data analysis, used for example in Geographic Information Systems, divide the data in a pre-defined number of classes. This can lead to a situation where a class integrates values <b>that</b> <b>are</b> very different from each other and that do not allow the identification of the main differences that can exist between regions. This paper presents a different approach for geo-referenced data analysis <b>that</b> <b>is</b> based on clustering analysis. Through a clustering process it is possible to analyse a specific data set with a map, employing a Space Model, which suits the purposes of such an analysis. Space Models are new geometries of the space <b>that</b> <b>are</b> created to emphasize particularities of the analysed data...|$|R
30|$|In drawing {{conclusions}} it {{is important}} to note that the three lightest animals were female, and the three heaviest male. It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> some of the differences observed are gender related, and the bodyweight effects are driven extrinsically through those gender differences. Given the size of this study these effects cannot be drawn out here, but may warrant further investigation. Also one of the female dogs was only 10  months old and was likely not mature at the time of the MRI evaluation. <b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> the fact <b>that</b> cartilage thickness <b>was</b> not directly measured but approximated by assuming everything is a sphere and calculating the radii based on surface area and volume calculations.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{defining}} language semantics through a reference implementation also has several potential drawbacks. Chief {{among them is}} that it conflates limitations of the reference implementation with properties of the language. For example, if the reference implementation has a bug, then that bug must {{be considered to be}} an authoritative behavior. <b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> programs written in this language may rely on quirks in the reference implementation, hindering portability across different implementations.|$|E
5000|$|One {{drawback}} of {{this method}} is that the prototype must be present in all files that use the function. <b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if the return type or arguments of the function are changed, these prototypes {{will have to be}} updated. Putting the prototype in a single, separate file avoids these problems. Assuming the prototype is moved to the file , the second source file can then become:#include [...] "add.h"int triple(int x){ return add(x, add(x,x));} ...|$|E
50|$|Combined {{heat and}} power systems are very useful systems in which wood waste, such as wood chips, {{is used to}} {{generate}} power, and heat is created as a byproduct of the power generation system. They {{have a very high}} cost because of the high pressure operation. Because of this high pressure operation, the need for a highly trained operator is mandatory, and will raise the cost of operation. <b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> while they produce electricity they will produce heat, and if producing heat is not desirable for certain parts of the year, the addition of a cooling tower is necessary, and will also raise the cost.|$|E
5000|$|Filtering systems - An {{information}} {{filtering system}} <b>is</b> a system <b>that</b> removes redundant information from an information stream before presenting it {{to a human}} user. The purpose of these systems is to manage information overload so that users can find more immediately helpful information. An example {{of this would be}} news feeds on various platforms. A notebook filter, for instance, allows users to select features to narrow down the list of displayed products. However, filters such as these require the user to have prior knowledge of the domain and the features <b>that</b> <b>are</b> available to select. <b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> the potential <b>that</b> a user could encounter zero results through the filtering system.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> of ELF <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the ELF {{band has}} very small bandwidth, and {{therefore}} can only transmit very simple messages, very slowly. ELF signals cannot carry audio (voice) like other types of radio, and can only carry short text messages consisting of a few letters. The US Navy system (above) reportedly uses three-letter code groups and requires 15 minutes to transmit one group. So current systems {{are not used to}} transmit detailed orders, but serve a [...] "bell ringer" [...] function, to order a specific vessel to surface and receive further orders by ordinary radio or satellite communication.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Automatic text {{categorization}} is {{an important}} component in many information organization and management tasks. Many researches have shown that similarity based categorization algorithms like K-nearest neighbour (KNN) are very effective in document categorization. These algorithms use index terms to represent documents. However some drawbacks persecute these algorithms. One major <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they tend to use all features when computing the similarities, which implies that they must search in a high-dimensional space. <b>Another</b> major <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they tend to use a very large training document set so that all terms, which are important to identify content of documents, are covered. To overcome these drawbacks, in this paper, we present a novel method to search for the optimal representation in a domain ontology hierarchical structure to reflect concepts for the taxonomic standard for pre-defined categories. Experiments have shown this is a feasible method to reduce the dimensionality of the document vector space effectively and reasonably and consequently improves the generalisation power of the derived classifier. The result is a classification method which is both very significantly less costly, in computation terms, and yet of considerably higher accuracy than comparable methods...|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> tablebases {{require a}} lot of memory to store the many {{thousands}} of positions. The Nalimov tablebases, which use advanced compression techniques, require 7.05 GB of hard disk space for all five-piece endings. The six-piece endings require approximately 1.2 TB. The seven-piece Lomonosov tablebase requires 140 TB of storage space. Some computers play better overall if their memory is devoted instead to the ordinary search and evaluation function. Modern engines analyze far enough ahead conventionally to handle the elementary endgames without needing tablebases (i.e. without suffering from the horizon effect). It is only in more complicated endgames that tablebases will have any significant effect on an engine's performance.|$|E
50|$|With the {{hitherto}} prevalent disk-based technology, data {{is loaded}} {{on to the}} computer's hard disk {{in the form of}} multiple tables and multi-dimensional structures against which queries are run. Disk based technologies are Relational Database Management Systems (RDMS), often based on the structured query language (SQL), such as SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle and many others. RDMS are designed for the requirements of transactional processing. Using a database that supports insertions and updates as well as performing aggregations, joins (typical in BI solutions) are typically very slow. <b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> SQL is designed to efficiently fetch rows of data, while BI queries usually involve fetching of partial rows of data involving heavy calculations.|$|E
50|$|One {{drawback}} of {{the design}} is the production line difficulty in mating the two drivers, and in replacing or reconing the woofer. <b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the low frequencies tend to modulate the high frequencies, causing greater intermodulation distortion. The Tannoy style of coaxial, with the woofer forming part of the high frequency horn, had greater intermodulation distortion. Designs similar to the Altec 604 have further problems with diffraction of the low frequencies around the central horn, and with rearward emanations from the horn body reflected forward by the woofer out of time with direct sound. All {{of the problems with}} sound waves tend to increase with sound pressure level, causing significant shifts in tone as the loudspeaker changes volume.|$|E
30|$|Although other {{analytic}} fit functions, such as bi- or tri-exponential functions, {{are known}} to better fit the time-activity curves [40, 41], these options were not implemented in the software. Moreover, the Dosimetry Toolkit® software has a limited set of segmentation tools, is not user-friendly, and not optimal. <b>Another</b> major <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this software cannot save the images and volumes of interest in Dicom format {{from the beginning to}} the end of the process. For example, it is not possible to change organ delineation after the process. In addition, the Dosimetry Toolkit® software is associated with a specific gamma camera by a license system. The software only accepts images obtained with a gamma camera with a known license number. Consequently, imaging data obtained with other gamma cameras cannot be used. However, new solutions are commercially available with user-friendly tools for segmentation, including those commonly used for EBRT (such as Boolean operators, easy manual, semi-automatic, automatic segmentation options…) and for nuclear medicine. These software programs also propose a wide choice of interpolation methods to better fit the obtained time-activity data.|$|R
40|$|This note {{analyzes}} {{the impacts of}} the fragmentation of economics into different schools of thought and of social science into the sub-disciplines economics, sociology and psychology. Fragmentation {{is based on the}} assumption <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> possible to split the set of an individual's behavioural motives into separable and disjoint subsets. However, this assumption runs counter to the insights in psychology. Moreover, even if splitting up were possible, the different subsets of motives finally need to be checked on consistency and weighted so as to obtain a comprehensive description and explanation. <b>Another</b> serious <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> specification of empirical models on the basis of one school of thought or one sub-discipline leads to omitted variables bias and hence biased estimators and tests. Finally, fragmentation may lead to a 'pick-and-mix package', whereby policy-makers and politicians feel free to use what suits them. The social rationality model together with the methodological approach prevalent in modern sociology is presented as a framework for integrating the schools of thought in economics and the social science sub-disciplines.

50|$|The first {{widely used}} method of color {{photography}} was the Autochrome plate, a process inventors and brothers Auguste and Louis Lumière {{began working on}} in the 1890s and commercially introduced in 1907. It was based on one of Louis Ducos du Hauron's ideas: instead of taking three separate photographs through color filters, take one through a mosaic of tiny color filters overlaid on the emulsion and view the results through an identical mosaic. If the individual filter elements were small enough, the three primary colors of red, blue, and green would blend together {{in the eye and}} produce the same additive color synthesis as the filtered projection of three separate photographs. Autochrome plates had an integral mosaic filter layer with roughly five million previously dyed potato grains per square inch added to the surface. Then {{through the use of a}} rolling press, five tons of pressure were used to flatten the grains, enabling every one of them to capture and absorb color and their microscopic size allowing the illusion <b>that</b> the colors <b>are</b> merged together. The final step was adding a coat of the light capturing substance silver bromide after which a color image could be imprinted and developed. In order to see it, reversal processing was used to develop each plate into a transparent positive <b>that</b> could <b>be</b> viewed directly or projected with an ordinary projector. One of the drawbacks of the technology is an exposure time of at least a second was required during the day in bright light and the worse the light is, the time required quickly goes up. An indoor portrait required a few minutes with the subject not being able to move or else the picture would come out blurry. This was because the grains absorbed the color fairly slowly and that a filter of a yellowish-orange color was added to the plate to keep the photograph from coming out excessively blue. Although necessary, the filter had the effect of reducing the amount of light <b>that</b> <b>was</b> absorbed. <b>Another</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the film could only be enlarged so much until the many dots that make up the image become apparent.|$|R
