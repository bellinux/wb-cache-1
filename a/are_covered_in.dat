5|$|This article {{compares the}} {{properties}} of brains across {{the entire range of}} animal species, with the greatest attention to vertebrates. It deals with the human brain insofar as it shares {{the properties of}} other brains. The ways in which the human brain differs from other brains <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> the human brain article. Several topics that might be covered here are instead covered there because much more can be said about them in a human context. The most important is brain disease and the effects of brain damage, that <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> the human brain article.|$|E
5|$|Unlike modern amphibians, many temnospondyls <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> small, closely packed scales. The undersides of most temnospondyls <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> rows {{of large}} ventral plates. During {{early stages of}} development, they first have only small, rounded scales. Fossils show, as the animals grew, the scales on the undersides of their bodies {{developed}} into large, wide ventral plates. The plates overlap {{each other in a}} way that allows a wide range of flexibility. Later semiaquatic temnospondyls, such as trematosaurs and capitosaurs, have no evidence of scales. They may have lost scales to make movement easier under water or to allow cutaneous respiration, the absorption of oxygen through the skin.|$|E
5|$|On average {{within any}} one population, males {{tend to have}} fewer spots on the {{underside}} and are paler in colour than females. The latter are also larger with a strong female T. alba of a large subspecies weighing over 550g (19.4oz), while males are typically about 10% lighter. Nestlings <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> white down, but the heart-shaped facial disk becomes visible soon after hatching.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the pioneers}} of {{research}} into animal coloration, Edward Bagnall Poulton classified the forms of protective coloration, {{in a way which}} is still helpful.

5|$|At {{first the}} moth {{was thought to}} be from China or Bengal, but was later found to be endemic to Madagascar. It is found {{throughout}} the year {{in most parts of the}} island, with peak populations between March and August, and smallest numbers between October and December. Females lay about 80 eggs under the leaves of Omphalea spp. The caterpillars are whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> club-ended black setae. Silk spun from the mouth helps the caterpillars hold on to smooth leaves and climb back to the plant when they fall. After completing four instars, the caterpillars spin an open network cocoon. The pupal stage lasts from 17 to 23 days.|$|E

5|$|Chicks hatch within 24 {{hours of}} each other. Six days after hatching, the chicks' eyes have opened and after eight days they <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> whitish down. Chicks defecate {{outside of the}} nest by raising their tail {{to the side of}} the nest, so nests with older chicks are {{surrounded}} by faecal matter. Both parents feed and brood the chicks, taking it in turns. When one parent returns with food, it takes over brooding duties while the other leaves to hunt.|$|E
5|$|Described {{as being}} similar {{to members of}} the genera Pareledone, Eledone, and Enteroctopus, V. togata has a large body with large eyes and {{extensive}} membranes that link the octopus' arms together. The species has a single line of suckers on each arm, and its head, mantle, and part of its arms <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> warts. Although the reproductive habits of V. togata have not been extensively studied, the species is believed {{to be one of the}} most fecund among octopuses in its region and depth level, despite the species possessing large eggs and extremely large spermatophores.|$|E
5|$|Deserts are {{increasingly}} seen as sources for solar energy, {{partly due to}} low amounts of cloud cover. Many successful solar power plants have {{been built in the}} Mojave Desert. These plants have a combined capacity of 354 megawatts (MW) making them the largest solar power installation in the world. Large swaths of this desert <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> mirrors, including nine fields of solar collectors.

5|$|Earth's {{lithosphere}} {{is divided}} into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, mostly by oceans. The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes, rivers and other sources of water {{that contribute to the}} hydrosphere. The majority of Earth's polar regions <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|Fundamental {{rights for}} Indians {{have also been}} aimed at {{overturning}} the inequalities of pre-independence social practices.

They also forbid trafficking of human beings and forced labour (a crime). They also protect cultural and educational rights of ethnic and religious minorities by allowing them to preserve their languages and also establish and administer their own education institutions.
