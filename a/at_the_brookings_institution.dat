50|$|Between 1931-1933 Abrams was a {{research}} fellow <b>at</b> <b>the</b> progressive <b>Brookings</b> <b>Institution</b> in Washington, DC. In 1933 he joined the research department of the London Press Exchange, one of Britain's leading advertising agencies. Here Abrams began developing his pioneering work in social investigation, market research, and opinion polling by conducting large-scale statistical surveys into consumer behaviour. His national newspaper readership surveys, which included over 20,000 participants between 1934-38, were landmarks in survey research and helped initiate the ABC1 system of social classification. Abrams's contacts with other social scientists working abroad during this period led to his work retrieving refugees from Nazi Europe (in 1939 helping Sigmund Freud make his final move to England).|$|R

50|$|A 2012 study {{authored}} by researchers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Breakthrough Institute, <b>Brookings</b> <b>Institution,</b> and World Resources Institute estimated that between 2009 and 2014 {{the federal government}} will spend $150 billion on clean energy through a combination of direct spending and tax expenditures. Renewable electricity (mainly wind, solar, geothermal, hydro, and tidal energy) will account for the largest share of this expenditure, 32.1%, while spending on liquid biofuels will account for the next largest share, 16.1%. Spending on multiple and other forms of clean energy, including energy efficiency, electric vehicles and advanced batteries, high-speed rail, grid and transportation electrification, nuclear, and advanced fossil fuel technologies, will account for the remaining share, 51.8%. Moreover, the report finds that absent federal action, spending on clean energy will decline by 75%, from $44.3 billion in 2009 to $11.0 billion in 2014.|$|R
