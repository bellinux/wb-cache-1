5|$|Culturally the Antankarana {{have many}} {{similarities}} with the neighboring Sakalava. They practice tromba (ancestral spirit possession) <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> nature spirits. They {{adhere to a}} wide range of fady (ancestral taboos), particularly including several that serve to protect wildlife and wilderness areas. The traditional economy of the Antankarana revolved around fishing and livestock, although more recently they have adopted farming; many are salary earners working in civil administration, teaching, trade and other areas.|$|E

5|$|Culturally the Betsimisaraka can {{be divided}} into {{northern}} and southern sub-groups. Many elements of culture are common across both groups, including respect for ancestors, spirit possession, the ritual sacrifice of zebu, and a patriarchal social structure. The groups are distinguished by linguistic sub-dialects and various fady (taboos), as well as certain funeral practices and other customs. The Betsimisaraka practice famadihana (reburial) and sambatra (circumcision) <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> sorcery and a wide range of supernatural forces. Many taboos and folktales revolve around lemurs and crocodiles, both of which are common throughout Betsimisaraka territory.|$|E

5|$|One poll {{reported}} in the journal Nature showed that among American scientists (across various disciplines), about 40 percent believe in both evolution and an active deity (theistic evolution). This {{is similar to the}} results reported for surveys of the general American public. Also, about 40 percent of the scientists polled believe in a God that answers prayers, <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> immortality. While about 55% of scientists surveyed were atheists, agnostics, or nonreligious theists, atheism is far from universal among scientists who support evolution, or among the general public that supports evolution. Very similar results were reported from a 1997 Gallup Poll of the American public and scientists.|$|E
5|$|Kojima Productions have {{compared}} Raiden and Solid Snake {{as to their}} experiences and ways of thinking. During the game's climax, Raiden stays handcuffed until his final fight against Solidus Snake; Snake escapes from his handcuffs to follow Revolver Ocelot, emphasizing Raiden's lack of freedom. Hideo Kojima compared Raiden and Snake with movie monsters King Kong and Godzilla, respectively; the former was taken from his home and his nature changed upon meeting Rosemary, whereas the latter will continue fighting against mankind's menaces. Defeating Solidus, Raiden is encouraged by Snake to trust himself <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> his own choices. This is further addressed by the staff's motivation {{to make a new}} sequel to Metal Gear without Kojima. Kojima has also likened him with John Rambo from the Rambo series as both characters always find themselves taking part in battles despite their desire for a peaceful resolution.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} the Muslim world spans about 1400 years and {{includes}} a variety of socio-political developments, as well as advances in the arts, science, philosophy, and technology, particularly during the Islamic Golden Age. All Muslims look for guidance to the Quran <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> the prophetic mission of Muhammad, but disagreements on other matters have led to appearance of different religious schools and branches within Islam. In the modern era, most of the Muslim world came under influence or colonial domination of European powers. The nation states {{that emerged in the}} post-colonial era have adopted a variety of political and economic models, and they have been affected by secular and as well as religious trends.|$|E
25|$|ECFE, or Evangelical Church Fellowship of Ethiopia, mostly {{covers all}} of the Evangelical Christian churches who are born-again Christians <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> the {{ideology}} of the Trinity. There are 22 denominations under this religious umbrella and based on 2004 statistics their total membership numbers have reached 11.5 million and had an increase of 4 million annually. All churches, regardless of denomination, are domestically known as Abiate kristianat means churches in Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia. Most of them also own ministries, colleges and bible societies like Ethiopian Graduate school of Theology, Golden Oil Ministries, Evangelical Theological college, Ethiopian Bible society and Meserete Kristos college. These churches often work together by exchanging preachers and organizing conferences.|$|E

25|$|Alexei's {{haemophilia}} was {{integral to}} the rise of Grigori Rasputin. One of the many things Rasputin did that unintentionally facilitated the fall of the Romanovs was to tell the Tsar that the war would be won once he (Tsar Nicholas II) took command of the Russian Army. Following this advice was a serious mistake as the Tsar had no military experience. The Tsarina, Empress Alexandra, a deeply religious woman, came to rely upon Rasputin <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> his ability to help Alexei where conventional doctors had failed. This theme is explored in Robert K. Massie's Nicholas and Alexandra. It is possible that if Alexei had not suffered so terribly, Rasputin could never have gained such influence over Russian politics during World War I, which is generally seen to have at least hastened the collapse of Romanov rule.|$|E

Rosenbaum echoes that opinion, believing that Lex can never get enough; [...] "Lex is an insatiable character". Rosenbaum believes that nothing will satisfy Lex's hunger, {{and that he will}} keep going until he is president of the United States. Even then, he will keep trying to make the majority of people like <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> him.|$|E

He credits his parents [...] with instilling virtues {{of hard work and}} discipline into him and his siblings; [...] "They taught us to be honest, work hard, respect our elders, <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> ourselves". Olajuwon has expressed displeasure at his childhood in Nigeria being characterized as backward. [...] "Lagos is a very cosmopolitan city...There are many ethnic groups. I grew up in an environment at schools where there were all different types of people." ...|$|E

500|$|The City {{contains}} three factions: the Keepers, and {{two opposing}} religious orders {{known as the}} Pagans and the Order of the Hammer, or [...] "Hammerites". The latter two have been cited as representations of chaos and order, respectively; the neutral, secretive Keepers strive to maintain balance within the City. The Hammerites worship a deity called [...] "The Builder", <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> progress, craftsmanship and righteousness; the Pagans, who {{have been described as}} [...] "primitive, almost animalistic", worship the dangerous [...] "Trickster" [...] god and value the natural world. It has been assessed that the design of each group's architecture reflects their beliefs.|$|E
500|$|The area's scenery is {{characterized}} by its beaches, rocky outcrops and low cliff tops and is relatively unspoiled. [...] At {{one end of the}} beach is a [...] "rocky headland of fossilized coral, which is a jumble of cracks, caves and chimneys that make an ideal roost for bats" [...] and there are baobab trees in the vicinity. There is a reef channel at Msambweni and aquifer which is about [...] south of the Tiwi aquifer. The reef, which stretches from Msambweni to Malindi in the north, is the world's largest continuous fringing reef. At the northern end of Msambweni Bay is Chale Island, a headland rather than an island, which is known as a sacred kaya (worshipping place). Many of the locals are superstitious <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> witchcraft and spirits (jinis).|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} months after the April 1978 revolution, Hafizullah Amin and Taraki had a very close relationship. Taraki {{reportedly}} remarked, [...] "Amin and I are like nail and flesh, not separable". Amin set about constructing a personality cult centered on Taraki. In party and government meetings Amin always referred to Taraki as [...] "The Great Leader", [...] "The Star of the East" [...] or [...] "The Great Thinker" [...] among other titles, while Amin was given such titles as [...] "The True Disciple and Student". Amin would later come to realize he had created a monster when the Kim Il-sung-like personality cult he had created inspired Taraki to become overly confident <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> his own brilliance. Taraki began discounting Amin's suggestions, fostering in Amin {{a deep sense of}} resentment. As their relationship turned increasingly sour, a power struggle developed between them for the control of the Afghan National Army. Their relations came to a head later that year when Taraki accused Amin of nepotism after Amin had appointed several family members to high-ranking positions.|$|E

500|$|A jubilant Thomas {{described}} the free kick {{as the most}} crucial goal of his career, and believed Wrexham had every chance of causing another upset in the next round, despite an unfavourable away draw: [...] "We are disappointed not {{to be at home}} but after beating the champions we're not afraid of anyone." [...] He credited the club for their conditioning programme but also attributed the good form to casual drinking: [...] "I always have two pints of Guinness on a Friday, sometimes more. It gives me energy, I feel stronger <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> it." [...] His manager Flynn admitted Thomas [...] "trains when he wants to train," [...] and added: [...] "I will take whatever he's taking to keep him going. And if he was 10 years younger I'd be able to sell him for £5m." [...] Days after the win, Thomas was charged by North Wales Police for his involvement in a counterfeit currency scam. He was arrested a year later, and following a trial was sentenced to 18 months in jail.|$|E
500|$|Grey is {{the protagonist}} and {{focal point of}} the series. She has been called [...] "intelligent, compassionate, hard-working, oftentimes outspoken, easily distracted, and indecisive" [...] by Grey's Anatomy executives. Pompeo says she is unaware if her {{character}} knows how to have fun, adding: [...] "All of my scenes with [...] are the same—we're either breaking up or having sex." [...] Her personality has evolved over the past few seasons from depressed, to happy and [...] "fixed". Pompeo said to Good Morning America, [...] "I am so incredibly lucky to have Patrick , to have the chemistry that we do, we have an amazing relationship, and it's like any other relationship, you have your ups and downs. But we work it out, and we've found a way to do this for this long and still get along, and make it work <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> what we're doing." [...] Pompeo told Entertainment Weekly: [...] "It's awkward with Patrick [...] because he's like my brother. As soon as the camera is off, I'm like, 'Is your hand on my butt?' But there are millions of girls who have been waiting for this, so I feel an obligation to the fans." [...] Rhimes used the dog [...] "Doc", which Meredith and Derek shared, as a metaphor of their relationship during the second season. She characterizes Grey as doing what she thinks is right: ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Grinning Man" [...] {{received}} a mixed response from critics, and was watched by 9.91 million viewers, with a 36% {{share of the}} total television audience. The episode beat ITV's Marple in the same time-slot, with Geraldine McEwan's last episode as Agatha Christie's famous sleuth receiving just 4.48 million viewers and a 15% audience share. The Sunday Times AA Gill was critical of the episode, suggesting that the series had been revived: [...] "because of some dire piece of market research where they asked single, lonely, overweight, over-40 women who keep cats <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> ghosts who they fancied most on television, and Alan Davies must have beaten Huw Edwards by a woolly head." [...] Of the episode itself, he wrote: [...] "It skids between procedural whodunit realism and cartoonish fantasy {{in a way that}} defies belief and interest. It is a dull confusion of unknotted loose ends that breaks its own rules, suspends common sense and dumps so much unexplained plot that all suspense drains away through the holes in the story." [...] The Herald's Alasdair McKay was critical of Davies' acting in the episode, writing that: [...] "it really is difficult {{to tell the difference between}} the comedian and the accidental detective in David Renwick's comedy drama. Davies doesn't act, he tries to stay awake, occasionally pausing for a cryptic insight." [...] While The Scotsmans Paul Whitelaw similarly noted that Davies appeared to be playing [...] "a slightly grumpier version" [...] of himself, he was [...] "quite impressed" [...] by Davies performance, having never seen him act before. Whitelaw found that [...] "the episode itself left a lot to be desired", writing that its central mystery was [...] "solid" [...] and its solution was [...] "satisfyingly creepy", but that [...] "At two hours in length it was fatally overstretched [...] It was as though Renwick, who also directed, had been given 120 minutes to fill without having enough material to fill them – the narrative equivalent of an interminable jam session based around some fundamentally decent riffs." [...] Steve Pratt, writing for The Northern Echo, was similarly critical of the episode's length, deeming the Adam Klaus subplot [...] "nonsense" [...] which [...] "could easily be removed without loss". Pratt suggested that [...] "This would also help reduce the overlong two-hour running time, during which my attention wandered more often than it should have done." [...] The Observers Euan Ferguson shared a similar sentiment, writing that the episode: ...|$|E
