40|$|Many lakes {{located in}} the Songnen Plain of China exhibit a high saline-alkaline level. 25 lakes in the Songnen Plain were {{selected}} as research objects in this study. Water samples in these lakes were collected from June to August in 2008. Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and Total Alkalinity (TA) were measured to assess the saline-alkaline level, and partial canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was conducted as well. The {{results show that the}} majority of these lakes in the study area could be categorized into HCO 3 [...] Na+-I type. According to the TDS assessment, of the total 25 lakes, there are 14 for freshwater, 7 for brackish water and 4 for saltwater; and the respective range of TA was from 0. 98 to 40. 52. The relationship between TA and TDS indicated significant linear relationship (R 2 = 0. 9292) in the HCO 3 [...] Na+-I type lakes in the Songnen Plain. There was a general trend that cell density, genera richness and taxonomic diversity decreased with the increase of saline-alkaline gradient, whereas a contrary trend was observed for the proportion of dominant species. When the TDS values were above 3 × 103 mg/L and the TA values were above 15 mg/L, there was a significant reduction in cell density, genera richness and biodiversity, and their corresponding values were respectively below 10 × 106 (ind/L), 15 and approximately 2. 5. Through the partial canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), 10. 7 % of the genera variation was explained by pure saline-alkaline variables. Cyclotella meneghiniana, Melosira ambigua and Melosira granulate were found to become the dominant species in most of these lakes, which indicated that there may be rather wide saline-alkaline niches for common dominant species. <b>About</b> <b>one-quarters</b> of the genera which have certain tolerance to salinity and alkalinity preferred to live in the regions with relatively higher saline-alkaline levels in this study...|$|R

It was also highlighted, however, that women were more polite and well mannered than male operators.

Steady, bold, and active, Morton hesitated not to follow her; but the necessary attention to secure his hold and footing in a descent where both foot and hand were needful for security, prevented him from looking around him, till, having descended nigh twenty feet, and being sixty or seventy above the pool which received the fall, his guide made a pause, and he again found himself by her side {{in a situation that}} appeared equally romantic and precarious. They were nearly opposite to the waterfall, and in point of level situated at <b>about</b> <b>one-quarter's</b> depth from the point of the cliff over which it thundered, and three-fourths of the height above the dark, deep, and restless pool which received its fall.

They were so near this grand phenomenon that they were covered with its spray, and well-nigh deafened by the incessant roar. But crossing in the very front of the fall, and at scarce three yards distance from the cataract, an old oak-tree, flung across the chasm in a manner that seemed accidental, formed a bridge of fearfully narrow dimensions and uncertain footing.

They were compared to a group of 20 subjects (controls) with a non-restored natural dentition. For the stereognostic ability test, subjects had to recognise ten different test pieces by manipulating them with two antagonistic incisor teeth, avoiding any contact with other oral structures. Both response time and percentage accuracy of recognition were evaluated. The present findings indicated that subjects with an overdenture on implants did not score significantly different from those with an implant-supported fixed prosthesis. In contrast, subjects with teeth had a significantly better stereognostic ability. The percentage of correct responses was 52 % for overdentures, 56 % for fixed prostheses on implants and 75 % for natural dentitions.

40|$|Abstract Given the {{increasing}} demand for carbon dioxide storage estimates in urban areas and the high cost for ground-based inventories, there is need for more efficient approaches. Limited open-grown urban tree species biomass equations have necessitated use of forest-derived equations with diverse conclusions on the accuracy of these equations to estimate urban biomass and carbon storage. Our goal was to determine and explain variability among estimates of CO 2 storage from four sets of allometric equations for the same ground sample of 640 trees. Also, we compare the variability found in CO 2 stored and sequestered per hectare among estimation approaches for Sacramento’s urban forest with the variation found among six other cities. We found substantial variability among the four approaches. Storage estimates differed by a maximum of 29 % and ranged from 38 to 49 t/ha. The two sequestration estimates differed by 55 %, ranging from 1. 8 to 2. 8 t/ha. To put these numbers in perspective, they amounted to <b>about</b> one-tenth and <b>one-quarter</b> of the maximum differences in CO 2 storage and sequestration rates among six cities, respectively. i-Tree Eco produced the lowest storage estimates, perhaps because it relied exclusively on forest-based equations and applied a 0. 80 correction factor to open-grown trees. The storage estimates produced by i-Tree Streets and CUFR Tree Carbon Calculator (CTCC) were the highest, while Urban General Equations produced relatively low estimates of CO 2 storage.

40|$|Staphylokinsae (SAK) forms a bimolecular complex {{with human}} plasmin(ogen) and changes its {{substrate}} specificity by exposing new exosites that enhances accession of substrate plasminogen (PG) to the plasmin (Pm) active site. Protein modelling studies indicated {{the crucial role}} of a loop in SAK (SAK 90 -loop; Thr(90) -Glu(100)) for the docking of the substrate PG to the SAK-Pm complex. Function of SAK 90 -loop was studied by site-directed mutagenesis and loop deletion. Deletion of nine amino acid residues (Tyr(92) -Glu(100)) from the SAK 90 -loop, resulted in approximately 60 % reduction in the PG activation, but it retained the ability to generate an active site within the complex of loop mutant of SAK (SAKDelta 90) and Pm. The preformed activator complex of SAKDelta 90 with Pm, however, displayed a 50 - 60 % reduction in substrate PG activation that remained unaffected {{in the presence of}} kringle domains (K 1 +K 2 +K 3 +K 4) of PG, whereas PG activation by SAK-Pm complex displayed approximately 50 % reduction in the presence of kringles, suggesting the involvement of the kringle domains in modulating the PG activation by native SAK but not by SAKDelta 90. Lysine residues (Lys(94), Lys(96), Lys(97) and Lys(98)) of the SAK 90 -loop were individually mutated into alanine and, among these four SAK loop mutants, SAK(K 97 A) and SAK(K 98 A) exhibited specific activities <b>about</b> one-third and <b>one-quarter</b> respectively of the native SAK. The kinetic parameters of PG activation of their 1 : 1 complex with Pm indicated that the K(m) values of PG towards the activator complex of these two SAK mutants were 4 - 6 -fold higher, suggesting the decreased accessibility of the substrate PG to the activator complex formed by these SAK mutants. These results demonstrated the involvement of the Lys(97) and Lys(98) residues of the SAK 90 -loop in assisting the interaction with substrate PG. These interactions of SAK-Pm activator complex via the SAK 90 -loop may provide additional anchorage site(s) to the substrate PG that, in turn, may promote the overall process of SAK-mediated PG activation...|$|R

In five diverse muscle groups (extensor digitorum communis, gluteus maximus, diaphragm, extensor digitorum longus, and soleus) from mice 10 - 12 or 31 months of age, bimodal m. e. p. p. amplitude distributions were present in about 20 % of fibres sampled. In the common bimodal distribution (type 1), the rise times of small mode m. e. p. p. s were similar to those of large mode m. e. p. p. s. A rare class of small mode m. e. p. p. s (type 2) having long rise times was also observed. Amplitudes and half-decay times of type 1 small mode m. e. p. p. s increased in the presence of an anticholinesterase (edrophonium). Increasing extracellular potassium concentration led to an increase in large mode m. e. p. p. frequency but had more variable effects on small mode frequency. In the few cases available for study, type 2 small mode m. e. p. p. s disappeared after addition of edrophonium or increased potassium. When the extracellular calcium/magnesium ratio was reduced, large mode but not small mode m. e. p. p. frequency decreased. In almost all muscle fibres in which end-plate potentials (e. p. p. s) were evoked by nerve stimulation at 20 Hz in low calcium/high magnesium solution, small mode e. p. p. s similar to small mode m. e. p. p. s appeared during 'failures' of large mode m. e. p. p. s. Also, in twelve out of fifteen fibres which had unimodal m. e. p. p. amplitude distributions, small mode e. p. p. s appeared which were similar in amplitude to small mode m. e. p. p. s in fibres with type 1 bimodal m. e. p. p. s. Thus, if both spontaneous and evoked potentials are included, small mode m. e. p. p. s are present at most CBF- 1 mouse adult neuromuscular junctions independent of muscle type or animal age.

The incidence is higher in less developed countries, where penile cancer can account for up to 10 % of cancers among men {{in some parts of}} Africa, South America, and Asia. Objective: To describe the human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA prevalence, HPV type distribution, and detection of markers of viral activity (ie, E 6 *I mRNA and p 16 (INK 4 a)) in a series of invasive penile cancers and penile high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HGSILs) from 25 countries. A total of 85 penile HGSILs and 1010 penile invasive cancers diagnosed from 1983 to 2011 were included. Design, setting, and participants: After histopathologic evaluation of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, HPV DNA detection and genotyping were performed using the SPF- 10 /DEIA/LiPA(25) system, v. 1 (Laboratory Biomedical Products, Rijswijk, The Netherlands). HPV DNA-positive cases were additionally tested for oncogene E 6 *I mRNA and all cases for p 16 (INK 4 a) expression, a surrogate marker of oncogenic HPV activity. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: HPV DNA prevalence and type distributions were estimated. Results and limitations: HPV DNA was detected in 33. 1 % of penile cancers (95 % confidence interval [CI], 30. 2 - 36. 1) and in 87. 1 % of HGSILs (95 % CI, 78. 0 - 93. 4). The warty-basaloid histologic subtype showed the highest HPV DNA prevalence. Among cancers, statistically significant differences in prevalence were observed only by geographic region and not by period or by age at diagnosis. HPV 16 was the most frequent HPV type detected in both HPV-positive cancers (68. 7 %) and HGSILs (79. 6 %). HPV 6 was the second most common type in invasive cancers (3. 7 %). The p 16 (INK 4 a) upregulation and mRNA detection in addition to HPV DNA positivity were observed in 69. 3 % of HGSILs, and {{at least one of these}} HPV activity markers was detected in 85. 3 % of cases. In penile cancers, these figures were 22. 0 % and 27. 1 %, respectively. Conclusions: About a third to a fourth of penile cancers were related to HPV when considering HPV DNA detection alone or adding an HPV activity marker, respectively. The observed HPV type distribution reinforces the potential benefit of current and new HPV vaccines in the reduction of HPV-related penile neoplastic lesions. Patient summary: <b>About</b> one-third to <b>one-quarter</b> of penile cancers were related to human papillomavirus (HPV).

25|$|<b>About</b> <b>one-quarter</b> of {{the poems}} in the Carmina Burana are {{accompanied}} in the manuscript by music using unheighted, staffless neumes, an archaic system of musical notation {{that by the time}} of the manuscript had largely been superseded by staffed neumes. Unheighted neumes only indicate whether a given note is pitched higher or lower than the preceding note, without giving any indication of how much change in pitch there is between two notes, so they are useful only as mnemonic devices for singers who are already familiar with the melody. However, it is possible to identify many of those melodies by comparing them with melodies notated in staffed neumes in other contemporary manuscripts from the schools of Notre Dame and Saint Martial.|$|E
25|$|The area of Oaxaca {{has been}} divided into small {{entities}} since far {{back into the}} pre-Hispanic period. Much {{of the reason for}} this is the highly mountainous geography, although the occupation of the area by numerous ethnicities is a factor as well. The area resisted large scale Spanish domination through the colonial era, and maintained local traditions and customs better than other areas of Mexico. Even today, the state has far more municipalities and semi autonomous local authorities than any other state in the nation. Oaxaca is divided into 570 municipalities, <b>about</b> <b>one-quarter</b> of the total of the country. Many of the municipalities of the state had been ill-defined from colonial times until the 1990 INEGI survey which delineated them with exact coordinates. The most populated municipality is the capital, followed by San Juan Bautista Tuxtepec and Juchitán de Zaragoza. There is also a system of thirty districts to group municipalities.|$|E
25|$|The ARM2 {{featured}} a 32-bit data bus, 26-bit address space and 2732-bit registers. Eightbits {{from the program}} counter register were available for other purposes; the top sixbits (available because of the 26-bit address space) served as status flags, and the bottom twobits (available because the program counter was always word-aligned) were used for setting modes. The address bus was extended to 32bits in the ARM6, but program code still had to lie within the first 64MB of memory in 26-bit compatibility mode, due to the reserved bits for the status flags. The ARM2 had a transistor count of just 30,000, compared to Motorola's six-year-older 68000 model with around 40,000. Much of this simplicity came {{from the lack of}} microcode (which represents <b>about</b> <b>one-quarter</b> to one-third of the 68000) and from (like most CPUs of the day) not including any cache. This simplicity enabled low power consumption, yet better performance than the Intel 80286. A successor, ARM3, was produced with a 4KB cache, which further improved performance.|$|E
25|$|The {{surviving}} {{texts of}} the Avesta, as they exist today, derive from a single master copy produced by Sasanian Empire-era (224–651 CE) collation and recension. That master copy, now lost, {{is known as the}} 'Sassanian archetype'. The oldest surviving manuscript (K1) of an Avestan language text is dated 1323 CE. Summaries of the various Avesta texts found in the 9th/10th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition suggest that {{a significant portion of the}} literature in the Avestan language has been lost. Only <b>about</b> <b>one-quarter</b> of the Avestan sentences or verses referred to by the 9th/10th century commentators can be found in the surviving texts. This suggests that three-quarters of Avestan material, including an indeterminable number of juridical, historical and legendary texts, have been lost since then. On the other hand, it appears that the most valuable portions of the canon, including all of the oldest texts, have survived. The likely reason for this is that the surviving materials represent those portions of the Avesta that were in regular liturgical use, and therefore known by heart by the priests and not dependent for their preservation on the survival of particular manuscripts.|$|E
