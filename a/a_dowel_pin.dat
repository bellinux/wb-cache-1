50|$|Dowel pins {{are often}} used as precise {{locating}} devices in machinery. Steel dowel pins are machined to tight tolerances, as are the corresponding holes, which are typically reamed. <b>A</b> <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> may have a smaller diameter than its hole so that it freely slips in, or a larger diameter so {{that it must be}} pressed into its hole (an interference fit).|$|E
50|$|A circlip (a {{portmanteau}} of {{circle and}} clip), {{also known as}} a C-Clip, Seeger ring, snap ring or Jesus clip, is a type of fastener or retaining ring consisting of a semi-flexible metal ring with open ends which can be snapped into place, into a machined groove on <b>a</b> <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> or other part to permit rotation but to prevent lateral movement. There are two basic types: internal and external, referring to whether they are fitted into a bore or over a shaft. Circlips are often used to secure pinned connections.|$|E

5000|$|Bolts {{are often}} {{used to make a}} bolted joint. This is a {{combination}} of the nut applying an axial clamping force and also the shank of the bolt acting as <b>a</b> <b>dowel,</b> <b>pinning</b> the joint against sideways shear forces. For this reason, many bolts have a plain unthreaded shank (called the [...] ) as this makes for <b>a</b> better, stronger <b>dowel.</b> The presence of the unthreaded shank has often been given as characteristic of bolts vs. screws, [...] but this is incidental to its use, rather than defining. The grip length should be chosen carefully, to be around the same length as the thickness of the materials, and any washers, bolted together. Too short places the dowel shear load onto the threads, which may cause fretting wear on the hole. Too long prevents the nut from being tightened down correctly. No more than two turns of the thread should be within the hole.|$|R
50|$|Tensioning is {{done with}} a simple wooden lever, the webbing stretcher. This looks like a bat or paddle with a simple handle, a {{locating}} groove along the opposing edge and a slot in the centre. The webbing is {{held in place by}} placing a loop through the slot and locking it with <b>a</b> wooden <b>dowel</b> <b>pin.</b> This pin is usually attached to the stretcher with a short chain or string. Using chain avoids the inconvenient twisting tendency of string.|$|R
50|$|Two-piece plain {{bearings}}, {{known as}} full bearings in industrial machinery, {{are commonly used}} for larger diameters, such as crankshaft bearings. The two halves are called shells. There are various systems used to keep the shells located. The most common method is a tab on the parting line edge that correlates with a notch in the housing to prevent axial movement after installation. For large, thick shells a button stop or dowel pin is used. The button stop is screwed to the housing, while the dowel pin keys the two shells together. Another less common method uses <b>a</b> <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> that keys the shell to the housing through a hole or slot in the shell.|$|E
40|$|Bosch Rexroth in Mellansel {{develops}} and fabricates Hägglunds {{hydraulic motors}} among other things. One {{important component of}} the motor is the cam ring, which commonly affects the life span of the motor. The aim is to create the basis of a testing equipment where a loose cam ring can be tested. Previously, a complete motor has been used in order to test the fatigue resistance of the cam ring. In order to load the cam ring similar to the real case. FEM-analysis was performed to investigate how the cam ring is affected during loading and how the rig should be built for the strains to be similar to the real case. The result of this simulation was compiled in a Haighdiagram in order to get an indication of the magnitude of the stresses. The solution is a testing equipment which consist of a cylinder block which usually is in the motor. The cylinder block is bolted onto a bottom plate where the cam ring has a given position. The cam ring is fixated using a sloted spring pin and <b>a</b> <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> that keeps the cam ring in position and prevents potential torque. All pistons should be pressurised by pulsation at the same time using the same pressure, thus, the torque is expected to be zero. One of the holes which is holding the cam ring is oval, this is to allow deformation of the cam ring. The result of this work is a basic plan for the components included which affects the mechanical function of the testing equipment. A limitation of this work has been that the residual stresses in the clearance holes is unknown. These residual stresses have a great importance for fatigue resistance of the cam rings. As a consequence of this, it has been difficult to estimate which working pressure the test rig has to use in order to achieve the desired life span. Experimental testing when using the rig will indicate this. Task monotoring  The testing equipment will generate 1 - 10 million loading cycles before failure of the cam ring occurs. Will be achieved through experimental testing  Testing time should be reasonable, result would preferably be achieved within 2 - 4 weeks. Will be achieved through experimental testing  The testing equipment should be customised for a CA 50 - 50 cam ring. (CA 50 motor series strongest motor 50 Nm/bar) Achieved  Testing equipment should be usable with the current laboratory equipment of Bosh Rexroths (420 bars maximum preassure). Probably achieved  The crack needs to be detected in an appropriate way, to stop the testing.

40|$|Statement of Problem: Given that meticulous implant {{prosthodontic}} {{procedures are}} recommended {{to obtain the}} best possible intraoral fit, the die systems used for multi implant casts warrant further investigation. Die stone expansion and errors introduced by removable die casts may exceed the accuracy required for the passive fit of implant prosthesis. Purpose: The {{purpose of the study}} was to evaluate the linear dimensional accuracy between the implant master die and three conceptually different die systems such as Pindex system, Accu-trac precision die system, and Conventional brass <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> system. Materials and Methods: Thirty impressions of implant master die were made with polyether impression material. Ten experimental implant casts were fabricated for each of the three different die systems tested: Accu-trac precision die tray system, Pindex system, and conventional brass <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> system. The solid experimental casts were sectioned and then removed from the die system 30 times. Linear distances between all six possible distances were measured from one centre of the transfer coping to the other, using a co-ordinate measuring machine in millimeters up to accuracy of 0. 5 microns. Data were tabulated and statistically analyzed by Binomial non parametric test using SPSS version 15. Results: Significant differences were found for distance A-B (P = 0. 002), A-C (P = 0. 002), A-D (P value = 0. 002), and B-D (P = 0. 021) in Conventional <b>Dowel</b> <b>pin</b> system however for Accu-trac precision die tray system, it was significant only for distance A-D (P = 0. 002) but for Pindex system it was non-significant for all the distances measured.

40|$|The {{design of}} shear-carrying {{structures}} very often profits by the dowel action developed by reinforcing bars or shear connectors, since dowel action is, in principle, a very efficient shear-transfer mechanism. Within the same element, the reinforcing bars may act as dowels {{as soon as}} stress-induced interfaces form (cracks in the ultimate load situation), while shear connectors between side-by-side elements (studs, <b>pins,</b> <b>dowels)</b> develop <b>a</b> <b>dowel</b> action {{from the very beginning}} of the loading process, including the service load situation.
