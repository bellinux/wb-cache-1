500|$|Cruz {{has donated}} {{money and time}} to charity. In {{addition}} to work in Nepal, she has volunteered in Uganda and India, where she spent a week working with Mother Teresa that included assisting in a leprosy clinic. That trip inspired Cruz to help start a foundation to support homeless girls in India, where she sponsors two young women. She donated her salary from her first Hollywood film, The Hi-Lo Country, to Mother Teresa's mission. In the early 2000s, she spent time in Nepal photographing Tibetan children for an exhibition attended by the Dalai Lama. She also photographed residents at the Pacific Lodge Boys' Home, {{most of whom are}} former gang members and recovering substance abusers. She said: [...] "These kids break my heart. I have to control myself not to cry. Not out of pity, but seeing how tricky life is <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> it is to make the right choices." [...] A pregnant Cruz showed her support for the battle against AIDS by lighting up the Empire State Building with red lights in New York City on 1 December 2010 on International AIDS Day, as part of (RED)'s new awareness campaign, 'An AIDS Free Generation is Due in 2015,' which aims to eradicate the HIV virus from pregnant mothers to their babies. [...] In 2012, she posed for an ad supporting PETA's anti-fur campaign.|$|E
500|$|After the sprint race, Coletti {{spoke of}} his {{childhood}} dream of hearing the Monegasque national anthem while standing {{on the top step}} of the Monaco podium, [...] "It feels great I mean I’ve seen all the drivers winning here since I was a kid. I’m really, really happy especially that with this win I’ve consolidated my lead in the standings." [...] He said for the season's next race at Silverstone his team need to improve his car in qualifying trim and then aim to secure victory in the feature race. Quaife-Hobbs said it felt [...] "amazing" [...] to clinch his first career podium, [...] "Today, it’s a great reward for the team <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> they’ve worked. We are a new team. Now every new team have had a podium." [...] Quaife-Hobbs believed if he had defended from Coletti on the third lap both drivers would not have entered the Novelle Chicane and affirmed that he elected to follow Coletti with the view for a attack later in the race. Third-place finisher Evans revealed on the formation lap he struggled to get the optimum rear tyre temperature especially {{since the start of the}} race was the best time to gain track position and was aware that finishing on the podium would probably not be realistic. Nevertheless he was happy to have again finished on the Monaco podium after altering his car.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2017, Hwayoung and {{her twin}} sister Hyoyoung {{appeared}} on a reality show and spoke about the controversy again; with Hwayoung saying her sister {{was the only person}} who had supported her during the incident, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> everything had been for her. Soon afterwards a former staff member stepped forwards and alleged that it had actually been the twins who had [...] "bullied" [...] the other members, and released texts that appeared to show Hyoyoung threatening former member Areum with physical harm for not supporting Hwayoung's behaviour. Soon afterwards, more and more staffers came forwards with evidence that Hwayoung had been disrespectful to the other members as well as stylists, and had faked how severe her initial injury was in order to get more sympathy. Hwayoung initially tried to deny the rumours, lashing out at the staffers in return, but eventually admitted that the texts were real. After suffering from an intense backlash, including being removed from several television shows, Hwayoung deleted her Instagram account.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the play}} begins, Nicola is being guided through an unoccupied flat by Stewart, her estate agent, keen {{to make a}} sale. Stewart is unable to get Nicola's approval, chiefly {{because there is no}} {{suitable}} room {{to be used as a}} [...] "study" [...] for her fiancé, Dan. However, when Nicola returns to her current flat, she expresses frustration over Dan's insistence that their new flat must have a study. When challenged as to what Dan needs a study for, his reasons are rather flimsy, such as needing a room to quietly reflect and contemplate things. Nicola is also frustrated by Dan's lack of effort to find a job, and lack of housekeeping. Dan goes out drinking at a hotel bar where he is a regular, known by the bartender, Ambrose, with whom Dan shares his philosophy on women <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> they are to please. It become clear that Dan has very little idea what to do with his life. He returns drunk, to Nicola's annoyance.|$|E
