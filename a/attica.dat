5|$|After {{staying at}} Eretria {{for a few}} days, the Persians made {{their way down the}} coast towards <b>Attica.</b> The Persians dropped the {{captured}} Eretrians off on the island of Aegilia, before landing at the bay of Marathon in <b>Attica.</b> The Persians' next target was Athens. However, the Athenians had marched out from Athens to meet the Persians, and blocked the exits from the plains of Marathon. After several days of stalemate, the Athenians finally resolved to attack the Persians, winning a famous victory at the ensuing Battle of Marathon. After the battle, the remaining Persians fled to their ships, picked up the Eretrians from Aegilia, and then sailed back to Asia Minor, thereby ending the campaign, and the first Persian invasion of Greece.|$|E

5|$|Themistocles now {{developed}} a second strategy. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, <b>Attica</b> and the Peloponnesus) {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians; furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. However, after the Tempe debacle, it was uncertain whether the Spartans {{would be willing to}} march out from the Peloponnesus again. To persuade the Spartans to defend <b>Attica,</b> Themistocles had to show them that the Athenians were willing to do everything necessary for the success of the alliance. In short, the entire Athenian fleet must be dispatched to Artemisium.|$|E
5|$|While Philip was {{involved}} in this campaign, his allies the Acarnanians became involved in a war against Athens after the Athenians murdered two Acarnanian athletes. The Acarnanians complained to Philip about this provocation, and he decided to send a force under the command of Nicanor the Elephant to assist them in their attack on <b>Attica.</b> The Macedonians and their allies plundered and looted <b>Attica</b> before attacking Athens. The invaders made it as far as the Academy of Athens when the Roman ambassadors in the city ordered the Macedonians to retreat or to face war with Rome.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of this turmoil, {{specific}} regions in mainland Greece witnessed a dramatic population decrease, especially Boeotia, Argolis and Messenia. Mycenaean refugees migrated to Cyprus and the Levantine coast. Nevertheless, other regions {{on the edge of the}} Mycenaean world prospered, such as the Ionian islands, the northwestern Peloponnese, parts of <b>Attica</b> and a number of Aegean islands. The acropolis of Athens, oddly, appears to have avoided destruction.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1914 credits were voted {{for the creation of}} a naval aerodrome in Eleusina, <b>Attica.</b> Meanwhile, despite limited funds Aristeidis Moraitinis managed to establish the first naval aviation school and corps.

5|$|In 389 BC, the Athenians {{attacked}} {{the island of}} Aegina, {{off the coast of}} <b>Attica.</b> The Spartans soon drove off the Athenian fleet, but the Athenians continued their land assault. Under Antalcidas' command, the Spartan fleet sailed east to Rhodes but it was eventually blockaded at Abydos by the regional Athenian commanders. The Athenians on Aegina, meanwhile, soon found themselves under attack, and withdrew after several months.|$|E
5|$|Philip then ordered {{another attack}} on Athens; his army {{failed to take}} either Athens or Eleusis, but {{subjected}} <b>Attica</b> to the worst ravaging the Atticans had seen since the Persian Wars. In response, the Romans declared war on Philip and invaded his territories in Illyria. Philip was forced to abandon his Rhodian and Pergamese campaign {{in order to deal}} with the Romans and the situation in Greece. Thus began the Second Macedonian War.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} year the Persian invasion force, {{led by the}} Persian king in person, had scored victories at the battles of Thermopylae and Artemisium and conquered Thessaly, Boeotia, Euboea and <b>Attica.</b> However, at the ensuing Battle of Salamis, the Allied Greek navy had won an unlikely but decisive victory, preventing the conquest of the Peloponnesus. Xerxes then retreated with much of his army, leaving his general Mardonius to finish off the Greeks the following year.|$|E

5|$|A second {{strategy}} was therefore suggested to the Allies by Themistocles. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, <b>Attica</b> and the Peloponnesus) {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Allies, despite the overwhelming number of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the allied navy could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual {{strategy was}} adopted by the congress. However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should it come to it, while the women and children of Athens were evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{founded a}} new {{production}} company, <b>Attica,</b> and used Shepperton Studios for the shooting. Filming in England proved a difficult experience, {{as he was}} used to his own Hollywood studio and familiar crew, and no longer had limitless production time. According to Robinson, this had an effect {{on the quality of the}} film. A King in New York was released in September 1957, and received mixed reviews. Chaplin banned American journalists from its Paris première and decided not to release the film in the United States. This severely limited its revenue, although it achieved moderate commercial success in Europe. A King in New York was not shown in America until 1973.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{that the}} Greeks might attack the bridges across the Hellespont and trap his army in Europe, Xerxes {{resolved}} to do this, taking {{the greater part}} of the army with him. Mardonius handpicked the troops who were to remain with him in Greece, taking the elite infantry units and cavalry, to complete the conquest of Greece. All of the Persian forces abandoned <b>Attica,</b> however, with Mardonius over-wintering in Boeotia and Thessaly; the Athenians were thus able to return to their burnt city for the winter.|$|E

5|$|In another story, {{based on}} an old folktale-motif, and echoing a similar theme, Demeter was searching for her daughter, Persephone, having taken {{the form of an}} old woman called Doso, and {{received}} a hospitable welcome from Celeus, the King of Eleusis in <b>Attica.</b> As a gift to Celeus, because of his hospitality, Demeter planned to make his son Demophon a god, but she was unable to complete the ritual because his mother Metanira walked in and saw her son in the fire and screamed in fright, which angered Demeter, who lamented that foolish mortals do not understand the concept and ritual.|$|E
5|$|The French and British ambassadors had set {{themselves}} up at Poros and invited Constantinople {{to send a}} diplomat there so as to pursue negotiations over the status of Greece. The Porte persisted in refusing to participate in conferences. Hence, the French suggested continuing military operations and extending them into <b>Attica</b> and Euboea. The British opposed this plan. Thus {{it was left to}} the Greeks to drive out the Ottomans from these territories, with the understanding that the French army would only intervene if the Greeks found themselves in trouble.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, 479 BC, Mardonius recaptured Athens (the Allied army still {{preferring to}} guard the Isthmus). However, the Allies, under Spartan leadership, eventually agreed to try to force Mardonius to battle, and marched on <b>Attica.</b> Mardonius retreated to Boeotia to lure the Greeks into open terrain and the two sides eventually met {{near the city of}} Plataea (which had been razed the previous year). There, at the Battle of Plataea, the Greek army won a decisive victory, destroying much of the Persian army and ending the invasion of Greece; whilst at the near-simultaneous Battle of Mycale the Allied fleet destroyed much of the remaining Persian fleet.|$|E
