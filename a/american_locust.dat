50|$|The botanical area {{consist of}} the Grande Rouge, a chateau's forest park, and the Grande Ilette, a {{riverside}} area. The park is primarily oak but also contains notable trees, including cypress, a Sequoiadendron planted circa 1890-1900, and a Taxodium distichum, {{as well as}} hornbeam, beech, maple, chestnut, <b>American</b> <b>locust,</b> and Scotch fir. The Grande Ilette lies {{along the banks of}} the Indre River, and contains a meadow as well as exotic plantings of Alnus cordata, bald cypress, black walnut, and Sequoia sempervirens.|$|E

Often some {{valuable}} tree or cereal will be found in one country or locality only, {{while it may be}} adapted to many parts of the globe because of some particular character. Sometimes certain plants do even better in a new country than in the old country, for instance, the <b>American</b> <b>locust</b> tree does better in Europe than here for there it escapes the borates which so hinders its best developement here. In the last half century the work of transplanting and testing the trees, cereals and grasses of one locality or country in other localities or countries has been carried on to a great extent. In many instances this work has been performed by single individuals. For instance, people coming to this country to settle, often bring with them their favorite apple, cherry or pear. But in the United States by far the greater amount of this work, has been carried on by the department of agriculture with the co-operation of the experiment stations of the different states. The worth of this work cannot well be overestimated. It has transformed the sun burned and dust swept plains of the central west, into comfortable homes surrounded by growing crops. It has brought Kansas the soy bean, kaffir corn, sorghum, wheat and alfalfa...|$|E
40|$|The lobula giant motion {{detector}} (LGMD) is a wide-field bilateral visual interneuron in North <b>American</b> <b>locusts</b> {{that acts as}} an angular threshold detector during the approach of a solid square along a trajectory perpendicular to the long axis of the animal (Gabbiani et al., 1999 a). We investigated the dependence of this angular threshold computation on several stimulus parameters that alter the spatial and temporal activation patterns of inputs onto the dendritic tree of the LGMD, across three locust species. The same angular threshold computation was implemented by LGMD in all three species. The angular threshold computation was invariant to changes in target shape (from solid squares to solid discs) and to changes in target texture (checkerboard and con-centric patterns). Finally, the angular threshold computation did not depend on object approach angle, over at least 135 ° in the horizontal plane. A two-dimensional model of the responses of th...|$|R
50|$|Union Street {{was named}} in honor of the federal union; Liberty Street for <b>American</b> liberty. <b>Locust</b> and Plum were named for trees. Black, Taylor and Dean were named for three Blair County judges born in Williamsburg. Academy Alley borders the school property. A small cross street along {{the eastern side of the}} high school, is named Blue Pirate Street, after the school mascot.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the many}} {{features}} that have been noted {{in the study of}} our North <b>American</b> <b>locusts</b> during the past ten or a dozen years is the color-variation of the wings of the different species of lo-custs of the sub-family Œdipodinæ. As all students know who have {{had anything to do with}} these insects, some have yellow, others orange, still others red, and a very few have their wings blue. While this is true, perhaps it has not been generally noted that the presence or absence of humidity seems to have some influence upon these color-variations in the different representatives of this group that are to be met with throughout the country. That such must be the case, I think there can be no doubt. But little investigation is necessary to show that along the Atlantic slopes and even in the interior of the continent as far westward as the eastern edge of the great plains, red or orange is the characteristic color. On the plains and in other arid districts of the west and southwest the red and orange give place almost entirely to yellow. In the mountains red reappears, while at a certain elevation and under peculiar conditions blue takes the place of both. In some species we find both red- and yellow-winged individuals. There are also those in which yellow- and blue-winged individuals occur. Nor are these wing-color variations confined strictly to special genera. We find both the red and yellow appearing in species of Arphia, Hippiscus, Derotmema, Trachyrhachis, Psinidia, Lactista, Tomonotus, Dissosteira, etc.; while the blue and yellow are common to representatives of Leprus and Trimerotropis...|$|R
500|$|Operation Tonga was {{the last}} that Tetrarchs saw of active combat. During {{the first week of}} October 1944, the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment {{underwent}} an extensive reorganization, in which it was completely restructured, [...] and [...] all the remaining Tetrarchs were retired. They were replaced with the M22 Locust, a purpose-built airborne light tank of <b>American</b> design; eight <b>Locusts</b> were used by the regiment in March 1945 during Operation Varsity, the airborne operation to cross the river Rhine. A report issued by the Director (Air) of the War Office in January 1946 confirmed that the Tetrarch design was considered obsolete, and any light tanks used in post-war airborne formations would be entirely new in design. A small number of Tetrarchs remained in service with the 3rd Hussars until 1949; a Hamilcar glider flight was stationed at RAF Fairford, and a troop of Tetrarchs was kept by the regiment for training exercises with the gliders. However, glider training by the regiment was stopped in 1950 and the Tetrarchs withdrawn from service.|$|R
