Defended by the government as a reform intended to fragment ownership of media companies so as to encourage plurality of opinion, the bill was criticised by part of the opposition {{as a means to}} silence voices critical of the government, especially those in the Clarín media group (the country's largest). However, a significant amount of opposing congressmen voted in favor of the law, as they considered it was clearly an improvement on the existing one; also, the government had been willing to negotiate and modify parts of the proposed new law to improve it.|$|E
25|$|Poe {{writes about}} five periods in media history: {{the age of}} speech, the age of manuscripts, the age of print, the age of <b>audiovisual</b> <b>media</b> {{and the age of}} the Internet. He {{provides}} a detailed analysis of each under eight headings: accessibility, privacy, fidelity, volume, velocity, range, persistence and searchability. Poe writes, for example, that in the 150,000 years during which speech was the only medium or network, its accessibility was high because nearly everyone could speak and listen. Privacy, however, was low in such face-to-face communication and so too was fidelity because speech can convey only sounds, not pictures or other direct sensory information. Volume and range were also low because the unaided human voice can't carry very far or to many people, but velocity was high because speech travels at the speed of sound. Poe notes that speech is not a persistent medium because it fades away instantly, but it is searchable because what is said can remain in people's memories. He draws many conclusions from this analysis including his theory that societies dominated by speech tended to be democratized and egalitarian, but also distrustful of strangers because as a medium, speech is suited to small, tightly knit groups.|$|E

However, an EFL context lacks the social interaction which naturally occurs in an ESL context. To explore which source of language input would have a greater impact, this study investigated the effect of exposure on speaking proficiency. Two types of exposure were provided: <b>audiovisual</b> mass <b>media</b> {{as a source of}} language input in an EFL context and social interaction as a source of language input in an ESL context. A sample speaking test was administered to one hundred language learners in an EFL context (Iran) and another one hundred language learners in an ESL context (Malaysia). Then, thirty participants from each context who scored one standard deviation above and below the mean were selected as homogenous language learners. During the experiment, EFL participants had exposure to <b>audiovisual</b> mass <b>media</b> while the ESL participants were exposed to social interaction as a source of language input. At the end, both groups took another sample speaking test. The post-test showed that the EFL group performed better which was indicative of the fact that exposure to technology promotes speaking proficiency...|$|R

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} {{contribute}} to a more adequate understanding of the adoption of modern <b>audiovisual</b> mass <b>media</b> by contemporary religious groups. It does so by examining Pentecostal-charismatic churches as well as the Christian mass culture instigated by its popularity, and so-called traditional religion in Ghana, which develop markedly different attitudes towards <b>audiovisual</b> mass <b>media</b> and assume different positions in the public sphere. Taking into account the complicated entanglement of traditional religion and Pentecostalism, approaching both religions from a perspective of mediation which regards media as intrinsic to religion, and seeking to avoid the pitfall of overestimating the power of modern mass media to determine the world, this article seeks to move beyond an unproductive recurrence to oppositions such as tradition and modernity, or religion and technology. It is argued that instead of taking as a point of departure more or less set ideas about the nexus of vision and modernity, the adoption of new mass media by religious groups needs to be analyzed by a detailed ethnographic investigation of how these new media transform existing practices of religious mediation. Special emphasis is placed on the tension between the possibilities of gaining public presence through new media, and the difficulty in authorizing these media, and the experiences they induce, as authentic.
