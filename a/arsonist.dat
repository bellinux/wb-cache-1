5|$|Later in 1968 on 13 October the Museum was {{attacked}} by an <b>arsonist,</b> Timothy John Daly, who claimed he was acting in protest against the exhibition of militarism to children. He caused damage valued at approximately £200,000, not counting the loss of irreplaceable books and documents. On his conviction in 1969 {{he was sentenced to}} four years in prison.|$|E
40|$|Female-perpetrated arson is a {{topic that}} has {{received}} relatively little research attention from either psychiatrists or psychologists. In this review, available research regarding the characteristics, psychopathologies, and current treatment efforts with female <b>arsonists</b> is reviewed. Evaluation of current research with female <b>arsonists</b> suggests that very few researchers have compared female <b>arsonists</b> either to suitable female offender control groups or male arsons. Consequently, clinical knowledge and practice regarding female-perpetrated arson is underdeveloped relative to both other areas of forensic-clinical psychiatry and to knowledge of male <b>arsonists.</b> Suggestions are made for translating current research into arson interventions with female <b>arsonists.</b> Core arenas for future treatment and research provision are also highlighted...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the pattern of {{psychiatric}} morbidity in <b>arsonists</b> referred for psychiatric evaluation, and how this compares with other violent offenders. Furthermore, there is uncertainty around whether there are differences in the psychiatric morbidity of female and male <b>arsonists.</b> We investigated all <b>arsonists</b> referred for an inpatient forensic psychiatric examination in Sweden over a five-year period (1997 - 2001). Diagnostic information was collected on 214 <b>arsonists,</b> of whom 155 were men and 59 women. Principal and comorbid DSM-IV psychiatric diagnoses in these <b>arsonists</b> were compared with those of 2395 other violent offenders who received forensic psychiatric examinations over the same period. We found the most common Axis I diagnoses for individuals convicted of arson and referred for forensic psychiatric evaluation were psychotic illnesses and substance use disorders. Compared with other violent offenders referred for forensic psychiatric examinations, <b>arsonists</b> {{were more likely to be}} diagnosed with a learning disability and, in the men, Asperger's syndrome. The pattern of psychiatric morbidity in these <b>arsonists</b> did not appear to differ between women and men. We conclude that the treatment needs of <b>arsonists</b> with psychiatric morbidity primarily relate to psychotic illnesses and substance use disorders. In addition, forensic psychiatric services could consider the involvement of learning disability expertise in meeting treatment needs...|$|R
40|$|Seventy-nine <b>arsonists</b> were {{identified}} in a Special Hospital. Sixty-eight had a clinical interview which included an analysis of symptoms present {{at the time of}} the most recent fire. Mentally ill <b>arsonists</b> did not differ from Psychopathic Disorder <b>arsonists</b> in their self-report of symptoms at the time offiresetting, the major difference was in the time course of their behaviour. Mentally ill <b>arsonists</b> lit their first fire on average eight years later than did Psychopathic Disorder patients. Further analysis indicates that PD women have a distinct group of current symp-toms and behaviours...|$|R
5|$|The first Saltair {{pavilion}} {{was destroyed}} by fire on April 22, 1925. A new pavilion was built and the resort was expanded at the same location by new investors, but after years of various challenges, it was eventually destroyed by an <b>arsonist</b> in 1970.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} after Nelson's death, the state traded land for Nelson's estate, which became part of Jonathan Dickinson State Park. The site {{is now known as}} the Trapper Nelson Zoo Historic District. After the land was {{converted}} to a park, but still unopen to the public, the camp was often vandalized. One of Nelson's tool sheds was burned down; the <b>arsonist</b> attempted to burn other buildings but was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|On October 15, 1976, an <b>arsonist</b> lit a fire on {{a subway}} train at Christie station. The fire {{destroyed}} four subway cars and some wall tiles, and resulted in {{a section of the}} subway being closed for a few days. On September 19, 2007, the station modernization program was started. This program would result in making the subway system more accessible, add new bus and streetcar platforms, and improve the connections to regional buses and GO trains.|$|E
40|$|Key points: • Geographic {{profiling}} {{involves the}} analysis of crime site information to establish the most likely area of offender residence or base of operations. However, few empirical studies have investigated the spatial behaviour of <b>arsonists</b> in particular, and the findings so far about distance from base to firesetting are somewhat mixed. • Evidence about conformity with commuter subtype behaviour, {{the extent to which}} <b>arsonists</b> travel to set fires, is also mixed. <b>Arsonists</b> whose behaviour is driven by expressive motivations set fires closer to home than instrumental <b>arsonists.</b> • All existing studies are reliant on small samples, which means findings are likely to be unrepresentative of all arson offenders. Further examination of behavioural and psychological variables and their impact on the spatial behaviour of <b>arsonists</b> is required. Geographic profiling methods, computerised and empirical, require further validation...|$|R

40|$|Reports {{of gender}} {{differences}} amongst <b>arsonists</b> at psychiatric assessment are not uncommon, however some are based on relatively small samples. A new retrospective study highlighting gender differences could help to confirm or refute {{the current state of}} knowledge. The aim of the current study was to examine gender differences amongst a sample of 167 adult <b>arsonists</b> (129 males and 38 females). Infor-mation was collected from clinical records on socio-demographic, family background and childhood factors; adult adjustment; fire setting history; motives; features of pyromania and other offending, from the case notes of a group of <b>arsonists</b> referred to theWest Midlands Psychiatry Service over a 24 -year period. Female <b>arsonists</b> were older than males and {{more likely to have a}} psychiatric diagnosis. Women more frequently had a history of sexual abuse, while men had a more varied criminal background and more substance abuse problems. Our findings largely support previous research, and are discussed in this context, whilst also bringing attention to a more recently developed theory (Action System Model). Significant gender differences amongst <b>arsonists</b> indicates that different emphases in the treatment of male and female <b>arsonists</b> may be advisable, though a reliable evidence base for treatment has yet to be established...|$|R

5|$|Later, in Washington, D.C., Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are met by Phoebe Green, an {{investigator}} from London's Metropolitan Police and Mulder's former lover from Oxford University. Green explains that a serial <b>arsonist</b> is targeting the British aristocracy, burning his victims alive while leaving {{no trace of}} evidence. The only links between the crimes are the suspect's love letters to the victims' wives. His latest target is Sir Malcolm Marsden, who is visiting Cape Cod for protection after escaping an attack by the killer. Mulder and Scully visit a pyrotechnics expert who says that only rocket fuel can burn hot enough to destroy evidence of its origins.|$|E
5|$|Prior to filming, Peirce {{researched}} the facts by interviewing the people surrounding the case. She immersed {{herself in the}} information available about the murder, including trial transcripts. She met Lana Tisdel at a convenience store and interviewed her at Tisdel's home. Tisdel, who began dating Brandon just two weeks before he was murdered, was 19 {{years old at the}} time of the murders and lived in Falls City with her mother. Peirce also interviewed Tisdel's mother and Brandon's friends. However, she was unable to interview Brandon's mother or any of his biological family. Much factual information, including Nissen being a convicted <b>arsonist,</b> was incorporated into Boys Don't Cry.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that arson is common and has serious {{negative}} consequences, a lack of empirical studies is present. This article gives {{an overview of the}} Dutch empirical data on arson and <b>arsonists</b> in order to provide insight in the position of <b>arsonists</b> in the Netherlands. A large amount of arson cases remain unsolved and arson is undervalued in empirical research. The high number of unresolved cases must not be seen as the reason for this lack of empirical research. Instead, because knowledge is lacking, detection and prosecution of <b>arsonists</b> is impeded. Therefore, this study tries to increase knowledge on arson and <b>arsonists</b> by clustering available data, enabling treatment to be better tailored to this population. Results show that arson is an offence of which the perpetrators often (are suspected to) have mental problems and often are placed in forensic psychiatric hospitals. However, despite the disordered offender population, the prognosis of <b>arsonists</b> after treatment appears relatively favourable with lower recidivism rates...|$|R

Jack is arrested and when he lies to her, Marge angrily orders Wiggum to take him back to prison.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{others were}} {{also working on}} the {{development}} of sound-on-film. In 1919, the same year that DeForest received his first patents in the field, three German inventors, Josef Engl (1893–1942), Hans Vogt (1890–1979), and Joseph Massolle (1889–1957), patented the Tri-Ergon sound system. On September 17, 1922, the Tri-Ergon group gave a public screening of sound-on-film productions—including a dramatic talkie, Der Brandstifter (The <b>Arsonist)</b> —before an invited audience at the Alhambra Kino in Berlin. By the end of the decade, Tri-Ergon would be the dominant European sound system. In 1923, two Danish engineers, Axel Petersen and Arnold Poulsen, patented a system that recorded sound on a separate filmstrip running parallel with the image reel. Gaumont licensed the technology and briefly put it to commercial use under the name Cinéphone.|$|E
5|$|At {{the scene}} of Marks' game, Detective Allison Kerry finds a message for her former partner, Eric Matthews, and calls him in. Despite {{not wanting to be}} {{involved}} with the case, already dealing with a divorce and estrangement from his son Daniel, Eric reluctantly joins Kerry and Sergeant Daniel Rigg in leading a SWAT team to the factory which produced the lock from Marks' trap. There they find and apprehend John Kramer, the Jigsaw Killer, who is weak from cancer. He indicates several computer monitors showing eight people trapped in a house; <b>arsonist</b> Obi Tate, his only known survivor Amanda Young, business man Gus Colyard, gangster Jonas Singer, Laura Hunter, drug dealer Xavier Chavez, prostitute Addison Corday, and Daniel. A nerve agent filling the house will kill them within two hours, but Kramer assures Eric that following his own game, simply sitting and chatting with John, will see his son Daniel returned to him unharmed. At Kerry's urging, Eric agrees in order to buy time for the tech team to arrive and trace the video signal.|$|E
