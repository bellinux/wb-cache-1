5|$|Some Augustan historians {{argue that}} {{indications}} pointed toward his sister's son Marcellus, {{who had been}} quickly married to Augustus' daughter Julia the Elder. Other historians dispute this due to Augustus' will read <b>aloud</b> <b>to</b> the Senate while he was seriously ill in 23BC, instead indicating a preference for Marcus Agrippa, who was Augustus' second in charge and arguably {{the only one of}} his associates who could have controlled the legions and held the Empire together.|$|E
5|$|Chavrusa {{learning}} {{tends to}} be loud and animated, as the study partners read the Talmudic text and the commentaries <b>aloud</b> <b>to</b> each other and then analyze, question, debate, and defend their points of view {{to arrive at a}} mutual understanding of the text. In the heat of discussion, they may wave their hands or even shout at each other. Depending {{on the size of the}} yeshiva, dozens or even hundreds of chavrusas can be heard discussing and debating each other's opinions. One of the skills of chavrusa learning is the ability to block out all other discussions in the study hall and focus on one's study partner alone.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many girls}} of her time, Barney had a {{haphazard}} education. Her {{interest in the}} French language began with a governess who read Jules Verne stories <b>aloud</b> <b>to</b> her so {{she would have to}} learn quickly to understand them. Later she and her younger sister Laura Clifford Barney attended Les Ruches, a French boarding school in Fontainebleau, France, founded by feminist Marie Souvestre, who also founded Allenswood, in Wimbledon, outside London, which was attended by such notables as Eleanor Roosevelt. As an adult she spoke French fluently without an accent and made her home in Paris. Nearly all her published works were written in French.|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to {{determine}} how interactive read alouds effect student comprehension with the claim being that they increase comprehension scores. Through the use of observation, interviews, questionnaires, and comprehension questions, data was collected. When given questions after three read alouds and three independent readings, student comprehension scores were higher following the read alouds for below average and average readers. There was no difference in scores for the above average readers. The implications of this study include using read alouds as a support in intermediate grades, average and below average readers preferring read <b>alouds</b> <b>to</b> independent reading, and using interactive read <b>alouds</b> <b>to</b> help engage students and enhance the discussion of text...|$|R

5|$|The Queen's Baton Relay, is a relay {{around the}} world held prior to the {{beginning}} of the Commonwealth Games. The Baton carries a message from the Head of the Commonwealth, currently Queen Elizabeth II. The Relay traditionally begins at Buckingham Palace in London as a part of the city's Commonwealth Day festivities. The Queen entrusts the baton to the first relay runner. At the Opening Ceremony of the Games, the final relay runner hands the baton back to the Queen or her representative, who reads the message <b>aloud</b> <b>to</b> officially open the Games.The Queen's Baton Relay is similar to the Olympic Torch Relay.|$|E
5|$|The {{format of}} the Super Quiz {{differs from that of}} the other subject areas. Added in 1969, it offers a {{culminating}} championship event. The Super Quiz consisted of a forty-question multiple choice test as well as a relay round until 2013. In 2013, the multiple-choice portion was eliminated and the relay portion expanded to include six of the objective subjects. Generally referred to as the Super Quiz Relay, it is the only event viewable by the general public. The relay starts with the Varsity students, followed by the Scholastic and the Honors students. Each group is given 10 or 15 questions, depending on the format decided by the state coordinator. These questions are read <b>aloud</b> <b>to</b> the audience and are printed or projected for the competitors. After the questions and answers are read, the students are allowed seven seconds to select the correct answer. The answer is checked on the spot by a judge and scores are immediately displayed to the audience.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Mavis starts dating {{the equally}} shy Jerry Booth (Graham Haberfield), {{but it remains}} platonic. Jerry dies {{of a heart attack}} in 1975 before being able to express his romantic intentions. She meets {{salesman}} Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin) the following year. They date, but the relationship is strained by Derek's interfering mother, who believes that Mavis is not good enough for her son. The relationship remains non-committal until 1983, when another man competes for Mavis's hand, the artistic Victor Pendlebury (Christopher Coll). Mavis is torn as she likes both but chooses Derek in the end. On their wedding day in 1984 Mavis has second thoughts about marrying Derek and jilts him at the altar. Her guilt turns to indignation when she learns that Derek– feeling the same way she does– did not attend the ceremony either. Derek goes on to an unhappy marriage with Angela Hawthorne (Diane Fletcher), but in 1986 he begins wooing Mavis again, realizing he made a mistake when he let her go. Mavis eventually decides Derek is the man for her and the couple marry in September 1988. The other residents of Coronation Street consider Mavis and Derek something of a joke, but neither care as they are genuinely in love. They spend evenings reading <b>aloud</b> <b>to</b> each other and discussing the events of the day. They remain happy despite the occasional problem, but their happiness is cut short in 1997 when Derek dies suddenly of a heart attack after a road rage incident. Devastated, at his funeral Mavis chastises those who mocked her marriage over the years.|$|E

40|$|English Language Learners (ELLs) are {{a growing}} {{population}} in today???s schools. Vocabulary acquisition {{is critical in}} an ELL???s language development and is often rushed and overlooked in daily instruction. The lack of sufficient vocabulary development and instruction {{can lead to a}} student???s inability to comprehend grade level text. The purpose of this mixed methods study was to identify the effectiveness of interactive read alouds in vocabulary acquisition and reading comprehension of English Language Learners. Two third grade classrooms were studied during 6 weeks of instruction. In the control group, the teacher only used the adopted curriculum during Language Arts instruction. In the treatment group, the teacher used interactive read <b>alouds</b> <b>to</b> teach the weekly vocabulary and comprehension strategies and skills. Each week both classes took the weekly selection tests, which assessed the students??? comprehension of the story and the understanding of the vocabulary words. To further support the research, an outside observer came in during read aloud instruction in the treatment group to note the students??? performance and progress, and students were given a survey to determine their opinion of reading aloud in the classroom. Students in the treatment growth showed more significant growth in the areas of reading comprehension and vocabulary acquisition. It is concluded that using interactive read <b>alouds</b> <b>to</b> teach vocabulary in context and model comprehension strategies greatly improves an English Language Learner???s academic success...|$|R
