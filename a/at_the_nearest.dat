5|$|The game {{features}} a changing weather system, which will vary from every hour and will provide obstructions for various forces and installations. For example, fog will close runways whereas storms will temporarily disrupt bombing runs and dogfights. Over time, RAF squadrons {{will run out}} of ammunition or fuel, and thus must replenish <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> RAF station, which will render them vulnerable to a Luftwaffe bombing run. In between turns, the player {{has the opportunity to}} request reinforcements from RAF reserves, however the longer the campaign progresses, the quality of the reserves will diminish.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{cover system}} allows players to move between cover, to fire blindly, aim freely, and target a {{specific}} enemy. Individual body parts {{can also be}} targeted. Melee attacks include additional moves, such as dodging, blocking, disarming an opponent and counter-attacking. Body armour {{can be used to}} absorb gunshots and explosive damage, but is used up in the process. When health is entirely depleted, gameplay stops, and players respawn <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> hospital.|$|E

5|$|For Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe Hermann Göring it was {{an ongoing}} concern that {{inadequate}} numbers of fighters were able to continually engage the bomber streams, {{at the very time}} that the USAAF's 8th Air Force's new commander, Maj. Gen. Jimmy Doolittle had instituted a new fighter strategy against the Luftwaffe. Hence on 23 February 1944 — near the midpoint of the USAAF's Big Week bomber offensive against the Luftwaffe, also being carried out by the 15th Air Force flying out of Italian bases — Generalmajor Joseph Schmid Commander of I. Jagdkorps established a new rule for the fighters returning to base. They were to arrive <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> designated fighter airfield for resupply instead of returning to their own base. They were to be commanded by the senior pilot landing on that airfield, irrespective of their unit. This was meant to turn around the fighters in time to intercept returning bombers.|$|E
5|$|Ions {{typically}} pack into extremely regular crystalline structures, in {{an arrangement}} that minimizes the lattice energy (maximizing attractions and minimizing repulsions). The lattice energy is the summation of the interaction of all sites with all other sites. For unpolarizable spherical ions only the charges and distances are required to determine the electrostatic interaction energy. For any particular ideal crystal structure, all distances are geometrically related to the smallest internuclear distance. So for each possible crystal structure, the total electrostatic energy {{can be related to}} the electrostatic energy of unit charges <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> neighbour distance by a multiplicative constant called the Madelung constant that can be efficiently computed using an Ewald sum. When a reasonable form is assumed for the additional repulsive energy, the total lattice energy can be modelled using the Born–Landé equation, the Born–Mayer equation, or in the absence of structural information, the Kapustinskii equation.|$|E
5|$|Quainton Road {{station was}} built on a curve in the line <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> point to the Duke's estates at Wotton. Six miles (10km) {{northwest}} of Aylesbury, it was southwest of the small village of Quainton and immediately northwest of the road connecting Quainton to Akeman Street. The railway towards Aylesbury crossed the road via a level crossing immediately southeast of the station. The Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway {{had spent most of}} their limited budget on the construction of the line itself. Details of the design of the original Quainton Road station are lost, but {{it is likely that the}} station had a single timber-covered earth platform and minimal buildings; it was described in 1890 as being extremely primitive.|$|E

5|$|Through {{combat and}} quest completion, {{characters}} gain experience points, which raise experience level. When {{the main character}} is killed in battle, the party respawns <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> town, and a headstone appears where they fell which contains some of the experience points gained during battles up to that point. Experience points are lost with each death, although the character does not lose experience levels. Other playable characters raise experience levels quicker depending on the player character's own level. Upon each level up, a character is granted three statistic points, which can be distributed by the player to increase a character attribute: these include maximum health. Ability points are also given, which are allocated to skills related to different weapons and abilities such as spells and passive buffs and debuffs. These skills are maxed out at Level 20.|$|E
5|$|In 1392 however, Carrouges {{was present}} {{for one of}} the more notorious occurrences in fourteenth century France; the first descent into madness of King Charles VI. As a chevalier d'honneur, Carrouges {{accompanied}} the King on campaign and thus was present when the Royal Army entered Brittany to hunt for Pierre de Craon, a noble who had fled Paris following a failed attempt to murder Olivier de Clisson, Constable of France. As the army passed Le Mans on 8 August 1392, a loud noise within his entourage startled the French King, who believing himself to be under attack, lashed out <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> person to him. The man happened to be his brother Louis of Valois, who turned and fled from his brother's sword. Killing several pages who attempted to calm his temper, the King set off on full pursuit of Louis, leaving the army strung out across the countryside behind him. The pursuit continued for hours until the exhausted King was eventually subdued by his bodyguard, including Jean de Carrouges.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the effects on upper limb and lower back muscles activities during prolonged sitting in two different work area boundaries. The effects are measured from the muscle activities of subjects performing two repetitive tasks <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>near</b> work area boundary and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> far work area boundary. Subjects consisted of 10 males (age 27. 7 +/- 5. 42) and 10 females (age 27. 5 +/- 5. 91) with no history of musculoskeletal injury or back problem <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of participation. Surface electromyography (sEMG) signal were recorded from the right and left Levator Scapulae, Upper Trapezius, Anterior Deltoid and Erector Spinae which are known as the weaken and tighten muscles due to musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). The EMG signal was processed and normalized in the form of % MVC for analysis. The overall results indicated that muscle activities in the upper limb and lower back increased significantly when performing work <b>at</b> <b>the</b> far work area boundary. The most active muscle is the Left Erector Spinae (2. 37 % MVC <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>near,</b> 2. 91 % MVC <b>at</b> <b>the</b> far work area boundary), while the lowest active muscle is the Left Anterior Deltoid (0. 09 % MVC <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>near,</b> 0. 13 % MVC <b>at</b> <b>the</b> far work area boundary). <b>The</b> muscle activity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> far work area boundary is on average 17 % greater than <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>near</b> work area boundary. Females showed greater muscular activity compared to males <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>near</b> (average difference, 1. 28 % MVC) and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> far work area boundary (average difference, 1. 56 % MVC). The result of independent sample t-test showed significant differences on muscle activities <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>near</b> and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> far work area boundary between males and females. The results above indicate the importance to predict the muscle activity and time to fatigue. A regression equation model to predict muscle activity and time to fatigue is developed in this research...|$|R
