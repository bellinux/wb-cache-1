The principle can then be true only in an abstract theoretical model, but not in reality. Yet, if that classical revolutionary orthodox core principle is not true in reality, then it seems to follow there cannot be any systematic relationship in the real world between the Marxist labor-values and the actual price-levels for products – which was precisely what critics argued during the 20th century about the insolubility of the transformation problem.

There is no consensus about that issue among mathematicians and computer scientists, although the main trend is now toward probabilistic analysis and vector algebra. Many mathematical Marxists have abandoned Marx's analysis of the equalization of the rate of profit and Marx's concept of production prices, arguing that an analysis of input-output data can straightforwardly prove a strong, robust positive correlation between product-prices and employee hours worked. They argue, with Marx, that a uniform profit rate does not exist in reality, but against Marx that, therefore, a tendency for differences in profit rates to be levelled out by competition does not exist either.

40|$|Private sector {{governance}} arrangements have been imported into UK public bodies {{under the influence}} of New Public Management reforms. This paper draws on a cohort study of 14 public bodies to assess the appropriateness of this practice and the impact of fiscal austerity during the study period of 2010 – 16. Based on multiple sources, including interviews with Chairs and Chief Executives, it shows that, though similar to private corporate Boards in appearance, public Boards are often excluded from the strategy role. They are also vulnerable to the elastic definition of policy over which Ministers assert dominance, thereby blurring accountability. It demonstrates the tension between vertical accountability to government principals and horizontal accountability to stakeholders. During the study window, public bodies were abolished, broken up, merged, reconfigured or taken back into core government, as the UK Government imposed austerity measures {{to reduce the size of}} the fiscal deficit and to diminish government roles in delivery, financing and regulation of public services. Surviving public bodies in the study suffered deep budget cuts and less autonomy from central control. These findings are interpreted as evidence of the re-territorialisation of the UK public sector, with accruals accounting and <b>accounting</b> <b>consolidation</b> practices playing a facilitating role...|$|E
40|$|Cooperativist integration, {{an example}} of the sixth {{cooperative}} principle of inter-cooperation, means the concentration of cooperative enterprises. Of the different means of organization that are covered by the legislation on cooperatives, cooperative groups appear to be a similar concept to that of groups of corporations. However, there are actually {{significant differences between the two}} concepts due to the very nature of cooperative groups in the light of the cooperative formula as an independent entity. This paper analyses, on the one hand, to what degree it would be possible to transfer the principles that govern groups of corporations to the concept of cooperative groups and, on other hand, in what conditions and under what assumptions a cooperative enterprise could be a member of a mixed group consisting of cooperatives and other types of corporation. Our second objective will then be to determine, in this case, the requirements in terms of preparing consolidated annual accounts, if cooperative enterprises could be brought within the scope of consolidation, especially as a result of the new concept of “horizontal groups”, which has arisen as a consequence of the modification of company legislation in Spain prior to its adaptation to international accounting legislation.

40|$|The UK {{government}} {{made a commitment}} to produce a consolidated set of public sector accruals-based accounts, known as Whole of Government Accounts (WGA), as a component of its accounting reforms, eg Resource Accounting and Budgeting (RAB). This requirement was mandated by the Government Resources and Accounts Act (2000). The government has claimed that WGA is needed for the following reasons: (1) to assist in macroeconomic and fiscal planning; (2) to achieve greater accountability and transparency of public finances; and (3) to provide widespread improvement in accounting information systems across the public sector. This report documents the history and development of WGA and considers the degree of progress to date in realising the claims made for such a consolidated public sector accounting system. In assessing the role of WGA in macroeconomic and fiscal planning, the report highlights a number of compatibility issues arising from the use of GAAP as the underlying accounting basis. It also examines the motives behind the tradition of using (consolidated) accounting in the private sector in order not only to assess the practical capacity of an accruals-based WGA but also to identify the likely users of WGA accounting information. Concerning the claim that WGA will improve accountability of public sector finances through greater accounting transparency, the report points to a number of unresolved problems, including inconsistencies in accounting for certain public sector assets and liabilities and debates over the limits of the WGA consolidation boundary. The report also shows that a number of these issues have also proved problematic in other countries more experienced in WGA, such as Australia and New Zealand, raising questions about how much has been learned at the international level in this area of development and reform. The report presents evidence of improvements in public sector accounting systems, with the consolidation process required by WGA acting as a catalyst, stimulating change at the departmental level - particularly in terms of the collection and recording of financial data. What impact this has had in terms of improved governmental decision making, however, is an open question, the answer to which depends upon the long-term practical operation of WGA systems. The research findings lead to the conclusion that WGA {{appears to have been a}} tool to instill the discipline of accounting across the public sector, rather than its supposed role of improving macroeconomic management and governmental accountability processes. The deadlines for the publication of WGA have been extended on a number of occasions (no full WGA accounts have yet been published by the UK government), thus there are limits to the assessment of the practical outcomes of WGA. Nevertheless, the planned scale of the project (it is said to be the biggest ever governmental <b>accounting</b> <b>consolidation</b> project), the major claims that have been (and continue to be) made for it and the continuing delay over full implementation certainly warrant the type of independent review and analysis provided here. Ten years after the initial official governmental study first advocated WGA, this report offers a thorough and timely insight into such a 'grand design' project. The findings are of both national and international relevance. Certainly it would be prudent for countries considering the implementation of similar consolidated public sector accounting systems to ensure that they have absorbed the lessons from the experiences of 'pioneer' countries, and given careful consideration to the relative costs, benefits and practical achievements of such reforms...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the association between the use of a computerised learning tool (specifically designed to teach <b>consolidation</b> <b>accounting)</b> and student performance in the final examination of an undergraduate accounting unit on Corporate Accounting. Design/methodology/approach – A regression model was developed to analyse 1, 103 observations of assignment and examination scores, collected over three semesters, to test the central proposition that computer assisted learning enhances student learning outcomes and performance in the exam. Findings – The results show a positive and significant relationship between the computerised accounting assignment on consolidated accounting (linked to usage of the computerised tool) and the consolidation question in the final examination. The findings suggest that the computerised <b>consolidation</b> <b>accounting</b> package (CCAP) assists students to understand the concepts underpinning <b>consolidation</b> <b>accounting.</b> Research limitations/implications – The data were collected from a single institution, which may not represent the population of accounting students. Due to ethical obligations, the study lacked a control group that would have allowed meaningful comparison and assessment of student performance. Furthermore, whilst the findings in this study were able to demonstrate a positive association between the CCAP and exam performance, it is unable to determine the quality and depth of the learning experience from using the CCAP. Practical implications – The present study found that a CCAP and its usage has the potential to positively impact student performance on assessment tasks on subject matter similar to concepts contained the computer package. Such findings may encourage instructors to seek ways of incorporating learning technologies in the pedagogical design. Originality/value – This is believed to be one the few papers that has exclusively studied the impact of a specific CCAP and a specific segment in <b>accounting</b> education (<b>consolidation</b> <b>accounting)</b> using direct measures, CCAP assignment score and the final examination score for a question dedicated to <b>consolidation</b> <b>accounting.</b> <br /...|$|R

In order to discuss the different opinions regarding the consolidation theories we used the descriptive approach.

The results of the study suggest that every theory has certain aspects which differentiate it from the others in terms of recognition of subsidiary income and reporting net assets of the subsidiary. However, from all theories analyzed, the entity theory takes into account several guidelines of maximum importance when preparing consolidated financial statements: “You can’t own yourself!”, “You can’t owe yourself money!”, “You can’t make money selling to yourself. ...|$|R

In {{the first half of}} this paper, we review research on the spacing effect that has employed spaces of 24 h or more across skill-related tasks, language-related tasks and generalization for adults and children. Throughout this review, we distinguish between learning and retention by defining learning (or acquisition) as performance at the end of training and retention as performance after a delay period. Using this distinction, we find age- and task-related differences in the manifestation of the spacing effect over long timescales. In the second half of this paper, we discuss a reconsolidation account of the spacing effect.
