25|$|After the Emperor's death, Prime Minister Li Si, who {{accompanied}} him, became extremely {{worried that the}} news of his death could trigger a general uprising in the Empire. It would take two months for the entourage to reach the capital, {{and it would not}} be possible to stop the uprising. Li Si decided to hide the death of the Emperor, and return to Xianyang. Most of the Imperial entourage accompanying the Emperor were left ignorant of the Emperor's death; only a younger son, Ying Huhai, who was travelling with his father, the eunuch Zhao Gao, Li Si, and five or six favourite eunuchs knew of the death. Li Si also ordered that two carts containing rotten fish be carried immediately before and after the wagon of the Emperor. The idea behind this was to prevent people from noticing the foul smell emanating from the wagon of the Emperor, where his body was starting to decompose severely as it was summertime. They also pulled down the shade so no one could see his face, changed his clothes daily, brought food and when he had to have important conversations, they would act <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> send them a message.|$|E
500|$|In his 2011 book The Man Behind the Man: Looking From the Inside Out, Demetrius Smith Sr., {{a former}} member of R. Kelly's entourage, wrote that R. Kelly told him [...] "in a voice that sounded <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> burst into tears" [...] that he thought Aaliyah was pregnant.|$|E
2500|$|They {{were walking}} along the {{promenade}} when the 25-year-old Italian anarchist Luigi Lucheni approached them, attempting to peer underneath the empress's parasol. According to Sztáray, as the ship's bell announced the departure, Lucheni seemed to stumble and made a movement with his hand <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> maintain his balance. In reality, {{in an act of}} [...] "propaganda of the deed", he had stabbed Elisabeth with a sharpened needle file that was [...] long (used to file the eyes of industrial needles) that he had inserted into a wooden handle.|$|E
6000|$|... [SIGSBY enters. SIGSBY is a dapper little man, very brisk and bustling--hirsute--looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> dusting, {{cleaning}} up generally.] ...|$|R
6000|$|His hands moved uneasily, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> them {{to remove}} some {{obstruction}} that weighed upon him. Two {{or three times}} there fell from him some broken words,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{like the}} Marquess of Grandgoût so much! I hope {{he will be}} {{elevated}} in the peerage: <b>he</b> looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> it so! Poor dear man!" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "My {{last meeting}} with Abdus Salam {{was only three}} months ago. His disease had taken its toll and {{he was unable to}} talk. Yet he {{understood}} what was said. I told him about the celebration held in Pakistan on his seventieth birthday. He kept staring at me. He had risen above praise. As I rose to leave he pressed my hand to express his feelings <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> thank everyone who had said kind words about him. Dr. Abdus Salam had deep love for Pakistan {{in spite of the fact}} that he was treated unfairly and indifferently by his own country. It became more and more difficult for him to come to Pakistan and this hurt him deeply. Now he has returned home finally, to rest in peace for ever in the soil that he loved so much. May be in the years to come we will rise above our prejudice and own him and give him, after his death, what we could not when he was alive. We Pakistanis may choose to ignore Dr. Salam, but the world at large will always remember him." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{this threat}} the mate glared at Tom <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> eat the boy up.|$|E
60|$|Then Adam hurried on, {{speaking}} with a rush, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{come to the}} crucial point.|$|E
60|$|Louis took it, but <b>he</b> still sat <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> {{another to}} speak. It seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would not open it unless the proud Shirley deigned to show herself {{interested}} in the exhibition.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} Baldassarre {{with a wide}} glance of mysterious meaning, taking the baby from him again, and almost wishing he would {{question}} her <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> very much to know more.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{touch of}} the rheumatics in my back," [...] said the Sergeant, in a loud voice, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> some third person to hear us. [...] "We shall have {{a change in the}} weather before long." ...|$|R
60|$|Marc {{showed no}} hesitation, nor {{anything}} we expected. He stood stiff-legged, and looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> fight.|$|E
60|$|He looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> cry {{but thought}} better of it and bit off a mouthful of candy.|$|E
60|$|He {{kept his}} eyes fixed on her, and there was a faintly {{perceptible}} motion of the lips, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> speak.|$|E
6000|$|Eustace came too, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> the {{amusement}} and yet was ashamed to take it, when he exclaimed, [...] "I say, Harry; isn't this the book {{father used to}} tell us about--that they used to look over?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did not," [...] Miss Jardine admitted. [...] "I thought I wouldn't {{spoil the}} plot. It looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> {{an excuse for}} meeting us again, but I think I wronged him. That sudden stop was genuine." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could hardly}} have {{imagined}} dear old Joe looking so unlike himself or so like some extraordinary bird; standing as he did speechless, with his tuft of feathers ruffled, and his mouth open <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> a worm.|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{much will}} you give?" [...] whispered {{the other in}} reply, leaning over, and looking <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hush up the pawnbroker.|$|E
60|$|He lingered {{with them}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see that vision again, {{but only the}} {{caretaker}} appeared, and promised to take the flowers upstairs.|$|E
60|$|For {{the moment}} Captain Grady was speechless. His face grew dark with {{gathering}} wrath, {{and he looked}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> eat some one up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, but I soon saw something," [...] {{continued}} Archie, {{with increasing}} solemnity; [...] "I saw Kateegoose coming slinking round among the carts, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> {{not to be}} seen. I saw him only for a moment--gliding past like a ghost." ...|$|R
60|$|After riding {{for some}} time, Rollo's mother, upon looking {{back towards the}} wagon, saw that Rollo was making signs <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> them to stop. She told Mr. Holiday, and he {{accordingly}} stopped his horse, and waited until the wagon came up. Rollo had a plan to propose.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{join you}} on the trail," [...] said Dillon, who remarked that Stannard implied that he hesitated to go. Stannard had said {{something}} like that before, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> others {{to note that the}} plan was not his. All the same, it was not important, and Dillon took Laura's hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mayn't I {{come down}} with you?" [...] added Sam, looking at him <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{make the most of}} every moment of that presence.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{does that}} bird mean by calling 'Hurry up, hurry up?' He keeps flying before us, and looking back <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> show me something." ...|$|E
60|$|The Colonel {{was thrown}} into utter confusion. And when Miss Hill turned terrible eyes upon him, poor Pepper looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> sink through the porch.|$|E
50|$|The Full House {{inhabitants}} {{all live}} under the same roof, {{and it seems that}} everything is okay. But that doesn't last for long. The owner of the apartment appears <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to sell it. Tamara saves them by buying the apartment. She leases it to the Full House inhabitants, along with certain conditions.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, nor he woon't hev the stick, {{whether you}} want it or no," [...] pursued Dagley, {{throwing}} out his voice, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> it to hit hard. [...] "You've got no call to come an' talk about sticks o' these primises, as you woon't give a stick tow'rt mending. Go to Middlemarch to ax for your charrickter." ...|$|R
50|$|It is {{not because}} he wishes to fulfill his senses, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> only <b>wants</b> to have the worldly things.|$|R
60|$|Dick {{could not}} see into the office, but heard the purser open a drawer and shuffle some papers, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get rid of his questioner.|$|E
60|$|A {{little later}} Dave and Roger left the mansion, Philip Chesterfield bidding them a formal good-bye. Nick Jasniff was sullen and looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> kill both boys.|$|E
60|$|This {{prospect}} {{seemed to}} set John's mind {{more than ever}} on Helen, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> talk over her brother's conduct with her, and was imagining her sentiments on it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Gilbert was in {{the garden}} with us when we were told he {{was in the}} house. Poor fellow, he shuddered, and looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> me to guard him, so I sent him out walking with Maurice while I went in, and found Lucy {{entertaining}} the gentleman. I made myself as cold and inhospitable as I could, but I am afraid he rather relishes a dignified retenue.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] said Sylvester, coolly, [...] "only {{another one}} of those playful homicidal freaks {{peculiar}} to the country. A man was shot by Cherokee Jack over at Lagrange this morning, and that was the sheriff of Calaveras and his posse hunting him. I told him I'd seen nobody but you and your friend. By the way, I hope the cursed noise hasn't disturbed him. The poor fellow looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{want to be}} soup!" [...] wailed Button-Bright again; and Toto {{began to}} whine dismally, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> didn't <b>want</b> to be soup, either.|$|R
