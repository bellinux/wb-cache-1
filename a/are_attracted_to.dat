5|$|The {{electrons}} of an atom <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> the protons in {{an atomic}} nucleus by this electromagnetic force. The protons and neutrons in the nucleus <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> {{each other by}} a different force, the nuclear force, which is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force repelling the positively charged protons from one another. Under certain circumstances, the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force, and nucleons can be ejected from the nucleus, leaving behind a different element: nuclear decay resulting in nuclear transmutation.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} pollinators have been {{recorded}} visiting the flower spikes, including New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), native and European honey bees, wasps and ants. The flower spikes drip nectar onto the ground or lower leaves, suggesting pollination by nonflying mammals, which <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> the scent. Being upside down may facilitate this process.|$|E

50|$|In The 16 Strivings for God Reiss {{develops}} {{the theory that}} people embrace religion because it provides them with opportunities to satisfy all 16 basic desires both in strong form and in weak form. For example, {{a person with a}} weak basic desire for social contact might <b>be</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> religious retreats, while a person with a strong basic desire for Social Contact might <b>be</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> religious festivals. A person with a weak basic desire for Vengeance might <b>be</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> passages in scriptures that speak of peace and forgiveness, while a person with a strong basic desire for Vengeance might <b>be</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> passages that speak of revenge.|$|R

5|$|Numerous nectar-feeding insects <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> {{the flower}} spikes, {{which in turn}} attract honeyeaters, {{silvereyes}} and sunbirds, many of which consume both nectar and insects. The sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) forages among the flower spikes and is a probable pollinator. The common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis) feeds on nectar. B.dentata has been recorded as a host plant for the mistletoe species Amyema benthamii, Decaisnina angustata and D.signata.|$|E
5|$|Procellariids are {{vulnerable}} to other threats as well. Ingestion of plastic flotsam {{is a problem for}} the family as it is for many other seabirds. Once swallowed, this plastic can cause a general decline in the fitness of the bird, or in some cases lodge in the gut and cause a blockage, leading to death by starvation. Procellariids are also vulnerable to general marine pollution, as well as oil spills. Some species, such as the Barau's petrel, the Newell's shearwater or the Cory's shearwater, which nest high up on large developed islands are victims of light pollution. Chicks that are fledging <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> streetlights and are unable to reach the sea. An estimated 20–40% of fledging Barau's petrels <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> the streetlights on Réunion.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-The {{responses}} of Ips pini (Scolytidae) to multiple-funnel traps baited with the pheromone, ipsdienol, and various monoterpenes were deter-mined in stands of lodgepole pine in southern and central British Columbia. Ips pini <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> both ipsdienol and P-phellandrene, demonstrating that @-phellandrene is a kairomone for this species. Lasconotus complex (Col-ydiidae) and a Corticeus sp. (Tenebrionidae) <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> both ipsdienol and @-phellandrene. The Corticeus sp. exhibited a synergistic {{response to the}} combination of ipsdienol and @-phellandrene; the {{responses of}} the other two species to the combination were additive. The predators, Thanasimus unda-tulus, Enoclerus sphegeus, and E. lecontei (Cleridae), <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> ips-dienol-baited traps, while Monochamus clamator (Cerambycidae) and Dendroctonus ponderosae (Scolytidae) <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to,</b> 6 -phellandrene. Attraction of all eight species increased with increasing release rates of ips-dienol and/or / 3 -phellandrene...|$|R
5|$|Adults of {{most species}} of mole cricket can fly powerfully, if not with agility, but males do so infrequently. The females {{typically}} take wing soon after sunset, and <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> areas where males are calling, {{which they do}} {{for about an hour}} after sunset. This may be in order to mate, or they may be influenced by the suitability of the habitat for egg-laying, as demonstrated by the number of males present and calling in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|At {{a variety}} of elevations, meadows provide important, {{productive}} habitat for wildlife. Animals come to feed on the green grasses and use the flowing and standing water found in many meadows. Predators, in turn, <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> these areas. The interface between meadow and forest is also favored by many animal species because of the proximity of open areas for foraging and cover for protection. Species that are highly dependent upon meadow habitat include great grey owl, willow flycatcher, Yosemite toad, and mountain beaver.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, James E. Lloyd's {{investigation}} of female fireflies {{of the genus}} Photuris revealed they emit the same light signals that females of the genus Photinus use as a mating signal. Further research showed male fireflies from several different genera <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> these mimics, and are subsequently captured and eaten. Female signals are based on that received from the male, each female having a repertoire of signals matching the delay and duration of the female of the corresponding species. This mimicry may have evolved from non-mating signals that have become modified for predation.|$|E

5|$|Bulls have a loud vocalization {{consisting}} of screams known as bugling, {{which can be}} heard for miles. Bugling {{is often associated with}} an adaptation to open environments such as parklands, meadows, and savannas, where sound can travel great distances. Females <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> the males that bugle more often and have the loudest call. Bugling is most common early and late in the day {{and is one of the}} most distinctive sounds in nature, akin to the howl of the gray wolf.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that barotrauma is causing bat fatalities around wind turbines. Bats have typical mammalian lungs, which {{are thought to}} be more sensitive to sudden air pressure changes than the lungs of birds, making them more liable to fatal rupture. In addition, {{it has been suggested that}} bats <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> these structures, perhaps seeking roosts, and thereby increasing the death rate. Acoustic deterrents may help to reduce bat mortality at wind farms.|$|E
5|$|Female moths <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> {{flowering}} soybean fields. The {{most severe}} infestations occur between flowering and when pods become fully developed. Large-scale outbreak {{is associated with}} time of peak flowering, when most pods are developed, and peak moth flight, for giant. Moths are also attracted to drought stressed soybeans or fields with poor growth. Dry weather leads to quick drying of corn plants, compelling moths to leave and seek other hosts. Heavy rainfall also decreases corn earworm populations because it drowns pupae in their soil chambers, limits moth flight, washes eggs from leaves, and creates favorable conditions for fungal diseases that kill caterpillars.|$|E

500|$|In Munster, stress <b>is</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> a long vowel or diphthong in {{the second}} or third {{syllable}} of a word, e.g. [...] ('girl'), [...] ('request'). In the now-extinct accent of East Mayo, stress <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> a long vowel or diphthong {{in the same way as}} in Munster; in addition, stress <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> a short vowel before word-final ll, m, or nn when that word was also final in its utterance. For example, [...] ('horse') was pronounced [...] in isolation or as the last word of a sentence, but as [...] in the middle of a sentence.|$|R

5|$|The {{electrons}} in an atom <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> the protons in the nucleus by the electromagnetic force. This force binds the {{electrons in}}side an electrostatic potential well surrounding the smaller nucleus, {{which means that}} an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape. The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force. Hence electrons bound {{near the center of}} the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations.|$|E
5|$|Ørsted did {{not fully}} {{understand}} his discovery, but he observed the effect was reciprocal: a current exerts a force on a magnet, and a magnetic field exerts a force on a current. The phenomenon was further investigated by Ampère, who discovered that two parallel current-carrying wires exerted a force upon each other: two wires conducting currents {{in the same direction}} <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> each other, while wires containing currents in opposite directions are forced apart. The interaction is mediated by the magnetic field each current produces and forms the basis for the international definition of the ampere.|$|E
5|$|Although sawgrass and sloughs are the {{enduring}} geographical icons of the Everglades, other ecosystems {{are just as}} vital, and the borders marking them are subtle or nonexistent. Pinelands and tropical hardwood hammocks are located throughout the sloughs; the trees, rooted in soil inches above the peat, marl, or water, support a variety of wildlife. The oldest and tallest trees are cypresses, whose roots are specially adapted to grow underwater {{for months at a}} time. The Big Cypress Swamp is well known for its 500-year-old cypresses, though cypress domes can appear throughout the Everglades. As the fresh water from Lake Okeechobee makes its way to Florida Bay, it meets salt water from the Gulf of Mexico; mangrove forests grow in this transitional zone, providing nursery and nesting conditions for many species of birds, fish, and invertebrates. The marine environment of Florida Bay is also considered part of the Everglades because its sea grasses and aquatic life <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> the constant discharge of fresh water.|$|E
