Theexperiment was carried out in half-operation conditions experimental base ofDepartment of Poultry Science and Small Animal Husbandry of Slovak Universityof Agriculture in Nitra. A total of 60 one day old ducklings (type Peking DuckWhite) were randomly divided to 2 housing groups: three-floor cage system anddeep litter system, both under uniform microclimate conditions. The housingsystem, slaughter age and sex significantly affected the slaughter weights ofbroiler ducks in 49 and 56 day of fattening. The results of this study showed the influenceof housing system, sex and slaughter <b>age</b> <b>on</b> <b>slaughter</b> and carcass parameters.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the carcass component yields and meat proximate composition of 2 rabbit genetic types (Californian and hybrid New Zealand Red×Californian), with 5 rabbits per genetic type being slaughtered every 2 wk throughout the study period (9 - 17 wk) to evaluate the effect of <b>age</b> <b>on</b> these traits. <b>Slaughter</b> weight, reference yield, portion yield (hind leg, foreleg and fore part, as percentage of slaughter weight), meat yield, skin weight and the fat content of the meat (percentage of wet weight) increased significantly with age, while the full gastrointestinal tract, liver, head and feet decreased significantly. This is likely {{a reflection of the}} early-maturing nature of bone and viscera and later maturing nature of muscle and fat. These results indicate that delaying slaughter to 13 wk tends to improve yields for valuable carcass components. The Californian had a significantly higher total meat yield at 11 and 17 wk and higher portion meat yields at 9 (hind leg), 11 (hind leg and fore part) and 13 (foreleg) weeks than the hybrid. This was likely due to the later maturation of the hybrid and the influence of the New Zealand Red on carcass quality. It therefore appears that the Californian may be more favourable for meat production, from a carcass and meat quality perspective...|$|R

40|$|Male {{broilers}} {{were used}} to evaluate the effects of different energy levels in finisher diets and <b>age</b> of <b>slaughter</b> <b>on</b> performance, production pattern and carcass yield. Experimental design was a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement: energy level (ME) in the finisher diet (3, 200 and 3, 600 kcal ME/kg) and age of slaughter (42, 49 and 56 days), resulting in six treatments with four replicates. The finisher diet was fed only in the last week of the growing period. Characteristics evaluated were feed consumption (FC), body weight gain (WG), feed conversion (FC), energy intake (EI), caloric conversion (CC), efficiency production index, production pattern, and carcass yield. The results showed better WG and CC for broilers fed 3, 200 kcal ME/kg finisher diet. Broilers slaughtered at 42 and 49 days of age had better performance and higher annual production than broilers slaughtered at 56 days of age. Carcass yield was influenced by slaughter age and better breast yield was seen at 49 and 56 days than at 42 days of age. It was concluded that 3, 200 kcal ME/kg induced the best overall performance. Poultry houses were efficiently used when broilers were slaughtered at 42 days of age. Meat:bone ratio was improved for broilers slaughtered at 49 and 56 days of age...|$|R

Three hundred and twenty one cattle from three breeds (108 Bonsmara, 130 Beefmaster and 83 Brahman) were used in this study. The animals were grouped according to age categories as follows; Group 1 (16 months), Group 2 (18 months) and Group 3 (24 months). Blood samples for CK determination were collected at exsanguisation using disposable vacutainer tubes. The Muscularis longisimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL) muscle was used to determine beef colour (L,* a* and b*) and ultimate pH. Significant P (< 0. 05) breed effects were observed on bruising score and CK levels with Bonsmara breed having the highest percentage (80 percent) of bruising score and higher CK (705. 3 ± 80. 57) values. The higher CK levels were also in winter season. The effect of breed, sex and <b>age</b> at <b>slaughter</b> <b>on</b> meat quality (pHu, L*, a*, b*) was also observed.
