25|$|The duck {{has long}} been {{recognised}} as a distinct taxon, with its affinities previously considered {{to be with the}} teals. Robert Cushman Murphy was the first to demonstrate that it is <b>a</b> <b>pintail,</b> its closest relatives the yellow-billed pintails of South America (now split as the Chilean pintail A. g. spinicauda and the extinct Niceforo's pintail A. g. niceforoi), though he retained it as a full species for its isolated distribution and its 16 (rather than 14) rectrices, or tail feathers. However, the number of retrices in the ducks is variable, with many mainland pintails also having 16 retrices and a few South Georgia pintails even having 18, and the three ducks are now usually lumped as the yellow-billed pintail.|$|E

60|$|One or {{two more}} cases of fertile hybrids may be given before we pass on to the {{corresponding}} experiments in plants. Professor Alfred Newton received from a friend a pair of hybrid ducks, bred from a common duck (Anas boschas), and <b>a</b> <b>pintail</b> (Dafila acuta). From these he obtained four ducklings, but these latter, when grown up, proved infertile, and did not breed again. In this case we have the results of close interbreeding, with too great {{a difference between the}} original species, combining to produce infertility, yet the fact of a hybrid from such a pair producing healthy offspring is itself noteworthy.|$|E
5000|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae in 1758 as Anas acuta. The scientific {{name comes from}} two Latin words: anas, meaning [...] "duck", and acuta, which comes from the verb acuere, [...] "to sharpen"; the species term, like the English name, refers to the pointed tail of the male in breeding plumage. Within the large dabbling duck genus Anas, the northern pintail's closest relatives are other pintails, such as the yellow-billed <b>pintail</b> (<b>A.</b> georgica) and Eaton's <b>pintail</b> (<b>A.</b> eatoni).

6000|$|Preference for {{particular}} Males by the Females.—Having made these preliminary {{remarks on the}} discrimination and taste of birds, I will give all the facts known to me, which bear on the preference shewn by the female {{for particular}} males. It is certain that distinct species of birds occasionally pair {{in a state of}} nature and produce hybrids. Many instances could be given: thus Macgillivray relates how a male blackbird and female thrush “fell in love with each other,” and produced offspring.[163] Several years ago eighteen cases had been recorded of the occurrence in Great Britain of hybrids between the black grouse and pheasant;[164] but most of these cases may perhaps be accounted for by solitary birds not finding one of their own species to pair with. With other birds, as Mr. Jenner Weir has reason to believe, hybrids are sometimes the result of the casual intercourse of birds building in close proximity. But these remarks do not apply to the many recorded instances of tamed or domestic birds, belonging to distinct species, which have become absolutely fascinated with each other, although living with their own species. Thus Waterton[165] states that out of a flock of twenty-three Canada geese, a female paired with a solitary Bernicle gander, although so different in appearance and size; and they produced hybrid offspring. A male Wigeon (Mareca penelope), living with females of the same species, has been known to pair with <b>a</b> <b>Pintail</b> duck, Querquedula acuta. Lloyd describes the remarkable attachment between a shield-drake (Tadorna vulpanser) and a common duck. Many additional instances could be given; and the Rev. E. S. Dixon remarks that “Those who have kept many different species of geese together, well know what unaccountable attachments they are frequently forming, and that they are quite as likely to pair and rear young with individuals of a race (species) apparently the most alien to themselves, as with their own stock.” ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{evidence}} {{on this matter}} is very scanty, {{and in most cases}} not at all to the point. Some peahens preferred an old pied peacock; albino birds in a state of nature have never been seen paired with other birds; a Canada goose paired with a Bernicle gander; a male widgeon preferred <b>a</b> <b>pintail</b> duck to its own species; a hen canary preferred a male greenfinch to either linnet, goldfinch, siskin, or chaffinch. These cases are evidently exceptional, and are not such as generally occur in nature; and they only prove that the female does exert some choice between very different males, and some observations on birds in a state of nature prove the same thing; but {{there is no evidence that}} slight variations in the colour or plumes, in the way of increased intensity or complexity, are what determines the choice. On the other hand, Mr. Darwin gives much evidence that it is not so determined. He tells us that Messrs. Hewitt, Tegetmeier, and Brent, three of the highest authorities and best observers, [...] "do not believe that the females prefer certain males on account of the beauty of their plumage." [...] Mr. Hewitt was convinced [...] "that the female almost invariably prefers the most vigorous, defiant, and mettlesome male;" [...] and Mr. Tegetmeier, [...] "that a gamecock, though disfigured by being dubbed, and with his hackles trimmed, would be accepted as readily as a male retaining all his natural ornaments."[126] Evidence is adduced that a female pigeon will sometimes turn antipathy to a particular male without any assignable cause; or, in other cases, will take a strong fancy to some one bird, and will desert her own mate for him; but it is not stated that superiority or inferiority of plumage has anything to do with these fancies. Two instances are indeed given, of male birds being rejected, which had lost their ornamental plumage; but in both cases (a widow-finch and a silver pheasant) the long tail-plumes are the indication of sexual maturity. Such cases do not support the idea that males with the tail-feathers a trifle longer, or the colours a trifle brighter, are generally preferred, and that those which are only a little inferior are as generally rejected,--and this is what is absolutely needed to establish the theory of the development of these plumes by means of the choice of the female.|$|E

Methods The following features were compared between saddled and unsaddled individuals: body mass change of wild Teal between ringing and first live recovery, pairing probability of wild Teal through the winter, wild Teal and Wigeon time-budgets, captive Mallard and Pintail body mass fluctuations, testosterone levels and dominance in the aviary. Results We generally found {{no significant difference between}} values for birds with nasal saddles and control birds. Exceptions were for pairing probability, which was lower for marked Teal during one of the winters, and the proportion of aggressive interactions won by Pintail, which decreased after they were fitted with saddles, while this did not happen in Mallard. Conclusions Nasal saddles are an appropriate general method for marking dabbling ducks. However, saddles may not be appropriate for the study of social relationships in some conditions...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTo {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} competition and predation on foraging by wintering granivorous dabbling ducks, we collected data on long-term changes in forag- ing methods used during winter in the marshes of western France. Teal Anas crecca, mallard <b>A.</b> platyrhynchos and <b>pintail</b> <b>A.</b> acuta start feeding in shallow areas, and later switch to deeper feeding methods. We show experimentally that the food intake rate is 1. 5 times higher in shallow (5 cm) than in deep (35 cm) areas, {{which may explain why}} shallow feeding is the principal method used early in the winter season. In the field, the switch between foraging methods was neither related to the frequency of fly-overs by raptors nor to the density of competitors at a foraging site, although birds foraged deeper sooner at sites frequented more often. Thus, the potential role of interference competition remained unclear. Conversely, at each site, the proportion of deep foragers in- creased with increasing cumulative numbers of foragers, used as a measure of food depletion. We therefore have no evidence that disturbance by predators has an important effect on the foraging methods used, whereas competition through food depletion may play a major role...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Wildlife Management, 1997 In general, {{waterfowl}} incubation periods {{have been}} reported as single values. However, there are {{a growing number of}} studies which suggest that variable incubation periods within a species may be the norm for waterfowl, and that this variation may be correlated with other life-history factors. In this study, I examined variation in length of incubation, clutch size, and nest initiation date for 297 nests of Blue-winged Teal (Anas discors), Mallards (A. platyrhynchos), Gadwalls (<b>A.</b> strepera), Northern <b>Pintails</b> (<b>A.</b> acuta), and Northern Shovelers (A. clypeata) in northeastern North Dakota during 1995 and 1996. In addition, I conducted a manipulative experiment to directly assess the relationship between clutch size and incubation period in Blue-winged Teal. Incubation periods were highly variable and were negatively correlated with nest initiation date for all species and in all years. After controlling for nest initiation date, incubation periods were unaffected by clutch size except during one of two years in Mallards. When Blue-winged Teal clutch sizes were manipulated, enlarged clutches had significantly longer incubation periods than control or reduced clutches, but reduced and control clutches had similar incubation lengths. Clutch size manipulation data supported the hypothesis that the cost of incubation increases with clutch size, and that incubation may work with other factors to help limit clutch size. These results suggest that variation in incubation periods may be an important life-history component of dabbling ducks...|$|R

60|$|Not {{only does}} the female exert a choice, but in some few cases she courts the male, or even fights for his possession. Sir R. Heron states that with peafowl, the first {{advances}} are always made by the female; something {{of the same kind}} takes place, according to Audubon, with the older females of the wild turkey. With the capercailzie, the females flit round the male, whilst he is parading at one of the places of assemblage, and solicit his attention.[175] We have seen that a tame wild-duck seduced after a long courtship <b>an</b> unwilling <b>Pintail</b> drake. Mr. Bartlett believes that the Lophophorus, like many other gallinaceous birds, is naturally polygamous, but two females cannot be placed in the same cage with a male, as they fight so much together. The following instance of rivalry is more surprising as it relates to bullfinches, which usually pair for life. Mr. Jenner Weir introduced a dull-coloured and ugly female into his aviary, and she immediately attacked another mated female so unmercifully that the latter had to be separated. The new female did all the courtship, and was at last successful, for she paired with the male; but after a time she met with a just retribution, for, ceasing to be pugnacious, Mr. Weir replaced the old female, and the male then deserted his new and returned to his old love.|$|R
40|$|Current {{ecological}} theory {{states that}} food and danger considerations underlie patch selection. Foraging {{sites for the}} 100, 000 ducks wintering on the Fraser River delta, British Columbia, Canada, are embedded in a matrix of suburban and rural land use types. I investigated foraging by American wigeon (Anas Americana), mallard (<b>A.</b> platyrhynchos), northern <b>pintail</b> (<b>A.</b> acuta) and green-winged teal (A. carolinensis) {{to test the hypothesis}} that features adjacent to foraging sites such as buildings or roads cast a 2 ̆ 7 shadow of danger 2 ̆ 7 that reduces patch use and thus habitat carrying capacity. I measured patch use with winter-long dropping counts on transects across fields adjacent to residential areas, greenhouses, roads and berry fields. Usage was highest adjacent to greenhouses, lowest adjacent to residential areas, and intermediate adjacent to berry fields and roads. Seasonal usage of a field was steady once begun, began soonest adjacent to greenhouses, and latest adjacent to residential areas. The distribution pattern of droppings across fields showed that ducks avoided residential areas, and foraged close to greenhouses. They showed no strong distribution pattern at berry fields and roads. The measured level of activity (wildlife, people, traffic, noises, lights, etc.) was highest at residential areas and roads, and lowest at greenhouses. Patch use and seasonal usage was lower in fields bordering land uses with higher activity levels. Previous studies on wintering ducks on the Fraser River delta widely report that upland foraging is largely nocturnal, that diurnal use is restricted to roosting on flooded fields, and that crop type strongly influences field usage. In contrast, I found that nocturnal and diurnal foraging were similar, though fields were visited more often at night. Landscape-scale selection of fields was best explained (AIC) by models including field-level measures of danger and greenhouse proximity: neither available energy nor standing water were included in the most informative models. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that danger from various land use types strongly influences the foraging distribution of wintering ducks...|$|R
