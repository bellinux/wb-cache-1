40|$|Measures of {{adolescent}} <b>appearance</b> distress {{have focused on}} weight and body shape, excluding other aspects of <b>appearance.</b> The absence of a psychometrically sound, general measure of <b>appearance</b> distress has limited evaluation of interventions and curtailed investigation of psychological processes in adolescent <b>appearance</b> adjustment. This paper describes the development of scales assessing adolescent <b>appearance</b> distress to address this dearth of appropriate measures, validated through cross-sectional design involving 617 adolescents. Two scales were developed, comprising 13 items for younger adolescents and 17 items for older adolescents.

The aims of this five-wave (2. 5 -year), multiple-informant longitudinal study were to (a) examine growth trajectories of <b>appearance</b> anxiety symptoms and <b>appearance</b> esteem, (b) identify whether trajectories differed by gender, and (c) examine several launching factors including parent-reported physical maturation, peer-rated physical <b>appearance,</b> body mass index, and <b>appearance</b> teasing {{by parents and}} peers. Participants were 387 adolescents (44 % boys) aged 10 to 13 years at the first assessment. Steep growth in <b>appearance</b> anxiety symptoms was found for both girls and boys, {{but there was no}} average change in <b>appearance</b> esteem. Girls had more elevated <b>appearance</b> anxiety symptoms and lower <b>appearance</b> esteem than boys, girls’ body mass index was associated with symptoms, and earlier physical maturation and teasing about <b>appearance,</b> alone and in combination, were associated with growth in <b>appearance</b> anxiety symptoms for girls and boys. Earlier maturing boys who were highly teased by parents, but even more so when teased by peers, were at utmost risk for elevated <b>appearance</b> anxiety symptoms and increasing symptoms over time. In contrast, all girls exhibited elevated or increasing <b>appearance</b> anxiety symptoms across time, with the exception of girls with the latest maturation who also reported little teasing about their <b>appearance.</b> Griffith Health, School of Applied PsychologyNo Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|The current chapter {{presents}} a review on {{the portrayal of}} <b>appearance</b> ideals in popular entertainment media. Literature on {{the components of the}} ideal <b>appearance</b> in popular media and the nature of portrayals of <b>appearance</b> standards in popular media is examined. First, study findings on the characteristics of <b>appearance</b> ideals presented in the media demonstrate that popular media frequently glamorize curvaceously thin female and mesomorphic male characters with flawless faces and a suntanned White or lighter Black skin tone. Second, younger characters are more likely to adhere to <b>appearance</b> standards in media content than older characters. Moreover, the ideal <b>appearance</b> is considered to be malleable. Characters with an ideal <b>appearance</b> also outperform characters deviating from <b>appearance</b> standards at a sexual, social and professional level. Lastly, <b>appearance</b> standards in the media are inherently related to stereotypes on gender and ethnicity. Several recommendations for future research are provided. status: accepte...|$|R
