5|$|Many of Coffin's {{theories}} and principles {{can be seen}} in practice in her most famous creation, Harry and Ruth du Pont's gardens at their Winterthur estate. Her work on the gardens began in 1929 and became the biggest commission of her career. It was very fortuitously timed for her, as the Wall Street Crash of 1929 wiped out the fortunes of many of her clients and brought to an end the era of commissioning elaborate gardens for large country estates. Coffin had somewhat better luck with her investments <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> fortune of the du Ponts insulated the family from the worst of the Great Depression, permitting work on Winterthur to continue throughout the downturn. With the money from her investments and the fees from the du Ponts for the Winterthur commission, Coffin was able to maintain two homes, a maid and a chauffeur despite the general economic decline.|$|E

Accustomed to a warmer Corsican climate, the morale of the men only decreased.

25|$|There may be {{locations}} in the Sea of Okhotsk where right whales can reliably be found in summer. In the Sea of Okhotsk, the right whales are currently distributed far from shore {{in the southern part}} of the sea. The Sea is mainly Russian territorial waters, so Russian cooperation is required for any surveys. The remoteness of the location <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> demand for ships and aircraft associated with oil and gas exploration near Sakhalin Island, make any ship or aerial surveys difficult and expensive.|$|E

25|$|In 1501, the Portuguese {{navigator}} Afonso de Albuquerque sighted {{the island}} on Ascension Day (which fell on 21 May that year) and named it Ilha da Ascensão after this feast day. Dry and barren, the island had little appeal for passing ships except for collecting fresh meat, {{and was not}} claimed for the Portuguese Crown.

25|$|Although {{there is}} little ethnic strife in Paraguay to impede social and {{economic}} progress, there is social conflict caused by underemployment <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> economic inequality {{between the rich and}} the poor, who are mostly rural inhabitants. Positive steps to correct these inequities have occurred since the 1989 ousting of Stroessner, and the occupation by the poor {{of hundreds of thousands of}} acres of land, which they claimed for subsistence farming. The country's political system is moving toward a fully functioning democracy. However, the tradition of political hierarchical organizational structures and generous rewarding of political favors prevails.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 15th century a {{competition}} {{was held in}} Florence for a plan to roof the central crossing of the huge, unfinished Gothic Cathedral. It was won by the artist Brunelleschi who, inspired by domes {{that he had seen}} on his travels, such as that of San Vitale in Ravenna <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> dome of the Roman period which roofed the Pantheon, designed a huge dome which is regarded as the first building of the Renaissance period. Its style, visually however, is ribbed and pointed and purely Gothic. It was Renaissance (a rebirth) in its audacity {{and the fact that it}} looked back to Roman structural techniques.|$|E
25|$|Determined to {{keep the}} labor sector under control, Barrientos took away most of the gains it had {{achieved}} during the MNR's rule. He placed Comibol {{under the control of}} a military director and abolished the veto power of union leaders in management decisions. The president also cut the pay of the miners to the equivalent of US$0.80 a day and reduced the mining work force <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> Comibol bureaucracy by 10%. Finally, he destroyed the Bolivian Labor Federation (Central Obrera Boliviana, COB) and the mine workers' union, suppressed all strike activity, disarmed the miners' militias, and exiled union leaders. Military troops again occupied the mines, and in 1967 they massacred miners and their families at the Catavi-Siglo XX mines.|$|E

25|$|The lake has had {{a history}} of water level changes. Originally, it was {{essentially}} two lakes connected via a broad channel flowing through a marshy area along the north end. Prior to the dam and flooding much of area was forest and swamp land. The lake was flooded approximately ten feet when William Purdy and his sons dammed the Scugog River at Lindsay (Upstream from the current dam and locks) in 1834 to power his grist mill. During this period of high water levels through the mid-thirties, today's so-called islands of Washburn, Nonquon (now Seven Mile), Ball, Platten, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> centrally located Scugog came into existence as islands. Today, these form part of the mainland, with the exception of Scugog Island, which is generally maintained as an island by man-made channels around the swampy south end of the island.|$|E
25|$|After {{the conquest}} of the city, in 1462 Sultan Mehmet II (r. 1444–1446; 1451–1481) {{fortified}} the harbour, now known as Kadırga Limanı ("Harbour of the Galleys"), building several towers. However, {{the beginning of the}} construction in 1515 of a new arsenal on the Golden Horn, the Tersâne-i Âmire, protected from the storms provoked by the southwest wind, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> growth of the Ottoman navy, caused the decay of the Kadırga Limanı. The 16th-century French traveller Pierre Gilles reports that around 1540 the women living in that neighbourhood used to wash their clothes in the basin. However, in some 18th-century maps, the harbour is still shown in active use. The end of the port was accelerated by the erection of the Nuruosmaniye Mosque, started in 1748, since the excavated earth was partly thrown in the harbour. The basin and the arsenal have since long time disappeared, and today they are partly built up.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of the second meeting it was obvious that the second plan was the only {{possible}} recourse, since any phased withdrawal along Highway 1 had become impossible.

Trưởng then requested permission for a withdrawal of his forces into the three enclaves as planned and for the retention of the Marines.

500|$|The Greco-Persian Wars (also {{often called}} the Persian Wars) were a series of {{conflicts}} between the [...] Achaemenid Empire of Persia and Greek city-states that started in 499 BC and lasted until 449 BC. The collision between the fractious political world of the Greeks <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> empire of the Persians began when Cyrus the Great conquered the Greek-inhabited region of Ionia in 547 BC. Struggling to rule the independent-minded cities of Ionia, the Persians appointed tyrants to rule each of them.

500|$|After the Swedish loss at {{the battle}} of Fehrbellin in June 1675, the fleet was to support troop {{transports}} to reinforce Swedish Pomerania.

Altogether there were 28 large and medium warships and almost the same number of smaller vessels. The supply organization was lacking. There were few experienced high-ranking officers and internal cooperation was poor; Danish contemporaries scornfully described the Swedish Navy crews as mere [...] "farmhands dipped in saltwater".|$|E
500|$|Complementing Kaufmann and True's work, the Norwegian-born, {{naturalized}} American sculptor Oskar J.W. Hansen designed many of {{the sculptures}} on and around the dam. His works include the monument of dedication plaza, a plaque to memorialize the workers killed and the bas-reliefs on the elevator towers. In his words, Hansen wanted his work to express [...] "the immutable calm of intellectual resolution, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> power of trained physical strength, equally enthroned in placid triumph of scientific accomplishment", because [...] "he building of Hoover Dam belongs to the sagas of the daring."

500|$|Experiences in the Russo-Japanese War {{convinced}} naval war planners {{that more}} fast capital ships were needed, so on 4 April 1907, the Imperial Defence Council approved an [...] "Eight-eight" [...] policy.

500|$|Biofuel {{development}} and use is a complex issue {{because there are many}} biofuel options which are available.
