25|$|Flushed with victory, {{the knight}} kneels and renders thanks to heaven. Seeing the moon, {{he takes it}} for his Dulcinea and tries to get to her. As he {{approaches}} the windmills {{he can see the}} moon no longer and thinks that evil magicians have hidden his beloved mistress. So, spear in hand, he tilts at the wings of the windmill, which he mistakes for a giant. Alas, the knight is caught by one of the wings <b>and</b> <b>flung</b> into the air. He falls unconscious at Sancho's feet.|$|E
25|$|Thus, in 1345, {{hearing of}} the Pope's reversal, a group of noble conspirators (probably {{including}} Queen Joan) determined to forestall Andrew's coronation. During a hunting trip at Aversa, Andrew left his room {{in the middle of}} the night and was set upon by the conspirators. A treacherous servant barred the door behind him; and as Joan cowered in their bed, a terrible struggle ensued, Andrew defending himself furiously and shrieking for aid. He was finally overpowered, strangled with a cord, <b>and</b> <b>flung</b> from a window. The horrible deed would taint the rest of Joan's reign.|$|E
25|$|Several initial assaults failed {{until the}} Doge had the ships tied into pairs, thus {{doubling}} their momentum as the sailed against the fortifications. As the Venetians seized two towers, the Frankish Crusaders took a gate {{and opened it}} to their comrades. Alexios V tried to rally a counter-attack but when this failed, he fled to Thrace with his mistress Eudokia Angelina and her mother Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera. There Alexios V and Eudokia were married, solidifying hie relation to the Angeloi. He was later captured by the Crusaders in 1205 <b>and</b> <b>flung</b> to death.|$|E

25|$|The H.F. Bailey crossed Leman Bank {{and reached}} the Mount Ida around 1230 hrs. By this time the ship's {{starboard}} lifeboat had been carried away, she was listing heavily to starboard and lying head on to the seas, and her position offered no lee for the lifeboat to come alongside. The H.F. Bailey made an attempt to throw a line to the stricken vessel but was twice struck by the heavy seas <b>and</b> <b>flung</b> back. Coxswain Blogg made another attempt to come alongside, before deciding {{that it was too}} dangerous and {{that he would have to}} wait for the sea to slacken.|$|E
25|$|On Thursday the 9 September 1937 the Nimbin and {{the small}} tug Teven {{collided}} on the Richmond river near Coraki and Joseph Smith, 72, the engine driver of the tug Teven was killed, and Charles Young, a seaman on the Teven, was seriously injured. The Teven was towing a timber barge when the collision occurred, Young, who was steering, was hurled on to the barge, suffering severe Injuries to the back. Smith, {{who was in charge}} of the engine, was crushed <b>and</b> <b>flung</b> into the water. His leg was smashed practically to pulp, and he was dead when picked up.|$|E
25|$|According to folklore, notably {{celebrated by}} a statue {{in front of}} the town hall, the city got its name from a legend about a giant called Antigoon who lived near the Scheldt river. He exacted a toll from passing boatmen, and for those who refused, he severed one of their hands and threw it into the river. Eventually the giant was killed by a young hero named Silvius Brabo, who cut off the giant's own hand <b>and</b> <b>flung</b> it into the river. Hence the name Antwerpen, from Dutch hand werpen, akin to Old English hand and wearpan (to throw), which has evolved to today's warp.|$|E

25|$|In May 1568 Mary, Queen of Scots fled to England, <b>and</b> <b>flung</b> {{herself on}} Elizabeth's protection. She had found refuge in Carlisle Castle, and the {{delicate}} duty of {{taking charge of}} the fugitive was entrusted jointly to Knollys and to Henry Scrope, 9th Baron Scrope of Bolton. On 28 May Knollys arrived at the castle, and was admitted to Mary's presence. At his first interview he was conscious of Mary's powerful fascination. But to her {{requests for an interview}} with Elizabeth, and for help to regain her throne, he returned the evasive answers which Elizabeth's advisers had suggested to him, and he frankly drew her attention to the suspicions in which Darnley's murder involved her.|$|E
25|$|The First World War {{introduced}} killing {{on such a}} {{mass scale}} that few nations were prepared to cope with it. Millions of bodies were never recovered, or were recovered long after any identification could be made. Hundreds of thousands of bodies were buried on the battlefield where they lay. It was often impossible to dig trenches without unearthing remains, and artillery barrages often uncovered bodies <b>and</b> <b>flung</b> the disintegrating corpses into the air. Many bodies were buried in French municipal cemeteries, but these rapidly filled to capacity. Due to the costs and sheer number of remains involved, Australia, Canada, India, Newfoundland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom barred repatriation of remains.|$|E
25|$|EF4 (T8-T9) damage {{typically}} {{results in}} a total loss of the affected structure. Well-built homes are reduced to a short pile of medium-sized debris on the foundation. Homes with poor or no anchoring will be swept completely away. Large, heavy vehicles, including airplanes, trains, and large trucks, can be pushed over, flipped repeatedly or picked up and thrown. Large, healthy trees are entirely debarked and snapped off {{close to the ground}} or uprooted altogether and turned into flying projectiles. Passenger cars and similarly sized objects can be picked up <b>and</b> <b>flung</b> for considerable distances. EF4 damage can be expected to level even the most robustly built homes, making the common practice of sheltering in an interior room {{on the ground floor of}} a residence insufficient to ensure survival. A storm shelter, reinforced basement or other subterranean shelter is considered necessary to provide any reasonable expectation of safety against EF4 damage.|$|E

25|$|The ongoing {{stalemate}} of the Battles of the Isonzo drew {{more and}} more of Italy's military forces northward to repel the invaders. By August 1917, the Italians could muster over 200 operational aircraft on its northern front on any given day. Their pressure on the invaders was considerable. In the early hours of 24 October 1917, the Austro-Hungarians having been supplemented by German troops, launched a devastating attack on the Italian lines centered on the Caporetto Valley. Shattered by the first use of poison gas on the Italian front <b>and</b> <b>flung</b> back by the ferocious assaults, Italian troops withdrew to the Piave River to establish a new defense line. Italian fighter aircraft flew several daily sorties apiece in support of their own troops during this battle. Demand for close air support was so insistent that the massive Caproni strategic bombers were diverted to the task. Naval seaplanes were even called in overland in support missions.|$|E
25|$|He {{began his}} 2000 {{season with a}} {{personal}} best run in the half marathon of 1:01:50 hours, with which he won the Kyoto Half Marathon. He came fourth at the 2000 Boston Marathon, recording a time of 2:10:29 hours on the Massachusetts course. He was later chosen for the Kenyan marathon team for the 2000 Sydney Olympics, gaining the chance to represent his country at the Olympic level for the first time. However, while driving his family in Kenya that July, he {{was a victim of}} a violent carjacking. His pregnant wife was pushed from the car, then Osoro was shot by a gunman in the neck <b>and</b> <b>flung</b> from the vehicle. The carjackers later released Osoro's daughter and sister-in-law unharmed and abandoned the car. Osoro was hospitalised for eight weeks and visited neurologists in London – nerve damage had left him temporarily unable to move his arm and leg {{on the right side of}} his body. He missed his chance at run at the Olympics and was only able to begin running again in April 2001.|$|E
25|$|According to Wilferd Madelung, after Abu Bakr's {{election}} {{he and a}} {{few other}} companions went to Fatimah's house to receive homage from Ali and his supporters gathered there. When Umar threatened to set the house ablaze unless they came out, Zubayr came out with his sword drawn. He lost his sword, and Umar's men carried him off. Evidence exists that Fatimah's house was searched, and Ali reportedly said that if he had been forty men he would have resisted. Abu Bakr isolated the Banu Hashim (who, according to Al-Zuhri, refused to swear allegiance) for six months. According to Lesley Hazleton, Umar decided to break into Fatima's house instead of burning it <b>and</b> <b>flung</b> himself at the door. Twelver Shi'ite sources relate that Umar set fire to Fatimah's door before kicking it open, crushing Fatimah (who was trying to hold the door shut). The blow killed Mohsin, Fatimah's unborn son, broke her ribs and later caused her death). This is disputed by Sunni Muslims, who believe that no such conflict ever occurred. Twelvers believe that Ali, under orders from Muhammad not to fight back, was put in chains; when Abu Bakr's selection to the caliphate was a fait accompli, Ali withheld his allegiance until after Fatimah's death because {{he did not want to}} cause strife in the nascent Muslim community. He buried Fatimah at night, with none of Abu Bakr's supporters present, and the location of her grave is uncertain.|$|E

25|$|In 1821, Greek nationalists in the Romanian Principalities {{and in the}} Peloponnese and the Aegean islands, {{launched}} a series of uprisings against the Ottoman Empire, aiming to liberate ethnic Greeks from three centuries of Ottoman rule (see Greek War of Independence). The Ottoman government responded with a determined effort to defeat the rebellion. For the Ottoman government, Greece was a core province. Its loss could not be contemplated, unlike other regions such as the Romanian Principalities and Serbia, which were considered peripheral vassal-states. The fear of the Ottoman Sultan, Mahmud II (ruled 1808–39), was that the secession of even {{a small part of}} Greece such as the Peloponnese would lead to demands by Greek nationalists for the liberation of all the other regions of the empire containing Greek majorities, including central Greece, Macedonia, Thrace, Constantinople itself, western Anatolia, the Aegean islands and Crete, threatening the empire's very existence. In addition, the Greeks were economically critical, as they dominated the empire's trade through their ownership of much of its merchant shipping. On a personal level, Mahmud considered the Greek revolt a monstrous betrayal by a conquered nation that had always been treated generously by the Porte. The Sultan vented his fury on the ethnarch and spiritual leader of the Greeks, the Orthodox Patriarch of Constantinople, Gregory V, whom he suspected of colluding with the rebels. As the Patriarch emerged from his cathedral, in full regalia, after celebrating Easter Mass in April 1821, he was seized by Janissaries and hanged on the spot, from the cathedral gates. After being left to dangle in public for three days, his corpse was dragged through the streets <b>and</b> <b>flung</b> into the Bosporus.|$|E
500|$|On 5 May {{the worst}} of the weather returned, and brought them close to {{disaster}} in the largest seas so far. Shackleton later wrote: [...] "We felt our boat lifted <b>and</b> <b>flung</b> forward like a cork in breaking surf". The crew bailed frantically to keep afloat. Nevertheless, they were still moving towards their goal, and a dead reckoning calculation by Worsley on the next day, 6 May, suggested that they were now [...] from the western point of South Georgia. The strains of the past two weeks were by now taking their toll on the men. Shackleton observed that Vincent had collapsed and ceased to be {{an active member of the}} crew, McCarthy was [...] "weak, but happy", McNish was weakening but still showing [...] "grit and spirit".|$|E
500|$|Aircraft from USN Task Force 38 {{attacked}} the ship on 24 July {{as part of}} a major raid on Kure and the Inland Sea, but she was only hit once. A [...] bomb struck one of the ship's anti-aircraft mounts on the port side. Thirteen men were killed and five wounded, but the bomb did little other damage. A second raid on 28 July did far more damage to the ship as a [...] bomb penetrated the flight deck and detonated in the upper hangar, between the elevators. The explosion blew out a [...] section of the port hangar wall and the walls of the upper hangar deck were bulged and perforated multiple times. The flight deck between the elevators was bulged up and buckled; one section of the flight deck out was blown out <b>and</b> <b>flung</b> over to starboard to land across the funnels. Only 13 men were killed (including her executive officer) and another 12 men were wounded during the attack.|$|E

[...] During one of her visits to the city she was subjected to one of the less happy events to befall this magnificent ship.
