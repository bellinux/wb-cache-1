40|$|BACKGROUND: Vulvar {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (SCC) originates the following two pathways, related to differentiated (d) vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) or to human papillomavirus (HPV) -related usual (u) VIN. Multicentric HPV infections (cervix, vagina and vulva) are common. We hypothesise that patients with a uVIN-related vulvar SCC more often have cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) compared with women with dVIN-related vulvar SCC. METHODS: All vulvar SCCs (201) were classified to be dVIN- (n= 164) or uVIN related (n= 37). Data {{with regard to the}} smear history and cervical histology were retrieved from PALGA, the nationwide Netherlands database of histo- and cytopathology. For HSIL cervical smears of which histology was taken, HPV DNA analysis on both the vulvar and cervical specimens was performed. RESULTS: At least one smear was available in 145 (72 %) of the 201 patients. Patients with a uVIN-related vulvar SCC more often had an HSIL compared with patients with a dVIN-related SCC (35 vs 2 %, P< 0. 001). A total of 10 of the 13 HSILs were histologically assessed and identical HPV types were found in the vulva and cervix. CONCLUSION: These data emphasise the necessity to differentiate between dVIN- and uVIN-related vulvar tumours and to examine the entire lower female <b>ano-genital</b> <b>tract</b> once an uVIN-related lesion is found...|$|E
40|$|People with HIV/AIDS (PWHA) have {{increased}} risk of some cancers. The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) has improved their life expectancy, exposing them to the combined consequences of aging and of a prolonged exposure to cancer risk factors. The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate incidence rates (IR) in PWHA in Italy, before and after the introduction of HAART, after adjusting for sex and age through direct standardization. An anonymous record linkage between Italian AIDS Registry (21, 951 cases) and Cancer Registries (17. 3 million, 30 % of Italian population) was performed. In PWHA, crude IR, sex- and age-standardized IR and age-specific IR were estimated. The standardized IR for Kaposi sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma greatly declined in the HAART period. Although the crude IR for all non-AIDS-defining cancers increased in the HAART period, standardized IR did not significantly differ in the 2 periods (352 and 379 / 100, 000, respectively). Increases were seen only for cancer of the liver (IR ratio = 4. 6, 95 % CI: 1. 3 – 17. 0) and lung (IR ratio = 1. 8, 95 % CI: 1. 0 – 3. 2). Age-specific IRs for liver and lung cancers, however, largely overlapped in the 2 periods pointing to the strong influence of the shift in the age distribution of PWHA on the observed upward trends. In conclusion, standardized IRs for non-AIDS-defining cancers have not risen in the HAART period, even if crude IRs of these cancers increased. This scenario calls, however, for the intensification of cancer-prevention strategies, notably smoking cessation and screening programs, in middle-aged HIV-patients. Individuals who are infected with HIV have an {{increased risk of}} cancer. 1 – 3 Since 1982, Kaposi sarcoma (KS), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and—since 1993 —invasive cervical cancer have been part of the clinical definition of AIDS. 4 Evidence of a cancer excess among people with HIV/AIDS (PWHA) compared to the general population has accumulated over the years for several other cancers, in particular Hodgkin lymphoma, cancers of the <b>ano-genital</b> <b>tract,</b> liver and lung. 1 – 3 HIV infection leads, through immune dysregulation, to increased replication or persistence of oncogenic viruses (in particular, Epstein Barr virus, KS-herpesvirus and human papillomaviruses). 5 Moreover, PWHA have higher prevalence of oncogenic virus infection, compared to the general population. Although the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) in 1996 has greatly lowered the risk of KS and NHL in PWHA, 6, 7 other cancers have not shown equally favorable trends. 8 – 11 In addition, improved survival started exposing PWHA to the combined consequences of aging and of the prolonged exposure to cancer risk factors such as oncogenic virus infections and tobacco smoking. Only a few studies reported population-based estimates of age-adjusted incidence rates (IR) of cancers other than KS and NHL among PWHA. 12, 13 This study intends to contribute to the current knowledge showing an update of cancer incidence in a population-based study from a country severely hit by AIDS and where women and injecting-drug users are proportionally more common among AIDS patients than in most other developed countries. A record linkage between the National AIDS Registry and all Italian population-based cancer registries was carried out with the aim to estimate changes in cancer IRs in PWHA in Italy before and after the introduction of HAART, after adjusting for age with direct standardization. On account of the substantial aging of PWHA after HAART availability, special attention was paid to standardize IRs by sex and age and to compare age-specific IRs. AIDS: acquired immunodeficiency syndrome; CI: confidence interval; HAART: highly active antiretroviral therapies; HBV: Hepatitis B virus; HCV: Hepatitis C virus; HIV: human immunodeficiency virus; IR: incidence rates; KS: Kaposi sarcoma; NADC: non-AIDS-defining cancer; NHL: non-Hodgkin lymphoma; PWHA: people with HIV/AIDS; PY: person-year...|$|E
40|$|Management of perineal wounds {{can be very}} {{frustrating}} as these invariably get contaminated from the <b>ano-genital</b> <b>tracts.</b> Moreover, the apparent skin defect {{may be associated with}} a significant three dimensional dead space in the pelvic region. Such wounds are likely to become chronic and recalcitrant if appropriate wound management is not instituted in a timely manner. These wounds usually result after tumor excision, following trauma or as a result of infective pathologies like hideradenitis suppurativa or following thermal burns. Many options are available for management of perineal wounds and these have been discussed with illustrative case examples. A review of literature has been done for listing commonly instituted options for management of the wounds in perineum...|$|R
40|$|The adoptive {{transfer}} of cancer Ag-specific effector T cells in patients {{can result in}} tumor rejection, thereby illustrating the immune system potential for cancer therapy. Viruses involved in tumorigenesis are useful targets because viral proteins are not expressed in normal cells and their expression is required to maintain the malignant phenotype. Between oncoviruses, high risk human papillomavirus (HPV) has a well-characterized transforming propriety {{and it has been}} associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the <b>ano-genital</b> and oral <b>tracts.</b> Cutaneous genotypes are, instead, associated with some forms of non-melanoma skin cancer. Transforming ability of HPV is based on the function of E 6 and E 7 viral oncoproteins, which interact and inactivate pRB and p 53 oncosuppressors, respectively. For these reasons vaccines targeting oncogenic E 6 and E 7 are ideal candidates to elicit strong immune responses without generating autoimmunity. Here we report results obtained using a protocol based on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDC) and/or langerhans cells (MDLC) incubated in vitro with necrotic keratinocytes expressing both E 6 and E 7 oncoproteins derived from mucosal (HPV 16) or cutaneous (HPV 38) genotypes. We observed the capability of MDDCs i) to uptake necrotic material from transformed keratinocytes; ii) to upregulate the expression of class I HLA and CD 86 co-stimulatory molecule following uptake and iii) to specifically prime in vitro cytotoxic T lymphocytes against E 6 /E 7 -expressing keratinocytes. We also provide preliminary evidences indicating the ability of necrotic keratinocytes to alter the microRNA profile in immature MDLC compared to prototipical stimuli as bacterial lipopolisaccharyde...|$|R

40|$|The {{inception}} of tumor microenvironment (TME), {{a complex and}} dynamic system constituted by different types of cells engaged by tumor and extracellular matrix surrounding cancer cells, {{is a way for}} them to elude the immune surveillance. Dendritic cells (DCs), as a sentinel, are able to recognize alteration in the microenvironment and predispose the immune system response. The relationship between cancer and virus infection is well documented. High-risk Human Papillomavirus (HR-HPV) has a well-characterized transforming property and has been associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the <b>ano-genital</b> and oral <b>tracts.</b> Transforming ability of HR-HPVs is based on the function of E 6 and E 7 viral oncoproteins, which interact and inactivate p 53 and pRb oncosuppressors, respectively. Recently, it was demonstrated that HPV oncoproteins are also able to affect a number of microRNAs (miRNAs) regulating the expression of genes involved in proliferative control. For these reasons DC-based vaccines targeting oncogenic E 6 and E 7 are ideal candidates to elicit strong immune responses. Here we summarize significant data about the analysis of TME in HPV-induced tumorigenesis. We also report original results produced by cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) in vitro priming against E 6 and E 7 HPV 16 antigens, performed using human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Dendritic cells, maturated by the exposition to necrotic or apoptotic keratinocytes expressing both oncoproteins of HPV 16, show different expression levels of specific maturation markers. Evidence indicating the ability of necrotic keratinocytes to alter the microRNA profile in DCs, macrophages (MΦ) and Langerhans cells (LCs) compared to prototypical stimuli as bacterial lipopolysaccharide was also provided. We can speculate that, based on transformed cells death pathway (i. e. apoptosis versus necrosis), virus-induced immune alterations might show different results in creating an immunotolerogenic microenvironment during the carcinogenesis process...|$|R
