2500|$|Cosmopolitan Building (1895) - This three-story stone neo-Classical revival {{building}} {{topped by}} three small domes {{was designed by}} Stanford White as the headquarters for Cosmopolitan when the magazine moved from New York to Irvington. John Brisben Walker, who had bought the general interest magazine in 1889, had a mansion in Irvington only a short walk away. In 1897 Walker started a free correspondence school, the Cosmopolitan Educational University Extension. When 20,000 people enrolled, Walker was unable to keep to its offer of a no-cost education for all, and had to <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> to pay $20 per year. Nevertheless, the venture attracted well-known academics to its staff, and public lectures and other events associated with the school were held in the headquarters building. The magazine also sponsored several automobile races from New York to Irvington to promote the automobile. Cosmopolitan left Irvington shortly after William Randolph Hearst bought the magazine in 1905 and moved it back to New York. Afterwards, the building {{was used as a}} silent movie studio for some period of time, but for most of its subsequent history has primarily housed manufacturing concerns of various types, including one that made radio oscillators used by the U.S. Army in World War II, and a company that made looseleaf binders and other paper products.The Cosmopolitan Building still stands, although it is known as the [...] "Trent Building" [...] after the family that owns it, but it is quite run down, and its visage has suffered from the pedestrian brick industrial building which was stuck onto its rear, obscuring the eastern facade. The building houses manufacturers, offices, a video production facility, a publisher of art books, interior design firms, a yoga studio, a chapel, photographers, a spa, a florist and event space and at least one restaurant.

40|$|The study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the following problems: (1) what are the techniques used by teacher in teaching speaking for the third grade of the language program class of SMA Negeri 1 Kepanjen?, (2) How does the teacher apply the technique in teaching speaking for the third grade language program class of SMA Negeri 1 Kepanjen. A descriptive qualitative research design {{was used in this}} study, and the data were collected through three times of non participant observation and once an interview method. The steps of collecting data included preliminary visit, contacting the headmaster, contacting the English teacher, giving some interview, and conducting classroom observation. The results of this study were six techniques found from observation and interview. There was discussion carried out by <b>asking</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> to make a debate in pro and contra aspect; storytelling was carried out by <b>asking</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> to tell their story one by one in front of the class; interviews was carried out by <b>asking</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> to play a role as interviewers and interviewees using Yes/No Question and W/H Question; describing picture was carried out by <b>asking</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> to describe <b>the</b> pictures and to give comment about the picture; communication game was carried out by <b>asking</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> to make a guessing game with particular topic provided; and prepared talk was carried out by <b>asking</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> to make a presentation by using media such as a projector and laptop as well as image and video. In the concluding chapter, it was noted that the study reported in this thesis has shortcomings.

Students should also continue to make predictions at a few points in the story as well. It is important not to ask too many questions while reading the story. To help students to focus attention on the story, it is better to wait until after reading it through once to ask most of the questions about the students’ reactions, comments, and questions.|$|E
5000|$|In the 'K' column, {{the teacher}} has {{to make sure that}} she or he has all the {{questions}} ready for the students to brainstorm on the particular idea that needs to be taken care in that class. The questions help the students to be prompted to think in specific directions that will lead them to the first step of brainstorming. Also <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> the reason of their answers. By this the teacher makes them aware of their associations to the answers. The questions like [...] " [...] what made you think like that?" [...] shall guide them well.In the 'W' column, ask associating questions or liking questions to make them come to the thinking. questions like, [...] "what would you like to learn more about this idea?" [...] can help them to analyze and think more. The teacher here has to come prepared with her/his own set of questions that will link the students' questions to the idea in the text. This is done so that the student shall not lose the flow of the text as well as not lose the purpose of the activity.In the last column 'L', help the students to come out with their own creative ideas and analysis. Also in this particular column, the teacher shall <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> to differentiate between the answers to their questions and ideas in other columns and the idea they found interesting. At last, the teacher shall help the students to consult other sources which would answer their questions which are not mentioned in the text.|$|E
5000|$|Teachers and {{instructors}} {{usually have a}} lesson plan which dictates {{the structure of the}} teaching. A group of lessons may be linked together in a unit plan, scheme, or work. The detail of the plan may vary with some being a simple list of {{what is going to be}} taught in a lesson with others working including much more detail, such as a time plan and the learning aims and objectives. Student teachers and beginning teachers are usually advised to put a great amount of detail into the written plan. This ensures that the plan will be cohesive, that all the components of a successful lesson are taken care of, and that one has a checklist to ensure that practicalities are taken care of (e.g., resources, scheduling, and classroom management considerations). Furthermore, beginning teachers are often advised to script some sections for themselves, such as questions they might <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> in order to get a discussion going at the beginning of the lesson. The expectation is that the teachers can and should depart from the script when appropriate; improvisation is definitely encouraged and the fact of having written it out in advance ensures that an adequate amount of thought has been put into it ahead of time. Another reason for including a great amount of detail is that student teachers are often required to submit lesson plans in advance to their mentor teachers or professors in order to receive feedback on their ideas. When creating the lesson plan it is usual to look at the following: ...|$|E

She <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> to write alone and told them they would talk in groups and as a whole group later. After quietly writing down their thinking, <b>the</b> <b>students</b> discussed their answers in small groups.

50|$|A part of Technasium is {{the subject}} Research and Design. This subject can be taught {{starting}} from the first class of pre-university education or HAVO (higher general continued education). It is possible to start the course at a later stage, when choosing the courses {{to follow in the}} last three years of high school. A couple of projects are done each year within the O&O course. The Technasium education course mostly works with practical assignments, commissioned by real companies. These companies <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> to design something, to do research on a certain topic or to think of solutions for problems they are struggling with. The students present their findings at the end of the project.Often, these projects are composed for a group of students. The number of students depends on the assignment and varies, but is mostly from two to four students. It is up to the teacher to decide who forms the groups. It’s either the teacher himself who does, or the students can try to form groups with their classmates. Working together in a team is of major importance and the students learn to do this from the start. In the first three years, four technasium projects are done each year. An assignment has to be finished in 7 or 8 weeks, with 5 to 6 hours of O&O a week. In the pre-senior year, students get to choose two projects. They look for a company or institution which wants them to undertake a project from within the company. In the final year, the students will take their Mastertest. The students can once again decide what kind of project they like to do. Students have to spend 40 hours of work on a normal project, and 200 hours on the Mastertest.|$|E

50|$|Research by Vaugh (1999) {{looked at}} the effects of {{uncertainty}} {{on the use of}} the availability heuristic. College students were asked to list either three or eight different study methods they could use in order to get an A on their final exams. The researchers also manipulated the time during the semester they would <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> to complete the questionnaire. Approximately half of the participants were asked for their study methods during the third week of classes, and the other half were asked on last day of classes. Next, participants were asked to rate how likely they would be to get an A in their easiest and hardest classes. Participants were then asked to rank the difficulty they experienced in recalling the examples they had previously listed. The researchers hypothesized that students would use the availability heuristic, based on the number of study methods they listed, to predict their grade only when asked at the beginning of the semester and about their hardest final. Students were not expected to use the availability heuristic to predict their grade at the end of the semester or about their easiest final. The researchers predicted this use of availability heuristic because participants would be uncertain about their performance throughout the semester. The results indicated that students used the availability heuristic, based on the ease of recall of the study methods they listed, to predict their performance when asked at the beginning of the semester and about their hardest final. If the student listed only three study methods, they predicted a higher grade at the end of the semester only on their hardest final. If students listed eight study methods, they had a harder time recalling the methods and thus predicted a lower final grade on their hardest final. The results were not seen in the easy final condition because the students were certain they would get an A, regardless of study method. The results supported this hypothesis and gave evidence to the fact that levels of uncertainty affect the use of the availability heuristic.|$|E

[...] The study authors used scanned forms and hand-raising for audience response in the initial year of the study, and then they switched to a computer-based audience response system in the following years.

40|$|Teaching {{strategy}} {{is a specific}} method used by teachers in teaching and the ways for teacher to get success {{in teaching and learning}} process. In this study, teaching strategy refers to a specific plan to teach speaking for senior high school at SMAN 1 Ambunten Sumenep Madura. In this case, the writer wants to know the teaching strategy in speaking. This school is one of the famous schools in Ambunten Sumenep Madura which has complete extracurricular especially English. The aims of this study are to find out the teaching strategy in speaking used by English teacher, to find out how the strategy implemented, to find out the problems when implementing the strategy, and to find out the solutions of the problems. The research design of this study was descriptive research because it described the teaching strategy in speaking used by English teacher. Furthermore, the research approach used in this study was qualitative because it focused on the strategies used by English teacher in teaching speaking at SMAN 1 Ambunten Sumenep Madura. In addition, the data were presented in words or sentences. In collecting the data, the writer used two instruments, which were observation and interview. Based on the findings, the teacherÂ’s strategies were various. The researcher found that the teaching strategies used by the teacher were pair work, cooperative, and drilling strategies. In implementing the pair work strategy, <b>the</b> teacher <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> to read dialogue about expressing opinion. For the cooperative strategy, <b>the</b> teacher <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> to study English in groups. In addition, in drilling strategy, <b>the</b> teacher <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> to repeat and imitate words. Furthermore, there were several problems found when implementing the strategies. In implementing the pair work strategy, there were students who could not speak English {{in front of the class}} because they had limited vocabularies and did not know the grammar and pronunciation. In implementing the cooperative strategy, some students disturbed their friends when <b>the</b> teacher <b>asked</b> them to have a discussion because <b>the</b> <b>students</b> did not like studying English. In addition, in implementing the drilling strategy, there were students who could not pronounce some words when they tried to repeat and imitate the words which were on the dialogue. Moreover, the teacher showed pictures on <b>the</b> whiteboard then <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> to describe <b>the</b> pictures, <b>the</b> teacher <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> to watch a Western movie, and <b>the</b> teacher <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> to listen to English music were the solutions to overcome the problems...|$|R

There were some resources used by the researcher to help him in collecting data such as checklist, observation sheet, and interview guide. The data were described based on the planning, implementation of process standard in teaching and the assessment used in the lesson plan. Based on the findings and discussion, the researcher found some points related to the implementation of process standard in teaching English in SMK Negeri 1 Gianyar, namely: a) The English teachers at SMK Negeri 1 Gianyar still had problems in term of planning process standard in teaching English. It was found that the all subjects did not make the preparation for teaching English by themselves. They made it because of the formal supervision only. b) The English teachers at SMK Negeri 1 Gianyar did not fully apply the process standard in teaching English. c) It was found that the types of assessment used by the subjects in their lesson plan were spoken and written test. The assessment was not considered relevance because It did not cover three domains of learning. They were: cognitive domain, affective domain and psychomotor domain. In cognitive domain the teacher did not <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> to produce sentences and answering questions based on the topic. In affective domain, the teacher did not <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> to work in pair to make a dialog.
