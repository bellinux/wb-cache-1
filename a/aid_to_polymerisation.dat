40|$|The surface {{resistance}} of polypyrrole (PPy) -coated polyester fabrics was investigated {{and related to}} coating thickness, which was controlled by adjusting the reactant concentrations. The thickness of the coating initially increased rapidly followed by a steady increase when the concentration of pyrrole (Py) was larger than a concentration of approximately 0. 4 mg/ml. The {{surface resistance}} decreased from 10 6 to 10 3 Ω with increase in pyrrole concentration within 0. 2 mg/ml until the concentration reached a value of about 0. 4 mg/ml, above which the rate of decrease diminished. The effect of initial treatment with monomer or oxidant prior <b>to</b> <b>polymerisation</b> reaction with regards to thickness and surface resistance was minimal.

30|$|Nonetheless, {{the use of}} {{photo-sensitive}} {{material is}} primarily considered a limitation of this process. Another disadvantage {{of this process is}} associated with the shrinkage of the polymer due <b>to</b> <b>polymerisation.</b> Toxicity such as skin irritation and cytotoxicity caused by photo-sensitive resins also appears to be a major problem. Most recently, resins based on vinyl esters, an alternative resin that possesses better biocompatibility in vivo, have been explored (Heller et al. 2009).|$|R
50|$|The {{function}} of Stathmin is {{to regulate the}} cytoskeleton of the cell. The cytoskeleton {{is made up of}} long hollow cylinders named microtubules. These microtubules are made up of alpha and beta tubulin heterodimers. The changes in cytoskeleton are known as microtubule dynamics; the addition of the tubulin subunits lead <b>to</b> <b>polymerisation</b> and their loss, depolymerisation. Stathmin regulates these by promoting depolymerization of microtubules or preventing polymerization of tubulin heterodimers.|$|R

In order to appreciate the risk {{level of the}} <b>aids</b> <b>to</b> navigation (AtoNs) in a navigation channel and to provide some decision-making suggestions for the AtoNs Maintenance and Management Department, the risk assessment index system of the AtoNs was built considering the advanced experience of IALA.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a group of}} models showing the strikingly different implications of foreign <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> {{the private sector and}} public sector. In the first model, with decentralized decision-making and without optimal choices of fiscal policies on behalf of the government, foreign <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> the private sector has no effect on the long-run capital accumulation and it raises private consumption one to one; whereas foreign <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> the government leads to more public spending and higher private capital accumulation. In another model with optimal choices of both fiscal and monetary policies, foreign <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> the private sector gives rise to higher inflation and income taxation. Although <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> the private sector raises private money holdings and consumption, it reduces capital accumulation. However, when foreign <b>aid</b> is provided <b>to</b> the public sector, the government cuts both the inflation rate and the income tax rate, raises public spending, and provides more incentives for private capital accumulation and money holdings. In the long run, <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> the public sector leads to more private capital accumulation, consumption, money holdings, and welfare.
