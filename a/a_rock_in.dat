5|$|A mountainside, at the magician's cavern. Goffredo and Eustazio {{are told}} by the Magician that Almirena is being held captive in Armida's palace at the mountain-top. Ignoring the magician's warning that they will need special powers, the pair set off for the palace but are quickly driven back by Armida's monsters. The magician then gives them magic wands that transcend Armida's power, and they set off again. This time they {{overcome}} the monsters, but as they reach {{the gates of the}} palace it disappears, leaving them clinging to <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> the midst of a stormy sea. They climb the rock and descend out of sight.|$|E
5|$|Endecott {{used some}} of his {{properties}} to propagate fruit trees; a pear tree he planted still lives in Danvers, Massachusetts. He also engaged {{in one of the}} earliest attempts to develop a mining industry in the colonies when copper ore was found on his land. His name is found on <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> Lake Winnipesaukee, carved by surveyors sent to identify the Massachusetts colony's northern border in 1652. Places and institutions are named for him, and (like many early colonists) he has several notable descendants.|$|E
5|$|Sully {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée {{shipyard}} in La Seyne on 24 May 1899 and launched on 4 June 1901. The ship was completed in June 1904 and sent to French Indochina for her first commission. On 7 February 1905 Sully struck <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> Hạ Long Bay; her crew was not injured. Her guns and equipment were salvaged, but the ship broke in two and was abandoned as a total loss.|$|E

5|$|France sank after {{striking}} <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> Quiberon Bay in 1922. Between {{the wars}} the surviving ships were modernised several times, {{but they were}} not rebuilt thoroughly enough to prevent them from becoming obsolete in comparison to modern German or Italian battleships. They were relegated to training duties during the 1930s. Courbet and Paris escaped to Portsmouth where they became depot and accommodation ships after the French armistice in 1940. Jean Bart was demilitarised, renamed Océan, and became a school hulk in Toulon. She was captured there on 27 November 1942, although she was not scuttled. She was used for experiments with large shaped charge warheads by the Germans until she was sunk by the Allies in 1944, later broken up in place in 1945. Courbet was scuttled on 9 June 1944 as a breakwater for a Mulberry harbour used during the Battle of Normandy.|$|E
5|$|In March 1901 the {{battleship}} grounded again, {{this time in}} the harbor of Pensacola, Florida, but the ship was able to continue her trip. A more serious accident occurred during target practice in January 1903, when an explosion in an 8-inch turret killed nine crew members. They were the first fatalities aboard a United States battleship since the sinking of the Maine. Another accident happened in August of that year, when Massachusetts grounded on <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> Frenchman Bay, Maine. The ship was seriously damaged and had to be repaired in drydock. In December 1904 yet another lethal accident took place aboard Massachusetts: three men were killed and several others badly burned when a broken gasket caused steam to fill the boiler room. On 8 January 1906 {{the battleship}} was decommissioned and her crew was transferred to her sister ship Indiana, which had completed a three-year modernization. Massachusetts now received the same upgrades, including twelve 3"/50 caliber gun single-purpose guns to replace the 6-inch and most of the lighter guns, new Babcock & Wilcox boilers, counterweights to balance her main turrets, a lattice mast and electric traversing mechanisms for her turrets.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Ludwig {{venture into}} the {{volcanic}} caves to find Trepkos. When they find Firewalker, Trepkos shoots Ludwig {{in the back with}} a flare gun, killing him. He then burns Ludwig's body, as he was infected with the spore as well. Trepkos tells Mulder that after Firewalker returned from its first descent, Erickson pulverized <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> one of its samples, resulting in his death and the infection of all the scientists immediately surrounding him. Trepkos says that the spore is parasitic in nature, making its hosts pass itself on to others. Meanwhile, in the lab, an infected O'Neil handcuffs herself to Scully to expose her to the spore, forcing Scully to use a hammer to split the chains but to no avail, so she instead protects herself by throwing O'Neil into a sealed chamber and closing the door. A protrusion then bursts out of O'Neil's throat, killing her without spreading the spore to Scully.|$|E

5|$|The action brought repercussions for Smith, whose {{failure to}} support Osborne was noted; {{although}} Smith {{claimed that he}} was simply maintaining the line of battle, it subsequently emerged that the captains had engaged in a personal dispute resulting in Smith deciding to refuse Osborne's orders. After his behaviour had featured in Osborne's initial dispatch, Smith challenged his account and Osborne demanded a court-martial held to investigate. This panel decided that Smith's behaviour was unacceptable and he was dismissed from the Navy, by which time he had lost Diomede, wrecked on <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> Trincomalee Bay on 2 August 1795 during the invasion of Ceylon. Although Smith appealed his sentence and was restored to the captain's list in 1798 he was never again called to service and retired in 1806.|$|E
5|$|The sisters {{remained}} with the 2nd Battle Squadron into early 1919, after which King George V became the flagship of the 3rd Battle Squadron until that unit was disbanded later that year. The ship then became flagship of the Reserve Fleet and served until late 1920. In the meantime, Ajax had {{been transferred to}} 4th Battle Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet by mid-1919 and sometimes served as the Fleet's flagship. Centurion followed in early 1920, although she {{spent a lot of}} time in reserve in Malta. The sisters played minor roles in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War in the Black Sea in 1919–1920. King George V joined them in the 4th Battle Squadron in early 1921. After striking <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> early September 1922, she was in Smyrna, Turkey, receiving temporary repairs when the Great Fire of Smyrna occurred later that month and evacuated some refugees when she sailed for permanent repairs at Malta. Her sisters were in Turkish waters during the Chanak Crisis around the same time. King George V was the first of the trio to return home in early 1923 and she served a training ship until she was sold for scrap at the end of 1926. Ajax and Centurion followed in April 1924, although they were placed in reserve, with the latter serving as the flagship of the Reserve Fleet. Like King George V, Ajax was sold for scrap at the end of 1926.|$|E

25|$|On July 30 of that year, Sauro's {{boat was}} sent over {{to carry out}} a {{sabotage}} in the Hungarian port of Fiume (now Rijeka in Croatia), but it crashed into <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> the Kvarner Gulf. The crew was intercepted by the Austro-Hungarian destroyer Satellit, and imprisoned. Sauro was recognized and placed on trial for his previous act of treason, and, after facing a military tribunal in Pola (now Pula in Croatia) was sentenced to death and hanged.|$|E
25|$|Following {{her return}} from the trans-Pacific voyage, Thiepval {{returned}} to patrol work and training duties. In 1925, {{she came to the}} assistance of another Battle-class trawler, Armentières, which had struck <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> Pipestem Inlet in Barkley Sound. The following year, she towed the Mexican schooner Chapultepec off the rocks at Carmnanah Point, on the southwest coast of Vancouver Island. Mostly, however, her routine consisted of fisheries and search and rescue patrols, as well as chasing rum-runners.|$|E
25|$|Wet powder led to {{a failed}} test firing of the {{submarine}} gun and the ship was grounded to remove the projectile. But the strain of the swell {{led to a}} further leak. Following further repairs the Destroyer made for Bahia with replenishments of powder for the Brazilian fleet, arriving on 13 February. Once there, however, Admiral Goncalves of the Brazilian navy seized the ship. At the Arsenal at Bahia, an apparently incompetent alternative crew grounded the Destroyer on <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> the basin. The vessel was holed and subsequently abandoned.|$|E

25|$|Pippin {{picked up}} the palantír of Orthanc after Gríma Wormtongue threw it at them. Later, obsessed by the mysterious stone, Pippin took it out of Gandalf's hands while the wizard slept, putting <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> its place. Looking into the stone, he had a terrifying {{encounter}} with Sauron himself. In fact, Pippin is the only character in the book who is shown to speak directly to Sauron. To keep Pippin safe from Sauron's forces, Gandalf {{brought him to the}} city of Minas Tirith, separating him from his friends.|$|E
25|$|Kwinana {{suffered}} {{a number of}} mishaps in SSS service. In 1914 she {{suffered a}} fire in coal in her No. 2 hold. Then on 28 August 1914 she struck <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> Cambridge Gulf, damaging hull plates beneath her engine room. On 3 November 1917 she suffered machinery damage at Broome, WA. On 19 August 1918 in Cambridge Gulf her steering gear failed and she went aground. On 24 March 1920 while she was loading cargo at Christmas Island a leak developed in her in No. 1 hold. On 10 December 1920 {{while she was in}} Fremantle her starboard boiler sprang a leak.|$|E
25|$|These events, {{along with}} the fear of atrocities stirred up by the Nazi {{propaganda}} before, caused a mass panic among the population. Many local and refugee families killed themselves together. The suicides were either performed with guns, razor blades or poison, others hanged or drowned themselves in the Peene and Tollense rivers. Several mothers killed their children before killing themselves, or walked {{into one of the}} rivers with <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> a backpack and their babies in their arms. Some families died by walking into the rivers, tied together. A local forester first shot three young children, then their mothers, then his wife and then himself, surviving as a blind man. In another recorded case, a daughter cut the wrists of her parents.|$|E

25|$|Anthony Thistlethwaite was an {{original}} {{member of the}} band, and remained a member until 1991 when the band broke up, although he also joined a few recording sessions for <b>A</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>in</b> the Weary Land. After Scott and Wickham, Thistlethwaite has more songwriting credits than any other Waterboy. His saxophone, regularly featured in solos, was {{one half of the}} early group's distinctive brass section, but he has also played guitar, keyboards {{and a number of other}} instruments for the band. He pressed to return The Waterboys to a rock music sound after Room to Roam, but did not appear on Dream Harder, the result of that decision. He is now a member of The Saw Doctors, and has also released three solo albums.|$|E
25|$|Then, {{high on a}} crag jutting {{over the}} river just above the cataract, she saw him! Her lost lover had not forgotten. Even above {{the roar of the}} water she heard him call her name. She stood in the canoe, waved her arms and screamed for help. Though he knew his chances of saving his beloved were slim at best, the young Englishman did not {{hesitate}} for a moment. He leaped from the overhanging bluff and plunged into the whitened water, just as Lillinonah's canoe struck <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> the middle of the river and capsized, spilling her into the frothy current. Swiftly as he could, he swam to her side and clasped her body to him. Alas, neither realized that it was already too late. Still wrapped in loving embrace, the doomed pair disappeared into the boiling falls and were crushed to death as they were hurled to the rocks in the broad pool below.|$|E
25|$|Unlike sculptures done by his predecessors, these {{focus on}} {{specific}} points of narrative {{tension in the}} stories {{they are trying to}} tell: Aeneas and his family fleeing the burning Troy; the instant that Pluto finally grasps the hunted Persephone; the precise moment that Apollo sees his beloved Daphne begin her transformation into a tree. They are transitory but dramatic powerful moments in each story. Bernini's David is another stirring example of this. Michelangelo's motionless, idealized David shows the subject holding <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> one hand and a sling in the other, contemplating the battle; similarly immobile versions by other Renaissance artists, including Donatello's, show the subject in his triumph after the battle with Goliath. Bernini illustrates David during his active combat with the giant, as he twists his body to catapult toward Goliath. To emphasize these moments, and to ensure that they were appreciated by the viewer, Bernini designed the sculptures with a specific viewpoint in mind. Their original placements within the Villa Borghese were against walls so that the viewers' first view was the dramatic moment of the narrative.|$|E
