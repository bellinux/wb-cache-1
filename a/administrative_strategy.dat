The population for this study was the 130 gifted/talented programs at the elementary level in Indiana during the 1983 - 84 school year. Two samples were included in this study. The first sample included 13 school districts identified as best current practice by a random sample of gifted/talented cadre members from Indiana. The second sample had 22 gifted/talented programs with five different administrative strategies identified as best current practice by a random sample of gifted/talented cadre members. The five strategies are advanced classes, classroom enrichment, mentor program, pullout/resource room, and special school. ^ Four statistical procedures were used to reject or not reject hypotheses. Multiple Regression, Analysis of Variance, Student 2 ̆ 7 s t-test, and Pearson r were performed. ^ The study was designed to answer seven questions and the following conclusions flow from the hypotheses that were developed to answer said questions. (1) The cost of gifted/talented programs is higher than the cost of regular instructional education with an average cost index of 1. 32. (2) Two administrative strategies, mentor program, and pullout/resource room, cost more than regular instructional education. Three strategies, advanced classes, classroom enrichment and special school, do not cost more. (3) No important correlation exists between gifted/talented programs costs and existence of Gallagher 2 ̆ 7 s essential elements.

Even seemingly technical prescriptions run up against local political and social realities which make their adoption difficult and, if adopted, require significant modification of the original prescriptions.

Recent trends have continued to favour this shift towards deregulation of the state's administrative structures.

In order to improve long-term sustainability in all aspects: equitable water and sanitation access, public health risks and environmental impact and operational costs, water and sewage systems with household connections are being implemented. In this shift from emergency to sustainable phase, urban infrastructure selection and design methods were found to be beneficial and adapted for the situation.

Chapter Two demonstrates that Richard Nixon 2 ̆ 7 s belief in the individual 2 ̆ 7 s power to control one 2 ̆ 7 s life best explains his decisions to decentralize government through reorganization and revenue sharing. Chapter Three concludes that Jimmy Carter 2 ̆ 7 s belief in a progressive agenda to democratize government best explains his decision to reorganize government from the 2 ̆ 2 bottom-up 2 ̆ 2 and {{through the use of}} zero base budgeting. Chapter Four finds that Ronald Reagan 2 ̆ 7 s decisions to reorganize the executive branch from 2 ̆ 2 within 2 ̆ 2 and to alter the budget process are best explained by his belief in government as an agent for social change, but only in specific areas of activity. ^ Chapter Five concludes the research by briefly examining the Bush presidency, and concludes that Bush, like Jimmy Carter, is a president more concerned with 2 ̆ 2 process 2 ̆ 2 than 2 ̆ 2 policy. 2 ̆ 2 Each 2 ̆ 2 classic 2 ̆ 2 methodology is demonstrated to be flawed, and the 2 ̆ 2 belief 2 ̆ 2 model is shown to best explain the behavior of each president.
