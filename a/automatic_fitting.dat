40|$|Two {{types of}} <b>automatic</b> <b>fitting</b> {{procedures}} for EPR spectra of disordered {{systems have been}} developed, one based on matrix diagonalisation of a general spin Hamiltonian, the other on 2 nd order perturbation theory. The first program {{is based on a}} previous Fortran code complemented with a newly written interface in Java to provide user-friendly in- and output. The second is intended for the special case of free radicals with several relatively weakly interacting nuclei, in which case the general method becomes slow. A least squares’ fitting procedure utilizing analytical or numerical derivatives of the theoretically calculated spectrum with respect to the g-and hyperfine structure (hfs) tensors was used to refine those parameters in both cases. ‘Rigid limit’ ESR spectra from radicals in organic matrices and in polymers, previously studied experimentally at low temperature, were analysed by both methods. Fluoro-carbon anion radicals could be simulated, quite accurately with the exact method, whereas <b>automatic</b> <b>fitting</b> on e. g. the c-C 4 F 8 - anion radical is only feasible with the 2 nd order approximative treatment. Initial values for the 19 F hfs tensors estimated by DFT calculations were quite close to the final. For neutral radicals of the type XCF 2 CF 2 • the refinement of the hfs tensors by the exact method worked better than the approximate. The reasons are discussed. The ability of the fitting procedures to recover the correct magnetic parameters of disordered systems was investigated by fittings to synthetic spectra with known hfs tensors. The exact and the approximate methods are concluded to be complementary, one being general, but limited to relatively small systems, the other being a special treatment, suited for S=½ systems with several moderately large hfs.

40|$|Multi-chamber heart {{segmentation}} is {{a prerequisite}} for quantification of the cardiac function. In this paper, we propose an automatic heart chamber segmentation system. There are two closely related tasks to develop such a system: heart modeling and <b>automatic</b> model <b>fitting</b> to an unseen volume. The heart is a complicated non-rigid organ with four chambers and several major vessel trunks attached. A flexible and accurate model is necessary to capture the heart chamber shape at an appropriate level of details. In our four-chamber surface mesh model, the following two factors are considered and traded-off: 1) accuracy in anatomy and 2) easiness for both annotation and automatic detection. Important landmarks such as valves and cusp points on the interventricular septum are explicitly represented in our model. These landmarks can be detected reliably to guide the <b>automatic</b> model <b>fitting</b> process. We also propose two mechanisms, the rotation-axis based and parallel-slice based resampling methods, to establish mesh point correspondence, which is necessary to build a statistical shape model to enforce priori shape constraints in the model fitting procedure. Using this model, we develop an efficient and robust approach for automatic heart chamber segmentation in 3 D computed tomography (CT) volumes. Our approach is based on recent advances in learning discriminative object models and we exploit a large database of annotated CT volumes. We formulate the segmentation as a twoste...|$|R

40|$|We propose an {{automatic}} four-chamber heart segmentation {{system for the}} quantitative functional analysis of the heart from cardiac computed tomography (CT) volumes. Two topics are discussed: heart modeling and <b>automatic</b> model <b>fitting</b> to an unseen volume. Heart modeling is a non-trivial task since the heart is a complex nonrigid organ. The model must be anatomically accurate, allow manual editing, and provide sufficient information to guide automatic detection and segmentation. Unlike previous work, we explicitly represent important landmarks (such as the valves and the ventricular septum cusps) among the control points of the model. The control points can be detected reliably to guide the <b>automatic</b> model <b>fitting</b> process. Using this model, we develop an efficient and robust approach for automatic heart chamber segmentation in 3 D CT volumes. We formulate the segmentation as a two-step learning problem: anatomical structure localization and boundary delineation. In both steps, we exploit the recent advances in learning discriminative models. A novel algorithm, marginal space learning (MSL), is introduced to solve the 9 -dimensional similarity transformation search problem for localizing the heart chambers. After determining the pose of the heart chambers, we estimate the 3 D shape through learning-based boundary delineation. The proposed method has been extensively tested on the largest dataset (with 323 volumes from 137 patients) ever reported in the literature.

We introduce a prioritized front growing scheme in the process of local quadrics fitting. Flatter surface areas tend to grow faster.

40|$|Image {{restoration}} including deconvolution techniques {{offers a}} powerful tool to improve resolution in images and to extract information on the multiscale structure stored in astronomical observations. We present a new method for statistical deconvolution, which we call expectation through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (EMC 2). This method is designed to remedy several shortfalls of currently used deconvolution and restoration techniques for Poisson data. We use a wavelet-like multiscale representation of the true image to achieve smoothing at all scales of resolution simultaneously, thus capturing detailed features in the image {{at the same time}} as larger scale extended features. Thus, this method smooths the image, while maintaining the ability to effectively reconstruct point sources and sharp features in the image. We use a principled, fully Bayesian model–based analysis, which produces extensive information about the uncertainty in the fitted smooth image, allowing assessment of the errors in the resulting reconstruction.

40|$|We {{present a}} biorthogonal wavelet {{construction}} based on Catmull-Clark-style subdivision volumes. Our wavelet transform is the three-dimensional extension of a previously developed construction of subdivision-surface wavelets {{that was used}} for multiresolution modeling of large-scale isosurfaces. Subdivision surfaces provide a flexible modeling tool for surfaces of arbitrary topology and for functions defined thereon. Wavelet representations add the ability to compactly represent large-scale geometries at multiple levels of detail. Our wavelet construction based on subdivision volumes extends these concepts to trivariate geometries, such as time-varying surfaces, free-form deformations, and solid models with non-uniform material properties. The domains of the represented trivariate functions are defined by lattices composed of arbitrary polyhedral cells. These are recursively subdivided based on stationary rules converging to piecewise smooth limit-geometries. Sharp features and boundaries, defined by specific polygons, edges, and vertices of a lattice are explicitly represented using modified subdivision rules. Our wavelet transform provides the ability to reverse the subdivision process after a lattice has been re-shaped at a very fine level of detail, for example using an <b>automatic</b> <b>fitting</b> method.
