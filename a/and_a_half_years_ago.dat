2500|$|Cindy McLennan of Television Without Pity {{rated the}} episode with a grade C+. She criticizes {{the idea of}} the hot-pharmaceutical girl as unoriginal, saying it [...] "was funny seven <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> when Heather Locklear played one on Scrubs".

This time I really got angry. I wrote this song for those who break people's heart without thinking first, who make a mountain out of a molehill with their words." ...|$|E
2500|$|Baldwin {{supported}} the Munich Agreement {{and said to}} Chamberlain on 26 September 1938: [...] "If you can secure peace, you may be cursed {{by a lot of}} hotheads but my word you will be blessed in Europe and by future generations". Baldwin made a rare speech in the House of Lords on 4 October where he said he could not have gone to Munich but praised Chamberlain's courage and said the responsibility of a Prime Minister was not to commit the country to war until he was sure that it was ready to fight. If there was a 95% chance of war in the future, he would still choose peace. He also said he would put industry on a war footing tomorrow as the opposition to such a move had disappeared. Churchill said in a speech: [...] "He says he would mobilise tomorrow. I {{think it would have been}} much better if Earl Baldwin had said that two <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> when everyone demanded a Ministry of Supply".|$|E

2500|$|The cave began forming about {{a million}} to a million <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> {{in a manner similar}} to many caves. A large crack in the surface of the rock, called the cave's [...] "lifeline", allowed rain water to seep into the stone. In the air, rain {{combines}} with carbon dioxide to form a weak carbonic acid. Though this acid is not very strong, it is strong enough to dissolve away the limestone after it seeps in through the [...] "lifeline". Over time, large cavities were dissolved in the stone and as the water table dropped, the water drained out and the cavities filled with air. Now that the cavities are filled with air instead of water, the water droplets coming from the [...] "lifeline", which are saturated with dissolved calcium carbonate, deposit solid calcium carbonate, which builds up over time to create speleothems. This is a very gradual process, usually taking 50 to 150 years to form one cubic inch of material, and continues to this day.|$|E
2500|$|The footage shows {{interviewer}} Steve Murphy asking Dion the question: [...] "If {{you were}} the Prime Minister now, {{what would you have}} done about the economy, and this crisis, that Mr. Harper has not done?". [...] Dion had difficulty in understanding the question, repeatedly asking Murphy to clarify if he meant if Dion was Prime Minister now, next Tuesday on election day, last week, last month, 60 weeks ago, or two <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> [...] Eventually, after three start overs to the interview, Dion responded with what he would do if elected Prime Minister in the future. CTV initially agreed to restart the interviews and not air the false starts but changed their minds and announced that they felt it was their responsibility to show it. Harper responded to the clips by saying that [...] "When you're running a trillion-and-a-half-dollar economy you don't get a chance to have do-overs, over and over again" [...] and [...] "What this incident actually indicates very clearly is Mr. Dion and the Liberal Party really don't know what they would do on the economy", and when told that the difficulties were in part due to English being Dion's second language, Harper said: [...] "I don't think this is a question of language at all. The question was very clear. It was asked repeatedly".|$|E

So that, at the end of ten years, by reinvesting the profits, your money will be more than doubled, and you will have a nice fortune when you choose to come home, even if the jewels do not fetch anything like what you expect." ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{good friend}} of ours--in fact one of our very best--spoke to me here {{a few days ago}} of your having lately had (all unknown to me) a great tribulation of illness; but also told me, to my lively relief, that you are getting {{steadily}} well again and that (thankful at the worst for small mercies after such an ordeal) you are in some degree accessible to the beguilement and consolation of letters. I have only taken time to wonder whether just such a mercy as this may not be even below the worst--but am letting the question rest on the basis of my feeling that you must never, and that you will never, dream of any [...] "acknowledging" [...] of so inevitable a little sign of sympathy. Such dreams, I too well know, only aggravate and hamper the upward struggle, don't in the least lighten or quicken it. Take absolute example by me--who had a very dismal bad illness two <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> (from out of the blackness of which I haven't even now wholly emerged,) and who reflect with positive complacency on all my letters, the received ones, of that time, that still, and that largely always will, remain unanswered. I want you to be complacent too--though at this rate there won't be much for you to be so about! I really hope you go on smoothly and serenely--and am glad now that I didn't helplessly know you were so stricken. But I wish I had for you a few solid chunks of digestible (that is, mainly good) news--such as, given your constitutional charity, will melt in your mouth. (There are people for whom only the other sort is digestible.) But I somehow in these subdued days--I speak of my own very personal ones--don't make news; I even rather dread breaking out into it, or having it break into me: it's so much oftener-- ...|$|E
