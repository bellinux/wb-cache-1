5|$|Following Indian {{independence}} in 1947, Kalimpong {{became part of}} the state of West Bengal, after Bengal was partitioned between India and East Pakistan. With China's annexation of Tibet in 1959, many Buddhist monks fled Tibet and established monasteries in Kalimpong. These monks brought many rare Buddhist scriptures with them. In 1962, the permanent closure of the Jelep Pass after the Sino-Indian War disrupted trade between Tibet and India, and led to <b>a</b> <b>slowdown</b> in Kalimpong's economy. In 1976, the visiting Dalai Lama consecrated the Zang Dhok Palri Phodang monastery, which houses many of the scriptures.|$|E

40|$|The {{expected}} {{slowdown in}} {{the economy of the}} United States (US) has ignited increasing concerns over the short-term growth prospect of East Asia. Historically, <b>a</b> US <b>slowdown</b> has often been associated with <b>a</b> global <b>slowdown.</b> East Asia has been particularly vulnerable to slowing US growth, given its relatively high export reliance on the US market. During the last slump in 20012 ̆ 0132002, a drop in US imports immediately translated into falling exports, cuts in industrial production, and declining growth rates in East Asia. Using the Oxford Economics' Global Model, this paper examines the possible impacts on East Asia of a sharper and longer US slowdown than is currently anticipated by the Asian Development Bank in its Asian Development Outlook 2007. The results of the simulation exercises suggest that the impact of <b>a</b> US <b>slowdown</b> on its own would not significantly impact growth in East Asia. However, if <b>a</b> US <b>slowdown</b> instigates disorderly adjustments in international financial markets and spills over into the People's Republic of China, the remainder of East Asia would not be spared...|$|R

5|$|Keynes {{contended that}} {{economic}} output is {{positively correlated with}} money velocity. He explained the relationship via changing liquidity preferences: people increase their money holdings during times of economic difficulty by reducing their spending, which further slows the economy. This paradox of thrift claimed that individual attempts to survive a downturn only worsen it. When the demand for money increases, money velocity slows. <b>A</b> <b>slowdown</b> in economic activities means markets might not clear, leaving excess goods to waste and capacity to idle. Turning the quantity theory on its head, Keynes argued that market changes shift quantities rather than prices. Keynes replaced the assumption of stable velocity with one of a fixed price-level. If spending falls and prices do not, the surplus of goods reduces the need for workers and increases unemployment.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th century, {{however, the}} {{expansion}} of European trade – albeit restricted to islands near Guangzhou like Macau – spread the Columbian Exchange of crops, plants, and animals into China, introducing chili peppers to Sichuan cuisine and highly productive corn and potatoes, which diminished famines and spurred population growth. The growth of Portuguese, Spanish, and Dutch trade created new demand for Chinese products and produced a massive influx of Japanese and American silver. This abundance of specie remonetized the Ming economy, whose paper money had suffered repeated hyperinflation and was no longer trusted. While traditional Confucians opposed such a prominent role for commerce and the newly rich it created, the heterodoxy introduced by Wang Yangming permitted a more accommodating attitude. Zhang Juzheng's initially successful reforms proved devastating when <b>a</b> <b>slowdown</b> in agriculture produced by the Little Ice Age joined changes in Japanese and Spanish policy that quickly cut off the supply of silver now necessary for farmers {{to be able to}} pay their taxes. Combined with crop failure, floods, and epidemic, the dynasty collapsed before the rebel leader Li Zicheng, who was defeated by the Manchu-led Eight Banner armies who founded the Qing dynasty.|$|E

40|$|In the 1960 s Gisbert Hasenjaeger built Turing Machines from {{electromechanical}} relays and uniselectors. Recently, Glaschick reverse {{engineered the}} program {{of one of these}} machines and found that it is a universal Turing machine. In fact, its program uses only four states and two symbols, making it a very small universal Turing machine. (The machine has three tapes {{and a number of other}} features that are important to keep in mind when comparing it to other small universal machines.) Hasenjaeger’s machine simulates Hao Wang’s B machines, which were proved universal by Wang. Unfortunately, Wang’s original simulation algorithm suffers from <b>an</b> exponential <b>slowdown</b> when simulating Turing machines. Hence, via this simulation, Hasenjaeger’s machine also has <b>an</b> exponential <b>slowdown</b> when simulating Turing machines. In this work, we give a new efficient simulation algorithm for Wang’s B machines by showing that they simulate Turing machines with only <b>a</b> polynomial <b>slowdown.</b> <b>As</b> a second result, we find that Hasenjaeger’s machine also efficiently simulates Turing machines in polynomial time. Thus, Hasenjaeger’s machine is both small and fast. In another application of our result, we show that Hooper’s small universal Turing machine simulates Turing machines in polynomial time, an exponential improvement...|$|R
5|$|Einsatzgruppe B, C, and D did not {{immediately}} follow Einsatzgruppe A's example in systematically killing all Jews in their areas. The Einsatzgruppe commanders, {{with the exception of}} Einsatzgruppe A's Stahlecker, were of the opinion by the fall of 1941 {{that it was impossible to}} kill the entire Jewish population of the Soviet Union in one sweep, and thought the killings should stop. An Einsatzgruppe report dated 17 September advised that the Germans would be better off using any skilled Jews as labourers rather than shooting them. Also, in some areas poor weather and a lack of transportation led to <b>a</b> <b>slowdown</b> in deportations of Jews from points further west. Thus, an interval passed between the first round of Einsatzgruppen massacres in summer and fall, and what American historian Raul Hilberg called the second sweep, which started in December 1941 and lasted into the summer of 1942. During the interval, the surviving Jews were forced into ghettos.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{government}} identified basic {{supplies that}} it needed {{in response to the}} storm; those included various foods, clothing, medicine, shelter supplies, and sanitation equipment. The country made a formal request for international assistance, noting that the storm was the worst in 100years, and officials had limited resources due to the unexpected destruction. Prior to the request, the government of Switzerland sent about 500,000 Swiss francs ($360,000 USD) for immediate relief assistance. Subsequently, ten other countries sent cash or relief supplies worth $2.6 million, including medical shelters from the United States, clothing from the United Kingdom, tents from Russia, and transport goods from Japan. Red Cross workers had to travel by riverboat to bring aid to the most affected communities, due to the poor state of the roads. After two months, the Red Cross distributed 65,401 roofing sheets, 390 metric tons of rice, 11,990 mosquito nets, 6,871 blankets, 3,664 medical kits, and abundant clothing supplies to about 150,000 affected people; the supplies were purchased in Ho Chi Minh City. Eventually, the food supply and health status of the storm victims proved not as bad as originally feared. After the assistance was distributed, the Red Cross shifted focus toward reconstruction. Reconstruction was slow, partly due to <b>a</b> <b>slowdown</b> in economic activity from the Vietnamese New Year. Additionally, the two primary factories responsible for making iron and construction frames were only intermittently open, due to machines failing.|$|E
