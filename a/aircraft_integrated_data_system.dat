30|$|In conclusion, {{there are}} {{significant}} challenges, and interdisciplinary research needs to assess the interactions of climate change with water, energy, and food and related ecosystem processes. Lack of these <b>integrated</b> models and <b>data</b> <b>systems</b> {{makes it difficult to}} measure and evaluate these complex interactions and quantify the multiple benefits, costs, and trade-offs between these multiple sectors. The examples and case studies noted here have been used to identify complexity, knowledge gaps, and future research needs to address these significant challenges at the regional scale. It is vital to bridge knowledge gaps and support future research by improving coordinated data collection and developing integrated models and tools as well as <b>integrated</b> <b>data</b> <b>systems.</b> Questions about how to evaluate, quantify, and measure interactions of climate change with water, energy, and food and related ecosystem processes still need further research and discussion among ecologists and multidisciplinary scientists.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To suggest {{improvements}} to 13 <b>data</b> sets and <b>systems</b> that collect information about juvenile victimization in United States. Method: The suggestions were gathered {{from a variety}} of sources, including <b>data</b> <b>system</b> users and administrators, as well as a special meeting convened on the topic by the National Consortium on Children, Families and the Law in Washington, DC (December 2000). Results: Key areas of improvement were identified for each of 13 US <b>data</b> <b>systems</b> and possible solutions were identified. Conclusions: This paper suggests three broad categories of improvements that apply to a number of <b>data</b> <b>systems.</b> First, <b>data</b> <b>systems</b> could expand the coverage of the systems to include more jurisdictions or other segments of the population. Second, in order to be more comprehensive and specific to child victimization, the systems need to create more specific data items, questions, or response categories. Finally, the <b>data</b> <b>systems</b> need to be modified to provide continuity and interrelationships among systems, either by using uniform definitions, or <b>integrating</b> <b>data</b> <b>systems</b> to facilitate the tracking of children across systems. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The introduction of this aircraft in 1978 heralded a revolution in taking over the task of ensuring stability in flight from the traditional aerodynamic stabilizers. This use of [...] "relaxed static stability" [...] allowed aircraft to be made more manoeuvrable and to be given an artificial [...] "feel" [...] to aid pilots in their main task.

40|$|Trusted digital {{repositories}} {{manage the}} integrity and authenticity of records through multiple generations of technology. They provide mechanisms to validate assertions about trustworthiness and provide the preservation processes that implement the required control and management capabilities. Today there are multiple technologies {{that can be used}} to build a digital repository that is capable of maintaining the authenticity and integrity of ingested documents. The approaches range from solutions based on data grids (Storage Resource Broker), to solutions based on digital library systems (DSpace and Fedora), to solutions based on rule-oriented environments (<b>integrated</b> Rule-Oriented <b>Data</b> <b>System).</b> These approaches optimize management of different components of a trusted digital repository. No single system currently provides all of the required functionality.

40|$|The {{authors would}} like to thank the National Science Foundation (NSF). This work was {{motivated}} by a contract work for the NSF to develop SESTAT variance estimation procedures. The authors take the sole responsibility for the interpretations and conclusions in this article. Key words: SESTAT, replication method, combined dataset Several survey data are often combined into one dataset to represent the population covered by those surveys. In many cases each survey component has its own replication method for variance estimation which accounts for its sample design and other adjustment procedures. However, replication methods used for each component survey are not necessarily same. Consequently a way to combine replicate weights from each survey is desirable. The Scientist and Engineers Statistical <b>Data</b> <b>System</b> (SESTAT) is an <b>integrated</b> <b>data</b> <b>system</b> combining three independent surveys. We constructed combined replicate weights for the SESTAT based on individual survey specific replicate weights and evaluated variance estimates based on the combined replicate weights. Empirical results show that in practice this approach is preferable over the approach that approximates the replicate weights by using unified replication method. 1...|$|R
