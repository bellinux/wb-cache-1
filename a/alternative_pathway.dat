25|$|The <b>alternative</b> <b>pathway</b> is {{continuously}} activated {{at a low}} level, {{analogous to}} a car engine at idle, {{as a result of}} spontaneous C3 hydrolysis due to the breakdown of the internal thioester bond (C3 is mildly unstable in aqueous environment). The <b>alternative</b> <b>pathway</b> does not rely on pathogen-binding antibodies like the other pathways. C3b that is generated from C3 by a C3 convertase enzyme complex in the fluid phase is rapidly inactivated by factor H and factor I, as is the C3b-like C3 that is the product of spontaneous cleavage of the internal thioester. In contrast, when the internal thioester of C3 reacts with a hydroxyl or amino group of a molecule on the surface of a cell or pathogen, the C3b that is now covalently bound to the surface is protected from factor H-mediated inactivation. The surface-bound C3b may now bind factor B to form C3bB. This complex in the presence of factor D will be cleaved into Ba and Bb. Bb will remain associated with C3b to form C3bBb, which is the <b>alternative</b> <b>pathway</b> C3 convertase.|$|E

25|$|Independent of {{nitric oxide}} synthase, an <b>alternative</b> <b>pathway,</b> coined the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway, elevates nitric oxide through the {{sequential}} reduction of dietary nitrate derived from plant-based foods.

For the body to generate nitric oxide through the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway, the reduction of nitrate to nitrite (by nitrate reductase, a bacterial enzyme) occurs in the mouth, by commensal bacteria, an obligatory and necessary step.

2500|$|Most of the {{proteins}} and glycoproteins {{that constitute the}} complement system are synthesized by hepatocytes. But significant amounts are also produced by tissue macrophages, blood monocytes, and epithelial cells of the genitourinal tract and gastrointestinal tract. The three pathways of activation all generate homologous variants of the protease C3-convertase. The classical complement pathway typically requires antigen—antibody complexes (immune complexes) for activation (specific immune response), whereas the <b>alternative</b> <b>pathway</b> can be activated by C3 hydrolysis, foreign material, pathogens, or damaged cells. The mannose-binding lectin pathway can be activated by C3 hydrolysis or antigens without the presence of antibodies (non-specific immune response). In all three pathways, C3-convertase cleaves and activates component C3, creating C3a and C3b, and causes a cascade of further cleavage and activation events. [...] C3b binds {{to the surface of}} pathogens, leading to greater internalization by phagocytic cells by opsonization.|$|E
2500|$|In the <b>alternative</b> <b>pathway,</b> C3b binds to Factor B. [...] Factor D {{releases}} Factor Ba from Factor B {{bound to}} C3b. [...] The complex of C3b(2)Bb is a protease which cleaves C5 into C5b and C5a. C5 convertase is also {{formed by the}} Classical Pathway when C3b binds C4b and C2a. C5a is an important chemotactic protein, helping recruit inflammatory cells. C3a is the precursor of an important cytokine (adipokine) named ASP (although this is not universally accepted [...] ) and is usually rapidly cleaved by carboxypeptidase B. [...] Both C3a and C5a have anaphylatoxin activity, directly triggering degranulation of mast cells as well as increasing vascular permeability and smooth muscle contraction. C5b initiates the membrane attack pathway, which results in the membrane attack complex (MAC), consisting of C5b, C6, C7, C8, and polymeric C9. MAC is the cytolytic endproduct of the complement cascade; it forms a transmembrane channel, which causes osmotic lysis of the target cell. Kupffer cells and other macrophage cell types help clear complement-coated pathogens. [...] As part of the innate immune system, elements of the complement cascade {{can be found in}} species earlier than vertebrates; most recently in the protostome horseshoe crab species, putting the origins of the system back further than was previously thought.|$|E
2500|$|The {{conversion}} of dissolved carbon dioxide to gaseous carbon dioxide forms rapidly expanding gas bubbles in the soda, which pushes the beverage contents {{out of the}} container. Gasses, in general, are more soluble in liquids at elevated pressures. Carbonated sodas contain elevated levels of carbon dioxide under pressure. The solution becomes supersaturated with carbon dioxide when the bottle is opened, and the pressure is released. Under these conditions, carbon dioxide begins to precipitate from solution, forming gas bubbles. Normally, this process is relatively slow, because the activation energy for this process is high. The activation energy for a process like bubble nucleation depends on where the bubble forms. It is highest for bubbles that form in the liquid itself (homogeneous nucleation), and lower if the bubble forms on some other surface (heterogeneous nucleation). When the pressure is released from a soda bottle, the bubbles tend to form {{on the sides of}} the bottle. But because they are smooth and clean, the activation energy is still relatively high, and the process is slow. The addition of other nucleation sites provides an <b>alternative</b> <b>pathway</b> for the reaction to occur with lower activation energy, much like a catalyst. For instance dropping grains of salt or sand into the solution lowers the activation energy, and increases the rate of carbon dioxide precipitation. The physical characteristics of Mentos (surface roughness, easy dissolution into the liquid, etc.) have the effect of drastically reducing the activation energy for carbon dioxide bubble formation, so that the nucleation rate becomes exceedingly high. The activation energy for the release of carbon dioxide from Diet Coke by addition of Mentos has been found to be 25 kJ mol−1. This formation of gaseous carbon dioxide within the water, which due to hydrogen bonding and its high surface tension wants to maintain a connected matrix of molecules, causes the water to foam, ultimately generating the [...] "jet"—or [...] "geyser"—or eruption-like nature of the effusion. The foaming is aided by the presence of chemicals like potassium benzoate and aspartame in Diet Coke, and gelatin and gum arabic in the Mentos candy, all which influence the nature of water's surface tension and degree to which it can foam.|$|E

We used <b>alternative</b> <b>pathways</b> for the excretion of waste nitrogen as substitutes for the defective ureagenic pathways in 26 infants. These pathways involve synthesis and excretion of hippurate after sodium benzoate administration, and of citrulline and argininosuccinate after arginine supplementation.

40|$|Living cells keep {{sensing the}} changes in their environments, mostly, via cell surface receptors for {{different}} ligands. Attachment-dependent cells are sensitive to alterations in extracellular matrix (ECM). ECM is not only required for cell survival, but also prerequisite for epidermal growth factor (EGF) to stimulate cell proliferation. The receptors {{for the majority of}} ECM components are integrins and the receptor for EGF is EGF receptor (EGFR). When bound by their ligands, integrins and EGFR induce signal transduction cascades composed of <b>alternative</b> <b>pathways.</b> A quantitative assessment of relative contributions of <b>alternative</b> <b>pathways</b> to one final cell signaling will help understand designing principles of the network. Unfortunately, a methodology for such assessment is still not available, partly because of lack of relatively mature mathematical models. On the other hand, in most biochemical cascades, existence of <b>alternative</b> <b>pathways</b> increases the complexity and thus the robustness of networks. The relationships between the topology and robustness of large-scale biochemical networks have been studied intensively recently. In small-scale networks, while feedback has been revealed as an important contributor for adaptation and robustness, the quantitative correlation between the topology/pathway redundancy of small networks and their robustness remains unknown. In this thesis, apoptosis of bovine mammary gland epithelial cells was demonstrated to be induced when fibronectin, one of the major components of ECM, was degraded by overexpressed tPA via two potential ways: deprivation of attachment and the effects of fibronectin fragments. Secondly, a mathematical model for EGFR activation of the MAPK cascade, in which <b>alternative</b> <b>pathways</b> exist, was explored and {{it was found that the}} Shc-dependent pathway is both redundant and dominant. We hypothesize that the Shc-dependent pathway is important for EGFR to compete with other receptors, which need Shc to transduce cell signals; and this pathway is not aimed to increase the robustness of the EGFR cascade. Finally, for the general importance of <b>alternative</b> <b>pathways</b> to the network topology and robustness, several concepts have been proposed to decompose and quantitatively characterize the networks.
