50|$|The {{most often}} used Dutch {{sanction}} is the fine. The fine’s popularity stems from the 1983 Financial Penalties Act (FPA), which stresses {{the use of the}} fine over that of incarceration. Dutch courts imposed the fine in 51,280 cases, representing approximately one-third of all sanctions. Section 24 of the FPA stresses that a court should consider an offender’s ability to pay {{and the nature of the}} crime when deciding on an appropriate amount of the fine. Despite the fine’s popularity in the Dutch system, a substantial number of fines go unpaid every year. Similarly, transactions play a large role in the sentencing protocol of the Netherlands. A transaction is a sanction whereby the offender is required to pay a fine or assume certain financial conditions. Transactions are popular in the Netherlands because they provide an <b>alternative</b> <b>sanction</b> to punish offenders without congesting the jails. Specifically, transactions permit an offender to pay a fine to avoid further prosecution. Prosecutors have tremendous discretion to dispose of crimes through the use of transactions. However, transactions can only be offered in cases where the maximum statutory prison sentence is less than six years. Approximately 90% of crimes can be appropriately disposed of via a transaction. Yet, in practice, roughly 30% of all cases are settled through the use of a transaction, with prosecutorial guidelines established to minimize arbitrariness. Transactions provide an opportunity for offenders to forgo the stigmatization that results from the more traditional disposition of cases. Critics however allege that transactions coerce the arrested to forgo the procedural safeguards required by trials. As a result, they contend arrested individuals may plead to crimes they did not commit because the risk of conviction outweighs the transaction fee.|$|E
50|$|Just after John Fielding {{death in}} 1780 {{the crisis of}} the {{administration}} of criminal law renewed itself primarily due to three different factors: the first was the rise in crime rates due {{to the end of a}} period of war (in this case the American revolution) and the consequent return in the country of many soldiers and sailors who now were out of a job. The second factor was directly linked to the first and concerned the issue of transportation; transportation to the American colonies had been established in 1718 and it began the principal sanction imposed on convicted felons. The loss of the American territories, resulted in convicts piling up in inadequate jails and continuing to be sentenced to transportation even without an actual destination, therefore the government was forced to find an alternative destination for convicts sentenced to transportation or an <b>alternative</b> <b>sanction.</b> The third factor concerned the events that took place in London in June 1780, known as the Gordon riots, during which the authorities lost control of the streets of the city. These events highlighted the weakness of London policing and magisterial system.The government responded by establishing the Home Department in 1782, therefore allowing the administration of criminal law to receive more focussed attention than before. In time, this office would provide a center where all the aspects of criminal administration could be dealt with. One of the main initiatives supported by the Home Department, as well as generously funded by them, was the introduction of an armed and salaried foot patrol during the winter of 1782-83, initiated by Sampson Wright, John Fielding's successor as chief magistrate, as a means of countering highway robberies, that was to become an established element of London policing in the 1780s. The government provided funds to support 46 men who worked in eight groups of six; each of the groups was assigned to one of the major routes around the metropolis and went out every night of the week.|$|E

40|$|Resumé/Summary: This thesis {{deals with}} {{alternatives}} to unconditional prison sentences and procedural law alternatives {{in the field}} of criminal law. The introduction outlines the historical development of alternative sanctions and the reasons for their creation and implementation. The following chapters address alternative sentences as accounted for in the valid and effective Czech legislation. The community service sentence, as the most typical alternative punishment, is discussed in detail. Attention is also focused on suspended sentences, including suspended sentences with supervision, i. e. punishments which are definitely the ones that are imposed the most frequently in the Czech Republic. The sentence of pecuniary penalty, which is also often imposed as an <b>alternative</b> <b>sanction,</b> is dealt with thoroughly too. Other punishments, including forfeiture of an item, prohibition of a specific activity, prohibition of residence and deportation, whose alternative function is rather secondary, are paid less attention. The following part of the paper provides a comparison of alternative sentences according to Slovak legal regulations with alternative penalties envisaged by Czech legislation. In view of the recent amendment to substantive criminal law in the Czech Republic (Act No. 40 / 2009 Coll.), this chapter also [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedRates {{of illegal immigration}} recidivism by previously convicted and removed noncitizens—criminal immigration recidivists—are disconcerting. Enforcement strategies such as prosecution and removals {{do not appear to}} prevent and deter this population’s reoffending behavior as much as expected. Meanwhile, resources are continually strained—at the taxpayers’ expense—due to re-enforcement of immigration, criminal, and other laws. As a result, this thesis argues in favor of introducing civil restitution (CR) as an enforcement strategy against criminal immigration recidivism. In support of this argument, the author employed a hybrid experimental and causal design methodology to research the history of restitution as an <b>alternative</b> <b>sanction</b> in the criminal justice system. The feasibility of developing a strategy against criminal immigration recidivism modeled after restitution’s theoretical underpinnings was explored and tested. The CR strategy borrows from restitution’s focus on holding offenders accountable for the financial losses their offenses have caused to their victims, and, as per the research findings, its potential to lower recidivism rates, thereby reducing the costs of re-enforcing or reinitiating the removal process at the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) expense. The thesis concludes by recommending the implementation of a CR policy model strategy. The strategy will become part of the DHS Mission 3 ’s prevention of unlawful immigration goals and objectives.

They have accomplished these expatriations, and the resulting {{millions of dollars of}} annual tax savings, merely by changing the place of incorporation of their corporate parent, without the need to make any substantive changes to their business operations or their U.

Furthermore, the article offers guidelines for the development and further implementation of this measure in the Republic of Croatia.

40|$|Courts may impose {{non-monetary}} {{sanctions on}} lawyers in litigation. These commonly include what this article characterizes as <b>alternative</b> <b>sanctions</b> because they differ from traditional non-monetary sanctions that affect a lawyer’s ability to litigate a case, such as revoking the lawyer’s pro hac vice admission. <b>Alternative</b> <b>sanctions</b> may further {{be categorized as}} reflective sanctions where {{they are intended to}} cause the offending lawyers to reflect on their conduct with a goal of reform, or as shaming sanctions where they are intended to shame errant lawyers into improving their behavior and, in addition, to deter similar misconduct by other lawyers. Ordering a lawyer to attend a CLE course is the most common reflective sanction. This sanction requires no public acknowledgement of error by the lawyer. At the same time, judges who order lawyers to attend CLE programs {{do not believe that the}} lawyers will change their behaviors or improve their practices solely as a result of the content delivered during those seminars. Rather, self-analysis by the lawyer of the need to change her behavior or enhance her professional knowledge or skills is a principal goal of mandatory CLE attendance. Shaming sanctions include a demonstration of penitence by the errant lawyers. The sanction famously imposed by an Iowa federal court in 2014 in Security National Bank of Sioux City v. Abbott Laboratories is now the leading example of a shaming sanction. In that case, the district court ordered a partner from a global law firm who engaged in serious deposition misconduct to make a video presentation on appropriate deposition objections and conduct, and distribute the video to other lawyers in her firm for viewing. Although the Eighth Circuit reversed the district court on due process grounds, it did not reject the use of shaming sanctions. In fact, is important for trial courts to have sanctioning options apart from monetary sanctions and non-monetary sanctions that go to the merits or substance of the case, or to the offending lawyer’s ability to practice. The availability of <b>alternative</b> <b>sanctions</b> may be especially important where an errant lawyer’s practice is so thin that she cannot afford reasonable monetary sanctions or, at the other extreme, where the misbehaving lawyer’s wealth makes a monetary sanction proportionate to the misconduct at issue the equivalent of pocket change. This article uses the district court and Eighth Circuit decisions in the Security National Bank of Sioux City case as a framework for discussing and analyzing <b>alternative</b> <b>sanctions</b> in litigation. The article concludes that courts considering <b>alternative</b> <b>sanctions</b> should be sure to give lawyers particularized notice of the sanctions they are considering and afford the targeted lawyers an opportunity to be heard on the issue. They should also act promptly upon learning of misconduct by lawyers. Assuming they do these things, any <b>alternative</b> <b>sanctions</b> they impose are likely to be upheld on appeal in light of the deferential abuse of discretion standard of review that appellate courts apply in sanctions cases...|$|R

40|$|Ranking Correctional Punishments is the {{culmination}} of a comprehensive and methodical analysis of a series of empirical studies undertaken by the authors over the past decade with convicted offenders, criminal justice practi-tioners and the public, to elicit their views on the relative severity of correctional punishments. Taken together, the authors present, rank and analyse the ‘punishment exchange rates ’ across these interest groups. In so doing, they challenge the concept of a continuum of corrections, as proposed by Morris and Tonry (1990) in Between Prison and Probation which, as the title suggests, places prisons and probation at opposing ends of a continuum of sanction severity. Essentially, the exchange rate refers to the amount in months of an alternative sanc-tion that the offender, or other stakeholders, would endure to avoid a specified length of actual imprisonment. Thus, the exchange rate is the punishment equiva-lency between imprisonment and the <b>alternative</b> <b>sanction</b> in question. As the authors point out, the idea that people hold different views about the severity of various forms of punishments is not itself new; debates on the issue manifest in various guises in prison cells, public houses, government offices, judicial cloisters and academic circles, with various justifications being forwarded and explored. What is perhaps new, as Michael Tonry points out in the foreword, is May and Wood’s commitment to systematically eliciting and comparing the views of different interest groups on the severity or punitiveness of different correctional sanctions, as well as their ensuing findings, which, amongst others provide evidence of racial and gender differences in punishment exchange rates. May andWood provide a transparent account of the methodology underpinning their empirical enquiries in Chapter 2, and the survey instrument they developed in consultation with offenders with experience of multiple correctional punishments is contained in the appendices. Chapters 3 – 6 examine the punishment exchange rates among their sample populations; Chapter 3 is based on the views of male and female prisoners in Oklahoma and Chapter 4 on the views of Indiana probationer...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{significant}} U. S. prison population build-up over the past several decades, a large number of inmates are now being released from prison and returned to the community. One mechanism for facilitating this transition to the community is for inmates to be conditionally released under parole supervision. Once on parole, a parolee is subject to certain rules and conditions that, if violated, can result in a return to prison, even if not a criminal act. These types of non-criminal parole violations are typically referred to as Technical Parole Violations (TPVs). Many states return a large number of TPVs to prison each year, and TPVs contribute significantly to the prison population in many states. However, there is virtually no existing research examining what impact returning TPVs to imprisonment has on their subsequent rates of re-offending. While a large body of literature examining the overall impact of incarceration on recidivism has mostly concluded that imprisonment has a null or even slightly criminogenic effect, this overall finding is not necessarily generalizable to all sub-populations within the prison population. Strong theoretical cases can be made each way, for the impact on recidivism of incarcerating TPVs. This dissertation examines the impact on recidivism of sanctioning TPVs to imprisonment versus an <b>alternative</b> <b>sanction,</b> and also examines the dose-response impact on recidivism of varying lengths of stay in prison for a TPV, using a large sample of TPVs in one state (Pennsylvania). The bulk of the evidence supports the conclusion that recidivism rates are mostly lowered by using incarceration in response to first TPV violations. However, the evidence also suggests that the specific mechanism for lowering recidivism rates among incarcerated TPVs is largely attributable to aging and exposure time rather than to deterrence. The findings on the dose-response impact of differential lengths of stay in prison for TPVs who are sanctioned to imprisonment are more mixed. Generally the evidence suggests somewhat lowered recidivism rates attributable to longer lengths of stay in prison for a TPV violation, yet the effect sizes are generally smaller and in some cases statistically insignificant. It again appears that the particular mechanism for reduced recidivism rates associated with longer lengths of stay in prison is associated with aging and exposure time rather than with traditionally formulated deterrence mechanisms. A few contingencies of these findings are noted. First, the effect of imprisonment on recidivism among TPVs is likely highly contingent upon the swiftness, certainty, and perceived fairness of sanctioning, yet measures of these factors were not available for this study. Second, this dissertation only focuses on the first TPV violation instance after release from prison, and also is mostly limited to higher risk TPVs. Third, lower overall recidivism rates for TPVs sanctioned to imprisonment, and sanctioned {{for longer periods of time}} in prison, were influenced heavily by lower re-incarceration rates, whereas re-arrest rates did not significantly differ in any of the models. Since re-incarceration rates not only include new criminal activity but also new technical violations, it is unclear whether imprisonment for a first TPV reduces serious criminal behavior or rather mostly reduces additional technical violations and minor crimes. Future research must address these contingencies...|$|E
