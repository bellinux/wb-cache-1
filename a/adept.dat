5|$|For {{much of the}} game, {{the player}} {{controls}} four characters: Felix is an eighteen-year-old Venus <b>Adept</b> {{from the village of}} Vale, who was an anti-hero in Golden Sun but serves as the game's new protagonist. His younger sister, Jenna, a seventeen-year-old Mars <b>Adept</b> also from Vale, and a fourteen-year-old girl and Jupiter <b>Adept</b> named Sheba, as well as a sharp-witted elderly scholar named Kraden, are all hostages that Felix was forced to take with his now-deceased masters, the Mars <b>Adept</b> warriors Saturos and Menardi that served as the previous game's antagonists. In this game, the player takes the role of Felix as he strives to complete Saturos and Menardi's original objective to restore Alchemy to the world of Weyard, and joining them early on is a Mercury <b>Adept</b> named Piers, a mysterious young man whose ship Felix's party uses to explore the world throughout their journey.|$|E

5|$|Several {{groups of}} {{characters}} serve as Felix's antagonists in The Lost Age. He {{is at odds}} with the heroes of the original Golden Sun, led by the young Venus <b>Adept</b> warrior Isaac, who pursue him across the World, Weyard under the belief that Alchemy would potentially destroy Weyard if unleashed. One of Saturos' original companions, a powerful and enigmatic Mercury <b>Adept</b> named Alex, allies himself with a second pair of powerful and imposing Mars <b>Adept</b> warriors, Karst and Agatio. They keep the pressure on Felix to ensure he proceeds with his quest as he is supposed to.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} text's from the school's Louguan period is called the Xishengjing (The Scripture of Western Ascension). This text describes Laozi's emigration to India and the transmission of the Daode Jing to Yin Xi. However, the text is not really a narrative, but uses the stories as a framework to describe how an <b>adept</b> should live his life. The text describes how an <b>adept</b> can make use of the Dao that is inherent in the world, outlines meditation techniques, and discusses the results of living a sagely life and what happens after death.|$|E

5000|$|Players {{can start}} off as mundanes, Avatars, or <b>Adepts.</b> The {{benefit of the}} latter two is that one finds {{themselves}} in tune with some mystic force, and are most likely clued in to the Occult Underground. An Avatar is a person that channels an [...] "Archetype", a powerful and universal role in culture. Examples include the mystic hermaphrodite, the hunter, and the demagogue. <b>Adepts</b> have spells related to certain obsessions, and must power themselves with related activities. However, playing mundanes also has its advantages as one can spend their points on aspects other than an Avatar's or <b>Adept's</b> power.|$|R

5|$|Isaac and Garet pursue Saturos' {{group to}} the Mercury Lighthouse, joined by Ivan and Mia. Despite their best efforts, they fail to prevent Saturos from {{activating}} Mercury Lighthouse with the Mercury Star. Saturos' group leaves for the next Lighthouse with Isaac's party remaining in pursuit. In the ensuing chase, Isaac learns that Saturos has taken another <b>Adept</b> hostage: the female Jupiter <b>Adept,</b> Sheba. Saturos and Menardi activate the Venus Lighthouse with the Venus Star, and are confronted by Isaac's party immediately thereafter. Attempting to annihilate their opponents, Saturos and Menardi magically merge to form a massive two-headed dragon, but Isaac's party slay Saturos and Menardi. Directly following this, Sheba falls from the lighthouse and Felix proceeds to jump out after her. The remnants of Saturos' group (unbeknownst to the players until Golden Sun: The Lost Age), headed by Felix and Alex, continue their quest to light the remaining two Lighthouses, with Jenna, Sheba, and Kraden still with them. The game ends as Isaac's party boards a ship and sail out into Weyard's open seas to continue their mission.|$|E
