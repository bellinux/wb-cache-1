5|$|In some church {{records the}} town is {{referred}} to as 'Norton Canonicorum' as an alternative to Midsomer Norton, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> because of the local Priory's link to Merton Priory in London until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1546.|$|E
5|$|A neutron {{spectrometer}} {{on board the}} Lunar Prospector spacecraft detected enhanced concentrations of hydrogen close to {{the northern and southern}} lunar poles, including the crater Shackleton. At the end of this mission in July 1999, the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater Shoemaker in the hope of detecting from Earth-based telescopes an impact-generated plume containing water vapor. The impact event did not produce any detectable water vapor, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> an indication that the hydrogen is not in the form of hydrated minerals, or that the impact site did not contain any ice. Alternatively, {{it is possible that the}} crash did not excavate deeply enough into the regolith to liberate significant quantities of water vapor.|$|E
5|$|Corals are {{collected}} for the aquarium trade, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> done with little {{care for the}} long-term survival of the reef. Fishing among reefs is difficult and trawling does much mechanical damage. In {{some parts of the}} world explosives are used to dislodge fish from reefs, and cyanide may be used for the same purpose; both practices not only kill reef inhabitants indiscriminately but also kill or damage the corals, sometimes stressing them so much that they expel their zooxanthellae and become bleached.|$|E

5|$|Epilepsy surgery may be {{an option}} for people with focal {{seizures}} that remain a problem despite other treatments. These other treatments include at least a trial {{of two or three}} medications. The goal of surgery is total control of seizures <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> achieved in 60–70% of cases. Common procedures include cutting out the hippocampus via an anterior temporal lobe resection, removal of tumors, and removing parts of the neocortex. Some procedures such as a corpus callosotomy are attempted in an effort to decrease the number of seizures rather than cure the condition. Following surgery, medications may be slowly withdrawn in many cases.|$|E
5|$|House {{prices in}} Arbroath {{are very close}} to the {{national}} average and in April–June 2006 were £99 below the national average, local prices averaging £113,646 compared to the national average of £113,745. The average house price across Angus has risen by 14.9% in the past year (to November 2006) and now stands at £124,451. Angus Council suggests the recent upgrading of the A92 between Arbroath and Dundee to dual carriageway has lured Dundonians to Arbroath <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> driving up house prices.|$|E
5|$|In {{civilian}} operations, {{police forces}} keep police diving units to perform {{search and rescue}} operations, and to recover evidence. In some cases diver rescue teams may also {{be part of a}} fire department, paramedical service or lifeguard unit, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> classed as public safety diving. There are also professional divers such as underwater photographers and videographers, who record the underwater world, and scientific divers in fields of study which involve the underwater environment, including marine biologists, geologists, hydrologists, oceanographers and underwater archaeologists.|$|E

5|$|Measurements of {{the motion}} of intracluster {{planetary}} nebulae between M87 and M86 suggest that these two galaxies are moving toward each other <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> their first encounter. M87 may have encountered M84 in the past, {{as evidenced by the}} truncation of the outer halo of the former from tidal effects. However, another possible cause of this truncation is a contraction due to an unseen mass falling into M87 {{from the rest of the}} cluster, which, in particular, may be the hypothesized dark matter. A third possibility is that the halo formation was truncated as a result of early feedback from the active galactic nucleus at the core of M87.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bivalves}} are filter feeders, {{using their}} gills to capture particulate food such as phytoplankton from the water. The protobranchs feed {{in a different}} way, scraping detritus from the seabed, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> the original mode of feeding used by all bivalves before the gills became adapted for filter feeding. These primitive bivalves {{hold on to the}} substratum with a pair of tentacles {{at the edge of the}} mouth, each of which has a single palp, or flap. The tentacles are covered in mucus, which traps the food, and cilia, which transport the particles back to the palps. These then sort the particles, rejecting those that are unsuitable or too large to digest, and conveying others to the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Tarariki {{are found}} in the east of the North Island from East Cape to the Wairarapa. Māori valued the narrow spiky leaves as a source of {{particularly}} tough, durable fibre. Tarariki's strong leaf fibres may be an adaptation to the region's hot, dry summers. In parts of the Wairarapa, the trees are particularly spiky, with stiff leaves and partially rolled leaf-blades. The trees near East Cape, by contrast, have leaves that hang laxly on the tree. In Hawke's Bay, some trees have greener, broader leaves, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> because of wharanui characteristics brought in across the main divide through the Manawatu Gorge.|$|E

30|$|Release of CC from NE {{formulations}} was faster at Smix concentration {{percent lower}} than 36 % <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> attributed {{to the fact that}} the high Smix concentration may lead to sequestration of the drug into the surfactant micelles or emulsified cinnamon oil droplets and delay the release of the drug via the dialysis bag (Sainsbury et al. 2014).|$|R
5|$|The urine of many rodents (e.g. voles, degus, mice, rats) {{strongly}} reflects UV light <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> used {{in communication}} by leaving visible {{as well as}} olfactory markings. However, the amount of UV that is reflected decreases with time, which in some circumstances can be disadvantageous; the common kestrel can distinguish between old and fresh rodent trails and has greater success hunting over more recently marked routes.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Æthelberht's influence in other kingdoms was enough for him to convert any other kings to Christianity, although this is partly {{due to the lack of}} sources—nothing is known of Sussex's history, for example, for almost all of the seventh and eighth centuries. Æthelberht was able to arrange a meeting in 602 in the Severn valley, on the northwestern borders of Wessex, however, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> an indication of the extent of his influence in the west. No evidence survives showing Kentish domination of Mercia, but it is known that Mercia was independent of Northumbria, so it is quite plausible that it was under Kentish overlordship.|$|E
5|$|Siward can {{be found}} {{witnessing}} numerous charters during Edward's reign, though not as many as the Godwinsons; Siward usually comes third in lists of earls, behind Godwine and Leofric but ahead of Godwine's sons and the other earls. He witnessed at least seven, possibly nine, extant charters in 1044, six or seven in 1045, two in 1046, one in 1048 and one in 1049. A Dux ("earl") named Sihroþ and Sihroð witnessed two charters in 1050, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> Siward. There is another attestation in 1050, and his name appears in two dubious witness lists attached to charters dating to 1052 and 1054. Possibly Siward's last historical appearance in English legal documents is in the agreement made—probably at Lincoln—between Wulfwig, Bishop of Dorchester, and Earl Leofric, dating to between 1053 and 1055.|$|E

25|$|For low temperatures, {{junctions}} can be brazed or soldered, {{however it}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{difficult to find}} a suitable flux <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> suitable at the sensing junction due to the solder's low melting point.|$|R

25|$|Social {{conditions}} such as poverty, social isolation and inability to get or prepare preferred foods can cause unintentional weight loss, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> particularly common in older people. Nutrient intake can also be affected by culture, family and belief systems. Ill-fitting dentures and other dental or oral health problems can also affect adequacy of nutrition.|$|E
25|$|Half Caste, the 1859 Grand National winner, {{was painted}} by Henry Barraud later that year. No {{publicly}} available image of this painting {{has been found}} but a contemporary image of Half Caste with Green up is held by one of Christopher Green's descendants <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> based on this. The original was sold by Sotheby's, London on 18 July 1979.|$|E
25|$|Many dog breeds have underbite, {{particularly}} those with short faces, like shih tzus <b>and</b> boxers. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> due, {{as in the}} case of bulldogs, to a slower growing maxilla in relation to the mandible.|$|R

25|$|Restrictions {{were placed}} on the use of {{internal}} bank concentration accounts because such accounts do not provide an effective audit trail for transactions, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> used to facilitate money laundering. Financial institutions are prohibited from allowing clients to specifically direct them to move funds into, out of, or through a concentration account, and they are also prohibited from informing their clients about the existence of such accounts. Financial institutions are not allowed to provide any information to clients that may identify such internal accounts.|$|E
25|$|The {{algorithm}} {{is named after}} Robert W. Floyd, who was credited with its invention by Donald Knuth. However, the algorithm {{does not appear in}} Floyd's published work, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a misattribution: Floyd describes algorithms for listing all simple cycles in a directed graph in a 1967 paper, but this paper does not describe the cycle-finding problem in functional graphs {{that is the subject of}} this article. In fact, Knuth's statement (in 1969), attributing it to Floyd, without citation, is the first known appearance in print, and it thus may be a folk theorem, not attributable to a single individual.|$|E
25|$|After Frederick's death, Nattrass {{soon became}} Mary Ann's lodger. She gained {{employment}} as nurse to an excise officer recovering from smallpox, John Quick-Manning. Soon {{she became pregnant}} by him with her thirteenth child. It {{may well be that}} the name of the excise man was in fact Richard Quick Mann as {{there appears to be no}} trace of a John Quick-Manning in the records of the West Auckland Brewery or the National Archives. The census records, birth, death and marriage records also show no trace of him. Richard Quick Mann was a custom and excise man specialising in breweries and has been found in the records <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> the real name of Mary Ann Cotton's alleged lover.|$|E
30|$|In summary, {{these data}} suggest that sodium hydrosulfide {{pretreatment}} could improve heat tolerance of maize seedlings in a concentration-dependent manner <b>and</b> <b>this</b> improvement <b>may</b> <b>be</b> involved in trehalose accumulation by activating TPP activity.|$|R
30|$|Radiographers {{weighted}} {{radiation dose}} {{as more important}} than radiologists <b>and</b> clinicians. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{explained by the fact}} that radiographers in their education and daily work are more closely engaged in the physical and radiation-related aspects of radiology.|$|R
