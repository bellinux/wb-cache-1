25|$|All Medicare Advantage {{plans are}} {{required}} to limit out-of-pocket (OOP) spending by a beneficiary for Parts A and B {{to no more than}} $6,700 (as of 2016) per year for in-network providers. The OOP limit may be higher for out of network providers in a PPO; out of network providers are typically not permitted in <b>an</b> <b>HMO.</b> The average OOP limit in 2016 is around $5000. Note that an OOP limit is not a deductible as is often reported; it is instead a very valuable financial-protection benefit although is very rare that a Medicare Advantage beneficiary spends anywhere near the amount of his or her annual OOP limit. Original Medicare provides no similar OOP spending cap and the exposure of an Original Medicare beneficiary to a financial catastrophe is unlimited (but equally rare). Once the OOP maximum is reached for an individual, the plan will pay 100% of medical services {{for the remainder of the}} calendar year, with no lifetime maximum. This OOP limit does not apply to a Part C plan's Part-D-like self-administered drug coverage (which has its own different means of addressing catastrophic costs).|$|E

2500|$|Multispecialty groups, {{composed}} of physicians from clinical specialties {{as well as}} radiology and pathology, are another practice model. In some case, these may be large groups controlled by <b>an</b> <b>HMO</b> or other large health care organization. In others, they are in essence clinician group practices that employ pathologists to provide diagnostic services for the group.

Proposed changes to Medicare regulations may essentially eliminate these arrangements in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} using such a plan, unlike <b>an</b> <b>HMO</b> plan, {{which has a}} copayment cost share feature (a nominal payment {{generally}} paid {{at the time of}} service), a PPO generally does not have a copayment but offers a deductible and a coinsurance feature. The deductible must be paid in full before any benefits are provided. After the deductible is met, the coinsurance benefits apply. If the PPO plan is an 80% coinsurance plan with a $1,000 deductible, the patient pays 100% of the allowed provider fee up to $1,000. The insurer will pay 80% of the other fees, and the patient will pay the remaining 20%. [...] Charges above the allowed amount are not payable by the patient or insurer but written off as a discount by the physician.|$|E

Purpose – Previous {{research}} has established {{that there is}} a relationship between housing and mental health, however, understanding about how and why housing affects mental health is still limited. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to address this deficit by focusing on the experiences of residents of houses in multiple occupation (HMOs). Design/methodology/approach – Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 20 HMO residents who were asked about their housing career and experience of living in <b>a</b> <b>HMO.</b> Participants were recruited with assistance from community organisations and landlords. Findings – The physical properties and social environment of the property, as well as personal circumstances experienced prior to the move into the property, all influenced how mental health was affected. The authors identify and discuss in detail three key meditating factors: safety, control and identity which may affect how living in the property impacts the mental health of tenants. Practical implications – Good property management can lessen the potential harmful effects of living in <b>a</b> <b>HMO.</b> However, poorly run properties which house numerous vulnerable people may increase the risk of poor mental health due to attendant high levels of stress and possible risk of abuse. Originality/value – Based on the reports of HMO residents, the authors outline the key mediating processes through which living in HMOs may affect mental wellbeing, as well as illuminating the potential risks and benefits of <b>HMOs,</b> <b>an</b> overlooked tenure in housing research...|$|R

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, there is {{evidence}} that sicker people and people with higher medical expenditures are more likely to disenroll from Medicare Advantage plans and go back into Original Medicare [...] which could be due to the more restricted networks of health providers in <b>an</b> <b>HMO</b> or to other aspects of the benefit design of Medicare Advantage plans. This is particularly true of people in institutionalized custodial care because a large percentage of this group also qualifies for Medicaid and {{there is no need to}} have both a Part C plan and Medicaid, both of which are essentially supplements to Original Medicare. The Part C risk adjusted payments to Medicare Advantage plans described above are designed to limit this churn between types of Medicare (managed vs. FFS), but it is unclear how effective that policy is.|$|E
2500|$|They are {{licensed}} at {{the state}} level, under a license that {{is known as a}} certificate of authority (COA), rather than under an insurance license. In 1972, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners adopted the HMO Model Act, which was intended to provide a model regulatory structure for states to use in authorizing the establishment of HMOs and in monitoring their operations. In practice, <b>an</b> <b>HMO</b> is a coordinated delivery system that combines both the financing and the delivery of health care for enrollees. In the design of the plan, each member is assigned a [...] "gatekeeper", a primary care physician (PCP) responsible for the overall care of members assigned. Specialty services require a specific referral from the PCP to the specialist. Non-emergency hospital admissions also require specific pre-authorization by the PCP. Typically, services are not covered if performed by a provider not an employee of or specifically approved by the HMO unless it defines the situation to be an emergency.|$|E
2500|$|Original [...] "fee-for-service" [...] Medicare Parts A and B have a {{standard}} benefit package that covers medically necessary care {{as described in}} the sections above that members can receive from nearly any hospital or doctor in the country (if that doctor or hospital accepts Medicare). Original Medicare beneficiaries who choose to enroll in a Part C Medicare Advantage health plan instead give up none of their rights as an Original Medicare beneficiary, receive the same standard benefits—as a minimum—as provided in Original Medicare, and get an annual out of pocket (OOP) upper spending limit not included in Original Medicare. However they must typically use only a select network of providers except in emergencies, typically restricted to the area surrounding their legal residence (which can vary from tens to over 100 miles depending on county). Most Part C plans are traditional health maintenance organizations (HMOs) that require the patient to have a primary care physician, though a few are preferred provider organizations (which typically means the provider restrictions are not as confining as with <b>an</b> <b>HMO).</b>|$|E
