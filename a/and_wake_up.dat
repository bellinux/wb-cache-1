5|$|In Part 2, Phoebe {{tries to}} contact someone by phone to warn them about Rachel, {{eventually}} getting through to Joey {{at the hotel}} and stirring up homesickness in him. At the rehearsal dinner, Ross introduces his parents, Jack and Judy (Elliott Gould and Christina Pickles) to Emily's, Steven and Andrea (Tom Conti and Jennifer Saunders). Jack and Judy have volunteered to pay for half of the wedding expenses but when they discover extravagant costs Ross spends much of the evening trying to bargain down his future in-laws.

She and Chandler console each other over alcohol <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> in bed together the next morning.

As Ross says his vows, he accidentally says Rachel's name rather than Emily's, registrar to ask Emily if he should continue, while the camera shoots from character to character, settling on a shocked Rachel.|$|E

25|$|Modern humans {{often find}} {{themselves}} desynchronized from their internal circadian clock, due {{to the requirements of}} work (especially night shifts), long-distance travel, and the influence of universal indoor lighting. Even if they have sleep debt, or feel sleepy, people can have difficulty staying asleep at the peak of their circadian cycle. Conversely they can have difficulty waking up in the trough of the cycle. A healthy young adult entrained to the sun will (during most of the year) fall asleep a few hours after sunset, experience body temperature minimum at 6AM, <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> a few hours after sunrise.|$|E

They realize that only one team is active at a time, while the rest are kept asleep in the pods. Sean reveals Zero's true identity: he is Delta, an elderly man thought to be wheelchair-bound, deaf, blind and mute, who had been with Q-Team the entire time, but off-camera from the player's perspective. He admits that he killed Mira, and prevents the participants from escaping by using his esper abilities to make Eric shoot everyone but Diana.|$|E

He met his wife in New Orleans while {{coaching}} at Tulane. A teetotaler, Shaughnessy held a negative opinion of both drinkers and smokers. Marchmont Schwartz noted, [...] "When he said, 'Let's go have a drink,' he meant, 'Let's go drink a milk shake...He disappointed a lot of newspapermen that way." [...] Aside from his declared hobby as a football coach and experimenter, he enjoyed long-distance driving. Shaughnessy preferred to devise plays late at night, between midnight and dawn, while his household slept. A 1977 Sports Illustrated article described him as an [...] "ascetic" [...] and his lifestyle as [...] "Spartan".

500|$|... "Brawl in the Family" [...] was {{directed}} by Matthew Nastuk {{and was the first}} episode Joel H. Cohen received a sole writing credit for. Cohen had previously received a credit for [...] "Hex and the City", the first segment of [...] "Treehouse of Horror XII" [...] which aired the previous year. [...] "Brawl in the Family" [...] originally aired on January 6, 2002 on the Fox network. It was the first episode for which current showrunner Al Jean served as sole showrunner. It was the second of his episodes to air however, since the Christmas-themed [...] "She of Little Faith", the second episode he produced, was chosen to air first as it would coincide with the holiday. The idea for the episode was pitched by Jean, who wanted to make a follow-up to the season 10 episode [...] "Viva Ned Flanders". In it, Homer takes Ned to Las Vegas to teach him how to have fun.

500|$|Commentators {{around the}} world sought to {{interpret}} {{the relationship between the}} Na'vi and humans in the film, mostly agreeing with Maxim Osipov, who wrote in the Hindustan Times and The Sydney Morning Herald: [...] "The 'civilised humans' turn out as primitive, jaded and increasingly greedy, cynical, and brutal—traits only amplified by their machinery—while the 'monkey aliens' emerge as noble, kind, wise, sensitive and humane. We, along with the Avatar hero, are now faced with an uncomfortable yet irresistible choice between the two races and the two worldviews." [...] Osipov wrote that it was inevitable that the audience, like the film's hero, Jake, would find that the Na'vi's culture was really the more civilized of the two, exemplifying [...] "the qualities of kindness, gratitude, regard for the elder, self-sacrifice, respect for all life and ultimately humble dependence on a higher intelligence behind nature." [...] Echoing this analysis, psychologist Jeffery Fine in The Miami Herald urged [...] "every man, woman and child" [...] to see the film <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> to its message by making the right choice between commercial materialism, which is [...] "steamrolling our soul and consciousness", and reconnection with all life as [...] "the only... promise of survival" [...] for humanity. [...] Similarly, an Angolan critic saw the film as a message of hope, writing, [...] "With this union of humans and aliens comes a feeling that something better exists in the universe: the respect for life." [...] Cameron confirmed that [...] "the Na'vi represent the better aspects of human nature, and the human characters in the film demonstrate the more venal aspects of human nature." ...|$|E

500|$|Wilt Chamberlain was {{the first}} big earner of basketball: {{immediately}} becoming the highest paid player upon entering the NBA, Chamberlain was basketball's first player to earn at least $100,000 a year, and earned an unprecedented $1.5 million during his Lakers years. As a Philadelphia 76er, he could afford to rent a New York apartment and commute to Philadelphia. In addition, he would often stay out {{late into the night}} <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> at noon, a point that became notorious in the 1965–66 NBA season. When he became a Laker, Chamberlain built a million-dollar mansion he called the [...] "Ursa Major" [...] in Bel-Air, as a play on his nickname [...] "The Big Dipper". It had a 2,200-pound pivot as a front door and contained great displays of luxury. [...] Robert Allen Cherry, journalist and author of the biography , describes his house as a miniature Playboy Mansion, where he regularly held parties and lived out his later-notorious sex life. This was also helped by the fact that Chamberlain was a near-insomniac who often simply skipped sleeping. Designed according to his preferences, the house was constructed with no right angles, and had an [...] "X-rated" [...] room with mirrored walls and a fur-covered waterbed. Chamberlain lived alone, relying on a great deal of automated gadgets, with two cats named Zip and Zap and several Great Dane dogs as company. In addition, Chamberlain drove a Ferrari, a Bentley, and had a Le Mans-style car called Searcher One designed and built at a cost of $750,000 in 1996. Following his death, in 1999 Chamberlain's estate was valued at $25 million.|$|E
