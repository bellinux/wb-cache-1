5|$|The Nuttalliellidae can be {{distinguished}} from both ixodid and argasid ticks {{by a combination of}} a projecting capitulum at the front <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft,</b> leathery skin. Other distinguish characteristics include the position of the stigmata, the lack of setae, the strongly corrugated integument, and the form of the fenestrated plates.|$|E
5|$|The {{children}} {{spent the}} morning in the resort's Kids' Club, then the family lunched at their apartment before heading to the pool. Kate took the last known photograph of Madeleine at 2:29 that afternoon, sitting by the pool next to her father and two-year-old sister. The children returned to Kids' Club, and at 18:00 their mother took them back to 5A, while their father went for a tennis lesson. The McCanns put the children to bed around 19:00. Madeleine was left asleep in short-sleeved, pink-and-white Marks and Spencer's Eeyore pyjamas, next to her comfort blanket <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> toy, Cuddle Cat.|$|E

5|$|The {{project was}} {{originally}} planned {{to begin in}} 2012 with the ride opening in 2013, but it was delayed by one year. Construction began in 2013 with a scheduled opening date of May 1, 2014; however, the opening was delayed due to mechanical and technical issues. Following a preview opening to park employees in early August <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> opening on August 16, 2014, Falcon's Fury officially {{opened to the public}} on September 2, 2014. Public response to the ride has been positive, praising the height of the tower and the drop experience.|$|E
5|$|In March 1989, {{the first}} buses {{were tested in}} the tunnel; University Street station was only 75 percent complete, and buses had to drive under {{scaffolding}} and construction equipment while passing through the station. Tunnel construction was completed in June 1990, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> opening for University Street station was held on August 9, 1990. Bus service in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel began on September 15, 1990, with several Metro bus routes moved into the tunnel from surface streets. All service on routes using the tunnel was operated by dual-mode buses, which operated as diesel buses outside the tunnel and electrically, as trolleybuses, when inside the tunnel. During its early months, University Street and other stations were affected by serious water leaks, which splashed water onto walkways during the tunnel's first winter in operation. The leaks were later fixed by Metro contractors.|$|E
5|$|The soft fins, skin, and {{musculature}} of {{the false}} catshark suggest a sluggish lifestyle. An enormous oil-filled liver makes up 18–25% of its total weight, allowing it to maintain near-neutral buoyancy and hover off the bottom with little effort. This species likely captures prey via quick bursts of speed, with its large mouth allowing it to consume food of considerable size. It feeds mainly on bony fishes such as cutthroat eels, grenadiers, and snake mackerel, and also takes lanternsharks, squids, octopodes, and Heterocarpus shrimp. It likely also scavenges, as examination of stomach contents have found surface-dwelling fishes such as frigate mackerel, needlefishes, and pufferfishes. One specimen caught off the Canary Islands had swallowed human garbage, including potatoes, a pear, a plastic bag, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> drink can. There is a record of a false catshark found with bite marks from a great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias).|$|E

5|$|X-Men: First Class (stylized onscreen as X: First Class) is a 2011 American superhero film, {{based on}} the X-Men {{characters}} appearing in Marvel Comics. It is the fifth installment in the X-Men film series. It is both a prequel <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> reboot of the franchise, the film was directed by Matthew Vaughn and produced by Bryan Singer. The story is set primarily in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and focuses {{on the relationship between}} Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto (Michael Fassbender), and the origin of their groups—the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants, respectively, as they deal with the Hellfire Club led by Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), who is bent on world domination. The film co-stars Rose Byrne, January Jones and Oliver Platt. The film also introduces new actors to the series including Nicholas Hoult and Jennifer Lawrence who, like McAvoy and Fassbender, reimagine popular characters from the franchise (Beast and Mystique) that have already been established in previous films, namely the original trilogy.|$|E

25|$|The Toller was bred to {{retrieve}} from icy waters {{and must have}} a water-repellent double coat of medium length and softness, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> dense undercoat. The coat may have a slight wave on the back, but is otherwise straight. Some winter coats may form a long loose curl at the throat. Featherings are soft and moderate in length, the tail is well feathered and held jauntily when the dog is excited or moving.. The hair on the muzzle is short and fine. Seasonal shedding is to be expected.|$|E
25|$|The {{leadership}} was divided {{on how to}} respond to the movement as early as mid-April. After Zhao Ziyang's return from North Korea, the divisions intensified. Those who supported continued dialogue <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> approach with students rallied behind Zhao Ziyang, while hardliner conservatives who opposed the movement rallied behind Premier Li Peng. Zhao and Li clashed at a PSC meeting on 1 May. Li maintained that the need for stability overrides all else, while Zhao said that the party should show support for increased democracy and transparency. Zhao pushed the case for further dialogue.|$|E
25|$|The {{accessories}} {{for the two}} styles {{depended on}} the intended use of the coat: for more formal settings, the outfit might still have striped trousers and demand a top hat and white gloves; for business, {{by the turn of}} the century, the morning coat was used (again, this referred to a single breasted frock coat then, not the modern morning coat). This last was accompanied by a business collar (such as winged collar, not a standing Imperial collar); a four in hand tie (as opposed to the formal cravat and puff), <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> Derby or Homburg.|$|E

25|$|The {{drug policy}} of the Netherlands is marked by its {{distinguishing}} between so called soft and hard drugs. An often used argument is that alcohol, which is claimed by some scientists as a hard drug, is legal <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> drug can't be more dangerous to society if it's controlled. This may refer to the Prohibition in the 1920s, when the U.S. government decided to ban all alcohol. Prohibition created a golden opportunity for organized crime syndicates to smuggle alcohol, {{and as a result}} the syndicates were able to gain considerable power in some major cities.|$|E
25|$|The pavlova has a {{crisp and}} crunchy outer shell, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft,</b> moist marshmallow-like centre, in {{contrast}} to meringue which is usually solid throughout. It has been suggested the addition of cornflour {{is responsible for the}} marshmallow centre, although it has been debated that the cornflour is just another egg white stabiliser in addition to the acid. The consistency also makes the pavlova significantly more fragile than meringue. Because the pavlova is notorious for deflating if exposed to cold air, when cooking is complete it is left in the oven to fully cool down before the oven door is opened.|$|E
25|$|The most {{frequently}} used meat is pork, followed by beef, lamb, chicken, rabbit, duck and goose; for immediate consumption it is often grilled, or dusted with breadcrumbs and sauteed, in a dish similar to schnitzel. For bigger gatherings, oven roasts are prepared. The need for meat preservation no longer presents the urgency that it did during the Soviet occupation or previous times of trouble, but many favorite techniques survive, include brining, salting, drying and smoking. There are many varieties of smoked pork, including ham <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> sausage with a large-grained filling; these are served as a main course or thinly sliced in sandwiches.|$|E

40|$|The {{emission}} of an edge dislocation from a thin-film-covered crack is studied {{in order to}} investigate {{the effects of a}} passive film on stress-corrosion cracking. The results show that the crack stress field in the film due to the applied loads is enhanced by a harder film or abated by <b>a</b> <b>softer</b> film. For <b>an</b> edge dislocation in the film, both the slip component of the image force and the shielding effect are stronger when the film is harder. Under pure mode II or III loadings a harder thin film makes the dislocation emission easier <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>softer</b> film makes the dislocation emission more difficult if the film thickness is smaller than a critical value. The opposite is also true if the film thickness is larger than the critical value. Under pure mode I loadings, however, a harder thin film makes the dislocation emission more difficult <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>softer</b> film makes the dislocation emission easier for the two film thicknesses used in this study...|$|R

25|$|Refreshment outlets {{include a}} snack bar {{run by the}} Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation (TTDC), an ice cream parlour <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> drinks counter—all near the entrance. The park also {{maintains}} 16 toilets and nearly two dozen drinking fountains within the premises for the visitors. The zoo is open to public from 8:30 am to 5:30 pm except on Tuesdays, when the zoo carries out weekly maintenance works. All the animals, especially the big cats, are back in their cages after 5.00 pm and most tourists prefer to visit them before going on to the other exhibits. The zoo has a guest house located on Kelambakkam Road.|$|E
25|$|Laughton's voice, equally {{capable of}} a penetrating, theater-filling shout <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft,</b> velvety tone, first {{appeared}} on 78-rpm records {{with the release of}} five British Regal Zonophone 10-inch discs entitled Voice of the Stars issued annually from 1934 to 1938. These featured short soundtrack snippets from the year's top films. He is heard on all five records in, respectively, The Private Life of Henry VIII, The Barretts of Wimpole Street, Mutiny on the Bounty, I, Claudius (curiously, since this film was unfinished and thus never released), and Vessel of Wrath. In 1937 he recorded Lincoln's Gettysburg Address on a 10-inch Columbia 78, having made a strong impression with it in Ruggles of Red Gap.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{negative}} pressure mechanical ventilators {{are still in}} use, notably with the polio wing hospitals in England such as St Thomas' Hospital in London and the John Radcliffe in Oxford. The prominent device used is a smaller device known as the cuirass. The cuirass is a shell-like unit, creating {{negative pressure}} only to the chest {{using a combination of}} a fitting shell <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> bladder. Its main use is in patients with neuromuscular disorders that have some residual muscular function. However, it was prone to falling off and caused severe chafing and skin damage and was not used as a long-term device. In recent years this device has re-surfaced as a modern polycarbonate shell with multiple seals and a high-pressure oscillation pump in order to carry out biphasic cuirass ventilation.|$|E
