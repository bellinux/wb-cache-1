5|$|Jennings began {{singing and}} playing on <b>a</b> <b>Nylon</b> string guitar {{at the age}} of ten, Then at 12 years of age Jennings auditioned for a spot on KVOW in Littlefield, Texas. Owner J.B. McShan, along with Emil Macha, {{recorded}} Jennings's performance. McShan liked his style and hired him for a weekly 30-minute program. Following this successful introduction, Jennings formed his own band. He asked Macha to play bass for him, and gathered other friends and acquaintances to form The Texas Longhorns. The style of the band, a mixture of Country and Western and Bluegrass music, was often not well received.|$|E

25|$|In 1975 {{a team of}} Japanese {{scientists}} studying ponds containing {{waste water}} from <b>a</b> <b>nylon</b> factory, discovered a strain of Flavobacterium that digested certain byproducts of nylon 6 manufacture, such as the linear dimer of 6-aminohexanoate. Nylon 4 or polybutyrolactam can be degraded by the (ND-10 and ND-11) strands of Pseudomonas sp. found in sludge. This produced γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a byproduct.|$|E
25|$|Equipment {{is carried}} by {{officers}} in <b>a</b> <b>nylon</b> equipment belt, {{also known as}} a gun or weapon belt. The nylon belt, specifically designed to be very light-weight, was first issued in 2003 as a replacement for worn leather belts. The belt consists of one firearm holster placed on the hip (either side), one firearm magazine pouch, one ASP (baton) pouch, one OC Spray pouch, one hand cuff pouch and one holder for the portable radio.|$|E
25|$|An {{effective}} and relatively cheap method {{to prevent the}} transmission of cholera {{is the use of}} a folded sari (a long cloth garment) to filter drinking water. In Bangladesh this practice was found to decrease rates of cholera by nearly half. It involves folding a sari four to eight times. Between uses the cloth should be rinsed in clean water and dried in the sun to kill any bacteria on it. <b>A</b> <b>nylon</b> cloth appears to work as well but is not as affordable.|$|E

50|$|Typical {{applications}} for liquid silicone rubber are products that require high precision such as seals, sealing membranes, electric connectors, multi-pin connectors, infant products where smooth surfaces are desired, such as bottle nipples, medical applications {{as well as}} kitchen goods such as baking pans, spatulas, etc. Often, silicone rubber is overmolded onto other parts made of different plastics. For example, a silicone button face might be overmolded onto <b>an</b> <b>Nylon</b> 6,6 housing.|$|R

25|$|At small strains, elastin confers {{stiffness}} to {{the tissue}} and stores {{most of the}} strain energy. The collagen fibers are comparatively inextensible and are usually loose (wavy, crimped). With increasing tissue deformation the collagen is gradually stretched {{in the direction of}} deformation. When taut, these fibers produce a strong growth in tissue stiffness. The composite behavior is analogous to <b>a</b> <b>nylon</b> stocking, whose rubber band does the role of elastin as the nylon does the role of collagen. In soft tissues the collagen limits the deformation and protects the tissues from injury.|$|E
25|$|Around 2007, a {{new type}} of strings were {{produced}} made of mostly <b>a</b> <b>nylon</b> core coiled with nylon like the metal-nylon strings, possibly in imitation of Western catgut strings. The sound is similar to the metal-nylon strings but without the metallic tone to them (one of the main reasons why traditionalists do not like the metal-nylon strings). The nylon strings are able to be turned to standard pitch without breaking and can sustain their tuning whatever the climate unlike silk. The strings have various names in China but they are advertised as sounding like silk strings prior to the 1950s when silk string production stopped.|$|E
25|$|The CSIRO disc {{permeameter}} of Perroux and White (1988) (not patented) comprises <b>a</b> <b>nylon</b> mesh supply membrane (with a {{very small}} diameter around 10–40mm), a water reservoir and a bubbling tower. The bubbling tower {{is connected to the}} reservoir and is open to air. The bubbling tower controls the potential h0 applied to the membrane by adjusting the water height in the air-inlet tube. So essentially the soil pores need to have energy equivalent to h0 to overcome water that is held under tension in the reservoir. It can be used to supply potential ranging -200mm to 0mm, effectively excluding pores with diameter bigger than 0.075mm.|$|E
5000|$|Controlled {{internal}} drug release (CIDR) {{devices are}} used in livestock for the synchronization of estrus. They are T-shaped devices with <b>a</b> silicone-coated <b>nylon</b> core. The silicone coating is impregnated with progesterone. [...] CIDRs are inserted intra-vaginally using a specialized applicator. The flexible wings collapse for facilitated insertion and expand once placed appropriately within the vagina. The expansion of the wings retains its position; CIDRs have very high retention rates that may exceed 97%. [...] <b>A</b> thin <b>nylon</b> tail remains exteriorized and is used for removal.|$|R

25|$|Albert Almoznino {{suggests}} {{to use a}} white or light-colored wall, sheet or table cloth for a small audience as in a private home. If a wall is dark-colored, the sheet or table cloth can be hung against it. If performing for a large audience such as in an auditorium or on a stage, he suggests a screen made of muslin or other thin cloth attached to a frame. In a nightclub, hall or small theater, he suggests <b>a</b> <b>nylon</b> screen on a pliable aluminum frame. It is a screen sometimes used for TV projection called a rear projection screen, but the light must be stronger like a small spotlight without the projector, lenses, or diffusers, or a motion-picture projector with the front lenses removed.|$|E
25|$|The Fulton Surface-To-Air Recovery System {{was used}} to extract {{personnel}} and materials via air. A large helium balloon raised <b>a</b> <b>nylon</b> lift line into the air, which was snagged by a large scissors-shaped yoke attached to {{the nose of the}} plane. The yoke snagged the line and released the balloon, yanking the attached cargo off the ground with a shock less than that of an opening parachute. A sky anchor secured the line and wires stretched from the nose to both leading wing tip edges protected the propellers from the line on missed snag attempts. Crew members hooked the snagged line as it trailed behind and attached it to the hydraulic winch, pulling the attached person or cargo into the plane through the rear cargo door.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} kit-drumming sticks are wooden sticks modeled on, {{or in some}} cases {{identical}} to, those originally designed for use with the snare drum. These {{come in a variety of}} weights, conventionally expressed as a number, and tip designs, expressed as a letter following the number, with the higher numbers indicating lighter sticks. Thus, a 7A is a common jazz stick with a wooden tip, while a 7N is the same weight, with <b>a</b> <b>nylon</b> tip, and a 7B is a wooden tip but with a different tip profile (shorter and rounder than a 7A). A 5A is a common wood tipped rock stick, heavier than a 7A but with a similar profile. The numbers are most commonly odd but even numbers are used occasionally, in the range 2 (heaviest) to 9 (lightest).|$|E

25|$|One {{month after}} his escape, on September 16, 1977, 60-year-old Ferne Jackson was raped, beaten, and strangled {{to death with}} <b>a</b> <b>nylon</b> {{stocking}} {{at her home in}} the Wynnton district of Columbus. Nine days later, 71-year-old Jean Dimenstein was killed similarly, as were 89-year-old Florence Scheible on October 21, and 69-year-old Martha Thurmond on October 23. Five days later, Gary struck again, raping and killing 74-year-old Kathleen Woodruff. This time there was no stocking left at the scene. Four months later on February 12, 1978, Ruth Schwob was attacked but she triggered a bedside alarm and her assailant fled. He went just two blocks down the road before breaking into another house and raping and strangling 78-year-old Mildred Borom. His final victim was 61-year-old Janet Cofer, murdered on April 20.|$|E
25|$|Since 1962 {{no fewer}} than 121 planes have crashed {{at or near the}} airport, killing a total of 19. Most {{noteworthy}} of these was on September 25, 2004 when a 1985 Stout Bushmaster 2000 (a spinoff of a Ford Tri-Motor) crashed during an airport exhibition. The plane's rudder locked to a left position during the takeoff roll, causing the plane to veer left off the runway. The pilot was able to get the plane airborne before rolling into a crowd of spectators; the plane then narrowly missed the airport's control tower, rolled hard left and crashed onto a busy thoroughfare. In all, four were injured: the 2-person flight crew and two in a moving car. The cause of the accident was due to failure of the flight crew to remove a gust lock—improvised from <b>a</b> <b>nylon</b> cargo strap—from the plane's empennage before flight.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{was driven}} to a beach cottage, where the rope around his ankles was {{loosened}} sufficiently to enable him to make steps. Ross and his partners walked him into the house, {{one of the men}} leading him on <b>a</b> <b>nylon</b> leash, another holding his handcuffs. Ross and his partners had made the house a virtual prison; the windows were covered with thick nylon straps forming a mesh, to prevent escape. The two doors to the room where he was held were guarded. His captors also took his shoes and fitted the room with motion detectors. According to Shupe and Darnell's (2006) account of court testimony, Scott demanded that he be allowed to leave, and asked Ross whether he would try to make him change his religious beliefs. Ross was said to have replied that that was what he was paid to do. When Scott threatened Ross with criminal prosecution, Ross was said to have threatened Scott that he would handcuff him to the bed frame.|$|E
25|$|Since the 20th century, nylon {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{materials}} for the construction of carpets. Both nylon 6 and nylon 6-6 are used. Nylon can be dyed topically or dyed in a molten state (solution dying). Nylon can be printed easily and has excellent wear characteristics. Due to nylon's excellent wear-resistance, it is widely used in industrial and commercial carpeting. In carpets, nylon tends to stain easily because of the dye sites which exist on the fibre. These dye sites need to be filled in order to give nylon carpet any type of stain resistance. <b>As</b> <b>nylon</b> is petroleum-based it varies in price with the price of oil.|$|R

25|$|On 6 November 1990, Chikatilo {{killed and}} {{mutilated}} a 22-year-old woman, named Svetlana Korostik, in woodland near Donleskhoz station. While leaving the crime scene, he was observed by an undercover officer. The policeman observed Chikatilo approach a well and wash {{his hands and}} face. When he approached the station, the undercover officer noted that Chikatilo's coat had grass and soil stains on the elbows. Chikatilo also had a small red smear on his cheek. To the officer, he looked suspicious. The only reason people entered woodland near the station {{at that time of}} year was to gather wild mushrooms (a popular pastime in Russia), but Chikatilo was not dressed like a typical forest scavenger; he was wearing more formal attire. Moreover, he had <b>a</b> <b>nylon</b> sports bag, which was unsuitable for carrying mushrooms. The policeman stopped Chikatilo and checked his papers, but had no formal reason to arrest him. When the policeman returned to his office, he filed a routine report, containing the name of the person he had stopped at the station.|$|E
25|$|The R33 Skyline (Spec 2) {{continued}} the concepts {{introduced in the}} R32. Driver and Passenger airbags became standard in 1996. As a result, pre-1996 models are barred from being imported into various countries for consumer road use as they {{do not meet the}} frontal impact standards. (However, in the U.S., there are Federal Laws regarding safety and emissions that require certain documents to be obtained, certain criteria to be met and adhered to, or 25 years to pass, before the sale of this vehicle becomes legal.) For the RB25DET engine the ignition system was also changed, with the ignition module no longer located on the cam covers and was instead replaced by smart ignition coils (Ignitor built into coil) and ECU. The RB25DET's turbo was also given <b>a</b> <b>nylon</b> compressor wheel to improve response. Throughout the time the R33 was produced there were quite a number of different styled lights and bodykits fitted, the actual body/chassis underwent no changes. Among the cosmetic changes in the spec 2 were, the headlights which tapered down more towards the grill and were fitted with improved reflectors, the grill (which was longer on the Spec 1), the bonnet which had a re-shaped leading edge to fit the new lights and front bumper changing shape in the smallest amount to match the lower edge of the new headlights. Later models of the Spec 2 also had the option of having an Active-LSD fitted.|$|E
