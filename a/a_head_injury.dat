40|$|The {{comprehensive}} <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> service {{run by the}} neurosurgeons at the Hull Royal Infirmary for {{the surrounding}} population of one million was analysed. The analysis showed that all patients with either a fractured skull or a lowered level of consciousness should be admitted to a district general hospital because the associated risk of their having <b>a</b> major <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> is over 20 %. Those patients with both a fractured skull and a lowered level of consciousness have a 60 % likelihood of <b>a</b> major <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> and should be transferred immediately to the neurosurgical unit. Patients with compound or complicated fractures of the skull and those without fractured skulls but with neurological impairment persisting for four hours or more, should also {{be transferred to the}} neurosurgical unit. If these guidelines are followed about 200 patients/million population will be referred to the neurosurgical centre. Patients with <b>a</b> minor <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> and none of the clinical risk factors may safely be sent home.
