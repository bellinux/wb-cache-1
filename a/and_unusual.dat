5|$|Asser's prose {{style has}} been criticised for weak syntax, stylistic pretensions, and garbled exposition.

5|$|Despite its radical <b>and</b> <b>unusual</b> shape, the {{airframe}} {{was built}} along traditional lines. Except {{for the most}} highly stressed parts, the whole structure was manufactured from standard grades of light alloy.

5|$|Lethal {{injection}} {{was proposed}} and adopted {{on the grounds}} it was more humane than the methods of execution {{in place at the}} time, such as the electric chair and gas chamber. Opponents of lethal injection reject this argument, noting multiple cases where executions have been either painful, prolonged, or both. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, lethal injections have the highest rate of botched executions of any method used in the US, with 7.12% of executions using this method between 1982 and 2010 considered to have not gone according to plan. A study published in The Lancet in 2005 found that in 43% of cases of lethal injection, the blood level of hypnotics was insufficient to guarantee unconsciousness. However, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled 7–2 in 2008 (Baze v. Rees) and 5–4 in 2015 (Glossip v. Gross) that lethal injection does not constitute cruel <b>and</b> <b>unusual</b> punishment.|$|E
