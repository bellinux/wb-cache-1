40|$|Academic {{discussion}} {{continues as}} to whether a fleet of grid-connected wind farms, widely dispersed across a single grid network, can provide a reliable electricity supply. One opinion is that wide geographical dispersion of wind farms provides sufficient smoothing of the intermittent and highly variable output of individual wind farms enabling the wind <b>farm</b> <b>fleet</b> to provide for base load demand. In {{an examination of the}} 5 -minute time-averaged wind farm operational data for 21 large wind farms connected to the eastern Australian grid- geographically the largest, most widely dispersed, single interconnected grid in the world (AER, [1]) - this paper challenges that opinion. The findings also suggest that the connection of such a wind <b>farm</b> <b>fleet,</b> even one that is widely dispersed, poses significant security and reliability concerns to the eastern Australian grid. These findings have similar implications for the impact of wind farms on the security of electricity grids worldwide...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. This paper investigates how number and {{location}} of solar installations may reduce aggregate irradiance variability and therefore lessen the overall impact of PV on grid distribution. The current distribution of UK solar farms is analysed. It was found that variability is linked to site clustering and nearness to coast. The UK solar <b>farm</b> <b>fleet</b> currently comprises a range of system sizes which, when viewed in en masse, reduces variation in PV generation...|$|R

50|$|William Bomgaars was an {{entrepreneur}} who went from operating a general store in Middleburg, Iowa, to buying a Ford Model A {{and becoming a}} salesman for Bowes Seal Fast. He eventually moved his business to Sioux City and became a jobber for NAPA Auto Parts in 1946. In 1952, he and four other men formed a buying group and Bomgaars entered the <b>farm</b> <b>fleet</b> business. By 2001, the company had 15 stores; it nearly doubled the chain's size by acquiring 13 former Country General stores after that chain's owner filed for bankruptcy. In 2012 Bomgaars acquired five Shoppers Supply stores in Iowa. In 2015, Bomgaars took over 12 former locations of the defunct ALCO Stores chain.|$|R
50|$|It {{deviates}} to {{the east}} from Fleet Haven and passes {{to the west of}} (another) Red House <b>Farm</b> then rejoins <b>Fleet</b> Haven just south of Wards <b>Farm.</b> <b>Fleet</b> Haven runs out of land and meets the sea wall. In the parish, and close {{to the east}} is the base of RAF Holbeach which is accessed via Durham's Road. The parish extends out on the mud flats along Fleet Haven Outfall. To access the part of the parish along the start of The Wash would be extremely foolish and is out of bounds due to the bombing range. The limit of the parish finishes between Gat Sea End and Old South Middle. There are observation towers on the sea wall for the bombing range. The control tower is on the sea wall towards Dawsmere and Gedney Drove End. Dawsmere Creek extends out towards The Wash. The boundary with Lutton is along Boatmere Creek then extends out to sea along Tycho Wing's Channel, which is the outflow of the River Nene. This area is the far west of The Wash NNR.|$|R
50|$|Middle Hill is a {{hill in the}} British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar. It {{is located}} at the {{northern}} end of the Upper Rock Nature Reserve. It figured prominently in the early history of the 1704 siege of Gibraltar by the Spanish and French. The artillery battery at Middle Hill had been constructed by 1727 and was active for more than two centuries. In the mid twentieth century, Middle Hill transitioned to use as an <b>aerial</b> <b>farm</b> for the Ministry of Defence. The radio farm was refurbished in 1958. About 1970, the Princess Caroline's Battery Group of Barbary macaques were moved to Middle Hill, where they were provisioned at a group of derelict buildings that were part of the battery complex. In 2005, much of Middle Hill was transferred from the Ministry of Defence to the Government of Gibraltar, and is now managed by the Gibraltar Ornithological and Natural History Society.|$|R
50|$|Middle Hill Battery is an {{artillery}} battery in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar. It {{is located on}} Middle Hill, at the northeastern end of the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, just south of Green's Lodge Battery and Rock Gun Battery. The emplacement dates to 1727, when a single gun was mounted. By {{the turn of the}} twentieth century, six 10-inch rifled muzzle-loading guns were present at Middle Hill Battery. Other buildings documented at that time as part of the battery complex included the Nursery Hut (barrack accommodation) and the Middle Hill Group, the latter a cluster of buildings which perched on the cliff edge. An anti-aircraft Bofors gun had been installed at the battery by the Second World War. After the war, the area transitioned to use as a Ministry of Defence <b>aerial</b> <b>farm.</b> In 2005, the battery and surrounding area were transferred to the Government of Gibraltar. The site is now managed by the Gibraltar Ornithological and Natural History Society.|$|R
50|$|In 1949 the Air Ministry bought {{land from}} Balliol College, Oxford to create RAF Greatworth, {{which was an}} RAF radio {{communications}} station from early in the 1950s until 1988. In 1973 the station had a selection of high frequency (HF) radio transmitters, including the Marconi HS31 (6 kW), HS51 (30 kW), HS71 (12 kW) and the Marconi MST (Marconi Self Tuner) 1200 (30 kW). There was also a selection of Racal Speedrace transmitters, one of which offered remote control of frequency and aerial parameters from Systems Control. The <b>aerial</b> <b>farm</b> had steerable log periodic antennae, dipoles, rhombics and bicones - all types of HF antenna. A 24-hour watch system, each consisting of an RAF sergeant, a junior technician (JT), a senior aircraftman (SAC) and a civilian radio technician was maintained which carried out preventive and corrective maintenance and also re-tuned the transmitters and their drive units as directed by Systems Control at RAF Stanbridge in Bedfordshire.|$|R
5000|$|During the war {{the head}} office and drawing office {{were at a}} big old house on the {{outskirts}} of Thurmaston called [...] "The Woodlands". The fuselages and wings were manufactured at Syston under the works manager by the name of Sharp. Sheet metalwork was done at the old 'en tout cas' works at Thurmaston. Final assembly, fitting out and testing took place at Rearsby aerodrome. The name changed to Auster (after the Roman name for the south wind) on 7 March 1946, when production shifted to Rearsby aerodrome, all in Leicestershire. All designs were evolved from the early Taylorcraft with a sprung skid or tailwheel beneath the fin (except for a low-wing aircraft called the [...] "Agricola" [...] designed for <b>aerial</b> <b>farming</b> work; only nine of these were completed). When the company was merged into Beagle Aircraft in June, 1961, the high-wing design was developed still further as the Terrier and, with a nosewheel, the Airedale.|$|R
50|$|An upgrade {{in early}} March 2012 {{streamlined}} the channel's {{presentation to the}} station's HD upgrade. Mills <b>Fleet</b> <b>Farm</b> began to sponsor Stormcenter 2 and 24/7.

50|$|Rock Gun Battery is an {{artillery}} battery in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar. It {{is located on}} the North Face of the Rock of Gibraltar at the northern end of the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, above Green's Lodge Battery. The emplacement on Middle Hill is at the northern summit of the Rock. It was constructed during the Great Siege of Gibraltar, due to its advantageous position and the success of the gun at Green's Lodge Battery. It was used effectively during the Great Siege and was rebuilt during the Second World War. During the mid-twentieth century, the Ministry of Defence began to use the site as an <b>aerial</b> <b>farm,</b> which was then refurbished in 1958. The Rock Gun Battery and the Middle Hill Battery were closed to the public for decades. In 2005, the radio farm was closed and the Ministry of Defence withdrew from most of the area, transferring it to the Government of Gibraltar. However, the summit, the site of the Rock Gun Battery, continues to be under MOD authority.|$|R
