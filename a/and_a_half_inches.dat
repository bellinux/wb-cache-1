5|$|The main conning {{tower was}} {{protected}} by 12 inches of armour on its sides {{and it had a}} 4-inch roof. The aft conning tower (sometimes called the torpedo control tower) had 9-inch sides and a 3-inch roof. The communications tube down from each position was 6 inches thick above the upper deck and 2 inches thick below it. Each magazine {{was protected by}} two armour plates on each side as torpedo bulkheads, the first one an inch thick and the second one <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>inches</b> thick.|$|E
25|$|In {{the center}} of the medal, a bronze cross pattée, one <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>inches</b> wide, are crossed anchors from the pre-1850 period, with cables attached. The letters USN are evident amid the anchors.|$|E
25|$|The {{one story}} gray {{structure}} is sixteen feet wide by fourteen feet deep. It has a gable roof and deeply pointed, rough-cut, fieldstone piers. The structure is sheathed in weatherboards {{of about five}} <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>inches.</b> They are covered by a clipped-corner wood shingle roof. The west and south entrances have four panel doors. The north side {{does not have any}} openings. The sash windows are 6/6 double hanging.|$|E
5000|$|The South American palm weevil, Rhynchophorus palmarum, is {{a species}} of snout beetle. The adults are {{relatively}} large black beetles of approximately one <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>inch</b> in length, <b>and</b> the larvae may grow to two inches in length.|$|R
50|$|The Leanders relied for {{protection}} on sub-division, coal bunkers, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> one <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>inch</b> (40mm) armoured deck over 165 feet amidships. The armoured deck was {{just above the}} normal waterline at the centre, and sloped down at the sides to protect against shells entering at the waterline.|$|R
2500|$|Police Fire Marshall Patrick Keady interviewed sixty-two people {{directly}} {{connected with}} {{the fire in the}} week following the blaze and delivered his report on December 18, 1876. He had been forcibly struck by the lack of use of water in any form of conveyance, though <b>a</b> two <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>inch</b> (...) pipe serviced the hydrant near the stage.|$|R
25|$|The unknown man had {{a slender}} build, short grey hair, and {{appeared}} to be in his late 50s or early 60s. He stood five feet and ten <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>inches</b> tall with blue eyes and a tan complexion. From witness reports, the man was of Germanic descent and spoke with a thick German accent. He was neatly groomed; his face was shaven and his hair was clean and combed.|$|E
25|$|The {{pins and}} balls {{are known as}} the 'Kit' and the balls should be made of Wood, Tufnol or Rubber and 'must not exceed five and a quarter inches in {{diameter}} and no less than four and three quarter inches in diameter'. Despite guidelines for the diamond and balls there is no uniform size of pin needing only 'to be uniform size and painted white, one <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>inches</b> around the top.|$|E
25|$|The {{right arm}} {{was over the}} belly, {{the back of the}} hand and wrist had on it clotted blood. The legs were drawn up with the feet close to the wall. The body and face were warm and the hand cold. The legs were quite warm. Deceased had a silk {{handkerchief}} round her neck, and it appeared to be slightly torn. I have since ascertained it was cut. This corresponded with the right angle of the jaw. The throat was deeply gashed and there was an abrasion of the skin about one <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>inches</b> in diameter, apparently stained with blood, under her right arm.|$|E
50|$|The five <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>inch</b> plastic Kubotan {{key chain}} is Kubota's most {{important}} invention. It {{was designed as}} a tool for female Los Angeles Police Department officers, and registered as trademark in 1978. Kubota also developed the Kubotai, another self-defense weapon, which was patented in 1991. The Kubotai is used to employ wrist locks and immobilize the opponent.|$|R

50|$|Gourdine {{graduated}} from Brooklyn Technical High School and studied at Cornell University, where he {{competed in the}} sprints, hurdles and long jump, and was selected {{for membership in the}} Quill and Dagger society. At the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki he won a silver medal for the long jump, one <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>inch</b> short of Jerome Biffle's golden medal jump.|$|R
25|$|The medal is a {{modified}} cross pattée one <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>inches</b> wide. The ends of its arms are rounded whereas a conventional cross patée has arms that are straight on the end. There are four laurel leaves with berries {{in each of}} the re-entrant arms of the cross. In the center of the cross a sailing vessel is depicted on waves, sailing to the viewer's left. The vessel is a symbolic caravel of the type used between 1480 and 1500. Fraser selected the caravel because it was a symbol often used by the Naval Academy and because it represented both naval service and the tradition of the sea. The laurel leaves with berries refer to achievement.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{clear-cut}} incision on the neck. It was six {{inches in length}} and commenced two <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>inches</b> {{in a straight line}} below the angle of the jaw, one half inch in over an undivided muscle, and then becoming deeper, dividing the sheath. The cut was very clean and deviated only a little downwards. The arteries and other vessels contained in the sheath were all cut through. The cut through the tissues on the right side was more superficial, and tailed off to about two inches below the right angle of the jaw. The deep vessels on that side were uninjured. From this it was evident that the hemorrhage was caused through the partial severance of the left cartoid artery.|$|E
25|$|Steel wolf traps, used {{frequently}} in the American west, were made from heavy steel, were six <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>inches</b> wide, and had two springs, each with 100lbs of power. Steel wolf traps were usually the same models used in the capture of beavers, lynx and wolverine. In order to hide the human scent, trappers would handle their equipment with gloves, and cover the traps in beeswax or blood. As the wolf's power of scent is so great, a mere touch of human skin on the trap {{will result in the}} wolf vacating the area. Wolves may also dig up or spring the traps. The traps would typically be set in fours around a bait and strongly fastened to concealed logs, and covered in moss, chaff, cotton or sand for camouflage. Sometimes, the trap and the bait would be placed in a pool of water, thus leaving no other point of access for the wolf to take.|$|E

50|$|In March 2008, Broussard {{was allowed}} to attend LSU's pro day in {{preparation}} for the 2008 NFL draft. He ran a 4.75-second 40-yard dash, did 21 bench press repetitions, <b>and</b> had <b>a</b> 28 <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>inch</b> vertical jump. He was not drafted and did not play professionally. He returned to his hometown Lafayette, where he lives as of 2016 with his daughter and fiancee.|$|R
50|$|Initially just 4 {{miles of}} the one foot eleven <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>inch</b> gauge was {{established}} at Nocton... on the heavy fenland east of Wasp's Nest. After 1926, the narrow gauge line was greatly extended in order {{that it could be}} connected to the railhead on the Lincoln to Sleaford mainline. The weight of the line at Nocton, because of the intensive use of locomotives, was 20lb per yard.|$|R
25|$|He had {{his first}} {{achievements}} in the shot put while at Douglas Road Elementary School in Burnaby, winning the school title at age eleven. At Burnaby South Secondary School he established himself as one of Canada's best young throwers by setting national age-group record in the shot put. Steen grew to be a tall man, at six-foot and four <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>inches,</b> and as his physique developed he reached a weight of 235 pounds. He went on to study at the University of Oregon, where he {{became part of the}} Oregon Ducks track and field led by coach Bill Bowerman. A central team member in the throw events, Steen placed fifth at the NCAA Men's Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships in 1962 and competed in the preliminaries of the discus throw. His contribution helped Oregon to the NCAA team title. The following year he had his best placing in NCAA competition, coming second in the shot put final.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, Serra {{made his}} first sculptures out of nontraditional {{materials}} such as fiberglass and rubber. Serra's earliest work was abstract and process-based made from molten lead hurled in large splashes {{against the wall of}} a studio or exhibition space. In 1967 and 1968 he compiled a list of infinitives that served as catalysts for subsequent work: “to hurl” suggested the hurling of molten lead into crevices between wall and floor; “to roll” led to the rolling of the material into dense, metal logs. He began in 1969 to be primarily concerned with the cutting, propping or stacking of lead sheets, rough timber, etc., to create structures, some very large, supported only by their own weight. His “Prop” pieces from the late 1960s are arranged so that weight and gravity balance lead rolls and sheets. Cutting Device: Base Plate Measure (1969) consists of an assemblage of heterogeneous materials (lead, wood, stone and steel) into which two parallel cuts have been made and the results strewn around in a chance configuration. In Malmo Role (1984), a four-foot-square steel plate, one <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>inches</b> thick, bisects {{a corner of the room}} and is prevented from falling by a short cylindrical prop wedged into the corner of the walls.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, the British Somaliland {{protectorate}} government commissioned {{an archaeological}} survey in twelve desert towns in present-day Somaliland, {{near the border}} with Ethiopia. According to the expedition team, the sites yielded the most salient evidence of late medieval period affluence. They contained ruins of what were evidently once large cities belonging to the Adal Sultanate. Three of the towns in particular, Abara, Gargesa and Amud, featured between 200 and 300 stone houses. The walls of certain sites still reportedly stood 18 meters high. Excavations in the area yielded 26 silver coins, unlike the copper pieces that were more common in polities below the Horn region. The earliest of these recovered coins had been minted by Sultan Barquq (1382–99), also of the Egyptian Burji dynasty, and the latest were again Sultan Qaitbay issues. All of the pieces had been struck in either Cairo or Damascus. A few gold coins were also discovered during the expedition, making the area {{the only place in}} the wider region to yield such pieces. Besides coinage, high quality porcelain was recovered from the Adal sites. The fine celadon ware was found either lying on the surface, or buried at a depth of seven <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>inches,</b> or ensconced within dense middens four to five feet high. Among the artefacts were grey granular sherds with a crackled blue-green or sea-green glaze, and white crystalline fragments with an uncrackled green-white glaze. Some Ming dynasty ware was also discovered, including many early Ming blue-and-white bowl sherds. They were adorned with tendril scrolls on a bluish ground and ornamented with black spotting, while other bowls had floral patterns outlined by grey or black-blue designs. Additionally, a few Ming red-and-white sherds were found, as well as white porcelain fragments with bluish highlights. The Adal sites appeared to reach an Indian Ocean terminus at the Sa'ad ad-Din Islands, named for Sultan Sa'ad ad-Din II of the Ifat Sultanate.|$|E
50|$|Reel {{capacity}} {{is affected by}} both the reel diameter and the reel hub diameter. The standard ten <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>inch</b> reel has approximately twice {{the capacity of the}} seven inch reel, which in turn has twice the capacity of the five inch. Some (not all) reels described as three inches are in fact three <b>and</b> <b>a</b> quarter inches in diameter, in order to have half the capacity of a five-inch reel.|$|R
2500|$|Denis Compton {{went on the}} rampage against Pakistan at Trent Bridge in 1954, making 278 {{before falling}} to 16-year-old Khalid Hasan. [...] Nineteen-year-old, 5 foot 3 <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>inch,</b> Hanif Mohammed, scored 1600 runs on the tour. [...] Fazal Mahmood bowled Pakistan to a {{stunning}} 24 win at the Oval, with 6 wickets in each innings.

50|$|Silver, {{which itself}} {{is subject to}} air, light and humidity, became the ground; liver of sulfur the {{chemical}} agent; and metal plates, wood, paper, linen, and the wall itself the various supports. The works {{range in size from}} <b>a</b> three <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>inch</b> leaf on paper to paintings five feet in height and width. The appearance and composition of these works changes over time as reactions between the materials and environment occur.|$|R
500|$|The [...] hangar-deck armour of Design X1 was a {{reduction}} from the [...] {{called for in}} the original X configuration. The waterline armour belt was also four inches thick, but only covered the central portion of the ship to form the armoured citadel. The belt was closed by [...] transverse bulkheads fore and aft. One <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>inches</b> (38mm) of armour extended [...] forward and [...] aft of the belt to protect the waterline against splinter damage.|$|E
500|$|The ship {{lacked a}} {{full-length}} waterline armor belt. The {{sides of her}} boiler and engine rooms and steering gear were protected by [...] of armor. The transverse bulkheads {{at the end of}} her machinery rooms were [...] thick forward and three inches thick aft. The conning tower and the deck over the machinery spaces and steering gear had one <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>inches</b> of armor. The gun turrets were not armored and only provided protection against muzzle blast and splinter damage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{skittles}} {{are about}} 15cm high, circular {{at the bottom}} but widening higher up then tapering to a shallow point, which leaves them slightly top heavy.

50|$|Because the {{lighthouse}} needed {{to endure the}} lake’s strong winds and heavy winter ice-floes, Dow pegged and bolted together {{the lighthouse}}’s twenty-five-foot square stone foundation, post-and-beam frame and tower, and slate and tin roof. Dow then secured the entire building with one <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>inch</b> thick iron rods to assure its stability. Despite Dow’s focus on the building’s framework, he ornamented his lighthouse with <b>a</b> mansard roof <b>and</b> scrolled window frames typical of the then-fashionable French Second Empire style. A sixth order Fresnel lens exhibited a fixed red light beginning in 1871.|$|R
50|$|The {{artificial}} ice {{was constructed}} by laying {{several layers of}} waterproof paper and wool. On top of this was built a 4-inch tall watertight pan, which held the water. In the pan were three and one-half miles of one <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>inch</b> pipe which held ammonia, cooled below the freezing point of water. The cold pipes then caused the ice to freeze. The construction of the rink had been opposed by local churches {{in the area that}} were concerned about the noise made by the crowds enjoying the facility.|$|R
