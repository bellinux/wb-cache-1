5|$|Ernest Edward Mills Joyce <b>AM</b> (<b>about</b> 1875 – 2 May 1940) was a Royal Naval seaman and {{explorer}} {{who participated}} in four Antarctic expeditions during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, early in the early 20th century. He served under both Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton. As {{a member of the}} Ross Sea party in Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, Joyce earned an Albert Medal for his actions in bringing the stricken party to safety, after a traumatic journey on the Great Ice Barrier. He was awarded the Polar Medal with four bars, one of only two men to be so honoured, the other being his contemporary, Frank Wild.|$|E
5|$|At 3 <b>a.m.</b> <b>about</b> 120 {{bank and}} trust company {{officials}} assembled {{to hear a}} full report {{on the status of}} the failing trust companies. While the Trust Company of America was barely solvent, the Lincoln Trust Company was probably $1 million short of what it needed to cover depositor accounts. As discussion ensued, the bankers realized that Morgan had locked them in the library and pocketed the key to force a solution, the sort of strong-arm tactic he had been known to use in the past. Morgan then entered the talks and advised the trust companies they must provide a loan of $25 million to save the weaker institutions. The trust presidents were still reluctant to act, but Morgan informed them that if they did not it would lead to a complete collapse of the banking system. Through his considerable influence, at about 4:45a.m. he persuaded the unofficial leader of the trust companies to sign the agreement, and the remainder of the bankers followed. Having received these commitments, Morgan allowed the bankers to go home.|$|E

25|$|About midnight, Mayor Stokes {{formally}} requested National Guard {{assistance in}} quelling the riot. More than 4,000 Guardsmen were mobilized, and 1,500 {{were sent to}} Cleveland that night.

25|$|In 1936, DNL started {{negotiations}} with Pan American Airways (Pan <b>Am)</b> <b>about</b> cooperation on the transatlantic route between Norway and the United States. DNL argued that Norway's location {{made it an}} ideal base for the European flights to North America. Pan Am would operate from New York to Reykjavík, while DNL would operate the service from Reykjavík to Bergen and onwards to various destinations in Europe. The contract was signed in March and DNL bought a Sikorsky S-43 flying boat, registered as LN-DAG and christened Valkyrien. However, after the aircraft was delivered and {{three weeks before the}} route was to be inaugurated, Pan Am changed their mind, canceled the agreement and decided that the transatlantic route should instead operate via Newfoundland to Foynes, Ireland, and via the Azores in the winter.|$|E

25|$|The {{practice}} of separating the prefix of the infinitive mode from the verb, by {{the intervention of}} an adverb, is not unfrequent among uneducated persons… I am not conscious, that any rule has been heretofore given in relation to this point… The practice, however, of not separating the particle from its verb, is so general and uniform among good authors, and the exceptions are so rare, that the rule which I <b>am</b> <b>about</b> to propose will, I believe, prove to be as accurate as most rules, and may be found beneficial to inexperienced writers. It is this :—The particle, TO, which comes before the verb in the infinitive mode, must {{not be separated from}} it by the intervention of an adverb or any other word or phrase; but the adverb should immediately precede the particle, or immediately follow the verb.|$|E
25|$|In 1936, Aerotransport and Aeroflot {{had started}} a {{cooperation}} on a route between Stockholm and Moscow, with connections from Stockholm to Siberia and Irkutsk and Vladivostok. Aerotransport wanted to connect westwards via DNL's network to Foynes, with connection to Pan Am's flights. However, the proposal was rejected by Aeroflot. The other problem was that Imperial Airways wanted to prioritize British, rather than Scandinavian, mail on west-bound flights, causing DNL to cancel their plans to connect to Ireland. In a meeting in Berlin on 10 January 1939, the four Nordic airlines agreed to let DNL continue to negotiate with Pan <b>Am</b> <b>about</b> pooling transatlantic flights, with DNL representing all four companies. Support was gained from the Nordic post companies, who would guarantee {{for the use of}} the route. DNL's Bernt Balchen went to the United States to negotiate with American authorities and suppliers to start a route.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Budan's theorem was of such great importance, the {{appearance}} of Sturm's theorem in 1827 gave it (and Vincent's theorem) the death blow. Sturm's theorem solved the real root isolation problem, by defining the precise number of real roots a polynomial has in a real open interval (a, b); moreover, Sturm himself, p.108, acknowledges the great influence Fourier's theorem had on him: « C'est en m'appuyant sur les principes qu'il a posés, et en imitant ses démonstrations, que j'ai trouvé les nouveaux théorèmes que je vais énoncer. » which translates to «It is by relying upon the principles he has laid out and by imitating his proofs that I have found the new theorems which I <b>am</b> <b>about</b> to present.» Because of the above, the theorems by Fourier and Sturm appear in almost all the books on the theory of equations and Sturm's method for computing the real roots of polynomials {{has been the only}} one widely known and used ever since – up to about 1980, when it was replaced (in almost all computer algebra systems) by methods derived from Vincent's theorem, the fastest one being the Vincent–Akritas–Strzeboński (VAS) method.|$|E
