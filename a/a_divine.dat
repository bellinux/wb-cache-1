5|$|Along with Pope Martin I, Maximus was vindicated by the Third Council of Constantinople (the Sixth Ecumenical Council, 680–681), which {{declared}} that Christ possessed both a human and <b>a</b> <b>divine</b> will.

5|$|Christologically Maximus {{insisted on}} a strict dyophysitism, which {{can be seen as}} a {{corollary}} of the emphasis on theosis. In terms of salvation, humanity is intended to be fully united with God. This is possible for Maximus because God was first fully united with humanity in the incarnation. If Christ did not become fully human (if, for example, he only had <b>a</b> <b>divine</b> and not a human will), then salvation was no longer possible, as humanity could not become fully divine.|$|E

This work marked a change in Priestley's theological thinking that is critical to understanding his later writings—it {{paved the way for}} his materialism and necessitarianism (the belief that <b>a</b> <b>divine</b> being acts in accordance with necessary metaphysical laws).|$|E

5|$|A notable {{feature on}} the wall of the front porch on the ground floor is a foot print on a stone slab.

He served in the monastery for a long time and on one fine day he announced that he had completed his service to the monastery and then stamped his left foot on the stone slab which created a dented formation of his step. This step is venerated as a miracle in view of a belief among the people of the region that such an imprint on a stone slab could only be created by <b>a</b> <b>divine</b> person who was a true devotee of the monastery.|$|E
50|$|This mystery {{deals with}} {{the future and the}} past. The magi of Time, known as Diviners, also created the Corridors, holes in time and space that take a person from one place to another. The Corridors became the main form of {{transportation}} for all magi. When the Diviners were wiped out during the Iron Wars, the Corridors were maintained by the Kan-hanar s Life while the church took control of the use of the Corridors. It is stated in Darksword Adventures that for a person to be <b>a</b> <b>Diviner,</b> one parent must also be <b>a</b> <b>Diviner.</b>|$|R

5|$|Amenhotep I was {{succeeded by}} Thutmose I, {{apparently}} a senior military figure. It is unclear {{if there was}} any blood relationship between the two, although {{it has been suggested that}} Thutmose I was a son of Amenhotep's elder brother Ahmose Sipairi. Amenhotep may have appointed Thutmose I as coregent before his own death as Thutmose I's name appears next to Amenhotep's on <b>a</b> <b>divine</b> barque found by archeologists in the fill of the third pylon at Karnak. However, most scholars consider that this is only evidence of Thutmose associating himself with his royal predecessor. One text has also been interpreted to mean that Amenhotep appointed his infant son as coregent, who then predeceased him. However, the scholarly consensus is that there is too little evidence for either coregency.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} someone {{following}} his conscience {{to the point}} of accepting the consequence of being condemned to death is Sir Thomas More (1478-1535)]]. A theologian who wrote on the distinction between the 'sense of duty' and the 'moral sense', as two aspects of conscience, and who saw the former as some feeling that can only be explained by <b>a</b> <b>divine</b> Lawgiver, was John Henry Cardinal Newman. A well known saying of him is that he would first toast on his conscience and only then on the pope, since his conscience brought him to acknowledge the authority of the pope.|$|E
5|$|Antoinism {{believes}} in a dualistic universe {{composed of a}} spiritual world governed by the law of God or consciousness, and of a corporal world, governed by natural laws, in which matter is an illusion perceived by the imagination generated by intelligence. The man combines in himself both worlds, as he has a physical body and <b>a</b> <b>divine</b> consciousness. In Antoinist views, the importance of human laws and science is weakened as they are based not on consciousness, but on intelligence. The view of the matter is, however, not considered a sin, but an error that causes suffering.|$|E
