500|$|Regarding the band's reunion, Lytle noted, [...] "The bargain I {{made myself}} {{regarding}} the 'brief reunion and couple of shows' situation was that I wasn't gonna {{talk too much}} about it. I was just gonna stew on it, and then do it. That's {{the good thing about}} festivals. No need for me to sell <b>anything</b> <b>here.</b> Get in, rock out, get paid, get out. There are just going to be a few shows. Festival-type thingies. Perhaps the odd 'warm up gig' in someone's hair salon or something. Money was a motivating factor (resurfacing my indoor tennis court, oil change for my 4×4 Ferrari) but the idea of playing and hanging out with each other is something all of the guys are pretty stoked about." ...|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club {{gave the}} album a {{positive}} review, but wrote: [...] "Flashes of brilliance aside, the result sounds {{an awful lot}} like something Yorke dashed off to pass the time before delving into the new Radiohead album." [...] Mark Beaumont of the Guardian called it [...] "deviously understated", but found that its unconventional release was [...] "more impactful than the product." [...] Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork wrote: [...] "There's precious little to grab on to in terms of melody and feeling, and you won't find yourself humming along to <b>anything</b> <b>here.</b> That said, certain elements of Tomorrow's Modern Boxes, if given the right amount of attention, can be enjoyable to luxuriate in." [...] Chris Barton of the Los Angeles Times found the album too similar to Yorke's 2006 solo album The Eraser and his work with Atoms for Peace, writing that [...] "it’s just a bit disappointing that Yorke's path seems short on new directions." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 16, 2009, a woman {{claimed to}} have {{suffered}} a head injury from riding Son of Beast during her visit to the park on May 31, 2009. She did not report the incident to Kings Island officials prior to June 16. She {{claimed to have}} suffered from a burst blood vessel in her brain, after riding Son of Beast, that required admission to an intensive care unit at a nearby hospital. [...] "The first we heard of this was on June 16. Her visit was on May 31 and there's no record of going to first aid for <b>anything</b> <b>here</b> at the park," [...] said Don Helbig, public relations manager for Kings Island. Helbig {{also pointed out that}} there were no other reports of injuries on the ride that year. The Son of Beast was shut down as a precaution, however, during the investigation. [...] "At this point it would be inappropriate to speculate on an exact date when the ride may reopen. We're going to do a thorough maintenance review. We're going to work with the state of Ohio on that," [...] said Helbig.|$|E
5000|$|Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave 2/5 (Average) for {{director}} Ramgopal Varma's Agyaat; Masand states [...] "At a {{time when}} special effects and digital tricks {{can be used to}} create just about <b>anything,</b> <b>here's</b> a reminder that what really scares us is the stuff we can't see".|$|R

2500|$|Kevin Carr {{gave the}} film {{a score of}} 3/5 saying, [...] "The filmmakers {{were just trying to}} tell a story. Sex, drugs and {{violence}} just didn't factor into that equation." [...] On the other hand, David Nusair gave the film a negative review with a score of 1.5/4 saying, [...] "...it's difficult to imagine even the most die-hard fan of musicals finding <b>anything</b> <b>here</b> worth embracing." [...] Scott Weinberg also gave the film a negative review saying, [...] "A schmaltzy little piece of obvious fluff that's directed in truly horrendous fashion and populated by cardboard characters who spit out simplistic platitudes and breathy pop tunes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{first mate}} doesn't count for <b>anything</b> <b>here.</b> This {{is a private}} camp, and if you don't behave {{yourself}} we'll pitch you out of it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{think you}} would get better much faster at home, Stephen. You cannot do <b>anything</b> useful <b>here,</b> and you cannot rest. Mr. Musgrave agrees." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't see <b>{{anything}}</b> comical--greatly--except <b>here</b> an' there. Specially {{about those}} redooced {{charges in the}} guns. Do you see anything funny in it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Master Fearing, thou didst fear [...] Thy God, and wast afraid [...] Of doing <b>anything</b> while <b>here</b> [...] That {{would have}} thee betrayed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose Covent Garden's {{still going}} strong," [...] he said. [...] "I think I miss the opera {{as much as}} <b>anything</b> <b>here.</b> Have you seen Tristan and Isolde?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Smith-Oldwick hesitated. [...] "I--well, I couldn't do <b>anything</b> <b>here</b> {{alone and}} I {{was going to}} try to get out of the city and in some way reach the British forces east and bring help." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "His own idea--entirely. And, by Jove! he {{proves to}} be right. You can't do <b>anything</b> <b>here</b> without a uniform. And they tell me he's got {{everything}} correct, down to the crest on the buttons." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{boys had}} better go below," [...] said Barwell Dawson. [...] "You can't do <b>anything</b> up <b>here,</b> {{and you may}} get a worse dose next time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Silks--satins--velvets--jewels--laces--they {{never wore}} <b>anything</b> else. <b>Here</b> {{is one of}} Jane Andrews' stories {{depicting}} her heroine as sleeping in a beautiful white satin nightdress trimmed with seed pearls." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is indeed}} a lonely spot," [...] he remarked. [...] "One can imagine <b>anything</b> {{happening}} <b>here.</b> Did I not hear of a tragedy only the other day--a man found dead?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There isn't <b>anything</b> <b>here</b> that I know of," [...] {{answered}} Ruth. [...] "In {{the summer}} time {{people come here}} to picnic. There is a nice spring {{of water in the}} center of the island." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Have I {{ever done}} <b>anything</b> <b>here?</b> Ever touched the broom, or spread the mats, or rolled them up, or found the draughts, or {{collected}} the dominoes, or {{put my hand}} {{to any kind of}} work?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't say, I'm sure," [...] she answered. [...] "I haven't seen <b>anything</b> <b>here</b> {{yet that}} reminds me of fairies, but Cap'n Bill said a {{floating}} island in the sky was sure to be a fairyland." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was looking}} for {{something}} I lost," [...] said the young oarsman. [...] "Have you seen <b>anything</b> in <b>here</b> of a flat, white package with a black shoestring tied around it?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, I {{thought maybe}} you wouldn't mind asking him. I swear to God I won't start <b>anything</b> <b>here</b> if he'll just only let me stay. I won't {{go out of the}} house if that'll suit him. It's no more'n a fortnight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The pack-mules {{will be here}} in a few moments. Don't wait {{to close}} up or put away <b>anything</b> <b>here,</b> but clap that gold in the saddle-bags, and take Barker with you and 'lite' out for Boomville AT ONCE. I will {{overtake}} you later." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are right, Louise!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "I shall {{go back to}} my {{rooms at}} once. Fortunately, I had a man {{shadowing}} Von Behrling, and there may be a report for me. If <b>anything</b> comes <b>here,</b> you will telephone at once?" ...|$|R
6000|$|STEVE. 'Can I do <b>anything?</b> See <b>here,</b> if {{the house}} is upside down and {{you would like to}} get rid of the Colonel for an hour or two, suppose he dines with me to-night? I'm dying to hear all the news of the Punjab since I left.' ...|$|R
