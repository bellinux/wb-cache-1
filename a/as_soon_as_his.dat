5|$|As {{the date}} of the {{disaster}} nears, Dilip arranges a loan for the wedding of his sister. Roy later explains how the company is ignoring safety standards, and that how a future leak might become uncontrolled as the officials had turned off safety measures to reduce the maintenance costs. Roy gives his resignation to the company and advises Dilip not to talk about the plant's safety if he wishes to retain his job. Dilip makes a phone call to Motwani describing what Roy just said, and expresses his fear about the plant's safety, saying he will return to the rickshaw-pulling business <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> sister is married.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{divided the}} Empire again in 293AD, {{appointing}} two Caesars (junior emperors) to rule over further subdivisions of East and West. Each would be subordinate {{to their respective}} Augustus (senior emperor) but would act with supreme authority in his assigned lands. This system would later be called the Tetrarchy. Diocletian's first appointee {{for the office of}} Caesar was Constantius; his second was Galerius, a native of Felix Romuliana. According to Lactantius, Galerius was a brutal, animalistic man. Although he shared the paganism of Rome's aristocracy, he seemed to them an alien figure, a semi-barbarian. On 1 March, Constantius was promoted to the office of Caesar, and dispatched to Gaul to fight the rebels Carausius and Allectus. In spite of meritocratic overtones, the Tetrarchy retained vestiges of hereditary privilege, and Constantine became the prime candidate for future appointment as Caesar <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> father took the position. Constantine went to the court of Diocletian, where he lived as his father's heir presumptive.|$|E
5|$|Diogenes {{had been}} married to an {{anonymous}} daughter of Basil Argyros, brother of Emperor Romanos III Argyros (r. 1028–1034), but in 1029 he was accused, along with other prominent Balkan generals such as Eustathios Daphnomeles, of conspiring against the emperor with the porphyrogennete princess Theodora. He was transferred east as strategos of the Thracesian Theme but, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> complicity in the affair was confirmed, was recalled to Constantinople. There he was imprisoned, beaten and publicly paraded in the Mese {{along with the other}} conspirators, and later tonsured and forced to enter the Stoudios Monastery. Theodora herself was placed in a convent, but she apparently continued to conspire with Diogenes, who planned to take advantage of Romanos's absence on campaign in the East in 1032 to escape to the Balkans. The plot was leaked to Romanos by Theophanes, metropolitan of Thessalonica, and the conspirators were arrested. Diogenes was brought to the Palace of Blachernae for interrogation by John the Orphanotrophos, but he committed suicide, throwing himself off a wall, rather than confess under torture and implicate his fellow conspirators.|$|E

5|$|McCudden set {{out across}} the English Channel. Unsure of the dispositions on the ground after the German advance he checked the {{airfield}} he suspected to be Boffles but found it empty. Flying in heavy mist he decided to head to Auxi-le-Château, France, to get directions from the RAF personnel stationed there. He approached Corporal W.H. Burdett and L. E Vallins of 52 Squadron. Burdett had served with McCudden in 3 Squadron back in 1915. Burdett did not recognise him in his flying gear. They marked his map and McCudden returned to his machine. Around 90 seconds after takeoff from Auxi-le-Château, the S.E.5a plunged into the ground. 8 Squadron's Corporal W.H. Howard was on the scene within minutes and fought through the fire to free McCudden who was lying {{next to one of}} the wings—he had not worn his safety belt. Burdett followed and recognised the pilot <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> headgear had been removed. He was taken to No. 21 Casualty clearing station and diagnosed with a fractured skull. He did not regain consciousness and died at 20:00.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of Qutayba's absence in the south, {{the inhabitants of}} Samarkand overthrew their ruler Tarkhun due to his passive stance towards the Arabs, and installed the prince Ghurak in his stead. As Qutayba prepared to march against Samarkand {{during the winter of}} 711/712, he received envoys from the king of Khwarizm (the Khwarizmshah). Khwarizm had been previously subdued in the mid-690s by Umayya ibn Abdallah, but <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> forces departed, the Khwarizmshah had renounced the treaty, and subsequent efforts by Yazid ibn al-Muhallab against Khwarizm had failed. The Khwarizmshah, whose name is given as Jigan or Chigan by Bal'ami, faced a rebellion by his younger brother Khurrazadh and a powerful rival, the king of Khamjird, and asked Qutayba for help, offering recognition of the Caliphate's suzerainty, money, livestock and the payment of tribute in exchange. Qutayba, after announcing that he would head for Sogdia, advanced with his troops in a lightning campaign to the Khwarizmian capital Hazarasp. His brother Abd al-Rahman defeated and killed Khamjird's troops in battle and took 4,000 prisoners, who were then executed. Khurrazadh and his followers were also captured and executed. The Khwarizmians however rebelled shortly after Qutayba's departure and killed the Khwarizmshah. Qutayba replaced the governor, Iyas ibn Abdallah ibn Amr, with his own brother Abdallah ibn Muslim, but the revolt persisted until, after the capture of Samarkand, a strong force under al-Mughir ibn Abdallah could be sent to subdue the region. The local Afrighid dynasty was left in place, with Askajamuk II, the son of Azkajwar II, as the new Khwarizmshah, but the conquest of Khwarizm was accompanied by great brutality: the 11th-century Khwarizmian scholar al-Biruni compares the events with a barbarian sack, as the Arabs proceeded to massacre most of the upper classes who had fomented the revolt, and destroyed a great many objects of Khwarizmian culture, including manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|VOC forces {{proceeded}} {{to clear the}} rebels from the area surrounding Surabaya. Two VOC detachments—Indonesian companies led by Dutch captains—were sent northwest along the coast, clearing the rebels in the areas surrounding Sidayu, Tuban and the Kendeng mountains with no losses. Speelman also sent envoys, including Indian traders, to Kraeng Galesong at Pasuruan. Galesong was a former ally of Trunajaya who had quarreled with him and remained neutral during the battle in Surabaya. This negotiation failed in early May, and Galesong refused to submit even after Trunajaya's defeat in Surabaya. The VOC also tried to gain the loyalties of the lords of Madura, Trunajaya's home island across the strait from Surabaya. Several Madurese lords submitted to the admiral as {{the representative of the}} Mataram king in late May, and Speelman tried to install one of them, Raden Martapati, as a proxy. However, Martapati's authority collapsed in the face of Trunajaya loyalists <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> VOC escorts left Madura, and he was forced to flee to Surabaya. Subsequently, Speelman himself sailed to Madura, defeated Trunajaya's allies there, and razed his residence, Maduretna. However, in late June the court of Mataram itself fell to Trunajaya's forces, and the king fled. Upon receiving this news, Speelman decided to sail immediately to defend the strategic point of Jepara and link up with the retreating royal forces.|$|E

25|$|The allied {{powers of}} Britain and France asked Piedmont {{to enter the}} Crimean War, {{partially}} to encourage Austria to enter, which it would not do unless it was certain that Piedmontese troops were not available to attack Austrian positions in Italy.

As a result, 2,500 Spanish cavalry charged into La Houssaye's dragoons in a great ill-formed mass.

Sadler wound up in 2nd and Sorenson in 3rd while the entire field had to pit one lap later. Earnhardt, Jr. mistakingly made his second pit stop in Lap 121 by completing his pit stop with his right front tire over the outside boundary line of his pit box, resulting in a one lap penalty.|$|E
25|$|Galileo soon heard {{reports that}} Lorini had {{obtained}} {{a copy of}} his letter to Castelli and was claiming that it contained many heresies.

As 1615 wore on he became more concerned, and eventually determined to go to Rome <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> health permitted, which it did {{at the end of the}} year.

25|$|Downriver from Kut, at Ali Gharbi, Lieutenant-General Fenton Aylmer was {{collecting}} {{forces to}} relieve the Kut garrison.

Setting out on 4 January 1916, Aylmer would be able to commit approximately 9,900 infantry, 1340 cavalry, and 42 field guns.

Arrian says that after the fever had run for seven days, Alexander had to be summoned from the games to Hephaestion, who was seriously ill. He did not arrive in time; by the time he got there, Hephaestion was dead. Plutarch says that being a young man and a soldier, Hephaestion had ignored medical advice and <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> doctor, Glaucias, had gone off to the theatre, he ate a large breakfast consisting of a boiled fowl and a cooler of wine, and then fell sick and died.|$|E
25|$|Shortly afterwards, Dion {{came under}} {{increasing}} {{pressure from the}} party to immediately step down as Liberal leader.

His resignation took effect on 10 December 2008, upon the selection of Michael Ignatieff as interim leader. This makes Dion the second permanent Liberal leader in Canadian history not to become Prime Minister, after Edward Blake in 1887. On his retirement, Dion became the shortest serving non-interim leader of the Liberal Party since Confederation—serving for approximately four months less time (740 days to 855 days) of the next shortest serving leader, Paul Martin (2003–2006). Dion delivered a farewell speech on 2 May 2009, at the Liberal Party leadership convention.|$|E

In the evening of 22 October, Vardar Army gathered in the valley of Pčinja River. While Zeki Pasha had the precise information about the strength and disposal of the Serbian forces, the Serbian command did not realise that the battle with the main Ottoman force would start the very next morning. Not expecting the attack, Serbs did not fortify their positions, which were topographically strong. Still, only two out of five infantry divisions were deployed in the front echelon – Danube Division I on the left wing, with Cavalry Division behind it, and Morava Division I on the right wing. The left flank was particularly vulnerable, because Srtevica, the important topographic object, was defended by local irregulars.|$|E
25|$|Discussions {{about who}} would succeed Holt {{as leader of}} the Liberal Party began <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> {{disappearance}} became general knowledge. The situation was complicated by McEwen publicly announcing that the Country Party would leave the coalition if the Liberal Party selected Treasurer William McMahon (the party's deputy leader). The leadership election was not held until 9 January, the 23rd day after the disappearance. The four candidates were John Gorton, Paul Hasluck, Billy Snedden, and Les Bury. Gorton was elected over Hasluck on the second ballot, and was sworn in as prime minister the following day – the first senator to hold the office. In line with the constitutional convention that the prime minister must sit in the House of Representatives, he resigned from the Senate on 1 February to contest the by-election caused by Holt's death, which was held on 24 February. He won an easy victory, and was sworn in to the House on 12 March.|$|E
25|$|Noteworthy is {{that while}} {{organizing}} assistance to the Estonian mission, Pope Alexander III was also closely following the situation in Finland, something that no previous Pope {{is known to have}} done. Eskil and Stefan, the Archbishop of Uppsala, who had also been appointed to his high office by Eskil in 1164, were both close acquaintances with the Pope, having met in France while the Pope had been exiled there in the 1160s. In Pope's letter to Stefan in 1171 (or 1172), he complains how Finns only turned to God at the time of war, harassing preachers as soon as the peril was over. No Diocese or Bishop of Finland is mentioned in the papal letter, and no information survives, whether it prompted any actions. In the apparent shortage of missionaries, it can be speculated that the frustrated Pope may have organized Fulco to deal with the Finns <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> assistant Nicolaus could have taken over the missionary work in Estonia.|$|E
