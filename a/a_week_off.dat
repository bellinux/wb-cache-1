5|$|In October 2005, Foyt {{announced}} {{that at the}} end of the 2005 season, he would leave Foyt Enterprises and drive in the NASCAR Busch Series for the #38 Akins Motorsports team and was signed as a developmental driver for Evernham Motorsports. He ran several events in the #38 late in 2005, but failed to produce results. In 2006, he was scheduled to run the entire Busch Series schedule in the #38 and be a competitor for the Rookie of the Year award. However, early in the 2006 season, Akins was purchased by Braun Racing, which switched the #38 from Dodge to Chevrolet bodies. Foyt had an exclusive contract with Dodge that prevented him from continuing with the team. After <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>off,</b> Ray Evernham found him a ride with FitzBradshaw Racing, but he failed to qualify for his first race with the team and has not attempted a NASCAR race since.|$|E
60|$|He {{accepted}} Overbrook's next plaintive invitation, for <b>an</b> evening two <b>weeks</b> <b>off.</b> <b>A</b> dinner two <b>weeks</b> <b>off,</b> even <b>a</b> family dinner, {{never seems}} so appalling, till {{the two weeks}} have astoundingly disappeared and one comes dismayed to the ambushed hour. They had to change the date, because of their own dinner to the McKelveys, but at last they gloomily drove out to the Overbrooks' house in Dorchester.|$|R

25|$|After {{some poor}} form with the bat, Pettini decided to resign his county {{captaincy}} for {{all forms of}} the game in June 2010. James Foster took over as Essex captain. Pettini then took <b>a</b> few <b>weeks</b> <b>off</b> to work on his batting.|$|R
5|$|The season length {{was similar}} to the 2010 Claxton Shield by {{spreading}} ten rounds over twelve weeks, playing only the season's first game in the first week and taking <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>off</b> for Christmas and Boxing Day. Six teams were involved, playing a four-game series every week totaling two series against each team, one at home and one away. In total, the schedule allowed for 40regular season games per team before a four-team finals series. During the regular season, games were played Thursday to Sunday, varying depending on the series and team, with 18games scheduled as doubleheaders on a Saturday. Doubleheaders were scheduled to have the first of the two games shortened to seven innings, with the second game using the full nine innings.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{attaining}} the premiership, Chamberlain obtained {{passage of}} the Factories Act 1937. This Act was aimed at bettering working conditions in factories, and placed limits on the working hours of women and children. In 1938, Parliament enacted the Coal Act 1938, which allowed for nationalisation of coal deposits. Another major law passed that year was the Holidays with Pay Act. Though the Act only recommended that employers give workers <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>off</b> with pay, it led to a great expansion of holiday camps and other leisure accommodation for the working classes. The Housing Act of 1938 provided subsidies aimed at encouraging slum clearance and maintained rent control. Chamberlain's plans for the reform of local government were shelved because of the outbreak of war in 1939. Likewise, the raising of the school-leaving age to 15, scheduled for implementation on 1 September 1939, did not go into effect. In the event, it wasn't until 1 September 1972 when the age was raised from 15 to 16, following preparations which began 1964.|$|E
5|$|When Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is irritated that Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{will not}} fulfill his {{landlord}} responsibilities and fix the dangerously substandard office wiring, {{he comes up}} with a plan to pretend that magnetic power is affecting the office and thus get the repairs as well as <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>off</b> from work for his wife Pam (Jenna Fischer) (whom he is trying to be extra nice to in the wake of not telling her about his new job plans). Dwight calls Jim's bluff and rents an overcrowded bus for the staff to work on, but Jim harnesses the office workers' love of a local pie stand to please Pam. Dwight eventually gets angry and climbs into the roof of the bus, refusing to drive any further. Pam suspects something else is wrong and asks Jim to talk to him. Jim learns that Dwight thought his magnetic power prank was real as he suspects he is infertile, which he has convinced himself explains why he was not the father of Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) baby. Jim tells Dwight he is like a father to the entire office, and Dwight then drives everyone to the pie stand where they have a great finish to their day.|$|E

5|$|While some {{ships and}} units such as No 49 Squadron {{returned}} to the UK, most personnel had to remain on Christmas Island. The Minister of Supply gave assurances that no personnel would have {{to remain on the}} island {{for more than a year}} unless absolutely necessary, in which case home leave would be given. To maintain morale, units were given periodic briefings on the importance of their work. Junior officers took a keen interest in the welfare of the men and their families at home, since they were not permitted to bring them to the island. An efficient mail system was maintained to allow them to keep in contact. The quality of Army rations was better than at any other British base. The men were given one day <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>off</b> work, and sports such as soccer, cricket, tennis, volleyball sailing, fishing and water skiing were organised. Leave was provided that could be taken in Fiji, Hawaii or the Gilbert Islands. To relieve the monotony, some Army personnel ashore exchanged places with some Navy personnel afloat. A Christmas Island Broadcasting Service was established with nightly radio programs.|$|E

Keith Jackson, usually working with Tim McCarver did the #2 Monday night games. Bench took <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>off</b> in June (with Steve Busby filling in), and also worked one game with Michaels as the networks switched the announcer pairings. While Drysdale worked the All-Star Game in Houston as an interviewer {{he did not}} resurface until the playoffs. Bench simply disappeared, ultimately going to CBS Radio.|$|E
25|$|The Tour {{continues}} through the fall, with {{the focus on}} the scramble of the less successful players to earn enough money to retain their tour cards. A circuit known as the Fall Series, originally with seven tournaments but now with four, was introduced in 2007. In its inaugural year, its events were held in seven consecutive weeks, starting the week after the Tour Championship. As was the case for the FedEx Cup playoff schedule, the Fall Series schedule was also tweaked in 2008 and 2009. The first 2008 Fall Series event was held opposite the Ryder Cup, and the Fall Series took <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>off</b> for the Tour Championship before continuing with its remaining six events.|$|E

25|$|Woods {{played the}} {{following}} week at the WGC-Cadillac Championship in Miami, Florida. Tiger spent {{the first three days}} {{near the top of the}} leaderboard and shot 72-67-68 to start the fourth round in tied 8th place at 9-under par, 8 shots behind leader Bubba Watson. Woods struggled on the front 9 and shot 2-over par going out. He then began to noticeably limp on the next three holes and went on to withdraw from the tournament with an apparent left leg injury, which was later confirmed as a strain on his left Achilles tendon that had been injured previously at the 2011 Masters Tournament. After a short time off, Woods played in the Tavistock Cup at the Lake Nona Golf and Country Club, representing Team Albany, finishing 4th. The same week, Woods began the Arnold Palmer Invitational. After three rounds of 69, 65 and a 71, he began Sunday in the lead at 11-under par, one shot ahead of Graeme McDowell.

After <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>off,</b> he returned to Augusta for the Masters Tournament. Over the four days, Woods was never close to contending the title, and shot rounds of 72-75-72-74 to finish tied 40th. After a 3-week break from competition, Woods traveled to Charlotte, North Carolina, for the Wells Fargo Championship. Although starting positively with a 1-under par 71, Woods' second round of 73 (1-over) derailed his tournament hopes and resulted in him missing his eighth cut as a professional by 1 shot and second in as many years for the tournament. The following week, Woods played The Players Championship. After an opening round of 74 (2-over), he was in threat of missing a second consecutive cut, a first for his professional career, however after a 4-under 68, he was firmly staying in the tournament as well as being in the hunt for the weekend. However, a weekend charge never mounted despite good ball striking and he settled for T40th at 1-under par.|$|E
