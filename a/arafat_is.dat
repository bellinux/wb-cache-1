Even though foreign dignitaries were normally fictional on the show, producer Aaron Sorkin said it felt right to call the Chairman by his real name [...] "'cause Arafat's been around forever and he'll be around forever". In a later episode, however ("Gaza" [...] in season five), the name of the Chairman of the Palestinian Authority was changed to Nizar Farad, a fictional character.

The show continued to use the Farad character and never made any references to Arafat's successor Mahmoud Abbas.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Arafat</b> <b>is</b> {{about six}} hours’ very slow march, or twelve miles,[FN#14] on the Taif road, due east of Meccah. We arrived {{there in a}} shorter time, but our weary camels, during {{the last third of}} the way, {{frequently}} threw themselves upon the ground. Human beings suffered more. Between Muna and Arafat I saw no fewer than five men fall down and die upon the highway: exhausted and moribund, they had dragged themselves out to give up the ghost where it departs to instant beatitude.[FN#15] The spectacle showed {{how easy it is to}} die in these latitudes[FN#16]; each man suddenly staggered, fell as if shot; and, after a brief convulsion, lay still as marble. The corpses were carefully taken up, and carelessly buried that same evening, in a vacant space amongst the crowds encamped upon the Arafat plain.[FN#17] ...|$|E

5|$|<b>Arafat</b> <b>was</b> born in Cairo, Egypt.

[...] Chief of Staff Moshe Ya'alon and other Israeli officials declared that the Palestinian leader should [...] "either be killed or deported". Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said that Arafat impeded and undermined the peace process and urged states of the European Union to boycott Arafat. Deputy Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told Israel Radio that killing Arafat [...] "is definitely one of the options" [...] under consideration by the government. A Security Council resolution demanding that Israel desist from deporting Arafat or threatening his safety was vetoed by the United States.|$|E
5000|$|The vigil at Mount <b>Arafat</b> <b>is</b> another {{important}} aspect of the hajj which Pitts discusses. In chapter 7, Pitts says that they leave Mecca to visit “a certain hill called Gibbel el orphat (or el-Arafat), i.e., the Mountain of Knowledge.” Here he witnesses them perform Yawm al-Wukuf or the Day of Standing Together before God. Islamic legend explains that this hill was the place where Adam and Eve met after their expulsion from the Garden of Eden as well as where the Day of Judgment will take place. For pilgrims, it is “a place set aside for spiritual reunion, where pilgrims travel to re-form family ties, seek pardon, and re-collect their spirits.” Though it is the “how, when, and where pilgrims receive this honorable title of hajji for which they are at all this pains and expense," [...] Pitts claims that as to [...] "why they so solemnly approach this mountain beyond any other place and receive from hence the title of hagges" [...] he did not know, adding he gave [...] "but little heed to these delusions." [...] He describes the times that they perform their preparations for the prayers and rites to be completed while at the hill, and how [...] "they beg earnestly for the remission of their sins and promise newness of life using a form of penitential expressions and thus continuing for the space of four or five hours." ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{appeared}} in Strategic Insights (May 2002), v. 1 no. 3 Israel's assault on West Bank Palestinian towns throughout April 2002 and its even longer siege and then occupation of Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat's presidential compound in Ramallah, have raised legitimate {{questions about how}} long Arafat will remain in power in Palestine. After all, <b>Arafat</b> <b>is</b> already older than King Husayn of Jordan and Hafiz al-Asad of Syria were {{at the time of}} their deaths in recent years, and Arafat has suffered from a number of physical ailments, particularly since his near-fatal plane crash in Libya. In addition to the ravages of time, Arafat must also worry about assassination attempts, either from Palestinian dissidents or Israeli commandos. Even as the siege of <b>Arafat</b> <b>is</b> coming to an end, the questions of his physical longevity and of political succession in Palestine only intensify. The intent of this essay is not to predict which personality will eventually succeed Arafat, but rather to outline some of the major issues that will define the succession process when it occurs...|$|E

40|$|Succession and Authoritarianism in Palestine: What Next After Arafat? Wednesday, October 25, 2000 Report from a Palestine Center {{briefing}} with Robinson, Glenn E [...] The future successor of Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Chairman Yasser Arafat {{will not}} likely bring many surprises or dramatic changes, said Robinson, Glenn at an October 19 Palestine Center briefing. According to Robinson, {{associate professor at}} the U. S.

40|$|The {{stakes are}} very high, {{not just for}} Mr. Yasser Arafat's {{political}} survival but, more important, {{for the future of}} the Palestinians. Mr. Arafat confronts daunting tasks in responding to Hamas' bloody methods and in seizing the political initiative from the seasoned and effective Islamists. In the final analysis and regardless of the brutality of the Israeli military occupation, Hamas and Islamic Jihad have done considerable damage to the legitimate Palestinian cause, internally and externally. Their strategy of establishing a 'balance of terror' with the right-wing government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has been costly to Palestinians and Israelis alike and counterproductive as well. Mr. Sharon feels emboldened with a popular mandate to invade Palestinian-controlled territory and threatens to destroy the Palestinian Authority and the prospects for genuine peace. Despite his waning popularity, Mr. <b>Arafat</b> <b>is</b> still viewed as a powerful symbol of Palestinian nationalism and retains a deep residue of support within Palestinian society. He can be most effective by using the symbols of Palestinian nationalism to redefine the political debate less as a zero sum game, as Hamas and Islamic Jihad would like the Palestinians to believe, and more as a give-and-take bargaining process...|$|E
