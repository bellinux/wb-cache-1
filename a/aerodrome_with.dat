The squadron moved by the 22d, and on the 23d operations began from the new station. By early October, with the American infantry advancing on all points between the Argonne and the Meuse, German aircraft were concentrating all available resources to stop the Air Service from getting information about its rear areas. Enemy aircraft were constantly attacking squadron aircraft with a far higher intensity than what was experienced earlier, and the 91st brought down a number of enemy planes, far out of proportion to what might be expected from an observation squadron.|$|E
25|$|Being one of {{the most}} {{westerly}} parishes in England, St Buryan is somewhat isolated {{from the rest of the}} UK. The village of St Buryan is situated approximately five miles (eight km) west of Penzance along the B3283 which forks about five miles (8km) from the end of the A30, the major trunk road that runs the length of Cornwall. Three further minor roads also meet at St Buryan, two link the village with the B3315 towards Lamorna, and the third rejoins the A30 at Crows-an-Wra. St. Buryan is served by four bus routes. Services 1 and 1A run between Penzance and Land's End via Gwavas, Sheffield, St Buryan and Sennen. The 300 service runs a circular route via St Ives, St Just, Sennen, St Buryan and Newlyn. These routes are run by First South West. Western Greyhound service 501 runs on the same route as the 1/1A. Services run frequently from Penzance to the village until around 10pm during the summer months, but markedly less often in the winter. Travel by rail is via the Great Western Main Line whose westernmost terminus is located at nearby Penzance. Great Western Railway provides local services to nearby St Ives via the St Ives Bay Line as well as direct connections linking Penzance with Plymouth, Bath, Bristol, Newport and Cardiff. Intercity services are provided both by Great Western Railway, connecting Penzance with London Paddington, and CrossCountry who run services to Manchester via the West Coast Main Line and also direct services to Edinburgh Waverley and Glasgow Central via Birmingham, Sheffield, York, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne. St Buryan's closest airports are Land's End <b>Aerodrome,</b> <b>with</b> flights to the Isles of Scilly; and Newquay which carries flights to Gatwick and Stansted.|$|E

500|$|Lieutenant Verschoyle Phillip Cronyn later {{described}} his harrowing return flight. Being the rare targeted pilot to escape Voss's gun fire, he {{now had to}} coax home a failing machine destined for the scrapheap. He lost control of it banking for the landing pattern, and finally performed a desperate high speed landing at 18:40 hours, approximately coincidental with the triplane's impact. The 56 Squadron commander, Major Blomfield, led the shaky-kneed pilot from his machine to a bench and plied him with medicinal brandy. Cronyn's composure broke. After a fit of weeping, he pulled himself together as McCudden landed, followed by Rhys-Davids. The latter exited his machine hyperventilating and stammering. He got his tot of brandy, and uttered an account jumbled by his excitement. With the exception of Muspratt, who had landed at the 1 Squadron <b>aerodrome</b> <b>with</b> a seized engine, the rest of 56 Squadron landed back at Estr√©e-Blanche. Combat reports by the pilots were written and submitted; those from McCudden, Rhys-Davids, Bowman, Maybery, Hoidge, and Gardiner still exist. These fragmentary written documents would be supplemented by McCudden's autobiography, written before his death the following year; contradictory written accounts produced by Chidlaw-Roberts and Bowman in 1942; and Cronyn's memoirs of 1976. When corresponding with aviation historian Evan Hadingham in 1967, Cronyn offered, [...] "...movements were purely instinctive, and made on such split second action that no impression was recorded." [...] He offered as example that he was unaware he {{had spent most of}} his fight with Voss flying inverted until Muspratt mentioned it in the mess the evening of the fight.|$|E
500|$|On 22March, the {{day after}} he arrived in New Guinea, Jackson took No.75 Squadron on a dawn raid against the Japanese {{airfield}} at Lae. [...] Rather than attacking directly from the south, he led the Kittyhawks in from the east, where they would not be expected and where the rising sun would hide their approach. Achieving the surprise he had hoped for, Jackson made two strafing passes over the airfield, ignoring standard practice that called for only one such pass to reduce the risk from anti-aircraft fire. The Australians claimed a dozen Japanese planes destroyed on the ground and five more damaged. They also shot down two Mitsubishi Zero fighters in the air, and lost two Kittyhawks over Lae, along with one that had crash-landed on takeoff from Moresby. The Japanese struck back the next day, destroying two Kittyhawks at Seven Mile <b>Aerodrome.</b> <b>With</b> his losses mounting, Jackson was given permission to withdraw the squadron to Horn Island in Far North Queensland, but refused. On 4April, Jackson made a solo reconnaissance over Lae, after which he led another four Kittyhawks on a raid against the airfield, claiming seven enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground without loss to themselves; Japanese sources credited the Australians with only two machines destroyed, but seventeen others damaged. Two days later, Les Jackson was forced to ditch his aircraft on a coral reef, but made it to shore {{with the aid of a}} life jacket that John dropped to him, not realising at the time that the downed pilot was his younger brother.|$|E

500|$|Dallas {{was briefly}} hospitalised with the wounds to his thigh and heel on 14April, but sneaked out {{four days later}} to rejoin his squadron. His {{departure}} may have been spurred by news of the capture of his friend Richard Minifie. As {{soon as he was}} able, Dallas was flying again. By 26April, he had increased his official score to 37, and been awarded the Distinguished Service Order for operations at Dunkirk. He had also several times been recommended for the Victoria Cross, but it was never approved. His casual attitude towards claiming victories was noted by a member of No.40 Squadron, Cecil Usher, who related that Dallas once remarked of an opponent, [...] "...he went down belching a lot of black smoke and after he had gone down someways one of his planes came off, but I didn't see him crash so I shan't claim him." [...] On 2May, during a lull in the fighting at Flanders, Dallas took off in his S.E.5 to taunt his foes. He strafed the German base at La Brayelle to [...] "attract attention" [...] before dropping a package on the <b>aerodrome</b> <b>with</b> a note reading, [...] "If you won't come up here and fight, herewith a pair of boots for work on the ground, pilots for the use of". He then circled in mist until troops came to examine the bundle, whereupon he dropped two bombs and again shot up the base, causing [...] "general panic". News of this singular exploit reportedly provoked laughter from Field Marshal Haig and RAF founder General Sir Hugh Trenchard, two men not known for their sense of humour. While adding to his score and leading his squadron into combat, Dallas had begun thinking beyond the war. He was pleading with his father to quit the dangerous job of mining, with hints that he would support his parents by pioneering aviation in Australia. [...] He also harboured a long-standing ambition of flying from England back to Australia, which would be a record-setting journey.|$|E

Initially, [...] "B" [...] and [...] "C" [...] flights, 33 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps were based at the new <b>aerodrome</b> <b>with</b> [...] "A" [...] flight detached to nearby York Racecourse. Following a bombing raid on York on 2 May 1916 by Zeppelin airships, the airfield on York racecourse was closed, and 33 Squadron at RFC Bramham Moor became responsible for the air defence of Leeds, Sheffield and York against further Zeppelin attack. 33 Squadron's aircraft were the RAF BE 2c and BE 2d biplanes, these later being replaced by the much better FE 2b biplane. In early 1918, after the RAF was formed, RFC Bramham Moor became known as RAF Tadcaster. In July 1918, a group of American pilots and ground staff were based at Bramham Moor for training. When the USA had entered the First World War in 1917, their pilots had gone straight into action {{with a lack of}} combat experience and had suffered heavy losses. It was subsequently decided that all American pilots should pass through the British training schools such as the one at Bramham. After the First World War, with a reduced need for warplanes, the aerodrome was closed down in December 1919. One large hangar remains, as a listed building, among the barns of Headley Hall Farm. During the Second World War, dummy aeroplanes were left on the old runway so that from the air, it looked like an operational airfield.|$|E
