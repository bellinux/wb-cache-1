Brayne, who was now childless, failed to revise his will to leave his interest in the Theatre to James Burbage's children, as he had promised to do, and Burbage failed to grant Brayne a half interest in the 21-year ground lease which he had signed with Giles Allen on 13 April 1576, and kept it solely in his own name.

Brayne accused Burbage of double-dealing, and in the following month the partners submitted their dispute to arbitration by two friends, in the course of which Burbage struck Brayne and they fell to fisticuffs. On 12 July 1578 the arbitrators submitted the articles containing their decision, and both Burbage and Brayne signed bonds in the amount of £200 as a guarantee of performance.|$|E

I made this comparison {{on the basis of}} administrative requirements, taxation and financial performance. On the basis of several methods and considerations I have concluded that the loan is the best way. Assignment of the lease agreement is at first sight very disadvantageous. Leasing is a specific accounting situation, which is often difficult for accountants too. A mistake can be easily made during accounting of leasing operations.

As Kevin Gray and Susan Francis Gray put it in the context of a discussion <b>of</b> <b>leases,</b> ‘the lease is a curious hybrid which hovers between the worlds of property and contract’. So when a lease or mortgage is assigned, the question arises as to whether the benefit of all the covenants in the original contract transferred to the assignee, or only some of them. An analogous question relates to the burden of those covenants...|$|R

In 1856, Cross sued the United States in the Court of Claims for the delinquent installment payments, however the government prevailed by showing that the informal nature <b>of</b> the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lease</b> was defective and therefore insufficient for Cross to maintain a claim. The decision of the court was sent to Congress, which in 1864 passed 13 Stat. 591.

50|$|But {{it is not}} {{necessary}} to rest our judgment of affirmance of the decree of the court below upon any consideration of the character of those transactions. After seven years' acquiescence in the lease, something more must be shown than that it was executed in excess of the powers of the directors before the lessee will be required to surrender the profits he has made under it. The lease expired June 1, 1874; the disposition of the property was settled by the agreement of March 15, 1876, and the release is an answer to all claims for the profits made by the defendants. The release is of itself sufficient to justify the dismissal of the bill. There is no evidence that it was obtained upon any fraudulent representations. Nothing was kept from the parties when it was executed. Indeed, all the transactions between the defendants and the company, from the time they took from Frost an <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lease,</b> were open and well known. There was no concealment, either had or attempted, of anything that was done, and no just reason can be given for disturbing the settlement made.|$|R
50|$|With {{regard to}} the former of these classes, it may be noticed that {{although}} apportioned rent becomes payable only when the whole rent is due, the landlord, {{in the case of}} the bankruptcy of an ordinary tenant, may prove for a proportionate part of the rent up to the date of the receiving order; and that a similar rule holds good in the winding up of a company; and further that the act of 1870 applies to the liability to pay, as well as to the right to receive, rent. Accordingly, where an <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> a <b>lease</b> is made between two half-yearly rent-days, the assignee is not liable to pay the full amount of the half-year's rent falling due on the rent-day next after the date <b>of</b> the <b>assignment,</b> but only an apportioned part of that half-year's rent, computed from the last mentioned date. If you pay a ground rent on a leasehold property or a rentcharge on a freehold property that is also payable on other neighbouring properties, you can apply to the Department for Communities and Local Government for an ‘order of apportionment’ that legally separates your share of the ground rent or rentcharge.|$|R

With some reluctance Hyde complied, and on 7 June 1589 assigned {{his interest in the}} ground <b>lease</b> <b>of</b> the Theatre to Cuthbert Burbage.

He later deposed that he agreed only to save his father from debt, and was of the view that he could have used his influence with Cope to better personal advantage. He was forced to borrow money to pay Hyde, and although the amount is not known with certainty, a statement by Hyde himself indicates that it was almost the entire original debt of £125 8s 11d plus interest.|$|R
