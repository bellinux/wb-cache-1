5|$|Keable's {{most famous}} {{publication}} {{was his first}} novel, Simon Called Peter, but he produced <b>a</b> <b>prodigious</b> literary output, spanning theological tracts through poetry to travel guides. Simon Called Peters sequel, Recompense, {{was made into a}} film, and his later novels all attracted substantial attention. His writings generally met with much greater popular than critical approbation, and Simon Called Peter was sufficiently incendiary to be banned. The book nonetheless became a contemporary best-seller.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} and isolation of radium in uranium ore (pitchblende) by Marie Curie sparked {{the development of}} uranium mining to extract the radium, which was used to make glow-in-the-dark paints for clock and aircraft dials. This left <b>a</b> <b>prodigious</b> quantity of uranium as a waste product, since it takes three tonnes of uranium to extract one gram of radium. This waste product was diverted to the glazing industry, making uranium glazes very inexpensive and abundant. Besides the pottery glazes, uranium tile glazes accounted {{for the bulk of}} the use, including common bathroom and kitchen tiles which can be produced in green, yellow, mauve, black, blue, red and other colors.|$|E
5|$|The strict {{definition}} of Heinrich events is the climatic event causing the IRD layer observed in marine sediment cores from the North Atlantic: a massive collapse of northern hemisphere ice shelves {{and the consequent}} release of <b>a</b> <b>prodigious</b> volume of icebergs. By extension, the name Heinrich events can also refer to the associated climatic anomalies registered at other places around the globe, at approximately the same time periods. The events are rapid: they last probably less than a millennium, a duration varying from one event to the next, and their abrupt onset may occur in mere years (Maslin et al. 2001). Heinrich events are clearly observed in many North Atlantic marine sediment cores covering the last glacial period; the lower resolution of the sedimentary record before this point {{makes it more difficult}} to deduce whether they occurred during other glacial periods in the Earth's history. Some (Broecker 1994, Bond & Lotti 1995) identify the Younger Dryas event as a Heinrich event, which would make it event H0 (table, right).|$|E

25|$|Engler {{published}} <b>a</b> <b>prodigious</b> {{number of}} taxonomic works. He used various artists to illustrate his books, notably Joseph Pohl (1864–1939), an illustrator {{who had served}} an apprenticeship as a wood-engraver. Pohl's skill drew Engler's attention, starting a collaboration of some 40 years. Pohl produced more than 33 000 drawings in 6 000 plates for Die naturlichen Pflanzenfamilien. He also illustrated Das Pflanzenreich (1900–1953), Die Pflanzenwelt Afrikas (1908–1910), Monographien afrikanischer Pflanzenfamilien (1898–1904) and the journals Engler's botanische Jahrbücher.|$|E

25|$|Cameron was a lower-order {{right-handed}} batsman of uncomplicated {{methods and}} a bowler who began as <b>a</b> <b>prodigious</b> leg-spin and googly bowler, but turned to off-breaks {{when he lost}} the knack of finger spin.

His bowling was slightly slower through the air than Warne's, but he was <b>a</b> <b>prodigious</b> turner of the ball.|$|E

60|$|As long as {{he could}} {{possibly}} contain himself, Jerry maintained his stiffness. And then, his love bursting beyond the control of him, he gave <b>a</b> sniff--as <b>prodigious</b> <b>a</b> one as he had sniffed into the tunnel of Skipper's hand in the long ago {{on the deck of the}} Arangi. And, as Skipper had relaxed into the laughter of love, so did the lady-god now. She gurgled gleefully. Her fingers tightened, in a caress that almost hurt, on Jerry's muzzle. Her other hand and arm crushed him against her till he gasped. Yet all the while his stump of tail valiantly bobbed back and forth, and, when released from such blissful contact, his silky ears flattened back and down as, with first a scarlet slash of tongue to cheek, he seized her hand between his teeth and dented the soft skin with a love bite that did not hurt.|$|R
