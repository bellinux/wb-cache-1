25|$|Many {{complexity}} {{classes are}} defined using {{the concept of}} a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem X can be solved using an algorithm for Y, X is no more difficult than Y, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>say</b> that X reduces to Y. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as Cook reductions, Karp reductions and Levin reductions, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as polynomial-time reductions or log-space reductions.|$|E

Their T in the Park headline slot {{was put in}} jeopardy after Graham Coxon was admitted to hospital with food poisoning. Ultimately, the band did play, albeit {{an hour and a}} half after they were scheduled to appear. After the completion of the reunion dates, James said the group had not discussed further plans, and Albarn told Q soon after that Blur had no intention of recording or touring again. He said, [...] "I just can't do it anymore", and explained that the main motivation for participating in the reunion was to repair his relationship with Coxon, which he succeeded at. Coxon also said that no further Blur activity was planned, telling NME.com in September, [...] "We're in touch <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>say</b> 'Wotcha' and all that but nothing has been mentioned about any more shows or anything else".|$|E

Since the route came nowhere near US93, AASHTO instead suggested US491, noting it as {{a branch of}} US191 at Monticello, Utah. Although the next three-digit child of US91 would have been U.S. Route291, both the 291 and 391 designations were already in use as state route numbers {{in at least one}} of the affected states. At the news that the motion had passed, a New Mexico spokesperson stated, [...] "The devil's out of here, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>say</b> goodbye and good riddance." [...] Referring to the motion passing with a different number from what New Mexico requested, another spokesperson responded, [...] "As long as it's not 666 and it's nothing satanic, that's OK." [...] US666 officially ceased to exist on May 31, 2003, although temporary [...] "New 491– Old666" [...] signs were posted after the change to aid travelers using old maps.|$|E

500|$|The DSi helped {{maintain}} strong {{sales for}} Nintendo's handheld product line. The DSi accounted for 40 {{percent of its}} product line's 2009 UK sales and frequently topped weekly sales charts in Japan during its first year of availability. In the United States, the console's initial three-month sales surpassed those of the DS, DS Lite, and Wii. Average weekly sales of the Wii and Nintendo DS declined slightly in March; Nintendo DS hardware sales stabilized at over 200,000 units for seven months after the DSi's April launch, while Wii sales diminished. Gamasutra estimated that, in October 2009 and February 2010, 50 percent of Nintendo DS unit sales were DSi consoles. In an October 2009 interview, Fils-Aimé announced that the DSi had sold 2.2 million units in the United States. He said, [...] "If you give the consumer great value {{in terms of what}} they pay, they're willing to spend, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>say</b> [...] based on the experience of launching the DSi". The United States had its highest yearly DS sales in 2009 with 11.22 million units sold. The DSi and DSi XL accounted for 16.88 million of the 27.11 million units sold worldwide of its product line for Nintendo's 2009 fiscal year beginning April 1, 2009 and ending March 31, 2010.|$|E

2500|$|In most {{situations}} relativistic {{effects can}} be neglected, and Newton's laws give a sufficiently accurate description of motion. The acceleration of a body {{is equal to the}} sum of the forces acting on it, divided by its mass, and the gravitational force acting on a body is proportional to the product of the masses of the two attracting bodies and decreases inversely with the square of the distance between them. To this Newtonian approximation, for a system of two point masses or spherical bodies, only influenced by their mutual gravitation (called a two-body problem), their trajectories can be exactly calculated. If the heavier body is much more massive than the smaller, {{as in the case of}} a satellite or small moon orbiting a planet or for the Earth orbiting the Sun, it is accurate enough and convenient to describe the motion in terms of a coordinate system that is centered on the heavier body, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>say</b> that the lighter body is in orbit around the heavier. For the case where the masses of two bodies are comparable, an exact Newtonian solution is still sufficient and can be had by placing the coordinate system [...] at the center of mass of the system.|$|E
