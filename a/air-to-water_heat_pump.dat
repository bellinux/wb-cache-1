40|$|Strategy of the European Union in {{efficient}} energy usage {{demands to}} have a higher proportion of renewable energy in the energy market. Since heat pumps are considered {{to be one of the}} most efficient heating and cooling systems, they will play an important role in the energy consumption reduction in buildings aimed to meet the target of nearly zero energy buildings set out in the EU Directive 2010 / 31 /EU. Unfortunately, the declared heat pump Coefficient of Performance (COP) corresponds to a certain outdoor temperature (+ 7 °C), therefore different climate conditions, building characteristics and settings result in different COP values during the year. The aim of this research is to investigate the Seasonal Performance factor (SPF) values of <b>air-to-water</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> which better characterize the effectiveness of heat pump in a longer selected period of time, especially during the winter season, in different types of residential buildings in Latvian climate conditions.

For an optimal use of building envelope, BIPVT systems, consisting of flat-plate PVT solar collectors, are integrated in the south facing facade of a non-residential high-rise building. The BIPVT collectors produce: i) thermal energy for space heating purposes, by a radiant floor system, and Domestic Hot Water (DHW) production, and ii) electricity to satisfy the building energy demand. Electric <b>air-to-water</b> <b>heat</b> pumps/chillers and water-to water <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> are used as auxiliary systems for space heating / cooling and DHW preparation, respectively. In addition, with the aim to mitigate the effects of solar energy intermittency and obtain a virtually grid-independent system, an electricity energy storage system coupled to the BIPVTs system is modeled. In order to compare the proposed BIPVT system to a traditional building, a reference building model, i. e. without BIPVTs, energy storage and radiant floor, is considered. Here, the space heating and cooling is obtained by <b>air-to-water</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> (one for each floor), DHW is produced by a condensing boiler and electricity is supplied by the national grid. The comparison is performed for three thermal zones, well representative of the thermal behavior of the whole building.

The results showed that the rate of frost formation and degradation in the heat pump performance is dependent upon both temperature and humidity, the effects of which should be taken into consideration in the design of defrost control mechanisms. The air pressure-differential across the evaporator gives and adequate indication of the level of frost on the coil and can be used to initiate the defrost cycle. Over the whole range of conditions tested, it was found that a defrost time of 5 minutes was enough to completely remove the frost from the evaporator coil. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} percentage of energy requirements, in Europe, is due to heating of buildings. In particular, constructions built in Italy before 1945 are characterized by low energy efficiency and represent a significant share (about 30 %) of the total built stock. Retrofit actions in this field can lead to valuable energetic and economic savings. In this work, we ran a dynamic simulation of a historical building of the University of Pisa (suitable benchmark for many Italian public administration buildings) during the heating season. In the first phase, we evaluated the energy requirements {{of the building and}} the performance of the existing natural gas boiler, validated with past billings of natural gas. In the second phase, we verified the energetic savings obtainable by the substitution of the boiler with an <b>air-to-water</b> electrically-driven modulating <b>heat</b> <b>pump,</b> simulated through a cycle-based model. We also evaluated the main economic metrics, viz. : discounted payback period, internal rate of return, net present value and profitability index at the expected end of life of the <b>heat</b> <b>pump.</b> The cycle-based model of the <b>heat</b> <b>pump,</b> validated with manufacturers’ data available only at specified temperature and load conditions, can provide more accurate results than simplified models adopted by current technical standards, thus increasing the effectiveness of energy audits...|$|R
40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} is done to {{evaluate}} four different questions. A literature survey in addition to three case studies are first {{used to determine the}} challenges of HVAC systems in buildings renovated to low-energy buildings and the development trend in the market. The literature and case studies showed that client expectations and budget, policies and regulations, everything working as a whole, and a high level of occupant control were all challenges and important factors affecting the success of a construction project. The three case studies had various systems installed, including ground source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps,</b> <b>air-to-water</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps,</b> <b>heat</b> recovery in air handling units and solar screens to name a few. The choice of these, however, depended on the building characteristics and its environment. The second part of the thesis evaluates firstly whether the HVAC systems in a school building, Stasjonsfjellet Skole, is able to achieve a satisfactory indoor climate, as well as whether the focus on reducing the energy use in the building has an adverse effect on the indoor climate. Through IDA ICE simulations of the building, in addition to a user survey, the HVAC systems were concluded to provide a somewhat sufficiently satisfactory indoor climate in the parts of the building, but not for every zone. Some of the zones had very high temperatures, daylighting levels and PPD levels. Furthermore, the users complained that the temperature in the building in general was too low. Although this was not consistent with temperature results from IDA ICE, the simulations showed a low RH level in the colder months of the year, which may cause discomfort for occupants even at moderate temperatures (Novakovic, et al., 2007). Furthermore, the generalization of the standards and regulations was concluded to result in the building having variable indoor climate levels from room to room, indicating that the generalized values are not adapted for the different requirements of the different rooms. I addition to the conclusions the indoor climate is not completely satisfactory in the building, the focus on reducing the energy use was concluded to have an adverse effect on the indoor temperature. Although there had been improvements to the indoor environment in the building, the lack of cooling caused the building to be too warm in the summer months. Also, given that the temperature was too low for the users due to the low RH levels and varying between the zones, showed that demand control of the HVAC systems to save energy may have an adverse effect on the user comfort. Lastly, the results and conclusions from the different case studies were evaluated as to whether they could be extended to other buildings. Although all buildings are different, similar school buildings may show similar results when the same systems are installed. Furthermore, the results and conclusions concerning the office buildings may be applied to other buildings as they are highly general. Although the solutions chosen will vary from building to building, the expectations and budget of the client, standards and regulations, optimally interacting systems and a high level of occupant control will all be difficulties and important factors for any construction project, whether it is a retrofitted or new one. Also, the conclusions concerning the generalization of standards and regulations and a need for shading and cooling, although dependent on building characteristics, will be applicable to any building...|$|R
40|$|Protocols and {{regulations}} {{such as the}} Montreal Protocol (1987), the Kyoto Protocol (1997), the European F-gas regulation (2006) and now its revision (2014) cause a shift toward refrigerants with both zero Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP) and low Global Warming Potential (GWP). Alternative refrigerants with low-GWP are under investigation for residential <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> and air-conditioners as R- 410 A has a GWP of 2088. In this study, two promising alternative refrigerants with a low-GWP, DR- 5 A (R- 454 B) and L 41 - 2 (R- 447 A), both HFC-HFO mixtures with a GWP of 466 and 583 respectively, have been tested in a residential <b>heat</b> <b>pump.</b> Â To assess and to compare the <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> performances using R- 410 A, DR- 5 A and L 41 - 2, drop-in tests {{have been carried out}} in a 10 kW <b>air-to-water</b> reversible <b>heat</b> <b>pump.</b> For each refrigerant, the <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> performances have been assessed for 2 rating conditions and 2 operating limit conditions in the cooling mode and for 6 rating conditions and 3 operating limit conditions in the heating mode. The tests have been performed according to the ENÂ 14511 standard. This experimental investigation has been carried out in three phases. In the first one, the performances of the <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> using R- 410 A have been evaluated. Then, in phases 2 and 3, both alternative refrigerants, DR- 5 A and L 41 - 2, have been tested. For each, a refrigerant charge optimization has been done, then the rating and operating limit condition tests have been performed, and finally, a performance verification using R- 410 A has been carried out to detect any anomaly after the use of {{one or the other of}} these alternative refrigerants. During all the tests, measurements have allowed to determine the thermal capacities, the electric energy consumptions, the efficiencies (EER or COP), as well as the refrigerant circuit pressures and discharge temperatures. Â A total of 39 tests have been performed. The refrigerant charge optimization drives to decrease the charge in the <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> by 15 % for DR- 5 A and by 21 % for L 41 - 2 in comparison with R- 410 A. The results show that R- 410 A replacement by L 41 - 2 and DR- 5 A do not raise any particular problem even in operating limit condition tests and the performances obtained are, aside from some exceptions, almost equivalent (+/- 10 %) to those of R- 410 A. Globally, DR- 5 A shows higher capacities and performances than L 41 - 2...|$|R
