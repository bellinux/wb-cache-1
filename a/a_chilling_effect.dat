Pacific Internet lawsuit, Koshy {{expressed}} {{his belief that}} SingNet might be in breach {{of the spirit of}} the Telecommunications Competition Code, which protects the confidentiality of subscribers' information and prohibits unauthorised release. Another lawyer interviewed by ZDNet, however, did not think that SingNet's actions were improper, and a spokesman for the Infocomm Development Authority announced that SingNet was found to be in compliance with the code. Andy Ho, another The Straits Times editor, expressed concern that private entities might use intellectual property laws invasively, thus precipitating <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> on free speech; he called for privacy laws to be quickly enacted.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution only {{requires}} {{members of}} the Council to be Singapore citizens residing in Singapore who are at least 35 years old. There is no restriction on Cabinet ministers and members of political parties. Moreover, the Prime Minister may authorize any Minister, Minister of State or Parliamentary Secretary to attend Council meetings. It has been noted that this may have <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> on the Council's deliberations as such a guest might be the author or a vocal proponent of the legislation under scrutiny. On the other hand, {{it has been suggested}} that members with political affiliations can often make the biggest contribution towards the Council's discussions. Another criticism of the PCMR's composition is that having judges on the Council may lead to a conflict of interest as they may have to exercise judicial review over Acts of Parliament they have either endorsed or rejected previously.|$|E

25|$|According to {{a survey}} {{undertaken}} by the human rights group PEN International, these disclosures have had <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> on American writers. Fearing {{the risk of being}} targeted by government surveillance, 28% of PEN's American members have curbed their usage of social media, and 16% have self-censored themselves by avoiding controversial topics in their writings.|$|E
25|$|However, the American Library Association {{strongly}} {{objected to}} the provision, believing that library records are fundamentally different from ordinary business records, and that the provision would have <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> on free speech.

25|$|The Rind et al. {{controversy}} was {{a debate}} in the scientific literature, public media, and government legislatures in the United States regarding a 1998 peer reviewed meta-analysis of the self-reported harm caused by child sexual abuse (CSA).

25|$|This {{resulted}} in a strong and swift negative reaction from nationalists, {{especially those in the}} army, culminating in his assassination {{in the course of the}} February 26 Incident. This had <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> on all civilian bureaucrats in the Japanese government. From 1934, the military's dominance of the government continued to grow. Instead of reducing deficit spending, the government introduced price controls and rationing schemes that reduced, but did not eliminate inflation, which remained a problem until the end of World WarII.|$|E
25|$|In early March 2016, the Office of the Ombudsman {{ordered the}} {{dismissal}} of Valenzuela City Mayor Rex Gatchalian and six other city and fire officials for grave misconduct and gross neglect of duty {{in connection with the}} factory fire. The ombudsman said that Gatchalian, Padayao, Carreon, and Avendan were liable for issuing business permits to Kentex Manufacturing Corp. in 2015 despite its delinquent status. On his part, Gatchalian has already secured a temporary restraining order (TRO) from the Court of Appeals against the dismissal order by the Ombudsman. He also said that, if the order will be implemented, it will have <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> on mayors from the highly urbanized cities who issue provisional business permits to establishments.|$|E
25|$|These clauses could {{potentially}} outlaw any free software capable of reading DRM-using formats (music, video, or even text content); the {{fear was that}} free software implementing DRM would be construed as facilitating circumvention. Designers of software knowingly facilitating circumvention would, with the initial draft, face felony charges of counterfeiting with a maximum penalty of a â‚¬300,000 fine and/or three years in prison. Free software advocates thus concluded that the law would have <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> {{on the development of}} free software in France, since any modern desktop system is {{supposed to be able to}} read music and video content, and their designers could not be sure whether they would face felony charges.|$|E

50|$|Yuki Noguchi, a {{reporter}} for NPR, said that Damore's firing has raised questions regarding the limits of free speech in the workplace. First Amendment free speech protections usually do not extend into the workplace, as the First Amendment restricts government action but not the actions of private employers, and employers {{have a duty to}} protect their employees against a hostile work environment. Lack of free speech protection in the workplace was cited as creating <b>a</b> possible <b>chilling</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|R
25|$|Gamergate {{supporters}} were {{critical of the}} wave of articles calling for diversity that followed the initial outbreak of the controversy; interpreting them as an attack on games and gamer culture. Gamergaters responded with a coordinated email campaign that demanded advertisers drop several involved publications; in a five-step 'war plan' against organizations that offended them, a Gamergate posting described how they would choose {{from a list of}} target organizations, pick a grievance from a list others had compiled, and send a form letter containing it to an advertiser. Intel reacted to this by withdrawing an ad campaign from Gamasutra in October 2014. After a number of game developers criticized Intel for this, arguing that it could have <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> on free speech and that it amounted to supporting harassment, Intel apologized for appearing to take sides in the controversy and resumed advertising on Gamasutra in mid-November.|$|E
25|$|In April 2010, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli {{claimed that}} leading climate {{scientist}} Michael E. Mann had possibly violated state fraud laws, and without providing {{any evidence of}} wrongdoing, filed the Attorney General of Virginia's climate science investigation as a civil demand that the University of Virginia provide {{a wide range of}} records broadly related to five research grants Mann had obtained as an assistant professor at the university from 1999 to 2005. This litigation was widely criticized in the academic community as politically motivated and likely to have <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> on future research. The university filed a court petition and the judge dismissed Cuccinelli's demand on the grounds that no justification had been shown for the investigation. Cuccinelli issued a revised subpoena, and appealed the case to the Virginia Supreme Court which ruled in March 2012 that Cuccinelli did not have the authority to make these demands. The outcome was hailed as a victory for academic freedom.|$|E
25|$|According to Rapid Assessment surveys {{conducted}} by the World Bank Group in 2011 and 2012, business managers rank informal gifts or payments, anticompetitive practices and regulatory policy uncertainty {{high on the list}} of obstacles to creating and growing a business. These impediments have <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> on foreign investment in Egypt which means that local businesses cannot be competitive in the international economy because of the high costs of raising capital. In addition, the amount of paperwork required for construction, imports, and exports is burdensome and the time for the government to process this paperwork is lengthy. Traders need to submit 8 documents to export and 10 to importâ€”as opposed to France, for example, where only 2 documents are needed both for imports and exports. The high cost of doing business leads to fewer businesses operating within Egypt which causes unemployment. Egypt's unemployment rate reached 11.8 percent in the second quarter of 2011, down from 11.9 percent in the first quarter (although higher than last year's 8.96 percent). Additionally, there is no bankruptcy law in Egypt and entrepreneurs that fail to pay debts can face prison sentences.|$|E

Justice Byron White wrote for the majority {{that most of the}} matters Myers' questionnaire had touched on were of personal, not public, concern and that the action had damaged the harmonious relations necessary for the efficient operation of the district attorney's office. William Brennan argued in dissent that the majority's application of precedent was flawed.

500|$|In 2000, Marvin Johnson, a {{legislative}} {{counsel for the}} ACLU, stated that proposed anti-spam legislation infringed on free speech by denying anonymity and by forcing spam to be labeled as such, [...] "Standardized labeling is compelled speech." [...] He also stated, [...] "It's relatively simple to click and delete." [...] The debate found the ACLU joining with the Direct Marketing Association and the Center for Democracy and Technology in 2000 in criticizing a bipartisan bill in the House of Representatives. As early as 1997, the ACLU had taken a strong position that nearly all spam legislation was improper, although it has supported [...] "opt-out" [...] requirements in some cases. The ACLU opposed the 2003 CAN-SPAM act suggesting {{that it could have}} <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> on speech in cyberspace. It has been criticized for this position.|$|E
500|$|Banks first {{commanded}} a military district in eastern Maryland, which notably included Baltimore, {{a hotbed of}} secessionist sentiment and a vital rail link. [...] Banks {{for the most part}} stayed out of civil affairs, allowing political expression of secessionism to continue, while maintaining important rail connections between the north and Washington, DC. He did, however arrest the police chief and commissioners of the city of Baltimore, and replaced the police force with one that had more carefully vetted pro-Union sympathies. [...] In August 1861, Banks was assigned to the western district of Maryland. [...] There he was responsible for the arrest of legislators sympathetic to the Confederate cause (as was John Adams Dix, who succeeded Banks in the eastern district) in advance of legislative elections. [...] This, combined with the release of local soldiers in his army to vote, ensured that the Maryland legislature remained pro-Union. Banks's actions had <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> on Confederate sentiment in Maryland. [...] Although it was a slave state, it remained loyal through the war.|$|E

[...] But Harlan, writing for the majority, concluded that the government had not argued that the advertising made the materials obscene.

50|$|The citizens' {{right of}} {{assembly}} was revoked and no political demonstrations were allowed. Surveillance on citizens {{was a fact}} of life, even during permitted social activities. That had <b>a</b> continuously <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> on the population who realised that, {{even though they were}} allowed certain social activities, they could not overstep the boundaries and delve into or discuss forbidden subjects. This realisation, including the absence of any civil rights as well as maltreatment during police arrest, ranging from threats to beatings or worse, made life under the junta a difficult proposition for many ordinary citizens. Photography by ordinary citizens was banned in public locations.|$|R
500|$|In his 2008 National Day Rally speech, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong {{indicated}} that the purpose behind various government policies, including the creation of Speakers' Corner, was to [...] "liberalise our society, to widen the space for expression and participation". Its reception was mixed, however, {{and there have been}} a wide range of views and perspectives on the impact of Speakers' Corner in increasing the space for free speech and the freedom to assemble. It has been called an [...] "exercise in tokenism" [...] for the purpose of preserving a literal [...] "space" [...] for engaging in free speech while also [...] "cornering" [...] it in that space. This is reflected in the relative lack of progress towards liberalization in other areas such as awards of high damages in libel lawsuits brought by politicians which has been said to have <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> on political speech in Singapore. Former Workers' Party member James Gomez has also expressed concerns about the effectiveness of the Speakers' Corner as a site of vibrant political debate, citing the lack of a [...] "culture of speaking" [...] amongst Singaporeans. The ban on racially or religiously sensitive speech has been criticized as possibly curtailing free speech on genuine political matters and limiting the scope of constitutionally entrenched fundamental liberties.|$|E
500|$|Lord Brown concurred. [...] He {{said that}} [...] "the gains to {{be derived from}} denying [...] {{immunity}} from suit for breach of that duty substantially exceed whatever loss might be thought likely to result from this", since a potential liability would lead to a [...] "sharpened awareness of the risks of pitching their initial views of the merits of their clientâ€™s case too high or too inflexibly lest these views come to expose and embarrass them at a later date." [...] He thought that this was a [...] "healthy development". It would also ensure that a client who was caused loss by an expert witness acting in [...] "an egregious manner" [...] would receive a proper remedy; he said that such cases were likely to be [...] "highly exceptional". Lord Collins, agreeing, noted that the result did not affect the position of the expert vis-a-vis the opposing litigant, where there were [...] "wider considerations of policy" [...] against allowing claims. He also remarked that the existing ability to prosecute expert witnesses for perjury or to take disciplinary proceedings against them for unprofessional conduct in preparing or presenting their evidence did not fit with the claim that a liability to their clients for breach of duty would have <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> on experts' willingness to give evidence.
