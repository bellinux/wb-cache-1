50|$|Unexpected alert dialogs are {{particular}} culprits of mode errors {{with potentially}} severe consequences. Usability practitioners prescribe that dangerous actions should be undoable wherever possible; an <b>alert</b> <b>box</b> that appears unexpectedly or is dismissed by habituation doesn't protect from the dangerous action. A modeless infobar is increasingly seen as preferable to a dialog box {{because it does}} not interrupt the user's activities, but rather allows the user to read extra information in their own time.|$|E
50|$|This is {{explained}} by a common complaint about {{the wording of the}} message in the <b>alert</b> <b>box,</b> which is often incomprehensible to the user. In applications without proper user-centered design, the developers decide the text of the message, including terms and concepts from the mental model of the programmer, not of the user's view of the world. Since the dialog doesn't work to accomplish the user needs, the common reaction will be to dismiss the alert without further consideration.|$|E

50|$|Overflowing GDI {{capacity}} {{can affect}} Windows itself, preventing new windows from opening, menus from displaying, and <b>alert</b> <b>boxes</b> from appearing. The situation {{can be difficult}} to clear and can potentially require a forced hard-reset of the system, since it prevents core system programs from functioning. In Windows 8 and 8.1, forced logoffs occur as a result of GDI capacity overflow instead of a hard reboot.|$|R
5000|$|The Bomb icon is {{a symbol}} {{designed}} by Susan Kare that was displayed inside the System Error <b>alert</b> <b>box</b> when the [...] "classic" [...] Macintosh operating system (pre-Mac OS X) had a crash which the system decided was unrecoverable. It was similar to a dialog box in Windows 9x that said [...] "This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down." [...] Since the classic Mac OS offered little memory protection, an application crash would often take down the entire system.|$|E
30|$|The next screen has {{a button}} “scan” which scans the current RSSI values {{of all the}} AP’s and compares them to the nearest values in the dataset using RMSE method and calculates the nearest position. In case of dataset mode of usage, an {{additional}} button is provided i.e. “improve” button. Given the dynamic nature of the environment, the RSSI values change and thus the dataset should be refined {{with more and more}} possible data tuples. Therefore the new improved coordinates can be entered in the <b>alert</b> <b>box,</b> after clicking on the button. The new coordinates get written on the dataset on both the server and the phone’s memory, by running a simple php script on the server and in the app.|$|E
30|$|Upon {{launching}} the study application, {{the participant was}} prompted via an <b>alert</b> <b>box</b> to set the answer to their challenge question, as a backup to the transparent authentication method. If a task was not allowed because device confidence was lower than the required task confidence, the participant was notified via an alert that stated the required task confidence and the current device confidence, and asked if the participant wanted to answer their challenge question. If the participant said yes (and answered it correctly), the device confidence was increased by one level (i.e., from Low to Medium or Medium to High). After providing a baseline answer to the challenge question, the participant saw the main “Tasks” screen. All participants completed the tasks in the same order. The order of the tasks were from low to high security, and dictated whether or not explicit authentication was required.|$|E

40|$|A {{lightweight}} role-based {{access control}} policy authoring tool was developed for e- Scientists, a community where access policies have to be implemented for an increasingly heterogeneous group of local and remote users. Two fundamental problems were identified (1) lack of understanding what the policy components are (i. e. how authorization policies are structured), and (2) {{lack of understanding of}} the underlying policy paradigm (i. e. what should go into the policy, and what should be left out). Conceptual design (CD) techniques were used to revise the user interface (UI) labels so that e-Scientists and developers were better able to describe access policy components from labels, and match labels with components (t= 6. 28, df= 7, p=. 000 two tailed). CD, instructional text, bubble help, UI behaviour and <b>alert</b> <b>boxes</b> were used to shape users? models of the policy paradigm. The final prototype improved users? efficiency and effectiveness by: more than doubling the speed with which expert users could write authorization policies; and facilitating users without specialist security knowledge to overcome the policy paradigm and components problems, enabling them to complete 80 % of basic and 75 % of advanced authorization policy writing tasks in a usability trial...|$|R
40|$|Run-time {{generation}} of JavaScript code by Perl CGI programs {{is a technique}} {{that has been used}} with considerable success at the Aerodynamics Laboratory of the Institute for Aerospace Research, National Research Council of Canada. After a brief introduction to the basic concept of dynamic code generation and its role within the data acquisition, data display and test-control software of the 2 m x 3 m wind tunnel, four specific examples will be presented each highlighting a different application of the technique. The first and simplest example will show the {{generation of}} trivial one-line JavaScript programs. The second example will show the run-time generation of JavaScript functions that modify groups of HTML checkbox elements. The third example will cover form validation in the browser, complete with pop-up <b>alert</b> <b>boxes</b> and dynamic images to prompt the user. The final, and most complex case, will show the creation of JavaScript code that produces dynamic behavior in HTML forms. These examples not only demonstrate the primary benefit of the technique – a more interactive user interface – but also show the secondary benefits: reduced load on both the web-server and web-client computers...|$|R

5000|$|In 1863, Edward A. Calahan {{invented a}} stock ticker and formed the Gold and Stock Telegraph Company in 1867 {{to exploit the}} technology. Gold and Stock also {{developed}} a messenger system that sent instructions {{to and from the}} stock exchange floor. Three years later, the president of Gold and Stock Telegraph Company woke up to a burglar in his home, which inspired him to create a telegraph-based alert system. This system eventually connected 50 of his neighbors to a central station where all the <b>alert</b> <b>boxes</b> were monitored. There were many small telegraph delivery companies in the United States in the 19th century. In 1874, 57 district telegraph delivery companies affiliated and became [...] "American District Telegraph". With the increase in telephone usage in the late 19th century, ADT's messenger business slowly declined in popularity. ADT tried branching out and developing their signaling business, while still maintaining their telegraph business as primary income source. ADT incorporated into Western Union in 1901 and separated its messenger business from its main signaling business at that time. In 1909, Western Union and ADT came under the control of American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T). ADT began to expand into new areas, such as fire alarms and security alarms between 1910 and 1930, but was kept separate from AT&T's Holmes alarm business. ADT became a publicly owned company in the 1960s.|$|R

5000|$|System File Protection: First {{introduced}} with Windows 2000 (as Windows File Protection), {{and expanding}} on the capabilities introduced with System File Checker in Windows 98, System File Protection aimed to protect system files from modification and corruption silently and automatically. When the file protection is in effect, replacing or deleting a system file causes Windows ME to silently restore the original copy. The original {{is taken from}} a hard drive backup folder (...) or from the Windows ME installation CD, if the cached copy of files on the hard disk has been deleted. If no installation CD is in the drive, a dialog <b>box</b> <b>alerts</b> the user about the problem and requests that the CD be inserted. System File Protection is a different technology from System Restore {{and should not be}} confused with the latter. System Restore maintains a broad set of changed files including added applications and user configuration data stored repeatedly at specific points in time restored by the user, whereas System File Protection protects operating system files with no user input.|$|R
40|$|Each year, {{three or}} four Mn/DOT snowplows suffer bridge/box {{collisions}} while plowing. These collisions can shear off the box and frame damage to the truck. The box then falls onto the road surface where it becomes an immediate life-threatening hazard to traffic. In some cases, {{the integrity of the}} bridge may also be compromised. A typical collision of this type requires expenditures of $ 30, 000 to $ 40, 000 and results in potentially dangerous delays in achieving clean pavement status along the affected snowplowing route. Feasibility of linking on-board GPS technology for Automatic Vehicle Location with the current bridge information database at Mn/DOT, “BrInfo,” will be investigated, on a plow-route by route basis, to create collision maps. Collision avoidance then will use some primitive form of map matching. In addition, a prototype warning system that serves as a bridge proximity sensor will be developed to alert the snow plow driver that he/she is approaching a bridge with the box at a dangerous height. This warning system is integrated in an on-board box position sensor so that the driver can be <b>alerted</b> that the <b>box</b> must immediately be lowered. While realizing that additional means for box height control may complicate snowplow maintenance, any system that relieves the driver of cognitive overload, to reduce driver stress and fatigue during plowing operating, when running extended rural plow routes, needs to be implemented...|$|R
