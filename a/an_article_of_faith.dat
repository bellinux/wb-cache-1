He also issued an encyclical, Le pèlerinage de Lourdes, on the one-hundredth {{anniversary of the}} apparitions in 1958. John Paul II visited Lourdes three times during his Pontificate, and twice before as a Bishop.|$|E

25|$|The Calendar for May by Pseudo-Jacquemart. (fol.3r) is {{an example}} of {{iconography}} first used by Jean Pucelle in the Belleville Breviary. Each month of the year shows an apostle, representative of the New Testament, and a prophet of the Old Testament. The prophet submits a veiled prophecy which is explained by the apostle as <b>an</b> <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith,</b> while simultaneously, the prophet gives the apostle a stone from the synagogue, which as the months progress is reduced to a ruin.|$|E
25|$|However, the First Cause {{does not}} {{necessarily}} have to be temporally the first. Thus, {{the question of whether}} or not the universe can be imagined as eternal was fiercely debated in the Middle Ages. The University of Paris's condemnation of 1270 denounced the belief that the world is eternal. Aquinas' intellectual rival, Bonaventure, held that the temporality of the universe is demonstrable by reason. Aquinas' position was that the temporality of the world is <b>an</b> <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith,</b> and not demonstrable by reason; though one could reasonably conclude either that the universe is temporal or eternal.|$|E
25|$|One {{of these}} movements, Mahdism, {{was founded in}} the late nineteenth century. It has been likened to a {{religious}} order, {{but it is not a}} tariqa in the traditional sense. Mahdism and its adherents, the Ansar, sought the regeneration of Islam, and in general were critical of the turuq. Muhammad Ahmad ibn as Sayyid Abd Allah, a faqih, proclaimed himself to be al-Mahdi al-Muntazar ("the awaited guide in the right path"), the messenger of God and representative of the Prophet Muhammad, an assertion that became <b>an</b> <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> among the Ansar. He was sent, he said, to prepare the way for the second coming of the Prophet Isa (Jesus) and the impending end of the world. In anticipation of Judgment Day, it was essential that the people return to a simple and rigorous, even puritanical Islam (see Mahdiyah). The idea of the coming of a Mahdi has roots in Sunni Islamic traditions. The issue for Sudanese and other Muslims was whether Muhammad Ahmad was in fact the Mahdi.|$|E

In the UK, the LP achieved number two, spending 12 weeks on the charts with the single peaking at number 8. The album was lavishly produced and packaged, and its dominant message was Harrison's Hindu beliefs. In Greene's opinion it [...] "contained many of the strongest compositions of his career". Stephen Holden, writing in Rolling Stone, felt the album was [...] "vastly appealing" [...] and [...] "profoundly seductive", and that it stood [...] "alone as <b>an</b> <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith,</b> miraculous in its radiance". Other reviewers were less enthusiastic, describing the release as awkward, sanctimonious and overly sentimental, a reaction that left Harrison despondent.|$|E

2500|$|Summoned {{to answer}} to the Privy Council and archbishop—who were {{primarily}} concerned with Hooper's willingness to accept the royal supremacy, which was {{also part of the}} oath for newly ordained clergy—Hooper evidently made sufficient reassurances, as he was soon appointed to the bishopric of Gloucester. Hooper declined the office, however, because of the required vestments and oath by the saints. The king accepted Hooper's position, but the Privy Council did not. Called before them on 15 May 1550, a compromise was reached. Vestments were to be considered a matter of adiaphora, or Res Indifferentes ("things indifferent", as opposed to <b>an</b> <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith),</b> and Hooper could be ordained without them at his discretion, but he must allow that others could wear them. Hooper passed confirmation of the new office again before the king and council on 20 July 1550 when the issue was raised again, and Cranmer was instructed that Hooper was not to be charged [...] "with an oath burdensome to his conscience".|$|E
