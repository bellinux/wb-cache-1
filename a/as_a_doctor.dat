5|$|Neil Hamilton Fairley {{was born}} in Inglewood, Victoria, on 15 July 1891, as the third of six sons of James Fairley, a bank manager, and his wife Margaret Louisa, née Jones. All of their four sons who survived to {{adulthood}} took up medicine as a career. One qualified <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Doctor</b> of Medicine at the University of Melbourne and an FRCS in England and became a surgeon; he was later killed in action in the First World War. A second also qualified <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Doctor</b> of Medicine at the University of Melbourne, and later as an FRACP and FRCP; he became senior physician at Royal Melbourne Hospital. A third son became a general practitioner.|$|E
5|$|On a {{personal}} level, Grace was still unqualified <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> {{and had a}} growing family to support, his daughter Bessie being born in May. When not playing cricket, he had to study a backlog of medical theory. He did not qualify <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> {{until the end of}} the following year. He then needed a practice and this was effectively purchased for him by MCC in 1878 after they launched a National Testimonial on his behalf, though the underlying and hopeful purpose of the appeal was to terminate Grace's embarrassing mercenary activity.|$|E

5|$|Junior doctors {{usually have}} these {{acquired}} memories erased {{as soon as}} possible. However, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> rises up through the hospital hierarchy, and if its mind proves to be sufficiently stable, it may find itself the permanent recipient {{of one or more}} tapes. Diagnosticians, the medical elite of Sector General, can have as many as ten different tapes active at one time, as they may have to supervise treatment of many species at the same time.|$|E

5|$|W. Somerset Maugham (1874– 1965) was a British playwright, {{novelist and}} short story writer.

5|$|After {{returning}} to Puerto Rico in 1859, Betances established {{a very successful}} surgery and ophthalmology practice in Mayagüez. Even fierce political enemies such as Spanish pro-monarchy journalist José Pérez Morís regarded Betances as the best surgeon in Puerto Rico at the time. His good reputation in Puerto Rico would survive his stay in the island nation for many years. In 1895, while Betances was living in Paris, the manufacturers of the Emulsión de Scott (a codfish liver oil product that is still sold today, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline in modern times), paid an endorsement fee to Betances to have him appear on advertisements on Spanish language magazines and newspapers all over New York City and the Caribbean, based on his solid reputation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor.</b>|$|E
5|$|As he grew older, Sadler {{generally}} {{remained in}} good health, {{with the exception}} of a condition that led to the removal of an eye. He died on April 26, 1969, at 93 years of age. Christensen recalls that Sadler was visited by friends and family while on his deathbed; he spoke to them of his confidence in a joyful life after death. He received a full-column obituary in the Chicago Tribune, which discussed his success <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> but not his association with The Urantia Book.|$|E

5|$|At fifteen, Stojanović {{became an}} activist {{in a group}} of student {{organizations}} called Young Bosnia, which strongly opposed Austria-Hungary's occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In 1912, Stojanović was inducted into Narodna Odbrana, an association founded in Serbia with the goal of organizing guerrilla resistance to Bosnia-Herzegovina's annexation by Austria-Hungary. Stojanović was arrested by the Austro-Hungarian authorities in July 1914, and although he was sentenced to 16 years' imprisonment, he was pardoned in 1917. He graduated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Doctor</b> of Medicine after World War I, and in 1929, opened a private practice in the town of Prijedor. In September 1940, he {{became a member of the}} Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ).|$|E
5|$|Chapman {{was born}} in Leicester and was raised in Melton Mowbray. He enjoyed science, acting, and comedy, and after graduating from Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and St Bartholomew's Medical College, he turned down a career <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> to be a comedian. Chapman {{eventually}} established a writing partnership with John Cleese, which reached its critical peak with Monty Python in the 1970s. Chapman subsequently left Britain for Los Angeles, where he attempted {{to be a success}} on American television, speaking on the college circuit and producing the pirate film Yellowbeard, before returning to Britain in the early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Despite the show's success, Chapman {{was still}} unsure about abandoning his medical career. In {{between the two}} series of At Last the 1948 Show he {{completed}} his studies at St Bartholomew's, and became professionally registered <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor.</b> Chapman and Cleese also wrote for the long-running television comedy series Doctor in the House, and both appeared on a one-off television special, How to Irritate People alongside Brooke-Taylor and Michael Palin. One of Cleese and Chapman's sketches, featuring a used car salesman refusing to believe a customer's model had broken down, became {{the inspiration for the}} Dead Parrot sketch. Chapman also co-wrote several episodes of Doctor in the House follow up, Doctor in Charge, with Bernard McKenna.|$|E

Bucquet's spy film The Adventures of Tartu, {{the first of many}} roles <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor.</b> Comfort hired him again the following year to appear alongside James Mason, Lucie Mannheim and Raymond Lovell in Hotel Reserve, a spy film set in a hotel in southern France just before World War II. He then had a small role as Schmidt in Harold French's romantic comedy English Without Tears (1944) alongside Michael Wilding, Margaret Rutherford and Penelope Dudley-Ward.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to practicing <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> for nearly 20 {{years at the}} Colored Orphan Asylum in Manhattan, Smith was a public intellectual: he contributed articles to medical journals, participated in learned societies, and wrote numerous essays and articles drawing from his medical and statistical training. He used his training in medicine and statistics to refute common misconceptions about race, intelligence, medicine, and society in general. Invited as {{a founding member of}} the New York Statistics Society in 1852, which promoted a new science, he was elected as a member in 1854 of the recently founded American Geographic Society. But he was never admitted to the American Medical Association or local medical associations.|$|E
5|$|In his poetry, Chivers {{made use}} of legends and themes from Native American culture, {{particularly}} the Cherokee, though often with Christian overtones. He was also heavily influenced {{by the work of}} François-René de Chateaubriand and Emanuel Swedenborg. Many of Chivers's poems included themes of death and sorrow, often using images of shrouds, coffins, angels, and reunions with lost loves in the afterlife. Religious conventions at the time made discussion of death popular, as was reflected in poetry. Because of his background <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor,</b> Chivers was able to graphically depict the last moments before someone's death.|$|E

Verge's brother, meanwhile, continued to play for University and also played fullback for Metropolitan against the Anglo-Welsh touring team in Sydney on 15 August 1908, which the tourists won 13–16 with a try in the final moments, and against the Ponsonby team on tour from New Zealand in August 1909.
