The interior of the country is difficult to access due to lack of infrastructure, is mostly unsafe for travel, and is wracked constantly by famine and starvation.|$|E
5|$|Richardson's Pamela, the {{prototype}} for the sentimental novel, is a didactic love {{story with a}} happy ending, written at a time women were beginning {{to have the right}} to choose husbands and yet were restricted by social conventions. Austen attempted Richardson's epistolary style, but found the flexibility of narrative more conducive to her realism, a realism in which each conversation and gesture carries a weight of significance. The narrative style utilises free indirect speech – she was the first English novelist to do so extensively – through which she had the ability to present a character's thoughts directly to the reader <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>still</b> retain narrative control. The style allows an author to vary discourse between the narrator's voice and values and those of the characters.|$|E

25|$|The {{background}} to {{this was on}} Nov. 12, when Resorts reached a tentative agreement with certain bondholders, several bondholders petitioned the United States Bankruptcy Court in Camden, New Jersey, to put the company into involuntary bankruptcy to protect legal claims they might have against Trump, the real estate investor Griffin outbid for Resorts the prior year. As a result, this literally wiped out or greatly reduced the investments of the bondholders, so that Mr. Griffin could sue Trump <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>still</b> retain a significant portion for himself.|$|E

Some of the Acme modules are deliberately implemented in amusing ways.

[...] Although these artists all painted similar scenes within the White Mountains, each artist had an individual style that characterized his work. These landscape paintings in the Hudson River tradition, however, eventually fell out of favor with the public, and, {{by the turn of the}} century, the era for White Mountain art had ended.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in Radiohead's Oxford studio, Godrich's studio in Covent Garden, and Yorke's home. Yorke wanted to [...] "approach and engage with computers and not a lot else, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>still</b> have lots of life and energy in the music." [...] To generate ideas, he cut and pasted clips at random from Radiohead's library of original samples, {{many of which were}} created on laptops in hotel rooms as the band toured. He would send sound fragments to Godrich, who identified passages that could become songs, edited them, and returned them to Yorke. Describing the collaborative process, Yorke said: [...] "'Black Swan', back in the day, was a ... nine-minute load of bollocks. Except for this one juicy bit, and [...] goes past and goes, 'That bit. Fuck the rest.' Usually it's something like that." ...|$|E
500|$|Allschools writer Björn, {{mentioned}} that the band did the album [...] "really well and mosh like crazy", despite adding that the growls [...] "suffered, grieved [...] sometimes a little desperate". Fake Train reviewer Ken Hawk said the album was maybe [...] "one of the best fusions of metallic hardcore and melodic punk-rock", continuing with how the band were able to [...] "spring back-and-forth between booming chugga mosh breakdowns, melodic guitar thrashing, and driving upbeat rock…flawlessly" [...] in an easy manner. Scene It All's Anson said the band [...] "finally succeeded in rightfully earning that title" [...] of [...] "bridg the gap between hardcore and emo". McKinnon's voice was praised as using [...] "his voice extremely well [...] He manages to give the lowest screams <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>still</b> can hit the highest notes {{when it comes to}} singing.

500|$|Nimoy called Megan Parlen [...] "phenomenal" [...] in {{her role}} as the young Ro, and {{compared}} her to Christina Ricci. Taylor also praised Parlen, calling her fantastic in the role. Because of the expectation that Forbes would not return to the role of Ro after [...] "Rascals", Taylor suggested at one point keeping the character as a child since her return to adulthood was not seen on screen. She suggested it to Piller and Berman, but said that they looked as if what she said was [...] "absolutely insane". Taylor said it remained a good idea, as she felt that only Star Trek could have a character changed into the body of the child <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>still</b> fly the ship.

500|$|The {{television}} critic Julia Raeside {{discussed the}} unusual style of [...] "Cold Comfort", saying that [...] "You could argue [...] {{are at the}} stage in their careers where they don't need to experiment. No one else makes television like them <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>still</b> they push themselves." [...] For Clare Murphy, writing in the Daily Mirror, the episode [...] "makes great use of CCTV split-screen footage". Dessau said that the set-up gave the episode [...] "its haunting flavour". Viewers do not just see Andy, but also streams from other cameras, which, for Dessau, [...] "makes the viewer both intrigued and anxious". Boyd, too, claimed that the episode played on the [...] "inherent creepiness" [...] of CCTV footage. She said that the split-screen set-up increased the tension, and that the [...] "gimmick is a good one"; though it could [...] "have worked well as a pleasing novelty on its own, [...] also makes this 'whodunit'/'who's doing it' a refreshingly inventive take on the genre".|$|E
500|$|Trumbull and Dykstra {{found the}} Magicam models problematic. The Klingon cruiser's {{lighting}} was so dim {{that there was}} no way to make them bright enough on film. As Trumbull also felt the Enterprises lights were ill-suited for his needs, he rewired both models. He questioned that the Enterprise could be traveling years from any source of light <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>still</b> be fully illuminated. Instead of having the ship completely dark save for viewports, Trumbull came up with a system of self-illumination; he pictured the ship as something like an oceanliner, [...] "a grand lady of the seas at night". A similar method was used on the Klingon cruiser model, but he made it less well-lit to convey a different look than the clean visuals of the Federation—the cruiser was meant to evoke [...] "an enemy submarine in World War II that's been out at sea for too long". The models were filmed in multiple passes and composited together in post-production; multiple passes with only the model's lighting running were added to the original pass for the final look. The Klingon cruiser sequence was developed to avoid an opening similar to Star Wars, with one model used for all three seen in the film.|$|E

2500|$|... the historiography {{of modern}} Wales was rather narrow.

2500|$|Bakhita's {{legacy is}} that {{transformation}} is possible through suffering. Her story of deliverance from physical slavery also symbolizes {{all those who}} find meaning and inspiration in her life for their own deliverance from spiritual slavery.

2500|$|Fantasy {{is also a}} {{relationship}} with the world and with others by proxy. It is a substitute relationship, but {{a relationship}} nonetheless, characterized by idealized, defensive and compensatory mechanisms. This is self-contained and free from the dangers and anxieties associated with emotional connection to real persons and situations. Klein explains it as [...] "an expression of the self struggling to connect to objects, albeit internal objects. Fantasy permits schizoid patients to feel connected, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>still</b> free from the imprisonment in relationships. In short, in fantasy one can be attached (to internal objects) and still be free." [...] This aspect of schizoid pathology has been generously elaborated in works by Laing, Winnicott, and Klein.|$|E
