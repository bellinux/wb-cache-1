5|$|If a {{cerebral}} <b>aneurysm</b> {{is identified}} on angiography, two measures {{are available to}} reduce the risk of further bleeding from the same aneurysm: clipping and coiling. Clipping requires a craniotomy (opening of the skull) to locate the <b>aneurysm,</b> followed by the placement of clips around the neck of the <b>aneurysm.</b> Coiling is performed through the large blood vessels (endovascularly): a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery in the groin and advanced through the aorta to the arteries (both carotid arteries and both vertebral arteries) that supply the brain. When the <b>aneurysm</b> has been located, platinum coils are deployed that cause a blood clot to form in the <b>aneurysm,</b> obliterating it. The decision as to which treatment is undertaken is typically made by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a neurosurgeon, neuroradiologist, and often other health professionals.|$|E
5|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{classification scheme}} {{has been suggested}} by Ogilvy and Carter to predict outcome and gauge therapy.

If the bleeding {{is likely to have}} originated from an <b>aneurysm</b> (as determined by the CT scan appearance), the choice is between cerebral angiography (injecting radiocontrast through a catheter to the brain arteries) and CT angiography (visualizing blood vessels with radiocontrast on a CT scan) to identify aneurysms.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Aneurysms</b> on the {{posterior}} circulation, most commonly {{located at the}} basilar top, have {{a higher risk of}} rupture than <b>aneurysms</b> on the anterior circulation. If hemodynamic shear stress, which has its maximum impact at the distal carina of bifurcations, explains the higher rupture rate of basilar top <b>aneurysms,</b> <b>aneurysms</b> {{at the top of the}} carotid artery should have similar rupture rates given their geometrical similarities. AIM: Our purpose was to compare rupture risks of carotid and basilar artery bifurcation <b>aneurysms.</b> METHODS: We included studies from Medline and Embase searches and compared proportions of ruptured and unruptured <b>aneurysms</b> at the basilar and carotid bifurcation with the assumption that carotid <b>aneurysms</b> are twice as prevalent based on the presence of 2 carotid and 1 basilar artery bifurcation on the circle of Willis. Results: Of all unruptured <b>aneurysms,</b> 8. 3 % were located on the basilar and 6. 0 % on the carotid bifurcation; 8. 0 % of all ruptured <b>aneurysms</b> were located on the basilar and 4. 3 % on the carotid bifurcation. Subsequently the ratios of carotid versus basilar <b>aneurysms</b> were 0. 72 for unruptured and 0. 55 for ruptured <b>aneurysms,</b> instead of the expected 2. 0. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Aneurysms</b> are less frequently located on the carotid than on the basilar artery bifurcation. The proportion of ruptured carotid <b>aneurysms</b> is smaller than that of unruptured carotid <b>aneurysms,</b> suggesting a lower rupture risk for <b>aneurysms</b> at the carotid artery bifurcation. The anatomical geometry of the bifurcations and concomitant hemodynamic stress are considered an unlikely explanation for the higher risk of posterior circulation <b>aneurysms...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study is to report the morbidity, mortality, and {{angiographic}} results of coiling of asymptomatic incidental <b>aneurysms</b> and compare the characteristics of these <b>aneurysms</b> with other asymptomatic incidental <b>aneurysms</b> that were not treated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During a 10 -year period, 97 patients without previous subarachnoid hem-orrhage, presented with incidentally found intracranial <b>aneurysms.</b> In 48 patients, 58 <b>aneurysms</b> were coiled. The mean size of the 58 coiled incidental <b>aneurysms</b> was 10. 9 mm (median, 9 mm; range, 3 – 40 mm). Twenty-six of 58 coiled <b>aneurysms</b> (44. 8 %) were 10 mm. RESULTS: Permanent morbidity of coiling was 2. 1 % (1 of 48), mortality was 0 %. Compared with untreated patients with incidental <b>aneurysms,</b> coiled patients were younger and more often had multiple <b>aneurysms.</b> <b>Aneurysms</b> of coiled patients more often had a small neck, were more often located on the carotid artery, and were less often located on the middle cerebral artery. Of 46 <b>aneurysms</b> with angiographic follow up, 45 were completely or near completely occluded. To obtain these results, 3 <b>aneurysms</b> were coiled more than once.

40|$|Background Nowadays, the {{epidemiological}} {{report and}} study about the intracranial <b>aneurysms</b> in young adults are very rare, especially in China. This paper aims {{to investigate the}} epidemiological and imaging features of intracranial <b>aneurysms</b> in young adults with the age of 16 - 29 years old. Methods Clinical data of 2119 patients with intracranial <b>aneurysms</b> admitted from January 2010 to October 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. Results Intracranial <b>aneurysms</b> in young adults (16 - 29 years old) accounted for 1. 93 % of all intracranial <b>aneurysms</b> (41 / 2119) treated in the same period, and the gender ratio (male : female) was 2. 15 : 1. A total of 42 intracranial <b>aneurysms</b> were found in 41 patients, including 35 located in the anterior circulation and 7 in the posterior circulation, of which 13 <b>aneurysms</b> (30. 95 %) in the anterior communicating artery, 6 <b>aneurysms</b> (14. 29 %) each in the middle cerebral artery and the distal of anterior cerebral artery, and 2 <b>aneurysms</b> (4. 76 %) in the posterior communicating artery. There were almost 34 <b>aneurysms</b> (80. 95 %) located in bifurcation of Willis circle and proximal aorta and 8 <b>aneurysms</b> (19. 05 %) in the branches of artery. The diameter of <b>aneurysms</b> were ≤ 5 mm in 19 <b>aneurysms</b> (45. 24 %), 6 - 10 mm in 13 (30. 95 %), 11 - 24 mm in 3 (7. 14 %) and ≥ 25 mm in 7 (16. 67 %). Conclusion Young men are much more susceptible to intracranial <b>aneurysms</b> than young women, but the incidence in women increases as they grow old.

Transient simulations were conducted under patient-specific inlet flow rates measured by phase-contrast magnetic resonance velocimetry. In the postanalyses, we calculated time-averaged wall shear stress (WSS), oscillatory shear index, and relative residence time (RRT). The volume of blood flow entering <b>aneurysms</b> through the neck and the mean velocity of blood flow inside <b>aneurysms</b> were examined. We applied the age-of-fluid method to quantitatively assess the residence of blood inside <b>aneurysms.</b> Atherosclerotic changes coincided with regions exposed to disturbed blood flow, as indicated by low WSS and long RRT.
