A study of He/H around the current sheets has led to a clear distinction between quiescent current sheets at times of low solar activity and <b>active</b> current <b>sheets</b> associated with magnetic clouds (and, presumably, ICMES).

40|$|Understanding {{lithium-ion}} insertion/extraction {{mechanisms in}} battery electrode materials is of crucial importance in developing new materials with better cycling performance. In this thesis, these mechanisms are probed for two different potential cathode materials {{by a combination}} of electrochemical and single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The materials investigated are V 6 O 13 and cubic LiMn 2 O 4 spinel. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies of lithiated phases in the LixV 6 O 13 system (x= 2 / 3 and 1) exhibit superlattice phenomena and an underlying Li+ ion insertion mechanism which involves the stepwise addition of Li+ ions into a two-dimensional array of chemically equivalent sites. Each successive stage in the insertion process is accompanied by a rearrangement of the Li+ ions together with an electron redistribution associated with the reduction of specific V-atoms in the structure. This results in the formation of electrochemically <b>active</b> <b>sheets</b> in the structure. A similar mechanism occurs in the LiMn 2 O 4 delithiation process, whereby lithium is extracted in a layered arrangement, with the Mn atoms forming charge-ordered Mn 3 +/Mn 4 + layers. Lithium-ion insertion/extraction processes in transition-metal oxides would thus seem to occur through an ordered two-dimensional arrangement of lithium ions extending throughout the structure. The lithium ions and the host structure rearrange cooperatively to form superlattices through lithium and transition-metal ion charge-ordering.

We integrate records of surface deformation, subsurface structure and geochronology to investigate active surface deformation over multiple rupture cycles across the Southern Junggar Thrust (SJT) {{in the southern}} Junggar basin, NW China. Fluvial terrace geometries – extracted from a 1 -m digital elevation model – reveal records of surface faulting across a prominent fault scarp. In addition, terraces exhibit progressive folding across fold scarps. Fault and fold scarps are spatially coincident with a surface-emergent SJT splay and subsurface fault bends along the SJT, respectively, constrained by seismic reflection data. We quantify the magnitude of fault slip at depth implied by fold scarps along Holocene-aged terraces. Our method yields results consistent with independent estimates of slip implied by fault scarp relief for the same terraces. Four late Quaternary terrace records are less continuous, preserved only as fold scarps that suggest folding kinematics involving a component of limb rotation. We develop a new method for quantifying fault slip at depth from terrace folds using a mechanical forward modeling approach. Our analysis yields quantitative relations between fold dip and fault slip, allowing us to quantify SJT fault slip from terrace folds from ~ 250 ka- present. SJT fault slip rate has decelerated from ~ 7. 0 mm/yr in the Late Quaternary to ~ 1. 3 mm/yr throughout the Holocene. These results provide new insight into the kinematics of fault-bend folding for natural structures and define new methods to accurately estimate fault slip and slip rates from terrace folds in <b>active</b> thrust <b>sheets...</b>|$|R

The antenna structure {{consists of a}} slot AFSS and an omnidirectional dual-band feed antenna.

Thus by controlling the bias voltages to different columns, the directive beams can be swept in 4 steps covering the whole azimuth plane.

40|$|Most of {{modelling}} work {{to date on}} turbulenceradiation interactions (TRI) {{has been}} based on the so called optically thin uctuation assumption (OTFA), which assumes that uctuations of local properties are uncorrelated from turbulent uctuations of the local radiative intensity. This correlation between absorption coefcient and radiative intensity, neglected by OTFA is commonly termed absorption TRI. A model for absorption TRI is proposed for optically thick eddies, for which the OTFA is highly questionable. For spectral regions with large absorption coefcient, for which non-negligible absorption TRI can be expected, the diffusion approximation is known to be accurate for radiation calculations, and this method is used to extract the absorption TRI. The always important emission TRI are modeled accurately using a hybrid nite volume/PDF method. As the diffusion approximation requires the evaluation of spatial gradients, thin plate smoothing splines in multiple dimensions are used to lter out statistical noise to obtain the needed gradients.

These rotations occurred before the Jaramillo subchron in a time span of, 0. 5 m. y.

Other than bending, existing and conforming, adding stretchability to electronic systems can {{open up a}} new frontier for a myriad of applications. Especially in the medical sector, these stretchable devices can increase the scope of monitoring and ease and comfort of the patient. All kinds of wearable devices can be based on these technologies to augment our daily lives. With the kind of state of art technology available to the common man today, the bar has already been set {{for the performance of}} such devices. Hence, its imperative that these stretchable devices perform at this level and should be capable of adapting to the market to serve the mass requirement. Hence, it becomes inevitable to use metal interconnects to provide very low resistance and easy adhesion to commercial electronic components. Another aspect of such devices is an adhesion ability with which we can attach it to various kinds of surfaces. In this thesis, we propose a new multi-layered PDMS structure approach to bring stretchability in the device. For all kinds of adhesion requirements, various ratios of PDMS: Cross-linker have been used. These different ratios of PDMS: Cross-linker changes the mechanical and adhesive properties of the cured PDMS. Hence, the same material can be used as the stretchable substrate as well as to serve various adhesion requirements. A soft adhesion allows us to attach it to the human body/other surfaces. The adhesion can be tailored to be quite conformal and strong, yet its removal is quite gentle to the skin. A higher curing ratio makes the PDMS very sticky and soft. Aluminum/Copper foils can be directly stuck upon it and tracks can be then etched out to get a printed circuit. Since this adhesive layer is quite soft, it acts as a cushion and reduces the amount of stress transferred to the metal interconnects. Hence, stretchable circuits with metal interconnects can be realized. The electronic components can be then attached upon it via normal soldering techniques/using conductive ink. Various devices that can be built with the proposed techniques have been coined the term CAS (Conformal <b>Active</b> <b>Sheets)</b> to allow easy reference to such kind of devices. Since the substrate is soft, physical handling of such devices becomes an issue as one tries to transfer the circuit pattern.

They are typically formed when the normal component of motional (convective) electric field points toward the embedded current sheet {{on at least one}} of its sides. The core region of an HFA contains hot and highly deflected ion flows and rather low and turbulent magnetic field. In this paper, we report first observations of HFA-like events at Mercury identified over a course of two planetary years.

Together with earlier observations of HFA activity at Earth, Venus and Saturn, our results confirm that hot flow anomalies are a common property of planetary bow shocks, and show that the characteristic size of these events is of the order of one planetary radius.

Our approach has been motivated {{by a desire to}} extend the functionality of the Web with support for multimedia and active documents. Although growing in complexity, HTML is still lacking in functionality. We prefer a more flexible and generic approach, as enabled by the employment of SGML. After a brief introduction of SGML, we will illustrate how our approach accommodates (extensions of) HTML as well as arbitrary SGML documents containing multimedia data such as video and audio. We will then briefly sketch the software components used in the realization of our approach and discuss some topics for further research.
