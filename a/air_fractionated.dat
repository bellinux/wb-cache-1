40|$|New He, Ne, Ar and CO 2 stepped-crushing {{data from}} the Mid-Atlantic Ridge show that {{contamination}} of basalts by atmospheric noble gases involves three or more components: unfractionated <b>air,</b> <b>fractionated</b> air with high 36 Ar/ 22 Ne (45) and fractionated air with low 36 Ar/ 22 Ne (5). In addition, the magmatic noble gases trapped in these basaltic glasses are variably fractionated such that 4 He/ 40 Ar* (where the asterisk indicates corrected for atmospheric contamination based on all 36 Ar being atmospheric in origin) is in the range 3 – 12. Single samples have a range in 4 He/ 40 Ar* with the highest ratios in the final crush steps, consistent with the most fractionated (highest 4 He/ 40 Ar*) volatiles trapped in the smallest vesicles. It {{is not possible to}} distinguish between batch and Rayleigh degassing mechanisms. The complexities of the contamination and magmatic fractionation processes means that {{it is not possible to}} estimate 40 Ar/ 36 Ar of the mantle source to these basalts other than it must be higher than the highest ratio measured (26, 200 ± 5200). Noble gas/CO 2 ratios are also variable. While some CO 2 adsorption during crushing exaggerates the variations in He/CO 2 and Ar/CO 2, we show that it is not possible to account for the entire variation as an analytical artefact: some of the variation is present in the vesicles. Variations in He/CO 2 cannot be attributed to solubility controlled degassing because of the broadly similar solubilities of He and CO 2 in tholeiitic magmas. The large range in He/CO 2 in these glasses (factor of 10) is not accompanied by indications of major changes in melting regime or source region chemistry, therefore is thought to reflect late-stage (magmatic) fractionation of CO 2 from the noble gases. It is not possible to identify an explicit mechanism, although both CO 2 reduction (e. g., to hydrocarbons or graphite) and kinetic CO 2 -noble gas fractionation could account for the variations...|$|E

40|$|Carbon {{capture and}} storage (CCS) {{is the only}} {{currently}} available technology that can directly reduce anthropogenic CO 2 emissions arising from fossil fuel combustion. Monitoring and verification of CO 2 stored in geological reservoirs will be a regulatory requirement and so the development of reliable monitoring techniques is essential. The isotopic and trace gas composition - the inherent fingerprint - of captured CO 2 streams is a potentially powerful, low cost geochemical technique for tracking the fate of injected gas in CCS projects; carbon and oxygen isotopes, in particular, {{have been used as}} geochemical tracers in a number of pilot CO 2 storage sites, and noble gases are known to be powerful tracers of natural CO 2 migration. However, the inherent tracer fingerprint in captured CO 2 streams has yet to be robustly investigated and documented and key questions remain, including how consistent is the fingerprint, what controls it, and will it be retained en route to and within the storage reservoir? Here we present the first systematic measurements of the carbon and oxygen isotopes and the trace noble gas composition of anthropogenic CO 2 captured from combustion power stations and fertiliser plants. The analysed CO 2 is derived from coal, biomass and natural gas feedstocks, using amine capture, oxyfuel and gasification processes, from six different CO 2 capture plants spanning four different countries. We find that δ 13 C values are primarily controlled by the δ 13 C of the feedstock while δ 18 O values are predominantly similar to atmospheric O 2. Noble gases are of low concentration and exhibit relative element abundances different to expected reservoir baselines and air, with isotopic compositions that are similar to <b>air</b> or <b>fractionated</b> <b>air.</b> The use of inherent tracers for monitoring and verification was provisionally assessed by analysing CO 2 samples produced from two field storage sites after CO 2 injection. These experiments at Otway, Australia, and Aquistore, Canada, highlight the need for reliable baseline data. Noble gas data indicates noble gas stripping of the formation water and entrainment of Kr and Xe from an earlier injection experiment at Otway, and inheritance of a distinctive crustal radiogenic noble gas fingerprint at Aquistore. This fingerprint can be used to identify unplanned migration of the CO 2 to the shallow subsurface or surface...|$|R
40|$|Sample preparation, {{involving}} {{physical and}} chemical methods, is an unavoidable step in geochemical analysis. From a noble gas perspective, the two important effects are loss of sample gas and/or incorporation of air, which are significant sources of analytical artifacts. This article reports {{on the effects of}} sample exposure to laboratory air without mechanical influence and during sample grinding. The experiments include pure adsorption on terrestrial analog materials (gibbsite and olivine) and grinding of Martian meteorites. A consistent observation is the presence of an elementally <b>fractionated</b> <b>air</b> component in the samples studied. This is a critical form of terrestrial contamination in meteorites as it often mimics the heavy noble gas signatures of known extra-terrestrial end-members that are the basis of important conclusions about the origin and evolution of a meteorite. Although the effects of such contamination can be minimized by avoiding elaborate sample preparation protocols, caution should be exercised in interpreting the elemental ratios (Ar/Xe, Kr/Xe), especially in the low-temperature step extractions. The experiments can also be transferred to the investigation of Martian meteorites with long terrestrial residence times, and to Mars, where the Mars Science Laboratory mission will be able to measure noble gas signatures in the current atmosphere and in rocks and soils collected on the surface in Gale crater...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{formation}} of an excess of dissolved gas (“excess air”) in quasi-saturated media was studied by analyzing and interpreting dissolved noble gas concentrations in laboratory column experiments. Using quartz sand filled columns of 1 m length, two different experimental designs were realized. In the first, groundwater recharge was simulated by a unidirectional vertical water flow through the columns. In the second, groundwater level fluctuations in an aquifer zone without active infiltration were reproduced by cyclic water level fluctuations in the columns. The reproducible generation of excess air under these defined, near natural conditions was successful. Partial or complete dissolution of air bubbles entrapped in the quartz sand could be identified as the mechanism responsible for the generation of excess air. Depending on the experimental design, supersaturation of the dissolved atmospheric noble gases ranging between 1. 4 % Ne and 16. 2 % Ne was found. The measured noble gas patterns were interpreted using inverse modeling and conceptual gas exchange models and were compared to results of numerical simulations of gas bubble dissolution in water filled soil columns. The gas composition {{in most of the}} samples resembles either unfractionated pure atmospheric excess <b>air</b> or is <b>fractionated</b> in accordance with closed-system equilibration between entrapped air and surrounding water. In addition to the amount of entrapped air, the hydrostatic pressure exerted on the entrapped air bubbles is the dominating parameter responsible for the total amount o...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In recent years, {{because of}} the {{presence}} of industrial factories around the Isfahan province of Iran and high concentrations of heavy metals in the vicinity of them, and the gradual accumulation of heavy metals from various sources of pollution in urban areas over time, including gasoline combustion, and use of urban waste compost and sewage sludge as fertilizer, there has been widespread concerned regarding the human health problems with increasing heavy metals in soils around the Isfahan city. The variation of composition in the soil matrix may lead to variation of composition and behavior of soil heavy metals. Soil is a heterogeneous body of materials and soil components are obviously in interaction. Studies tacking this complexity often use aggregate measurements as surrogates of the complex soil matrix. So, it is important the understanding soil particle-size distribution of aggregates and its effects on heavy metal partitioning among the size fractions, the fate of metals and their toxicity potential in the soil environment. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the Cu release potential from different size fractions of different polluted soils by different extractants and their availability for corn plant. Materials and Methods: Five soil samples were collected from the surface soils (0 – 15 cm) of Isfahan province, in central of Iran. The soil samples were air-dried and ground to pass a 2 -mm sieve for laboratory analysis. <b>Air</b> dried samples <b>fractionated</b> into four different aggregate size fractions 2. 0 – 4. 0 (large macro-aggregate), 0. 25 – 2 (small macro-aggregate), 0. 05 – 0. 25 (micro-aggregate), an...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{exterior and}} interior subsamples from the Martian shergottite meteorites Allan Hills (ALH) A 77005 and Roberts Massif (RBT) 04261 for secondary minerals, oxygen isotopes, Ar-Ar, and noble gas signatures. Electron microprobe investigations revealed that RBT 04261 does not contain any visible alteration even in its most exterior fractures, whereas fracture fillings in ALHA 77005 penetrate into the meteorite up to 300 μm, beyond which the fractures are devoid of secondary minerals. Light noble gases seem to be almost unaffected by terrestrially induced alteration in both meteorites. Thus, a shock metamorphic overprint of 30 – 35 GPa can be deduced from the helium measurements in RBT 04261. Oxygen isotopes also seem unaffected by terrestrially weathering and variations can easily be reconciled with the differences in modal mineralogy of the {{exterior and interior}} subsamples. The measurements on irradiated samples (Ar-Ar) showed a clear Martian atmospheric contribution in ALHA 77005, but this is less apparent in our sample of RBT 04261. Exterior and interior subsamples show slight differences in apparent ages, but the overall results are very similar between the two. In contrast, krypton and xenon are severely affected by terrestrial contamination, demonstrating the ubiquitous presence of elementally <b>fractionated</b> <b>air</b> in RBT 04261. Although seemingly contradictory, our results indicate that RBT 04261 was more affected by contamination than ALHA 77005. We conclude that irrespective of on which planet the alteration occurred, exposure of Martian rocks to atmosphere (or brine) introduces noble gases with signatures elementally fractionated relative to the respective atmospheric composition into the rock, and relationships of that process with oxygen isotopes or mineralogical observations are not straightforward...|$|R
40|$|Assessment of soil {{organic carbon}} (SOC) {{sequestration}} potential of reclaimed minesoils (RMS) {{is important for}} preserving environmental quality and increasing agronomic yields. The mechanism of physical SOC sequestration is achieved by encapsulation of SOC in spaces within macro and microaggregates. The experimental sites, owned and maintained by American Electrical Power, were characterized by distinct age chronosequences of reclaimed minesoils and were located in Guernsey, Morgan, Noble, and Muskingum Counties of Ohio. These sites were reclaimed both with and without topsoil application, and were under continuous grass or forest cover. In this report results are presented from the sites reclaimed in 1994 (R 94 -F), in 1987 (R 87 -G), in 1982 (R 82 -F), in 1978 (R 78 -G), in 1969 (R 69 -F), in 1956 (R 56 -G), and from the unmined control (UMS-G). Three sites are under continuous grass cover and three under forest cover since reclamation. The samples were <b>air</b> dried and <b>fractionated</b> using a wet sieving technique into macro (> 2. 0 mm), meso (0. 25 - 2. 0 mm) and microaggregates (0. 053 - 0. 25 mm).

Soil C and N concentrations were higher at the forest sites compared to the grass sites in each aggregate fraction for both depths.

40|$|Meteorite “finds” {{from the}} {{terrestrial}} hot deserts {{have become a}} major contributor to the inventory of Martian meteorites. In order to understand their nitrogen and noble gas components, we have carried out stepped heating experiments on samples from two Martian meteorites collected from hot deserts. We measured interior and surface bulk samples, glassy and non-glassy portions of Dar al Gani 476 and Sayh al Uhaymir 005. We have also analyzed noble gases released from the Antarctic shergottite Lewis Cliff 88516 by crushing and stepped heating. For the hot desert meteorites significant terrestrial Ar, Kr, Xe contamination is observed, with an elementally <b>fractionated</b> <b>air</b> (EFA) component dominating the low temperature releases. The extremely low Ar/Kr/Xe ratios of EFA {{may be the result of}} multiple episodes of trapping/loss during terrestrial alteration involving aqueous fluids. We suggest fractionation processes similar to those in hot deserts to have acted on Mars, with acidic weathering on the latter possibly even more effective in producing elementally fractionated components. Addition from fission xenon is apparent in DaG 476 and SaU 005. The Ar–Kr–Xe patterns for LEW 88516 show trends as typically observed in shergottites – including evidence for a crush-released component similar to that observed in EETA 79001. A trapped Ne component most prominent in the surface sample of DaG 476 may represent air contamination. It is accompanied by little trapped Ar (20 Ne/ 36 Ar > 50) and literature data suggest its presence also in some Antarctic finds. Data for LEW 88516 and literature data, on the other hand, suggest the presence of two trapped Ne components of Martian origin characterized by different 20 Ne/ 22 Ne, possibly related to the atmosphere and the interior. Caution is recommended in interpreting nitrogen and noble gas isotopic signatures of Martian meteorites from hot deserts in terms of extraterrestrial sources and processes. Nevertheless our results provide hope that vice-versa, via noble gases and nitrogen in meteorites and other relevant samples from terrestrial deserts, Martian secondary processes can be studied...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: : A {{variety of}} {{processes}} {{have been considered}} possibly contributing volatiles, including the noble gases, to the terrestrial planets (e. g., [1 - 3]). Special consideration {{has been given to}} the concept of accretion of volatilerich materials by the forming planets. This might include infalling extraterrestrial material of various sizes, i. e. from planetesimals down to dust, and could include material from the outer asteroid belt, as well as material of cometary origin. Currently, the dominant source of extraterrestrial material accreted by the Earth is represented by micrometeorites (MMs) with sizes mostly in the 100 - 400 μm range [3, 4]), and according to [3] accretion of early micrometeorites may have {{played a major role in}} the formation of the terrestrial atmosphere and oceans. We have therefore set out to investigate in more detail the complete inventory of noble gases in MMs. Here we summarize some of the results we obtained on MMs collected in micrometeorite traps on the tops of the Transantarctic Mountains [5]. Trapped noble gases: Concentrations in “unmelted” MMs, in the size range 400 - 1000 μm, are compared to those in CM meteorites (exemplified by CM 2 Maribo) in Figure 1. While He has been largely lost, the abundance of Ne often exceeds that in CMs, because of higher abundances of trapped solar wind Ne. Ar, Kr, Xe are somewhat lower and quite variable. This is in line with our mineralogical observations on separate pieces of the analyzed MMs that mostly show similarities to ordinary chondrites of various types rather than CMs - contrary to the situation for recently fallen MMs recovered from ice and snow of Central Antarctica [6, 7]. Note, though, that uncertainty is induced by a) the fact that the MMs are often not homogeneous in composition and b) the complex interaction during passage through the terrestrial atmosphere. Among others, we found in several cases (two scoriaceous, one unmelted) Kr and Xe showing the signature of isotopically <b>fractionated</b> <b>air</b> with the heavier isotopes enriched [8]. abundance relative to Maribo 2 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 100 101 45 b unmelted 45 c unmelted 45 c. 29 4 He 20 Ne 36 Ar 84 Kr 132 Xe Fig. 1. Trapped noble gas abundances in nominally unmelted TAM MMs, normalized to CM Maribo [9]. Two fragments of the special MM 45 c 29 are shown. In addition, for an aliquout of one of the plotted MMs as well as for one additional “unmelted” MM abundances were below detection limit. Cosmic ray exposure: Neon is generally dominated by fractionated solar wind, but cosmogenic contributions are apparent in a number of cases. Cosmogenic noble gases can be used to infer cosmic ray exposure and (due to the Poynting-Robertson effect) the distance from the sun where particles (or dusts) began their journey to the inner Solar System [10]. In addition the isotopic composition of cosmogenic Ne contains information about irradiation conditions. From a comparison with model predictions [10] it follows that data for the MMs with the clearest cosmogenic signature are incompatible with irradiation by galactic cosmic rays (GCR) as small particles. Precursors of MMs could have been exposed to GCR as part of a larger body or to solar cosmic rays (SCR) as small particles. In the latter case a SCR energy spectrum is required that is softer than the one favored in [10]. 45 c 29 : This MM is characterized by several unique features: a) high abundances not only of cosmogenic Ne but also cosmogenic Ar, with extremely low cosmogenic 21 Ne/ 38 Ar in one analyzed aliquot, but less so in a second specimen, attesting to an inhomogeneous composition; b) evidence for radiogenic 129 Xe and fission Xe from 244 Pu. These properties are similar to, but not identical in all details, to achondrites or Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs). Since for MMs derived from beyond 4 a. u. the GCR contribution should exceed that from SCR [10], the high abundance of cosmogenic Ne is difficult to reconcile with its isotopic composition...|$|R
40|$|The present study, {{realized}} {{within the}} framework of the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) SPP (Special Priority Program) 1385 "The First 10 Million Years of the Solar System - a Planetary Materials Approach", addresses the proposition of analyzing micrometeorites (MMs) (sizes of 50 μm - 1 mm) on their noble gas content along with their isotopic composition. The experimental studies and the dissertation was performed at the Max-Planck-Institute for Chemistry in Mainz in collaboration with the Heidelberg University since 2010. In particular, the similarities and differences of MMs to larger meteorites were studied. Also of interest was the thermal history of MMs along with changes in their noble gas inventory while passing Earth's atmosphere. In our study we focused on xenon especially in unmelted MMs. This required the operation of a special version of a noble gas mass spectrometer (MS) which in this case was the "Noblesse" from Nu Instruments. Continuous care and optimization of the measurement methods were essential. The specialty of this device is the ion-counting multicollector system for especially high sensitivity and detection of small amounts of noble gases. Worldwide there is only one more device of this type, at Washington University, St. Louis (USA), where, among other things, the solar wind noble gases of the Genesis mission have been determined. Two different groups of micrometeorites were examined. Firstly MMs collected from a geological trap on top of the Miller Butte ridge, in the area of the Transantarctic Mountains. These micrometeorites were spotted and collected by Luigi Folco, Pierre Rochette and colleagues during a PNRA mission (see Rochette et al. (2008)). The MMs are relatively large (250 - 1000 μm), they sometimes show weathering and were deposited for probably about 1 Ma. In October 2010, with kind cooperation of Luigi Folco, Carole Cordier and Matthias van Ginneken, 103 particles of 51 micrometeorites (MMs) were selected for the noble gas measurements. These MMs consist of the following three main groups - "Cosmic spherules - CS " (more or less glass spherules caused by complete melting of unmelted MMs), "scoriaceous MMs - ScMMs" (partially molten MMs) and "unmelted MMs - UnMMs. The melting processes are caused by the entry and passage of these small extraterrestrial particles through the Earth's atmosphere. The second group of MMs originated from the snow of the central region of Antarctica (Dome C (DC) - CONCORDIA Collection (see Duprat et al. (2007)) and from Cap Prudhomme (CP) (Maurette et al. (1991)). These particles were extracted and collected by melting snow of the Dome C area and are particularly small. The MMs are deposited only for a short time period (a few decades), thus are "fresh" and relatively unweathered. In November 2010, samples of these MMs were provided with kind support by Jean Duprat, Cécile Engrand and Michel Maurette (University of South-Paris, on the campus in Orsay, France). We were able to acquire a total of 50 MM particles from 28 different MMs. Among them were crystalline (Xtal), fine-grained unmelted and carbonaceous (FgC) and partially molten (Sc) micrometeorites. Before the first MM measurements were carried out, the measuring facility was tested on reliability and accuracy by using small particles of larger meteorites. We gradually degassed the MMs by using a 30 W CO 2 -Laser system. For a complete degassing a power of 1 W was sufficient in most cases. After extraction, the inert gases were partitioned in He + Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe fractions. Furthermore, Ar, Kr and Xe were adsorbed at a cold trap filled with active charcoal. Then the noble gases successively were analyzed using the "Noblesse". The sample measurements were supplemented by "blank" and calibration measurements. A total of 29 particles of 25 different TAM MMs and 11 particles of a total of 10 different DC and CP MMs were measured. For most of the particles we were able release sufficient noble gas quantities. However, in particular the very strongly melted "Cosmic spherules " and some of the less melted "scoriaceous MMs" showed clear signs of pre-degassing, probably through the interaction with the Earth's atmosphere. The MMs of Dome C and Cap Prudhomme are very small, but, however, the vast majority of these samples shows high noble gas concentrations compared to the TAM MMs. Measured 3 He/ 4 He ratios were between 0. 9 x 10 - 4 and 149 x 10 - 4 for the TAM MMs and between 3 x 10 - 4 and 50 x 10 - 4 for the MMs of DC and CP, although sometimes with accompanied large uncertainties. Part of the TAM UnMMs and the DC MMs showed a composition in the range between solar wind (SW) and fractionated solar wind ("FSW"). The other (slightly more abundant) part showed - beside SW - significant signs of cosmogenic 3 He contributions. Also in neon, most of the Un- and ScMMs clearly showed signs of solar wind and spallogenic contributions, the latter especially within the TAM MMs 45 c. 29, 45 b. 17 and 45 b. 08. Here, not surprisingly, in particular the CS and ScMMs show clear traces of Earth's atmosphere records. The highest measured concentrations for solar 20 Ne in the TAM MMs were measured in UnMM X 1 (3. 5 x 10 - 6 cc/g), whereas in the case of MMs from DC and CP this was DC 06 _ 09 _ 149 with 8. 0 x 10 - 5 cc/g. The DC values are in the range of what has been found for Dome Fuji MMs measured by Osawa and Nagao (2002). The values for the TAM MMs are significantly lower. The fact that for most TAM and DC/CP MMs the 40 Ar/ 36 Ar ratios are considerable lower than in air (40 Ar/ 36 Ar = 298. 56; Lee et al. (2006)) suggests that these samples include extraterrestrial primordial Ar. Air contamination was indeed detectable, but except for 40 Ar usually negligible. The lowest 40 Ar/ 36 Ar of 2. 0 ± 1. 8 was found for TAM UnMM 45 c. 33 (1). The next lowest value, with a much smaller uncertainty is that of TAM MM 45 c. 35 (3), with 4. 1 ± 0. 1. In the same context the low 38 Ar/ 36 Ar ratio of 0. 185 ± 0. 002 indicates a high proportion of the planetary component "Q(P 1) ". This component is detected in higher concentrations in carbonaceous chondrites. The same is true for the crystalline Dome C MM DC 06 _ 09 _ 149 which shows 40 Ar/ 36 Ar = 5. 62 and 38 Ar/ 36 Ar = 0. 186. Krypton in extraterrestrial samples typically shows only small variations in its isotopic composition and pure Kr evaluations are challenging. Nevertheless, for most of the MMs sufficient Kr-amounts were detected and particularly in association with the results for Ar and Xe interpretations are conceivable. It seems that especially isotopic fractionation processes are explainable by using combined elemental and isotopic plots of Ar, Kr and Xe. Here, isotopic fractionation processes are clearly present and often occur due to Earth atmosphere transitions of MMs, extraterrestrial radiation as well as terrestrial weathering. An example is 36 Ar/ 132 Xe versus 84 Kr/ 132 Xe, which shows for most of the ScMMs and CS a clear indication of <b>fractionated</b> <b>air.</b> The unmelted UnMMs, however, show noble gas compositions similar to Q (P 1). A few MMs indicate a solar influence not only in He and Ne, but also in Ar - especially in the case of TAM UnMM X 1 as well as a number of DC MMs. The main focus of the measurements was on xenon. On the one hand, the MS "Noblesse" gave us the opportunity to measure Xe in small quantities along with high sensitivities. On the other hand, so far, Xe has not been adequately measured within MMs. The results in this work represent a significant improvement compared to previous measurements of Osawa and Nagao (2002). Of the overall 29 TAM MMs we were able to analyze Xe for 24 particles, however, partially and in particular for the light Xe isotopes with large uncertainties. Here, UnMM 45 c. 35 (3) shows the highest concentration of 132 Xe with 1. 1 x 10 - 8 cc STP/g. The highest concentration for DC and CP MMs was found in DC 06 _ 09 _ 189, with 1. 7 x 10 - 7 cc STP/g. Overall, however, the Xe concentration was for both, the TAM MMs as well as the DC and CP MMs, at a similar level. Two distinct groupings are present. One group shows Xe with an isotopic composition similar to that of the Q(P 1) component. This is usually true for the UnMMs. The other group shows Xe ratios similar to isotopically <b>fractionated</b> <b>air</b> Xe. A single MM sample is particularly and distinctly different of all others - 45 c. 29. The two measured particles of this MM show within all noble gas ratios increased, however, variable spallogenic contributions. Also, this MM contains 244 Pu fission Xe. The probable origin (parent body) of this MM has so far not been revealed by both the noble gas and by petrological and mineralogical studies and requires further research. Using the detected spallogenic 21 Ne concentrations for the two MMs of 45 c. 29 and for 45 b. 17, we were able to calculate rather large CRE-ages of 9 - 71 Ma. Cosmogenic 38 Ar, on the other hand, revealed a range of 5 - 186 Ma. However, the majority of TAM MMs show CRE-ages of less than 1 Ma. The cosmogenic contents in MMs of DC and CP were negligible due to the high levels of solar neon and solar / primordial Ar. In addition, one must consider that the specimens may have lost a large proportion of their original trapped inventory during passage through the Earth's atmosphere, especially concerning the lighter noble gases He and Ne. On Earth, micrometeorites are explored in large numbers, located in a variety of mineralogical compositions as well as sizes and in different climatic regions - certainly the best region would be those of ice and snow. Many MMs show alteration and weathering effects along with signs for interaction with the Earth's atmosphere. However, there exist some specimens, which are virtually unchanged and show the complete spectrum of extraterrestrial components. The results obtained in this work show that the investigation of these particles may contribute to the understanding of the origin of Earth's atmosphere - and thus also of other planetary atmospheres. Furthermore micrometeorites may also help to understand how tiny particles behave and evolve in the solar system. ...|$|R
