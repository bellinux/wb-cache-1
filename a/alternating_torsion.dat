The paper reports on investigations of adhesively bonded shrunk shaft-hub Joints under torsion and combined static or <b>alternating</b> <b>torsion</b> and rotating bending. Tests with torsion and combined static torsion and rotating bending mainly show {{failure of the}} adhesive layer, while <b>alternating</b> <b>torsion</b> and rotating bending predominantly causes fretting fatigue failures. The high-cycle fatigue strength is significantly decreased. Based on experimental results a normalized 3 -D-fatigue diagram is developed. Parameters for normalization are the torsional strength and the endurance limits of <b>alternating</b> <b>torsion</b> and rotating bending. These parameters represent the various influences {{on the strength of}} the joint. The normalized fatigue diagram is the base of a design method called "Bezugsspannungsmethode"...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe cyclic {{behavior}} of 316 L steels is predicted based on crystalline elastoplastic constitutive laws. Calculations are per-formed with the finite element software CAST 3 M, using a polycrystalline mesh where the individual grains are modeled as cubes, having random crystallographic orientations. At the grain scale, the constitutive law parameters are adjusted using single crystal cyclic stress strain curves (CSSCs) from literature. Calculations are performed for different loadingconditions (uniaxial tension-compression, biaxial tension-compression and <b>alternated</b> <b>torsion)</b> {{and a large}} range of three remote plastic strain amplitudes. We obtained 3 close macroscopic CSSCs. Somewhat lower stresses are obtained in torsion, particularly at high plastic strain amplitude. Our results are in agreement with all the published experimental data. The mean plastic strain is computed in each grain, yielding a particular polycrystalline mean grain plastic strain distribution for each loading condition and remote plastic strain. The plastic strain scatter increases for decreasing ma-croscopic strains. The number of cycles to the first micro-crack initiation corresponding to the aforesaid plastic strain distributions is then calculated using a surface roughness based initiation criterion. The effect of the different loading conditions is finally discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{paper is}} mainly {{devoted to a}} {{comparative}} analysis of two plasticity models with a nonlinear hardening law, namely the Armstrong and Frederick model, and a recent modification proposed in literature {{in the framework of}} Generalized Standard Materials (GSM). We first provide a detailed mathematical analysis of the two models by appropriately resorting to the bipotential theory. This delivers for the GSM model a closed form expression of a bipotential. Moreover, it is demonstrated {{for the first time that}} the Armstrong and Frederick model does not admit a convex potential; this result confirms the necessary requirement of a non associated framework for this model. Then, for the modified model, making use of the above bipotential-based tools, we carry out a shakedown analysis of a thin walled tube under constant tension and <b>alternating</b> cyclic <b>torsion.</b> The accuracy of the obtained results is checked by comparing them to data obtained by numerical solving the corresponding shakedown bounds problems. Finally, the predictions of the two models are compared and illustrated their significant differences...|$|R

40|$|Combining {{shrunk fit}} with {{adhesive}} bond in shaft hub joints significantly increases strength and fatigue strength. After investigations of adhesively bonded shrunk shaft hub joints under torsion and combined statical torsion and rotating bending {{during the last}} years, now the resistance under altering torsion and rotating bending is examined. Different from former tests which generally showed failure of the adhesive layer, present tests dominantly result fretting fatigue failures. The high cycle strength is significantly decreased and failure of the shaft mainly occurs. Based on experimental results a normalized 3 -D-fatigue diagram is developed. Parameters of normalizing are the torsional strength and the endurance limits of <b>alternating</b> <b>torsion</b> and rotating bending.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{generate}} a mathematical model of the octopus movements, the arm was approximated as a robot with {{a high number of}} links. The continuous arm is approximated by a kinematic chain with a high number of revolute joints, describing the local curvature and <b>torsion,</b> <b>alternated</b> with prismatic joints describing the local elongation. The forward kinematics of such system can thus be described by a set of three Euler angles and a scalar offset. The ZYX decomposition of the Euler angles resulted in the most appropriate selection for the motion range in our dataset. This representation is reversible; i.e., by having the angles and offset, the points in Cartesian space can be retrieved and vice-versa.|$|R
40|$|The use of PM {{materials}} is rapidly expanding concentrating {{more and more}} on highly loaded structural parts such as synchronizer hubs, gears, sprockets or shifting forks. Several papers, presented during the last years on PM-conferences have confirmed the highly stressed volume concept as an excellent method to assess the local durability in sharp notched areas considering the local properties of the material and stress gradients. Based on the method of highly stressed volume (HSV) this paper presents an approach to estimate the local durability by simply determinable static material properties including sinter-hardened condition. For this purpose, results of fatigue strength tests under axial, bending and <b>torsion</b> <b>alternating</b> loading (R = - 1) with up to six different specimen geometries, three different sinter alloys and two different densities will be analysed in order to estimate the endurable fatigue strength in correlation with the highly stressed volume...|$|R

In this project, the <b>alternating</b> <b>torsion</b> {{fatigue test}} {{was carried out}} to {{investigate}} {{the effect of the}} nitrided case produced by gas and plasma nitriding processes on the fatigue endurance of the JIS SACM 645 steel. The surface layers of the nitrided specimens exhibited hardness profiles in the range between 1000 – 1100 HV 0. 1, and the white layer of the nitrided specimen was consisted of Fe 3 N and Fe 4 N. Wear test result indicated that the mass loss of JIS SACM 645 steel was greatly improved by nitriding processes. From the mass loss data, the wear resistance of the steel was significantly influenced by nitriding time.

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} investigation of the multiaxial fatigue behaviour of the R 7 T steel are presented. The R 7 T steel is currently employed {{in the production of}} solid high-speed railway wheels. Wheel failures due to rolling contact fatigue may occur and, on some occasions, fatigue cracks nucleate in the sub-surface region under the contact area between wheel and rail. Here, the stress field is multiaxial and the loading path is non-proportional. Specimens extracted from the rim of railway wheels were subjected to combined out-of-phase <b>alternating</b> <b>torsion</b> and pulsating compressive axial loads, a non-proportional stress state which is similar to that observed under the contact area in the wheel rim. The tests results are discussed in the light of some multiaxial fatigue theories, chosen among those based on the critical plane concept and those implementing an integral approach, with the aim of selecting a fatigue criterion suitable for the sub-surface fatigue assessment of railway wheels...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} develop a two-way rotary shape memory alloy thin strip actuator, the {{torsional}} deformation and fatigue properties of a TiNi SMA thin strip were investigated. The results obtained are summarized as follows. (1) In the SMA thin strip subjected to torsion, the MT appears {{along the edge of}} the strip due to elongation of the edge of the strip and grows to the central part. (2) The number of cycles to failure decreases with an increase in the maximum angle of twist in torsion fatigue. The fatigue life in pulsating torsion is longer than that in <b>alternating</b> <b>torsion</b> by five times. The fatigue limit exists in a certain value of dissipated work of the strip in each cycle. (3) Based on the two-way motion of a lifting actuator model driven by two kinds of SMA thin strip, it is confirmed that the two-way rotary actuator with a small and simple mechanism can be developed by using the SMA thin strips.

There is a well known relation between the existence of metrics of positive scalar curvature on a closed manifold M and the topology of M. If there exist metrics with positive scalar curvature κ, one would like to measure how large κ can become. This could be done using the Yamabe number or σ-invariant σ(M), which is defined by taking the infimum of the integral of κ for all metrics in a conformal class, and then the supremum over all conformal classes. As announced by Ammann, Dahl and Humbert in [Am], there exists a constant cm> 0 for m = dim M such that min(σ(M),cm) is a spin bordism invariant over Bπ 1 (M). In this note however, we will consider the pointwise scalar curvature instead...|$|E

40|$|The most {{important}} failure cause in automotive industry {{is believed to}} be fatigue. Hence, predicting the lifetime of critical components would be of interest for manufacturers. Computerized methods for predicting the fatigue lifetime as well as microstructural predictions could always be helpful once utilized properly. Amongst numerous components used in automotive industry, limited numbers are subjected to torsion especially if they are welded, but their reduced quality could lead into catastrophic failure. As a matter of fact, the fatigue properties of structures subjected to torsion loading is less investigated than the properties under other loading conditions. Combining the ideas above, this work has been developed based on modeling, simulating and predicting plenty of characteristics in high strength steel welds subjected to <b>alternating</b> <b>torsion</b> loading, using a number of softwares. Numerous approaches for predicting fatigue lifetime in such components alongside of microstructural prediction and control in those welds were engaged to help the automotive industry grasp a deeper knowledge about such specific cases. A test specimen which can include both welded high strength steels and specifications for bearing torsion loading has been designed. For analyzing the stress distribution on such specimen under defined torsion loading, ABAQUS was used. Then the model was imported into FRANC 3 D which specifically looks into fatigue via Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) method. Afterwards, several other methods and hypotheses were employed to do the same procedure for comparison. For instance; strain-base hypotheses, Elasto-Plastic Fracture Mechanics (EPFM), rain-flow analysis for spectrum loading cases and hot-spot analysis were employed. The other interesting part of prediction relates to weld’s microstructure. For predicting the microstructure, both cooling rates after welding and CCT diagrams should be available. JMatPro® was predicting CCT curves for those joined steels and a Matlab code was predicting cooling rates visually, using Rosenthal equations. Coupling Matlab and JMatPro® resulted in compatible results compared to what was gained experimentally. At the end, the conditions and influence of residual stresses have been studied...|$|E
