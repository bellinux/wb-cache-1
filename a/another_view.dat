5|$|Ardhanarishvara {{represents}} {{the synthesis of}} masculine and feminine energies of the universe (Purusha and Prakriti) and illustrates how Shakti, the female principle of God, is inseparable from (or the same as, according to some interpretations) Shiva, the male principle of God. The union of these principles is exalted as the root and womb of all creation. <b>Another</b> <b>view</b> is that Ardhanarishvara {{is a symbol of}} Shiva's all-pervasive nature.|$|E
5|$|The {{short-term}} use of benzodiazepines adversely affects multiple {{areas of}} cognition, {{the most notable}} one being that it interferes with the formation and consolidation of memories of new material and may induce complete anterograde amnesia. However, researchers hold contrary opinions regarding the effects of long-term administration. One view {{is that many of}} the short-term effects continue into the long-term and may even worsen, and are not resolved after stopping benzodiazepine usage. <b>Another</b> <b>view</b> maintains that cognitive deficits in chronic benzodiazepine users occur only for a short period after the dose, or that the anxiety disorder is the cause of these deficits.|$|E

50|$|Pomerelia {{has also}} been settled by Slavs in the 7th and 8th century.

5|$|Accounts differ as to {{the cause}} of death; one version stated that he died by poison only and <b>another</b> <b>view</b> claimed he died by a self-inflicted gunshot while biting down on a cyanide capsule. Contemporary historians have {{rejected}} these accounts as being either Soviet propaganda or an attempted compromise in order to reconcile the different conclusions. One eyewitness stated that Hitler's corpse showed signs of having been shot through the mouth, but this has been proven unlikely. There is also controversy regarding the authenticity of skull and jaw fragments that were recovered. In 2009, American researchers performed DNA tests on a skull that Soviet officials had long believed to be that of Hitler. The tests and examination revealed that the skull was actually that of a woman less than 40 years old. The recovered jaw fragments were not tested.|$|E
5|$|Oral history {{offers several}} stories {{regarding}} {{the origins of}} the Sihanaka. Betsimisaraka traders may have been the first to reach the area traveling inland on the Maningory River. <b>Another</b> <b>view</b> posits that the presence of ancient earthen defensive trenches suggests the ancestors of the Merina may have passed by Lake Alaotra on their migration from the southeastern coast to the central highlands, leaving behind settlers whose descendants formed the first Sihanaka communities. Alternatively, a large group calling itself Sihanaka may have migrated from Imerina into the Alaotra area, which may have already been settled by individuals of various other ethnic groups, in order to maintain independence from the rule of the Merina king.|$|E
5|$|The highway then ascends Ghost Rock Summit, {{the highest}} point for I-70 inside the swell. At the summit is <b>another</b> <b>view</b> area {{overlooking}} the Little Grand Canyon of the San Rafael River. The summit is named for unusual rock formations nearby. The Ghost Rocks themselves are at , although the freeway is slightly lower. I-70 meanders through a relatively flat portion of the swell until reaching Spotted Wolf Canyon, which provides the exit route to the swell. The eastern descent features one brake check area and two runaway truck ramps to aid trucks down. About halfway down is a view area of the canyon narrowing as it approaches the eastern escarpment of the swell, the San Rafael Reef. Just as the highway exits the swell it passes {{to the north of}} Goblin Valley State Park. The highway exits the swell near Green River.|$|E

5|$|On 1 January 1519, Zwingli {{gave his}} first sermon in Zurich. Deviating from the {{prevalent}} practice of basing a {{sermon on the}} Gospel lesson of a particular Sunday, Zwingli, using Erasmus' New Testament as a guide, began to read through the Gospel of Matthew, giving his interpretation during the sermon, known as the method of lectio continua. He continued to read and interpret the book on subsequent Sundays {{until he reached the}} end and then proceeded in the same manner with the Acts of the Apostles, the New Testament epistles, and finally the Old Testament. His motives for doing this are not clear, but in his sermons he used exhortation to achieve moral and ecclesiastical improvement which were goals comparable with Erasmian reform. Sometime after 1520, Zwingli's theological model began to evolve into an idiosyncratic form that was neither Erasmian nor Lutheran. Scholars do not agree on the process of how he developed his own unique model. One view is that Zwingli was trained as an Erasmian humanist and Luther played a decisive role in changing his theology. <b>Another</b> <b>view</b> is that Zwingli did not pay much attention to Luther's theology and in fact he considered it as part of the humanist reform movement. A third view is that Zwingli was not a complete follower of Erasmus, but had diverged from him as early as 1516 and that he independently developed his theology.|$|E
