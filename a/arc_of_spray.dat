40|$|The use <b>of</b> thermal <b>spray</b> {{stainless}} steel coatings for protection of low alloyed steels against {{different types of}} corrosion is limited due to high porosity levels and oxide inclusions. In this paper electrochemical methods like corrosion potential monitoring and cyclic voltammetry are reported to monitor the corrosion resistance <b>of</b> thermal <b>spray</b> coatings. The studied {{stainless steel}} AISI 316 coatings are deposited by arc spraying, plasma spraying or {{high velocity oxygen fuel}} (HVOF) spraying. The electrochemical tests are performed in a 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4 solution. It is found that none of the tested coatings had an electrochemical response equal to that of stainless steel alloy AISI 316. The results indicate that the HVOF coating has the highest corrosion resistance and the corrosion resistance <b>of</b> <b>arc</b> <b>spray</b> coatings can be improved by spraying in an inert argon atmosphere. The electrochemical response <b>of</b> the studied <b>arc</b> <b>spray</b> coatings is independent of substrate type (including the case of no substrate), indicating that the underlying alloy does not contribute to the corrosion process and only the coating itself is attacked. The HVOF coatings age rapidly in a 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4 solution. It is proposed that this is due to pore opening and pore widening...|$|R
40|$|Topographical morphologies <b>of</b> <b>arc</b> <b>sprayed</b> {{aluminum}} coatings were tailored by post-spray steam sterilization processing at 120 degrees C. The porous needle-like nanostructures {{show the}} oxide grains of 250 nm {{in length and}} 60 nm in width grown {{on the surface of}} the coatings. The in-situ growth of the top alumina layer with the unique nano-patterns on aluminum coatings together with the flattened topography of aluminum formed during the spraying gave rise to a unique micro-/nano- hybrid structure. The structure and the presence of alumina synergistically offer the coatings excellent capability to inhibit effectively the adhesion of marine alga Chlorella and Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Potentiodynamic polarization testing further evidenced significantly enhanced corrosion resistance of the aluminum coatings after the autoclaving treatment. The results would give insights into processing thermal sprayed metallic coatings for desired topological structures for versatile properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Experiments were conducted using a Box-type full-factorial design parametric study. Operating parameters were varied around the typical process parameters (i. e., current, primary and secondary pressure, spray distance) in a systematic design of experiments (SDE) in order to display the range of processing conditions and their effect on the resultant coating. The coatings were characterized by hardness tests and optical metallography. Coating properties were quantified for hardness, porosity, deposition efficiency, and microstructure.

40|$|The {{diameter}} of droplets in electric arc wire spraying {{is critical in}} determining the microstructure, porosity and oxide content <b>of</b> the resulting <b>sprayed</b> coatings. Droplet diameter controls dynamic and thermal behaviour in the spray, and the splashing and spreading behaviour of droplets at deposition. In electric arc wire spraying, the droplet diameter is determined {{by a combination of}} the melting behaviour of the feedstock wires in a direct current arc, combined with primary and secondary atomisation processes under the action of a high velocity atomising gas. The high frequency arc voltage variations during electric <b>arc</b> <b>spraying</b> <b>of</b> Fe- 0 · 8 C have been investigated and arc voltage fluctuations related to atomisation events occurring at the wire tips during spraying. A simple analytical model has been proposed which allows the {{diameter of}} primary droplets produced by atomisation to be calculated from the wire feedrate and the average time period for material removal, which was obtained from the voltage traces. Primary droplets were then assumed to undergo secondary atomisation according to correlations from the literature, and resulting droplet diameters were compared with diameters measured by experiment. Despite uncertainties in some of the thermophysical data and dynamic conditions during atomisation, predicted droplet diameters were in good agreement with experimental mass mean droplet diameters obtained under a range of atomising gas pressures, arc voltages and wire feedrates...|$|R

The process sprays molten tool steel from a set <b>of</b> <b>arc</b> <b>spray</b> guns onto a ceramic former {{to build up a}} thick steel shell. The volumetric contraction that occurs as the steel cools is offset by a volumentric expansion taking place within the sprayed steel, which allows the dimensional accurate tools to be produced.

The temperature profile is measured using a thermal imaging camera and regulated by adjusting {{the rate at which the}} guns spray the steel. Because the temperature is regulated by adjusting the feed rate to an actuator that is moving over the surface, this is an example of mobile control, which is a class of distributed parameter control.

The chambers were thermally cycled at a chamber pressure of 600 psia using oxygen-hydrogen as propellants and liquid hydrogen as the coolant. The thicker coatings tended to delaminate, early in the cyclic testing, down to a uniform sublayer which remained well adhered during the remaining cycles. Two chambers with. 003 inch coatings were subjected to 1500 thermal cycles with no coating loss in the throat region, which represents a tenfold increase in life over identical chambers having no coatings. An analysis is presented which shows that the heat lost to the coolant due to the coating, in a rocket thrust chamber design having a coating only in the throat region, can be recovered by adding only one inch to the combustion chamber length...|$|R
