5|$|Symmetry is {{pervasive}} in living things. Animals mainly have bilateral or mirror symmetry, <b>as</b> <b>do</b> {{the leaves of}} plants and some flowers such as orchids. Plants often have radial or rotational symmetry, <b>as</b> <b>do</b> many flowers and some groups of animals such as sea anemones. Fivefold symmetry {{is found in the}} echinoderms, the group that includes starfish, sea urchins, and sea lilies.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} species of shrimp and fish take refuge among the {{branches}} of Millepora alcicornis, seemingly immune to the venom. Hawkfish in particular often perch {{on top of the}} fire coral, perhaps protected by their skinless pectoral fins. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Millepora alcicornis has few predators. The fireworm (Hermodice carunculata) sometimes grazes on it, but prefers other corals. Certain nudibranchs in the genus Phyllidia eat it <b>as</b> <b>do</b> filefish in the family Monacanthidae.|$|E
5|$|A {{week before}} her death, Mary {{went through her}} papers, weeding out some which were burnt, but her journal survives, <b>as</b> <b>do</b> her letters to William and to Frances Apsley. The Jacobites lambasted her, but the {{assessment}} of her character that came down to posterity was largely the vision of Mary as a dutiful, submissive wife, who assumed power reluctantly, exercised it with considerable ability when necessary, and willingly deferred it to her husband.|$|E

5|$|All lemuriforms have a VNO, <b>as</b> <b>do</b> tarsiers {{and some}} New World monkeys. Adapiforms exhibit {{the gap between}} the upper incisors, which {{indicates}} the presence of a VNO, but there is some disagreement over whether or not they possessed a rhinarium.|$|E

5|$|As {{the month}} of August begins, special stalls, fun fairs and shops are set up across {{the country for the}} sale of {{national}} flags, buntings, banners and posters, badges, pictures of national heroes, multimedia and other celebratory items. Vehicles, private buildings, homes, and streets are decorated with national flags, candles, oil lamps, pennants and buntings.

50|$|A similar tie-breaking rule {{is round}} half to odd. By this convention, if the {{fraction}} of y is 0.5, then q is the odd integer nearest to y. Thus, for example, +23.5 becomes +23, <b>as</b> <b>does</b> +22.5; while −23.5 becomes −23, <b>as</b> <b>does</b> −22.5.|$|R

Cottontail rabbits and wood rabbits live throughout the Hills, <b>as</b> <b>do</b> squirrels, raccoons, chipmunks, and porcupines. Wild burro and bobcat can be found, as well as bison in limited quantity. Woodpecker, robin, sparrow, jay, bobwhite, and wren are Black Hills birds.|$|E

5|$|Chrysippus {{regarded}} bodies, surfaces, lines, places, {{the void}} and time as all being infinitely divisible.

50|$|The {{governing}} centre-left Democratic Party ran {{a united}} slate, <b>as</b> <b>did</b> Berlusconi's right-wing opposition list.

5|$|Ecclesiastical {{heraldry}} {{refers to}} the use of heraldry within the Christian Church for dioceses and Christian clergy. Initially used to mark documents, ecclesiastical heraldry evolved as a system for identifying people and dioceses. It is most formalized within the Catholic Church, where most bishops, including the Pope, have a personal coat of arms. Clergy in Anglican, Lutheran, Eastern Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches follow similar customs, <b>as</b> <b>do</b> institutions such as schools and dioceses.|$|E

One of New Zealand's only two native species of non-marine mammal, the long-tailed bat, lives in small numbers within the forests, and several species of lizard are also found locally, including the southern forest gecko.|$|E

5|$|Integrated {{circuits}} {{and printed}} circuit boards increasingly feature copper in place of aluminium because of its superior electrical conductivity; heat sinks and heat exchangers use copper because of its superior heat dissipation properties.

5|$|Killer whales {{have good}} {{eyesight}} {{above and below}} the water, excellent hearing, and a good sense of touch.
