5|$|In 1929, Down Street {{was one of}} the {{stations}} suggested for closure in connection with the extension of the Piccadilly line: the elimination of less-busy stations in the central area would improve both reliability and journey times for long-distance commuters. Additionally, the neighbouring stations were being rebuilt with escalators in place of lifts <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> entrances were even nearer to Down Street, further squeezing its catchment area. The station was permanently closed on 21 May 1932.|$|E

5|$|In mid-2014, {{having just}} {{finished}} their previous collaboration, Fatale, Brubaker and artist Sean Phillips were deliberating whether their next project {{would be a}} noir period piece or a science fiction tale. Brubaker did not think a noir set in 1940s Hollywood was commercial enough to be accepted through normal channels, but the timing aligned with their five-year exclusive contract with Image Comics. This contract guaranteed that the creators could publish any comic without having to pitch it to the publisher first. The pair announced The Fade Out <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> contract on January 9, 2014, at Image Expo. At the time, no length was given for the series {{because they were not}} sure how many issues were needed to tell the story. Since Fatale had taken twice as long as originally planned, {{they did not want to}} mislead fans or feel pressure to conclude before they were ready. They did know it would be a minimum of 12 issues.|$|E

5|$|With the Confederacy defeated, South Carolina {{ratified}} a {{new constitution}} in 1865 that recognized the end of slavery, but basically left the pre-war elites in charge. African-American freedmen, who were the majority of South Carolina's population, were given no vote, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> freedom was soon restricted by Black Codes that limited their civil rights and required black farm laborers to bind themselves with annual labor contracts. Congress was dissatisfied with this minimal change and required {{a new constitution}}al convention and elections with universal male suffrage. As African Americans generally favored the Republican Party at the time, that party controlled the biracial state legislature beginning with the 1868 elections. That campaign was marked by violence—19 Republican and Union League activists were killed in South Carolina's 3rd congressional district alone.|$|E
5|$|While the production's lawyers {{worked to}} clarify its legal {{standing}} in the Summer of 2005, it emerged that Humbert Balsan's deeply indebted production company Ognon Pictures had pledged all rights to the production to Coficiné in exchange for loans. With production in legal stasis and faced with a lengthy court battle to recover the rights, the producers agreed to a settlement with Ognon's bankruptcy officer. In the meantime, the French partners Mezzanine Film declared their uncomfortableness with {{the scale of the}} production, and after mutual agreement with the producers, left the project on September 5, 2005. After meeting with the producers <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> French partner, Paul Saadoun of 13 Production, Coficiné consented to completing the film. On February 6, 2006, Tarr and producer Gábor Téni issued a press release which documented at length the developments with the troubled production to that date, and expressed their hope and intent to persevere in completing the film. Tarr duly restarted shooting in March 2006, after a year of inactivity. The filmmakers dedicated The Man from London to their late colleague Humbert Balsan.|$|E
