25|$|A {{report by}} a High Level Panel on Humanitarian Cash Transfers {{found that only}} 6% of aid is {{delivered}} {{in the form of}} cash or vouchers.

25|$|Several {{million people}} in North Korea have died of {{starvation}} since the mid-1990s, with <b>aid</b> <b>groups</b> and human rights NGOs often stating that the North Korean government has systematically and deliberately prevented food aid from reaching the areas most devastated by food shortages.

25|$|A {{letter from}} a worker with the Islamic Relief {{organization}} provided a detailed account from the ground. Schools became refugee collection centers and prices hiked due to the closures of shops and businesses. Mortars, gunmen, and a government imposed curfew hindered efforts for refugees and aid workers to travel freely. Since the only hospital was located in the bombarded Old City, <b>aid</b> <b>groups</b> within Saada became the only means for the populace to gain limited amounts of food, water, and shelter.|$|E
25|$|On 1 May 2010, the West African {{nation of}} Chad {{was on the}} verge of a {{nationwide}} famine as drought, armed conflict, and an influx of Darfur refugees all contributed to a chronic food shortage that now affects 2,000,000 people (20% of the country's total population). Various <b>aid</b> <b>groups,</b> NGOs and charities said a catastrophic famine could hit the country in the near future if food relief does not arrive soon. The UN warned that a famine had hit the town of Mao in Chad's Kanem region.|$|E

25|$|By 8 April 2010, {{starving}} children and elders filled the wards {{of a hospital}} in Akobo, Sudan. Several <b>aid</b> <b>groups</b> like Save the Children and Medair found out that 46% {{of children in the}} region were malnourished. The U.N. blamed two years of failed rainfall and the ongoing tribal clashes in the region for helping to create the humanitarian crisis in southern Sudan. The World Food Programme(WFP) was feeding 80,000 (up from 20,000 since April 2009) and the U.N. says 4,300,000 people in southern Sudan need food aid.|$|E
25|$|In March 2009 Sudan President Omar al-Bashir {{ordered that}} all <b>aid</b> <b>groups</b> cease {{operations}} in Sudan within one year. Sudan had previously expelled 13 aid agencies, including Oxfam, Save the Children, and two branches of Médecins Sans Frontières. Some groups {{were required to}} leave the country within 24 hours and no guarantees of staff safety could be made. The International Criminal Court had issued a warrant for President Bashir's arrest and he accused the aid workers of spying on the Court's behalf. His statement was later clarified to say that the order did not apply to UN agencies.|$|E
25|$|Almost 200 United Nations {{aid workers}} left two {{humanitarian}} bases in Guereda in eastern Chad on 2006-01-22, {{after a meeting}} between UN officials and local government officials who were being briefed {{on the status of}} the 200,000 Sudanese refugees in Chad was forcibly ended by up to 100 armed men of unknown, but most likely Janjaweed, affiliation. Five Chadian government officials including the top government official of Guereda {{and the head of the}} local branch of the military police were kidnapped, jeeps belonging to two <b>aid</b> <b>groups</b> were stolen, and five local residents suffered gunshot wounds.

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} active individual muscle stretching (AID) on muscle function. [Subjects] We used the right legs of 40 healthy male students. [Methods] Subjects were divided into an <b>AID</b> <b>group,</b> which performed stretching, and a control group, which did not. We examined and compared muscle function before and after stretching in the <b>AID</b> and control <b>groups</b> using a goniometer and Cybex equipment. [Results] A significant increase in flexibility and {{a significant decrease in}} muscle strength output were observed in the <b>AID</b> <b>group</b> after the intervention. [Conclusion] These results suggest that AID induces an increase in flexibility and a temporary decrease in muscle output strength...|$|R

25|$|At {{the time}} of the genocide, {{competition}} between the medical efforts of MSF, the ICRC, and other <b>aid</b> <b>groups</b> had reached an all-time high, but the conditions in Rwanda prompted a drastic change in the way humanitarian organisations approached aid missions. The Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief Programmes was created by the ICRC in 1994 to provide a framework for humanitarian missions and MSF is a signatory of this code. The code advocates the provision of humanitarian aid only, and groups are urged not to serve any political or religious interest, or be used as a tool for foreign governments. MSF has since still found it necessary to condemn the actions of governments, such as in Chechnya in 1999, but has not demanded another military intervention since then.|$|E
25|$|A {{consequence}} of the conflict in Niger {{was a series of}} arrests of domestic journalists, and expulsions or closings of foreign press and <b>aid</b> <b>groups.</b> The state of emergency in the Agadez Region, re-authorised every six months since November 2007, has barred foreign press or aid from the area. In mid-2008, the French charity Doctors without borders (MSF) was forced to close a childhood malnutrition treatment program in Maradi Region which had been operating since 2005. MSF was subsequently ejected from the country by the Nigerien government. The rebroadcasting of foreign radio broadcasts in Niger has been interupped several times since mid-2007 by government order. Nigerien journalists say they are often pressured by local authorities. The north, under a state of emergency, has become off-limits to both domestic and foreign press, and the independent Radio Agadez in the north has been closed by the government.|$|E
25|$|Between 1975 and 1979, after South Vietnam {{had fallen}} to North Vietnam, {{millions}} of Cambodians emigrated to Thailand to avoid the Khmer Rouge. In response MSF set up its first refugee camp missions in Thailand. When Vietnam withdrew from Cambodia in 1989, MSF started long-term relief missions to help survivors of the mass killings and reconstruct the country’s health care system. Although its missions to Thailand to help victims of war in Southeast Asia could arguably be seen as its first war-time mission, MSF saw its first mission to a true war zone, including exposure to hostile fire, in 1976. MSF spent nine years (1976–1984) assisting surgeries in the hospitals of various cities in Lebanon, during the Lebanese Civil War, and established a reputation for its neutrality and willingness to work under fire. Throughout the war, MSF helped both Christian and Muslim soldiers alike, helping whichever group required the most medical aid at the time. In 1984, as the situation in Lebanon deteriorated further and security for <b>aid</b> <b>groups</b> was minimised, MSF withdrew its volunteers.|$|E
