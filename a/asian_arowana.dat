25|$|Unlike most fish, the <b>Asian</b> <b>arowana</b> reaches sexual {{maturity}} relatively late, after 3â€“4 yr. The females produce few eggs, 30-100, which are quite large. After {{the eggs are}} fertilized, the <b>Asian</b> <b>arowana</b> exhibits great parental care with paternal mouthbrooding. Both the fertilized eggs and larvae are brooded within the male's mouth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Asian</b> <b>arowana</b> {{scales are}} large, cycloid, and, in some varieties, metallic-coloured, with a {{distinctive}} mosaic pattern of raised ribs. The lateral scales {{are arranged in}} horizontal rows numbered from the most ventral (first level) to the most dorsal (fifth level), with dorsal scales designated the sixth level.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Asian</b> <b>arowanas</b> {{grow up to}} [...] total length. Like all Scleropages, <b>Asian</b> <b>arowanas</b> {{have long}} bodies; large, {{elongated}} pectoral fins, dorsal and anal fins located far back on the body; and a much larger caudal fin than that of their South American relative, the silver arowana, Osteoglossum bicirrhosum. The mouth is oblique with a very wide gape. The prominent lower jaw has two barbels at its tip. The gill rakers are stout. <b>Asian</b> <b>arowanas</b> bear teeth on many bones of the mouth, including the jaws, vomer, palatines, pterygoids, parasphenoid, and tongue.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to their}} {{resemblance}} to the <b>Asian</b> <b>Arowanas</b> they are sometimes sold {{in the name of}} golden Arowana in some of the Asian countries, like India. However, they can be easily distinguished from the <b>Asian</b> <b>Arowanas</b> by identifying their red spotted fins & 7-8 rows of scales on their body.|$|R
2500|$|The Osteoglossidae are {{the only}} {{exclusively}} freshwater fish family found {{on both sides of}} the Wallace Line. This may be explained by the theory that <b>Asian</b> <b>arowanas</b> [...] (S. formosus) diverged from the Australian Scleropages, S. jardinii and S. leichardti, about 140 Mya, making it likely that <b>Asian</b> <b>arowanas</b> were carried to Asia on the Indian subcontinent.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>arowana</b> (Scleropages formosus) {{comprises}} several phenotypic {{varieties of}} freshwater fish distributed geographically across Southeast Asia. [...] While most consider the different varieties {{to belong to a}} single species, work by Pouyaud et al. (2003) differentiates these varieties into multiple species. They have several other common names, including Asian bonytongue, dragonfish, and a number of names specific to the different color varieties.|$|E

25|$|Like {{all members}} of the Osteoglossidae, <b>Asian</b> <b>arowanas</b> are highly adapted to fresh water and are {{incapable}} of surviving in the ocean. Therefore, their spread throughout the islands of southeast Asia suggests they diverged from other osteoglossids before the continental breakup was complete. Genetic studies have confirmed this hypothesis, showing the ancestor of the <b>Asian</b> <b>arowanas</b> diverged from the ancestor of the Australian arowanas, S. jardinii and S. leichardti, about 140million years ago, during the Early Cretaceous period. This divergence took place in the eastern margin of Gondwanaland, with the ancestors of <b>Asian</b> <b>arowanas</b> carried on the Indian subcontinent or smaller landmasses into Asia. The morphological similarity of all Scleropages species shows little evolutionary change has taken place recently for these ancient fish.|$|R
25|$|Beginning in 1989, CITES began {{allowing}} <b>Asian</b> <b>arowanas</b> to be traded, provided certain {{criteria were}} met, most notably {{that they were}} bred in captivity on a fish farm {{for at least two}} generations. The first of these farms was in Indonesia. Later, the Singapore government's Agri-food and Veterinary Authority (then called the Primary Production Department) and a local fish exporter collaborated in a captive breeding program. <b>Asian</b> <b>arowanas</b> legally certified by CITES for trade became available from this program in 1994.|$|R
25|$|Native to Southeast Asia, <b>Asian</b> <b>arowanas</b> inhabit blackwater rivers, slow-moving waters {{flowing through}} forested swamps and wetlands. Adults feed on other fish, while juveniles feed on insects.|$|R

25|$|<b>Asian</b> <b>arowanas</b> are {{distinguished}} from Australian congenerics S. jardinii and S. leichardti by having fewer (21-26) lateral line scales (versus 32-36 for the Australian species), longer pectoral and pelvic fins, and a longer anterior snout.|$|R
25|$|Both grey-tailed and yellow-tailed silver <b>Asian</b> <b>arowanas</b> {{are dark}} grey {{on the back}} and silver on the sides, with dark ring patches on the lateral scales and a silvery or whitish belly. In yellow-tailed specimens, the fin {{membranes}} are yellowish with dark-grey rays. In grey-tailed specimens, the fins are uniformly dark grey.|$|R
2500|$|Because {{they can}} {{grow up to}} [...] long, <b>Asian</b> <b>arowanas</b> require large aquaria. They are {{territorial}} and may be kept with other Scleropages only in a very large aquarium, provided all fish are of similar size.

50|$|Like other Arowanas, it is a mouthbrooder, {{but unlike}} the <b>Asian</b> <b>Arowana,</b> reports suggest the female rather than the male broods the young in her mouth.|$|E
50|$|The silver arowana {{is often}} kept as a pet by {{experienced}} aquarists, being considered an accessible {{substitute for the}} <b>Asian</b> <b>arowana,</b> which is listed on CITES Appendix I and is therefore difficult and expensive to obtain legally.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Asian</b> <b>arowanas</b> are {{considered}} to be symbols of good luck and prosperity, especially by those from Asian cultures.

50|$|Expedition: Asia {{opened on}} June 15, 2016. The {{traveling}} exhibit features three male Asian small-clawed otters, three <b>Asian</b> <b>arowana,</b> and many {{different species of}} Asian birds, fish, and reptiles.

5000|$|In Singapore, a breeder of rare Dragon fish (<b>Asian</b> <b>Arowana,</b> {{which are}} [...] "lucky fish" [...] {{and being a}} rare species, are {{required}} to be microchipped), makes sure to use numbers with plenty of eights in their microchip tag numbers, and appears to reserve particular numbers especially rich in eights and sixes (e.g., 702088880006688) for particularly valuable specimens.|$|E
25|$|Declining {{habitat is}} a major threat. For example, <b>Asian</b> <b>arowanas</b> are now {{uncommon}} in the Malay Peninsula, where they were once widely distributed, due to environmental destruction. Inclusion in the IUCN Red List was originally based not on biological reasons but on practical ones: though widely distributed throughout southeast Asia, they have been harvested heavily by aquarium collectors. However, habitat loss is likely a greater threat than aquarium collecting.|$|R
25|$|<b>Asian</b> <b>arowanas</b> are {{carnivorous}} {{and should}} be fed a high-quality diet of meaty food, such as shrimp and crickets. They are surface feeders and prefer to take food in the upper parts of the water column. Aquarists recommend live foods and meaty prepared foods. Examples of appropriate live foods include scorpions, centipedes, mealworms, crickets, shrimps, feeder fish, small frogs, and earthworms. Prepared foods include prawns (shrimp), lean pork, frozen fish food, and pelleted food. Some captive arowanas are fed Koi fry {{in an attempt to}} increase the vibrancy of their natural coloration.|$|R

50|$|Some {{countries}} require microchips in imported {{animals to}} match vaccination records. Microchip tagging {{may also be}} required for CITES-regulated international trade in certain endangered animals: for example, <b>Asian</b> <b>Arowana</b> are tagged to limit import to captive-bred fish. Also, birds not banded who cross international borders as pets or for trade must be microchipped so that each bird is uniquely identifiable.|$|E

They have several other common names, including Asian bonytongue, dragonfish, and a number of names specific to the different color varieties.|$|E
50|$|Some commercially {{important}} {{fish are}} mouthbrooders, most notably among the tilapiines and arowanas. Fry harvesting, getting the brooding fish {{to open its}} mouth and release the fry, is important if the fry are to be reared artificially. In the case of endangered species, such as <b>Asian</b> <b>arowana,</b> harvesting may be supervised by an official to certify that the fish farm is a genuine producer of captive-bred fish.|$|E
25|$|No recent {{evaluation}} of conservation status {{has been done}} by the IUCN. Additionally, considering the current confusion as to number of species, as well as the wide distribution, conservation status should be reconsidered. All strains are probably endangered, but some (notably the super red and red-tailed golden) more critically than others. The <b>Asian</b> <b>arowana's</b> high value as aquarium fish has impacted its conservation. Its popularity has soared since the late 1970s, and hobbyists may pay thousands of U.S. dollars for one of these animals. Certain color varieties are more endangered than others, since the red and gold varieties are both less common, and in higher demand in the aquarium trade.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Asian</b> <b>arowanas</b> {{are listed}} as {{endangered}} by the 2006 IUCN Red List, with the most recent evaluation taking place in 1996. [...] International trade in these fishes is controlled under the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), under which it was placed on Appendix I, the most restrictive category, in 1975. [...] S. formosus {{is one of only}} eight fish species listed on Appendix I. [...] A number of registered CITES breeders are in Asia, and the specimens they produce can be imported into several nations. Other nations restrict or prohibit possession of Asian arowanas; for example, the United States has listed this species under the Endangered Species Act, so it cannot be kept in that country without a permit.|$|R
50|$|A {{major theme}} for this {{landlocked}} aquarium {{is the relationship}} between inland freshwater ecosystems and the ocean. The original design of the aquarium was zoogeographic. It focused on the path to the ocean taken by two rivers, the Colorado River in North America and the Kampar River in Indonesia. The Colorado River Journey included exhibits of endangered fish, including desert pupfish; gamefish such as bass; and northern river otters, among other species. It ended with a large exhibit depicting the Sea of Cortez (Gulf of California), into which the actual Colorado River empties. The Indonesia River Journey included exhibits of animals such as <b>Asian</b> <b>arowanas,</b> rainbowfish, and endangered Sumatran tigers, among other species. It ended with a large exhibit depicting the southern Pacific Ocean. In addition to these two journeys, the aquarium housed a large sea otter exhibit.|$|R
