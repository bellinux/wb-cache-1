5|$|A few early sets {{experimented with}} {{alternate}} art for cards. However, Wizards {{came to believe}} that this impeded easy recognition of a card and that having multiple versions caused confusion when identifying a card <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>glance.</b> Consequently, alternate art is now only used sparingly and mostly for promotional cards. When older cards are reprinted in new sets, however, Wizards of the Coast has guaranteed that they will be printed with new art to make the older cards more collectible.|$|E
5|$|Eye {{color is}} {{considered}} a subset of coloring, and coat color definitions often include standards for the eyes, as many genes which control eye color will also affect the coat color or vice versa. The American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association (AFRMA) lists black, pink, ruby, and odd-eyed (two different-colored eyes) as possible eye colors, depending on the variety of rat shown. Ruby refers to eyes which <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>glance</b> appear black but which are on closer observation a deep, dark red.|$|E
50|$|Seismic {{reflection}} profiles, {{studied by}} USGS scientists, {{show that the}} crater was formed by an object or objects which struck from the southwest <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>glancing</b> angle and formed a long, oval crater. Since impact, sediment filled part of the crater, giving it its present triangular shape.|$|R

5|$|The {{building}} is {{cast in the}} Classical Revival architectural style and contains elements common to that style. Stained glass, columns and a pediment are among the more noticeable features <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>glance.</b> The rear facade of the {{building is}} designed to resemble a temple and also features stained glass windows. A stone porte-cochere covers the rear driveway. Inside the building's third floor courtroom is more stained glass, {{in the form of}} a skylight. During the early 1980s a made for television movie had scenes filmed in the DeKalb County Courthouse's courtroom.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example of}} his {{leadership}} and his coup d'œil, {{the ability to see}} <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>glance</b> what needed to be done, occurred after the Battle of Kolin. The loss at Kolin forced the King to lift the siege at Prague. The King's brother, Augustus William, took command of the army and ordered the retreat from Prague. Seydlitz was attached to the advanced corps of Karl Christoph von Schmettau in a brigade of ten squadrons. As Seydlitz's wing entered Lusatia, near the town of Zittau, the Austrians were present in force, and Seydlitz with his squadrons were trapped in the town. Tricking the Austrians into thinking his troop was a foraging party, his cavalry burst on the Austrian cavalry before they could climb into their saddles. Seydlitz led his cavalry in an escape, in close column, and was quickly out of sight.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the rules}} to decode chord {{notation}} are complex, a short article would {{not be sufficient to}} describe them clearly and exhaustively.

30|$|In this scheme, an {{individual}} cloud of the clumpy torus can (dependent on the cloud’s position {{and distribution of}} other clouds) absorb radiation from the central engine on the inner-facing face. This dust will re-emit radiation at NIR wavelengths in all directions. Some of this radiation will be self-absorbed by that clump, and some will be emitted into free space. A small amount of flux will be emitted and penetrate the dust clump <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>glancing</b> angle, leading to obscuration and dichroic polarisation from {{only a portion of}} the dust clump (see Fig. 5).|$|R
