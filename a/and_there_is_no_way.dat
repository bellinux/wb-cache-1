25|$|Gauss Code {{is limited}} {{in its ability to}} {{identify}} knots by a few problems. The starting point on the knot at which to begin tracing the crossings is arbitrary, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to determine which direction to trace in. Also, Gauss Code is unable to indicate the handedness of each crossing, which is necessary to identify a knot versus its mirror. For example, the Gauss Code for the trefoil knot does not specify if it is the right-handed or left-handed trefoil.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the terms}} 'Muslim world' and 'Islamic world' are disputed, since no country is {{homogeneously}} Muslim, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to determine {{at what point}} a Muslim minority in a country is to be considered 'significant' enough, {{there is no consensus}} on how to define the Muslim world geographically. The only rule of thumb for inclusion which has some support, is that countries need to have a Muslim population of more than 50%. Jones (2005) defines a 'large minority' as being between 30% and 50%; thus, there were nine countries with a 'large Muslim minority' in 2000, namely Bosnia and Herzegovina, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Kazakhstan, Macedonia, Nigeria, and Tanzania.|$|E

25|$|Observations of {{the energy}} levels of atoms and {{molecules}} were inconsistent with the nuclear spin expected from proton–electron hypothesis. Molecular spectroscopy of dinitrogen (14N2) showed that transitions originating from even-numbered rotational levels are more intense than those from odd levels, hence the even levels are more populated. According to quantum mechanics and the Pauli exclusion principle, the spin of the 14N nucleus is therefore an integer multiple of ħ (the reduced Planck constant). Yet both protons and electrons carry an intrinsic spin of ½ħ, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to arrange an odd number (14 protons + 7 electrons = 21) of spins ±½ħ to give a spin that is an integer multiple of ħ.|$|E
25|$|The {{rest of the}} Pyramid is {{interpreted}} by Alford as a network of secret chambers in which religious relics were concealed– hence {{the title of his}} book Pyramid of Secrets. This is the weakest part of his case, as the textual support for the idea is thin <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of knowing what might have been contained in the chambers that we know of today. Once again, Alford’s theory can be proven or negated by future exploration, since it is central to his case that further secret chambers exist. In this regard, his thoughts are guided by the scholar J.P. Lepre, who claimed that anomalous patterns in the Pyramid’s masonry joints might be signs to the existence of hidden passages and chambers.|$|E
500|$|Another {{accusation}} frequently made by websites {{predicting the}} collision {{is that the}} U.S. government built the South Pole Telescope (SPT) to track Nibiru's trajectory, and that the object has been imaged optically.

500|$|The {{station has}} a {{full-length}} mezzanine above the platforms and tracks. All of the mezzanine is still completely open, {{with the exception}} of a tiny closed fenced-off section at the station's eastern end that is accessed from a single closed staircase on the Manhattan-bound platform. [...] However, it is set up in a way that does not allow a free transfer between directions, as the fare control is located in the middle of the mezzanine. The token booth and turnstile banks for either direction are at the center. HEET turnstiles are at either ends near the station's entrances and exits, both of which have two street stairs. The entrance at the west (railroad south) end leads to the northwest corner and southwest corners of Queens Boulevard and 75th Avenue, while the one on the east (railroad north) end leads to southeast corner of Queens Boulevard and 75th Road. Chain-link fences separate the sections of the mezzanine within fare control and the section out of fare control. The section of the mezzanine within fare control used to span across the entire space, but a fare-free underpass under Queens Boulevard now divides the northbound and southbound parts of the mezzanine, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to make a free transfer between the two platforms anymore.|$|E

2500|$|Dick {{attended}} Berkeley High School in Berkeley, California. He {{and fellow}} science fiction author Ursula K. Le Guin {{were members of}} the same graduating class (1947) but did not know each other at the time. After graduation, he briefly attended the University of California, Berkeley, (September 1949 to November 11, 1949) with an honorable dismissal granted January 1, 1950. Dick did not declare a major and took classes in history, psychology, philosophy, and zoology. Through his studies in philosophy, he believed that existence is based on internal human perception, which does not necessarily correspond to external reality; he described himself as [...] "an acosmic panentheist," [...] believing in the universe only as an extension of God. [...] After reading the works of Plato and pondering the possibilities of metaphysical realms, Dick came to the conclusion that, in a certain sense, the world is not entirely real <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to confirm whether it is truly there. This question from his early studies persisted as a theme in many of his novels. Dick dropped out because of ongoing anxiety problems, according to his third wife Anne's memoir. She also says he disliked the mandatory ROTC training. At Berkeley, Dick befriended poet Robert Duncan and poet and linguist Jack Spicer, who gave Dick ideas for a Martian language. Dick claimed to have hosted a classical music program on KSMO Radio in 1947. From 1948 to 1952, Dick worked at Art Music Company, a record store on Telegraph Avenue.|$|E
