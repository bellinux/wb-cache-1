5|$|In 1992–93, {{the inaugural}} {{season of the}} English Premier League, Norwich City led the league {{for much of the}} season, having been among the {{pre-season}} favourites for relegation, and were eight points clear of the field shortly before Christmas, before faltering in the final weeks to finish third behind the champions, Manchester United, and Aston Villa. They had shown that they were {{a force to be reckoned}} with from the very first day of the Premier League season, achieving an impressive 4–2 away win over an Arsenal side who were among the pre-season title favourites in a race finally won by Manchester United. This was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>surprise</b> not least to the media and pundits who had tipped Norwich for a season of struggle.|$|E

25|$|Hungarian legend Ferenc Puskás was {{appointed}} {{as the head}} coach of the national side in 1993 in order to bring back earlier success. He led the team for only four matches, however, as the former Honvéd and Real Madrid star failed to make an impact. The only remarkable success in the 1990s was the qualification of Hungary to the 1996 Summer Olympics. Antal Dunai's team played its first group match against Nigeria and lost to 1–0 in Orlando. In the second group match, Hungary played Brazil and lost to 3–1. The only Hungarian goal was scored by Csaba Madar. The last group match was played against Japan, a 3–2 loss. The Hungarian goals were scored by Csaba Madar and Tamás Sándor. Although the Olympic qualification of the young team was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>surprise</b> and people thought that Hungary would have a better future in football history, the team never reached any similar success later.|$|E

Bourzutschky wrote, [...] "This was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>surprise</b> for us and is a great tribute to the complexity of chess."
