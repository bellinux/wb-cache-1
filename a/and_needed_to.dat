5|$|According to {{the medieval}} chronicler Geoffrey Gaimar, after the Battle of Stamford Bridge Harold {{entrusted}} the loot gained from Harold Hardrada to Ealdred. Gaimar asserts that King Harold did {{this because he}} had heard of Duke William's landing in England, <b>and</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> rush south to counter it. After the Battle of Hastings, Ealdred joined the group who tried to elevate Edgar the Ætheling, Edward the Exile's son, as king, but eventually he submitted to William the Conqueror at Berkhamsted. John of Worcester says that the group supporting Edgar vacillated {{over what to do}} while William ravaged the countryside, which led to Ealdred and Edgar's submission to William.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{qualified}} for the 1989 FA Charity Shield as winners of the 1988–89 Football League First Division. The team played Liverpool at Anfield in {{the final game of}} the season <b>and</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> win by two clear goals to be crowned champions. Alan Smith scored for Arsenal early in the second half to make it 1–0, and Michael Thomas's goal with seconds left of the match ensured the team won the league title. Liverpool, days before the league encounter with Arsenal, defeated Everton to win the 1989 FA Cup Final which meant they obtained the other Charity Shield place.|$|E

5|$|Louisiana {{attempted}} {{to pass a}} law that would exempt fantasy sports from its anti-online gambling laws, but the bill was defeated as the result of lobbying by both the Louisiana Family Forum (which showed concerns that players could develop an addiction to daily fantasy games), and the Louisiana Video Gaming Association (which felt that DFS would cannibalize the legal video poker industry, <b>and</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be highly regulated).|$|E
5|$|Many early Northern sports {{players were}} working class <b>and</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> miss work to play, with their teams {{compensating}} them for lost wages. By contrast, Southern teams, drawing from {{the traditions of}} public schools and Oxbridge, put great emphasis on amateurism and the Southern-dominated governing bodies forbade payments to players. This tension shaped the sports of association football and cricket, {{and led to the}} schism between the two main forms of rugby. The North is also associated with the animal sports of dog racing with whippets, pigeon racing and ferret legging, although these are now far more popular in stereotype than in reality.|$|E
5|$|Media {{accounts}} {{had reported}} that the plan had been to fast rope to the inner courtyard and to clear the main house from the ground floor up.

As a result, Osama bin Laden was killed several minutes into the operation. Pfarrer's account differs in that he wrote that a SEAL team was inserted onto the roof of the main house, that Osama bin Laden was killed seconds into the operation, and that the main house was cleared from the top down.|$|E

5|$|Mihailović was {{the first}} to receive reports of contact between the Germans and Partisans, and passed them on to his British Special Operations Executive liaison officer, Colonel Bill Bailey. When Bailey's report arrived in London on 22 March, it was not taken seriously. Italian {{military}} intelligence also became aware of the talks. Tito himself mentioned the prisoner exchanges to the Comintern in Moscow, but when they realised more was being discussed and demanded an explanation, Tito was taken aback. He responded that he was not getting any external support, <b>and</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> look after the interests of captured Partisans and refugees.|$|E
5|$|The {{distillery}} remained open {{throughout the}} Great Depression, an event which affected many other distilleries; it wasn't until the Second World War that the distillery was mothballed {{for the first}} time, by Government decree. In the aftermath of World War Two, Britain was heavily indebted <b>and</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> export large quantities of goods to earn foreign revenue (mainly United States dollars). Distilling was an ideal industry with whisky much in demand overseas. Distilling restrictions were rapidly lifted and output from the distillery was at pre-war levels by 1947, despite ongoing barley, fuel, and manpower limitations. Bread rationing was retained until 1948 {{in order to ensure}} supplies of grain for the distilleries.|$|E

The City argued that the houses were legally nonconforming, and rehabilitating them would cost more than just building new houses.|$|E

5|$|A {{major focus}} for Kenyatta {{during the first}} {{three and a half years}} of Kenya's {{independence}} were the divisions within KANU itself. Opposition to Kenyatta's government grew, particularly following the assassination of Pio Pinto in February 1965. Relations between Kenyatta and Odinga were strained, and at the March 1966 party conference, Odinga's post—that of party Vice President, was divided among eight different politicians. In 1966, Odinga stepped down as state Vice President, claiming that Kenya had failed to achieve economic independence <b>and</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> adopt truly socialist policies. Backed by several other senior KANU figures and trade unionists, he formed the Kenya Peoples Union (KPU). The KPU were legally recognised as the official opposition, thus restoring the country's two party system.|$|E
5|$|Although Herodotus {{presents}} the revolt {{as a consequence}} of Aristagoras and Histiaeus's personal motives, it is clear that Ionia must have been ripe for rebellion anyway. The primary grievance was the tyrants installed by the Persians. While Greek states had in the past often been ruled by tyrants, this was a form of government on the decline. Moreover, past tyrants had tended (<b>and</b> <b>needed)</b> <b>to</b> be strong and able leaders, whereas the rulers appointed by the Persians were simply the representatives of the Persians. Backed by Persian military might, these tyrants did not need the support of the population, and could thus rule absolutely. Aristagoras's actions have thus been likened to tossing a flame into a kindling box; they incited rebellion across Ionia, and tyrannies were everywhere abolished, and democracies established in their place.|$|E
5|$|At times, the coffers were full; in April 1764, {{near the}} end of the Paris sojourn and after two {{successful}} concerts, Leopold announced he would shortly be depositing 2,200 florins with his bankers. Two months later, after the initial London successes, Leopold banked a further 1,100 florins. However, in November of that year, after his illness and with uncertain earning prospects, he was worrying about the high costs of living in Londonhe informed Hagenauer that he had spent 1,870 florins in the four-month period since July. The following summer, after little concert activity, Leopold resorted to increasingly desperate measures to raise funds, including the children's daily circus performances at the Swan and Harp Inn at prices described by Jane Glover as humiliating. The insecurity of travelling life led Leopold to believe, later, that Wolfgang was not worldly-wise enough to attempt such journeys alone, <b>and</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be anchored to an assured salary.|$|E
