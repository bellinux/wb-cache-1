25|$|You {{are asking}} me to „voluntarily {{surrender}} the fortress; otherwise you will be corrected in front of God and humanity“. What a beautiful and humane sentence? Do you believe in God? I doubt that you believe in Him and that love humanity, if you would, then you wouldn't lead his unfortunate soldiers right here to a senseless slaughter, and to certain death, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have spared them, their wives and children, and made them to live quietly at home instead of having led them such a distance because of the pernicious whims of your king.|$|E
500|$|When {{people did}} confess to even a minor {{role in the}} rioting, such as {{throwing}} a few stones, they were charged with affray. One resident told the 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting: [...] "You would go to bed <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> just lie there <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> think, {{are they going to}} come and kick my door, what's going to happen to my children?... It was that horrible fear that you lived with day by day, knowing they could come and kick down your door and hold you for hours." [...] The inquiry heard that 9,165 police officers were either deployed on the estate or held in reserve between 10 and 14 October 1985. Thus, argues Rose, the police created, or at least intensified, a climate of fear in which witnesses were afraid to step forward.|$|E

It is also the second of three songs on the album which lyrics point to anguish ("Remember those times I could call / Through the clear day time / <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be there"). The theme of weather is {{referenced}} again ("The softness, the warmth and the weather in suspense"). The song also references the Cambridge quarry pits, and the landscape.|$|E
500|$|Hughes {{said that}} he had Broderick in mind when he wrote the screenplay, saying Broderick was the only actor he could think of who could pull off the role, calling him clever and charming. [...] "Certain guys would have played Ferris <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have thought, 'Where's my wallet?'" [...] Hughes said. [...] "I had to have that look; that charm had to come through. Jimmy Stewart could have played Ferris at 15...I needed Matthew." [...] Other actors who were {{considered}} for the role included Jim Carrey, John Cusack, Tom Cruise and Michael J. Fox.|$|E
500|$|Whannell {{polished}} the script, with {{input from}} Wan, {{in order to}} bring it into the Saw universe, but kept the characters, traps and deaths from The Desperate script. [...] Bousman said, [...] "But you could read the script for The Desperate and watch Saw II, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not be able to draw a comparison". [...] Wan and Whannell also served as executive producers. All the previous film's crew members returned: editor Kevin Greutert, cinematographer Armstrong, and composer Charlie Clouser. [...] This was to be Hoffman's last film. He died unexpectedly on December 4, 2005.|$|E

500|$|Computer-generated imagery {{was used}} in much of [...] "Days Gone Bye", {{particularly}} when Rick encounters a legless walker. [...] "The woman was wearing basically blue stockings and then everything was cleaned out. There is an alarming amount of CGI in the pilot episode and in the whole show, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> never know it," [...] articulated Robert Kirkman. Kirkman felt that Stargate Studios, which was chosen by producers to edit the pilot episode, did a splendid job. He stated: [...] "There's a shot where Rick is riding off on the horse and his hat actually blew off, and they really liked that shot, and so they had Stargate go in and digitally put the hat back on his head." ...|$|E
500|$|Turner interviewed flautist John Payne for the book, who had {{sat in on}} {{sessions}} with Van Morrison and later collaborated with him. Payne comments on their work together on the album Astral Weeks, which also included musicians Connie Kay, Warren Smith, Jay Berliner, and Richard Davis: [...] "Ironically, the image you have {{when you listen to}} the album now is of these guys who are all together, and they realise they are creating a monumental work of art. The fact is that it was just another session for them." [...] Payne states of his observations of Van Morrison's performance style: [...] "When (Van) was on stage, he would look like a space cadet, but then he'd open his mouth <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> realize that he had channeled everything into the sound of his voice. The rest of it was just a shell that was there for the purpose of producing this noise." ...|$|E
500|$|Care {{was taken}} during the {{programming}} process to give the game a [...] "good feel", with Boon simulating elements such as gravity into the video game design. The game's lead designer and artist John Tobias noted that the previous game's reliance on juggling the opponent {{in the air with}} successive hits was an accident, and had been tightened in Mortal Kombat II. Boon said that the reason to not completely remove it in favor of a different system of chaining attacks together was to set the game apart from the competing titles such as Street Fighter and allow for players to devise their own combinations of attacks. At one point, a bonus stage was planned to feature [...] "a bunch of ninjas jumping all over the place <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> swing at them, just like you're {{in the middle of a}} fight in a kung fu movie." [...] All of the music was composed, performed, recorded and mixed by Dan Forden, the MK series' sound designer and composer, using the Williams DCS sound system.|$|E

500|$|The group {{moved to}} Atlanta, Georgia by May 1, where Walden was {{establishing}} Capricorn Records. Mike Callahan and Joseph [...] "Red Dog" [...] Campbell became the band’s early crew members. [...] "Red Dog" [...] was a disabled Vietnam veteran who donated his monthly disability checks to the band's cause. In Macon, the group stayed at friend Twiggs Lyndon's apartment on 309 College Street, which {{became known as}} the communal home of the band and crew, nicknamed the Hippie Crash Pad. [...] "There were five or six occupied apartments in the building with the Hippie Crash Pad <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> expect they would call the police on us because we were constantly raising hell at three or four in the morning, but they all just moved out," [...] said Trucks. [...] Living meagerly, they found a friend in [...] "Mama Louise" [...] Hudson, cook and proprietor of the H Soul Food Restaurant, who ran a tab when they were short of funds, early on made good with proceeds from Duane's recording sessions on the side. The band's image was radical in the just barely integrated Macon: [...] "A lot of the white folk around here did not approve of them long-haired boys, or of them always having a black guy with them," [...] said Hudson. The band performed locally, as well as 80 miles north in Atlanta's Piedmont Park, and practiced at the newly minted Capricorn nearly each day.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} use this technique, it is {{important}} to note you must have some understanding of the system you are modeling. [...] For each gradually varied flow transition, you must know both boundary conditions and you must also calculate length of that transition. [...] (e.g. For an M1 Profile, you must find the rise at the downstream boundary condition, the normal depth at the upstream boundary condition, and also the length of the transition.) [...] To find the length of the gradually varied flow transitions, iterate the “step length”, instead of height, at the boundary condition height until equations 4 and 5 agree. [...] (e.g. For an M1 Profile, position 1 would be the downstream condition <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> solve for position two where the height is equal to normal depth.) ...|$|E

2500|$|According to the Book of Exodus, God {{hardened}} Pharaoh's heart so {{he would}} {{be strong enough to}} persist in his unwillingness to release the people, so that God could manifest his great power and cause his power to be declared among the nations, so that other people would discuss it for generations afterward. In this view, the plagues were punishment for the Egyptians' long abuse of the Israelites, as well as proof that the gods of Egypt were false and powerless. If God triumphed over the gods of Egypt, a world power at that time, then the people of God would be strengthened in their faith, although they were a small people, and would not be tempted to follow the deities that God proved false. Exodus 9:15–16 (JPS Tanakh) portrays Yahweh explaining why he did not accomplish the freedom of the Israelites immediately: [...] "I could have stretched forth My hand and stricken you [...] and your people with pestilence, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have been effaced from the earth. Nevertheless I have spared you for this purpose: in order to show you My power and in order that My fame may resound throughout the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hadid studied {{mathematics}} at the American University of Beirut before moving, in 1972, to London {{to study}} at the Architectural Association School of Architecture. There she studied with Rem Koolhaas, Elia Zenghelis and Bernard Tschumi. [...] Her former professor, Koolhaas, described her at graduation as [...] "a planet in her own orbit." [...] Zenghelis described her as the most outstanding pupil he ever taught. ‘We called her {{the inventor of the}} 89 degrees. Nothing was ever at 90 degrees. She had spectacular vision. All the buildings were exploding into tiny little pieces." [...] He recalled that she was less interested in details, such as staircases. [...] "The way she drew a staircase you would smash your head against the ceiling, and the space was reducing and reducing, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> end up in the upper corner of the ceiling. She couldn’t care about tiny details. Her mind was on the broader pictures—when it came to the joinery she knew we could fix that later. She was right.’ Her fourth-year student project was a painting of a hotel {{in the form of a}} bridge, inspired by the works of the Russian suprematist artist Kazimir Malevich.|$|E
