5|$|Since an {{electron}} behaves as a wave, {{at a given}} velocity it has a characteristic de Broglie wavelength. This is given by λe=h/p where h is the Planck constant and p is the momentum.

5|$|The {{production}} of energy at the core is the reason stars shine so brightly: every time two or more atomic nuclei fuse {{together to form a}} single <b>atomic</b> <b>nucleus</b> of a new heavier element, gamma ray photons are released from the nuclear fusion product. This energy is converted to other forms of electromagnetic energy of lower frequency, such as visible light, by the time it reaches the star's outer layers.|$|E
5|$|All the bound {{protons and}} {{neutrons}} in an atom {{make up a}} tiny <b>atomic</b> <b>nucleus,</b> and are collectively called nucleons. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07fm, where A is {{the total number of}} nucleons. This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 105fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more powerful than the electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.|$|E
2500|$|In nuclear physics, {{nuclear fusion}} is a {{reaction}} {{in which two}} or more <b>atomic</b> <b>nuclei</b> come close enough to form one or more different <b>atomic</b> <b>nuclei</b> and subatomic particles (neutrons or protons). The difference in mass between the reactants and products is manifested as the release of large amounts of energy. This difference in mass arises due to the difference in atomic [...] "binding energy" [...] between the <b>atomic</b> <b>nuclei</b> {{before and after the}} reaction.

40|$|For {{the first}} time we apply the methodologies of {{nonlinear}} analysis to investigate atomic matter. We use these methods in the analysis of Atomic Weights and of Mass Number of <b>atomic</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Using the AutoCorrelation Function and Mutual Information we establish the presence of nonlinear effects in the mechanism of increasing mass of <b>atomic</b> <b>nuclei</b> considered {{as a function of the}} atomic number. We find that increasing mass is divergent, possibly chaotic. We also investigate the possible existence of a Power Law for <b>atomic</b> <b>nuclei</b> and, using also the technique of the variogram, we conclude that a fractal regime could superintend to the mechanism of increasing mass for nuclei. Finally, using the Hurst exponent, evidence is obtained that the mechanism of increasing mass in <b>atomic</b> <b>nuclei</b> is in the fractional Brownian regime. The most interesting results are obtained by using Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA). New recurrences, psudoperiodicities, self-resemblance and class of self-similarities are identified with values of determinism showing oscillating values indicating the presence of more or less stability during the process of increasing mass of <b>atomic</b> <b>nuclei.</b> In brief, new regimes of regularities are identified for <b>atomic</b> <b>nuclei</b> that deserve to be studied by future researches. In particular an accurate analysis of binding energy values by nonlinear methods is further required. Comment: 42 pages including figure...|$|R

5|$|Bohr {{developed}} the Bohr {{model of the}} atom, in which he proposed that energy levels of electrons are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the <b>atomic</b> <b>nucleus</b> but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another. Although the Bohr model has been supplanted by other models, its underlying principles remain valid. He conceived the principle of complementarity: that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties, like behaving as a wave or a stream of particles. The notion of complementarity dominated Bohr's thinking in both science and philosophy.|$|E
5|$|For TypeII supernovae, the {{collapse}} is eventually halted by short-range repulsive neutron-neutron interactions, {{mediated by the}} strong force, {{as well as by}} degeneracy pressure of neutrons, at a density comparable to that of an <b>atomic</b> <b>nucleus.</b> When {{the collapse}} stops, the infalling matter rebounds, producing a shock wave that propagates outward. The energy from this shock dissociates heavy elements within the core. This reduces the energy of the shock, which can stall the explosion within the outer core.|$|E

This happens in conditions of temperatures over 100 megakelvin and helium concentration that the rapid expansion and cooling of the early universe prohibited, and therefore no significant carbon was created during the Big Bang.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, {{with the}} benefit of an Aitchison {{travelling}} scholarship from the University of Melbourne, Massey went to Trinity College, Cambridge to perform research at the Cavendish Laboratory led by Ernest Rutherford. The scholarship expired after two years, but he was awarded an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship in 1931. At this time the Cavendish Laboratory was one of the leading centres of physics in the world. In 1932 Cavendish laboratory scientists John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton split the <b>atomic</b> <b>nucleus,</b> James Chadwick discovered the neutron, and Patrick Blackett and Giuseppe Occhialini confirmed the existence of the positron.|$|E
5|$|In 1932 and 1933, the {{scientists}} at the Cavendish Laboratory {{made a series of}} ground-breaking discoveries. Cockroft and Walton bombarded lithium with high energy protons and succeeded in transmuting it into energetic nuclei of helium. This was one of the earliest experiments to change the <b>atomic</b> <b>nucleus</b> of one element to another by artificial means. Then Chadwick devised an experiment that discovered a new, uncharged particle with roughly the same mass as the proton: the neutron. In 1933, Blackett discovered tracks in his cloud chamber that confirmed the existence of the positron and revealed the opposing spiral traces of positron–electron pair production.|$|E

Under certain circumstances, the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force, and nucleons can be ejected from the nucleus, leaving behind a different element: nuclear decay resulting in nuclear transmutation.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of the Technical University of Berlin, Wigner worked {{as an assistant to}} Karl Weissenberg and Richard Becker at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, and David Hilbert at the University of Göttingen. Wigner and Hermann Weyl were responsible for introducing group theory into physics, particularly the theory of symmetry in physics. Along the way he performed ground-breaking work in pure mathematics, in which he authored a number of mathematical theorems. In particular, Wigner's theorem is a cornerstone in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. He is also known for his research into the structure of the <b>atomic</b> <b>nucleus.</b> In 1930, Princeton University recruited Wigner, along with John von Neumann, and he moved to the United States.|$|E

He then won a scholarship to St. John's College, Cambridge, where he sat the tripos exam in June 1924, becoming a wrangler. Ernest Rutherford accepted Cockcroft as a research student at the Cavendish Laboratory, and Cockcroft completed his doctorate under Rutherford's supervision in 1928. With Ernest Walton and Mark Oliphant he built {{what became known as}} a Cockcroft–Walton accelerator. Cockcroft and Walton used this to perform the first artificial disintegration of an <b>atomic</b> <b>nucleus,</b> a feat popularly known as splitting the atom.|$|E

5|$|Niels Bohr and John Archibald Wheeler {{applied the}} liquid drop {{model of the}} <b>atomic</b> <b>nucleus</b> to explain the {{mechanism}} of nuclear fission. As the experimental physicists studied fission, they uncovered puzzling results. George Placzek asked Bohr why uranium seemed to fission with both fast and slow neutrons. Walking to a meeting with Wheeler, Bohr had an insight that the fission at low energies {{was due to the}} uranium-235 isotope, while at high energies it was mainly due to the far more abundant uranium-238 isotope. The former makes up just 0.714 percent of the uranium atoms in natural uranium, about one in every 140; natural uranium is 99.28 percent uranium-238. There is also a tiny amount of uranium-234, which accounts for just 0.006 percent.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} protons and {{neutrons}} in the <b>atomic</b> <b>nucleus</b> can be modified, although this can require very high energies {{because of the}} strong force. Nuclear fusion occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus, such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei. For example, {{at the core of}} the Sun protons require energies of 3–10 keV to overcome their mutual repulsion—the coulomb barrier—and fuse together into a single nucleus. Nuclear fission is the opposite process, causing a nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei—usually through radioactive decay. The nucleus can also be modified through bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons. If this modifies the number of protons in a nucleus, the atom changes to a different chemical element.|$|E

Wheeler's Chapel Hill graduate student Katharine Way also presented a paper, which she followed up in a subsequent article, detailing how the liquid drop model was unstable under certain conditions. Due to a limitation of the liquid drop model, they all missed the opportunity to predict nuclear fission. The news of Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch's discovery of fission was brought to America by Bohr in 1939. Bohr told Leon Rosenfeld, who informed Wheeler.|$|E
