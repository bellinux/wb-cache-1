Instituting and sustaining cytology-based programs {{in these regions}} can be difficult, due {{to the need for}} trained personnel, equipment and facilities and difficulties in follow-up. With VIA, results and treatment can be available on the same day. As <b>a</b> <b>screening</b> <b>test,</b> VIA is comparable to cervical cytology in accurately identifying precancerous lesions.|$|E

25|$|This test mildly {{activates}} {{the contact}} phase of haemostasis. The result {{is influenced by}} coagulation factors, platelets, fibrinogen and heparin. Low molecular weight heparin is detected at higher concentrations. In the absence of heparin, INTEM is <b>a</b> <b>screening</b> <b>test</b> for the haemostasis system.

25|$|The Pap smear {{can be used}} as <b>a</b> <b>screening</b> <b>test,</b> but {{is false}} {{negative}} in up to 50% of cases of cervical cancer. Confirmation of the diagnosis of cervical cancer or precancer requires a biopsy of the cervix. This is often done through colposcopy, a magnified visual inspection of the cervix aided by using a dilute acetic acid (e.g. vinegar) solution to highlight abnormal cells {{on the surface of the}} cervix. Medical devices used for biopsy of the cervix include punch forceps, SpiraBrush CX, SoftBiopsy, or Soft-ECC.|$|E

500|$|The {{bacillus}} causing tuberculosis, M. tuberculosis, {{was identified}} and described on 24 March 1882 by Robert Koch. He received the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1905 for this discovery. Koch {{did not believe}} the bovine (cattle) and human tuberculosis diseases were similar, which delayed the recognition of infected milk as a source of infection. Later, the risk of transmission from this source was dramatically reduced by the invention of the pasteurization process. Koch announced a glycerine extract of the tubercle bacilli as a [...] "remedy" [...] for tuberculosis in 1890, calling it [...] "tuberculin". While it was not effective, it was later successfully adapted as <b>a</b> <b>screening</b> <b>test</b> for the presence of pre-symptomatic tuberculosis. The World Tuberculosis Day was established on 24 March for this reason.|$|E

2500|$|The {{immunosuppressive}} {{effect of the}} natural product cyclosporin was discovered in December 1971 in <b>a</b> <b>screening</b> <b>test</b> on immune suppression designed and implemented by Hartmann F.

The success of the drug candidate ciclosporin in preventing organ rejection was shown in kidney transplants by R.Y. Calne and colleagues at the University of Cambridge, and in liver transplants performed by Thomas Starzl at the University of Pittsburgh Hospital. The first patient, on 9 March 1980, was a 28-year-old woman. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ciclosporin for clinical use in 1983.|$|E

On completion of his BUD/S training, Ventura was assigned to a UDT team. In 1983, eight years after Ventura left the Navy, the UDTs were disbanded and those operators were retrained and retasked as SEALs.|$|E
2500|$|Visual acuity {{depends upon}} how {{accurately}} light {{is focused on}} the retina, the integrity of the eye's neural elements, and the interpretative faculty of the brain. [...] "Normal" [...] visual acuity (in central, i.e. foveal vision) is frequently considered to be what was defined by Herman Snellen as the ability to recognize an optotype when it subtended 5 minutes of arc, that is Snellen's chart 6/6 meter, 20/20 feet, 1.00 decimal or 0.0 logMAR. In young humans, the average visual acuity of a healthy, emmetropic eye (or ametropic eye with correction) is approximately 6/5 to 6/4, so it is inaccurate to refer to 6/6 visual acuity as [...] "perfect" [...] vision. 6/6 is the visual acuity needed to discriminate two contours separated by 1 arc minute- 1.75mm at 6 meters. This is because a 6/6 letter, E for example, has three limbs and two spaces in between them, giving 5 different detailed areas. The ability to resolve this therefore requires 1/5 of the letter's total size, which in this case would be 1 minute (visual angle). The significance of the 6/6 standard can best be thought of as the lower limit of normal or as a screening cutoff. When used as <b>a</b> <b>screening</b> <b>test,</b> subjects that reach this level need no further investigation, even though the average visual acuity with a healthy visual system is typically better.|$|E
