All cell lines showed {{high levels of}} resistance to the selecting drug and cross-resistance to the other drugs and to actinomycin D. Double-minute chromosomes could be identified on chromosomal spreads of these multidrug-resistant KB cell lines. Amplification of specific DNA sequences was demonstrated by using the technique of in-gel renaturation. All the cell lines share common <b>amplified</b> <b>sequences.</b> There are also <b>amplified</b> <b>sequences</b> that are specific for each cell line.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} the amplification of the CAD gene in independently isolated N-(phosphonacetyl) -L-aspartate-resistant clones derived from single parental clones in two mouse cell lines. We {{report for the}} first time that the CAD gene is amplified unstably in mouse cells, that the degree of instability varies greatly between clones, and that minute chromosomes and highly unstable chromosomelike structures contain the <b>amplified</b> <b>sequences.</b> These data are most consistent with the idea that the amplified unit in each clone consists of different flanking DNA and that such differences engender <b>amplified</b> <b>sequences</b> with unequal stability. We also introduced the mouse chromosome containing the CAD gene into hamster cells by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer to determine whether the propensity for unstable extrachromosomal amplification of the mouse CAD gene would prevail in the hamster cell nuclear environment. We report that the mouse CAD gene was amplified stably in expanded chromosomal regions in each of seven hybrids that were analyzed.

Amplification of the MYCN oncogene in this tumor is detected in 25 to 30 % of cases and is associated with poor clinical outcome. In this study, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} were used to determine MYCN amplification status in 46 neuroblastoma tumors. MYCN amplification was detected in tumors from 11 patients.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a methotrexate-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHOC 400) containing a 500 -fold amplification of a 135 -kilobase chromosomal DNA sequence. This sequence includes the gene for dihydrofolate reductase (tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, 5, 6, 7, 8 -tetrahydrofolate: NADP+ oxidoreductase, EC 1. 5. 1. 3). The high copy number of the <b>amplified</b> <b>sequence</b> permits it to be visualized as a distinct series of restriction fragments in genomic digests separated on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels. Initiation of DNA replication in the <b>amplified</b> <b>sequence</b> was studied by radiolabeling DNA synthesized during the onset of S phase in synchronized CHOC 400 cells. Autoradiography of Southern blots of labeled genomic digests shows that DNA synthesis initiates in a small subset of the EcoRI fragments derived from the amplified units. These early labeled fragments are not synthesized at later times during S phase, when different subsets of fragments are synthesized. Regardless of the drug used to collect cells {{at the beginning of}} S phase, the replication pattern observed remains the same.

A clone of 4. 3 kb that contained a highly repetitive sequence was isolated and cut with three restriction enzymes: Hae III, Rsa I, and Sau 3 A. After a new molecular cloning step, we isolated and sequenced a l 40 -basepair (bp) fragment. Two oligonucleotides were synthesized {{to be used}} as primers for a polymerase chain reaction. Using this probe, we detected an amount of DNA equivalent to one promastigote of L. infantum.

In passages 46 - 62 of the cells, the cells contain <b>amplified</b> c-myc <b>sequences</b> on submicroscopic circular extrachromosomal DNA (episomes).

40|$|We present two {{examples}} of exponential nucleic acid amplification with the poly-merase chain reaction (PCR) {{in the presence of}} only one amplification primer. Cloning and sequencing of the PCR products generated by amplification of human genomic DNA re-vealed that the <b>amplified</b> <b>sequence</b> contained only one primer and its complement, at the two ends of the PCR product. Although these experiments were performed with primers derived from the sequence of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) gene and the normal epithelial cell-specific 1 gene (NES 1), the am-plified sequences were novel and had no homology with either PSA or NES 1 DNA. While both PSA and NES 1 genes reside on chromosome 19 q 13. 3 -q 13. 4, the amplified sequences were found by mapping to reside on chromosome 5 q 12 and 5 p 15. 1 -p 15. 3, re-spectively. When we examined the mecha-nism of amplification by PCR using one primer in these two cases, we found that there was a high homology between the PSA primer or the NES 1 primer and the two re-gions flanking the <b>amplified</b> <b>sequence</b> of chromosome 5 q 12 or 5 p 15. This indicated that the single PSA or NES 1 primer could anneal on both strands of the DNA of that region, and mediate the exponential amplifi-cation.
