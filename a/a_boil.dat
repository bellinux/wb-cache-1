5|$|The boiling frog is {{a parable}} {{describing}} a frog being slowly boiled alive. The {{premise is that}} if a frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, but if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used {{as a metaphor for the}} inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of threats that arise gradually.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City {{spent the}} week {{preceding}} the final at a {{training camp in}} Eastbourne. Two days before the final Bert Trautmann, who had originally arrived in England as a prisoner of war, was named Footballer of the Year. Eight players who had played in the previous year's final were selected in the starting line-up. Press speculation {{in the run-up to}} the match pondered which of Don Revie and Bobby Johnstone would be selected, as Johnstone had been suffering from a calf problem. Bill Leivers was also an injury doubt due to a twisted ankle, and Billy Spurdle had <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> on his left arm lanced on the eve of the final. Consequently, the Manchester City line-up was not named until the morning of the match. Leivers was passed fit after having two pain-killing injections, but contrary to press expectations Spurdle missed out. This meant both Revie and Johnstone appeared in the line-up, Johnstone switching to outside right.|$|E
5|$|The sociopolitical {{atmosphere}} of Chicago {{was one of}} ethnic tension caused by competition among many new groups. With the Great Migration, thousands of African Americans from the South had settled next to neighborhoods of European immigrants on Chicago's South Side, near jobs in the stockyards and meatpacking plants. The Irish had been established first, and fiercely defended their territory and political power against all newcomers. Post World War I tensions caused frictions between the races, especially in the competitive labor and housing markets. Overcrowding and increased African American militancy by veterans contributed to the visible racial frictions. Also, a combination of ethnic gangs and police neglect strained the racial relationships. According to official reports, the turmoil came to <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> {{after the death of}} an African American youth who had accidentally drifted into a swimming area at an informally segregated beach. Tensions between groups arose in a melee that blew up into days of unrest.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, many colleges and school districts across Florida remained closed. President George W. Bush declared all of Florida a federal disaster area. Kennedy Space Center did not restore its complete work force until September 13 due to relief operations, as well as a lack of gasoline, ice, and water in the area. A total of 8000 members of the National Guard helped out with recovery efforts soon after the storm left the Florida peninsula. Residents in the areas of impact after the storm were under <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> water order, {{because of the lack of}} electricity to area water systems. Churches prepared meals for those without power and food themselves. Federal employees were granted excused absences if they helped with law enforcement and the cleanup. Thousands of portable generators were sent to the state by Home Depot and Lowe's home improvement stores. The United States Army Corps of Engineers installed blue tarpaulins on 41,556 damaged roofs statewide. Damage to the Florida citrus crop caused orange futures to rise four cents a pound due to Frances.|$|E

25|$|The District {{had been}} battling its staff {{annually}} over summer lay-offs and this, {{coupled with the}} pay equity concept in vogue at the time (“Comparable Worth”) came to <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> when their contract expired in summer, ’81. Right {{in the middle of}} the strike was held election for three School Board members. As well as walking picket lines daily, members endorsed incumbent Joe Canciamilla (now a member of the State Assembly) and newcomer Dana Hunt (a county sheriff and union member). Their election was pivotal in settling a strike that gained a contract with wage increases that exceeded the CoLA, redressed imbalances in the male-female hourly rate inequities and provided lay-off protections for summer workers.|$|E

25|$|Variations on {{the flavor}} are gained by adding root {{vegetables}} such as parsnip, potato, sweet potato and celery root, herbs such as parsley, dill, other vegetables such as zucchini, whole garlic cloves or tomatoes and black pepper. The soup {{should be brought}} slowly to <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> and then simmered in a covered pot on a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. A clearer broth is achieved by skimming the drops of fat {{off the top of}} the soup as it is cooking, first bringing the chicken to boil from a pot of cold water and discarding the water before continuing, or straining it through a strainer or cheesecloth. Saffron or turmeric are sometimes added as a yellow colorant. Then, the chicken can be shredded by hand and stored in the refrigerator until ready for use in the soup.|$|E
25|$|Joseph is {{infected}} with <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> {{that turns out}} to be the Empress, a Stand controlled by Nena, but outsmarts the foe. En route to Pakistan the party battles Wheel of Fortune, a car Stand controlled by ZZ. Enya, mother of J. Geil, uses her Stand Justice to avenge her son, sending an army of animated dead after Polnareff and Jotaro. In Karachi, Steely Dan uses The Lovers to hold Joseph hostage, forcing Jotaro into the role of personal manservant. Arabia Fats, user of The Sun, attempts to thwart the group in the Arabian Desert but is discovered and easily defeated. The group is soon saddled with the baby Mannish Boy, who uses his Stand, Death 13, to attack in dreams. Only through Kakyoin's quick thinking does the group survive the baby's dreamworld; afterwards, Kakyoin punishes Mannish Boy by tricking Joseph and Polnareff into feeding the baby his own feces. On an island in the Red Sea, Polnareff is accosted by the genie Stand Judgment, but the previously assumed dead Avdol returns and saves him. Avdol appropriates a submarine, but the vehicle is infiltrated by the High Priestess, a Stand controlled by Midler that can take the form of anything metallic; however, Star Platinum's power easily defeats it.|$|E
25|$|Adults {{are large}} flies, and unusual amongst brachyceran flies {{because they have}} a dense {{covering}} of fine setae (like hairs) and colored patterns that make them appear like bumble-bees (Hymenoptera). All species of the Oestridae are so highly adapted to the myiasis type of parasitism that the adults do not feed and have only residual mouthparts (see photograph of Hypoderma iparece). All these flies have an obligate myiasis life-cycle, with a complete metamorphosis. The females lay eggs with high selectivity on their special hosts and at specific sites there. For example, eggs laid on the legs of horses in the case of species of Gasterophilus. The horse licks at the irritated skin and the larvae transfer to the mouth of horse. The larvae penetrate tissues in the oral cavity, feed parasitically whilst migrating through tissue of the esophagus to finally reach the stomach. The final larval stage is completed with the larvae attached to the mucosa of the horse's stomach. When ready to pupate the larvae detach and are voided in the horse's feces. Another example is Dermatobia hominis, torsalo-fly, which is an important parasite of cattle, and sometimes humans, in tropical regions of South America. The larvae cause a localized, furuncular (= like <b>a</b> <b>boil)</b> myiasis in the skin of their hosts. The larvae infest these sites when transported there accidentally by blood feeding mosquitoes; the adult female Dermatobia flies lay their eggs on the legs of mosquitoes, a dispersal mechanism called phoresy.|$|E

50|$|When {{comparing}} a polar and {{nonpolar molecule}} with similar molar masses, the polar molecule in general has <b>a</b> higher <b>boiling</b> point, because the dipole-dipole interaction between polar molecules results in stronger intermolecular attractions. One {{common form of}} polar interaction is the hydrogen bond, which {{is also known as}} the H-bond. For example, water forms H-bonds and has a molar mass M = 18 and <b>a</b> <b>boiling</b> point of +100 °C, compared to nonpolar methane with M = 16 and <b>a</b> <b>boiling</b> point of -161 °C.|$|R

25|$|In 2004, Minichiello {{was again}} {{selected}} {{to play for}} New South Wales but just five days out from Game I he was sacked for taking a mobile telephone out contrary to team instructions during a wild bonding session. However he fought his {{way back into the}} squad and help steered New South Wales to its second series victory. He was named the Dally M Fullback of the Year in the 2004 NRL season, where he scored a career best 18 tries for the season. He also won the Harry Sunderland Medal as the player's player of the year. Mini went on to play at fullback for the Roosters in their 16–13 loss to the Bulldogs in the 2004 NRL Grand Final. It was the Roosters third Grand Final loss in four games since 2000. Minichiello was selected in the Australian team to go and compete in the end of season 2004 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament. In the final against Great Britain he played at fullback and scored two tries in the Kangaroos' 44–4 victory. Another great season followed in 2005, where Minichiello's performances at fullback for NSW resulted in him winning the Wally Lewis Medal for player of the 2005 State of Origin series. The year was capped off with him winning the Harry Sunderland Medal again as the man of the 2005 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament, despite New Zealand causing <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> over by defeating Australia 24–0 in the Final at Elland Road in Leeds (it was the first time since 1972 that Australia had not won an international series or tournament in which they played). The game would also prove to be Anthony Minichiello's 18th and final test for Australia. He would go on to win the 2005 Golden Boot Award as the international player of the year.|$|E
