50|$|The dynamic power {{dissipated}} by {{an electronic}} circuit is {{directly proportional to}} the <b>activity</b> <b>factor</b> and the load capacitance as seen by {{the output of the}} logic gate. In case of a bus, the load capacitance is usually high since bus needs to be connected to multiple modules and routed longer and the <b>activity</b> <b>factor</b> is also high. Due to higher value of load capacitance and <b>activity</b> <b>factor,</b> in a typical system, bus power consumption can contribute up to 50% of the total power consumption. Bus encoding aims to reduce this power by reducing the amount of activity (number of toggles) in the bus lines. While the kind of bus encoding to be used for a particular system can be best determined when the target application and environmental constraints about the system are known apriori, described below are some bus encoding techniques which can help reduce bus power for most systems. Hence bus encoding is important for any electronic system design.|$|E

Male Wistar rats were sensitized intraperitoneally on days 0, 7, and 14 and challenged to ovalbumin intratracheally on day 21. Groups of sensitized rats were treated randomly either with placebo, puerarin, dexamethasone, or puerarin combined with dexamethasone, from days 15 to 20. Inflammatory markers, including cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), inflammatory cytokines, histopathology, and coagulation parameters, such as coagulation tests and the <b>activity</b> of coagulation <b>factors,</b> were analyzed. Results. Puerarin significantly inhibited the recruitment of inflammatory cells in BALF and lung tissue. At the same time, the release of IL- 4, IL- 10, and IFN-γ in serum and the expression of mRNAs in lung tissue homogenate were changed by puerarin. Administration of puerarin also effectively rectified the coagulation disorder in asthmatic rats, such as prothrombin time (PT) (P< 0. 01), thrombin time (TT) (P< 0. 05), fibrinogen (FIB) (P< 0. 01),the <b>activity</b> of <b>factor</b> II (FII) (P< 0. 01), the <b>activity</b> of <b>factor</b> V (FV) (P< 0. 05), the <b>activity</b> of <b>factor</b> VII (FVII) (P< 0. 05), the <b>activity</b> of <b>factor</b> X (FX) (P< 0. 05), the <b>activity</b> of <b>factor</b> VIII (FVIII) (P< 0. 01), the <b>activity</b> of <b>factor</b> IX (FIX) (P< 0. 05), and the <b>activity</b> of <b>factor</b> XII (FXII) (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse and compare the <b>activity</b> of <b>factor</b> V, VIII and {{fibrinogen}} level in fresh frozen plasma and frozen plasma frozen after 8 hrs but within 24 hours after phlebotomy. Materials and Methods: Fresh frozen plasma separated from whole blood within 8 hours was compared with plasma separated within 24 hours after phlebotomy in terms of coagulation factors V and VIII and level of fibrinogen by standard methods using semi automated coagulometer sysmex CA 50. Results: Longer storage of whole blood before processing resulted in significant decrease (18. 4 %) in <b>activity</b> of <b>factor</b> VIII but the fall in <b>activity</b> of <b>factor</b> V (6. 52 %) or level of fibrinogen (1. 81 %) was not significant.
