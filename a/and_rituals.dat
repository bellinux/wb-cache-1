5|$|Ancient Egyptian deities are {{the gods}} and goddesses worshipped in ancient Egypt. The beliefs <b>and</b> <b>rituals</b> {{surrounding}} these gods formed the core of ancient Egyptian religion, which emerged sometime in prehistory. Deities represented natural forces and phenomena, and the Egyptians supported and appeased them through offerings <b>and</b> <b>rituals</b> so that these forces would continue to function according to maat, or divine order. After {{the founding of the}} Egyptian state around 3100BC, the authority to perform these tasks was controlled by the pharaoh, who claimed to be the gods' representative and managed the temples where the rituals were carried out.|$|E
5|$|Hiltebeitel {{argues that}} the Kuttantavar cult might {{represent}} the original Tamil tradition regarding Aravan, however {{it is no longer}} the only tradition that venerates Aravan. The Draupadi cult has developed traditions <b>and</b> <b>rituals</b> of its own.|$|E
5|$|Influenced by the Völkisch movement, {{the regime}} was against {{cultural}} modernism {{and supported the}} development of an extensive military at the expense of intellectualism. Creativity and art were stifled, except where they could serve as propaganda media. The party used symbols such as the Blood Flag <b>and</b> <b>rituals</b> such as the Nazi Party rallies to foster unity and bolster the regime's popularity.|$|E

5000|$|In {{traditional}} societies, myth <b>and</b> <b>ritual</b> are two central {{components of}} religious practice. Although myth <b>and</b> <b>ritual</b> are commonly united {{as parts of}} religion, the exact relationship between them has {{been a matter of}} controversy among scholars. One of the approaches to this problem is [...] "the myth <b>and</b> <b>ritual,</b> or myth-ritualist, theory," [...] held notably by the so-called Cambridge Ritualists, which holds that [...] "myth does not stand by itself but is tied to ritual." [...] This theory is still disputed; many scholars now believe that myth <b>and</b> <b>ritual</b> share common paradigms, but not that one developed from the other.|$|R
5000|$|Following World War II, the {{semantic}} study of myth <b>and</b> <b>ritual,</b> particularly by Bill Stanner and Victor Turner, has supported {{a connection between}} myth <b>and</b> <b>ritual.</b> However, it has not supported the notion that one preceded and produced the other, as supporters of the [...] "primacy of ritual" [...] hypothesis would claim. According to the currently dominant scholarly view, the link between myth <b>and</b> <b>ritual</b> is that they share common paradigms.|$|R
5|$|According to {{historian}} Paolo Delogu {{it may be}} that Agnellus' narrative better reflects Lombard {{oral tradition}} than Paul's. In his interpretation, Paul's narrative represents a late distortion of the Germanic myths <b>and</b> <b>rituals</b> contained in the oral tradition. In a telling consistent with Germanic tradition, it would be Helmichis who was seduced by the queen, and by sleeping with him Rosamund would pass Alboin's royal charisma magically to the king's prospective murderer. A symbol of this passage of powers is found in Paul's account of the assassin's entry: Alboin's inability to draw his sword represents here his loss of power.|$|E
5|$|Ant {{societies}} have division of labour, communication between individuals, {{and an ability}} to solve complex problems. These parallels with human {{societies have}} long been an inspiration and subject of study. Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, medication, <b>and</b> <b>rituals.</b> Some species are valued in their role as biological pest control agents. Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, as they can damage crops and invade buildings. Some species, such as the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), are regarded as invasive species, establishing themselves in areas where they have been introduced accidentally.|$|E
5|$|Aradia is {{composed}} of fifteen chapters, the first ten of which are presented as being Leland's translation of the Vangelo manuscript {{given to him by}} Maddalena. This section, while predominantly made up of spells <b>and</b> <b>rituals,</b> is also the source of most of the myths and folktales contained in the text. At the end of Chapter I is the text in which Aradia gives instructions to her followers on how to practice witchcraft.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the recent}} and {{intensified}} scholarly {{interest in the}} field of myth <b>and</b> <b>ritual,</b> inquiry into major shifts in mythical <b>and</b> <b>ritual</b> poetics is still in a preliminary stage. The essays in this collection advance our understanding considerably as they probe the intersections of myth <b>and</b> <b>ritual</b> with the plot of the novels. The volume will provide a substantial point of departure for subsequent research into freer models of interaction between literature and religion...|$|R
5000|$|Sir James George Frazer {{identified}} - or invented - {{the concept}} of the sacred king in his study The Golden Bough (1890-1915), the title of which refers to the myth of the Rex Nemorensis. Frazer gives numerous examples, cited below, and is regarded as an exponent of the myth <b>and</b> <b>ritual</b> school. However, [...] "the myth <b>and</b> <b>ritual,</b> or myth-ritualist, theory" [...] is disputed; many scholars now believe that myth <b>and</b> <b>ritual</b> share common paradigms, but not that one developed from the other.|$|R
5|$|Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches {{is a book}} {{composed}} by the American folklorist Charles Godfrey Leland that was published in 1899. It contains what he believed was the religious text {{of a group of}} pagan witches in Tuscany, Italy that documented their beliefs <b>and</b> <b>rituals,</b> although various historians and folklorists have disputed the existence of such a group. In the 20th century, the book was very influential {{in the development of the}} contemporary Pagan religion of Wicca. Aradia is also the name of a character in the webcomic Homestuck, created by Andrew Hussie.|$|E
5|$|Numerous deities {{have been}} {{considered}} patrons of third-sex or homoerotically-inclined people. This patronage can originate in mythological stories about the deity, or from religious practices <b>and</b> <b>rituals.</b> For example, Conner and Sparks argue that the goddess of fire, love and sexuality, Arani, {{has been linked to}} lesbian eroticism via rituals in her honor: for example two pieces of wood perceived as feminine, called the adhararani and utararani, are rubbed together, simulating a spiritual lesbian interaction.|$|E
5|$|The customs <b>and</b> <b>rituals</b> in Strandzha {{are related}} to {{specific}} days of the year, which in most cases coincide with the church holidays of the Christian calendar. They are traditionally divided into a summer (beginning on St George's Day, 6 May) and a winter period (beginning on St Demetrius' Day, 26 October). The largest festival in Strandzha is celebrated in mid-August in the historic area Petrova Niva in commemoration of the Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising.|$|E

5|$|The {{unearthed}} Antiquities (of art, architecture, customs <b>and</b> <b>rituals)</b> {{indicate that}} the prehistoric people of the Burzahom established contact with Central Asia and South West Asia and also had links to the Gangetic plains and peninsular India. The interaction of local and foreign influences is demonstrated by the art, architecture, customs, rituals and language demonstrated by some engravings on pottery and other artifacts. Some historians have stated that the Vedic Aryan culture extended into Kashmir, but archaeological investigation at Burzahom {{does not support the}} theory.|$|E
5|$|The word lesbian {{is derived}} from the name of the Greek island of Lesbos, home to the 6th-century BCE poet Sappho. From various ancient writings, historians {{gathered}} that a group of young women were left in Sappho's charge for their instruction or cultural edification. Little of Sappho's poetry survives, but her remaining poetry reflects the topics she wrote about: women's daily lives, their relationships, <b>and</b> <b>rituals.</b> She focused on the beauty of women and proclaimed her love for girls. Before the mid-19th century, the word lesbian referred to any derivative or aspect of Lesbos, including a type of wine.|$|E
5|$|Vimala is {{identified}} with the goddesses Katyayini, Durga, Bhairavi, Bhuvaneshvari and Ekanamsha in various texts <b>and</b> <b>rituals.</b> She is considered the shakti of Vishnu as well as Shiva in the climactic Durga Puja festivities in the temple. She appears as Mahishasuramardini (Durga as slayer of the demon Mahishasura) or Vijayalakshmi (the warrior form of Lakshmi) in New Delhi Konark stele, 13th century stone stele originally from Konark Sun Temple and now housed in National Museum, New Delhi.|$|E

5|$|Another legend {{tells the}} story of {{conversion}} of Chamunda into a Jain goddess. According to this story, Chamunda sculpted the Mahavira image for the temple in Osian, Jodhpur and was happy with the conversions of the Oswals to Jainism. At the time of Navratri, a festival that celebrates the Divine Mother, Chamunda expected animal sacrifices from the converted Jains. The vegetarian Jains, however, were unable to meet her demand. Ratnaprabhasuri intervened, and as a result, Chamunda accepted vegetarian offerings, forgoing her demand for meat and liquor. Ratnaprabhsuri further named her Sacciya, one who had told the truth, as Chamunda had told him the truth that a rainy season stay in Osian would be beneficial for him. She also became the protective goddess of the temple and remained the clan goddess, Kuladevi, of the Oswals. The Sachiya Mata Temple in Osian was built in her honour. Some Jain scriptures warn of dire consequences of worship of Chamunda by the Hindu rites <b>and</b> <b>rituals.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of a reserve {{battalion}} during World War I, Himmler did not see active service. He studied agronomy in college, and joined the Nazi Party in 1923 and the SS in 1925. In 1929, he was appointed Reichsführer-SS by Hitler. Over the next 16 years, he developed the SS from a mere 290-man battalion into a million-strong paramilitary group, and, following Hitler's orders, set up and controlled the Nazi concentration camps. He was known to have good organisational skills and for selecting highly competent subordinates, such as Reinhard Heydrich in 1931. From 1943 onwards, he was both Chief of German Police and Minister of the Interior, overseeing all internal and external police and security forces, including the Gestapo (Secret State Police). Himmler had a lifelong interest in occultism, interpreting Germanic neopagan and Völkisch beliefs to promote the racial policy of Nazi Germany, and incorporating esoteric symbolism <b>and</b> <b>rituals</b> into the SS.|$|E
5|$|During the Qin dynasty, {{the first}} Qin emperor's {{legitimacy}} to rule was ultimately decided by {{his ability to}} conquer others. However, {{by the time of}} Wang Mang's (r. 9–23 AD) reign, the Mandate of Heaven was considered the only legitimate source of imperial authority. This concept was given greater prominence after the state officially sponsored the worship of Heaven over that of the Five Powers in 31 BC. Moreover, the philosophy of the scholar Dong Zhongshu (179–104 BC), which held that a dynasty's rule on earth was bound to greater cosmological cycles in the universe, was officially sponsored by the Han court from Emperor Wu's (r. 141–87 BC) reign onward. The emperor was expected to behave according to proper ritual, ethics, and morals, lest he incur the wrath of Heaven and bring an end to his reign. He became the highest priest in the land. By performing certain religious rites <b>and</b> <b>rituals,</b> the emperor acted as a sacred link between Heaven and Earth.|$|E

5|$|For several months, Bachelot and {{his fellow}} missionaries lived in three small rented structures, saying their first mass on the island in a grass hut. They later built a chapel on a small plot of land they purchased, where the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace was {{dedicated}} in 1843. After settling on the island, the group avoided drawing attention to themselves and studied the Hawaiian language. During their mission's first two years, the group converted 65 Hawaiians and ministered to Hawaiians who had already been converted. They often held surreptitious night-time meetings with converts who feared persecution. The priests' vestments <b>and</b> <b>rituals</b> made their evangelism efforts more effective because they reminded Hawaiians of native religious customs.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people of}} the {{district}} follow the traditions, customs <b>and</b> <b>rituals.</b> The district has many temples of Hindu gods and goddesses, which are ancient and have deep spiritualism attached to them. The people of Dakshina Kannada worship the serpent god Subramanya. According to legend, the district was reclaimed by Parashurama from the sea. Nagaradhane or snake worship is practiced according to the popular belief of the Naga Devatha to go underground and guard the species on the top. Rituals such as Bhuta Kola are performed to satisfy the spirits. Kambala, a form of buffalo race on muddy track in the paddy field, is organised in the 16 sites across the district. Cock fight (Kori Katta in Tulu) is another past time of the rural agrarian people.|$|E
5|$|Nomadic {{hunter-gatherer}} societies passed on, by oral tradition, {{what they}} knew (their empirical observations) about {{the different kinds of}} plants that they used for food, shelter, poisons, medicines, for ceremonies <b>and</b> <b>rituals</b> etc. The uses of plants by these pre-literate societies influenced the way the plants were named and classifiedtheir uses were embedded in folk-taxonomies, the way they were grouped according to use in everyday communication. The nomadic life-style was drastically changed when settled communities were established in about twelve centres around the world during the Neolithic Revolution which extended from about 10,000 to 2500 years ago depending on the region. With these communities came the development of the technology and skills needed for the domestication of plants and animals and the emergence of the written word provided evidence for the passing of systematic knowledge and culture {{from one generation to the}} next.|$|E
