25|$|In MFC operation, the anode is the {{terminal}} electron acceptor recognized by {{bacteria in the}} <b>anodic</b> chamber. Therefore, the microbial activity {{is strongly dependent on}} the anode's redox potential. A Michaelis-Menten curve was obtained between the <b>anodic</b> potential and the power output of an acetate-driven MFC. A critical <b>anodic</b> potential seems to provide maximum power output.|$|E
25|$|Attempts {{to save a}} metal from {{becoming}} <b>anodic</b> are of two general types. <b>Anodic</b> regions dissolve and destroy the structural integrity of the metal.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anodic</b> {{protection}} impresses <b>anodic</b> current on {{the structure}} to be protected (opposite to the cathodic protection). It is appropriate for metals that exhibit passivity (e.g. stainless steel) and suitably small passive current {{over a wide range}} of potentials. It is used in aggressive environments, such as solutions of sulfuric acid.|$|E
25|$|The <b>anodic</b> {{generated}} insulating {{oxide layer}} is destroyed if the polarity of the applied voltage changes.|$|E
25|$|H. littorale has {{two types}} of {{hemoglobin}}, <b>anodic</b> and cathodic; <b>anodic</b> hemoglobin has a relatively low oxygen affinity and has marked Bohr effects, while cathodic hemoglobin lack significant pH effects. In H. littorale, cathodic hemoglobin has a pronounced reversed Bohr effect in which oxygen affinity increases with decreased pH. Cathodic hemoglobin has the purpose of safeguarding oxygen transport to tissues under hypoxic and acidotic conditions.|$|E
25|$|Normally the anode foil {{is covered}} by the {{dielectric}} aluminum oxide (Al2O3) layer, which protects the base aluminum metal against the aggressiveness of aqueous alkali solutions. However, some impurities or weak points in the oxide layer offer the possibility for water-driven <b>anodic</b> corrosion that forms aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3). In e-caps using an alkaline electrolyte this aluminum hydroxide will not be transformed into the desired stable form of aluminum oxide. The weak point remains and the <b>anodic</b> corrosion is ongoing. This corrosive process can be interrupted by protective substances in the electrolyte known as inhibitors or passivators. Inhibitors—such as chromates, phosphates, silicates, nitrates, fluorides, benzoates, soluble oils, and certain other chemicals—can reduce the <b>anodic</b> and cathodic corrosion reactions. However, if inhibitors are used in an insufficient amount, they tend to increase pitting.|$|E
25|$|The redox {{potentials}} of C60 can {{be modified}} supramolecularly. A dibenzo-18-crown-6 derivative of C60 has been made, featuring a voltage sensor device, with the reversible binding of K+ ion causing an <b>anodic</b> shift of 90mV of the first C60 reduction.|$|E
25|$|Under many {{application}} conditions copper {{is higher}} on the galvanic series than other common structural metals, meaning that copper wire {{is less likely to}} be corroded in wet conditions. However, any more <b>anodic</b> metals in contact with copper will be corroded since will essentially be sacrificed to the copper.|$|E
25|$|Every wet {{chemistry}} cell has 26 chemical sensors and a temperature sensor. The polymer Ion Selective Electrodes {{were able to}} determine the concentration of ions by measuring the change of electric potential within the sensor, which is separated from the {{wet chemistry}} cell by an ion selective membrane. The two gas sensing electrodes for oxygen and carbon dioxide work on the same principle and are separated from the wet chemistry cell by a gas permeable membrane. A gold micro-electrode array {{is used for the}} Cyclic voltammetry and <b>Anodic</b> Stripping Voltammetry. Cyclic voltammetry is a method to study ions by applying a waveform of varying potential and measuring the current-voltage curve. <b>Anodic</b> Stripping Voltammetry first deposits the metals onto the gold electrode with an applied potential. After the potential is reversed, the current is measured while the metals are stripped off the electrode.|$|E
25|$|Copper {{building}} wire {{is compatible}} with brass and quality plated screws. The wire provides connections that will not corrode or creep. It is not, however, compatible with aluminium wire or connectors. If the two metals are joined, a galvanic reaction can occur. <b>Anodic</b> corrosion during the reaction can disintegrate the aluminium. This is why most appliance and electrical equipment manufacturers use copper lead wires for connections to building wiring systems.|$|E
25|$|The use of CFCs as {{solvents}} for {{dry cleaning}} have been phased out, for example, by the IPPC directive on greenhouse gases in 1994 {{and by the}} volatile organic compounds (VOC) directive of the EU in 1997. In the meantime electrolytic systems have been developed with additives to inhibit the reaction between <b>anodic</b> aluminum oxide and water, which solve most of the high leakage current problems after storage.|$|E
25|$|Pitting {{results when}} a small hole, or cavity, forms in the metal, usually {{as a result of}} de-passivation of a small area. This area becomes <b>anodic,</b> while part of the {{remaining}} metal becomes cathodic, producing a localized galvanic reaction. The deterioration of this small area penetrates the metal and can lead to failure. This form of corrosion is often difficult to detect {{due to the fact that}} it is usually relatively small and may be covered and hidden by corrosion-produced compounds.|$|E
25|$|Ferrocenium salts are {{sometimes}} used as oxidizing agents, {{in part because}} the product ferrocene is fairly inert and readily separated from ionic products. Substituents on the cyclopentadienyl ligands alters the redox potential in the expected way: electron-withdrawing groups such as a carboxylic acid shift the potential in the <b>anodic</b> direction (i.e. made more positive), whereas electron-releasing groups such as methyl groups shift the potential in the cathodic direction (more negative). Thus, decamethylferrocene is much more easily oxidised than ferrocene and can even be oxidised to the corresponding dication. Ferrocene is often used as an internal standard for calibrating redox potentials in non-aqueous electrochemistry.|$|E
25|$|One major {{industrial}} application involves use of activated carbon {{in the metal}} finishing field. It is very widely employed for purification of electroplating solutions. For example, it is a main purification technique for removing organic impurities from bright nickel plating solutions. A variety of organic chemicals are added to plating solutions for improving their deposit qualities and for enhancing properties like brightness, smoothness, ductility, etc. Due to passage of direct current and electrolytic reactions of <b>anodic</b> oxidation and cathodic reduction, organic additives generate unwanted breakdown products in solution. Their excessive build up can adversely affect the plating quality and physical properties of deposited metal. Activated carbon treatment removes such impurities and restores plating performance to the desired level.|$|E
25|$|Most metals {{occur in}} nature in their {{oxidized}} form (ores) and thus must {{be reduced to}} their metallic forms. The ore is dissolved following some preprocessing in an aqueous electrolyte or in a molten salt and the resulting solution is electrolyzed. The metal is deposited on the cathode (either in solid or in liquid form), while the <b>anodic</b> reaction is usually oxygen evolution. Several metals are naturally present as metal sulfides; these include copper, lead, molybdenum, cadmium, nickel, silver, cobalt, and zinc. In addition, gold and platinum group metals are associated with sulfidic base metal ores. Most metal sulfides or their salts, are electrically conductive and this allows electrochemical redox reactions to efficiently occur in the molten state or in aqueous solutions.|$|E
25|$|Another price {{explosion}} for tantalum in 2000/2001 {{forced the}} development of niobium electrolytic capacitors with manganese dioxide electrolyte, which have been available since 2002. Niobium is a sister metal to tantalum and serves as valve metal generating an oxide layer during <b>anodic</b> oxidation. Niobium as raw material is much more abundant in nature than tantalum and is less expensive. It {{was a question of}} the availability of the base metal in the late 1960s which led to development and implementation of niobium electrolytic capacitors in the former Soviet Union instead of tantalum capacitors as in the West. The materials and processes used to produce niobium-dielectric capacitors are essentially the same as for existing tantalum-dielectric capacitors. The characteristics of niobium electrolytic capacitors and tantalum electrolytic capacitors are roughly comparable.|$|E
500|$|One {{material}} {{used for}} <b>anodic</b> material of nickel-metal hydride batteries is [...] Due to high cost {{to extract the}} other lanthanides, a mischmetal with more than 50% of lanthanum is used instead of pure lanthanum. [...] The compound is an intermetallic component of the [...] type.|$|E
500|$|A typical implant {{consists}} of a titanium screw (resembling a tooth root) with a roughened or smooth surface. The majority of dental implants are made out of commercially pure titanium, which is available in four grades depending upon the amount of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and iron contained. Cold work hardened CP4 (maximum impurity limits of N [...]05 percent, C [...]10 percent, H [...]015 percent, Fe [...]50 percent, and O [...]40 percent) is {{the most commonly used}} titanium for implants. Grade 5 titanium, Titanium 6AL-4V, (signifying the titanium alloy containing 6 percent aluminium and 4 percent vanadium alloy) is slightly harder than CP4 and used in the industry mostly for abutment screws and abutments. Most modern dental implants also have a textured surface (through etching, <b>anodic</b> oxidation or various-media blasting) to increase the surface area and osseointegration potential of the implant.|$|E
500|$|When {{steel is}} {{immersed}} in water, adding a small concentration (55ppm) of potassium pertechnetate(VII) {{to the water}} protects the steel from corrosion, even if the temperature is raised to [...] For this reason, pertechnetate {{has been used as}} an <b>anodic</b> corrosion inhibitor for steel, although technetium's radioactivity poses problems that limit this application to self-contained systems. While (for example) [...] can also inhibit corrosion, it requires a concentration ten times as high. In one experiment, a specimen of carbon steel was kept in an aqueous solution of pertechnetate for 20years and was still uncorroded. The mechanism by which pertechnetate prevents corrosion is not well understood, but seems to involve the reversible formation of a thin surface layer (passivation). One theory holds that the pertechnetate reacts with the steel surface to form a layer of technetium dioxide which prevents further corrosion; the same effect explains how iron powder can be used to remove pertechnetate from water. (Activated carbon can also be used for the same purpose.) The effect disappears rapidly if the concentration of pertechnetate falls below the minimum concentration or if too high a concentration of other ions is added.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is used in}} {{industry}} for corrosion inhibition, {{as it is a}} non-oxidizing <b>anodic</b> inhibitor. [...] The addition of sodium molybdate significantly reduces the nitrite requirement of fluids inhibited with nitrite-amine, and improves the corrosion protection of carboxylate salt fluids.|$|E
2500|$|Electrolytic {{capacitors}} use {{a chemical}} feature of some special metals, earlier called “valve metals”, on which by <b>anodic</b> oxidation (forming) an insulating oxide layer originates {{and serves as}} dielectric. There are three different anode metals in use for electrolytic capacitors: ...|$|E
2500|$|Nearly {{all animals}} {{have more than}} one kind of Hb present in the RBC. Multiple Hb isoforms (see isoforms) are {{particularly}} common in ectotherms, but especially in fish that are required to cope with both fluctutating temperature and oxygen availability. Hbs isolated from the European eel can be separated into <b>anodic</b> and cathodic isoforms. The <b>anodic</b> isoforms have low oxygen affinities (high P50) and marked Bohr effects, while the cathodic lack significant pH effects and are therefore thought to confer hypoxia tolerance. [...] Several species of African cichlids raised from early stage development under either hypoxic or normoxic conditions were contrasted in an attempt to compare Hb isoforms. They demonstrated there were Hb isoforms specific to the hypoxia-raised individuals.|$|E
2500|$|A method {{commonly}} used to protect a structural metal is to attach a metal which is more <b>anodic</b> than the metal to be protected. This forces the structural metal to be cathodic, thus spared corrosion. It is called [...] "sacrificial" [...] because the anode dissolves {{and has to be}} replaced periodically.|$|E
2500|$|Soil-based {{microbial}} {{fuel cells}} {{adhere to the}} basic MFC principles, whereby soil acts as the nutrient-rich <b>anodic</b> media, the inoculum and the proton exchange membrane (PEM). [...] The anode is placed at a particular depth within the soil, while the cathode rests on top the soil and is exposed to air.|$|E
2500|$|Corrosion inhibitors, such as calcium nitrite , {{can also}} {{be added to the}} water mix before pouring concrete. Generally, 1–2wt.% of [...] with respect to cement weight is needed to prevent {{corrosion}} of the rebars. The nitrite anion is a mild oxidizer that oxidizes the soluble and mobile ferrous ions (Fe2+) present at the surface of the corroding steel and causes them to precipitate as an insoluble ferric hydroxide (Fe(OH)3). This causes the passivation of steel at the <b>anodic</b> oxidation sites. Nitrite is a much more active corrosion inhibitor than nitrate, which is a less powerful oxidizer of the divalent iron.|$|E
2500|$|Tracking dye; as {{proteins}} and nucleic acids are mostly colorless, their {{progress through the}} gel during electrophoresis cannot be easily followed. Anionic dyes of a known electrophoretic mobility are therefore usually included in the PAGE sample buffer. A very common tracking dye is Bromophenol blue (BPB, 3',3",5',5" [...] tetrabromophenolsulfonphthalein). This dye is coloured at alkali and neutral pH and is a small negatively charged molecule that moves towards the anode. Being a highly mobile molecule it moves ahead of most proteins. As it reaches the <b>anodic</b> end of the electrophoresis medium electrophoresis is stopped. It can weakly bind to some {{proteins and}} impart a blue colour. [...] Other common tracking dyes are xylene cyanol, which has lower mobility, and Orange G, which has a higher mobility.|$|E
2500|$|In an EBPVD system, the {{deposition}} chamber must be evacuated to a pressure {{of at least}} 7.5 Torr (10−2 Pa) to allow passage of electrons from the electron gun to the evaporation material, which {{can be in the}} form of an ingot or rod. Alternatively, some modern EBPVD systems utilize an arc-suppression system and can be operated at vacuum levels as low as 5.0 Torr, for situations such as parallel use with magnetron sputtering. [...] Multiple types of evaporation materials and electron guns can be used simultaneously in a single EBPVD system, each having a power from tens to hundreds of kilowatts. Electron beams can be generated by thermionic emission, field electron emission or the <b>anodic</b> arc method. The generated electron beam is accelerated to a high kinetic energy and directed towards the evaporation material. Upon striking the evaporation material, the electrons will lose their energy very rapidly. The kinetic energy of the electrons is converted into other forms of energy through interactions with the evaporation material. The thermal energy that is produced heats up the evaporation material causing it to melt or sublimate. Once temperature and vacuum level are sufficiently high, vapor will result from the melt or solid. The resulting vapor can then be used to coat surfaces. Accelerating voltages can be between 3 and 40 kV. When the accelerating voltage is 20–25 kV and the beam current is a few amperes, 85% of the electron's kinetic energy can be converted into thermal energy. Some of the incident electron energy is lost through the production of X-rays and secondary electron emission.|$|E
2500|$|In certain {{situations}} where strong electroosomotic flow toward the cathode is undesirable, the inner {{surface of the}} capillary can be coated with polymers, surfactants, or small molecules to reduce electroosmosis to very low levels, restoring the normal direction of migration (anions toward the anode, cations toward the cathode). [...] CE instrumentation typically includes power supplies with reversible polarity, allowing the same instrument {{to be used in}} [...] "normal" [...] mode (with EOF and detection near the cathodic end of the capillary) and [...] "reverse" [...] mode (with EOF suppressed or reversed, and detection near the <b>anodic</b> end of the capillary). [...] One of the most common approaches to suppressing EOF, reported by Stellan Hjertén in 1985, is to create a covalently attached layer of linear polyacrylamide. [...] The silica surface of the capillary is first modified with a silane reagent bearing a polymerizable vinyl group (e.g. 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane), followed by introduction of acrylamide monomer and a free radical initiator. [...] The acrylamide is polymerized in situ, forming long linear chains, some of which are covalently attached to the wall-bound silane reagent. [...] Numerous other strategies for covalent modification of capillary surfaces exist. [...] Dynamic or adsorbed coatings (which can include polymers or small molecules) are also common. [...] For example, in capillary sequencing of DNA, the sieving polymer (typically polydimethylacrylamide) suppresses electroosmotic flow to very low levels. [...] A variety of dynamic capillary coating agents are commercially available to modify, suppress, or reverse the direction of electroosmotic flow. [...] Besides modulating electroosmotic flow, capillary wall coatings can also serve the purpose of reducing interactions between [...] "sticky" [...] analytes (such as proteins) and the capillary wall. [...] Such wall-analyte interactions, if severe, manifest as reduced peak efficiency, asymmetric (tailing) peaks, or even complete loss of analyte to the capillary wall.|$|E
