5000|$|Lop ear — A {{protruding}} ear {{characterized by}} the defects of a too-small helix (the cartilage-stiffened rim of the pinna) and a large, central depression around the <b>auricular</b> <b>canal</b> (ear opening); the combined effects of the deformations produce a “cup ear” appearance. The usual plastic correction is enlargement of the helix and closer anchoring to the head.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo report authors’ {{experiences}} in the diagnosis and treatments of congenital first branchial fistula (congenital auriculocervical fistula). Materials and MethodsTwelve cases of congenital first branchial fistula were reviewed. Of these, 8 underwent fistulectomy with facial nerve dissection and partial parotidectomy and 4 underwent simple fistulectomy. ResultsThe inner openings (upper opening) of fistulae lay in the following sites: inferioposterior wall at the junction of cartilaginous and bony segments of the <b>auricular</b> <b>canal</b> and inferior wall of cartilaginous <b>auricular</b> <b>canal.</b> The outer openings(lower opening) lay along the anterior border of upper sternocleidomastoid muscle, at the mastoid tip and posterior to the mandibular angle. Complete fistulae resection was achieved {{in all but one}} case. Eleven cases were followed for 5 year with no recurrence. Recurrence occurred in 1 case 6 months after the primary surgery and revision surgery was performed. ConclusionsPre–operative radiography for the location and course of the fistula is crucial for successful fistula resection, especially in cases with past infections. Facial nerve dissection should be done routinely for deeply located fistulae...|$|E
40|$|Leukemic {{involvement}} {{of the temporal bone}} is not uncommon and may present {{in a variety of ways}} including <b>auricular</b> or external <b>canal</b> skin lesions, red or thick tympanic membrane, middle ear effusions, otitis media, hearing loss or mastoiditis. Symptomatic facial nerve involvement, on the other hand, is extremely unusual. We discuss a pediatric patient whose sudden onset facial nerve paresis was the presenting symptom that led to her diagnosis of leukemia. At the time of mastoidectomy, a granulocytic sarcoma or chloroma was noted to be overlying the VIIth nerve...|$|R
40|$|Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome (RHS) is a {{rare disease}} {{characterized}} by peripheral facial paralysis, cochleovestibular symptoms, skin lesions in the <b>auricular</b> <b>canal</b> and/or in the auricula and rarely skin lesions in the hard palate. The disease {{is also known as}} Herpes zoster oticus or herpes zoster cephalicus. Early diagnosis and antiviral treatment of peripheral nerve paralysis associated with higher rates of improvement. RHS, which {{is a rare}} disease in children should be considered in the differential diagnosis in children presenting with peripheral nerve palsy, erythema, vesicular lesions and/or ear pain. Here we presented a child case in which the first symptom was ear pain and facial palsy, followed by vesicular lesions in the ear pinna, and in the external auditory meatus. The patient recovered without squela of oral steroids and antiviral therapy. ...|$|E
40|$|Three {{experiments}} were designed {{in order to}} study the excretion routes of mycoplasmas involved in caprine contagious agalactia in chronically infected goat populations. The results obtained for external <b>auricular</b> <b>canal</b> (EAC) swabs were compared to other samples: 1) nasal swabs in 95 bucks; 2) conjunctival swabs in 85 bucks; 3) milk and vaginal swabs in 23 goats. Serology to detect specific antibodies against Mycoplasma agalactiae (Ma) was also conducted. Out of 1061 samples, the presence of Ma, Mmc and Mcc was detected in 23, 18 and 8 samples, respectively, which belonged to 24 bucks and 7 goats. EAC analyses detected 21 bucks (87. 5 %) and 4 infected goats (57. 1 %). Additional sampling (conjunctival, nasal swabs and vaginal swabs in goats) allowed the detection of further infected animals, {{in comparison to the}} sole sampling of the EAC...|$|E
40|$|The yeasts of the Malassezia genus are {{opportunistic}} microorganisms and {{can cause}} human and animal infections. They are commonly isolated from the skin and <b>auricular</b> <b>canal</b> of mammalians, mainly dogs and cats. The present study was aimed to isolate Malassezia spp. from the acoustic meatus of bats (Molossus molossus) in the Montenegro region, `` Rondonia ``, Brazil. From a total of 30 bats studied Malassezia spp. were isolated in 24 (80 %) animals, the breakdown by species being as follows (one Malassezia sp. per bat, N= 24) : 15 (62. 5 %) M. pachydermatis, 5 (20. 8 %) M. furfur, 3 (12. 5 %) M. globosa and 1 (4. 2 %) M. sympodialis. This study establishes a new host and anatomic place for Malassezia spp., as it presents the first report ever of the isolation of this genus of yeasts in the acoustic meatus of bats...|$|E
40|$|However, I {{found in}} this paper what I {{consider}} to be a misunderstanding of the difference be-tween the anatomic term "conus " and the embryo-logic term "conus. " The anatomic term conus col-loquially is used synonymously with the term "outflow tract " of the right ventricle and infundib-ulum. The embryologic term conus is used synony-mously with the term bulbus. If we follow the concepts of Pernkopf, Wirting-er, and Asami as {{to the development of the}} heart, then the definitive right and left ventricles both have components of proampulla, metaampulla, and bulbus (conus-embryologic) in their composi-tion. However, the left ventricle is mostly pro-ampulla with lesser metaampulla and bulbus, but the right ventricle contains more metaampulla and bulbus (conus-embryologic). This is because in the movements of the <b>auricular</b> <b>canal</b> to the right, and in the absorption of the bulbus during the second phase of development, there is expansion of the tricuspid orifice and dorsal wall of the metaampulla, shrinkage of the right side of the proampulla, and shrinkage of the mesocardial wall of the proximal bulbus, as it lies in the groove be-tween the mitral and tricuspid orifices. Thus, the inflow tract of the right ventricle contains both proampulla and metaampulla, while the outflow tract contains both metaampulla and bulbus (co-nus-embryologic). The outflow tract of the right ventricle is only partially bulbus (conus-embryo-logic). The outflow tract of the right ventricle anatomi-cally is lined by the septal and parietal band groups of muscles. According to Pernkopf and Wirtinger and many others these groups of mus-cles are bulbar and metaampullar in origin. Thus, the embryologic term conus and the ana-tomic term conus are not the same since the ana-tomic term conus includes in it embryologically both bulbus (conus-embryologic) and meta-ampulla. One can get around this semantic con-fusion by calling the outflow tract of the right ventricle infundibulum, and not conus...|$|E
