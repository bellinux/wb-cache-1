25|$|There is no {{consensus}} on {{the speed of a}} learning curve. Tim Travers wrote that there was no one 'villain' but the pre-war regular army. Travers blamed the management of early campaigns on the ethos of the pre-war officer corps, which was based on privilege, with a hierarchy intent on self-preservation and maintaining individual reputations. As a consequence the army was poorly positioned to adapt quickly. Travers wrote that initiative was discouraged, making advancement in a learning curve slow and that the ethos of the army was pro-human and anti-technological. The offensive spirit of the infantry, quality of the soldier, rapid rifle-fire and the idea of the soldier being {{the most important aspect of}} the battlefield prevailed. The lessons of the Russo-Japanese War and the power of artillery were ignored, which caused costly tactical mistakes in the first half of the war. The tactics that Haig pursued (a breakthrough battle deep into enemy territory) were beyond the mobility and range of artillery, which contributed to operational failures and heavy losses. Travers also criticised Haig and enemy commanders for (in Travers' opinion) seeing battle as perfectly organised <b>and</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> could be planned perfectly, ignoring the concept of fog of war and confusion in battle. Travers wrote that top-down command became impossible in the chaos of battle and lower levels of command were relied upon. Owing to the lack of attention at this level in the early years of the war, a command vacuum was created in which GHQ became a spectator.|$|E

Miller later explained that he wanted the production to avoid the mistakes typically made in movie tie-in games involved a lack of time devoted to the production, and excluding the people working on the film from work on the game. Miller hoped that they had rectified these issues with Star Trek, and explained that they hadn't produced a similar game to tie-in with 2009's Star Trek film {{because it would have}} suffered from those problems.

Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine claims that the game's Junction system is a major flaw due to repetitive stocking of spells, while the video game magazine Edge commented that the battle system consists of a [...] "bewildering" [...] number of intricate options and techniques that [...] "most gamers will [...] relish".GameSpot praised the game's battle system, commenting that the [...] "possibilities for customization [...] are immense".|$|E

Writing for IGN, Buchanan described an outside perspective on Sega's decision to release the Sega CD with its poor library and console support, stating, [...] "he SEGA CD instead looked like a strange, desperate move—something designed to nab some ink but without any real, thought-out strategy. Genesis owners that invested in the add-on were sorely disappointed, which undoubtedly helped sour the non-diehards on the brand." [...] In reviewing for GamePro, Snow commented that [...] " [...] Sega CD marked {{the first of several}} Sega systems that saw very poor support; something that devalued the once-popular Sega brand in the eyes of consumers, <b>and</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> would ultimately lead to the company's demise as a hardware maker." ...|$|E

It was basically a toy show." [...] Peters saw a cover of National Geographic, containing a picture of a skull, going to art department workers, telling them he wanted the design for Brainiac's space ship to have the same image. Burton gave Despretz a concept drawing for Brainiac, which Despretz claims was [...] "a cone with a round ball on top, <b>and</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> looked like an emaciated skull inside.

Nimoy however later agreed to a reappearance in the two-part season finale [...] "Over There". The visual effect of making Walter and Bell appear younger was produced by Zoic Studios. Fringes visual effects supervisor, Jay Worth, explained [...] "The guys at Zoic had to walk {{a fine line between}} too plasticky, stretched, morph effects <b>and</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> naturalistically looks younger". During filming for [...] "Brown Betty", Noble described the episode in an interview, [...] "'Grey Matters' was a very important episode for Walter because it helped to explain to some degree his apparent behavior.

500|$|Before {{the release}} and {{promotion}} of Celebrity Skin, Love and Fender designed a low-priced Squier brand guitar, called Vista Venus. The instrument featured a shape inspired by Mercury, a little-known independent guitar manufacturer, Stratocaster, and Rickenbacker's solid body guitars and had a single-coil and a humbucker pickup, and was available in 6-string and 12-string versions. In an early 1999 interview, Love said about the Venus: [...] "I wanted a guitar that sounded really warm and pop, but which required just one box to go dirty... <b>And</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> could also be your first band guitar. I didn't want it all teched out. I wanted it real simple, with just one pickup switch." [...] In 1999, Love was awarded an Orville H. Gibson award for Best Female Rock Guitarist. During this time, she also starred opposite Jim Carrey as his longtime partner Lynne Margulies in the Andy Kaufman biopic Man on the Moon (1999), which was followed with a role as William S. Burroughs's wife Joan Vollmer in Beat (2000) alongside Kiefer Sutherland.|$|E

Time Out Rio de Janeiro stated that [...] "It was roundly rejected by traditional critics and short-sighted viewers." [...] Opinions were revised after its restoration in 1952 for a screening at the 1st Brazilian Cinema Retrospective, when it [...] "deeply impressed" [...] the directors who {{would be part of}} Cinema Novo movement in the 1960s and 1970s. For example, Glauber Rocha was especially impressed and later cited it as [...] "one of the 20 best films of all time" [...] in his book Revisão Crítica do Cinema Brasileiro. Another film director, Walter Lima, Jr., declared, [...] "there are two films that are such clear archetypes of Brazil's eternal quest, namely Limite and Ganga Bruta.
