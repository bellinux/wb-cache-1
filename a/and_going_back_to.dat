[...] Nolan mentioned {{a recurring theme}} throughout the album: [...] "The issue of being an adult with a real life and a long-term relationship or marriage, {{and trying to make}} that work." [...] The album's sound has been described as rock. Band members made up their own sequences for the track listing, then noted the similarities. Lazzara said [...] "...with El Paso ... Why not come out swinging?" [...] The track {{was one of the first}} songs written for the album, and Lazzara said it encapsulates [...] "both the mood of the environment we were in down there and the mood we were in about being back together again and writing new music". Lazzara called it [...] "probably the heaviest rock song we've ever written". After the group finished the track, they listened to it 15 or 16 times in a row, and proceeded to exclaim: [...] "Holy shit." [...] "When everybody's like 'Holy shit' about something, you're onto something. It's a total motorcycle-raging-down-the-highway kind of song." [...] Lazzara said [...] "Faith (When I Let You Down)" [...] matches a [...] "huge, punishing" [...] chorus with a soft verse, which comes across as a [...] "roller coaster" [...] to him. Lazzara mentioned that the track took longer to work on compared to the other songs on the album, going through 4 or 5 sets of lyrics.|$|E

500|$|Since the 1980s it {{has become}} common to speak of Post-Boom writers, {{most of whom were}} born during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, such as Roberto Bolaño, the post Boom Spanish {{language}} writer who has made the greatest impact on world literature. It is difficult to clearly situate the Post-Boom as many of its writers were active {{before the end of the}} Boom. [...] Indeed, some writers, like Jose Donoso could be said to belong to both movements. [...] His novel The Obscene Bird of Night (El obsceno pájaro de la noche, 1970) is considered, as Philip Swanson notes, [...] "one of the classics of the Boom." [...] His later work, however, fits more comfortably into the post-Boom. [...] Manuel Puig and Severo Sarduy are considered writers whose works embody the transition from the Boom to the Post-Boom. It is important to note that this uneasiness in categorization is perpetuated by the fact that major writers of the Boom (Fuentes, García Márquez and Vargas Llosa) continued writing well after the end of the Boom. [...] The post-Boom is distinct from the Boom in various respects, most notably in the presence of female authors such as Isabel Allende, Luisa Valenzuela, Giannina Braschi, Cristina Peri Rossi, and Elena Poniatowska. [...] While Valenzuela and Poniatowska were both active writers during, and in Poniatowska's case even before, the Boom period, Allende is considered [...] "a product of the Boom." [...] Shaw also identifies Antonio Skármeta, Rosario Ferre and Gustavo Sainz as Post-Boom writers. [...] The Post-Boom writers challenge the perceived elitism of the Boom by using a simpler, more readable style <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> realism.|$|E

He explained: [...] "I was opening for Soundgarden and getting shit thrown at me every night onstage. I did my own tour and was playing to roughly fifty people a night."

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with 'MaximoTV' on April 12, 2010, Ciara announced that the album would be titled, Basic Instinct. The title {{was inspired by the}} 1992 film of the same name, which starred Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas. Stone's character, Catherine Tramell, was a beautiful, seductive, and stealthy crime writer. Ciara told the interviewer [...] "When you get the record, you're gonna get a really fun vibe. You're gonna get an even more sensual side and also confident and cocky. I got like such an attitude on this record, but in such a fun way." [...] One song which follows this theme is [...] "I Run It," [...] Rap-Up described it as a sensual slow jam. The new album is said to sound much like Ciara's debut album, Goodies, and her 2006 single, [...] "Promise," [...] following on from comments made by Tricky Stewart that Ciara was going back to her roots with this album. Meanwhile, she told Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul magazine, that [...] "Basic Instinct is really about her trusting her instinct <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the R/urban basics in her music – like where she first started, in the days of [...] "Goodies" [...] and [...] "1, 2 Step." [...] In a later interview with Maxim, she said [...] "The album is about our basic wants and desires. But I have to say, Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct was smart, a little shady, and she definitely had a sexy gangsta thing going on." ...|$|E
