500|$|Wizards & Warriors has {{received}} scant coverage from modern video gaming websites. Video gaming website GamesRadar named the opening {{theme for the}} game as [...] "Game music of the day", noting that the theme [...] "suggests, from the moment {{you turn on the}} game, that knights, wizards, goblins <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> else are about to collide in a battle so epic it's destined for a Frazetta painting." [...] JC Fletcher from Joystiq called the game [...] "a simple action-platformer about a guy in thick armor who kicks open treasure chests in order to bribe knights". He also notes the variety of good and bad items such as the [...] "Staff of Power" [...] which inflicts much damage to enemies and conversely the [...] "Cloak of Darkness", which he says [...] "makes Kuros invisible to you but not to enemies". He said that the game has an arcade feel, with unlimited continues, a high-score list, name entry for high scores, and good music. Houston Press Jef Rouner lauded the game's music and animation, and noted its high difficulty level, especially during boss battles. IGN listed Wizards & Warriors at #56 on its [...] "Top 100 NES Games" [...] list, reviewer Sam Claiborn said that the game was inspired by Dungeons & Dragons-type RPGs, but it went further in incorporating action platforming elements along with more traditional RPG elements. Columnist and comedy writer Seanbaby humorously criticized the game for items that did not work as intended, including the [...] "Cloak of Darkness" [...] and the [...] "Boots of Lava Walk".|$|E

2500|$|On a little-endian system, the bytes {{are written}} {{from left to}} right in {{increasing}} significance, starting with the one's byte: 0Dh at +0, 0Ch at +1, 0Bh at +2, 0Ah at +3. Writing a 32-bit binary value to a memory location on a little-endian system and outputting the memory location (with growing addresses {{from left to right}}) shows that the order is reversed (byte-swapped) compared to usual big-endian notation. This is the way a hexdump is displayed: because the dumping program is unable to know what kind of data it is dumping, the only orientation it can observe is monotonically increasing addresses. The human reader, however, who knows {{that he or she is}} reading a hexdump of a little-endian system <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> kind of data he or she is reading, reads the byte sequence 0Dh,0Ch,0Bh,0Ah as the 32-bit binary value 168496141, or 0x0a0b0c0d in hexadecimal notation. (Of course, this is not the same as the number 0D0C0B0Ah = 0x0d0c0b0a = 218893066.) ...|$|E

She said: “I got to know a young boy who was more adult than his years <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> he wanted: to be a {{professional}} bike rider. I fell for him. Not because I thought he could become a great rider but because I felt straight away that I could play a role in his life, that he needed me. Three years later we were married. Our dream had started. We didn’t know then that it would turn into a nightmare.” ...|$|R

2500|$|Laird {{recalled}} that {{the publication of}} the first issue of his and Eastman's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic came about thanks to a loan the two secured from Quentin Eastman, Kevin's uncle. Although the two were able to pay him back swiftly, it led Laird to speculate about what could have been: [...] "if we hadn't gotten that loan from him at that point in our lives, it might have taken us a couple more months to raise that money from other sources, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> might have happened differently {{as a result of that}} delay?" [...] It occurred to him that [...] "there must be so many times where a self-publishing venture can sink or float on the strength of" [...] a relatively small amount of money, so he felt a desire to use some of his [...] "good fortune, in the financial sense, to help people out" [...] (and, in addition to the creators, the Foundation also aids those [...] "involved in charitable organizations").|$|E

5000|$|Suivisme: Some {{political}} analysts find {{the source of}} opportunism in a specific political methodology that is applied to maintain or increase political influence. An example might be so-called suivisme (a French word for political [...] "tail-ending" [...] or [...] "tailism") where people try to follow and infiltrate any movement that shows signs of being popular or capturing significant support, {{for the purpose of}} gaining influence. Another version of this is sampling public opinions with surveys and focus groups to discover what they think, to contrive policies that are popular. This is usually not regarded as genuine leadership by politicians <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they are doing, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> their constituency wants from personal experience. The opportunist tail-enders don't have any ideas themselves that lead to success, so they parasitize or plagiarize what others are doing in a bid to get a success.|$|R

'I don't know,' {{says the}} eldest sister, 'what {{to say to}} it; they have made such a rout about her being so handsome, and so charming, and I know not what, and that in her hearing too, that has turned the creature's head, I believe, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> {{possessions}} may follow such doings?

60|$|No doubt Lady Maria {{was very}} kind to Harry when they were alone. Before her sister, aunt, stepmother, she made light of him, calling him a simpleton, a chit, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> trivial names? Behind his back, and even before his face, she mimicked his accent, which smacked {{somewhat}} of his province. Harry blushed and corrected the faulty intonation, under his English monitresses. His aunt pronounced that they would soon make him a pretty fellow.|$|E
5000|$|Perrion espouses {{that women}} may respond favorably to men <b>who</b> are {{confident}} <b>and</b> fun, but not arrogant.

As he puts it, [...] "men who like women are liked by women".|$|R
60|$|The obstinate resistance, however, {{that had}} been given by the Russians to the attacks on their rear-guard had {{impressed}} the invaders with a respect for their foes, that was in strong contrast to the feeling entertained when they crossed the frontier, save only among the soldiers who had met the Russians before, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> with <b>what</b> dogged valour they always fought, especially when on the defensive.|$|R
