25|$|Hexadecimal numerals {{are widely}} used by {{computer}} system designers and programmers. As each hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits (bits), it allows a more human-friendly representation of binary-coded values. One hexadecimal digit represents <b>a</b> <b>nibble</b> (4 bits), which is half of an octet or byte (8 bits). For example, a single byte can have values ranging from 00000000 to 11111111 in binary form, but this may be more conveniently represented as 00 to FF in hexadecimal.|$|E
25|$|One {{limitation}} of flash memory is that, {{although it can}} be read or programmed a byte or a word {{at a time in}} a random access fashion, it can be erased only a block at a time. This generally sets all bits in the block to 1. Starting with a freshly erased block, any location within that block can be programmed. However, once a bit has been set to 0, only by erasing the entire block can it be changed back to 1. In other words, flash memory (specifically NORflash) offers random-access read and programming operations, but does not offer arbitrary random-access rewrite or erase operations. A location can, however, be rewritten as long as the new value's 0 bits are a superset of the over-written values. For example, <b>a</b> <b>nibble</b> value may be erased to 1111, then written as 1110. Successive writes to that nibble can change it to 1010, then 0010, and finally 0000. Essentially, erasure sets all bits to 1, and programming can only clear bits to 0. File systems designed for flash devices can make use of this capability, for example, to represent sector metadata.|$|E
500|$|Once there, he sits {{cross-legged on}} his lily-pad and {{arranges}} his tackle. He has [...] "the dearest little red float". His rod is a stalk {{of grass and}} his line a horsehair. An hour passes without <b>a</b> <b>nibble.</b> He takes a break and lunches on a butterfly sandwich. A water beetle tweaks his toe causing him to withdraw his legs, and rats rustling about in the rushes force him to seek a safer location. He drops his line {{into the water and}} immediately has a bite. It is not a minnow but little Jack Sharp, a stickleback. The fish escapes but not before Jeremy pricks his fingers on Jack's spines. A shoal of little fishes come to the surface to laugh at Jeremy.|$|E

There's not one in a hundred as lucky as you. Here's Adam with three pound ten a week, foreman already at the Chalk Works, and likely enough to be manager if he's spared. And there's Elias, head {{telegraph}} clerk at the Post Office, and earning good money too. You can't keep 'em both on. You've got to take one or t'other, and it's my belief you'll get neither if you don't stop this shilly-shally." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>nibbler,</b> or nibblers, is a {{tool for}} cutting sheet metal with minimal distortion. One type {{operates}} much like a punch and die, with a blade that moves in a linear fashion against a fixed die, removing small bits of metal and leaving a kerf approximately 6 mm wide. Another type operates similar to tin snips, but shears the sheet along two parallel tracks 3-6 mm apart, rolling up the waste in a tight spiral as it cuts. Nibblers may be manual (hand operated) or powered.|$|R
50|$|Part of the Fast Hack'em {{disk copy}} {{software}} was <b>a</b> <b>nibbler</b> {{used to produce}} copies of copy protected Commodore 64 commercial software. When using the nibbler, disk copying was done on a very low level, bit-by-bit rather than using standard Commodore DOS commands. This effectively nullified the efficacy of deliberate disk errors, non-standard track layouts, and related forms of copy prevention. Copying a protected disk took approximately 60 seconds if being copied directly to another disk drive, or 3 minutes (plus several disk swaps) if performed using a single disk drive.|$|R

During {{the period between}} Gregor and the Prophecy of Bane and Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods, she and her bond Aurora were trapped in the Jungle and became close friends with the nibbler colony there. It is that colony's request for help that {{motivated}} her, Aurora, Gregor, and Ares to begin their quest. She later makes the [...] "Vow to the Dead" [...] {{at the site of}} <b>a</b> <b>nibbler</b> mass execution, essentially pledging all her personal and political power to avenge the mice's deaths.|$|R
60|$|Two hours did the grapnels descend {{before they}} reached {{the bottom of the}} sea!

60|$|Jeff Peters must be reminded. Whenever he {{is called}} upon, pointedly, for a story, he will {{maintain}} {{that his life}} has been as devoid of incident as the longest of Trollope's novels.

50|$|In the 2000s, McVey {{learns that}} an Italian native named Enrico Zanetti {{claims to have}} beaten his score in September 1984, shortly after reading about McVey in the Italian video game magazine, Video Giochi. News footage from an Italian TV station {{demonstrates}} Zanetti breaking the score and the subsequent celebrity he received. While McVey acknowledges that Zanetti may have legitimately beaten him, Day claims that, because no one from Twin Galaxies witnessed the event, Zanetti's score is invalid. Zanetti himself is unfazed, content just {{to know that he}} achieved the score. Nonetheless, McVey decides to beat Zanetti's score and purchases <b>a</b> <b>Nibbler</b> machine of his own.|$|R
60|$|With that, {{and with}} an {{expression}} of face in which a great number of opposite ingredients, such as mischief, cunning, malice, triumph, and patient expectation, were all mixed up together in a kind of physiognomical punch, Miss Miggs composed herself to wait and listen, like some fair ogress who had set a trap and was watching for <b>a</b> <b>nibble</b> from a plump young traveller.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it's {{nice for}} a time, but you soon grow tired of it, I imagine," [...] she hastened to reassure him. [...] "The world is good, but {{life should be}} many-sided.

60|$|So Peter hurried over to {{the nearest}} tree. All around {{the trunk of the}} tree, from the ground clear up higher than Peter could reach, was wrapped wire netting. Peter couldn't get so much as <b>a</b> <b>nibble</b> of the delicious bark. He hadn't {{intended}} to take any, for he had meant to go right straight home, but now that he couldn't get any, he wanted some more than ever,--just a bite. Peter looked around. Everything was quiet. He would try the next tree, and then he would go home.|$|E

60|$|Fully {{five minutes}} passed and Giant felt <b>a</b> small <b>nibble.</b> He pulled the bait {{around a bit}} and then felt a sudden tug. Up came his line with a rush, and out on the ice flopped a {{pickerel}} of fair size.|$|R
60|$|Peter {{got there}} in safety {{and his eyes}} sparkled as he hopped over to the nearest young tree. But when he reached it, Peter had a dreadful disappointment. All around the trunk of that young tree was wire netting. Peter couldn't get even <b>a</b> <b>nibble</b> of that bark. He tried the next tree with no better result. Then he hurried on from tree to tree, always with the same result. You see Farmer Brown knew all about Peter's liking for the bark of young fruit trees, {{and he had been}} wise enough to protect his young orchard.|$|E
60|$|There {{the same}} thing happened. He was very patient, very, very patient, but his {{patience}} brought no reward, {{not so much as}} the faintest kind of <b>a</b> <b>nibble.</b> Farmer Brown's boy trudged on to the next pool, and there was a puzzled frown on his freckled face. Such a thing never had happened before. He didn't {{know what to make of}} it. All the night before he had dreamed about the delicious dinner of fried trout he would have the next day, and now--well, if he didn't catch some trout pretty soon, that splendid dinner would never be anything but a dream.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just the same, {{to dig a}} dainty out of {{your pocket}} {{once in a while}} and give an animal <b>a</b> <b>nibble,</b> always makes a hit with the audience. That's about all it's good for, yet it's a good stunt. Audiences like to believe that the animals enjoy doing their tricks, and that they are treated like pampered darlings, and that they just love their masters to death. But God help all of us and our meal tickets if the audiences could see behind the scenes. Every trained-animal turn would be taken off the stage instanter, and we'd be all hunting for a job." ...|$|E
