The clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth has led to <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting {{in the loss of}} habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{previously}} described study by Veereman-Wauters et al.

5|$|Adolf Hitler's rise {{to power}} in Germany and his regime's anti-Semitic {{policies}} significantly affected American pre-Code filmmaking. Although Hitler had become unpopular {{in many parts of}} the United States, Germany was still a voluminous importer of American films and the studios wanted to appease the German government. The ban on Jews and negative portrayals of Germany in the Fatherland even led to <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> work for Jews in Hollywood until after the end of World War II. As a result, only two social problem films released by independent film companies addressed the mania in Germany during the pre-Code era (Are We Civilized? and Hitler's Reign of Terror).|$|E

5|$|In 2010, the Obama {{administration}} {{passed the}} Affordable Care Act, {{which made the}} most sweeping reforms to the nation's healthcare system in nearly five decades, including mandates, subsidies and insurance exchanges. The law caused <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> the number and percentage of people without health insurance, with 24 million covered during 2016, but remains controversial due to its impact on healthcare costs, insurance premiums, and economic performance. Although the recession reached its trough in June 2009, voters remained frustrated with {{the slow pace of}} the economic recovery. The Republicans, who stood in opposition to Obama's policies, won control of the House of Representatives with a landslide in 2010 and control of the Senate in 2014.|$|E

5|$|Over {{a period}} of six months, a total of 24 test flights were conducted. Most of the complex {{electronics}} were not fitted to the first aircraft, so these flights were all concerned with the basic flying qualities of the aircraft which, according to the test pilots involved, were outstanding. Speeds of Mach 1.12 and sustained low-level flights down to 200ft (above the Pennines) were achieved. Undercarriage vibration problems continued, however, and only in the final few flights, when XR219 was fitted with additional tie-struts on the already complex landing gear, was there <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> them. The last test flight took place on 31 March 1965.|$|E
5|$|Pei and {{his team}} also {{designed}} a united urban area for Washington, D.C., L'Enfant Plaza (named for French-American architect Pierre Charles L'Enfant). Pei's associate Araldo Cossutta was the lead architect for the plaza's North Building (955 L'Enfant Plaza SW) and South Building (490 L'Enfant Plaza SW). Vlastimil Koubek was the architect for the East Building (L'Enfant Plaza Hotel, located at 480 L'Enfant Plaza SW), and for the Center Building (475 L'Enfant Plaza SW; now the United States Postal Service headquarters). The team set out with a broad vision that was praised by both the Washington Post and Washington Star (which rarely agreed on anything), but funding problems forced revisions and <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> scale.|$|E
5|$|In 1877, List's father died. List soon {{abandoned}} the leather goods business that he inherited, intent on devoting himself to literary endeavours as a journalist, {{even if this}} meant <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> his income. On 26 September 1878 he married his first wife, Helene Förster-Peters. From 1877 to 1887 he wrote for the nationalist magazines Neue Welt ("New World"), Heimat ("Homeland"), Deutsche Zeitung ("German Newspaper"), and the Neue Deutsche Alpenzeitung ("New German Alpine Newspaper"), with his articles being devoted to the Austrian countryside and the folk customs of its inhabitants. His interpretations emphasised what he believed were the pagan origins of Austrian place-names, customs, and legends, describing the landscape as being embodied by genius loci, and expressing clear German nationalist and völkisch sentiment.|$|E

50|$|In 2007, Menerba {{completed}} a multi-center Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial evaluating {{its potential for}} the treatment of hot flashes in 217 healthy post-menopausal women in the U.S. The principal investigator of the trial was Dr. Deborah Grady from the University of California, San Francisco. Menerba showed <b>a</b> statistically <b>significant</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> the number of hot flashes after 12 weeks of treatment and had <b>a</b> statistically <b>significant</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> nighttime awakenings from hot flashes (-67%, p=0.05).

The only side effect observed was mild loose stools (12% in treatment group vs. 3% in the placebo group).|$|R
5|$|The {{previously}} described study by Timby et al. (2015) also assessed {{the effects of}} MFGM supplementation in term infants on the risk of infectious diseases and other disease symptoms. In particular, the cumulative incidence of acute otitis media was analyzed between the two randomized feeding groups (control formula or MFGM- supplemented formula to 6 months of age), and compared to a breastfed reference group. The MFGM-supplemented group experienced <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> episodes of acute otitis media up to 6 months of age compared with infants fed control formula (1% vs 9%; P=0.034); with {{no significant difference in}} otitis media incidence compared to the breastfed group (0%). In addition, a significantly lower incidence and longitudinal prevalence of antipyretic drug use was seen in the MFGM-supplemented group (25%) compared with the control formula group (43%). Timby et al. (2017) further showed that the MFGM supplementation influenced the infants’ oral microbiota; the authors noted that, Moraxella catarrhalis, a common bacterial cause of acute otitis media, was less prevalent in infants fed the MFGM-supplemented formula than in those fed control formula.|$|E
5|$|These initial concerns, however, {{were short}} lived, {{at least in}} the {{beginning}} as the British government provided assurances that it would underwrite a large amount of the war risk insurance for shipping in order to allow trade amongst the Commonwealth to continue. Shortly thereafter the wartime direction of trade began when the British asked the Australian government to place certain restrictions upon overseas trade in order to secure resources vital to the war effort and to limit the ability of the Central Powers from obtaining these goods from Commonwealth nations via neutral third parties. To an extent these restrictions served to reduce the ability of Australian producers to find buyers for their products, at least initially, however, in many cases the British stepped in to buy these goods, thus alleviating Australian concerns about <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> the standard of living. This understanding proved particularly beneficial for the wool and wheat industries, where the British government undertook to buy Australian products even though the shortage of shipping meant that there was no chance that they would ever receive them.|$|E
5|$|Guadeloupe {{was taken}} over as a British colony for the {{remainder}} of the war, only restored to France after Napoleon's abdication in 1814. The following year, during the Hundred Days, Guadeloupe's governor Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois declared for the Emperor once more, requiring another British invasion, although of much smaller size and duration, to restore the monarchy. The fall of Guadeloupe marked the end of the final French territory in the Caribbean; the entire region was now in the hands of either the British or the Spanish, except the independent state of Haiti. The lack of French privateers and warships sparked a boom in trade operations, and the economies of the Caribbean islands experienced a resurgence. It also made <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> French international trade and had a corresponding effect on the French economy. Finally, the capture of the last French colony struck a decisive blow to the Atlantic slave trade, which had been made illegal by the British government in 1807 and was actively persecuted by the Royal Navy. Without French colonies in the Caribbean, there was no ready market for slaves in the region and the slave trade consequently dried up.|$|E
