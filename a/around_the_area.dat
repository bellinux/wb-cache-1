5|$|By 1930, SH112 {{had been}} paved from Del Norte {{to the county}} line. Because the {{residents}} of San Luis Valley sought better roads, the Department of Highways began improving SH112 <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>area,</b> but the highway was not fully surfaced until 1946. The next year, Rio Grande and Saguache counties paid to resurface {{the rest of the}} road in asphalt. Since 1947, there have been no major realignments in the routing.|$|E
5|$|The O-Bahn {{has caused}} a {{clustering}} of commercial and community development near the Tea Tree Plaza Interchange, as service-providing organisations and businesses have sought to exploit the area's easy accessibility to public transport and the city centre. Market imperatives have also been aided by the zoning of the land <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> as commercial rather than residential. The area around Tea Tree Plaza {{is one of five}} designated regional centres within the Adelaide metropolis.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of a large, unusual creature in Muskrat Lake {{has been the subject}} of anecdotes since 1916. The creature's name was originally cited as Hapyxelor, alternately spelled Hapaxelor, but changed simply to Mussie, short for The Monster of Muskrat Lake, sometime later. Humphries, a man from Cobden, was a well-known proponent of Mussie's existence. <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> <b>area,</b> many people's knowledge of the creature come from his vehement, albeit inconsistent, tales of observing it once.|$|E
5|$|The station {{closed in}} 1940 (along with nearby Marlborough Street Magistrates Court) to be {{replaced}} with an integrated West End Central Police Station at Savile Row, with the street being renamed Piccadilly Place. A subsequent rise in foot traffic <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>area,</b> and associated crime, led to the station being re-opened in 1966, with the street being renamed back to Vine Street in 1972. The police station closed in 1997 and the building was demolished in 2005 for redevelopment.|$|E
5|$|Through Norman, Highway 9 {{serves as}} a major artery {{providing}} access to the University of Oklahoma campus (in particular, the Lloyd Noble Center). <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> <b>area,</b> the route is a four-lane divided expressway (with surface crossings and stoplights). However, after a full interchange with US-77, the road becomes a two lane highway again.|$|E

5|$|An {{abandoned}} sailboat drifts into New York Harbor and is boarded by harbor patrol officers. One {{is killed}} by a zombie, which falls overboard after being shot by another officer. The police question the boat owner's daughter, Anne Bowles (Tisa Farrow), who claims she hasn't seen her father for months. At the morgue, the officer's corpse stirs. Anne meets journalist Peter West (Ian McCulloch), and the pair follows her father's trail to the Caribbean island Matul. En route, they befriend Brian Hull (Al Cliver) and Susan Barrett (Auretta Gay), who are sailing <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> and agree {{to take them to}} Matul.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the male}} and female of the species reach sexual {{maturity}} after 1 year of life. The breeding season occurs in the spring and early summer. The males arrive before {{the beginning of the season}} to establish their territories. The males use a series of courtship displays to attract the females to their sites. They run <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> either to showcase their territory to the females or to pursue the females. The males also engage in flight to showcase their wings. They sing and call as they perform all of these displays. The species can remain monogamous for many years, but incidents of polygyny and bigamy have been reported to occur during the bird's lifetime.|$|E

50|$|The {{constituency}} {{is located}} {{in the southern part of}} South Dublin county. One of this name was first created in the 1940s and was used for elections from 1948 to 1973 inclusive. The original constituency was based <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> of Ballyfermot, Crumlin and Kilmainham. The constituency was then abolished and was mostly replaced by the Dublin Ballyfermot constituency. In its current incarnation the seat was created in 1981 and had completely different boundaries from the original pre-1977 constituency, being based <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> of Clondalkin, Newcastle, Rathcoole, Saggart, Tallaght, Templeogue, and parts of Terenure.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to {{problems with the}} terminal building, both the airport's location and surrounding infrastructure were {{the subject of much}} complaint as well. For one, although some 1,700 cars visited the airport daily, the parking lot had only 129 slots, and could not be expanded any further. The airport complex likewise was located directly alongside major city thoroughfares, in particular the city's main highway, the Tomas Confesor Highway, which complicated the flow of traffic in and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>area.</b> At one point, the ATO, which was already having difficulty managing vehicular traffic around the airport, proposed banning cargo and delivery trucks from passing through the road in front of the terminal building. However, the city government did not respond.|$|E
5|$|In {{the novels}} Halo: Fall of Reach and Halo: The Flood, it is {{told that the}} Grunts are methane {{breathers}} and described as dog-like. They have methane suits {{that allow them to}} remove the breathing apparatuses they usually wear to sustain them in a non-methane atmosphere. In Halo Reach, if a player kills a Grunt in a particular way, their methane tank will ignite causing them to fly and bounce <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> out of control, causing damage if they hit the player.|$|E
5|$|On October 1, 2010, MTA {{awarded a}} $431 million {{contract}} to SSK Constructors (a joint venture) for the mining of the tunnels connecting the 72nd Street station {{to the existing}} 63rd Street station, and for the excavation and heavy civil structures of the 72nd Street Station. Construction was to be done through two shafts at 69th and 72nd Streets, {{the locations of the}} future entrances; shaft sinking work was started in late 2010. Projected completion of the contract was estimated at November 2013. The rock <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> is mostly Manhattan schist, and was generally considered to be a stable location for blasting, so blasting for the station commenced on January 18, 2011.|$|E

5|$|The 256,300 man strong U.S. First Army, {{commanded}} by General Courtney Hodges, {{was ordered to}} break through the Siegfried Line <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> of Aachen, in order to reach the Rur river. Although the First Army began to encircle the area around Aachen in early September, the Battle of Aachen did not end until 21 October. The city cost the Americans roughly 3,000 casualties, but had opened the path to the Rur (river) river. Despite the casualties taken the ground gained was comparatively worthless, and the fighting for Aachen had not necessarily brought German defeat any closer.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{casualties}} at the landings {{were very}} light, with only 95killed and 385 wounded. 40 of those casualties {{were caused by}} a rocket-boosted Henschel Hs 293 guided gliding bomb launched from a Do-217 bomber aircraft by a rare appearance of the bomber wing KG 100, which sank the tank landing ship USS LST-282. In conjunction with the sea landing, airborne and glider landings (Mission Albatross followed by Mission Dove, Mission Bluebird, and Mission Canary) <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> of Le Muy were carried out. They were as successful as the beach landings, with only 104 dead, 24 of which were caused by glider accidents and 18 by parachute accidents.|$|E

The local and regional Philippine National Red Cross chapters reported major damage in at least 116 municipalities, 12 cities, {{and a total of}} 1,295 barangays across the country. Torrential rains from Milenyo also caused flooding and landslides in Laguna, Cavite, and Quezon.

Throughout the offensive, the Sri Lanka Air Force carried out numerous air strikes against Kilinochchi in support of the SLA.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season is August to January {{with one or}} two broods raised. The male proposes suitable nest sites to the female by hopping <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>area.</b> Unlike other robins, the female sometimes initiates the site selection. A pair spends anywhere from one to five days looking before finding a suitable site. The female constructs the nest alone. Eucalypts are generally chosen, but birds have been recorded nesting in Pinus radiata on Mount Wellington in Tasmania. The flame robin is more versatile in its selection of nesting sites than other robins, and has even been recorded nesting in sheds.|$|E
