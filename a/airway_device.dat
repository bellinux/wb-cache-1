Methods Four different supraglottic airway devices: Laryngeal Mask Classic (LMA), Laryngeal Tube (LT), Intubating Laryngeal Mask (FT) and CobraPLA (Cobra) were tested in 141 volunteers recruited in a technical university cafeteria and in a shopping mall. All volunteers received a brief standardized training session. Primary endpoint was the time required to definitive insertion. In a short questionnaire applicants were asked to assess the devices and to answer some general questions about BLS. Results The longest time to insertion was observed for Cobra (31. 9 ± 27. 9 s, range: 9 - 120, p 0. 05), the LT (1. 36 ± 0. 61, p Conclusion Laypersons are able to operate supraglottic <b>airway</b> <b>devices</b> in manikin with minimal instruction.

40|$|Airway {{management}} plays {{a pivotal}} role in Paediatric Anaesthesia. Over the last two decades many improvements in this area have helped us to overcome this final frontier. From an era where intubation with a conventional laryngoscope or blind nasal intubation was the only tool for airway management, we have come a long way. Today supraglottic <b>airway</b> <b>devices</b> have pride of place in the Operating Room and are becoming important <b>airway</b> <b>devices</b> used in routine procedures. Direct and indirect fibreoptic laryngoscopes and transtracheal devices help us overcome difficult and previously impossible airway situations. These developments mean that we need to update our knowledge on these devices. Also much of our basic understanding of the physiology and anatomy of the paediatric airway has changed. This article attempts to shed light on {{some of the most important}} advances/opinions in paediatric airway management like, cuffed endotracheal tubes, supraglottic <b>airway</b> <b>devices,</b> video laryngoscopes, rapid sequence intubation, the newly proposed algorithm for difficult airway management and the role of Ex Utero Intrapartum Treatment (EXIT) procedure in the management of the neonatal airway...|$|R

The European Resuscitation Council, in its 2005 guidelines for advanced life support (ALS), accepts its use as an alternate <b>airway</b> <b>device</b> for medical personnel who are not experienced in tracheal intubation.|$|E
50|$|Capnography is {{increasingly}} {{being used by}} EMS personnel to aid in their assessment and treatment of patients in the prehospital environment. These uses include verifying and monitoring the position of an endotracheal tube or a blind insertion <b>airway</b> <b>device.</b> A properly positioned tube in the trachea guards the patient's airway and enables the paramedic to breathe for the patient.

40|$|Introduction Airway {{management}} {{is an important}} component of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Recent guidelines recommend keeping any interruptions of chest compressions as short as possible and not lasting more than 10 seconds. Endotracheal intubation seems to be the ideal method for establishing a secure airway by experienced providers, but emergency medical technicians (EMT) often lack training and practice. For the EMTs supraglottic devices might serve as alternatives. Methods 40 EMTs were trained in a 1 -hour standardised audio-visual lesson to handle six different <b>airway</b> <b>devices</b> including endotracheal intubation, Combitube, EasyTube, I-Gel, Laryngeal Mask Airway and Laryngeal tube. EMTs performances were evaluated immediately after a brief practical demonstration, as well as after 1 and 3 months without any practice in between, in a randomised order. Hands-off time was pair-wise compared between <b>airway</b> <b>devices</b> using a repeated-measures mixed-effects model. Results Overall mean hands-off time was significantly (p< 0. 01) lower for Laryngeal tube (6. 1 s; confidence interval 5. 2 - 6. 9 s), Combitube (7. 9 s; 95 % CI 6. 9 - 9. 0 s), EasyTube (8. 8 s; CI 7. 3 - 10. 3 s), LMA (10. 2 s; CI 8. 6 - 11. 7 s), and I-Gel (11. 9 s; CI 10. 2 - 13. 7 s) compared to endotracheal intubation (39. 4 s; CI 34. 0 - 44. 9 s). Hands-off time was within the recommended limit of 10 s for Combitube, EasyTube and Laryngeal tube after 1 month and for all supraglottic devices after 3 months without any training, but far beyond recommended limits in all three evaluations for endotracheal intubation. Conclusion Using supraglottic <b>airway</b> <b>devices,</b> EMTs achieved a hands-off time within the recommended time limit of 10 s, even after three months without any training or practice. Supraglottic <b>airway</b> <b>devices</b> are recommended tools for EMTs with lack of experience in advanced airway management...|$|R

40|$|To ensure proper {{ventilation}} and {{the supply}} of inhalation anesthetics during general anesthesia, tracheal intubation is {{the most commonly used}} method in maintaining the airway. When it is difficult to perform a tracheal intubation, it is possible to maintain the airway by using a larygeal mask airway (LMA) or supraglottic <b>airway</b> <b>device</b> [1]. However, during a lengthy surgery or when a patient is in a non-supine position during surgery, one can expect that maintaining an LMA or supraglot-tic <b>airway</b> <b>device</b> will be difficult.

One hundred and five patients undergoing elective surgery were subjected to general anesthesia after which they were randomly distributed into three groups. Although the oropharyngeal leak pressure was lower in the i-gel group initially (mean ± standard deviation; 23. 9 ± 2. 4, 24. 9 ± 2. 9, and 20. 9 ± 3. 5, resp.), it was higher than the proseal group and supreme group at 30 [*]min of surgery after the trendelenburg position (25. 0 ± 2. 3, 25. 0 ± 1. 9, and 28. 3 ± 2. 3, resp.) and at the 60 [*]min of surgery (24. 2 ± 2. 1, 24. 8 ± 2. 2, and 29. 5 ± 1. 1, resp.). The time to apply the supraglottic <b>airway</b> <b>devices</b> was shorter in the i-gel group (12. 2 (1. 2), 12. 9 (1. 0), and 6. 7 (1. 2), resp., P= 0. 001).
