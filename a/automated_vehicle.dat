Yet, less {{is known about}} when <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> will hit the market, how penetration rates will evolve {{and to what extent}} this new transportation technology will affect transportation demand and planning. This study identified through scenario analysis plausible future development paths of <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the Netherlands and estimated potential implications for traffic, travel behavior and transport planning on a time horizon up to 2030 and 2050. The scenario analysis was performed through a series of three workshops engaging a group of diverse experts. Sixteen key factors and five driving forces behind them were identified as critical in determining future development of <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the Netherlands. Four scenarios were constructed assuming combinations of high or low technological development and restrictive or supportive policies for <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> (AV in standby, AV in bloom, AV in demand, AV in doubt). According to the scenarios, fully <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> are expected to be commercially available between 2025 and 2045, and to penetrate market rapidly after their 17 introduction. Penetration rates are expected to vary among different scenarios 1 between 1 % and 11 % (mainly conditionally <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles)</b> in 2030 and between 7 % and 61 % (mainly fully <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles)</b> in 2050.

40|$|The {{technology}} {{in the area of}} <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> is gaining speed and promises many advantages. However, with the recent introduction of conditionally automated driving, we have also seen accidents. Test protocols for both, conditionally automated (e. g., on highways) and <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> do not exist yet and leave researchers and practitioners with different challenges. For instance, current test procedures do not suffice for fully <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles,</b> which are supposed to be completely in charge for the driving task and have no driver as a back up. This paper presents current challenges of testing the functionality and safety of <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> derived from conducting focus groups and interviews with 26 participants from five countries having a background related to testing automotive safety-related topics.

40|$|<b>Automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{have reached}} the level of {{maturity}} in which their applicability to address transport needs are being assessed in pilot projects worldwide. It is of increasing importance to assess and share the experiences gained in these projects. This contribution reports about the application of <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{in the city of}} Appelscha, The Netherlands. Appelscha is part of the municipality of Ooststellingwerf and is challenged with a predicted decline of inhabitants and an already shrinking public transport network. To preserve the regions accessibility, the municipality of Ooststellingwerf started a pilot with electric <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The municipality of Ooststellingwerf rented two Easymile EZ 10 vehicles. These vehicles drove on a separate cycle lane for six weeks in September and October 2016. This pilot has shown that a pilot is possible with little infrastructural changes. Even though the maximum speed of 15 km/h might suggest that <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> are suitable to share the road with cyclists, the cycle lane in Appelscha was not sufficient due to the width of the cycle lane. Therefore cyclist had to pass the vehicles using the roadside. Extra safety measurements were taken to inform other road users and cyclists about the vehicle that they might cross paths with. Thanks to that no accidents occurred during the pilot. Apart from the non-suitable cycle lane, the idea of using the <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> was positively received by the public...|$|R

40|$|At {{automated}} container terminals, containers are transshipped {{from one}} {{mode of transportation}} to another. <b>Automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> transport containers from the stack to the ship and vice versa. Two different types of <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> are studied in this paper, namely <b>automated</b> lifting <b>vehicles</b> and <b>automated</b> guided <b>vehicles.</b> An <b>automated</b> lifting <b>vehicle</b> is capable of lifting a container from the ground by itself. An <b>automated</b> guided <b>vehicles</b> needs a crane to receive and deliver a container. In designing automated container terminals one {{have to consider the}} choice for a certain type of equipment. The choice for a certain type of equipment should be made by performing a feasibility and economic analysis on various types of equipment. In this paper, we examine effects of using <b>automated</b> guided <b>vehicles</b> and <b>automated</b> lifting <b>vehicles</b> on unloading times of a ship, with simulation studies. In choosing a certain type of equipment we have considered criteria such as unloading times of a ship, occupancy degrees and the number of vehicles required. 38 % more AGVs need to be used than ALVs. From this specific study, we conclude that, by observing only purchasing costs of equipment, ALVs are a cheaper option than AGVs. To obtain an accurate analysis we have performed a sensitivity analysis. It can be concluded that the design of the terminal and technical aspects of quay cranes impact the number of vehicles required and as a result the choice for a certain type of equipment. © Springer-Verlag 2004...|$|R

Where do <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> fall under current legal frameworks? What risks are associated with automation and how will society respond to these risks?

The authors further identify expectations and concerns that will form the basis for individual and societal acceptance of autonomous driving. While the safety benefits of such vehicles are tremendous, the authors demonstrate that these benefits will only be achieved if vehicles have an appropriate safety concept at the heart of their design. Realizing the potential of <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> to reorganize traffic and transform mobility of people and goods requires similar care in the design of vehicles and networks.

MobilEye sensors installed on buses in Ann Arbor, Michigan, collected data on 2, 973 valid crossing events.

40|$|In 2013 Willumsen, one of {{the most}} renowned {{researchers}} in transport modeling, stated, regarding automated vehicles: “We can no longer ignore them, if [the] planning horizon is 10 + years”. But works attempting to anticipate the effects of <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> on potential users’ everyday mobility, and specifically their choice of transport mode, are still rare. However, a glance at the individual driving forces of our daily mobility behavior does allow us to draw some cautious conclusions on potential behavioral changes arising from the introduction of <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Applying analogies to the use of known transport modes in transport demand modeling allows for initial quantitative statements about potential impacts on overall transport demand. In the process, demand modeling allows us to distinguish between different geographic contexts and user groups, and to evaluate various scenarios for the use of such systems. The aim of this chapter is to sketch out challenges and initial approaches on how to incorporate <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> among the choices of transport mode when modeling demand in passenger transport. First, we will examine which factors {{play a central role in}} the individual processes when weighing up the various transport modes. The following section gives a short introduction into transport demand modeling’s manner of operation. We shall then turn our attention to what behavioral changes may appear in transport modal choice as a result of introducing <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles.</b> We will discuss what properties of the new vehicles, and also of the geographic context and potential users themselves, could be significant in how the vehicles are perceived and received, and what competitive situation between transport modes this will result in. To support this work, we shall introduce the initial results of an online questionnaire on attitudes to <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> and their anticipated use. The concluding section addresses the following questions: What are the challenges when integrating <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> into model-supported transport demand analysis?
