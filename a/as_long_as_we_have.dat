500|$|Longstreet soon {{clashed with}} Bragg and became {{leader of the}} group of senior commanders of the army who conspired to have him removed. Bragg's {{subordinates}} had long been dissatisfied with his leadership and abrasive personality; the arrival of Longstreet (the senior lieutenant general in the Army) and his officers, added credibility to the earlier claims, and was a catalyst toward action. Longstreet wrote to Seddon, [...] "I am convinced that nothing but the hand of God can save us or help us <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> our present commander." [...] The situation became so grave that President Davis was forced to intercede in person. What followed {{was one of the most}} bizarre scenes of the war, with Bragg sitting red faced as a procession of his commanders condemned him. Longstreet stated that Bragg [...] "was incompetent to manage an army or put men into a fight" [...] and that he [...] "knew nothing of the business." [...] Davis sided with Bragg and did nothing to resolve the conflict.|$|E

2500|$|Some of Bragg's {{subordinate}} generals {{were frustrated}} {{at what they}} perceived to be his lack of willingness to exploit the victory by pursuing the Union army toward Chattanooga and destroying it. Polk in particular was outraged at being relieved of command. The dissidents, including many of the division and corps commanders, met in secret and prepared a petition to the president. Although {{the author of the}} petition is not known, historians suspect it was Simon Buckner, whose signature was first on the list. Lt. Gen. James Longstreet wrote to the Secretary of War with the prediction that [...] "nothing but the hand of God can save us or help us <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> our present commander." [...] With the Army of Tennessee literally on the verge of mutiny, Jefferson Davis reluctantly traveled to Chattanooga to personally assess the situation and to try to stem the tide of dissent in the army. Although Bragg offered to resign to resolve the crisis, Davis eventually decided to leave Bragg in command, denounced the other generals, and termed their complaints [...] "shafts of malice".|$|E

If we but consider that God the Son actually came down on earth to die, and to die too on the cross, for all mankind: then how dare we hate a human being for whom He died: at least if we have true honour, gratitude, loyalty, reverence, and godly fear in our hearts toward Him, our risen Lord? ...|$|E
60|$|If we {{inquire into}} the reason of what {{experience}} makes so evident in fact, and examine, {{why it is}} uneasiness alone operates on the will, and determines it in its choice, we shall find that, we being capable but of one determination of the will to one action at once, the present uneasiness that we are under does NATURALLY determine the will, in order to that happiness which we all aim at in all our actions. For, as much as whilst we are under any uneasiness, we cannot apprehend ourselves happy, or in the way to it; pain and uneasiness being, by every one, concluded and felt to be inconsistent with happiness, spoiling the relish even of those good things which we have: a little pain serving to mar all the pleasure we rejoiced in. And, therefore, that which of course determines the choice of our will to the next action will always be--the removing of pain, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> any left, as the first and necessary step towards happiness.|$|E

As {{soon as he saw}} her he told himself that she was not in the least altered since he had last been with her, and yet during the period she had undergone that great change which turns a girl into a mother.
