5|$|He {{was born}} on August 4, 1880 in Baltimore, Maryland and {{attended}} high school at Baltimore City College, from which he graduated in 1899. He received his undergraduate college education <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> <b>Hopkins</b> <b>University</b> and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1902. While at Hopkins, Schmeisser played as a defenseman on the lacrosse team from 1900 to 1902. He was {{also a member of}} the Beta Mu chapter of Phi Gamma Delta.|$|E
5|$|After the NSDAP came {{to power}} in Germany in 1933, Franck {{resigned}} his post in protest against the dismissal of fellow academics. He assisted Frederick Lindemann in helping dismissed Jewish scientists find work overseas, before he left Germany in November 1933. After a year at the Niels Bohr Institute in Denmark, he moved to the United States, where he worked <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> <b>Hopkins</b> <b>University</b> in Baltimore and then the University of Chicago. During this period he became interested in photosynthesis.|$|E

5|$|Born in Walkerton, Indiana, Urey studied {{thermodynamics}} under Gilbert N. Lewis at the University of California. After {{he received}} his PhD in 1923, he was awarded a fellowship by the American-Scandinavian Foundation to study at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen. He was a research associate <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> <b>Hopkins</b> <b>University</b> before becoming {{an associate professor of}} Chemistry at Columbia University. In 1931, he began work with the separation of isotopes that resulted in the discovery of deuterium.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Franck {{moved to}} the United States, where he had {{accepted}} a professorship <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> <b>Hopkins</b> <b>University.</b> The laboratory there was poorly equipped compared {{to the one in}} Göttingen, but he received $10,000 for equipment from the Rockefeller Foundation. A more intractable problem was that the university had no money to hire skilled staff. Franck was concerned about his family members remaining in Germany, and needed money to help them emigrate. He therefore accepted an offer from the University of Chicago, where his work on photosynthesis had attracted interest, in 1938.|$|E

5|$|Soon after {{arriving}} in China, MacMurray fell into disagreement with Washington over U.S. policy towards the ruling Kuomintang (Nationalist) government, which had been demanding immediate revisions to or a cessation of the treaty system in place between the two countries. Whereas Washington wished to make concessions to the Nationalist government, MacMurray favored the enforcement of existing treaties. These differences of opinion led him to resign in November 1929, whereupon he became a professor of International Relations <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> <b>Hopkins</b> <b>University.</b>|$|E
5|$|The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill made Wheeler an {{associate}} professor in 1937, but he wanted to be able work more closely with the experts in particle physics. He turned down an offer in 1938 of {{an associate}} professorship <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> <b>Hopkins</b> <b>University</b> in favor of an assistant professorship at Princeton University. Although it was a lesser position, he felt that Princeton, which was building up its physics department, was a better career choice. He remained a member of the faculty there until 1976.|$|E
5|$|The {{witnesses}} testifying {{on behalf}} of the state whose testimony attracted the most attention were Éric Fombonne, a psychiatrist at McGill University, Jeffrey Brent, a medical toxicologist at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, and Stephen Bustin of Queen Mary University of London.

5|$|Wheeler {{earned his}} {{doctorate}} <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> <b>Hopkins</b> <b>University</b> {{under the supervision}} of Karl Herzfeld, and studied under Breit and Bohr on a National Research Council fellowship. In 1939 he teamed up with Bohr to write a series of papers using the liquid drop model to explain the mechanism of fission. During World War II, he worked with the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago, where he helped design nuclear reactors, and then at the Hanford Site in Richland, Washington, where he helped DuPont build them. He returned to Princeton after the war ended, but returned to government service to help design and build the hydrogen bomb in the early 1950s.|$|E
5|$|On {{returning}} to the United States, Urey received an offer of a National Research Council fellowship to Harvard University, and also received an offer to be a research associate <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> <b>Hopkins</b> <b>University.</b> He chose the latter. Before taking up the job, he traveled to Seattle, Washington, to visit his mother. On the way, he stopped by Everett, Washington, where he knew a woman called Kate Daum. Kate introduced Urey to her sister, Frieda. Urey and Frieda soon became engaged. They were married at her father's house in Lawrence, Kansas, in 1926. The couple had four children: Gertrude Bessie (Elisabeth), born in 1927; Frieda Rebecca, born in 1929; Mary Alice, born in 1934; and John Clayton Urey, born in 1939.|$|E
5|$|In January 1933, the Nazi Party came {{to power}} in Germany. In May, Born became one of six Jewish professors at Göttingen who were {{suspended}} with pay; Franck had already resigned. In twelve years they had built Göttingen into one of the world's foremost centres for physics. Born began looking for a new job, writing to Maria Göppert-Mayer <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> <b>Hopkins</b> <b>University</b> and Rudi Ladenburg at Princeton University. Offers soon started to pour in, and he accepted one from St John's College, Cambridge. At Cambridge, he wrote a popular science book, The Restless Universe, and a textbook, Atomic Physics, that soon became a standard text, going through seven editions. His family soon settled into life in England, with his daughters Irene and Gritli becoming engaged to Welshman Brinley (Bryn) Newton-John (Olivia Newton-John's parents; Born is Olivia's grandfather and Irene is her mother) and Englishman Maurice Pryce respectively.|$|E

5|$|Melanie Barnett-Davis is {{a fictional}} character, portrayed by actress Tia Mowry, who {{appears in the}} American sitcom The Game, which aired on the CW Television Network and BET from 2006 to 2015. Introduced in a {{backdoor}} pilot on the sitcom Girlfriends as the cousin of Joan Clayton (Tracee Ellis Ross), Melanie chooses to support her boyfriend Derwin Davis' (Pooch Hall) career with the San Diego Sabres, a fictional National Football League (NFL) team, rather than attend medical school <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> <b>Hopkins</b> <b>University.</b> The series focuses primarily on Melanie and Derwin's complicated relationship, with her fears of his infidelity {{at the center of}} many of the episodes' storylines. Mowry left the series in 2012 upon learning that her role would be reduced as a result of co-star Pooch Hall's decision to leave The Game to appear in the crime drama series Ray Donovan. Both actors reprised their roles in the series' finale, in which Melanie gives birth to twins.|$|E
5|$|Ripken {{has made}} {{donations}} to many various charitable causes, including donations supporting research on Lou Gehrig's disease.

Between 2001 and 2004, inclusive, Ripken served as commissioner of the White House Tee Ball Initiative of President George W. Bush, in which capacity he worked to promote the value of teamwork amongst players and volunteership amongst the public and helped to teach tee ball fundamentals to teams of children at the White House.|$|E
