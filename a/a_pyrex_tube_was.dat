40|$|Glow {{discharges}} {{with different}} {{gases in the}} Large Helical Device (LHD) at the National Institute for Fusion Science (NIFS) show different visual colors of the plasma, and these colors are ascribed to different spectra in the UV and visible wavelength range. From the wavelengths of the observed emission lines, these gases are identified as neon, helium, and hydrogen. The emission line intensity is given by the upper level population density of the corresponding transition via the spontaneous transition probability or Einstein 2 ̆ 7 s A coefficient. On the assumption of corona equilibrium, relative emission line intensities of neutral helium are estimated for the to transitions. The results are in gross disagreement with the glow discharge spectrum. For a single pulsed helium discharge in <b>a</b> <b>Pyrex</b> <b>tube,</b> line emissions <b>are</b> intense during {{the beginning of the}} pulse and after the pulse [A. Hirabayashi, et al., Phys.

It is also found that the color of the plasma observed for a main discharge with helium in LHD is drastically different depending on the plasma condition, and never shows a similar color to that in the glow discharge. All these results indicate breakdown of corona equilibrium and demand us deeper considerations. ...|$|R

A study {{was made of the}} relationship between the electrode potential and the pH of the electrolyte solution. It was found that the number of electrons per hydrogen ion in the discharge reaction was unity at a pH between two and five. The electrode potential during discharge was plotted against the time of discharge and the resulting curves were compared with curves calculated upon a theory based upon diffusion of the reduction product into the solid electrode. It was found that the diffusion equation predicted the shape of the experimental curves. The diffusion coefficient for the discharge product was calculated from experimental discharge curves and the equations for diffusion. A diffusion coefficient of 3 x 10 ⁻¹⁸ cm² per sec was obtained. A mechanism for the discharge and recovery of the vanadium pentoxide electrode is proposed. It is suggested that the discharge consists of the reduction of the vanadium pentoxide to a lower oxy-hydroxide accompanied by an effective diffusion of the oxy-hydroxide by the migration of protons and electrons into the body of the electrode. The electrode potential is dependent upon the composition of the solid solution formed between the pentoxide and the oxy-hydroxide on the surface of the electrode. The recovery, after the discharge current is removed, consists of the further diffusion of the oxy-hydroxide away from the surface and the resulting increase in the activity of the pentoxide on the surface, until the composition is uniform throughout the electrode...|$|R

It also can be prepared by direct fluorination of niobium metal at 250 to 300 °C, either by fluorine gas or anhydrous hydrofluoric acid. The pentafluoride vapors are condensed in <b>a</b> <b>pyrex</b> or quartz <b>tube</b> from which it is sublimed at 120 °C under vacuum and collected as colorless crystals.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to study}} the effect of evaporator temperature, pitch distance, and working fluid on the internal flow pattern and the heat transfer characteristics of the helical oscillating heat pipe. <b>A</b> <b>Pyrex</b> <b>tube</b> with <b>an</b> inner diameter of 2. 4 mm was used {{to study the}} flow pattern in the evaporator section. The pitch distance varied at 1, 1. 5, and 2 cm. Water and R- 123 were used as working fluid with a filling ratio of 80 % by total volume. In the evaporator section, the water temperature varied at 60, 75, and 90 °C to supply heat to the heat pipe. In the condenser section, air with a temperature of 25 °C was used as heat sink. From the results, {{it was found that}} 4 internal flow patterns, bubble flow, slug flow, annular flow, and stratified wavy flow, were observed in the evaporator section for both working fluids. The heat transfer rate decreased when the pitch distance was increased from 1 to 2 cm. The maximum heat flux was 2, 132. 6 and 1, 773. 4 W/m 2 for the working fluid of R- 123 and water, respectively. Both occurred at a pitch distance of 1 cm and an evaporator temperature of 90 °C...|$|R

The photoreactor <b>is</b> made of <b>Pyrex</b> <b>tube</b> and <b>is</b> equipped with an irradiation device to study photochemical reactions in the UV and visible ranges. A UV-visible DOAS and a long-path FT-IR spectrometry device {{have been designed to}} perform analyses of trace components of reactional mixtures during atmospheric simulation experiments. These facilities are unique in France and new developments have been designed and performed in the analytical device to allow a very long path and high stability of the optical path. The entire apparatus is described and the results of calibration experiments are given...|$|R

Upon 254 nm light-irradiation of 2 gave rise to the formation of benzopyrimidosemibullvalene (4) in fair yields. The reaction pathway for the formation of 4 is reasonably explained in the terms of di-π-methane rearrangement. Adduct 3 was newly converted to the corresponding barrelene derivative (2) by long-wave-length irradiation {{in the presence}} of a triplet sensitizer...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} new {{experimental}} {{approach to the}} study of surface-catalysed nitric oxide production under plasma exposure. Stable nitrogen species are grafted to the surface of <b>a</b> <b>pyrex</b> discharge <b>tube</b> during N 2 plasma pretreatment. These species are trapped by surface active sites and on being exposed to O 2 plasma, they initiate the production of NO molecules, which are detected using tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy. Supposing that nitrogen species are adsorbed N atoms, we estimate the initial surface coverage as [Nads] = 3 × 1013 cm− 2. This gives an assessment of the lower boundary of the density of surface active sites...|$|R
5000|$|Jacobs’s Crypt of Civilization {{intrigued}} America and was duplicated by many others. [...] In the mid-1930s, George Edward Pendray, {{a public}} relations executive for the Westinghouse Electric Company, was given an assignment {{to come up with}} a promotional event for the 1939 New York World's Fair. Pendray, also an amateur rocketeer, suggested burying a [...] "time capsule", a sealed rocket-shaped vessel made of a metal alloy called [...] "cupaloy". The Westinghouse time capsule is a 7 ft rocket-shaped tube with a metal exterior that encapsulated articles in <b>a</b> <b>Pyrex</b> inner <b>tube.</b> Pendray’s project <b>was</b> originally named a [...] "time bomb", but the name was later changed to time capsule. Pendray’s time capsule is scheduled to be opened in under 61 centuries.|$|R
