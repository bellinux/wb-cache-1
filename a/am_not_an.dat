He clarified however that, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> atheist", preferring to call himself an agnostic, or a [...] "deeply religious nonbeliever".

500|$|Dworkin's {{short fiction}} and novels often {{incorporated}} elements from {{her life and}} themes from her nonfiction writing, sometimes related by a first-person narrator. Critics have sometimes quoted passages spoken by characters in Ice and Fire as representations of Dworkin's own views. cf. Dworkin, however, wrote [...] "My fiction is not autobiography. I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> exhibitionist. I do not show myself. I am not asking for forgiveness. I {{do not want to}} confess. But I have used everything I know—my life—to show what I believe must be shown {{so that it can be}} faced. The imperative at the heart of my writing—what must be done—comes directly from my life.

500|$|Eliot's poems have {{frequently}} been examined for instances of anti-Semitism—prejudice or discrimination against Jews. Scholar Louis Menand states that while Simeon is treated respectfully by Eliot, his characterisation is [...] "in {{the tradition of}} Christian condescension toward the virtuous heathen". [...] Comparatively, Craig Raine, a poet and an Emeritus Fellow of New College, Oxford, wrote a book-length defence of Eliot against the claims of deliberate anti-Semitism and argues that [...] "A Song for Simeon" [...] provides a sympathetic discussion of the Jewish diaspora. University of British Columbia scholar John Xiros Cooper states that the accusations of anti-Semitism lodged against Eliot rest [...] "on a few isolated lines of poetry" [...] and a passing reference in one prose text. Indeed, Eliot denied the claim, declaring, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> anti-Semite and never have been. It is a terrible slander on a man." [...] Political theorist and author Leonard Woolf, who was both Jewish and one of Eliot's close friends, believed that Eliot was [...] "slightly anti-Semitic {{in the sort of}} vague way which is not uncommon. He would have denied it genuinely." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout her career, Ayola {{has been}} outspoken {{on the subject}} of racial {{discrimination}} in the entertainment industry. Describing her motivation, she states: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> overtly political person. I just want fairness". Ayola believes that black actors receive less recognition than their white counterparts, explaining; [...] "If you get a show with six stars and one is black you are more likely to see interviews with the five white actors. [...] They are not being sold as a reason to watch." [...] She believes that her career would have taken her in a different direction were she not of ethnic origin, stating: [...] "I could not have played any of the roles I have played on TV if I was white [...] I am very aware of where the glass ceiling is and it's still very low and expectations are still very low". She has noted having casting directors accept the notion of characters being both black and Welsh to be a particular problem, explaining that: [...] "I get offered a lot of very different roles, but they're never Welsh. [...] The one time I was asked to play a Welsh character on screen was in Tiger Bay for BBC Wales, but I know if that series had been called Radyr Park or Cyncoed Close I wouldn't have been in it". In 2001, Ayola founded a production company and directed a short film entitled Persephone's Playground. She presented the film at the Cannes film festival, using it as part of her campaign for increased black representation in theatre, films and television. The project, however, was largely unsuccessful, with Ayola stating: [...] "it just made me decide that if there's anything I don't want to do, it's produce films, because I'm rubbish at it. I was so bad with the budget that I just said yes to everything and then had to worry about how to pay for things at the end." [...] In 2008, Ayola offered her support to the [...] campaign Dignity! Period, aiming to provide affordable sanitary protection to Zimbabwean women.|$|E

2500|$|Global civics {{suggests}} that civics can be understood, {{in a global}} sense, as a social contract between global citizens {{in the age of}} interdependence and interaction. The disseminators of the concept define it as the notion that we have certain rights and responsibilities towards each other by the mere fact of being human on Earth. World citizen has a variety of similar meanings, often referring to a person who disapproves of traditional geopolitical divisions derived from national citizenship. An early incarnation of this sentiment can be found in Socrates, whom Plutarch quoted as saying: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> Athenian, or a Greek, but a citizen of the world." [...] In an increasingly interdependent world, world citizens need a compass to frame their mindsets and create a shared consciousness and sense of global responsibility in world issues such as environmental problems and nuclear proliferation.|$|E

This reinforces the prince's convictions that grown-ups are a sad, dull, unimaginative lot. The geographer recommended that the prince next visit the planet Earth.|$|E
2500|$|Therefore, I beseeched the Lord {{to teach}} me His statutes. After my prayer as usual I opened my Bible with closed eyes and {{put my finger on}} the right place.

[...] And again I opened the Bible, that time on 1 Timothy 1:15"This is a {{faithful}} saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief."
