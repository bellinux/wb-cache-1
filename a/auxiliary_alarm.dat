40|$|A {{method and}} a device are {{provided}} for detecting lack of {{reaction of the}} crew of an aircraft to an alarm related to a path. The method includes monitoring the emitting condition of a plurality of alarms related to dangers {{in the path of}} the aircraft and monitoring a reaction of a crew during first and second time intervals determined based on how long the crew should take to response to the initial alarm in the first time interval and an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>alarm</b> in the second time interval. The method also includes implementing automatic avoidance operation for coping with the danger if the crew has not reacted to the alarms by the end of the second time interval...|$|E
25|$|MEMS Real-time clocks (RTCs) are ICs {{that track}} {{time of day}} and date. They include MEMS resonators, {{sustaining}} amps, and registers that increment with time, for instance counting days, hours, minutes and seconds. They also include <b>auxiliary</b> functions like <b>alarm</b> outputs and battery management.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile, {{how did he}} like it? Perhaps nobody, {{except his}} wife, for a moment {{reflected}} on that. An amused society considered that he was severely punished, but {{did not take the}} trouble to imagine his sensations; indeed this would have been a difficulty for persons less sensitive and excitable than Merman himself. Perhaps that popular comparison of the Walrus had truth enough to bite and blister on thorough application, even if exultant ignorance had not applauded it. But {{it is well known that}} the walrus, though not in the least a malignant animal, if allowed to display its remarkably plain person and blundering performances at ease in any element it chooses, becomes desperately savage and musters <b>alarming</b> <b>auxiliaries</b> when attacked or hurt. In this characteristic, at least, Merman resembled the walrus. And now he concentrated himself with a vengeance. That his counter-theory was fundamentally the right one he had a genuine conviction, whatever collateral mistakes he might have committed; and his bread would not cease to be bitter to him until he had convinced his contemporaries that Grampus had used his minute learning as a dust-cloud to hide sophistical evasions--that, in fact, minute learning was an obstacle to clear-sighted judgment, more especially with regard to the Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis, and that the best preparation in this matter was a wide survey of history and a diversified observation of men. Still, Merman was resolved to muster all the learning within his reach, and he wandered day and night through many wildernesses of German print, he tried compendious methods of learning oriental tongues, and, so to speak, getting at the marrow of languages independently of the bones, for the chance of finding details to corroborate his own views, or possibly even to detect Grampus in some oversight or textual tampering. All other work was neglected: rare clients were sent away and amazed editors found this maniac indifferent to his chance of getting book-parcels from them. It was many months before Merman had satisfied himself that he was strong enough to face round upon his adversary. But at last he had prepared sixty condensed pages of eager argument which seemed to him worthy to rank with the best models of controversial writing. He had acknowledged his mistakes, but had restated his theory so as to show that it was left intact in spite of them; and he had even found cases in which Ziphius, Microps, Scrag Whale the explorer, and other Cetaceans of unanswerable authority, were decidedly at issue with Grampus. Especially a passage cited by this last from that greatest of fossils Megalosaurus was demonstrated by Merman to be capable of three different interpretations, all preferable to that chosen by Grampus, who took the words in their most literal sense; for, 1°, the incomparable Saurian, alike unequalled in close observation and far-glancing comprehensiveness, might have meant those words ironically; 2°, motzis was probably a false reading for potzis, in which case its bearing was reversed; and 3°, it is known that in the age of the Saurians there were conceptions about the motzis which entirely remove it from the category of things comprehensible in an age when Saurians run ridiculously small: all which views were godfathered by names quite fit to be ranked with that of Grampus. In fine, Merman wound up his rejoinder by sincerely thanking the eminent adversary without whose fierce assault he might not have undertaken a revision in the course of which he had met with unexpected and striking confirmations of his own fundamental views. Evidently Merman's anger was at white heat.|$|R
