2500|$|The {{newspaper}} rejected {{being considered}} as [...] "subversive opposition" [...] and criticized Liberal president Julio César Turbay Ayala's government, which by its words wished to [...] "have a totally loyal, extremely pro-government press, not silenced but flattering." [...] To defend itself, the paper published 15 July 1979 a column named Si eso es opposición... ("If that's opposition...") In the same text, the newspaper declared itself [...] "neutral", considering that a democracy {{should not be}} polarized, [...] "because in the times we are living, newspapers are increasingly more independent from governments, more devoted entirely to report and guide according to their honest knowledge and understanding," [...] adding that the [...] "unanimous, one-way, uniformed, official press is (intended) for dictatorships and not for democracies... <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Colombia is still a democracy." ...|$|E

[...] On several occasions, Mussolini spoke positively about Jews and the Zionist movement, although Fascism remained suspicious of Zionism after the Fascist Party gained power. Until 1938 Mussolini had denied any antisemitism within the Fascist Party.|$|E

2500|$|On May 25, 1988, Sanford M. Gage, the O'Rourke family attorney, filed a {{wrongful}} death lawsuit against Kaiser Foundation Hospital in San Diego. [...] O'Rourke {{had been seen}} by doctors at Kaiser since birth, and the suit claimed that they failed to properly diagnose her long-standing small-bowel obstruction: had they not simply treated her for Crohn's disease with prescription drugs, she {{could have had a}} period of remission by means of a major bowel surgery; and this misdiagnosis caused O'Rourke's death. [...] Kaiser Permanente spokeswoman Janice Seib responded: [...] "We have reviewed the case extensively, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the diagnosis and the course of action taken by our physicians was entirely appropriate. It's a very complex case, complicated by a number of factors, and not given to any simple answers." [...] The case went to arbitration and was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.|$|E

60|$|I said Protestant--I say it again. What is the watchword of Protestantism? It is this. That no lie {{is of the}} truth. There {{are those}} who {{complain}} of us English that we attach too high a value to TRUTH. They say that falsehood is an evil: but not so great a one as we fancy. We accept the imputation. We answer boldly {{that there can be}} no greater evil than falsehood, no greater blessing than truth; and that by God's help we will teach the same to our children, and to our children's children. Free inquiry, religious as well as civil liberty--this is the spirit of Protestantism. This our fathers have bequeathed to us; this we will bequeath to our children;--to know that all truth is of God, that no lie is of the truth. Our enemies may call us heretics, unbelievers, rebellious, political squabblers. They may say in scorn, You Protestants know not whither you are going; you have broken yourselves off from the old Catholic tree, and now, in the wild exercise of your own private judgment, you are losing all that standard of doctrine, all unity of belief. Our answer will be--It is not so: but even if it were so-- even if we did not know whither we were going--we should go forward still. For though we know not, God knows. We have committed ourselves to God, the living God; and He has led us; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> He will lead us. He has taught us; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> He will teach us still. He has prospered us, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> He will prosper us still: and therefore we will train up our children after us to go on the path which has brought us hither, freely to use their minds, boldly to prove all things, and hold fast that which is good; manfully to go forward, following Truth whithersoever she may lead them; trusting in God, the Father of Lights, asking Him for wisdom, who giveth to all liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given them.|$|E
