40|$|Evaluating and {{choosing}} a financial product often requires a trade-off between risk and returns on investment, as <b>a</b> <b>riskier</b> product may yield a higher return. We examine {{the effect of}} different reference points (i. e., <b>a</b> <b>riskier</b> reference vs. <b>a</b> safer reference) on the evaluation of a financial product when attributes are explicitly traded off during the evaluation. Our findings suggest that a safer reference increases the attractiveness of the focal product under evaluation, while <b>a</b> <b>riskier</b> reference point does not affect that evaluation. The safer reference point appears to facilitate the risk-seeking tendency in financial decision-making. Further, two types of consumer knowledge, namely, objective and subjective, can moderate the effect of the reference point. Subjective knowledge negatively affects attribute-based objective evaluations, promoting instead the use of external reference information. A discrepancy between the two types of knowledge (i. e., over-confidence), in particular, can cause a more biased evaluation.

5|$|Although the {{accident}} rate per 100 million miles for professional truckers is low, {{the high number}} of miles driven by a truck driver makes truck driving <b>a</b> <b>risky</b> occupation. Trucking transportation occupations accounted for one quarter of all work-related fatalities in 2015, more than any other U.S. job, according to the U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics' annual workplace fatality report. The fatal injury rate in 2015 was 14.7 per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers in transportation and material moving occupations (which includes both truckers and air transportation workers.) This was a significantly lower rate than for workers in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations, but high compared to most other occupation categories. The report did not break out the fatal injury rate per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers among aircraft pilots and flight engineers but did note that they had a high fatal injury rate compared to all workers. There were 57 fatalities among aircraft pilots and flight engineers in 2015.|$|E

Workers striking in Szczecin formulated demands in the area of freely elected worker councils and union representatives. Gierek agreed, but the authorities soon marginalized and eliminated the worker leaders from the legally existing structures and their places of employment. The February 1971 Łódź strikes followed and concentrated on economic demands.

5|$|Henry became King of England {{following}} the death of William Rufus, who had been shot while hunting. On the afternoon of 2 August 1100, the King had gone hunting in the New Forest, accompanied by a team of huntsmen and a number of the Norman nobility, including Henry. An arrow was fired, possibly by the baron Walter Tirel, which hit and killed William Rufus. Numerous conspiracy theories have been put forward suggesting that the King was killed deliberately; most modern historians reject these, as hunting was <b>a</b> <b>risky</b> activity, and such accidents were common. Chaos broke out, and Tirel fled the scene for France, either because he had fired the fatal shot, or because he had been incorrectly accused and feared that he would be made a scapegoat for the King's death.|$|E

During preparations for one of many cancelled operations, Linnete II, his disagreement with Brereton over <b>a</b> <b>risky</b> operation caused him to threaten resignation, which, due to differences in military culture, Brereton regarded as tantamount to disobeying an order.

40|$|Using {{geometric}} illustrations, {{we investigate}} what implications of portfolio optimization in equilibrium {{can be generated}} by the simple mean-variance framework, under margin bor-rowing restrictions. First, we investigate the case of uniform marginability on all risky assets. It is shown that changing from unlimited borrowing to margin borrowing shifts the market portfolio to <b>a</b> <b>riskier</b> combination, accompanied by a higher risk premium and a lower price of risk. With the linear risk-return preference, more stringent margin requirements lead to <b>a</b> <b>riskier</b> market portfolio, contrary to the conventional belief. Second, we investigate the effects of differential marginability on portfolio optimization by allowing {{only one of the}} risky assets to be pledged as collateral. It is shown that the resulting optimal portfolio is not always tilted towards holding more of the marginable asset, when the margin requirement is loosened.

5|$|The cabinet settled upon <b>a</b> <b>risky</b> {{alternative}} {{to resolve the}} complicated situation in the Platine region. Instead of undertaking a period of conscription {{to build up the}} Brazilian Army, which would have been costly, the Council decided to rely on the standing army. It sent a contingent south to secure the region. Brazil held an advantage in possessing a powerful and modern navy, along with an experienced professional army hardened by years of internal and external warfare. Up until this point, no other nation in South America possessed true navies or regular armies. Rosas' and Oribe's forces were largely made up of irregular troops on loan from those caudillos who supported them. Even a decade later, Argentina could only field an army of 6,000 men. Brazil also decided to adopt Rosas' own tactics by financing his opponents to weaken him both internally and externally.|$|E

Fischer lost the first two games in strange fashion: the first when he played <b>a</b> <b>risky</b> pawn-grab in a drawn endgame, the second by forfeit when he refused to play the game in a dispute over playing conditions. Fischer would likely have forfeited the entire match, but Spassky, not wanting to win by default, yielded to Fischer's demands to move the next game to a back room, away from the cameras whose presence had upset Fischer. After that game, the match was moved back to the stage and proceeded without further serious incident. Fischer won seven of the next 19 games, losing only one and drawing eleven, to win the match 12½–8½ and become the 11th World Chess Champion.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} impact of the new Internal Rate Based (irb) Basel II capital {{requirements}} on the credit portfolio of banks and on their incentive to take risk. We show that for some initially risky banks, there is an incentive bias to finance <b>a</b> <b>riskier</b> credit bucket when they shift from Basel I to irb Basel II capital requirements. Basel II bank capital requirements are based on the default rate of each loan financed by a bank. This rate is measured by taking into account the specific risk of the credit (its own default probability) and its sensitivity to a systematic factor of risk. The relationship between these two risk factors (specific and systematic) is assumed to be decreasing with the default probability of a credit. This assumption implies that the marginal capital amount for a bank that finances <b>a</b> <b>riskier</b> credit is also decreasing. In order to appraise banks? incentive to finance risky projects, we compare this marginal decreasing amount of capital requirements with the increasing gain linked with the financing of riskier credits, which is measured by credit spreads. Under some conditions on the value of credit spreads, we show that the trade off between marginal cost and marginal gain may encourage initially risky banks under Basel I capital regulation to increase their level of risk under irb Basel II capital regulation. This incentive bias towards <b>a</b> <b>riskier</b> credit portfolio is in contradiction with Basel II?s main objective of reducing the global risk taken by banks. Classification JEL : G 11 ?

5|$|After Christie's {{return from}} his second combat patrol, Admiral Chester Nimitz {{recommended}} he and Lockwood meet in Brisbane and discuss joint submarine operations. During the visit, Lockwood and Christie discussed technical issues, {{as well as}} the establishment of advanced bases in Mios Woendi and Saipan. However, the meeting also resulted in some kind of personal rift between the two men. They had already clashed over the Mark 6 exploder and the Mark 14 torpedo, and some of Lockwood's staff believed Christie's ride in Harder was <b>a</b> <b>risky</b> and unnecessary stunt. After meeting with Lockwood, Christie met with MacArthur and related the events of Dealey's fifth war patrol to the general. MacArthur then decided to award Dealey a Distinguished Service Cross, and Christie the Silver Star. Additionally at this meeting, Christie found out his earlier recommendation for an army decoration to Griffith had apparently been blocked by Kinkaid. Despite Kinkaid's order regarding army decorations, MacArthur insisted on granting medals to the two men. Although Christie did not request the decorations, he was put on the spot and felt compelled to report the entire affair to Kinkaid. In the end, the general awarded the medals, displeasing Kinkaid.|$|E

He assumed the role of supreme commander of the armed forces during 1938, and subsequently made all major decisions regarding Germany's military strategy. His decision to mount <b>a</b> <b>risky</b> series of offensives against Norway, France, and the Low Countries in 1940 against the advice of the military proved successful, though the diplomatic and military strategies he employed in attempts to force the United Kingdom out of the war ended in failure. Hitler deepened his involvement in the war effort by appointing himself commander-in-chief of the Army in December 1941; from this point forward he personally directed the war against the Soviet Union, while his military commanders facing the Western Allies retained a degree of autonomy. Hitler's leadership became increasingly disconnected from reality as the war turned against Germany, with the military's defensive strategies often hindered by his slow decision making and frequent directives to hold untenable positions. Nevertheless, he continued to believe that only his leadership could deliver victory. In the final months of the war Hitler refused to consider peace negotiations, regarding the complete destruction of Germany as preferable to surrender. The military did not challenge Hitler's dominance of the war effort, and senior officers generally supported and enacted his decisions.|$|E
