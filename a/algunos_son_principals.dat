40|$|We {{investigate}} the integrability of the <b>SO(N)</b> <b>principal</b> chiral model on a halfline, {{and find that}} mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary conditions (as well as pure Dirichlet or Neumann) lead to infinitely many conserved charges classically in involution.

40|$|The genus Lagenophora {{was first}} {{described}} by Cassini {{under the name}} Lagenifera (in Bull. Soc.

Les fleurons sont mâles’. Two years later, in the same periodical (1818, p. 34) he changed the name Lagenifera without comment into Lagenophora, the latter being simply the latinized Greek equivalent of Lagenifera. Later authors have unanimously accepted the name Lagenophora, although Davis pointed out that Lagenifera has priority. Only recently Backer & Bakhuizen van den Brink Jr (Flora of Java 2, 1965, 381) have accepted the name Lagenifera, pointing {{out that this is}} the legitimate generic name, adding that Lagenophora is to be treated as an etymological variant.
