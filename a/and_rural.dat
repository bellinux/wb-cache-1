40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Rural</b> <b>and</b> remote health {{research}} has highlighted the many problems {{experienced in the}} bush. While attention to problems has raised awareness {{of the needs of}} <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> remote health, embedding a deficit perspective in research has stereotyped <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> remote health as poor environments to work in and as inherently problematic. The objectives of this paper are to challenge this thinking and suggest that a more balanced approach, acknowledging strengths, is beneficial. DESIGN: This discussion identifies why the deficit approach is problematic, proposes a strengths-based approach and identifies some key strengths of <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> remote health. RESULTS: This study suggests alternative ways of thinking about <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> remote practice, including the rewards of <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> remote practice, that <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> remote communities can act as change agents, that these disciplines actively address the social determinants of health, that <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> remote areas have many innovative primary health care services and activities <b>and</b> that <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> remote contexts provide opportunities for evaluation and research. It is proposed that <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> remote health can be viewed as problem-solving, thus dynamic and improving rather than as inherently problematic. CONCLUSION: Critical of a deficit approach to <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> remote health, this paper provides alternatives ways of thinking about these disciplines and recommends a problem-solving perspective of <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> remote health...|$|R

The focus is on girls’ education and development in a post – colonial country. Semi structured, qualitative interviews were conducted in Babati district, Tanzania in February 2011. In order to obtain as much useful information and data as possible several research questions were focused on during the fieldwork. These were: What is the perception on empowerment of women, according to local men <b>and</b> women in <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> urban Babati?, How does a gender gap in school affect development, according to local men <b>and</b> women in <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> urban Babati?, Is the patriarchal heritage an obstacle for development and gender equality, according to local men <b>and</b> women in <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> urban Babati?, Why are urban areas more equal than rural areas, according to local men <b>and</b> women in <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> urban Babati? The conclusion is that people in <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> urban areas are very similar in their opinions’ of empowerment of women and education for girls.

40|$|Background: Providing midwifery care in <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> remote <b>rural</b> regions can be {{challenging}} in many ways. This includes financial arrangements for midwives in New Zealand. This paper draws from a larger study exploring the lived experience of <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> remote <b>rural</b> families, midwives, general practitioners (GPs) and ambulance crews. Aim: The focus {{of this paper is}} on the financial lived experiences of the rural midwife participants in this study. Method: A qualitative study using hermeneutic phenomenology was used to explore the experiences of six rural midwives. Participants were from two regions in the South Island and two regions in the North Island and interviewed following ethical approval. Interviews were interpretively analysed. Findings: Several tensions surfaced in the study. Across these tensions it was evident that the current funding for <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> remote <b>rural</b> midwifery is not working well. The participants revealed the challenges and financial hardships which they as rural midwives experience in maintaining a local midwifery service and how these challenges adversely affect their wellbeing and safety. The themes, "cost of distance", "spirit of generosity exploited", "being treated unfairly" and "working rurally can be an expensive hobby", are uncovered through stories of <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> remote <b>rural</b> midwives. Conclusion: The current financial system does not serve these midwifery practitioners working in <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> remote areas. Without more financial support reflecting local needs, midwifery services in some of these rural regions are not sustainable and recruitment and retention {{will continue to be a}} challenge. There are Lead Maternity Carer (LMC) midwives working in <b>rural,</b> <b>and</b> in particular, remote rural regions who are concerned about the inequality and unfairness of remuneration. This may result in increasing the vulnerability of the maternity service for these regions. <b>Rural</b> <b>and</b> remote <b>rural</b> midwives' need for improved financial support is urgent and requires immediate attention at national level.
