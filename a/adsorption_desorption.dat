40|$|Water {{sorption}} {{tests of}} Roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) carried out under laboratory conditions are presented together with mathematical {{analyses of the}} moisture sorption isotherms (MSI’s). Moisture equilibrium data for <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> of water from Roselle powder were investigated at near ambient air temperatures {{in the range of}} 5 and 35 °C and water activity (Aw) ranging from 0. 11 to 0. 97. The manometric method has been used for water sorption tests. Models for MSI’s are exponential equations. Coefficients of determination are 0. 998 and 0. 996 (for <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> at 5 °C, respectively), 0. 998 and 0. 999 (for <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> at 20 °C, respectively), and 0. 998 and 0. 999 (for <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> at 35 °C, respectively). The equilibrium moisture content (EMC) of Roselle samples increased with an increase of Aw at a constant temperature both for <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption.</b> <b>Adsorption</b> curve equates to desorption curve at higher temperatures of tests carried out. Critical values of EMC of samples tested corresponding to the Aw equal to 0. 6 were between 13. 401 % moisture content wet basis (MC w. b.) and 15. 934 % MC (w. b.) for moisture <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption,</b> respectively.

50|$|A gas sensor {{composed}} of SWNHs could be fabricated with an electrokinetic method using dielectrophoresis (DEP). Conductanceof the DEP-fabricated SWNH sensor increased or decreased upon exposure to ppm-levels of NO2 or NH3, respectively, {{similar to the}} previously obtained CNT gas sensors {{which suggests that the}} SWNH aggregate behaves as a p-type semiconductor. The comparison reveals that intrinsic NO2 sensitivity of the SWNHs is lower than that of single-wall CNTs but comparable with the intrinsic sensitivity of multiple-wall CNTs (MWCNTs). Another gas sensor using coating film of SWHNs aimed to detect ozone in water. This sensor is based on the phenomena that the electric resistance of the SWNHs-film decreased with the adsorption of ozone molecules due to charge transfer from the surface of SWNHs to O3 molecules. The shift of the electric resistance of the SWNH-film was correlated with the ozone concentration and temperature based on monolayer adsorption model with consideration of activation energies of the relevant <b>adsorption,</b> <b>desorption,</b> and sensitivity of charge transfer.|$|E

One dimensional stair shaped line imposes geometrical constrain on the chain. Lattice model of fully directed self avoiding walk is used to model the chain, semiflexibility of the chain is accounted by introducing energy barrier for each bend of the chain. Exact expression of the partition function of the chain is obtained using generating function technique for the cases, viz. (i) constrained copolymer chain is in the bulk, (ii) constrained copolymer chain interacting with an impenetrable flat surface, (iii) constrained copolymer chain interacting with constraint itself and (iv) general expression of the partition function of the copolymer chain, interacting with a flat surface and geometrical constraint (stair shaped line).

Modern building materials used in the manufacture of wall panels, coatings and insulations are among the primary sources of VOCs that may affect adversely occupant health.

40|$|The {{functional}} role of organic acid anions in soil has been intensively investigated, with special focus on (i) microbial respiration and soil carbon dynamics, (ii) nutrient solubilization or (iii) metal detoxification and reduction of plant metal uptake. Little {{is known about}} the interaction dynamics of organic acid anions with the soil matrix and the potential impact of <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> processes on the functional significance of these effects. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize experimentally the <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> dynamics of organic acid anions in five agricultural soils differing in iron and aluminium oxide contents and using citrate as a model carboxylate. Results showed that both <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> processes were fast in all soils, reaching a steady state within approximately 1 hour. However, for a given total soil citrate concentration (ct) the steady state was critically dependent on the starting conditions of the experiment, whether most of the citrate was initially present in solution (cl) or held on the solid phase (cs). Specifically, desorption-led processes resulted in significantly smaller steady-state solution concentrations than adsorption-led processes, indicating that hysteresis occurred. As it is not possible to distinguish between different <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> pools in soil experimentally, a new dynamic hysteresis model that relies only on measured soil solution concentrations was developed. The model satisfactorily explained experimental data and was able to predict dynamic <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> behaviour. To demonstrate its use, we applied the model to two relevant situations involving exudation and microbial degradation. The study highlighted the complex nature of citrate <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> dynamics in soil. We conclude that existing models need to incorporate both temporal and hysteresis components to describe realistically the role and fate of organic acids in soil processes. © 2011 The Authors.
