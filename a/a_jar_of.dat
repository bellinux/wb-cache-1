5|$|Adding to Sparrow's woes, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) of the East India Trading Company has a {{personal}} score to settle with Sparrow. Beckett wants the chest and forces Will Turner to search for Sparrow and his magic compass. Turner locates Sparrow and his crew on Pelegosto, held captive by cannibals who intend to eat Sparrow. They escape, and voyage to Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris) (a magical woman later revealed to be the Goddess, Calypso, bound in human form as Dalma, and former lover of Jones). Dalma immediately sees destiny in Will, and provides Sparrow with <b>a</b> <b>jar</b> <b>of</b> dirt - Jones can only set foot on land once every 10 years, and since land is where Sparrow is safe, Dalma suggests with the dirt that he takes land with him.|$|E
5|$|Louis then targets Henry D'Ascoyne, a keen amateur photographer. He meets Henry and is {{charmed by}} his wife, Edith. He {{substitutes}} petrol for paraffin in the lamp of Henry's darkroom, with fatal results. Louis decides the widow is {{fit to be}} his duchess. The Reverend Lord Henry D'Ascoyne is the next victim. Posing as the Anglican Bishop of Matabeleland, Louis poisons his port. From {{the window of his}} flat, Louis then uses a bow to shoot down the balloon from which the suffragette Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne is dropping leaflets over London. Louis next sends General Lord Rufus D'Ascoyne <b>a</b> <b>jar</b> <b>of</b> caviar which contains a bomb. Admiral Lord Horatio D'Ascoyne presents a challenge, as he rarely sets foot on land. However, he insists on going down with his ship after causing a collision at sea.|$|E

5|$|When {{a key to}} {{a room at the}} Marina View Hotel is {{delivered}} inside <b>a</b> <b>jar</b> <b>of</b> blood to the Homicide Department, Sgt. James Doakes (Erik King) and Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter) visit the hotel, where they find a room completely covered in blood. Dexter is sent in first to investigate, but seeing the blood-covered room brings back a repressed memory from his childhood— Dexter at the age of three years sitting in a pool of blood—and he collapses and runs from the room. The forensics team surmises that the blood in the hotel room came from at least five different bodies, although none were in the room. Since there were only one set of footprints in the room, they assume that the victims were killed elsewhere and their blood spread around the room by the killer. Debra suggests that the Ice Truck Killer, who had five bloodless victims, may have been responsible.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not until}} 1883 {{that the cause of}} the Doterel {{explosion}} was settled. A surviving crew member of that ship, upon later smelling xerotine siccative while on board , stated that he had smelled it before the 1881 explosion. He explained to authorities that <b>a</b> <b>jar</b> <b>of</b> liquid had cracked while being moved below deck. Subsequent investigation revealed that just before the explosion in Doterel, two men were ordered to throw the jar overboard. While cleaning the leaking explosive liquid from beneath the forward magazine, the men may have broken the rule of not having an open flame below decks. The xerotine siccative exploded first, setting off the huge explosion in the forward magazine, which contained 4 tons and 7 cwt (4,456kg) of explosives.|$|E
