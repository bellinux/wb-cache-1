5|$|A {{building}} {{boom in the}} early 20th century gave Tulsa {{one of the largest}} concentrations of <b>art</b> <b>deco</b> architecture in the United States. Most commonly in the zigzag and streamline styles, the city's <b>art</b> <b>deco</b> is dotted throughout its older neighborhoods, primarily in downtown and midtown. A collection of large <b>art</b> <b>deco</b> structures such as the Mid-Continent Tower, the Boston Avenue Methodist Church, and the Philtower, have attracted events promoting preservation and architectural interest. In 2001, Tulsa served as the host city for the International <b>Art</b> <b>Deco</b> Congress, a semiannual event designed to promote <b>art</b> <b>deco</b> architecture internationally.|$|E
5|$|Chapel Allerton and to {{a lesser}} extent Headingley boast many <b>art</b> <b>deco</b> houses. Parts of the Leeds General Infirmary were built in <b>art</b> <b>deco</b> styles. Chapel Allerton also boasted the former Dominion Cinema, which was built in <b>art</b> <b>deco</b> style, however this closed in the late 1960s and became a bingo hall; which was later {{demolished}} in the 1990s. A Fish and chip shop in Oakwood retains its <b>art</b> <b>deco</b> front from the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|As the Great Depression wore on, <b>Art</b> <b>Deco</b> {{emerged as}} a popular {{building}} style, {{as evidenced by the}} Post Office building downtown. <b>Art</b> <b>Deco</b> consisted of streamlined concrete faced appearance with smooth stone or metal, with terracotta, and trimming consisting of glass and colored tiles.|$|E
5|$|In {{the modern}} period, the {{integration}} of architecture in the <b>Art</b> <b>Deco</b> style happened. Many of these examples {{can be seen in}} statues all over the country especially in public parks and spaces.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{minority}} of war memorials used some of the newer styles emerging in the inter-war period, such as modernism, realist and Art Nouveau approaches. As noted above, typically existing, traditional themes were preferred for memorials {{as a way of}} grounding mourning in a more familiar perspective. Nonetheless, some of the memorials to use the newer styles became particularly famous. There are a handful of memorials conducted in an <b>Art</b> <b>Deco</b> style, including the ANZAC War Memorial in Sydney which uses the delicate aspects of the <b>Art</b> <b>Deco</b> style to invoke sadness in the viewer, and is the only war memorial in the world to depict a naked soldier. The Douaumont Ossuary also draws on <b>Art</b> <b>Deco</b> principles in its structural architecture, avoiding straight lines in favour of gentle, soft, intersecting curves. Modernist principles were taken further in a small number of British memorials designed by Eric Gill, characterised by their highly abstract, simplified forms.|$|E
5|$|The 141 W. Jackson address {{hosted the}} former tallest {{building}} in Chicago designed by William W.

The current structure {{is known for its}} <b>art</b> <b>deco</b> architecture, sculptures and large-scale stone carving, as well as large trading floors. An aluminum, three-story <b>art</b> <b>deco</b> statue of Ceres, goddess of agriculture (particularly grain), caps the building.

5|$|Canterbury Castle, {{also known}} as Arlington Castle, was a private house located in {{southwest}} Portland, Oregon and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
