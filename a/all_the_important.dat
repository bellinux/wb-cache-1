5|$|The Orthodox Metropolitan See of Wallachia was {{recognized}} by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople in 1359. Wallachia issued its own currency under Vladislav I (1364c.1377). The earliest written information about Gypsies in modern Romania, a deed issued by Dan I of Wallachia (c.13831386) refers to Vladislav I's former donation of Gypsies to the Vodiţa monastery. Later on, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>important</b> monasteries and boyars owned Gipsy slaves.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the Muslim Wakf {{authority}} {{controlling the}} Islamic structures atop the Temple Mount began illegally excavating {{large amounts of}} fill from the former site of the Royal Stoa in order to construct a new access to the newly established (or, as the Waqf would put it, restored and expanded) Marwani Mosque. Material dug from the site was dumped in the Kidron Valley, so that <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>important</b> information {{which could have been}} acquired through proper excavation of the material in its archaeological context has been lost forever. Trying to save what could still be saved, an operation to sift through the debris was started by Zachi Zweig and Gabriel Barkay. The ongoing Temple Mount Sifting Project has resulted in the recovery of many architectural fragments from the Second Temple buildings as well as remnants from all other historical periods since the First Temple Period.|$|E
5|$|The 19th {{century was}} a {{turbulent}} time for Spain. Those {{in favour of}} reforming Spain's government vied for political power with conservatives, who tried to prevent reforms from taking place. Some liberals, in a tradition that had started with the Spanish Constitution of 1812, sought to limit {{the power of the}} monarchy of Spain and to establish a liberal state. The reforms of 1812 did not last after King Ferdinand VII dissolved the Constitution and ended a short-lived liberal government with French royalist military assistance. Twelve successful coups were carried out between 1814 and 1874. There were several attempts to realign the political system to match social reality. Until the 1850s, the economy of Spain was primarily based on agriculture. There was little development of a bourgeois industrial or commercial class. The land-based oligarchy remained powerful; a small number of people held large estates (called latifundia) as well as <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>important</b> government positions. The landowners' power was challenged by the industrial and merchant sectors, largely unsuccessfully.|$|E

5|$|The {{case for}} Hess's defence was {{presented}} from 22–26 March by his lawyer, Dr Alfred Seidl. He noted that while Hess accepted {{responsibility for the}} many decrees he had signed, he said these matters {{were part of the}} internal workings of a sovereign state and thus outside the purview of a war crimes trial. He called to the stand Ernst Wilhelm Bohle, the man who had been head of the NSDAP/AO, to testify on Hess's behalf. When Griffith-Jones presented questions about the organisation's spying in several countries, Bohle testified that any warlike activities such as espionage had been done without his permission or knowledge. Seidl called two other witnesses, former mayor of Stuttgart Karl Strölin and Hess's brother Alfred, both of whom refuted the allegations that the NSDAP/AO had been spying and fomenting war. Seidl presented a summation of the defence's case on 25 July, in which he attempted to refute the charge of conspiracy by pointing out that Hitler alone had made <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>important</b> decisions. He noted that Hess could not be held responsible for any events that took place after he left Germany in May 1941. Meanwhile, Hess mentally detached himself from what was happening, declining visits from his family and refusing to read the newspapers.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} role in the Clan is that of the leader. The Clan leader overlooks all duties of Clan life, and will make <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>important</b> decisions, such as whether or not to engage in battle. Each Clan leader is given nine lives by StarClan, in order to sacrifice their lives nine times over to protect their Clan, and to serve their clans for many more moons to come. This means that Clan leaders can often live longer than that of a normal cat. To mark their new status, Clan leaders are given the suffix –star (e.g. Bluestar, Tallstar, and Brokenstar). Generally, Clan leaders sleep alone, although male leaders are allowed to take a mate. Female leaders are inhibited from taking a mate or having kits, which has led to discussions of sexism among many fans of the series.|$|E

25|$|The first temples {{were mostly}} mud, brick, and marble {{structures}} on stone foundations.

25|$|However, most {{relations}} with the Mamluks were not as cordial. With {{the rise of the}} Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt in 1250, an even more dangerous and formidable enemy than the Ayyubids with heavy cavalry to match Crusader knights, the destruction of the remaining Crusader territories gathered pace. They also proved to be much more hostile. After the Battle of Ain Jalut, Mamluk forces began attacking Crusader holdings as early as 1261 under Sultan Baibars. In 1265, Caesarea, Haifa, and Arsuf all fell to the Sultan. The following year saw the loss of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>important</b> Latin holdings in Galilee. In 1268 Antioch was taken.|$|E
25|$|By 1850 Jung Bahadur had {{eliminated}} all of {{his major}} rivals, installed his own candidate on the throne, appointed his brothers and cronies to <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>important</b> posts, and ensured that major administrative decisions were made by himself as prime minister. At this point, he took the unprecedented step of travelling to Britain, France and Egypt leaving from Calcutta in April 1850 and returning to Kathmandu in February 1851. Although he unsuccessfully tried to deal directly with the British government while he was there, the main result of the tour was a great increase in goodwill between the British and Nepal. Recognizing the power of industrialised Europe, he became convinced that close co-operation with the British {{was the best way}} to guarantee Nepal's independence.|$|E
25|$|In ancient India, {{regardless}} of the religious beliefs of their kings, states usually treated <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>important</b> sects relatively even-handedly. This consisted of building monasteries and religious monuments, donating property such as the income of villages {{for the support of}} monks, and exempting donated property from taxation. Donations were most often made by private persons such as wealthy merchants and female relatives of the royal family, but there were periods when the state also gave its support and protection. In the case of Buddhism, this support was particularly important because of its high level of organisation and the reliance of monks on donations from the laity. State patronage of Buddhism took the form of land grant foundations.|$|E
