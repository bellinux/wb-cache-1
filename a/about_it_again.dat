25|$|After the airing, Murphy became uncharacteristically despondent and {{completely}} stopped all investigation {{on the case}} and {{refused to talk to}} anyone <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> and never gave clear reasons why. In February 1969, Murphy was struck and killed by an unidentified car in an apparent hit-and-run while crossing a road. The hit-and-run occurred near Ventura, California, while Murphy was on vacation.|$|E
25|$|Gomez, a {{longtime}} journalist, recalls having met and interviewed Duke {{in the mid-1970s}} when Duke was a state senate candidate:He {{was still in his}} mid-20s and very non-descript. Tall and slimly built, he had a very prominent nose, flat cheek bones, a slightly receding chin and straight dark brown hair. The interview turned out to be quite innocuous, and I hadn't thought <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> until Duke came to my legislative desk, and we shook hands. Who was this guy? Tall and well-built with a perfect nose, a model's cheek bones, prominent chin, blue eyes and freshly coiffed blond hair, he looked like a movie star. He obviously didn't remember from the radio encounter, and I was content to leave it at that.Consistent with Gomez's observation, Duke in the latter 1980s reportedly had his nose thinned and chin augmented. Following his election to the Louisiana House of Representatives, he shaved his mustache.|$|E
2500|$|I {{dropped the}} I-76 or the Imperial Japanese Navy Trans-Pacific Submarine {{down into the}} mouth of the Columbia River, dead duck. And it went down with a resounding furor. And that was that. I never thought <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> {{particularly}} except to get mad at all the admirals I had to make reports to because of this thing, see? This was one out of seventy-nine separate actions that I had to do with. And it had no significance, see? ...|$|E

50|$|Impulse later travels {{into the}} future, {{several years before}} the Legion is formed. He uses it to retreat from hostile forces. He is worried <b>about</b> <b>it</b> {{malfunctioning}} <b>again</b> but is reassured that the Flash of the 23rd century had made improvements. As such, Impulse is {{able to return to}} the appropriate time period.|$|R

2500|$|In 1984 Sholom Dov Wolpo {{published}} a booklet identifying Schneerson as the Messiah. Schneerson publicly denounced these actions several times. During {{one of these}} talks he said that those involved [...] were starting a new war against Chabad, {{and that he should}} never have to speak <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> On Shabbat Bereshit, when Wolpo began singing a song that had long been popular in Lubavitch, which referred to Schneerson as the messiah, he abruptly stopped the singing and ordered that it never be sung again.|$|E
2500|$|Quite a few critics {{cited the}} long and {{fragmented}} development time as {{a major factor in}} the finished product. In a positive review PC Gamer noted that [...] "years of anticipation will spoil Duke Nukem Forever for some", adding, [...] "There’s no reinvention of the genre here, no real attempt at grandeur... Check unrealistic expectations at the door and forget the ancient, hyperbolic promises of self-deluded developers", and concluded, [...] "Don’t expect a miracle. Duke is still the hero we love, but struggles to keep up with modern times." [...] Game Informer, whilst disappointed in the game concluded [...] "I'm glad Gearbox stepped up and finished this game, but after hearing about it for 12 years, I have no desire to relive any of it again. I’m now satisfied in my knowledge of what Duke Nukem Forever is and ready to never talk <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> Welcome back, Duke. I hope your next game (which is teased after the credits) goes off without a hitch." [...] GiantBomb however concluded that for those [...] "part of that faction that finds yourself so fascinated by this whole project that you need to know how it ends, I recommend you play Duke Nukem Forever for yourself. But I'd practically insist that you do so on the PC and try to wait for a sale. If you're not willing to play a sloppy, cobbled together first-person shooter just because it has some kind of weird historical meaning, though, just forget this ever happened and move on." [...] Jake Denton of Computer and Video Games wrote that parts of the game were fun to play and listed it as one of the [...] "5 most underrated games of 2011", while admitting the game's overall faulty structure. Also Joseph Milne of FPSguru.com featured the game on his list of [...] "Top 5 underrated games" [...] at number 4 on the list.|$|E

60|$|His cool, easy speech, his {{familiar}} swagger, the smile {{with which he}} regarded her did {{not in the least}} deceive Madeline. The gray was still in his face. Incomprehensible as it seemed, Nels had a dread, an uncanny fear, and it was of that huge white automobile. But he lied <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Here <b>again</b> was that strange quality of faithfulness.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll wait a bit," [...] advised Lisle. [...] "I'm {{a little}} worried <b>about</b> {{provisions}} <b>again.</b> <b>It's</b> still a long march to the nearest wagon trail." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{ought to}} be, but things aren’t always what {{they ought to}} be. Mother opens every letter that comes into the house, whoever it’s for. My sisters and I have made rows <b>about</b> <b>it</b> time and <b>again,</b> but she goes on doing it.” ...|$|R
60|$|His {{suggestion}} seemed, I say, {{an impossible}} dream {{to her on}} that day, {{but the next day}} they talked <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> and it was strangely less impossible.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to have a sight of them, and see if they really are the same man and woman whom I looked after {{yesterday}} morning in the waiting-room," [...] said Lomaque, putting his hand on the cell door, just as the deputy-jailer was <b>about</b> to close <b>it</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
60|$|As I {{opened the}} outer door, I {{saw the same}} clergyman who had already passed the house once, <b>about</b> to pass <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> {{on his way back}} through the square. I waited on the door-step to let him go by, and looked round, as I did so, at the parlour window.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hum! I {{expected}} as much," [...] observed Jack. [...] "When a bad shot {{points a}} bad gun at you, your best {{plan is to}} stand still and take your chance.

6000|$|... "I don't like {{packing a}} heavy load," [...] Deering admitted. [...] "We'll talk <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> {{and in the}} {{meantime}} you had better take the frying-pan from the fire. I hate my bannocks burned." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jefferson gave Kit a smile. [...] "You {{brought them}} back! We'll talk <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> I must get the anchor while there's water across the sand, and will {{put you on}} board Lucia before I start." ...|$|E
6000|$|Margaret smiled [...] "Perhaps {{you were}} not logical, but we'll talk <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> {{when we get to}} Green Lake. You mustn't talk now. I don't know if the trooper would stop long at the ranch, and we must cross the hill before the moon is up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and one has}} to say {{something}} about everybody," [...] Miss Allan added. [...] "That is what I find so difficult, saying something different about everybody." [...] Then she thought that she had said enough about herself, and she asked whether they had come down to join the tennis tournament. [...] "The young people are very keen <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> begins <b>again</b> in half an hour." ...|$|R
5000|$|An {{official}} {{press release}} <b>about</b> Play <b>It</b> <b>Again,</b> Dick and the network's other upcoming digital series was disseminated on May 5, 2014; it included a short synopsis {{of the show}} and set a vague release date of [...] "later this summer". According to one news outlet, the press release showed the fledgling series' capacity for self-referential humor and numerous celebrity guest appearances. A 20-second teaser trailer for the first episode was released on YouTube on September 8. A longer trailer was distributed on September 12, which featured an extended parody of the marketing campaign for The Newsroom.|$|R
5000|$|Rick's PerspectiveNotes"Another nearly album. It has {{too much}} {{variation}} within the music {{for me to be}} really happy <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and <b>again</b> I ended up in a studio that I really didn't like that was picked by the record company at the time and so I couldn't change. There's a mixture of great playing and some very poor playing as well. Most disappointing is the piano sound as the piano in the studio was cheap and nasty. There are a couple of classic tracks on the album though such as Happening Man which I would love to re-record one day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not let us {{talk about}} it now, old friend," [...] he said quietly. [...] "You and I put, before all other things, Aggie's happiness.

6000|$|... "Let's {{have another}} drink," [...] said Marston, who called a waiter and then resumed awkwardly: [...] "Elliot played up pretty well. I like the fellow; he's a sportsman, {{but after all}} I {{think it was a}} gull we saw. Anyhow, we won't bother <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> Why have you sold Red Rose?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, mother! I do {{hope you}} will be happy; but, please, don't let us talk <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> till--till it comes off; and, please, don't let him come here in the evening. I will try and get {{accustomed}} to it in time; but you see it's rather hard at first, and you know I didn't expect it." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{the door}} opened, the little white-headed child trotted forward towards the visitor, and Ethel entered on Clive's arm, {{who was as}} haggard and pale as death. Little Boy, {{looking up at the}} stately lady, still {{followed}} beside her, as she approached her uncle, who remained sitting, his head bent to the ground. His thoughts were elsewhere. Indeed he was following the child, and <b>about</b> to caress <b>it</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
5000|$|IndiaGlitz makes {{note that}} small budget films with [...] "relatively" [...] unknown actors {{occasionally}} do well due to promotion and word-of-mouth.

50|$|Throughout {{the episode}} Carina presses Sarah on her {{feelings}} for Chuck, very observantly recognizing {{that she has}} truly {{fallen in love with}} him.

Carina offers to talk <b>about</b> <b>it</b> but is <b>again</b> turned down.

6000|$|... "No, I {{went to see}} old Bell <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> yesterday, but he pooh-poohs it {{and tells}} {{me to go on}} rubbing in the {{liniment}} and get the footman to help when I am tired. Well, I obeyed orders, but it hasn't done me much good, and how the deuce rheumatism can give a fellow a bruise on the leg, I don't know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, papa; I {{have not}} said that. I was joking when I asked whether you wished to lose me. Of {{course you do}} not want to lose me."

6000|$|... "She {{never will}} say so; {{and a good}} while ago she made me promise not {{to speak to her}} <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> And she has set her mind {{especially}} against my being a clergyman; I know that. But I can't give her up. I do think she cares about me. I saw Mrs. Garth last night, and she said that Mary was staying at Lowick Rectory with Miss Farebrother." ...|$|E

I {{dare not}} offend these {{people with whom}} I have promised to dine, and apart from that, I {{think it is very}} unwise that I should spend any time at all here with you. You know what sort of a person it is whom we both have to consider. She would turn us both into the street and treat it all as a jest, if it pleased her. I tell you frankly, Violet, I have been too near {{starvation}} once to care <b>about</b> facing <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> I am going to send you back to the station in the car now.
