Combat is turn-based, with enemies facing against a four-member party {{made up of}} the protagonist and three chosen demons. Combat is governed by a derivative of the Press Turn system used in : in Strange Journey, the relevant system is called the Demon Co-op System. If the player group strikes their opponent's weak point, any allied demon of the attacker's <b>aliment</b> will follow up with an unblockable attack which deals high damage.|$|E

His right hand was cut off before he was hanged, and the pistol he had used for the murder was placed around his neck. Rachel Chiesley's birthday is unknown but she was baptised on 4 February 1679 and was probably born shortly before then, making her about ten {{years old at the time}} of her father's execution.|$|E

500|$|Steven Maeda, the writer, had {{previously}} written eighth season episodes [...] "Redrum" [...] and [...] "Vienen". Due to their success, Maeda {{was asked to}} pen a ninth season stand alone episode. His efforts were hampered by the fact that, due to the departure of David Duchovny, the general circumstances of The X-Files had become more difficult. The plot for [...] "4-D" [...] {{was inspired by the}} situation of a real-life French journalist, Jean-Dominique Bauby. Bauby had been paralyzed and could only communicate by blinking his left eyelid. Maeda wanted to employ a similar type of <b>aliment</b> in his script, and originally thought of drawing up a guest character for this purpose. However, he eventually felt that the plot would be more successful with a regular character, and decided to use Doggett. Maeda employed the theory of parallel universes in order to explain the circumstances of the episode. The character of Lukesh was in part inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho. Maeda later noted that he wished to create a villain that would be as memorable as other antagonists in The X-Files, such as Eugene Victor Tooms and The Flukeman.|$|E

2500|$|Rottmann {{described}} {{medical care}} as [...] “marginal”. A shortage of doctors, medical equipment and drugs meant those wounded often died, usually in immense pain. Morphine was {{unknown in the}} Red Army. Most Red Army soldiers had not received preventive inoculations and diseases were major problems with malaria, pneumonia, diphtheria, tuberculosis, typhus, dysentery, and meningitis in particular regularly sickening Red Army men. In the winter frostbite often sent soldiers to the medical system while {{in the spring and}} fall rains made trench foot a common <b>aliment.</b> The frontovik were paid once every month, but often did not receive their wages. All soldiers were exempt from taxes. In 1943, a private was paid 600 roubles per month, a corporal 1,000 roubles, a junior sergeant 2,000 roubles and a sergeant 3,000 roubles. There was special pay for those serving in guards units, paratroopers, tank, anti-tank and those decorated for bravery in combat. Those units that greatly distinguished in combat had the prefix Guards attached to their unit title, a title of great respect and honor that brought better pay and rations. In the Imperial Russian Army, the elite was always the Imperial Guards Regiments, and the title Guards when applied to a military unit in Russia still has elitist connotations.|$|E

The house, once set in extensive grounds, is now surrounded by tenements and is located on Orwell Place. It was built probably for and later owned and occupied by the Chiesley family. The house was reputedly haunted {{by a member of the}} family called John Chiesley. John Chiesley, the local landowner was married to Margaret Nicholson. The marriage was said to be unhappy (although it gave children including Rachel Chiesley, Lady Grange) and Margaret took her husband to court for <b>aliment.</b> She was awarded 1,700 merks by Sir George Lockhart of Carnwath, the Lord President of the Court of Session. Furious with the result, [...] John Chiesley shot the judge, Lockhart, dead near his home in Old Bank Close off the Lawnmarket as he walked home from church on Easter Sunday, 31 March 1689. Chiesley made no attempt to escape and confessed at his trial, held before the Lord Provost the next day. Two days later he was taken from the Tolbooth to the Mercat Cross on the High Street. His right hand was cut off before he was hanged, and the pistol he had used for the murder was placed round his neck. According to Robert Chambers writing in 1824, [...] "The body was stolen from the gallows, as was supposed, by his friends, and it was never known what had become of it, till more than a century after, when, in removing the hearth-stone of a cottage in Dairy Park, near Edinburgh, a human skeleton was found, with the remains of a pistol near the situation of the neck.
