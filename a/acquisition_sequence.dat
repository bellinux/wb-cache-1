50|$|Five {{minutes after}} liftoff, the Atlas and Agena-Mariner separated, {{followed}} by the first Agena burn and second Agena burn. The Agena-Mariner separation injected the Mariner 2 spacecraft into a geocentric escape hyperbola at 26 minutes 3 seconds after liftoff. The NASA NDIF tracking station at Johannesburg, South Africa, acquired the spacecraft about 31 minutes after launch. Solar panel extension was completed approximately 44 minutes after launch. The Sun lock acquired the Sun about 18 minutes later. The high-gain antenna was extended to its acquisition angle of 72°. The output of the solar panels was slightly above the predicted output. As all subsystems were performing normally, as the battery was fully charged, and the solar panels were providing adequate power, {{the decision was made}} on August 29 to turn on cruise science experiments.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the <b>acquisition</b> <b>sequence</b> of two pairs of contrasting terms in English.

40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} the noise of echo-planar {{functional}} magnetic resonance imaging on auditory cortex responses were compared for two methods of acquiring functional MR data. Responses observed with a distributed volume <b>acquisition</b> <b>sequence</b> were compared to those obtained with a clustered volume <b>acquisition</b> <b>sequence.</b> In the former case, slices from the volume were acquired at equal intervals within the repetition time, whereas the latter acquired all slices in rapid succession {{at the end of the}} imaging period. The clustered volume acquisition provides a period of quiet during which a stimulus may be presented uninterrupted and uncontaminated by the noise of echo-planar imaging. Both sequences were implemented on a General Electric Signa imager retrofitted for echo-planar imaging by Advanced NMR Systems, Inc. The sequences were used to acquire 60 images per slice of a fixed volume of cerebral cortex while subjects were presented an instrumental music stimulus in an On vs. Off paradigm. Data were acquired for both sequences using TR values of 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 sec. The clustered volume <b>acquisition</b> <b>sequence</b> was found to yield greater measures of dynamic range (percent signal change, mean statistical power per unit imaging time) across the tested range of TR values. Observations of more consistent spatial extent of responses, greater mean signal changes, and higher and more consistent values of mean t-statisti...|$|E

40|$|The elastic {{registration}} of medical scans from different <b>acquisition</b> <b>sequences</b> {{is becoming an}} important topic for many research labs {{that would like to}} continue the post-processing of medical scans acquired via the new generation of high-field-strength scanners. In this note, we present a parameter-free registration algorithm that is well suited for this scenario as it requires no tuning to specific <b>acquisition</b> <b>sequences.</b> The algorithm encompasses a new numerical scheme for computing elastic registration maps based on the minimizing flow approach to optimal mass transport. The approach utilizes all of the gray-scale data in both images, and the optimal mapping from image A to image B is the inverse of the optimal mapping from B to A. Further, no landmarks need to be specified, and the minimizer of the distance functional involved is unique. We apply the algorithm to register the white matter folds of two different scans and use the results to parcellate the cortex of the target image. To the best of our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that the optimal mass transport function has been applied to register large 3 D multimodal data sets. 27...|$|R
