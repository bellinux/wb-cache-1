5|$|A {{systematic}} review in 2012 found and analysed four randomized controlled trials of ketogenic diet in children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> with epilepsy, {{as well as}} six prospective and five retrospective studies. The trials were done among children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> for whom drugs failed to control their seizures, and {{only one of the}} trials compared a group assigned to ketogenic diet with a group not assigned to one. The other trials compared types of diets or ways of introducing them to make them more tolerable. Nearly 40% of the children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> had half or fewer seizures with the diet compared with the group not assigned to the diet. Only about 10% were still on the diet after a few years. Adverse effects such as hunger and loss of energy in that trial were common, with about 30% experiencing constipation.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to analyse the {{purchase}} of children's <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> literature in public libraries in Austria, namely which sources librarians use for the selection of children's <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> literature <b>and</b> which factors they take into consideration when selecting a book. The research methods have taken a combined approach that has included both quantitative and qualitative research methods. The quantitative data are collected by sending out an email-based questionnaire. First, the questionnaires are analysed, which then {{formed the basis for}} the guided interview. Afterwards, a guided interview with the librarians of the libraries in question was carried out to collect information about the purchase of children's <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> literature. In conclusion, {{it was found that the}} purchase of children's <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> literature is based mainly on assumed interests of the readers and not on pedagogical, literary, nor educational aspects. The analysis of the questionnaire showed that there is a link between the proportion of children’s <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> literature <b>and</b> the size of the library. It was found that mass media, for example radio and TV are seldomly used for selecting children’s <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> literature, while lists of recommendations, professional journals and recommendations on advanced training are often used as selection sources...|$|R

5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication {{is used by}} individuals to compensate for severe speech-language impairments in the expression or comprehension of spoken or written language. People making use of AAC include individuals {{with a variety of}} congenital conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual disability, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and aphasia. Prevalence data vary depending on the country and age/disabilities surveyed, but typically between 0.1 and 1.5% of the population are considered to have such severe speech-language impairments that they have difficulty making themselves understood, and thus could benefit from AAC. An estimated 0.05% of children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> require high technology AAC. Well-known AAC users include physicist Stephen Hawking, broadcaster Roger Ebert and poet Christopher Nolan. Award-winning films such as My Left Foot and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, based on books by AAC users Christy Brown and Jean-Dominique Bauby respectively, have brought the lives of those who use AAC to a wider audience.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, the UK anti-poverty fundraiser Comic Relief asked three best-selling British authors– cookery {{writer and}} TV {{presenter}} Delia Smith, Bridget Jones creator Helen Fielding, and Rowling– to submit booklets {{related to their}} most famous works for publication. Rowling's two booklets, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch Through the Ages, are ostensibly facsimiles of books found in the Hogwarts library. Since going on sale in March 2001, the books have raised £15.7million for the fund. The £10.8million they have raised outside the UK have been channelled into a newly created International Fund for Children <b>and</b> <b>Young</b> <b>People</b> in Crisis. In 2002 Rowling contributed a foreword to Magic, an anthology of fiction published by Bloomsbury Publishing, helping {{to raise money for}} the National Council for One Parent Families.|$|E

During his lifetime, two police investigations had looked into reports about Savile, the earliest known being in 1958, but none had led to charges; the reports had each {{concluded that there was}} insufficient evidence for any charges to be brought relating to sexual offences. In October 2012, it was announced that the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, would investigate why proceedings against Savile in 2009 were dropped.|$|E

5|$|The Curriculum for Excellence, Scotland's {{national}} school curriculum, presently provides the curricular framework for children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> from age 3 to 18. All 3- and 4-year-old children in Scotland {{are entitled to}} a free nursery place. Formal primary education begins at approximately 5 years old and lasts for 7 years (P1–P7); children in Scotland study Standard Grades, or Intermediate qualifications between the ages of 14 and 16. These are being phased out and replaced by the National Qualifications of the Curriculum for Excellence. The school leaving age is 16, after which students may choose to remain at school and study for Access, Intermediate or Higher Grade and Advanced Higher qualifications. A small number of students at certain private, independent schools may follow the English system and study towards GCSEs and A and AS-Levels instead.|$|E

The audio book edition, narrated by Neela Vaswani, won the 2015 Grammy Award for Best Children's Album. In February 2014, she was nominated for the World Children's Prize in Sweden. Even though she was fighting for women's rights as well as children's rights, she did not describe herself as feminist when asked on Forbes Under 30 Summit in 2014. In 2015, however, Yousafzai told Emma Watson she decided to call herself a feminist after hearing Watson's speech at the UN launching the HeForShe campaign. In May 2014, Yousafzai was granted an honorary doctorate by the University of King's College in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Later in 2014, she was announced as the co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize, along with Kailash Satyarthi, for her struggle against the suppression of children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> and for the right of all children to education.

5|$|Pastor H.J. Pedersen, {{like most}} early pastors in the synod, had {{received}} his training in a folk school, {{and he was}} convinced that the success of the new congregation and colony depended on the establishment of such a Danish-speaking folk school. Danebod Folk School opened December1, 1888, with Pedersen as president. Other teachers were Carl Hansen and Christian Hansen. Among the first students were Niels Petersen and Kristian Klink, both Danish immigrants. Klink was a stonemason educated in Denmark, and he helped pastor Pedersen in building the Stone Hall. It was built of native rock. Farmers hauled rocks from the shores of Swan Lake just south of Danebod, and Klink and his helpers split and shaped the rocks. The Stone Hall was finished in the fall of 1889, and the first public gathering in the Stone Hall was at Klink's funeral in November 1889. The Stone Hall quickly became the center of the new colony, and Sunday services were conducted here, as well as numerous weddings, baptisms and funerals. The students at the Danebod Folk School used the building as a gym hall, <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> would meet here to socialize, meet up with friends, and participate in singing games. Three years later, the Stone Hall was now too small for worship services. It was decided to build a new church, and the Cross Church at Danebod was dedicated on Sunday, June16, 1895.|$|E
