5|$|In several Western {{countries}} it {{has been}} seen that absences due to sickness for women are far greater than men. When investigating the reasons behind this, a study done in Sweden published in 1996 found {{that half of the}} difference between genders can be dismissed if you take out the days missed by pregnant women. When taking into account the health effects of double burden, child birth is always a possibility for mothers who <b>already</b> <b>are</b> faced with taking care of children and having a career and effects them and their health. In many studies people have tried to relate the difference in sickness absences directly to the double burden effect. It has been somewhat successful as women who are faced with work and child care have been known to request more sick days than men in the same situation. Additionally, working wives with children have twice the absence rate as men who are placed in the same position in work family conflicts.|$|E
25|$|Further explanation: Speakers who {{use this}} {{intonation}} pattern {{do not do}} so categorically, but instead also end many questions with a rising pitch. Such speakers typically use falling pitch for yes/no questions for which they <b>already</b> <b>are</b> quite sure of the answer. So, a speaker uttering the above example is simply confirming what they think they already know, that yes, the person they're talking to is painting his/her garage.|$|E
25|$|Legal {{immigration}} to the U.S. increased from 250,000 in the 1930s, to 2.5 million in the 1950s, to 4.5 million in the 1970s, and to 7.3 million in the 1980s, before resting at about 10 million in the 1990s. Since 2000, legal immigrants to the United States number approximately 1,000,000 per year, of whom about 600,000 are Change of Status who <b>already</b> <b>are</b> in the U.S. Legal immigrants to the United States now are at their highest level ever, at just over 37,000,000 legal immigrants. Illegal immigration may {{be as high as}} 1,500,000 per year with a net of at least 700,000 illegal immigrants arriving every year. Immigration led to a 57.4% increase in foreign born population from 1990 to 2000.|$|E

25|$|As {{a general}} rule, ZFS {{allocate}} writes across vdevs {{based on the}} free space in each vdev. This ensures that vdevs which have proportionately less data <b>already,</b> <b>are</b> given more writes when new data is to be stored. This helps to ensure that as the pool becomes more used, the situation does not develop that some vdevs become full, forcing writes to occur on {{a limited number of}} devices. It also means that when data is read (and reads are much more frequent than writes in most uses), different parts of the data can be read from as many disks as possible at the same time, giving much higher read performance. Therefore, as a general rule, pools and vdevs should be managed and new storage added, so that the situation does not arise that some vdevs in a pool are almost full and others almost empty, as this will make the pool less efficient.|$|E
25|$|The new route, {{likely to}} receive the {{designation}} of SL3, will begin at South Station and run through the Waterfront Tunnel, along with the SL1 and SL2 routes, to Silver Line Way, continuing with the SL1 through the Ted Williams Tunnel. The new route would then diverge to meet the Blue Line at Airport Station, and follow the Coughlin Bypass Road (a half-mile commercial-use-only road which opened in 2012) to the Chelsea Street Bridge. After the bridge, it will run up the abandoned section of the Grand Junction Railroad right-of-way, with stops at Eastern Avenue, Box District (at the end of Highland Street), Bellingham Square (at the former Chelsea commuter rail station), and Chelsea (at Mystic Mall), next to the new Chelsea commuter rail station. There will be no direct service to the Logan Airport terminals, which <b>already</b> <b>are</b> served by the SL1 route. Passengers from Chelsea {{will be able to}} access the airport via Massport shuttle buses from Airport Station. In addition to serving Chelsea, the new line will provide Blue Line riders a direct connection to the waterfront area and South Station.|$|E
25|$|Another trope of operas is the deus ex machina, {{in which}} the protagonist is saved {{at the last minute}} by divine intervention. This is a useful {{technique}} to quickly wrap up a story and make a happy ending, and has been used in drama many times. In Mahagonny, though there are no supernatural occurrences for most of the opera, there is in fact a deus ex machina; God himself comes to Mahagonny right before Jimmy is executed. The typical opera would have God solving all the problems {{just in time for the}} end of the opera, but Mahagonnys god does not. He does not even acknowledge that Jimmy is tied up and ready to be killed, but at least tries to fix the moral problems in Mahagonny. He tries to convince them to give up their degraded way of life, but the residents all refuse the offer. God then tells them literally to go to hell, but the people are not even offended; they proclaim that they <b>already</b> <b>are</b> in hell so that is no punishment. After fixing nothing, God then lets Jimmy have his say. Jimmy realizes that money did not buy him happiness or freedom, and he has learned his lesson. However, God does not spare him even then, and Jimmy is executed off-stage.|$|E

500|$|The {{percentage}} of Christians {{in the town}} has been steadily declining over the years, primarily due to emigration. The lower birth rate of Christians also accounts {{for some of the}} decline. In 1947, Christians made up 85% of the population, but by 1998 the figure had declined to 40%. In 2005, the mayor of Bethlehem, Victor Batarseh explained that [...] "due to the stress, either physical or psychological, and the bad economic situation, many people are emigrating, either Christians or Muslims, but it is more apparent among Christians, because they <b>already</b> <b>are</b> a minority." [...] The Palestinian Authority is officially committed to equality for Christians, although there have been incidents of violence against them by the Preventive Security Service and militant factions. The only mosque in the Old City is the Mosque of Omar, located in the Manger Square.|$|E
500|$|Browder put the character's {{direction}} {{into the}} hands of the writers but thought that the audience would define Mitchell through the character's actions and words and not by his backstory in the end. He wanted to humanize the character without letting him be entirely dictated by military terms, while turning him slowly into as much a hero as the other SG-1 team members <b>already</b> <b>are.</b> Producer Robert C. Cooper, who wrote Mitchell's introduction in the first three episodes of season 9, wanted Mitchell to be enthusiastic about exploring the galaxy from the beginning. Mitchell should be a [...] "super fan" [...] of SG-1 and a [...] "Stargate geek", mirroring the Stargate fandom. Browder did not want the character's first on-screen reaction to be enthusiasm, so the character was written to be stoic and guarded around General Landry in the first scenes. Cooper incorporated Mitchell into a flashback to a memorable SG-1 scene from season 7's [...] "Lost City" [...] to avoid a contrived heroic action by Mitchell in the season 9 opener.|$|E

500|$|Soule's {{greatest}} musical influences are [...] "Debussy's {{exploration of}} harmony", [...] "Wagner's grand operas", and [...] "Mozart's form and composition". While {{many of his}} orchestral works are based on movie scores in terms of scope, he does not often listen to movie scores, though he names his favorite composer as John Williams. The influence has been noted by critics, who have termed Soule [...] "the John Williams of video game music". Among video game music influences, he has cited Square for providing him [...] "with the education for what quality means to this business" [...] and Nobuo Uematsu in particular. His favorite style of music to listen to is British pop and rock music, while his favorite video games {{are the ones that}} he has written scores to, especially the ones made by Chris Taylor, though one of his all-time favorites is The Legend of Zelda. He has said that the games he would most like to work on that he has not <b>already</b> <b>are</b> ones by Shigeru Miyamoto, a Final Fantasy game, and a Metroid game.|$|E

The new government created the Ministry of Natural Resources Use and Environmental Protection in July 1992, with departments responsible for environmental protection, protection of flora and fauna, forestry, hydrometeorology, and administrative planning. Like other CIS republics, Turkmenistan has established an Environmental Fund based on revenues collected from environmental fines, but the fines generally are too low to accumulate significant revenue. Thanks to the former Soviet system of game preserves and the efforts of the Society for Nature Conservation and the Academy of Sciences, flora and fauna receive some protection in the republic; however, [...] "hard-currency hunts" [...] by wealthy Western and Arab businesspeople <b>already</b> <b>are</b> depleting animals on preserves.|$|E
2500|$|The {{presence}} of cognitive reserve implies {{that people with}} greater reserve who <b>already</b> <b>are</b> suffering neuropathological changes in the brain will not {{be picked up by}} standard clinical cognitive testing. Conversely anyone who has used these instruments clinically knows that they can yield false positives in people with very low reserve. From this point of view the concept of [...] "adequate level of challenge" [...] easily emerges. Conceivably one could measure cognitive reserve and then offer specifically tailored tests that would pose enough level of challenge to accurately detect early cognitive impairment both in individuals with high and low reserve. This has implications for treatment and care. Currently some people who would be eligible for it are not offered treatment while it may be offered in other cases needlessly.|$|E
