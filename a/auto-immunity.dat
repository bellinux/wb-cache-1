5000|$|Under {{the immune}} network theory, {{the main cause}} for {{progression}} to AIDS after HIV infection is not the direct killing of infected T helper cells by the virus. Following an infection with HIV that manages to establish itself, there is a complex interaction between the HIV virus, the T helper cells that it infects, and T suppressor cells. These three quasispecies apply selective pressure on one another and co-evolve {{in such a way}} that the viral epitopes eventually come to mimick the V regions of the main population of T suppressor cells. Once this happens, anti-HIV antibodies can bind to and kill most of the host's T suppressor cell population. This results in the dysregulation of the immune system, and eventually to other further anti-self reactions, including against the T helper cell population. At that point, the adaptive immune system is completely compromised and AIDS ensues. Hence in this model, the onset of AIDS is primarily an auto-immune reaction triggered by the cross-reaction of anti-HIV antibodies with T suppressor cells. Once this induced <b>auto-immunity</b> sets in, removing the HIV virus itself (for instance via HAART) would not be sufficient to restore proper immune function. The co-evolution of the quasispecies mentioned above will take a variable time depending on the initial conditions at the time of infection (i.e. the epitopes of the first infection and the steady state of the host's immune cell population), which would explain why there is a variable period, which differs greatly between individual patients, between HIV infection and the onset of AIDS. It also suggests that conventional vaccines are unlikely to be successful, since they would not prevent the auto-immune reaction. In fact such vaccines may do more harm in certain cases, since if the original infection comes from a source with a [...] "mature" [...] infection, those virions will have a high affinity for anti-HIV T helper cells (see above), and so increasing the anti-HIV population via vaccination only serves to provide the virus with more easy targets.|$|E

40|$|In plant effector-triggered {{immunity}} (ETI), intracellular nucleotide binding-leucine rich repeat (NLR) receptors are {{activated by}} specific pathogen effectors. The Arabidopsis TIR (Toll Interleukin 1 receptor domain) -NLR (denoted TNL) gene pair, RPS 4 and RRS 1, confers resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (Pst) strain DC 3000 expressing the Type III-secreted effector, AvrRps 4. Nuclear accumulation of AvrRps 4, RPS 4 and the TNL resistance regulator EDS 1 {{is necessary for}} ETI. RRS 1 possesses a C-terminal ‘WRKY’ transcription factor DNA binding domain suggesting that important RPS 4 /RRS 1 recognition and/or resistance signaling events occur at the nuclear chromatin. In Arabidopsis accession Ws- 0, the RPS 4 Ws/RRS 1 Ws allelic pair governs resistance to Pst/AvrRps 4 accompanied by host programmed cell death (pcd). In accession Col- 0, RPS 4 Col/RRS 1 Col effectively limits Pst/AvrRps 4 growth without pcd.

40|$|To {{unravel the}} complex {{relationships}} between cytomegalovirus-induced-, autoimmune-induced responses, microbial translocation and chronic immune activation (CIA) in successfully treated HIV-infected patients {{and to explore}} the mediating role of alpha-interferon in these processes. Cross-sectional study nested in the ANRS CO 3 Aquitaine Cohort, a prospective hospital-based cohort of HIV- 1 -infected patients in South-Western France. Patients initiated antiretroviral therapy between 2005 and 2008 and were treated with sustained virological suppression {{for at least two}} years. CIA was defined by the percentage of HLA-DR+/CD 38 + among CD 8 +T-cells. Integrative analyses were performed using structural equation modelling (SEM). The main analysis was performed in 57 HLA-A* 0201 positive patients, due to availability of percentages of actin-, vimentin-, lamin-specific CD 8 +T-cells (HLA-A 2 -restricted tests) to further characterize autoimmune response. Cytomegalovirus-induced response was assessed by Quantiferon and pp- 65 ELISPOT. SEM revealed a direct effect of cytomegalovirus-induced response on CIA (standardized estimate βstd = 0. 56, p-value = 0. 0004). The effect of autoimmune-induced response on CIA was indirect through alpha-interferon pathway, assessed by expression levels of 5 alpha-interferon-stimulated genes ADAR, ISG 15, IFIT 1, Mx 1 and OAS 1 (effect of autoimmune response on alpha-interferon: βstd = 0. 36, p-value = 0. 0401; effect of alpha-interferon on CIA: βstd = 0. 39, p-value = 0. 0044). There was no direct effect of autoimmune-induced response on CIA (p-value = 0. 3169). Microbial translocation as measured by 16 SrDNA and sCD 14 in plasma was not associated with CIA. Results were consistent in 142 patients in whom cytomegalovirus and <b>auto-immunity</b> responses were measured by Quantiferon and anti-nuclear antibodies, respectively.
