5|$|Paracetamol poisoning, {{also known}} as {{acetaminophen}} poisoning, is caused by excessive use of the medication paracetamol (acetaminophen). Most people have few or non-specific symptoms in the first 24hours following overdose. This may include feeling tired, abdominal pain, or nausea. This is typically followed {{by a couple of}} days without any symptoms after which yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, and confusion occurs. Additional complications may include kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, and lactic acidosis. If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks.</b> Without treatment some cases will resolve while others will result in death.|$|E

The wings of juvenile birds develop rapidly, and it only takes <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> for them to become proficient at flying.

5|$|After {{returning}} to Ayabe, Ueshiba began a regimen of spiritual training, regularly retreating {{to the mountains}} or performing misogi in the Nachi Falls. As his prowess as a martial artist increased, his fame began to spread. He was challenged by many established martial artists, some of whom later became his students after being defeated by him. In the autumn of 1925 {{he was asked to}} give a demonstration of his art in Tokyo, at the behest of Admiral Isamu Takeshita; one of the spectators was Yamamoto Gonnohyōe, who requested that Ueshiba stay in the capital to instruct the Imperial Guard in his martial art. After <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks,</b> however, Ueshiba took issue with several government officials who voiced concerns about his connections to Deguchi; he cancelled the training and returned to Ayabe.|$|E
5|$|After {{weeks of}} secret {{negotiations}} between merchants and protest leaders, an agreement was finally reached {{during the first}} week of May. According to the agreement, small, selected groups of African Americans would order food at the downtown lunch counters on a day known in advance to the merchants. The merchants would prepare their employees for the event and instruct them to serve the customers without trouble. This arrangement would continue in a controlled manner for <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> and then all controls would be taken off, at which point the merchants and protest leaders would reconvene to evaluate the results. Also as part of the agreement, the media was to be informed of the settlement and requested to provide only accurate, non-sensational coverage.|$|E
5|$|Digging for Fire {{was based}} on a real {{incident}} in which Jake Johnson and his wife dug up a bone and a gun in the garden of a house they had rented. Over <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks,</b> he and a group of his friends dug up various objects before deciding to bury them again. Johnson described the experience to Joe Swanberg about three years later and they decided to make a film about it. They wrote a two-and-a-half–page outline that summarized the plot but included no dialogue or detailed character descriptions. Swanberg wanted the actors to improvise the details of each scene and allowed them to make choices about their characters: for instance, Orlando Bloom decided that his character would ride a motorcycle, Chris Messina suggested that his character go swimming naked, and Brie Larson persuaded Johnson and Swanberg that her character would not be sexually attracted to Tim.|$|E

5|$|Humans must consume {{vitamins}} periodically {{but with}} differing schedules, to avoid deficiency. The body's stores for different vitamins vary widely; vitamins A, D, and B12 {{are stored in}} significant amounts, mainly in the liver, and an adult's diet may be deficient in vitamins A and D for many months and B12 in some cases for years, before developing a deficiency condition. However, vitamin B3 (niacin and niacinamide) is not stored in significant amounts, so stores may last only <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks.</b> For vitamin C, the first symptoms of scurvy in experimental studies of complete vitamin C deprivation in humans have varied widely, from a month to more than six months, depending on previous dietary history that determined body stores.|$|E
5|$|In 1860 Berkeley and Curtis {{described}} the species Agaricus cyanophos from material also {{collected from the}} Bonin Islands. This material was found near the location that the original specimens of M.chlorophos were found, but <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> later. Japanese mycologists Seiya Ito and Sanshi Imai studied these collections in the late 1930s, and concluded that Agaricus cyanophos was the same species as M.chlorophos, despite differences in cap shape, gill attachment, {{and the color of}} emitted light. Desjardin and colleagues agreed with this determination after examining the type material of both taxa. M.chlorophos is classified in the section Exornatae of the genus Mycena. Other luminescent species in this section are M.discobasis and M.marginata. Some authors have considered M.illuminans to be synonymous with M.chlorophos due to their morphological similarity, but molecular analysis has shown that they are distinct species.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{dendrochronology}} of wood {{samples from}} Chetro Ketl provided information on species selected, season of cutting, wood modification and use, {{as well as}} an estimate of the number of trees required to build the great house. Trees were harvested for construction at Chetro Ketl annually, which contrasts with the sporadic patterns found at other sites in the canyon. Whereas a late summer and early fall harvesting time has been documented at other Chacoan sites, the tree felling for Chetro Ketl was undertaken primarily during the spring and early summer. This may indicate that enough in-house labor was available during the farming season, or that specialized groups of Chacoans were dedicated to tree felling irrespective of the agriculture cycle, when most others were busy with field preparation and planting. One particularly well sampled room suggests that wood was cut during the relatively short span of <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> per season.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} ocular protothecosis in dog {{associated to}} soft stool and haematochezia. Methods: A 6 -year-old, spayed female, Rhodesian ridgeback dog {{was referred to}} the University of Camerino, Veterinary Teaching Hospital, because of haematochezia associated to soft stool and disorientation. Physical examination showed diffuse lymphadenopathy. Ophthalmological examination in the anterior segment revealed lack of menace response and lack of direct PLR in the right eye. Fundic examination showed bullous retina detachment in the right eye, confirmed by ocular ultrasonography; the left eye was normal. Lymphoma was excluded by cytofluorimetry. Symptomatic therapy was performed for <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>week,</b> in addition with itraconazole for 30 days for algal infection. Because unresponsive to therapy and clinically worse, dog’s euthanasia was performed at the owner’s request. Results: In smears of lymph -node, rectal mucosa and vitreous fluid from the right eye Prototheca spp. organisms were detected. Necropsy revealed the presence of Prototheca organisms in liver, spleen and kidneys. Prototheca was also histologically detectable in the right eye along with severe granulomatous infiltration of subretinal space. Conclusion: Protothecosis is an uncommon intestinal disease in dogs in Italy. To the authors knowledge {{this is the first}} report of ocular Protothecosis in Rhodesian ridgeback dog with monolateral eye vision loss and haematochezia associated to soft stool.

García, however, resigned from his position on 29 September 2014 for health reasons, having been admitted to hospital with chest pains <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> prior. Billy McKinlay, who had only been appointed first team coach on 26 September 2014, was appointed as his immediate successor on the same day – his first position in management. A week later, McKinlay was released by mutual consent and former Partizan coach Slaviša Jokanović appointed in his place, apparently because the club favoured a head coach with greater experience.|$|E
