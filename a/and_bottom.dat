5|$|As {{the team}} {{changed its name}} from the Winia to the Halla the uniforms had minor changes made to them. The logo changed names and the uniforms had colored {{shoulders}} removed from them. The current home jerseys feature a solid blue background with yellow stripes on the cuffs <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> of the body {{as well as a number}} of blue rough shapes behind the gold trim as well as sponsor logos on the shoulders. The away jerseys feature a solid white background with dark blue striped borders on the cuffs <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> of the body, it also contains the same rough blue shapes behind the trim. The Halla put the first name of Korean players on the jerseys to avoid confusion as several players share the same family name.|$|E

5|$|Plantar {{fasciitis}} is {{a disorder}} {{that results in}} pain in the heel <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> of the foot. The pain is usually most severe with the first steps {{of the day or}} following a period of rest. Pain is also frequently brought on by bending the foot and toes up towards the shin and may be worsened by a tight Achilles tendon. The condition typically comes on slowly. In about a third of people both legs are affected.|$|E

5|$|The {{esophagus}} {{is surrounded}} {{at the top}} <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> by two muscular rings, known respectively as the upper esophageal sphincter and the lower esophageal sphincter. These sphincters act to close the esophagus when food is not being swallowed. The esophageal sphincters are functional but not anatomical, meaning that they act as sphincters but do not have distinct thickenings like other sphincters.|$|E
5|$|The viper dogfish has no {{economic}} value. It is very infrequently caught in commercial purse seines <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> trawls targeting other species, though what effect, if any, fishing has on its population is unknown. As a result, the IUCN has listed it under Data Deficient.|$|E

The banners at the top <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> of the logo are inspired by the state flag of North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|A 1920s {{adaptation}} {{created by}} the Stempel Type Foundry and released for hot metal typesetting by Linotype, that has remained popular. It is sharp, somewhat angular design with a crisp hook rather than a teardrop at top left of the 'a'. Stempel Garamond has relatively short descenders, allowing it to be particularly tightly linespaced. An unusual feature is the digit 0, which has reversed contrast, with the thickest points of {{the number on the}} top <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> of the digit to make it more distinguishable from a 'o'. The Klingspor Museum credits it to Stempel's head of typeface development Dr. Rudolf Wolf.|$|E

Or rather, it might have been taken for a general congress of old legitimate moveables, where every kind and country had a representative. No two chairs were alike: such high backs and low backs, <b>and</b> leather <b>bottoms</b> <b>and</b> worsted <b>bottoms,</b> <b>and</b> straw <b>bottoms,</b> <b>and</b> no bottoms; and cracked marble tables with curiously carved legs, holding balls in their claws, as though they were going to play at ninepins.|$|R

5|$|According to {{the initial}} description, the eye socket of Euchambersia is rather small. The {{branches}} of the postorbital and jugal that usually surround the back <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> of the eye socket in therocephalians appear to be either very reduced or absent entirely. Meanwhile, {{the top of the}} eye socket is formed by the prefrontal, and the frontal is also small. The skull does not bear a pineal foramen. Like Whaitsia, the pterygoid and palatine of the palate are not separated from the transpalatine, further {{to the side of the}} jaw, by any sort of opening.|$|E
5|$|All {{described}} {{specimens of}} Sinosauropteryx preserve integumentary structures (filaments {{arising from the}} skin) which most palaeontologists interpret as very primitive type of feathers. These short, down-like filaments are preserved along the back half of the skull, the arms, neck, back, and top <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> of the tail. Additional patches of feathers have been identified {{on the sides of}} the body, and palaeontologists Chen, Dong and Zheng proposed that the density of the feathers on the back and the randomness of the patches elsewhere on the body indicated the animals would have been fully feathered in life, with the ventral feathers having been removed by decomposition.|$|E
5|$|During the season, {{the team}} scored 90 goals {{at an average}} of four goals per game, beat Walsall Town Swifts 12–0 to set a club record League victory which, , still stands, {{remained}} undefeated on their own ground throughout the season, and won the last nine matches of the League season to take the Second Division title at their first attempt. Promotion to the First Division was not automatic, even for the champions, but depended on the results of test matches between the top three Second Division <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> three First Division teams. Small Heath lost to Newton Heath, the 16th-placed First Division team, after a replay, so were not promoted, although the teams placed second and third were.|$|E

5|$|Falls can {{be avoided}} by {{installing}} grab bars in bathrooms and handrails on stairways; removing tripping hazards such as throw rugs; or installing window guards and safety gates at the top <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> of stairs around young children. Playgrounds with shock-absorbing surfaces such as mulch or sand also prevent head injuries. Child abuse prevention is another tactic; programs exist to prevent shaken baby syndrome by educating {{about the dangers of}} shaking children. Gun safety, including keeping guns unloaded and locked, is another preventative measure. Studies on the effect of laws that aim to control access to guns in the United States have been insufficient to determine their effectiveness preventing number of deaths or injuries.|$|E
5|$|Families {{throughout}} Han China made ritual sacrifices {{of animals}} and food to deities, spirits, and ancestors at temples and shrines, {{in the belief that}} these items could be utilized by those in the spiritual realm. It was thought that each person had a two-part soul: the spirit-soul (hun 魂) which journeyed to the afterlife paradise of immortals (xian), and the body-soul (po 魄) which remained in its grave or tomb on earth and was only reunited with the spirit-soul through a ritual ceremony. These tombs were commonly adorned with uniquely decorated hollow clay tiles that function also as a doorjamb to the tomb. Otherwise known as tomb tiles, these artifacts feature holes in the top <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> of the tile allowing it to pivot. Similar tiles have been found in the Chengdu area of Sichuan province in south-central China.|$|E
5|$|Feeding {{mainly on}} bony fishes, the viper dogfish captures prey by {{protruding}} its jaws and impaling them with its teeth. Its impressive gape {{allows it to}} swallow relatively large fish whole. The skeletal and muscular structure of its head shows unique features that support this feeding mechanism, which is unlike that of other dogfish sharks. This shark gives birth to live young, which are nourished by yolk during gestation; the litter size is probably fewer than 26 pups. Small numbers of viper dogfish are caught incidentally in purse seines <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> trawls. The IUCN presently lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of this species.|$|E
