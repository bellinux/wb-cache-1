5|$|In March 1866, a {{month after}} the fall, Eddy and her husband (then married for 13 years) moved into an unfurnished room in Lynn. At some point her husband left and Eddy was evicted, unable to pay the $1.50 weekly rent. He appears to have {{returned}} briefly—they moved to a boarding house in July, and in August he paid Dr. Cushing's bill from the fall—but the marriage was over. He sent her $200 <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time, and they divorced in 1873.|$|E
5|$|The Mayo Clinic {{noted that}} it had been paying the taxes while the case was pending in the courts, so the 15-page opinion would not force them to pay back taxes. In March 2010, while the case was pending before the Supreme Court, the Treasury {{announced}} that it would not contest refund claims for taxes paid prior to the April 2005 regulation. It would however assess taxes on salaries paid after that date, which would cost residency programs a total of approximately $700 million annually, or $3,100 <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> resident earning $50,000 a year (and equivalent amount for the resident's employer).|$|E
5|$|Tommy Brockless (Anthony Lewis) {{is a young}} World War I soldier, shell-shocked {{from his}} {{experiences}} in the trenches. In 1918, Torchwood agents Gerald Carter and Harriet Derbyshire (Roderic Culver and Siobhan Hewlett) take Tommy from the St Teilo's military hospital in Cardiff {{to be kept in}} cryonic storage. They leave instructions for future Torchwood members that Tommy will one day be key to saving the world.

5|$|The {{numbers of}} women with SCI giving birth and having healthy babies are increasing. Around a half to two-thirds of women with SCI report {{they might want to}} have children, and 14–20% do get {{pregnant}} at least once. Although female fertility is not usually permanently reduced by SCI, there is a stress response that can happen immediately post-injury that alters levels of fertility-related hormones in the body. In about half of women, menstruation stops after the injury but then returns within an average of five months—it returns within <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> large majority. After menstruation returns, women with SCI become pregnant at a rate close to that {{of the rest of the}} population.|$|E

25|$|In 1807, {{a skilled}} worker, {{such as a}} jeweler, perfumer, tailor or {{furniture}} maker, could earn 4-6 francs a day; a baker earned 8-12 francs a week; a stonemason earned 2-4 francs a day; an unskilled worker, such as construction laborer, earned 1.50 to 2.5 francs a day. Much of the work was seasonal; most construction work stopped during the winter. Women's salaries were lower; a worker in a tobacco factory earned one franc a day, while women making embroidery or seamstresses earned 50-60 centimes a day, government salaries in 1800 were fixed {{on a scale of}} 8000 francs <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> chief of a division of a Ministry down to 2500 francs <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> messenger.|$|E

25|$|There are {{multiple}} public transportation options available, including bus, rail, air and ferry service. NJ Transit provides bus service {{to and from}} the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan on the 131, 135 and 139 routes; on the 64 and 67 and from both Jersey City and Newark. The Matawan train station is a heavily used train station on NJ Transit's North Jersey Coast Line, providing service to New York Pennsylvania Station via Secaucus Junction, with a transfer available for trains to Newark Liberty International Airport. However, both options provide significant problems in terms of lack of available parking, which may require waiting periods of more than <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> permit and private parking options are very expensive.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{argue that}} {{whatever}} {{the merits of the}} system for electing the National Assembly, that body is itself a facade for the reality of PCC rule in Cuba. The Assembly meets only twice <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few days which is the basis of these beliefs. The 31-member Council of State, in theory elected by the Assembly but hypothetically in practice appointed by the PCC, wields effective state power, and the PCC Politburo is assumed to be the ultimate political authority. Although the Assembly has eight standing committees, they do not exercise any effective authority over legislation. During its biannual plenums, the Assembly is said to play a passive role as audience for various government speakers. Once the Council of State's legislative proposals have been presented, they are summarily ratified by unanimous or near unanimous vote of the Assembly.|$|E
