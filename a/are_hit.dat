5|$|October 11, 1888– The Outer Banks <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> by a {{tropical}} storm.|$|E
5|$|At this point, a Selenite (an insectoid alien {{inhabitant}} of the Moon, {{named after}} one of the Greek moon goddesses, Selene) appears, but it is killed easily by an astronomer, as the creatures explode if they <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> with force. More Selenites appear and it becomes increasingly difficult for the astronomers to destroy them as they are surrounded. The Selenites capture the astronomers and take them to the palace of their king. An astronomer lifts the Selenite King off his throne and throws him to the ground, causing him to explode.|$|E
5|$|Urban sprawl, air {{and water}} pollution, noise, light pollution, {{and a range of}} habitat {{restricted}} by human infrastructure put stress on the park's mammals and other animals, but the most serious immediate threat to them is roadkill. About 50,000 vertebrates a year die on the park's roads when they <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> by a vehicle. The RMD has few roads, but Picture Rocks Road, an east–west commuter highway crossing the TMD, is highly dangerous to wildlife. Attempts in 2002 to convert it to a hiking trail failed after the proposal met with stiff public resistance.|$|E
6000|$|Strether, on his side, did {{justice to}} that plea. [...] "Oh of course I saw she <b>was</b> <b>hit.</b> That she <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>was</b> {{what we were}} busy with; that she <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>was</b> our great affair. But somehow I couldn't {{think of her as}} down in the dust. And as put there by OUR little Chad!" ...|$|R
5000|$|One-handed backhands should <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> more {{in front}} of the body than the forehand, which allows them to <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> with a deeper hit spot.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{baseball}} <b>was</b> <b>hit,</b> it <b>was</b> considered property of MLB and after it <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>was</b> considered intentionally abandoned property. Under this theory, whoever comes into possession of it {{first is the}} rightful owner.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, while {{orbiting}} the Earth during a routine space mission with his crew, Colonel John Jameson and his ship <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> by a meteor shower. John struggles {{to get the}} ship back safely on Earth but eventually succeeds in landing it at Cape Canaveral. The next day, Jonah learns that the Globes cover story on the Goblin's rampage—featuring Peter's photos—is outselling the Bugles story on John's heroic space journey. An infuriated Jameson decides {{to meet with the}} public's demand by publishing a new cover story questioning if Spider-Man is a hero or a menace. Meanwhile, John is interviewed at the shuttle hangar when he spots a mysterious, vibrating black goo {{on the bottom of the}} shuttle.|$|E
5|$|The player takes {{control of}} the Gunhed Star Fighter through nine {{vertically}} scrolling areas. The player's mission is to destroy the Dark Squadron and its eight enemy Super Weapons. Every area contains one or more bosses, all of which must be destroyed before continuing in the game. Players lose a life if they <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> by an enemy or projectile, with the game continuing at a previously–crossed checkpoint, unless they grab a flashing orb which destroys all on-screen enemies and allows them to continue {{at the point where}} their previous ship was destroyed (represented by the icon illustrating the remaining number of ships turning gold). The game ends when all lives have been lost, but the game awards 1-ups when the player scores a particular number of points. The game provides four continues in which players can restart the game at that level in which their previous game ended provided the system is not turned off.|$|E
5|$|Australian ravens die {{most often}} by being shot or poisoned—generally by farmers. Despite their fondness for roadkill, fewer ravens <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> by {{vehicles}} than Australian magpies. Research in the 1950s and 60s showed that 64% of Australian ravens perished {{in their first}} year of life. Immature birds are most at risk of dying as {{they are more likely to}} come into conflict with farmers. The Australian Raven is a peaceful bird, showing no aggression toward humans or other birds without reason. However, the Australian raven is frequently blamed for the loss of young lambs. Scientific observation in the country's southeast showed that the killing of healthy lambs was rare, but that sick animals were predisposed to being attacked. Australian ravens mostly eat faeces (often from the lamb's anus), afterbirth or stillborn lambs. Newborn lamb faeces is nutritious, containing around 21–44% protein, 9–37% fat and 10–30% carbohydrate. It has the consistency of treacle and often sticks to the lamb's hindquarters or tail. The raven bites a sleeping lamb's tail, holding on and walking behind it when it wakes up. A healthy lamb would respond by running away or butting the bird, but a sick one might not respond and be attacked further as it alerts the bird that it is vulnerable. Wounded lambs can also succumb to Clostridium infection as these bacteria are present on raven bills. Ravens bring some benefits to agricultural areas as they clean away carrion and eat insects that are potentially damaging to crops. In areas of Western Australia, the species is classified as a Declared Pest of Agriculture under the provisions of the Agriculture and Related Resources Protection Act 1976, meaning that shooting on private land in rural areas is legal, although should be considered only after other options have been exhausted.|$|E
50|$|The fiery Jennings {{was also}} {{known as one of}} the most fearless players of his time, {{allowing}} himself to <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> by pitches more than any other player. In one game, he <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> by a pitch three times. In 1896, he <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> by pitches 51 times—a Major League record that still stands. In just five seasons with the Orioles from 1894 to 1898, Jennings <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> by pitches an unprecedented 202 times. During one game, Jennings <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> in the head by a pitch from Amos Rusie in the 3rd inning, but managed to finish the game. As soon as the game ended, Jennings collapsed and was unconscious for three days.|$|R
5000|$|Housemates can <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> (figuratively) with a {{poisonous}} arrow. Big Brother will {{decide to do}} something to the housemate who <b>was</b> <b>hit.</b> For instance, in the Week 1, Ema <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> with {{a poisonous}} arrow by Duško (who was evicted from the main house to the Dumps). Big Brother then decided to take away all the personal stuff from Ema. In Week 2, Bojana <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> by an arrow (which was shot by Soraja) and had to do all of the house chores by herself.|$|R
50|$|The bostekoa (worth five points) must <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> {{first as}} it determines the {{direction}} of play. If the board <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> but no pin, six points are awarded.|$|R
5|$|Each level {{contains}} various {{obstacles and}} enemies {{that the players}} must deal with. Players lose a segment from their snake if they <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> by an enemy, and they lose a life if their snake runs out of segments. Players can also lose a life if their snakes fall too far, the timer runs out, their snakes touch a sharp object, or if they are squashed by an object from above. Also, if they remain in some bodies of water for too long, a shark will attack. The game ends if players lose all their lives, but they have several continues {{in which they can}} restart the game from where they left off. Players can defeat enemies by hitting them with their tongues or by jumping on them. They can collect various items to help them along during gameplay, such as items that extend the length of the snakes' tongues, extra lives and continues, time bonuses, invisibility diamonds, and items that speed up or reverse the direction of the snakes. Located throughout the game are lids (in the shape of manhole covers) in which players can open to uncover Nibbly Pibbleys, items and extra lives, entrances to bonus levels, and sometimes enemies. Also located in the game are hidden warps which allow players to skip several levels and restart at a later point in the game.|$|E
5|$|Homer, {{who still}} wants to party, rents an airboat and forces his family to come with him. He races through a swamp, accidentally killing the state's most famous {{resident}} and reptile – an alligator named Captain Jack, whom Marge, Maggie, Lisa, and Bart saw on a tour earlier while Homer made a fool of himself at the concert. A sheriff quickly arrives {{on the scene and}} despite the fact that Homer is the sole guilty culprit, the entire family is charged for killing the alligator. The family members flee from the sheriff and during a car chase they <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> by a train that pushes their car on the rail for several miles. When the Simpsons get off of the rail, they escape to a restaurant where they are given employment. They live in a nearby trailer and progressively turn into hillbillies. The sheriff eventually tracks them down and kidnaps them while they are sleeping. For their crimes (and Homer's foolish attempt at defending himself in court), the family is put into forced labor. One night when they are working at a party held by a judge in front of the capitol, tending to the guests (and failing to escape), Captain Jack strolls out of the capitol's doors. It turns out that he was never dead but rather knocked out. The family is acquitted, though they are banned from entering the state of Florida again (and several other states, excluding Arizona and North Dakota).|$|E
5|$|Immortal Throne {{features}} multiple additions and alterations over Titan Quest. The main addition {{is a new}} Mastery titled Dream Mastery: {{available to}} new players {{from the start of}} the main campaign, it is a magic-focused skill that relies on illusion and stasis effects to disrupt enemy groups. Among the abilities available are putting nearby enemies to sleep until they <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> by a weapon strike, turning enemies on each other, and effects which make enemies take damage when they strike the player or faster health and energy recovery. In addition to extra quests, new items and equipment are included. An additional item slot for the player character is reserved for Artifacts, charms crafted for the player by Enchanters after the player discovers enough Arcane Formulae after defeating enemies. Artifacts are divided into three levels (Lesser, Greater and Divine), which grant a variety of status effects depending on their level. A separate type of item are Scrolls, expendable items that produce powerful effects and can be equipped in a similar fashion to healing potions. Additional sellers and storage Caravans are included in between towns. Multiplayer functions return from the original game, while adding refinements such as the ability to automatically join parties and engage in player-versus-player matches.|$|E
50|$|Of {{the four}} bodyguards {{in the rear}} Fiat car, two were {{slightly}} injured while the other two <b>were</b> severely <b>hit</b> by shrapnel: Anthony Ruggiero <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> in the eye, while Salvatore La Porta <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> {{in the head and}} other parts of his body.|$|R
5000|$|... 1225: Bailey {{launched}} five torpedoes at 9500 yd. All missed. Bailey <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> twice by 8-inch {{shells and}} came to a stop with five dead. Coghlan <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> once.|$|R
50|$|Jachigi is a {{game where}} a long stick and two short sticks <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> and caught. First, a {{circular}} hole is dug on the ground, and a circle is drawn on the outside. After placing a short stick around {{the outside of the}} hole, it <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> with the long stick, and the rebounding stick (the short one that <b>was</b> just <b>hit),</b> <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> again with the long stick in mid-air, sending it flying far away.|$|R
25|$|Usually, most fielders {{are placed}} on the off side. This is because most bowlers tend to {{concentrate}} the line of their deliveries on or outside the off stump, so most shots <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> into the off side.|$|E
25|$|Raise the Dead: For 30 seconds {{each set}} of 4 hits to a bumper in the {{graveyard}} adds 3 million points to the player's end-of-ball bonus. The round ends early if all five bumpers <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> 4 times each.|$|E
25|$|Shots are {{exchanged}} between Republicans and Free State {{troops at}} the cemetery in Dundalk at the interment of the bodies of six Anti-Treaty fighters executed in January 1923. Several people <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> and one man dies of his wounds.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is not dead," [...] Chris said. [...] "He <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> {{in the arm}} or shoulder, but he knew if {{he moved}} he would <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> again to a certainty." ...|$|R
5000|$|On April 27, 2017, Hample caught {{two home}} runs during the same game at Progressive Field. One <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> off the bat of Marwin González and another <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> by Abraham Almonte.|$|R
50|$|Brady Anderson was {{the first}} player to <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> by a pitch two times in the same inning in an American League game. On April 25, 2014, Brandon Moss became the second when he <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> twice {{in the top of the}} 9th inning by Houston Astros pitchers. Five players have <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by a pitch twice in the same inning in the National League.|$|R
25|$|Motor vehicle accidents: State Farm Insurance {{estimates}} {{that more than}} 10,000 deer in Connecticut <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> by cars each year. But the state Department of Environmental Protection estimates only 3,000 deer-motor vehicle accidents occur annually. State policy is to bury deer carcases {{by the side of}} the road where they were hit.|$|E
25|$|Most nuclear fuels contain heavy fissile {{elements}} {{that are capable of}} nuclear fission, such as uranium-235 or plutonium-239. When the unstable nuclei of these atoms <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> by a slow-moving neutron, they split, creating two daughter nuclei and two or three more neutrons. These neutrons then go on to split more nuclei. This creates a self-sustaining chain reaction that is controlled in a nuclear reactor, or uncontrolled in a nuclear weapon.|$|E
25|$|There is {{an overall}} underpricing of formal water and {{sanitation}} services in Sub-Saharan Africa. A first consequence is an insufficient cost recovery, leading to dependency on foreign aid and governmental support, and to insufficient investments. Second, underpricing is socially unfair. Since the poorest social groups are less connected to water networks and sewerage, they need to turn to alternatives, and they pay in some cases a multiple of the formal tariff. Hence, the poorest <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> twice: they have less access to improved water supply and sanitation, {{and they need to}} pay more.|$|E
5000|$|... where H <b>is</b> <b>hits,</b> BB <b>is</b> base on balls, CS {{is caught}} stealing, HBP <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> by pitch, GIDP is {{grounded}} into double play, TB is total bases, IBB is intentional base on balls, SH <b>is</b> sacrifice <b>hit,</b> SF <b>is</b> sacrifice fly, SB is stolen base, and AB is at bats.|$|R
25|$|Mizuki: This shot <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> as a volley. Unlike {{a normal}} volley, the Mizuki shot <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> {{with the other}} side of the racket by turning the wrist which deceives the {{direction}} of the ball.|$|R
50|$|Tehran sits on {{two major}} fault lines, {{and it has}} <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by over 1000 big and small {{earthquake}}s; although, the region has not <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by a severe earthquake in the last 150 years.|$|R
25|$|Killer or German {{skittles}}: A {{game for}} any number of people. Each starts with 3 lives. Each bowls only one ball at a time. The first bowls at a full frame and the skittles are not stuck up until all nine <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> down. Each time a player fails to hit a single pin (but they can hit as many as they like), he or she loses a life. The winner is the last one left with a life intact. Usually played for money, e.g. £1 or 50p a game each player - the winner takes the pot. Found in the Somerset and Bristol areas.|$|E
25|$|Right and Left is a 1909 oil {{on canvas}} {{painting}} by the American artist Winslow Homer. It depicts a pair of common goldeneye ducks at the moment they <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> by a hunter's shotgun blast {{as they attempt to}} take flight. Completed less than two years before his death, it was Homer's last great painting, and {{has been the subject of}} a variety of interpretations regarding its origin, composition and meaning. As with his other late masterworks, it represents a return to the sporting and hunting subjects of Homer's earlier years, and was to be his final engagement with the theme. Its design recalls that of Japanese art, and the composition resembles that of a colored engraving by John James Audubon.|$|E
25|$|Sonic 3D Blast {{is played}} from an {{isometric}} viewpoint in a 2D environment and uses pre-rendered 3D sprites, displaying pseudo-3D graphics. Sonic must find and destroy robots located around the zones, {{and bring the}} flickies inside them to large rings. Every zone has three acts: two standard levels and a boss fight against Robotnik, without any flicky-collecting involved. Once the player collects all five flickies from each section of an act, Sonic is either further advanced into the act, or taken to the next act. If Sonic or the following flickies <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> by an obstacle or enemy, the flickies will scatter. Each individual flicky's colour determines its behaviour. Blue and pink/orange flickies {{make an effort to}} find Sonic, while green and red flickies wander off at random; the latter even jumping about, making them harder to re-collect.|$|E
5000|$|Mizuki: This shot <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> as a volley. Unlike {{a normal}} volley, the Mizuki shot <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> {{with the other}} side of the racket by turning the wrist which deceives the {{direction}} of the ball.|$|R
