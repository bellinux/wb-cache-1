25|$|As John Curtis let {{his first}} pitch go, Munson broke for the plate. Michael tried to bunt, and missed. With Munson coming, the scrawny Yankees shortstop tried {{to step in}} Fisk's way, but Fisk elbowed {{him out of the}} way and braced for Munson, who crashed into him <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> Fisk held onto the ball, but Munson tried to lie on top of him to allow Felipe Alou to keep {{rounding}} the bases.|$|E
25|$|The team {{suffered}} a serious blow when center fielder Adam Eaton, {{acquired in the}} off-season in a trade with the Chicago White Sox, stepped awkwardly on first base beating out an infield single {{in the ninth inning}} at Nationals Park against the Mets on April 28. Eaton had to be carried off the field, and an MRI showed he had torn his anterior cruciate ligament and knee meniscus and sprained his ankle. The injuries were expected to rule him out for the season, although Eaton said he would work <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> to return in time for the playoffs. The Nationals called up outfielder Rafael Bautista to replace Eaton on the active roster.|$|E
25|$|After the Schism, around {{half of all}} the mutants on Utopia {{accompany}} Wolverine to Westchester {{to be a part of}} the new school. He appoints {{himself as}} the headmaster, Kitty Pryde as the co-headmistress, Hank McCoy as the vice-principal, and various other characters such as Rogue, Cannonball, Iceman, Rachel Grey, and Gambit are appointed as the school's staff. Toad is appointed as a janitor. The first issue focuses on the state education board visiting to approve of their school application. As Logan and Kitty give the delegation a tour, Kade Kilgore shows up and tells Logan that he is the one who caused the Schism and he will destroy all that Logan has worked to build up. Wolverine founded the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning, spending all the fortune that he had amassed over the years upon it. On its first day it was assaulted by the new Hellfire Club, who had been a major force in causing the Schism of the X-Men. Wolverine made it clear that he didn't want to lose any of the kids and fought <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> against the Frankenstein Monsters whom Iceman defeated by making Ice clones of himself. Then, they were attacked by the Hellfire Club, who were in possession of a spawn of the original Krakoa.|$|E

500|$|In the 200-meter {{butterfly}} semi-finals, Tarwater {{turned in}} the second-fastest time behind Bobby Bollier as Phelps conserved energy. In the finals the next day, Tarwater, knowing he was facing several strong finishers, decided to go out <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> and try to build a big enough lead to hold on. Tarwater led {{the field for the}} first 100 meters. [...] Phelps passed him in the third 50-meter stretch, but Tarwater held off {{the rest of the field}} until the final 25 meters when both Bollier and Tyler Clary surged ahead, dropping Tarwater to fourth. His split on the final 50 meters was three seconds slower than his third 50, and two seconds slower than his final lap in 2008. A couple days later, Tarwater advanced to the 100-meter butterfly final, but finished fifth. [...] Afterwards, he called it [...] "the last race I'll ever swim." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{sinking of}} the RMS Lusitania in 1915 created a wave of anti-German sentiment, and Gruban worried that he would find it {{difficult}} to find government work because of his nationality and thick German accent. He again contacted Booth, who again claimed to be friends with David Lloyd George and his secretary, Christopher Addison, and said that if Gruban put Booth on the Board of Directors he could [...] "do with the Ministry of Munitions what I like". Gruban immediately made Booth the chairman of his company, and over 3 months took £400 on expenses. He then claimed that this was not enough money for the work he did, and he should get a secret payment of 10% of the value of a contract known as the [...] "Birmingham Contract". The contract was worth £6,000, and Booth wrote a memo saying that he should have £580 or £600. Gruban refused, and Booth threw the note in the wastepaper basket. From that point onwards Booth worked <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> to undermine Gruban's position, while outwardly appearing to be his friend.|$|E
500|$|The next {{race was}} the Breeders' Cup Classic on November 1. Because many leading older horses retired in 2014, {{most of the}} main contenders for the 2014 Classic were the three year olds: in {{addition}} to California Chrome, former foes Bayern, Candy Boy and Tonalist entered. His chief rival {{was considered to be}} the then-undefeated American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt, Shared Belief, a gelding who missed the Triple Crown series due to hoof problems; the two had never faced each other. California Chrome was 4-1 on the morning line, second favorite to Shared Belief. In the race, Bayern bumped into Shared Belief at the start, then took the lead {{for the duration of the}} race. California Chrome was clear of traffic, maintained third place for most of the race, was closing at the end, and finished a very close third, only a neck behind winner Bayern, who won by a nose over second-place finisher Toast of New York. Shared Belief was fourth. Post race analysis noted that California Chrome stayed on the outside throughout the race, and actually ran 44 feet farther than the winner. [...] Sherman spoke in positive terms of the horse's finish, stating, [...] "My horse ran his eyeballs out. He was right there, right down to the money. I thought it was a great effort. He came back strong." [...] Espinoza was less enthusiastic: [...] "On the backstretch I thought I had a chance to win... The last sixteenth [...] was digging <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> but getting just a little tired. I wish he had one more race. It was a little too much for him today." [...] Coburn visited the colt the following day and stated, [...] "He was full of himself. I think he thought he won. And if the race had been just a little bit longer, I believe he would have." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yah!" [...] {{said the}} mayor, and pulled <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> dared: {{but the more}} he pulled, the more the lobster pinched, till {{he was forced to}} be quiet.|$|R

6000|$|That {{going to}} school was not <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had fancied was known at the engine-house when the amateur {{returned}} shortly after nine o'clock, for then he said {{with an air of}} relief: ...|$|R
2500|$|Teachers {{also showed}} some sympathy for McInerney. [...] "We failed Brandon," [...] a teacher said. [...] "We didn't know the {{bullying}} {{was coming from}} the other side—Larry was pushing <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> because he liked the attention." [...] Hundreds of children from the school have signed a petition requesting that McInerney be tried as a juvenile.|$|E

60|$|Of course, it {{was only}} a {{friendly}} affair, and none of the boys rowed <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> would have done in a regular contest. Nevertheless, each craft made good progress over the sparkling waters of the lake.|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, Moss {{was strong}} {{right from the}} start, as was Hawthorn. Hawthorn would push his Jaguar D-Type <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had when he won at Le Mans. He would set the fastest lap of the race, {{averaging}} a speed of nearly 95 mph.|$|R
