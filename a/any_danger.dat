5|$|From the mid-1870s Busch's {{illustrations}} {{were printed}} using zincography. With this technique {{there was no}} longer <b>any</b> <b>danger</b> that a wood engraver could change the character of his drawings. The originals were photographed and transferred onto a photosensitive zinc plate. This process allowed for the application of a clear, free pen-drawn ink line, and was a much faster printing method. Busch's use of zincography began with Mr. and Mrs. Knopp.|$|E
5|$|Adders are {{not usually}} aggressive, tending to be rather timid and biting only when cornered or alarmed. People are {{generally}} bitten only after stepping on them or attempting to pick them up. They will usually disappear into the undergrowth at a hint of <b>any</b> <b>danger,</b> but will return once all is quiet, often to the same spot. Occasionally, individual snakes will reveal their presence with a loud and sustained hissing, hoping to warn off potential aggressors. Often, these {{turn out to be}} pregnant females. When the adder is threatened, the front part of the body is drawn into an S-shape to prepare for a strike.|$|E
5|$|In {{the closing}} days of World War I, the Conference of Ambassadors drew the first {{demarcation}} line between Poland and Lithuania on June 18, 1919. The line satisfied no one, and Polish troops continued to advance {{deeper into the}} Lithuanian-controlled territory. These attacks coincided with {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Versailles on June 28, which eliminated <b>any</b> <b>danger</b> from Germany. Attempting to halt further hostilities, Marshal of France Ferdinand Foch proposed a new line, known as the Foch Line, on July 18, 1919.|$|E

5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, the animal keepers were issued with rifles to deal with any dangerous animals who might escape if the gardens were bombed. A night shift was introduced to watch over the animals 24hours a day. A list of dangerous animals that was drawn up included 13lions, 6tigers, 2leopards, 1cheetah, 2tigons, 3other small cats and several bears. Although the zoo's administrators succeeded in convincing the local authorities that <b>any</b> <b>danger</b> from the animals was minimal, primarily because the perimeter walls were so high, the keepers were replaced in their sharp-shooting role by soldiers who patrolled the grounds armed with tommy guns.|$|E
5|$|The alpine pika can emit three {{different}} vocalizations. The long call is heard during the mating season from only the subspecies O. a. alpina, O. a. changaica, and O. a. nitida. The short call is a harsh, sharp whistle that is easily distinguishable from the short high-pitched whistle {{of the northern}} pika. The alarm call is given out immediately <b>any</b> <b>danger</b> from predators or humans is perceived, and can travel greater distances than the calls of most other pika species.|$|E
5|$|The three wake {{up again}} on the TARDIS, no longer in <b>any</b> <b>danger.</b> The Doctor realises both realities were false since the Dream Lord had no power over {{the real world and}} was a manifestation of his darker side. The three were {{influenced}} by psychic pollen that had fallen in the TARDIS time rotor and heated up, creating the Dream Lord and the false realities. Rory comes to realise that Amy killed herself in the Leadworth reality out of love for him, and the two confess their love for each other. The Doctor sees the Dream Lord smile at him through his reflection.|$|E

50|$|The {{meaning of}} Jinapanjara is 'the armor of the Buddha'. Jinapanjara is the {{combination}} of two words, Jina meaning 'the winner', which is the Buddha, and Panjara meaning 'cage'.

5|$|In response, a 5 September news {{briefing}} at the Pentagon by Press Secretary Geoff Morrell {{stated that}} {{at no time}} was the public in <b>any</b> <b>danger</b> and that military personnel had custody of the weapons at all times. The USAF announced that {{within days of the}} incident, the USAF relieved the Minot munitions squadron commander of duty and eventually disciplined 25 airmen. USAF Major General Doug Raaberg was assigned by General Keys to lead an investigation into the incident. The USAF inventory of nuclear warheads was checked to ensure that all warheads were accounted for. In addition, the DoD announced that a Pentagon-appointed scientific advisory panel, called the Defense Science Board, would study the mishap {{as part of a larger}} review of procedures for handling nuclear weapons. On 28 September, the USAF announced that General Keys was retiring and would be replaced as ACC commander by General John Corley, effective 2 October.|$|E
5|$|Ivanović {{had left}} Vienna in 1840 {{and gone to}} study at the Munich Academy, {{possibly}} owing to Czacki's further generosity. Subsequent statements suggest that Ivanović was inspired to paint The Conquest of Belgrade around this time. Writing in 1873, she recalled how the painting came about: While studying at the Munich Academy, I started to read History of the Serb People. I wanted to paint the brave battle of Mirko on my canvas. With seven of his comrades he succeeded in entering the city at night while the Muslims were celebrating Bajram (Eid al-Fitr) and didn't even think about <b>any</b> <b>danger.</b> Mirko and his comrades killed the guards at the town gate. Their rifle shots were the signal for the others. Ivanović soon travelled to Belgrade, visited the battlesite, conversed {{with some of the}} participants in Belgrade's capture, and examined period clothing and weaponry used in the battle. She created the composition in 1844–45; it was painted in Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|Tatum is paroled and {{the media}} begins hyping the fight. Marge makes Moe promise her that the moment Homer is in <b>any</b> <b>danger,</b> he will throw in the towel. The fight starts and {{it is obvious that}} Homer cannot {{withstand}} Tatum's barrage and is in danger of being knocked out. Homer decides to fight back, but misses completely. As Tatum readies himself to deliver the final blow, Moe flies in using the Fan Man's paramotor and carries Homer away. Outside the arena, Marge thanks Moe for saving Homer and Tatum shows respect for the love Moe showed for Homer. Sweet declares that Moe will always be a loser, but still gives him a check for $100,000. Moe starts up the paramotor and flies off into the night.|$|E

5|$|During {{the course}} of Fraser's novels, Flashman goes from his {{expulsion}} from school into the army. Although he is a coward who tries {{to run away from}} <b>any</b> <b>danger,</b> he is involved in many famous military episodes from the 19th century, often taking actions that cause or affect subsequent events, such as his flatulence affecting the Charge of the Light Brigade, or being the person who probably shot George Armstrong Custer. When circumstances run against him and he is forced to fight, he often does so bravely and capably. Despite his cowardice and his attempts to flee, he becomes a decorated war hero and rises to the rank of brigadier-general. He also meets people who either were notable at the time—such as Benjamin Disraeli and the Duke of Wellington—or who became well-known after Flashman met them—such as Abraham Lincoln. Flashman either has, or tries to have, sex with most of the female characters: {{by the end of the}} ninth book he estimates that he has had sex with 480 women.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in <b>any</b> <b>danger</b> until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that {{in the back of my}} head.|$|E
5|$|Andrei is {{once again}} at the Andronikov Monastery as famine and war grip the country. He no longer paints and never speaks, and keeps Durochka with him as a fellow {{companion}} in silence. Several refugees discuss the problems in their respective home towns, and one man talks in a broken voice of his escape from Vladimir. He is recognised by a younger monk as the long absent Kirill. He has suffered during his {{time away from the}} monastery and begs the father superior to allow him to return. His wish is granted but he is instructed to copy out the holy scriptures fifteen times in penance. A group of Tatars stops at the monastery while travelling through the region, much to the concern of Andrei and Kirill who experienced their brutality first hand. Durochka is too simple minded to remember what the Tatars did and is fascinated by one of the soldier's shining breastplate. The group taunt and play with her, but the soldier takes a liking to her, putting his horned helmet on her head and dressing her as a bride, finally deciding to take her away with him as his eighth, and only Russian, wife. Andrei attempts to stop her from leaving, but she is determined and rides away with the Tatars. Kirill talks to Andrei {{for the first time since}} they both left the monastery, and he assures him that Durochka won't be in <b>any</b> <b>danger,</b> as harming a holy fool is considered bad luck, and she will be let go. Andrei continues his menial work of carrying large hot stones from a fire with tongs to heat water for the monastery, but drops the stone in the snow.|$|E
