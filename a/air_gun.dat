5|$|The {{hijacking}} {{occurred on}} board Braathens SAFE Flight 139 {{en route from}} Trondheim Airport, Værnes to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The aircraft was a Boeing 737–205, named Harald Gille (after Harald IV of Norway) with registration LN-SUG. The day before the hijacking, Huseby graduated from upper secondary school, where he studied health and social work. That evening, he purchased an <b>air</b> <b>gun</b> in Trondheim. The weapon was in his hand luggage when boarding the aircraft at Trondheim Airport, Værnes, {{where there was no}} security control. He selected a seat {{at the rear of the}} aircraft. While airborne, the hijacker showed a female flight attendant the <b>air</b> <b>gun,</b> and asked her to inform the captain that he wanted control over the aircraft, but that otherwise all was to proceed as planned. The flight attendant and later the hijacker used the intercom to communicate with the pilot. The police were informed about the incident via air controllers at 15:05.|$|E
5|$|On 21 June 1985, the 737-200 LN-SUG Harald Gille, with 121 {{passengers}} {{en route}} from Trondheim to Oslo, was hijacked by the 24-year-old Stein Arvid Huseby. He had threatened a flight attendant with an <b>air</b> <b>gun.</b> He demanded to talk to Prime Minister Kåre Willoch and Minister of Justice Mona Røkke and {{a press conference to}} make a political statement. His demands were not met, and he surrendered while the plane was parked in Oslo. This was the first hijacking in Norway.|$|E
5|$|Armed with an <b>air</b> <b>gun,</b> Huseby {{threatened}} a cabin attendant {{and told the}} captain to proceed as planned to Fornebu. He claimed (falsely) to have placed explosives on board. His demands were to make a political statement and talk to Prime Minister Kåre Willoch and Minister of Justice Mona Røkke. The plane landed at 15:30 at Fornebu and was surrounded by the police. After one hour, Huseby released 70 hostages in exchange for having the aircraft being {{moved closer to the}} terminal building. Thirty minutes later, Huseby released the remaining passengers. He drank throughout the incident, and at 17:30, after he consumed the plane's beer supply, he surrendered his weapon in exchange for more beer. The plane was immediately stormed and Huseby arrested.|$|E
5000|$|While {{historical}} <b>air</b> <b>guns</b> {{have been}} made specifically for warfare, modern <b>air</b> <b>guns</b> can also be deadly. In medical literature, modern <b>air</b> <b>guns</b> have been noted {{as the cause of}} death. This has been the case for guns of caliber [...]177 and [...]22 that are within the legal muzzle energy of <b>air</b> <b>guns</b> in the United Kingdom.|$|R
5000|$|In Poland it is {{possible}} to freely acquire <b>air</b> <b>guns</b> with a muzzle energy not exceeding [...] <b>Air</b> <b>guns</b> with muzzle energy over 17 J are considered FAC and must be registered at a local police station no later than 5 days after purchase (a gun licence is not needed). FAC <b>air</b> <b>guns</b> can only be used at the officially licensed shooting ranges. Hunting/shooting animals with <b>air</b> <b>guns</b> is illegal and can lead to prosecution.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Air</b> <b>guns</b> with a muzzle energy over [...] {{require the}} same licence as {{firearms}} and police registration. Such <b>air</b> <b>guns</b> {{can be used}} only at the shooting ranges.|$|R
25|$|During {{her time}} as Hank’s partner, she {{took part in}} {{numerous}} conflicts with villains who included the Porcupine, Egghead and Whirlwind (then known as the Human Top). Though initially without any offensive powers, Janet proves to be resourceful, using her {{ability to communicate with}} insects to fight, as well as using a pin to poke people as means of a weapon. Later, she uses a miniature <b>air</b> <b>gun,</b> the original wasp’s sting.|$|E
25|$|On {{the last}} day of June 1944, she sortied for carrier strikes on the Bonin Islands in support of the {{subsequent}} Mariana Islands assault. Her planes destroyed aircraft on the ground and in the <b>air,</b> <b>gun</b> installations, airfield and enemy shipping. On 4 July, strikes were launched against Iwo Jima, Chichi Jima, and Haha Jima, hitting ground targets, sinking a large cargo vessel in the harbor and setting three smaller ships on fire.|$|E
25|$|Ballard's first dive in a {{submersible}} {{was in the}} Ben Franklin (PX-15) in 1969 off {{the coast}} of Florida during a Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution expedition. In summer 1970, he began a field mapping project of the Gulf of Maine for his doctoral dissertation. It used an <b>air</b> <b>gun</b> that sent sound waves underwater to determine the underlying structure of the ocean floor and the submersible Alvin, which was used to find and recover a sample from the bedrock.|$|E
5000|$|In Germany, <b>air</b> <b>guns</b> {{producing}} a muzzle energy up to 7.5 joule (J) (5.53 ft·lbf) can {{be owned by}} persons {{from the age of}} 18 years and freely acquired provided they bear the [...] "F-in-pentagon" [...] mark" [...] that indicates a muzzle energy not exceeding [...] kinetic energy. Carrying <b>air</b> <b>guns</b> in public necessitates a carry permit (§ 10 Abs. 4 WaffG), extremely rare as such and never granted for <b>air</b> <b>guns.</b> Only the transportation of unloaded and non-accessible <b>air</b> <b>guns</b> (or carrying unloaded during biathlon) is considered a [...] "permissible carry" [...] (§ 12 Abs. 3 Nr. 2, Nr. 3 WaffG).|$|R
50|$|New York City has a {{restrictive}} {{municipal ordinance}} regulating <b>air</b> <b>guns.</b> <b>Air</b> <b>guns</b> were previously banned in San Francisco, but a state preemption statute {{struck down the}} ban, and the San Francisco District Attorney declared them legal as long as in compliance with state law.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the federal}} {{government}} does not normally regulate <b>air</b> <b>guns,</b> some state and local governments do; the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence has compiled a list of states and selected municipalities that regulate <b>air</b> <b>guns,</b> finding that 23 states and the District of Columbia regulate <b>air</b> <b>guns</b> to some degree. Two states (New Jersey and Rhode Island) define all non-powder guns as firearms; one state (Illinois) defines certain high-power and/or large calibre non-powder guns as firearms; three states (Connecticut, Delaware and North Dakota) define non-powder guns as dangerous weapons (but not firearms). The remaining states which regulate <b>air</b> <b>guns</b> impose age restrictions on possession, use, or transfer of non-powder guns, and/or explicitly regulate possession of non-powder guns on school grounds.|$|R

25|$|The {{invention}} of the vacuum pump {{paved the way for}} the experiments of Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke into the nature of vacuum and atmospheric pressure. The first such device was made by Otto von Guericke in 1654. It consisted of a piston and an <b>air</b> <b>gun</b> cylinder with flaps that could suck the air from any vessel that it was connected to. In 1657, he pumped the air out of two conjoined hemispheres and demonstrated that a team of sixteen horses were incapable of pulling it apart. The air pump construction was greatly improved by Robert Hooke in 1658.|$|E
25|$|When Eric {{broke his}} arm {{at the age}} of eight, rather than to go home, he {{preferred}} to run away and hide, until he was found, shivering from pain. In this type of situation, Borel, who was known as a quiet and taciturn boy who kept to himself and rather tend the chickens in the backyard during his free time than to go out, grew up and developed an increasing admiration for the military, telling lies about heroic deeds of his father during the Indochina War and adoring his stepbrother Franck Bichet, who served in the army. He had an affection for weapons and used to shoot sparrows with an <b>air</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Poland {{the energy}} limit for <b>air</b> <b>guns</b> is 17 joules (<b>air</b> <b>guns</b> above this limit must be {{registered}} {{and may be}} used only on shooting ranges). Therefore, the PFTA (Polish Field Target Association) has adopted the British limit of 16.3 joules (12 ft⋅lbf) for competitions.|$|R
50|$|It {{is illegal}} to hunt with <b>air</b> <b>guns.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many {{practical}} applications were found as well, {{such as in}} the manufacture of <b>air</b> <b>guns</b> by Kunitomo Ikkansai, after he repaired and analyzed the mechanism of some Dutch <b>air</b> <b>guns</b> which had been offered to the Shogun in Edo. A vast industry of perpetual oil lamps (Mujin Hi) developed, also derived by Kunitomo from the mechanism of <b>air</b> <b>guns,</b> in which oil was continuously supplied through a compressed air mechanism. Kunitomo developed agricultural applications of these technologies, such as a giant pump powered by an ox, to lift irrigation water.|$|R
25|$|The young Mannock was a keen {{sports fan}} and he enjoyed Cricket and Football. Unlike {{some of his}} contemporaries he despised game hunting, and he kept birds and rabbits. As he grew older he became a keen angler. Mannock did enjoy {{shooting}} and used an <b>air</b> <b>gun</b> in target-shooting {{and he was also}} a passionate violin player, and was skilled with a variety of other instruments. When the Boer War began Mannock's father was transferred to South Africa where he fought in the 5th Dragoon Guards while the family stayed in India. When the war was over his father sent for the family and they moved to Canterbury in England. Mannock's father was a drunkard and suffered from depression. Two months after settling in England, he abandoned his wife and children and took the family's paltry savings with him.|$|E
25|$|In prehistoric times, chert {{was often}} used as a raw {{material}} {{for the construction of}} stone tools. Like obsidian, as well as some rhyolites, felsites, quartzites, and other tool stones used in lithic reduction, chert fractures in a Hertzian cone when struck with sufficient force. This results in conchoidal fractures, a characteristic of all minerals with no cleavage planes. In this kind of fracture, a cone of force propagates through the material from the point of impact, eventually removing a full or partial cone; this result is familiar to anyone who has seen what happens to a plate-glass window when struck by a small object, such as an <b>air</b> <b>gun</b> projectile. The partial Hertzian cones produced during lithic reduction are called flakes, and exhibit features characteristic of this sort of breakage, including striking platforms, bulbs of force, and occasionally eraillures, which are small secondary flakes detached from the flake's bulb of force.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Scally {{stated that}} {{he was sitting in}} Alley Pond Park on Winchester Boulevard, in the borough of Queens, at dusk with a female friend when a yellow Volkswagen Beetle {{approached}} his car door to door and only three inches apart from his vehicle, which did not have its engine running. Scally kept an <b>air</b> <b>gun</b> under his seat and, as the VW approached his car, the VW driver was met with the gun pointed straight at him. At first, he appeared to be a light-skinned black male, but he also appeared to be wearing a stocking over his face. The driver of the VW quickly started his car and gunned it in reverse out of the parking lot. Scally chased the car to a point in Glen Oaks, Queens, where the driver jumped out and ran. He did not want to leave his female passenger to give chase, so he telephoned the Son of Sam Hot Line. Detective Richard Carroll from the Son of Sam Task Force (and Scally's former baseball coach) later told Scally that he had indeed seen the Son of Sam. Glen Oaks was later revealed to be the home of Berkowitz's sister and was close {{to the site of the}} Donna DiMaise and Joanne LoMino shootings.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>air</b> <b>guns</b> were {{developed}} {{as early as}} the 1500s. They have been used in hunting, sporting and warfare. Modern <b>air</b> <b>guns</b> use one of three types of power source depending on the design: spring-piston, Gas piston, pre-charged pneumatic, multi pump pneumatic and bottled compressed gas (most commonly carbon dioxide).|$|R
50|$|Sheridan Products Inc. was an American company {{manufacturing}} <b>air</b> <b>guns.</b>|$|R
50|$|Daisy Outdoor Products (known {{primarily}} as Daisy) {{was formed in}} 1888 to manufacture windmills. As a sales promotion, they started providing <b>air</b> <b>guns</b> with the purchase of each windmill. With {{the popularity of the}} <b>air</b> <b>guns,</b> they began producing them for sale. In the 21st century, Daisy is known as a company that makes and sells entry and novice level BB <b>guns</b> and other <b>air</b> <b>guns.</b> Their Red Ryder BB Gun is perhaps their best known and longest production item which has been featured in many TV shows and movies since its introduction in the 1930s.|$|R
500|$|Air gunners are {{encouraged}} to perform shooting group tests with their gun clamped in a machine rest to establish which particular match pellet type performs best for their particular <b>air</b> <b>gun.</b> To facilitate maximum performance out of various air guns the leading match pellet manufacturers produce pellets with graduated [...] "head sizes", which means the pellets are offered with front diameters from 4.48mm up to 4.51mm.|$|E
500|$|Simone {{was known}} for her temper and {{frequent}} outbursts. In 1985, she fired a gun at a record company executive, whom she accused of stealing royalties. Simone said she [...] "tried to kill him" [...] but [...] "missed". In 1995, she shot and wounded her neighbor's son with an <b>air</b> <b>gun</b> after the boy's laughter disturbed her concentration. According to a biographer, Simone took medication for a condition from the mid-1960s on. All this was only known to {{a small group of}} intimates, and kept out of public view for many years, until the biography Break Down and Let It All Out written by Sylvia Hampton and David Nathan revealed this in 2004, after her death. [...] Singer-songwriter Janis Ian, a one-time friend of Simone's, related in her own autobiography, Society's Child: My Autobiography, two instances to illustrate Simone's volatility: one incident in which she forced a shoe store cashier, at gunpoint, to take back a pair of sandals she'd already worn; and another in which Simone demanded a royalty payment from Ian herself as an exchange for having recorded one of Ian's songs, and then ripped a pay telephone out of its wall when she was refused.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, the National Rifle Association (NRA) has like {{programs}} which use similar ranking systems as the CPRPFS's distinguished marksmanship programs where a shooter must {{work their way}} up to [...] "distinguished status" [...] by demonstrating repeated excellence in marksmanship. [...] The NRA's distinguished marksmanship programs focus on areas {{not covered by the}} CPRPF. [...] However, the NRA's newest program, the NRA Distinguished <b>Air</b> <b>Gun</b> Program, is in competition with the CPRPFS's Junior Distinguished Program as they both focus on <b>air</b> <b>gun</b> proficiency among American youth.|$|E

2500|$|In 1991, as {{a result}} of no longer being allowed to have animals at the house, Harvey and Bryant moved {{together}} onto a [...] farm called Taurusville that she had purchased in Copping, a small township. Neighbours recalled that he always carried an <b>air</b> <b>gun</b> and often fired it at tourists as they stopped to buy apples at a stall on the highway, and that late at night he would roam through the surrounding properties firing the gun at dogs when they barked at him. They avoided him [...] "at all costs" [...] despite his attempts to befriend them.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "The Empty House," [...] Holmes {{states that}} Moriarty had {{commissioned}} a powerful <b>air</b> <b>gun</b> from a blind German mechanic surnamed von Herder, {{which was used}} by Moriarty's employee/acolyte Colonel Moran. It closely resembled a cane, allowing for easy concealment, was capable of firing revolver bullets at long range, and made very little noise when fired, making it ideal for sniping. Moriarty also has a marked preference for organizing [...] "accidents." [...] His attempts to kill Holmes include falling masonry and a speeding horse-drawn vehicle. He is also responsible for stage-managing the death of Birdy Edwards, making it appear that he was lost overboard while sailing to South Africa.|$|E
