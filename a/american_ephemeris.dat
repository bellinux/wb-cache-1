50|$|Washington Mean Time was {{the time}} at the {{meridian}} {{through the center of}} the old dome atop the main building at the old US Naval Observatory at Washington, D.C.

The Old Naval Observatory is now on the grounds of the United States Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, southwest of the corner of E and 23rd Streets in Foggy Bottom (north of the Lincoln Memorial). Washington Mean Time was sometimes called Washington Meridian Time. It was never used as the basis of any time zone, although it was the local mean time of the city of Washington before the advent of American time zones on 18 November 1883. It was also used to time astronomical events by users of the <b>American</b> <b>Ephemeris</b> and Nautical Almanac, first published for the year 1855.|$|E

He was professor of mathematics in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1865 until his retirement in 1902.

5000|$|William Ferrel (January 29, 1817 [...] - [...] September 18, 1891), an American meteorologist, {{developed}} theories which {{explained the}} mid-latitude atmospheric circulation cell in detail, {{and it is}} after him that the Ferrel cell is named. He was born in southern Pennsylvania. His family moved to what would become West Virginia in 1829. His formal elementary schooling was limited and he taught himself using science books well enough to become a school teacher. He attended Marshall College [...] and despite financial difficulties, {{he was able to}} graduate from Bethany College's first graduating class in 1844. He would continue teaching in Missouri and Tennessee until 1858. At that point, he took up a full-time position on the staff of <b>American</b> <b>Ephemeris</b> and Nautical Almanac in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1882, Ferrel joined the U.S. Army Signal Service (which would become the Weather Bureau in 1891). He retired in 1887. He died in West Virginia in 1891.|$|E
50|$|In 1897, {{well after}} the Old Naval Observatory closed in 1892, the Coast and Geodetic Survey {{reported}} that its meridian was 77Â°3â€²2.3â€³ west of Greenwich, which was quoted for the next 50 years {{in the list of}} observatories in the Almanac as GMT âˆ’ 5812.15. This old Washington meridian was repealed on 22 August 1912. A later version of Washington mean time based on the merdian of the clock room at the exact center of the New Naval Observatory (77Â°4â€²2.24â€³W or GMT âˆ’ 5816.15) was still being used in 1950 on a few pages of the <b>American</b> <b>Ephemeris</b> and Nautical Almanac, even though most of its pages used Greenwich Civil Time, the American name for the midnight epoch Greenwich Mean Time. For astronomical purposes, before 1925 a day was considered to start at noon rather than the previous midnight. Thus to convert times of astronomical events before 1925 given in Washington mean time to modern Universal Time it is necessary to add an additional 12 hours beyond the meridian difference from Washington to Greenwich, totalling more than 17 hours.|$|E
5000|$|The third {{meridian}} {{was defined}} on September 28, 1850 by Congress: [...] "The meridian of the observatory at Washington shall be adopted {{and used as}} the American meridian for all astronomical purposes and ... the meridian of Greenwich shall be adopted for all nautical purposes." [...] The observatory decided that this meridian passed {{through the center of}} the original (small) dome atop the main building of the Old Naval Observatory, now abandoned southwest of the corner of E and 23rd Streets in Foggy Bottom (north of the Lincoln Memorial and west of the White House). The observatory adopted 77Â°2'48.0"W for its meridian in the <b>American</b> <b>Ephemeris</b> and Nautical Almanac for the years 1855 to 1869 (as 5h8m11.2s). In 1897, well after the observatory closed in 1892, the Coast and Geodetic Survey reported that its meridian was 77Â°3'2.3" [...] west of Greenwich, which was quoted for the next 50 years in the list of observatories in the Almanac (as 5h8m12.15s). When referred to later datums, this meridian has been variously specified as 77Â°3'6.119"W or 77Â°3'6.276"W (both presumably NAD 27). If NAD27, the latter would be 77Â°3'5.194"W (NAD 83) which seems to be within a few meters of the actual longitude, at worst. This meridian was repealed by Congress on August 22, 1912 to allow the Greenwich meridian to become the legal prime meridian of the United States.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the {{creation}} of time zones, cities had substantial differences in the standards of timeâ€”in Wisconsin alone, over thirty-eight times were used at a given moment. In 1908, Theodore Roosevelt finally demanded that the United States Bureau of Standards encourage precise timing across the nation. In 1910, the Elgin National Watch Company decided to respond by building its own observatory so that the timing in its watches would be scientifically accurate. Dr. William W. Payne of the Goodsell Observatory was named the first director. Sidereal time was determined on Riefler Clock No. 220 by measuring the position of the stars in the night sky based on the position of the telescope (which could only move north-south along a meridian line). Eleven vertical wires were inside the telescope eyepiece. An astronomer would press a button every time a star appeared to cross one of the wires, which would send an impulse to the clock. This was compared with the solar time observed on the Riefler Clock No. 224 and results published by the <b>American</b> <b>Ephemeris</b> and Nautical Almanac. The result was a clock that was accurate to the hundredth of a second. In the factory, the sounder audibly ticked off the seconds so that workers could set the watches accurately. After the opening of the observatory, the Elgin National Watch Company adopted the slogan: [...] "Elgin Takes The Time From The Stars And Puts It In Your Pocket". The Illinois government also equipped the observatory with thermometers, a thermograph, barometer, barograph, rain gauge, and weather vane. This was intended to provide data on weather to Springfield, but was also reproduced in local newspapers. The company was watchful of humidity, as this could affect delicate processes.|$|E

Interferometric observations of Saturn and the rings {{have been obtained}} at 3. 71 and 1. 30 cm wavelengths. The observations have been analyzed by both model fitting and aperture synthesis techniques. They show that the rings have a very low brightness temperature, but attenuate the thermal emission from the planet significantly where they cross in front of it. The latter effect, when combined with the estimate of the ring brightness temperature, permits the optical depths of the rings to be estimated. The fits of the interferometric data to Saturn models in which the A and B rings are combined into a single ring are given in Table (1). The 3. 71 cm observations were made at two epochs and the relative areas of the A and B rings that obscured the planet were different. The apparently inconsistent optical depth results of the two 3. 71 cm data sets, then, indicate that the A ring optical depth is significantly {{less than that of}} the B ring. The relative areas of the A and B rings are the same for the 1976 1. 30 cm and 3. 71 cm observations and their optical depth results may be directly compared. They indicate that the ring optical depths are the same at the two wavelengths. These optical depths are quite similar to those estimated at visible wavelengths. The ring brightness temperatures, which are shown in the table normalized by the brightness temperature of the planet to remove any errors in the absolute calibration of the data, are also the same at the two wavelengths. No variation in the brightness temperature of the rings with tilt angle (B) was detected. A significant amount of radiation from the C ring was detected by the 3. 71 cm observations, and the ring was also found to attenuate the planetary emission significantly. Unfortunately, the 1. 30 cm observations were not sensitive enough to detect the C ring. The brightness temperature and optical depth results for the individual rings that are implied by all of the 3. 71 cm observations are given in Table (ii). Limb-darkening of the planetary emission was simulated by solving for the best fitting planetary radius. No limb-darkening was detected at 3. 71 cm, but an apparently significant amount was detected at 1. 30 cm. The results at the two wavelengths are significantly different and indicate that the planet is more limb-dark at 1. 30 cm than at 3. 71 cm. This finding is interesting since it is contrary to what was predicted by atmospheric models which fit the Saturn microwave spectrum. The aperture synthesis analysis is independent of the model fitting and can be used to confirm its results and search for new features not included in the models. The aperture synthesis maps confirm the model fitting results and require no new brightness structures. In particular, no azimuthal variations of the brightness temperature of the rings were detected. The aperture synthesis maps also indicated that the true position of Saturn may be offset from the values given in the <b>American</b> <b>Ephemeris</b> and Nautical Almanac by about 0. 3 arcsec. Consideration of simple physical models of the rings has shown that the radiation from the rings at centimeter wavelengths is almost entirely thermal emission from the planet that is scattered to the Earth by the ring particles. The models indicate that the ring particles are very good scatterers and very poor emitters at microwave wavelengths, and this conclusion sets constraints upon the size and composition of the ring particles. The similarity between the optical depths of the rings at visible and centimeter wavelengths probably indicates that the particles are much larger (â‰¥ 1 meter) than the centimeter wavelengths. The large sizes and excellent scattering properties of the particles indicate that they are composed of either a highly reflective or transparent material. At this time water ice is the most likely candidate, since it has been detected in the rings spectroscopically and is known to be highly transparent to microwaves at the low temperatures found at Saturn's rings.
