40|$|Behavioural {{conflict}} {{between mother and}} offspring was investigated in a captive population of the Saharan arrui (<b>Ammotragus</b> <b>lervia</b> sahariensis, Artiodactyla: Bovidae). The frequency of agonistic behaviours (mother's aggressiveness and calf's retreats) and unsuccessful suckling attempts, Hinde's proximity index and the distances between mother and calf have been analysed in relation to weaning and sexual activity of the mother. Mothers that conceive in the following mating season accelerate the weaning process of their current offspring; furthermore, high-ranking females wean their male calves earlier. Behavioural conflict occurs during the resumption of the mother's sexual activity; however, no conflict appears to happen during weaning.

40|$|At Uan Afuda, {{and other}} Early Holocene {{sites of the}} Acacus mountains, in the Libyan Sahara, dung layers and plant {{accumulation}} are a major, but repeatedly neglected, feature of hunter-gatherer communities. To understand the formation and meaning of such features, a multidimensional analysis has been undertaken, combining micromorphological, palynological, botanical, archaeozoological, and archaeological data. The hypothesis here formulated is twofold: plant accumulations are evidence of anthropic activity aimed at the storage of fodder; and dung layers are related to a forced penning of a ruminant, very likely Barbary sheep (<b>Ammotragus</b> <b>lervia).</b> The exploration of these two features has hinted at {{the existence of a}} deep reciprocal relationship, which has been interpreted as the cultural control of wild Barbary sheep, leading to a delayed use of food resources.

Parameters of microbial fermentation in the rumen as well as rumen tissue samples were examined. Additionally, the offered and refused food was weighed, analysed and a dietary intake calculation for these ruminant species was performed. Three of the four ruminant species – blackbuck, barbary sheep and addax antelope – all grazers, showed severe characteristics of subacute ruminal acidosis due to a diet high in fermentable carbohydrates (NfE ≥ 55 % of DM basis) and low in fibre (XF ≤ 18 % of DM basis). This was indicated by numerous microabscesses within the rumen mucosa. These results demonstrate that subacute ruminal acidosis is still a severe problem in captive wild ruminants, which are often fed inappropriate diets with a high concentration of easily digestible carbohydrates...|$|R

The phylogenetic analyses of Ropiquet & Hassanin (2005) based on mitochondrial and nuclear markers have provided strong evidence for the polyphyly of Hemitragus: H. jemlahicus was found be associated with Capra (goats), H. hylocrius with Ovis (sheep), and H. jayakari with <b>Ammotragus</b> <b>lervia</b> (aoudad). Two new genera were erected: Arabitragus for the Arabian tahr and Nilgiritragus for the Nilgiri tahr.

40|$|Variables {{that may}} affect birth mass and adult body mass/length in captive Saharan arruis (aoudads), <b>Ammotragus</b> <b>lervia,</b> were analyzed.

Previous considerations and strong sexual dimorphism made it advisable to perform separate analyses for males and females. As expected, there was {{a positive relationship between}} age and growth. As adults, singleton females were larger than females that had a littermate; also, females raised by older mothers were heavier at sexual maturity. Birth mass, maternal age, and individual inbreeding coefficient had no effect on adult phenotype. At birth there already appeared to be significant sexual dimorphism, and singletons were heavier than twins. High inbreeding coefficients yielded lighter calves.

50|$|His work, however, {{reached its}} peak in 1971 onwards, when, in {{collaboration}} with Valverde, he created the La Hoya Nature Reserve, on a farm owned by the CSIC, located {{in the neighborhood of}} that name, towards the back of the citadel of the Almeria capital. Valverde and Cano, particularly sensitive about the little-studied situation of the North African gazelle species, such as the dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas neglecta) and the dama gazelle or springbok Mohor (Gazella dama), decided to undertake captive breeding, a successful pioneering act at the time. It was the Spanish Army who assisted in the capture of the species required in the Sahara Desert. In 1975 the Natural Reserve became the Saharan Wildlife Rescue Park, under the umbrella of the Ministry of Education and Science and the Arid Zone Experimental Station of Almeria. The Park performs an important task of breeding and reintroduction of species of North African gazelles, including the above plus other species such as Cuvier's gazelle (Gazella cuvieri) and aoudad Sahara (<b>Ammotragus</b> <b>lervia</b> sahariensis).|$|R
40|$|Indio Mountains Research Station (IMRS), in the {{northern}} Chihuahuan Desert, contains one natural, permanent spring (Squaw Spring) and many man-made ephemerally-full tanks, {{both of which are}} presumably important for the survival of many species residing in that area. The goal {{of this study was to}} monitor wildlife use of these water bodies using motion sensor cameras to determine species-specific preferences for individual water bodies, temporal activity patterns and the reasons for these preferences. We installed motion sensor cameras and water level loggers at five different water bodies throughout IMRS. The dominant mammals visiting the tanks were peccary (Pecari tajacu), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and barbary sheep (<b>Ammotragus</b> <b>lervia).</b> Occasional visits by cattle, which are usually excluded from IMRS, resulted in substantial declines in wildlife visits. When the tanks were full, the frequency of mammal visits increased; only peccary visited dry tanks. Unlike other mammals, which largely drank from the ponds, peccary were observed eating vegetation and cooling off in the mud. Research on mammal activity in the desert is challenging due to the extreme environmental conditions. This study has shown that both natural and man-made tanks are important for the survival of many species that reside in this area...|$|R
40|$|For a {{long time}} the Central Sahara has been {{considered}} as a possible centre of autonomous animal domestication, given the early radiocarbon determinations of cattle remains, dated {{to the end of}} the 8 th millennium bp. Actually, the process of cattle domestication has not been definitely explained in other regions of North Africa, such as the Egyptian Nile valley and Western Desert, where there have been claimed to be autonomous forms of cattle domestication at 9500 - 8800 years bp. Recent analyses of early Holocene settlements of hunter-gatherers in southwestern Libya, in the Tadrart Acacus massif, yielded evidence for wild animal management at 9000 - 8000 years bp. Plant accumulations and Barbary sheep (<b>Ammotragus</b> <b>lervia)</b> dung layers implicate forced presence of these animals in mountain caves, probably for some form of planned exploitation during lean periods. Archaeological, geoarchaeological, archaeozoological and palaeobotanical data are consistent with the hypothesis of Barbary sheep penning during the early Holocene in the Acacus. This should be considered as the most ancient form of cultural control over animal resources in this region of Africa, with profound implications in subsistence strategies and social control among early Holocene hunter-gatherers...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{geographical}} distribution and habitat suitability of an introduced ungulate, the aoudad (<b>Ammotragus</b> <b>lervia),</b> {{that is currently}} expanding its range in south-eastern Iberian Peninsula. We assessed the niche of the species using Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) on (1) environmental variables (climate and habitat type), and (2) potential aoudad landscape avoidance and human disturbance variables. We compared both niche descriptions to study the impact of human interference on niche selection of the species. ENFA models were calibrated using data on the population expanded from the original release location, in Sierra Espuña mountains, and validated using data from another free-ranging population, originated independently in the Alicante province. The habitat suitability model for the purely environmental niche predicts a potential distribution along a SW–NE axis in the study area, following the Cordillera Sub-Bética mountain range, being constrained by low winter precipitation, high altitude, high terrain slope, {{and the presence of}} forest. In addition to these ecological traits, roads and landscape use restricted the environmental range potentially available for the species.

40|$|A micro-histological {{analysis}} of composite faecal samples {{was used to}} determine the food plants consumed by the aoudad <b>Ammotragus</b> <b>lervia</b> (Barbary sheep) in the mountains of Bou Hedma National Park, as well as to study food preferences and seasonal variation of the diet of this ungulate. A total of 19 plant species was identified in the faecal samples: 8 grasses, 6 browse types and 5 forbs. The annual diet of this ungulate is composed of approximately 67 % grasses, 17 % browse and 16 % forbs. Two grass species, Stipa parviflora and Stipa tenacissima, comprised 97 % of grasses consumed and 63 % of the annual diet, and were eaten in the year with considerably greater frequency than any other plant species. The diet of the aoudad at Bou Hedma National Park showed a seasonal variation. For example, grasses were consumed the entire year with a preference in spring (72. 57 %) and summer (78. 31 %), but their occurrence in the diet dropped in winter (38. 7 %). Browse was eaten preferentially in autumn (21. 86 %) and forbs were utilised most during winter (43. 22 %) and least during summer (7. 53 %).

40|$|Background: The chamois, {{distributed}} {{over most}} of the medium to high altitude mountain ranges of southern Eurasia, provides an excellent model for exploring the effects of historical and evolutionary events on diversification. Populations have been grouped into two species, Rupicapra pyrenaica from southwestern Europe and R. rupicapra from eastern Europe. The study of matrilineal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and biparentally inherited microsatellites showed that the two species are paraphyletic and indicated alternate events of population contraction and dispersal-hybridization in the diversification of chamois. Here we investigate the pattern of variation of the Y-chromosome to obtain information on the patrilineal phylogenetic position of the genus Rupicapra and on the male-specific dispersal of chamois across Europe. Results: We analyzed the Y-chromosome of 87 males covering the distribution range of the Rupicapra genus. We sequenced a fragment of the SRY gene promoter and characterized the male specific microsatellites UMN 2303 and SRYM 18. The SRY promoter sequences of two samples of Barbary sheep (<b>Ammotragus</b> <b>lervia)</b> were also determined and compared with the sequences of Bovidae available in the GenBank.

40|$|Calf {{suckling}} behaviour {{is a valid}} {{measure of}} maternal investment in the Saharan arrui, <b>Ammotragus</b> <b>lervia</b> sahariensis, since this variable is strongly correlated with the inter-birth interval. High-ranking females allocate their resources preferentially towards their sons, as the average suckling rate is significantly higher in male calves than in female calves during their 1 st month of life, when maternal investment reaches the highest values of the whole lactation period. However, average suckling-bout duration shows no sex differences. Some maternal behaviours, such as sniffing and licking, are strongly correlated with suckling events. Only during the calves’ 1 st week is the mother responsible for maintaining proximity; but from the following week on the calves are mainly responsible for maintaining it. In addition, when the calves are 1 month old, high-ranking females tend to maintain a stronger link with their male calves. Female calves {{spend more time with}} their mothers than male calves during their 1 st month of life, if the mother’s rank is lower than 60 %; otherwise, the opposite occurs, male calves being close to their mothers for longer, even from their 1 st week of life.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of individuals' behavior when accessing a restricted food source (troughs) {{was carried out}} in a captive population of aoudad (<b>Ammotragus</b> <b>lervia).</b> Access to the troughs followed a strict hierarchical order, as higher-ranking individuals fed before lower-ranking ones. Unweaned male and female calves made use of the troughs from the ages of 2 and 3 months, respectively. Both fed from the troughs more frequently and for longer periods when their mother was present, which allowed them {{to make use of the}} troughs while skipping the hierarchical order. Calves received fewer threats when in proximity to their mothers, particularly in high-ranking families. Mothers defended their calves from other herdmates more frequently when at the feeding area than in other areas of the herd. However, only sated mothers let their calves feed freely from the troughs; unsated mothers showed an aggressive behavior even toward their calves. I conclude that a maternal presence is necessary for aoudad calves to successfully feed from troughs, and that families of higher social rank benefit by getting access to this food source earlier in the day and are disturbed less than low-ranking families.

40|$|Evidence of aoudad <b>Ammotragus</b> <b>lervia</b> {{expansion}} in the southeastern quarter of the Iberian Peninsula is provided based on recent field surveys. Aoudad has become common in a limited region of the southeast of Spain since its introduction as a game species in Sierra Espuña Natural Park in 1970. Its adaptability enabled it to colonise nearby areas in a short period. Apart from this source of expansion, {{the increasing number of}} aoudads in Spanish private game reserves provided other centres of dispersion. In addition, aoudads were introduced on La Palma Island (Canary Islands), becoming a serious threat to endemic flora. Of great conservation concern is the species' potential as a competitor against native ungulates inhabiting the peninsula. Surveys conducted in southern Spain documented rapid colonization of new areas and established viable populations, consisting of adult males and females and the unequivocal presence of nursery groups, in the provinces of Alicante, Almería, Granada and Murcia. Also, aoudads have spread throughout the north and centre of La Palma. There are two main conservational concerns: the necessity of conducting detailed and reliable surveys in all potential regions where the species might expand, and the urgent need of changing current game policies in order to establish reliable controls on big game reserves to prevent animals from escaping.

Sequence analysis of the PCR products derived from Cryptosporidium oocysts from Black leopard (Panthera pardus), Heijing He (Grus nigricollis), Barbary sheep (<b>Ammotragus</b> <b>lervia),</b> Takin (Budorcas taxicolor), Lesser panda (Ailurus fulgens), and White-eared pheasant (Crossoptilon crossoptilon) fecal samples matched that of Cryptosporidium parvum mouse genotype. Sequence analyses of other PCR products were consistent with cervine genotype Cryptosporidium from Ibex (Capra ibex), a novel Cryptosporidium genotype from a wild yak (Bos mutus), C. bovis–like genotype from one goat sample and also a novel Cryptosporidium genotype from one other separate goat sample. The present work reports the first data on Cryptosporidium infections in animals from the Qinghai province of mountainous central western China and the first findings of the ‘cervine’ genotype in Capra ibex, C. bovis–like genotype and the new Cryptosporidium spp. in farm goat and in wild yak...|$|R
