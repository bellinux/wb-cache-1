One {{of them is the}} <b>Asian</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>psyllid</b> (Diaphorina citri Kuwayama), an efficient vector of the Liberobacter asiaticum. Generalist predators such as the ladybird beetles Curinus coeruleus, Olla v-nigrum, Harmonia axyridis, and Cycloneda sanguinea, and the lacewings Ceraeochrysa spp. and Chrysoperla spp. make significant contribution to the mortality of the <b>Asian</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>psyllid,</b> which results in 80–100% reduction in psyllid populations. In contrast, parasitism by Tamarixia radiata, a species-specific parasitoid of the <b>Asian</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>psyllid,</b> is variable and generally low in southwest Florida: in 2006, it amounted to a reduction of less than 12% from May to September and 50% in November.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, foliar {{applications}} of insecticides reduced psyllid populations {{for a short}} time, but also suppressed the populations of predatory ladybird beetles.

40|$|Control of <b>Asian</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>psyllids</b> is {{critical}} for the citrus industry to survive.   Citrus growers urgently need to be provided with new tools using recent technological developments for best control practices.   One approach {{is the use of}} plant-based or natural volatile repellent compounds.   Although there have been significant advances in laboratory studies, there is still no effective repellency system developed for field usage.   Most importantly, even if the most effective psyllid repellent is utilized, its field performance may be less than desired if the most effective method of delivery is not employed.   A system approach is required – the volatile repellent must be “matched” to the delivery methodology – to achieve the optimal overall repellency system, which also requires a physicochemical and engineering understanding of the repellency system employed to provide the sought-after control strategy.   This presentation will examine both wax-based and vapor-based dispensing approaches.   The volatile substances released from wax-based formulations are analogous to “contact repellents”, whereas those released from vapor-based systems function as “spatial repellents” – two different approaches for delivery of volatile repellent compounds.   We present a break-through in the art of controlled delivery of volatile compounds using a system approach.   The Auburn vapor-based invention has many advantages, one of which is the flexibility it offers in the design and engineering of vapor delivery systems for biocontrol strategies in the citrus industry...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{volatiles}} play {{an important}} role in defending plants against insects and pathogens attack. Released volatiles from insect-damaged plants may result in direct or indirect defense against insect, and volatile accumulation in pathogen-infected plants may inhibit the movement of the pathogens within plant tissues.   However, available information about the response of citrus leaf volatiles to <b>Asian</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>psyllids</b> (ACP) feeding and ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’ (Clas) infection is limited.   Here we investigate the effect of ACP feeding, Clas infection, and simultaneous attack by ACP and Clas on the volatile content of Valencia leaves.   Leaf volatiles were extracted using hexane and analyzed with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).   Eighteen out of  twenty-seven detected volatiles were induced (2 to 10 -folds) in ACP-infested plants.   On the other hand, only four volatiles were induced in Clas-infected plants (d-limonene, β-phelandrene, citronellal, and undecanl).   The abundance of latter compounds was induced 4 -folds in Clas-infected plants, except for limonene, which was induced  more than 20 -folds.   In addition, citrus plants that were subjected to  a simultaneous attack by ACP and Clas reduced their volatiles production compared to those that experience an attack only by ACP.   Our results suggested that insect and pathogen attack not only changes the profile of plant released volatiles, but also influences the volatile contents of the attacked plants. The result of this study might contribute to better understanding of citrus response to ACP and Clas attacks and provide more information about the relation between stored and released volatiles...|$|R
40|$|In July 2012, we {{captured}} <b>Asian</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>psyllids</b> (ACP), Diaphorina citri, at the Lake Kissimmee State Park (Polk county, FL). ACP {{were captured}} on yellow sticky traps deployed in a wet flatwood ecosystem. Specimens {{were sent to}} the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) and were all identified as D. citri. From the 12 July through 8 October 2012, we monitored the ACP population at this location. Capture of ACP on 19 July reached a maximum of 1. 3 ACP per trap per week. ACP collected were submitted to qPCR and 20 % of captured ACP in this forest were positive for Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (Las). After exploration of the surrounding area, we found four non-cultivated tangerine plants on the border of Lake Rosalie, 1 km away from the original ACP collection site. These four plants were tested for Las and all were negative. Yellow sticky traps were also deployed on these citrus trees but no ACP were collected at this location. Plants found in the original area of collection were identified, and to our knowledge, none are currently known as alternative hosts of ACP. We are performing bioassays and thus far, we found that ACP were able to feed and survive on gallberry (Ilex glabra L.). These results suggest that ACP may have a wider alternative host acceptance range and / or higher dispersal ability than previously thought and occur within a dense Florida forest in the absence of surrounding citrus groves within at least 3 km...|$|R

40|$|The {{honeydew}} {{composition of}} <b>Asian</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>psyllids</b> (ACP), the vector of citrus Huanglongbing (HLB), was studied using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Honeydew {{samples were collected}} from healthy ACP that were reared on one-year Valencia trees inside an insectary at a University of Florida’s Citrus Research and Education Center (CREC) grove in Lake Alfred, FL, USA. Dried samples (1 mg) were mixed with 30 μL of methoxyamine hydrochloride solution in pyridine (2 %) and allowed to react for 17 h at room temperature. After methoximation, silylation reactions were induced by adding 80 μL of N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyl) trifluoracetamide (MSTFA) for 2 h at room temperature and 0. 5 μL of derivatized sample was injected into the GC-MS running in the full scan mode. To check for amino acids, a 10 mg of alkaline honeydew sample was reacted with methylchloroformate (MCF) {{in a mixture of}} pyridine and methanol. The MCF derivatives were extracted with chloroform and analyzed with GC-MS. The moisure content was determined by drying the honeydew samples to a constant weight at a 100 °C. The major honeydew composition was as follows: 74. 5 ± 2. 8 sucrose, 12. 4 ± 0. 5 D-fructose, 6. 4 ± 3. 0 mannose,  1. 8 ± 0. 6 trehalose, myo-inositol 2. 8 ± 0. 8, ribitol 0. 5 ± 1, galactose 0. 4 ± 0. 2, quinic acid 0. 4 ± 0. 3, and malic acid 0. 3 ± 0. 1.

40|$|Transgenic citrus scion (mostly {{grapefruit}} {{and sweet}} orange) and rootstock cultivars (Carrizo and experimental complex tetraploids) were transformed with gene(s) encoding antimicrobial peptides or {{systemic acquired resistance}} (SAR) proteins. Each transgene was under control of an enhanced CaMV 35 S promoter. Several genes were also under control of a phloem specific Arabidopsis SUC 2 (AtSUC 2) promoter.  A number of clones of each transgenic line (at least 3 replicate plants per clone) were evaluated for resistance to Huanglongbing (HLB, caused by Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus). 650 clones, from over 180 individual transgenic lines planted in spring 2009 in a heavily HLB infected Martin County grove were tested using qPCR for infection to HLB after 30 months in field. 396 trees tested negative for the HLB bacterium. Approximately 200 clones were observed to be healthy and flushing after 40 months {{in the field and}} were again evaluated using qPCR during June 2012. We did not detect the Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus bacterium in a majority of these trees. In a separate trial in St. Lucie County, 300 clones, from over 80 individual transgenic lines planted during 2010 were evaluated in October 2012. Similar trends were observed to that seen in our Martin County site.   345 transgenic clones and controls containing the same transgene(s) were also placed in a greenhouse containing free flying HLB-infected <b>Asian</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>psyllids</b> (ACP) during April 2011. All trees were evaluated for infection after 12 months by qPCR, and 80 % of the transgenic trees tested negative for the bacterium.   These results suggest that some of the antimicrobial peptides and SAR-inducing proteins can provide long-term resistance against HLB...|$|R
50|$|The causative {{agents are}} fastidious phloem-restricted, Gram-negative {{bacteria}} in the gracilicutes clade. The Asian form, Ca. L. asiaticus is heat tolerant. This means the greening symptoms can develop at temperatures up to 35°C. The African form, Ca. L. africanus, and American form, Ca. L. americanus, are heat sensitive, thus symptoms only develop when the temperature is in the range 20-25°C.

40|$|Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’ (Las) is the {{prevalent}} species {{of three different}} Liberibacter associated with citrus huanglongbing (HLB). Two psyllid species, Diaphorina citri and Trioza erytreae, are currently known to transmit Liberibacter bacteria. In this study, we tested the acquisition and transmission efficiency of Las by striped mealybugs (Ferrisia virgata) (Pseudococcidae; Hemiptera), another phloem-sap feeding insect with a broad host range of 264 species in 68 plant families. In our previous report, 63. 0 % of striped mealybugs collected from the Las-infected periwinkle plants in USHRL greenhouse tested positive for Las using the HLBasp primers and probe, and the Las populations were estimated at 3. 11 x 103 to 2. 32 x 105 cells per mealybug. This was confirmed using conventional PCR with six primer sets targeting different Las loci and by the 100 % identity of all seven PCR amplicons to the known Las sequences. However, attempts to transmit the disease in periwinkle and citrus using Las-infected mealybugs were not successful. To reveal the reason why Las-infected mealybugs {{were not able to}} transmit the disease, we used a leaf-disc bioassay in conjunction with typing of Las populations. Positive Las results were found in 100 % of the mealybugs after feeding for 1 - 2 weeks on infected leaf discs that were obtained from infected periwinkle and citrus leaves. In addition, Las bacteria were detected in mealybug gut, salivary glands and body cavity, with the titer in the gut and body being higher than that in the salivary glands. It is of interest to note that mealybugs grown on infected leaf-discs for 1 week and then transferred to non-infected leaf-discs did not test positive for Las. However, mealybugs grown on infected leaf-discs for 2 weeks and then transferred to non-infected leaf-discs for 2 more weeks remained positive for Las. These results indicate that striped mealybugs share similarities and differences in comparison with the <b>Asian</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>psyllids</b> in terms of acquisition and/or transmission of the Las bacterium...|$|R

50|$|Citrus {{plants are}} very liable to {{infestation}} by aphids, whitefly and scale insects (e.g. California red scale). Also rather important are the viral infections to {{which some of}} these ectoparasites serve as vectors such as the aphid-transmitted Citrus tristeza virus which when unchecked by proper methods of control is devastating to citrine plantations. The newest threat to citrus groves in the United States is the <b>Asian</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>psyllid.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>citrus</b> <b>psyllid</b> {{is found}} in Cameroon, Comoros, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Réunion, Rwanda, South Africa, St. Helena, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zaire, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. It {{is also found in}} Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and the Macaronesian archipelagos of Madeira and the Canary islands. It is {{sensitive}} to hot, dry conditions and favours cool, moist areas 500 m above sea level. Recently has been introduced to Spain through Galicia. However, the citrus greening disease has not been detected yet.|$|R
50|$|The adult psyllid {{is about}} four millimetres long with a fawn and brown mottled {{body and a}} light brown head. It {{is covered with a}} whitish, waxy {{secretion}} which makes it look dusty. The forewings are broadest at the back and have a dark edging around the periphery with a pale gap near the apex. The antennae are pale brown with black tips. These features distinguish it from the superficially similar African <b>citrus</b> <b>psyllid.</b> It typically adopts a head down, tail up posture as it sucks sap. Aphids are often also present on <b>citrus</b> and <b>psyllids</b> can be distinguished from them by being more active, jumping insects, whereas aphids are sedentary. In addition, the antennae of a psyllid has ten segments whereas those of aphids usually have four or six segments. Most aphids have cornicles on the abdomen and psyllids lack these.|$|R
50|$|The {{distribution}} of the African <b>citrus</b> <b>psyllid</b> includes Africa, Madeira, Saudi Arabia, Portugal, and Yemen This species is sensitive to high temperatures and will not develop at temperatures greater than 25°C. It is also a vector of the African strain of huanglongbing (Candidatus Liberibacter africanus), which is also sensitive to heat. This strain of HLB is reported to occur in Africa, (Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Comoros, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Reunion, Rwanda, South Africa, St. Helena (unconfirmed), Swaziland, Tanzania, Zimbabwe), Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. The disease was not reported in the EU or USA as of 2004; however see above.|$|R
50|$|HLB was {{originally}} {{thought to be}} a viral disease, but was later discovered to be caused by bacteria, carried by insect vectors. HLB infection can arise in various climates and is often associated with different species of psyllid insects. For example, citrus crops in Africa become infected under cool conditions as the bacteria are transmitted by the African citrus psyllid Trioza ertreae, an invasive insect that favors cool and moist conditions for optimal growth. Citrus crops in Asia, however, are often infected under warm conditions as the bacteria are transmitted by the <b>Asian</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>psyllid</b> Diaphorina citri.|$|E
50|$|According to UF/IFAS Citrus Extension of University of Florida, some {{cultural}} practices {{can be effective}} in monitoring this disease. Cultural methods include antibacterial management, sanitation, removal of infected plants, frequent scouting, and most importantly, crisis declaration. Tracking the disease will help prevent further infection in other affected areas and help mitigate more local infections if detected early enough. The <b>Asian</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>psyllid</b> has alternative hosts such as Murraya paniculata, Severinia buxifolia, and other plants in the Rutaceae family. Clearing or controlling these alternative hosts {{will be an important}} consideration as they may attract psyllids to citrus plants in the vicinity.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>psyllid</b> has {{a number}} of natural enemies {{including}} hoverflies, lacewings, several species of ladybird and a number of species of parasitic wasp. One of these wasps, Tamarixia radiata, has proved very effective at controlling the pest and has been successfully released and become established in a number of citrus growing areas including Florida. Both adults and nymphs of the psyllid can be controlled by the use {{of a wide range of}} insecticides. Citrus greening disease is best controlled through an integrated strategy involving the use of healthy planting material, the prompt removal of infected trees and branches and the control of vectors.|$|E
