A sample of seawater taken on 22 March 330m south of the discharge channel (30kilometers off the coastline) had elevated levels of I-131 and Cs-137. Also, north of the plant elevated levels of these isotopes were found on 22 March (as well as Cs-134, tellurium-129 and tellurium-129m (Te-129m)), although the levels were lower. Samples taken on 23 and/or 24 March contained about 80Bq/mL of iodine-131 (1850 times the statutory limit) and 26Bq/mL and caesium-137, most likely caused by <b>atmospheric</b> <b>deposition.</b> By 26 and 27 March this level had decreased to 50Bq/mL (11) iodine-131 and 7Bq/mL (2.9) caesium-137 (80 times the limit).

40|$|The Adirondacks of New York State, USA is {{a region}} that is {{sensitive}} to <b>atmospheric</b> mercury (Hg) <b>deposition.</b> In this study, we estimated <b>atmospheric</b> Hg <b>deposition</b> to the Adirondacks using a new scheme that combined numerical modeling and limited experimental data. The majority of the land cover in the Adirondacks is forested with 47 % of the total area deciduous, 20 % coniferous and 10 % mixed. We used litterfall plus throughfall deposition as the total <b>atmospheric</b> Hg <b>deposition</b> to coniferous and deciduous forests during the leaf-on period, and wet Hg <b>deposition</b> plus modeled <b>atmospheric</b> dry Hg <b>deposition</b> as the total Hg deposition to the deciduous forest during the leaf-off period and for the non-forested areas year-around. To estimate <b>atmospheric</b> dry Hg <b>deposition</b> we used the Big Leaf model.

40|$|The Asian dust {{source region}} may be {{expanding}} {{primarily as a}} result of recent climate change, especially during the 2000 s. This change was investigated by examining anthropogenic radionuclides contained in surface soil samples from Mongolia. Surface soil was globally labeled by radioactive fallout from nuclear testing during the late 1950 s and early 1960 s. There are no current direct sources for anthropogenic radionuclides in the air, so the radionuclides in the atmosphere are mainly carried by dust from wind-blown surface soil, that is, aeolian dust. Asian dust carries 90 Sr, 137 Cs, and other anthropogenic radionuclides; the heaviest deposition occurs in spring and has been recorded in Japan since the early 1990 s. The composition of anthropogenic radionuclides in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>depositions</b> would be affected by a change in the dust source. Previous studies of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>depositions</b> at long-term monitoring sites (e. g. in Tsukuba, Japan) have detected changes in the 137 Cs/ 90 Sr ratio and in the specific activity of the radionuclides. These changes in the composition of observed <b>atmospheric</b> <b>depositions</b> should be a reflection for a change in the climatic conditions of the dust source region. To investigate this dust source change, a field survey for radionuclides ( 90 Sr and 137 Cs) in surface soil samples was conducted in September 2007 in the eastern and southern regions of Mongolia, where dust storms have occurred more frequently since 2000. It was found that specific activities of both radionuclides as well as the 137 Cs/ 90 Sr ratio in the surface soil correlated well with annual average precipitation in the Mongolian desert-steppe zone. The higher specific activities and the higher 137 Cs/ 90 Sr ratio were found in the grassland region with the greater precipitation. This finding suggests that the increased specific activities and the activity ratio detected in the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>depositions</b> in Japan during years of the frequent Asian dust transport event since 2000 should be a sign of grassland degradation...|$|R

2500|$|Despite land-use {{planning}} and export of treated sewage effluent from the basin, {{the lake is}} becoming increasingly eutrophic (having an excessive richness of nutrients), with primary productivity increasing by more than 5% annually, and clarity decreasing at an average rate of 0.25 meters per year. [...] Until the early 1980s, nutrient-limitation studies showed that primary productivity in the lake was nitrogen-limited. Now, after a half-century of accelerated nitrogen input (much of it from direct <b>atmospheric</b> <b>deposition),</b> the lake is phosphorus-limited. Theodore Swift et al., concluded that [...] "suspended inorganic sediments and phytoplanktonic algae both contribute significantly to the reduction in clarity, and that suspended particulate matter, rather than dissolved organic matter, are the dominant causes of clarity loss." [...] The largest source of fine sediment particles to Lake Tahoe is urban stormwater runoff, comprising 72 {{percent of the total}} fine sediment particle load. Recent research has shown that the urban uplands also provide the largest opportunity to reduce fine sediment particle and phosphorus contributions to the lake. Historic clarity of approximately 30 meters can be achieved with total reduction of approximately 75 percent from urban sources.|$|E
2500|$|Phosphorus is {{important}} for all organisms {{because it is a}} component of DNA and RNA and is involved in cell metabolism as a component of ATP and ADP. [...] Also, phosphorus is not found in large quantities in freshwater systems, limiting photosynthesis in primary producers, making it the main determinant of lentic system production. [...] The phosphorus cycle is complex, but the model outlined below describes the basic pathways. [...] Phosphorus mainly enters a pond or lake through runoff from the watershed or by <b>atmospheric</b> <b>deposition.</b> [...] Upon entering the system, a reactive form of phosphorus is usually taken up by algae and macrophytes, which release a non-reactive phosphorus compound as a byproduct of photosynthesis. [...] This phosphorus can drift downwards and become part of the benthic or profundal sediment, or it can be remineralized to the reactive form by microbes in the water column. [...] Similarly, non-reactive phosphorus in the sediment can be remineralized into the reactive form. [...] Sediments are generally richer in phosphorus than lake water, however, indicating that this nutrient may have a long residency time there before it is remineralized and re-introduced to the system.|$|E

40|$|Global {{increases}} {{in the rate of}} <b>atmospheric</b> nitrogen <b>deposition</b> have the potential to alter the composition and function of soil microbial communities. In a long-term field study simulating future rates of <b>atmospheric</b> N <b>deposition,</b> plant litter decay has slowed and soil organic matter has accumulated in conjunction with a decline in both lignolytic enzyme activity and expression of fungal lignolytic genes. Here, I tested the hypothesis that simulated <b>atmospheric</b> N <b>deposition</b> would alter the composition of basidiomycete and ascomycete fungal communities, which may underlie the previously observed biogeochemical responses. The actively metabolizing forest floor fungal community was characterized from cDNA clone libraries constructed from 28 S fungal rRNA extracted from the forest floor of two northern hardwoods stands in the lower peninsula of Michigan, USA. The active basidiomycete communities under ambient and simulated <b>atmospheric</b> N <b>deposition</b> differed significantly in terms of membership and the dispersion of members over a phylogenetic tree. Furthermore, suggestive, albeit nonsignificant, differences in the fraction of unique phylogenetic branch length (the UniFrac metric) between simulated and ambient <b>atmospheric</b> N <b>deposition</b> were observed for basidiomycetes. In contrast, the active ascomycete communities under ambient and simulated <b>atmospheric</b> N <b>deposition</b> did not exhibit significant differences in these same metrics. Collectively, these results indicate that chronic N deposition has altered both the composition and function of litter decaying fungi and that these changes have ecosystem-level implications for the cycling and storage of C in forest ecosystems...|$|R

30|$|Within the {{framework}} of the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution <b>atmospheric</b> <b>depositions</b> of heavy metals and nitrogen as well as critical loads/levels exceedances are mapped yearly with a spatial resolution of 50 [*]km by 50 [*]km. The maps rely on emission data and are calculated by use of atmospheric modelling techniques. For validation, EMEP monitoring data collected at up to 70 sites across Europe are used. This spatially sparse coverage gave reason to test if the chemical and physical relations between <b>atmospheric</b> <b>depositions</b> and their accumulation in mosses collected at up to 7000 sites throughout Europe can be quantified in terms of statistical correlations which, if proven, could be used to calculate deposition maps with a higher spatial resolution. Indeed, combining EMEP maps on <b>atmospheric</b> <b>depositions</b> of cadmium, lead and nitrogen and the related maps of their concentrations in mosses by use of a Regression Kriging approach yielded deposition maps with a spatial resolution of 5 [*]km by 5 [*]km. Since spatial auto-correlation can make testing of statistical inference too liberal, the investigation at hand was to validate the 5 [*]km by 5 [*]km deposition maps by analysing if spatial auto-correlation of both EMEP deposition data and moss data impacted on the significance of their statistical correlation and, thus, the validity of the deposition maps. To this end, two hypotheses were tested: 1. The data on deposition and concentrations in mosses of heavy metals and nitrogen are not spatially auto-correlated significantly. 2. The correlations between the deposition and moss data lack statistical significance due to spatial autocorrelation.|$|R
