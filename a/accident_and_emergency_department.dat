5|$|An anniversary {{service was}} held in Holy Trinity Church Leverstock Green on Sunday, 10 December 2006, at which the Bishop of St Albans spoke, calling again for a full public inquiry, for assurances that the local {{hospital}} would maintain its <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>department,</b> and for the community to continue to build on good relationships formed because of the blast.|$|E
25|$|Casualty is {{a long-running}} British BBC {{television}} series (1986–present), depicting the fictional Holby City Hospital's <b>Accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>Department,</b> {{and the related}} paramedics. Casualty has inspired the spin-off series, Holby City, {{and a number of}} made-for-television films.|$|E
25|$|On 27 July 2015, the <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>department</b> at Manchester Royal Infirmary closed {{after two}} {{patients}} were treated for suspected MERS virus. The facility was reopened later that evening, {{and it was}} later confirmed by Public Health England that the two patients had in fact tested negative for the disease.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} {{the distribution and}} scope of nurse practitioner schemes in <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> in England <b>and</b> Wales; to describe the caseloads of doctors and nurse practitioners on two representative days; and to estimate {{the number of patients}} managed by nurse practitioners in the year to 31 March 1991. DESIGN [...] A postal survey of <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> <b>and</b> a content analysis of case notes of new patients attending a representative sample of <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> on two days. SETTING [...] All <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> in England <b>and</b> Wales. PARTICIPANTS [...] Survey: 560 nurses in charge of <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>departments.</b> Census: case notes of 5814 patients in 37 <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>departments.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Survey: number of <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> with nurse practitioner schemes. Census: demographic and clinical characteristics of new patients attending and whether nurse practitioner or doctor made diagnoses and ordered investigations, treatments, referrals, discharges. RESULTS [...] 513 replies (92 %) from 465 surveyed functioning <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> <b>and</b> 48 departments recently closed. 27 (6 %) departments used designated nurse practitioners and 159 (34 %) "unofficial" nurse practitioners. Only 530 (9 %) of the 5814 patients in the census were managed entirely or mainly by nurse practitioners, with higher proportions in ophthalmic departments (nearly 30 %) and minor casualty departments (over 40 %) than in major departments (3 %). Most patients managed by nurse practitioners (86 %) had minor trauma. In the year ending 31 March 1991 an estimated 390, 000 (95 % confidence interval 260, 000 to 520, 000) patients {{out of a total of}} 12. 5 million (3. 1 %, 2. 1 % to 4. 1 %) were clinically managed by a nurse practitioner. CONCLUSIONS [...] Designated nurse practitioner schemes are rare. The volume and range of nurse practitioner work in major general <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> is small compared with those in specialised <b>and</b> minor <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>departments...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{adequate}} {{management of}} severe pain in <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> depends on {{knowledge of the}} pharmacology of analgesic drugs. To evaluate such a knowledge a study by questionnaire was conducted. Fourteen <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> participated <b>and</b> one hundred senior house officers answered the questionnaire. A {{large percentage of the}} respondents would use an inappropriate route of administration (intramuscular 50 % rather than intrave-nous 50 %), some would use an inappropriate drug and often wait too long (90 min) before giving a further dose of analgesic should the patient continue to be in severe pain after the initial dose. These results suggest that (a) there is need for further teaching on pain relief at medical schools, (b) casualty officers need to be taught about analgesia when they start working in <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>departments,</b> <b>and</b> (c) it may be beneficial for <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> to have an analgesic policy...|$|R

25|$|The George Eliot Hospital {{opened in}} 1948. The Manor Hospital, {{located in the}} centre of Nuneaton, {{retained}} the town’s <b>Accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>Department,</b> operating theatres and orthopaedic wards until they were moved to the George Eliot Hospital in 1993. The Manor Hospital closed on 20 July 1993 and has since turned into a doctor's surgery.|$|E
25|$|Healthcare is {{supplied}} {{in the area}} by NHS Tayside. Ninewells Hospital, is the only hospital with an <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>department</b> in the area.

Dundee is also served by the East Central Region of the Scottish Ambulance Service which covers the city, Tayside and Kingdom of Fife. There is one ambulance station for the city; on West School Road.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} healthcare, Chesterfield has two NHS hospitals, Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in Calow, with {{maternity}} services and <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>department,</b> {{and the smaller}} Walton Hospital run by Derbyshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust. In 1984, the entire site of the old Chesterfield Royal Hospital in the town centre was purchased by an orthopaedic surgeon, who converted the lower portion of the hospital, adjoining Infirmary Road and Durrant Road, into the Alexandra Private Hospital.|$|E
40|$|The Paddington Alcohol Test, {{designed}} {{to screen for}} alcohol related problems amongst those attending <b>Accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>Departments,</b> is presented in a slightly modified form. It concords fairly well with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), but can be administered in about one fifth of the time taken to administer AUDIT. Its scoring of units is rapid and specific to the UK. PAT is recommended for use in UK <b>Accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>Departments...</b>|$|R

The second man, Bilal Abdullah, was initially held at nearby Govan police station, one of the UK's high security police stations with the capability to hold terrorist suspects. He was later transferred to Paddington Green Police Station in London, along with two unnamed suspects, after the Lord Advocate Elish Angiolini gave her consent to a combined prosecution in England under English law.|$|E

40|$|To {{find the}} {{incidence}} of {{the various types of}} head injury that occur in the community separate yearly rates (per 10 (5) population in Scotland) for deaths, admissions to hospital, <b>and</b> attendance at <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> were estimated <b>and</b> compared (when possible) with rates in England and Wales and the United States. Hospital admissions provide the best data for comparing incidences in different geographical areas and rates of attendance at <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> the most reliable guide to incidences in the community. Admission rates, however, vary with local facilities and policies, and these also determine the proportion of patients referred to regional neurosurgical units. Such epidemiological data must be sought both for planning health care for head injury and for monitoring the effectiveness of services...|$|R
25|$|When {{each of the}} West {{children}} {{reached the}} age of seven, they were assigned numerous daily chores to perform within their household; all were very seldom allowed to socialise outside the household perimeters unless either Fred or Rose were present, and all had to follow strict guidelines imposed by their parents, with severe punishment—almost always physical—being the penalty for not conforming to the household rules. Each lived in fear of being the recipients of violence from their parents, and although this violence was occasionally inflicted by Fred, the vast majority of this violence was inflicted by Rose for any real or imagined breach of conformity. Occasionally, the violence was irrational, indiscreet or even inflicted for Rose's simple gratification (although Rose would always take great care not to mark the children's faces or hands in these assaults). Both Heather, then her younger brother Stephen (b. 1973), are known to have run away from home, although both children returned to Cromwell Street after several weeks of alternately sleeping rough or staying with friends. Both were beaten when they returned home. Between 1972 and 1992, the West children were admitted to the <b>Accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>department</b> of local hospitals 31 times; the injuries were explained as accidents and never reported to social services.|$|E

500|$|Runcorn's {{hospital}} is Halton General Hospital, which {{is administered by}} the Warrington and Halton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Originally planned as a District General Hospital, it was never large enough to provide a full range of services. Acute medical services have been transferred to Warrington Hospital and Halton General has become a centre for non-emergency surgery and rehabilitation. Although it never had its own <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>department</b> the hospital has a minor injuries unit for basic emergency care. On the same site is the Cheshire and Merseyside NHS Treatment Centre, a purpose-built hospital for orthopaedic surgery. [...] Halton Haven Hospice is in the Murdishaw area of the town. The body responsible for planning health services in Runcorn, including primary care, is the Halton Clinical Commissioning Group.|$|E
500|$|Health care is {{supplied}} by NHS Fife, {{who have their}} main headquarters in the town at Hayfield House. The Victoria Hospital which is situated north of the town centre, is the town's acute general and maternity hospital. A [...] new £152.5million [...] extension to the hospital was completed in February 2012. This new wing contains a maternity unit, children's department, eleven operating theatres and a new <b>Accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>Department.</b> Within {{the grounds of the}} hospital, a Maggie's Centre, under the name of Maggie's Fife, specialises in care for cancer patients.

2500|$|State {{healthcare}} {{is provided}} for in Glossop and District by Tameside and Glossop Clinical Commissioning Group. This NHS trust operates Tameside General Hospital, a foundation hospital, in Ashton-under-Lyne. [...] The Commissioning Group serves two separate communities {{because there are}} no district general hospitals (hospitals with <b>Accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>Department)</b> within the borough of High Peak, and patients would have to travel over 20 miles to another hospital within the county.|$|E

A child with the distinctive clinical features of Panayiotopoulos syndrome, particularly ictus emeticus and lengthy seizures, may not need any investigations other than EEG. However, because approximately 10% to 20% of children with similar seizures may have brain pathology, an MRI may be needed.|$|E
50|$|In June 2014, the Trust was {{described}} as having “one of the worst performing <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> in the country”, which “repeatedly failed to consistently meet the national target of seeing most A&E patients within four hours, and ensure most wait less than 18 weeks for operations” by Monitor (NHS).|$|R
50|$|In the UK, all NHS {{hospital}} trusts have stringent clothing policies, {{and many}} of these specifically forbid wearing the iconic white coat for medical staff, owing to infection control concerns.
