There are subclassifications for each group (see below).|$|E

5|$|The {{greatest}} {{origin of}} costs for society is the long-term care by {{health care professionals}} and particularly institutionalisation, which corresponds to 2/3 of the total costs for society. The cost of living at home is also very high, especially when informal costs for the family, such as caregiving time and caregiver's lost earnings, <b>are</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> account.|$|E
5|$|There are {{significant}} differences in airway anatomy and respiratory physiology between children and adults, and these <b>are</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> careful consideration before performing tracheal intubation of any pediatric patient.

5|$|A {{native of}} Póvoa de Varzim {{is called a}} Poveiro which can be {{rendered}} into English as Povoan. According to the 2001 Census, there were 63,470 inhabitants that year, 38 848 (61.2%) of whom lived in the city. The number goes up to 100,000 if adjacent satellite areas <b>are</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> account, ranking it as the seventh largest independent urban area in Portugal, within a polycentric agglomeration of about 3 million people, ranging from Braga to Porto.|$|E
50|$|The {{compatibility}} of {{mentor and}} mentee {{is a factor}} that should <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> consideration when choosing pairs. Mentors and mentees may benefit from having similar backgrounds, interests and life experiences.

50|$|Five lead {{changes were}} made (consisting of Ned Jarrett, Darel Dieringer, Billy Wade, and Ned Jarrett). After one hour and thirty-two minutes of racing, Billy Wade managed to defeat LeeRoy Yarbrough by six seconds in front of 10,000 live spectators (approximately 24% of the racetrack's modern capacity). The total prize purse handed out for this racing event was $6,395 ($ when {{inflation}} <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> effect); Billy Wade received $1,400 of it ($ when inflation <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> effect) while Lee Petty received a meager $150 ($ when inflation <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> effect).|$|R

5|$|As a first {{approximation}} {{only the}} inert gasses <b>are</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> account. For oxygen partial pressures above 2.4 bar, {{the quantity of}} oxygen dissolved in the arterial blood exceeds the amount that the body can use, and the hemoglobin is saturated with oxygen in both the veins and the arteries. If more oxygen is added, the partial pressure of oxygen in the venous blood rises.|$|E
5|$|In animals, vacuoles {{serve in}} {{exocytosis}} and endocytosis processes. Endocytosis refers to when substances <b>are</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> the cell, whereas for exocytosis substances are {{moved from the}} cell into the extracellular space. Material to be taken-in is surrounded by the plasma membrane, and then transferred to a vacuole. There {{are two types of}} endocytosis, phagocytosis (cell eating) and pinocytosis (cell drinking). In phagocytosis, cells engulf large particles such as bacteria. Pinocytosis is the same process, except the substances being ingested are in the fluid form.|$|E
5|$|In {{many modern}} Islamist movements, {{women have been}} relegated to a {{domestic}} role. Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook {{during the course of}} da'wa tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household. Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement, but their opinions <b>are</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> due considerations.|$|E

5|$|Kevin's code is {{revealed}} {{to be part of}} a Defense Department satellite transmission. NSA agents ransack the Morris household, looking for any other documentation that might supposedly compromise national security. After the Morrises <b>are</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> custody (which causes Darlene to lose her trust towards Mulder and Scully), Mulder examines the charred roof of their RV, prompting him to head to Lake Okobogee. There, the agents discover sand turned to glass and a burned tree line, indicating the presence of a massive heat source. Upon encountering some white wolves, Mulder and Scully find Greg Randall's body in a shallow grave.|$|E

When his S.H.I.E.L.D. monitor, Agent Quan Chen, discovers him missing the next day, Agent Phil Coulson {{and his team of}} agents are tasked with finding him. Quan reveals that Chan's location and abilities were leaked by the hacktivist group Rising Tide. Skye, a new civilian recruit and S.H.I.E.L.D. trainee, was once a member of the Rising Tide. She traces the hack that released the information back to Miles Lydon, her secret boyfriend and Rising Tide contact. The team goes to confront Lydon, but Skye reaches him first; the two are caught together by Agent Melinda May and <b>are</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.|$|E
5|$|In an {{alternative}} scenario, the exozodiacal dust may be generated in an outer belt that is orbiting between 55 and 90AU from Epsilon Eridani {{and has an}} assumed mass of 10−3 times the mass of Earth. This dust is then transported inward past the orbit of Epsilon Eridani b. When collisions between the dust grains <b>are</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> account, the dust will reproduce the observed infrared spectrum and brightness. Outside the radius of ice sublimation, located beyond 10AU from Epsilon Eridani where the temperatures fall below 100K, the best fit to the observations occurs when a mix of ice and silicate dust is assumed. Inside this radius, the dust must consist of silicate grains that lack volatiles.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the end of}} the {{original}} Hawaii Five-O series, there had been a number of attempts to create a remake, but ultimately none went beyond the pilot stage. CBS later hired Lenkov to pitch a pilot story. Kurtzman and Orci were approached; while originally hesitant to participate in the project, they were impressed with Lenkov's pitch. The episode was filmed in March 2010 and took over two weeks to shoot. When the episode became too long certain sequences were cut from the final product, including the funeral scene with Taryn Manning as McGarrett's sister; the character would be introduced in a later episode. Almost 14.2 million Americans viewed the pilot, increasing to 17.59 million when Live+7-day digital video recordings (DVR) <b>are</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> account, and was also considered a ratings success in other countries. Critical reactions were generally positive.|$|E
5|$|Turkey has {{a unitary}} {{structure}} {{in terms of}} administration and this aspect {{is one of the}} most important factors shaping the Turkish public administration. When three powers (executive, legislative and judiciary) <b>are</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> account as the main functions of the state, local administrations have little power. Turkey doesn't have a federal system, and the provinces are subordinate to the central government in Ankara. Local administrations were established to provide services in place and the government is represented by the province governors (vali) and town governors (kaymakam). Other senior public officials are also appointed by the central government instead of the mayors (belediye başkanı) or elected by constituents. Turkish municipalities have local legislative bodies (belediye meclisi) for decision-making on municipal issues.|$|E
5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{forecasts}} {{storm surge}} using the SLOSH model, {{which is an}} abbreviation for Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes. The model is accurate to within 20percent. SLOSH inputs include the central pressure of a tropical cyclone, storm size, the cyclone's forward motion, its track, and maximum sustained winds. Local topography, bay and river orientation, depth of the sea bottom, astronomical tides, {{as well as other}} physical features, <b>are</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> account in a predefined grid referred to as a SLOSH basin. Overlapping SLOSH basins are defined for the southern and eastern coastline of the continental U.S. Some storm simulations use more than one SLOSH basin; for instance, Hurricane Katrina SLOSH model runs used both the Lake Ponchartrain / New Orleans basin, and the Mississippi Sound basin, for the northern Gulf of Mexico landfall. The final output from the model run will display the maximum envelope of water, or MEOW, that occurred at each location.|$|E
