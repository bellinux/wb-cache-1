Some <b>heating</b> <b>plant</b> companies are in private ownership and some remained or were returned back into ownership of towns and villages. The main hypothesis of the bachelor thesis is that <b>heating</b> <b>plant</b> companies are more effective and are reaching better economic results than companies owned by towns and villages. This hypothesis is confirmed with the aid of statistic method of linear regression. Private <b>heating</b> <b>plant</b> companies have in average higher sales on employee, higher return on equity, higher return on sales and also higher share of investments on total revenue. Minor hypothesis saying that towns <b>heating</b> <b>plant</b> will sell <b>heat</b> energy cheaper was disproved...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} innovative {{method of}} an {{artificial neural network}} (ANN) optimization (synthesis) by means of Analytic Programming (AP). New asynchronous implementation of Self-Organizing Migration Algorithm (SOMA), which provides effective increase of AP computing potential, is introduced here for {{time as well as}} original strategy of communication between SOMA and AP that further contribute towards efficiency in search for optimal ANN solution. The whole ANN synthesis algorithm is applied on the real case of <b>heating</b> <b>plant</b> model identification. The <b>heating</b> <b>plant</b> is located in the town of Most, Czech Republic. The method proves itself to be especially effective when formally identified non-neural parts of the <b>heating</b> <b>plant</b> model need to be made more accurate. Asynchronous distribution plays the key role here as the <b>heating</b> <b>plant</b> behavior data has to be acquired from a very large database and therefore learning of ANN may require a lot of computation time...|$|R

The article deals with the research results of air pollution level with solid airborne particles {{in the vicinity of}} local gas-fired <b>heating</b> <b>plants</b> of some districts of Tomsk region. The snow sampling was conducted for the purpose of solid airborne particles extraction from snow cover. The content of 28 chemical elements (heavy metals, rare earth and radioactive elements, aurum, argentum, bromine) in the samples was detected using instrumental neutron activation analysis. The mercury content was determined by the flameless atomic absorption. The results have shown that the dust load value corresponds to low pollution level and 3, 5 times exceeds the background value. It was detected, the content of studied elements exceeds the baseline data, and level of pollution with these elements corresponds to the average pollution level. It is suggested, the income of solid airborne particles containing these elements is connected both with emission of gas-fired <b>heating</b> <b>plant,</b> and local and trans-border sources...|$|R
