5|$|One of six {{predetermined}} origin stories {{begins the}} game, {{depending on the}} player character's race and class. Each story ends with the player being introduced to and leaving with Duncan, the commander of Ferelden's Grey Wardens {{who is trying to}} find new recruits, selecting the player as a potential candidate. The two journey to a fortress in southern Ferelden called Ostagar. There, they join Cailan, the King of Ferelden, and his father-in-law Loghain, a legendary general. The three leaders plan to make <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>against</b> the encroaching Darkspawn before a new Blight overwhelms Ferelden. Duncan senses the influence of an Archdemon, a god-like being hosted in the body of a powerful Dragon that commands the Darkspawn, which makes this the first true Blight in over 400 years. Duncan emphasizes the importance of defeating the Blight before it can gain enough momentum to threaten the rest of Thedas.|$|E
5|$|The {{plot was}} {{revealed}} to the authorities in an anonymous letter sent to William Parker, 4thBaron Monteagle, on 26October 1605. During {{a search of the}} House of Lords at about midnight on 4November 1605, Fawkes was discovered guarding 36barrels of gunpowder—enough to reduce the House of Lords to rubble—and arrested. Most of the conspirators fled from London as they learned of the plot's discovery, trying to enlist support along the way. Several made <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>against</b> the pursuing Sheriff of Worcester and his men at Holbeche House; in the ensuing battle, Catesby was one of those shot and killed. At their trial on 27January 1606, eight of the survivors, including Fawkes, were convicted and sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to other Germanophile mouthpieces, Seara stated {{its support for}} the Central Powers early on, before such financing could occur—even before its patron Cantacuzino decided which side he supported. In the months of strife which preceded the actual war, the Romanian daily published telegrams and concerned commentary {{about the effects of}} nationalism in Central Europe and the Balkans. These accused the Greek Kingdom and Northern Epirote militias of decimating the Aromanian community in Korçë during April 1914, and urged Romanians to express their indignation. A month later, Seara was taking <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>against</b> Romanian irredentism over Transylvania, as analyzed by the Transylvanian Germanophile Ioan Slavici. Slavici's texts scandalized the nationalist press for supporting Vasile Mangra, the pro-Hungarian priest and suspected agent of influence. However, the newspaper was also criticizing the Hungarian authorities for demanding the extradition of university student Măndăchescu. The latter, Seara reported, was wrongly accused of a bomb attack on the Diocese of Hajdúdorog, when the act was more likely attributable to the revolutionist Ilie Cătărău.|$|E
