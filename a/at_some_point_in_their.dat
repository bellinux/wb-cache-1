5|$|About 150 {{million people}} {{developed}} a {{urinary tract infection}} each year. They are more common in women than men. In women, {{they are the most}} common form of bacterial infection. Up to 10% of women have a urinary tract infection in a given year and half of women having at least one infection <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> lives. They occur most frequently between the ages of 16 and 35years. Recurrences are common. Urinary tract infections have been described since ancient times with the first documented description in the Ebers Papyrus dated to c. 1550 BC.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 9 to 12% {{of people}} (632million) have LBP {{at any given}} point in time, and nearly 25% report having it at some point over any one-month period.

5|$|Gout affects around 1–2% of the Western {{population}} <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> lifetimes and {{is becoming}} more common. Some 5.8 million people were affected in 2013. Rates of gout approximately doubled between 1990 and 2010. This rise {{is believed to be}} due to increasing life expectancy, changes in diet and an increase in diseases associated with gout, such as metabolic syndrome and high blood pressure. Factors that influence rates of gout, include age, race and the season of the year. In men over 30 and women over 50, rates are 2%.|$|E

Many Finnhorses have multiple uses, such as starting their career in harness racing and later moving on to riding. Finnhorses perform both at their own competitions and in open, all-breed classes in dressage, show jumping, and eventing. They are also used for endurance riding, western riding and combined driving. Approximately 1,000 Finnhorses are used in riding schools and in riding therapy. They are also popular as pleasure horses.|$|E

5|$|To the south, the White Salmon River has {{its source}} {{on the lower}} flanks of {{the west side of}} Adams and gains {{additional}} flows from streams along the southwest side of the mountain. Streams on the east side all flow to the Klickitat River. Streams on all sides, <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> courses, provide essential irrigation water for farming and ranching. The Klickitat and White Salmon rivers are nearly completely free flowing, with only small barriers to aid irrigation (White Salmon) and erosion control (Klickitat). The Cispus and Lewis rivers have been impounded with dams farther downstream for flood control and power generation purposes.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> history, {{not clearly}} documented, horses bred {{in the western}} regions {{crossbred}} with horses that originated south of the Gulf of Finland. This made the western Finnish horse type larger and better suited to farming and forestry work. The characteristics of the original western Finnish type prevailed, however, even though influenced by outside blood and traces of outside influence could be detected for a long time. Later, this mixed type was further crossbred with larger horses from Central Europe during the Middle Ages. Foreign horses were also brought to Finland during military campaigns, and additional animals were imported to manor houses for driving. The crossbreed offspring of Central European and Finnish horses were larger than their Finnish parents, and even more suited for agricultural work.|$|E
5|$|Cavaliers can notably {{suffer from}} mitral valve disease, {{which leads to}} heart failure. This appears in many Cavaliers <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> lives and {{is the most common}} cause of death. Some serious genetic health problems, {{including}} early-onset mitral valve disease (MVD), the potentially severely painful syringomyelia (SM), hip dysplasia, luxating patellas, and certain vision and hearing disorders are health problems for this breed. As today's Cavaliers all descend from only six dogs, any inheritable disease present in at least one of the original founding dogs can be passed on to a significant proportion of future generations. This is known as the founder effect and is the likely cause of the prevalence of MVD in the breed. The health problems shared with this breed include mitral valve disease, luxating patella, and hereditary eye issues such as cataracts and retinal dysplasia.|$|E

5|$|However, Psittacosaurus may {{not have}} been entirely bipedal for its entire lifespan. Taking {{sections}} from the limb bones of 16 specimens of Psittacosaurus, ranging in age from less than a year old to ten-year old adults, Qi Zhao from the University of Bristol found that Psittacosaurus was probably secondarily bipedal. The infants' front limbs grew at faster rates than the hind limbs at between birth and three years of age. At the age of between four and six years, arm growth slowed and leg growth accelerated as the animal became mature. At this stage, Psittacosaurs would switch to a bipedal stance. These findings further reveal that the ancestor of Psittacosaurus was likely quadrupedal and eventually gained the ability to become bipedal as it evolved, with the young retaining the quadrupedal gait of the ancestor in question. These findings also lead to the hypothesis that many such dinosaur families may have evolved along this path <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> evolution.|$|E
5|$|Many Western Catholics have voiced {{significant}} {{disagreement with}} the Church's teaching on contraception. Catholics for Choice, a political lobbyist group which is not associated with the Catholic Church, stated in 1998 that 96% of U.S. Catholic women had used contraceptives <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> lives and that 72% of Catholics believed that one {{could be a good}} Catholic without obeying the Church's teaching on birth control. Use of natural family planning methods among United States Catholics purportedly is low, although the number cannot be known with certainty. As Catholic health providers are among the largest providers of services to patients with HIV/AIDS worldwide, there is significant controversy within and outside the church regarding the use of condoms as a means of limiting new infections, as condom use ordinarily constitutes prohibited contraceptive use.|$|E
5|$|The {{crystallization}} of uric acid, often {{related to}} relatively high {{levels in the}} blood, is the underlying cause of gout. This can occur because of diet, genetic predisposition, or underexcretion of urate, the salts of uric acid. Underexcretion of uric acid by the kidney is {{the primary cause of}} hyperuricemia in about 90% of cases, while overproduction is the cause in less than 10%. About 10% of people with hyperuricemia develop gout <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> lifetimes. The risk, however, varies depending on the degree of hyperuricemia. When levels are between 415 and 530μmol/l (7 and 8.9mg/dl), the risk is 0.5% per year, while in those with a level greater than 535μmol/l (9mg/dL), the risk is 4.5% per year.|$|E

5|$|The exarchs of Africa were {{effectively}} Governor-Generals {{with both}} {{civilian and military}} powers. Their seat of power was Carthage. Historians of the late 19th and early 20th centuries ascribed much significance to this appointment, even suggesting it would require prominent ties of Heraclius the Elder to Africa or the wider Western Roman Empire. Later historians pointed, however, that this appointment {{was part of a}} wider pattern. In the 6th century, several prominent Byzantine military commanders had started their careers in the eastern regions of the Empire, often in the vicinity of Upper Mesopotamia. Then they were transferred to North Africa <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> respective careers. There is therefore no indication that this rotation from the eastern to the western provinces was unusual.|$|E
5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} the most {{frequent}} bacterial infection in women. They occur most frequently {{between the ages of}} 16 and 35years, with 10% of women getting an infection yearly and more than 40–60% having an infection <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> lives. Recurrences are common, with nearly half of people getting a second infection within a year. Urinary tract infections occur four times more frequently in females than males. Pyelonephritis occurs between 20–30 times less frequently. They {{are the most}} common cause of hospital acquired infections accounting for approximately 40%. Rates of asymptomatic bacteria in the urine increase with age from two to seven percent in women of child bearing age to as high as 50% in elderly women in care homes. Rates of asymptomatic bacteria in the urine among men over 75 are between 7-10%. Asymptomatic bacteria in the urine occurs in 2% to 10% of pregnancies.|$|E
5|$|All {{vertebrates}} have {{a similar}} basic body plan and <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> lives, mostly in the embryonic stage, share the major chordate characteristics; a stiffening rod, the notochord; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the neural tube; pharyngeal arches; and a tail posterior to the anus. The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it. Nervous tissue {{is derived from the}} ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from mesoderm, and gut is derived from the endoderm. At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus {{at the base of the}} tail. The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae. In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. However, a few vertebrates, such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood. Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.|$|E
