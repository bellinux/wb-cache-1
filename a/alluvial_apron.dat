40|$|We {{investigate}} the routing and transfer of {{particulate organic carbon}} (POC) from the western Southern Alps, New Zealand, using organic carbon (Corg) and nitrogen (Norg) concentrations and stable carbon isotopes (δ¹³Corg). In this active mountain belt, sediment discharge is dominated by landslide-derived material. Landsliding acts to homogenize the geochemically diverse hillslope POC, mixing POC from the standing biomass and soil with the fossil POC from bedrock. As a result, the POC in river sediment at the mountain front is a binary mixture of fossil and nonfossil carbon sourced from many landslide deposits. We calculate that nonfossil biogenic POC makes up 63 ± 7 % of the total POC in the suspended load of rivers draining the western Southern Alps. The erosional flux of biogenic POC from these catchments represents a transfer of 39 tC km-² a-¹ of atmospheric CO₂ averaged over the west flank of the mountain belt. If more than 10 % of this POC is preserved in sediments on geological timescales, then this process {{is the most significant}} way in which the Southern Alps and similar, tectonically active mountain belts with restricted <b>alluvial</b> <b>aprons</b> consume atmospheric CO₂...|$|R
40|$|The Almy {{sandy loam}} mapping unit {{consists}} of very deep, well drained soils that developed in alluvium on <b>alluvial</b> fan <b>aprons</b> and fan piedmonts. It occurs at elevation ranges from 6, 800 feet to 7, 400 feet. The {{mean annual precipitation}} {{is estimated to be}} 8 to 10 inches. The mean annual air temperature is approximately 38 degrees Fahrenheit. The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 100 days. Slopes are both simple and complex and range from 0 to 15 percent. Parent materials are weathered from interbedded, red, fine sandstone and shale. Permeability within the Almy soil is moderate or moderately slow. Runoff is slow on the gentler slopes and medium on the steeper slopes, and the water erosion hazard is severe. The hazard of wind erosion is moderate...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} of the Broadmarsh-Elderslie area is very largely {{controlled by}} lithology and structure - variations in topography, st. re am pattern, and valley and channel morphology are {{shown to be}} closely related to bedrock changes. Hillslope morphology is examined in detail. Dolerite slopes decline by extending basal slopes with accumulated debris eroded from the summit sections. Differential protection by vegetation is held {{to be the main}} reason for the differences in form and rate of erosion on north - and southfacing slopes. Alluvial terraces can be correlated only within individual segments of the valley producing a 'ponded' effect. When casually observed in the field, the channel of the Jordan River is a picture of disorder. To the contrary, an analysis of width-depth ratios reveals no significant variations in channel form. Large valley meanders, extensive <b>alluvial</b> fans and <b>aprons,</b> and aeolian deposits provide evidence of marked variations in former climatic conditions...|$|R

40|$|The heavy {{minerals}} of the Citronelle Formation and fluviatite terraces of Louisiana were examined {{to determine the}} source of these sediments. Examination of samples indicates that an East Gulf Province heavy mineral suite (kyanite, staurolite, zircon, tourmaline), typical of the Cretaceous and Tertiary sediments of the Gulf tC~astal Province is present throughout he Citronelle and older Louisiana terrace deposits. A Mississippi River province suite (epldote, dolomite, amphibole-pyroxene, garnet), presumably derived from the glacial deposits of the northern United States, {{is present in the}} younger Louisiana terrace deposits: the Holloway Praire, Port Hickey, and Irene. Based on previous work and heavy mineral and mechanical analysis data determined in this report, the Citronelle Formation appears to represent an <b>alluvial</b> <b>apron</b> formed by coalescing, braiding streams, in response to epeirogenic uplift of the continental interior during Late Pliocene to preglacial Pleistocene time. Encisement of the Mississippi River and other streams into Citronelle sediments has resulted in entrenched valleys containing fluviatile terraces which are mlneralogically and lithologically similar to the Citronelle but are at lower elevations. Younger terrace deposits bearing a Mississippi River province heavy mineral suite are believed to have formed in response to fluctuating sea level during the Pleistocene...|$|E
40|$|We present ground-penetrating radar {{data from}} the {{footwall}} region of the Western Eliki Fault, a normal fault on the southern shores of the Gulf of Corinth, Greece. The fault bounds {{the southern edge of}} the Eliki Plain, the site of repeated destructive earthquakes, most notably in 373 BC, 1861 AD and 1995 AD. A number of linear scarps, suggestive of recent tectonic disturbance, were identified from aerial photographs cutting an <b>alluvial</b> fan <b>apron,</b> the Nikolaiika Fan, at the eastern end of the Western Eliki Fault. In the field, the Nikolaiika Fan scarps are 0. 5 - 1. 0 m high morphological steps. These steps generally coincide with, and are indistinguishable from, the risers of agricultural terraces. To assess the likelihood of a tectonic origin, GPR common offset surveys were collected on three roads crossing the fan surface and running perpendicular to the scarps. Surveys were conducted using a pulseEKKO 100 with 50, 100 and 200 MHz antennae. GPR profiles reveal offset reflections, possible warping of reflections between offsets and regions of scattering beneath suspected fault zones, indicating that a number of surficial scarps are the surface expressions of faulting. Offsets are visible throughout the GPR profiles in sediments deposited in the last few thousand years, confirming late Holocene activity on the Western Eliki Fault. The profiles indicate that fault activity may not be confined to the main escarpment footwall, suggesting activity in the uppermost hanging-wall sediments...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{studied the}} patterns, rates and {{evolution}} of fluvial terraces and fault system during the building process of an intracontinental transpressional mountain in the Gobi-Altay (Mongolia). By analyzing incisions and offsets of fluvial terraces and alluvial fans, we show that the massif has grown by outward migration of thrust faults through time. On the northern flank, the present bounding thrust fault began its activity ~ 600 ka ago, while a more internal sub-parallel fault was still active until ~ 200 - 100 ka. Vertical offset of an alluvial fan abandoned ~ 100 ka ago allows an estimate of 0. 1 mm/yr Upper Pleistocene - Holocene uplift rate. The morphology of the catchment-piedmont system strongly suggests a periodical formation of the alluvial surfaces, controlled by the climatic pulses, {{at the beginning of}} the wet interglacial periods. The abandonment of the alluvial terraces lags by several thousand years the abandonment of the alluvial fans, showing a diachronous incision propagating upstream. The incision rate deduced from the different elevations of straths exceeds of one order of magnitude the rock uplift rate. This excess is mostly due to ongoing drainage network growth at the core of the massif, and incision due to <b>alluvial</b> <b>apron</b> entrenchment near the outlet. This implies that fluvial response is mainly controlled by drainage growth, interaction with piedmont and cyclic climatic variations, rather than by rock uplift...|$|E
40|$|Blackhawk Mountain, a {{resistant}} mass {{of marble}} thrust northward over uncemented sandstone and weathered gneiss, rises above southeastern Lucerne Valley {{at the eastern}} end of the rugged 4000 -foot escarpment that separates the San Bernardino Mountains on the south from the Mojave Desert on the north. Spread out on the <b>alluvial</b> <b>apron</b> {{at the foot of the}} mountain is the Blackhawk rockslide, a lobe of nearly monolithologic marble breccia 30 to 100 feet thick, 2 miles wide, and nearly 5 miles long. At least two earlier similar but smaller rockslides have occurred in the area. The rocks of the area comprise late Tertiary and Quaternary fanglomerates and breccias derived mainly from the gneiss, quartzite, Carboniferous marble, and Cretaceous quartz-monzonite of the San Bernardino Mountains. Uplift of Blackhawk Mountain occurred in two stages after deposition of the older fanglomerates and breccias: the first by over-thrusting from the south, and the second by monoclinal folding along a northwest-trending axis. Geological evidence in the area shows that the Blackhawk rockslide traversed the gently inclined alluvial slope as a nearly nondeforming sheet of breccia moving more than 50 miles per hour. The hypothesis that compressed air, rather than water or mud, constituted the lubricating layer on which the breccia sheet slid qualitatively explains all of the principal physical features of the slide lobe. Theoretical analysis of the flow in the lubricating air layer indicates the quantitative feasibility of the air-lubrication hypothesis for the Blackhawk slide...|$|E
40|$|The Marsokhod rover {{returned}} {{data from}} six stations {{that were used}} to decipher the geomorphology and geology of a region not previously visited by members of the geomorphology field team. Satellite images and simulated descent images provided information about the regional setting. The landing zone was on an <b>alluvial</b> <b>apron</b> flanking a mountain block to the west and a playa surface to the east. Rover color images, infrared spectra analysis of the mountains, and the apron surface provided insight into the rock composition of the nearby mountains. From the return data the geomorphology team interpreted the region to consist of compressionally deformed, ancient marine sediments and igneous rocks exposed by more recent extensional tectonics. Unconsolidated alluvial materials blanket the lower flanks of the mountains. An ancient shoreline cut into alluvial material marks a high stand of water during a past, wetter climate period. Playa sediments floor a present-day, seasonally, dry lake. Observations made by the rover using panoramic and close-up (hand specimens-scale) image data and color scene data confirmed the presence of boulders, cobbles, and fines of various provinces. Rover traverses to sites identified as geologically distinct, such as fan, channel, shoreline, and playa, provided useful clues to the geologic interpretations. Analysis of local rocks was given context only through comparison with distant geologic features. These results demonstrated the importance of a multifaceted approach to site interpretation through comparison of interpretations derived by differing geologic techniques.

40|$|The Soledad basin is {{situated}} {{north of the}} San Gabriel Mountains, in Los Angeles County, California, and its center is about 35 {{miles north of the}} Los Angeles civic center. Roughly an elongate parallelogram in shape, this basin has dimensions of about ten by thirty miles, with the longer dimension oriented east-west. The Sierra Pelona and the San Gabriel Mountains form the northern and southern boundaries, respectively. The San Andreas fault and the San Gabriel fault, both of which trend northwest in this region, bound the basin on its northeast and southwest borders, respectively. Only {{the northern part of the}} basin is discussed in this paper. The pre-Cretaceous Pelona schist, the oldest unit in the map area, is a thick sequence of muscovite schist, chlorite-muscovite schist and actinolite-chlorite schist with rare layers of quartzite and limestone. This unit underlies the Sierra Pelona, an elongate mountain mass which trends east-west. Granitic intrusive rocks of probable late Jurassic age underlie a complex section of Tertiary rocks in most of the eastern Soledad basin. Gneisses, some of which may represent highly injected Pelona schist, also are present in a belt that in general trends parallel to the Sierra Pelona. In general, the sedimentary beds exposed at the surface are younger from east to west in the Soledad basin. The marine Martinez formation of Paleocene age is the oldest sedimentary unit in the region. It is overlain by the Vasquez series which crops out over a wide area, and comprises interlayered fanglomerates and volcanic rocks. Where the Martinez formation has been removed by erosion prior to the deposition of the Vasquez beds, the Vasquez series rests on the pre-Tertiary crystalline rocks. This unit is of doubtful Oligocene age, and has a maximum known thickness of nearly 16, 000 feet. The Vasquez beds were deposited in three basins separated by ridges. Late in Vasquez time, these ridges were buried by thick alluvial fans built northward from the San Gabriel Mountains, and the basins thus coalesced into a single broad <b>alluvial</b> <b>apron.</b> The upper Lower Miocene Tick Canyon formation and the Upper Miocene Mint Canyon formation, which lie above the Vasquez series, also represent nonmarine deposition of dominantly coarse-grained sedimentary material. These units are widespread in the western part of the Soledad basin. Sandstone and siltstone of the "Modelo" formation rest unconformably on the Mint Canyon beds, and reflect an eastward encroachment of marine waters over a part of the basin in late Miocene time. West of the map area, the marine Pliocene Pico formation and the nonmarine Plio-Pleistocene Saugus formation, which grades westward into a marine facies, overlie the older rocks. Terrace deposits of late Pleistocene age are common over much of the area. Recent alluvium is present in all of the major valley bottoms and locally in some of the minor valleys. The date of the folding and metamorphism of the Pelona schist is not known, but it assuredly is pre-Tertiary. Tertiary rocks have been either tilted or deformed into broad open folds, although locally near the major faults nearly isoclinal folds are found. Almost without exception, these folds plunge to the west or southwest. The numerous faults are the most prominent structural features of the Soledad basin. Normal faults which trend generally east were formed in post-Martinez, pre-Vasquez time. Displacements occurred throughout Vasquez time and ceased prior to Tick Canyon time. The Pelona fault may have been reactivated just prior to Mint Canyon time. Offsets on these normal faults are as much as 10, 000 to 15, 000 feet. The normal faults indicate that the minimum compressive stress was oriented nearly north-south. Can the other hand, the post-Mint Canyon, pre-Saugus faults indicate a maximum compressive stress oriented north-south, which resulted in a number. of northeast-trending left-hand faults with displacements up to 10, 000 feet. None of the faults of the Soledad basin have been reactivated in spite of Pleistocene and Recent offsets along the San Andreas fault...|$|E
