500|$|In {{reply to}} a {{question}} in 1996 about his religious beliefs, Carl Sagan answered, [...] "I'm agnostic." [...] Sagan maintained {{that the idea of}} a creator God of the Universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could challenge it would be an infinitely old universe. Sagan's views on religion have been interpreted as a form of pantheism comparable to Einstein's belief in Spinoza's God. His son, Dorion Sagan said, [...] "My father believed in the God of Spinoza and Einstein, God not behind nature but as nature, equivalent to it." [...] His last wife, Ann Druyan, stated: When my husband died, because he was so famous and known for not being a believer, many people would come up to me—it still sometimes happens—and <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> Carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife. They also frequently <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I think I will see him again. Carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions. The tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again. I don't ever expect to be reunited with Carl.|$|E
500|$|Astronaut Buzz Aldrin {{called the}} visual effects [...] "remarkable", and said, [...] "I was so extravagantly {{impressed}} by the portrayal {{of the reality of}} zero gravity. Going through the space station was done just the way that I've seen people do it in reality. The spinning is going to happen—maybe not quite that vigorous—but certainly we've been fortunate that people haven't been in those situations yet. I think it reminds us that there really are hazards in the space business, especially in activities outside the spacecraft." [...] Former NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman said, [...] "The pace and story was definitely engaging and I think it was the best use of the 3-D IMAX medium to date. Rather than using the medium as a gimmick, Gravity uses it to depict a real environment that is completely alien to most people. But the question that most people want me to answer is, how realistic was it? The very fact that the question is being asked so earnestly {{is a testament to the}} verisimilitude of the movie. When a bad science fiction movie comes out, no one bothers to <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> it reminded me of the real thing." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Jacqui {{embarked}} on a [...] "surprise" [...] relationship with Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss). Moss first hinted at their romance months prior stating: [...] "I think Rhys is going {{to fall in love}} again. It's a character already in the village. It's quite surprising. It's a character who's been here for a while." [...] The relationship proved popular with viewers; during an interview with Digital Spy, Cooper spoke of her original lack of optimism towards the pairing, stating: [...] "When the relationship first started, we didn't know how they were going to gel and how it was going to work, because people were such fans of Jacqui and Tony. Some people still <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> those two are going to get back together, but people are really taken with Rhys and Jacqui." [...] Cooper believes it's her own working relationship with Moss that helps make the pairing a success stating: [...] "It's a nice collaboration and we try to make it funny, emotional, hard-hitting, three-dimensional and as interesting for the audience as possible." [...] She also adopted a [...] "couple name" [...] for the pair titled [...] "Ja-Rhys".|$|E

The Beacon, the student newspaper for the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, recounted a portion of Irwin’s performance:'Someone <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I smoke,' said Irwin. The audience complied. Then he whistled without taking a breath for over a minute. After which he answered with a sly 'No.' ...|$|E

2500|$|When Newman {{died there}} {{appeared}} in a monthly magazine a series of very unflattering sketches by one who had lived under his roof. I ventured to ask Cardinal Manning if he had seen these sketches. He replied that he had and thought them very shocking; the writer must have a very unenviable mind, , and then, having thus sacrificed to propriety, after a moment's pause he added: [...] "But if you <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> they are like poor Newman, I am bound to say – a photograph." ...|$|E
2500|$|Players and {{developers}} use games {{to express their}} existential and spiritual feelings. Video games as cultural objects can also provide religious and spiritual experiences, like Journey (2012). Developer Jenova Chen said that [...] "I feel that Journey is a very spiritual game. People {{from around the world}} <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> the game has a religious connection. Many religions share an affinity with Journey—this is because many religions partly share a common structure". Chen said Journey is based upon Joseph Campbell's book on comparative mythology The Hero with a Thousand Faces and the [...] "Hero's Journey" [...] narrative structure.|$|E
2500|$|Romney said of {{the measure}} overall, [...] "There really wasn't Republican or Democrat in this. People <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> this is {{conservative}} or liberal, and my answer is yes. It's liberal {{in the sense that}} we're getting our citizens health insurance. It's conservative in that we're not getting a government takeover." [...] The law was {{the first of its kind}} in the nation and became the signature achievement of Romney's term in office. [...] When Romney's official portrait was made for the Massachusetts State House, the composition included a leather binder with a medical seal representing the healthcare legislation.|$|E

2500|$|Originally {{published}} {{under the}} pseudonym [...] "Tex Burns". Louis L'Amour was commissioned to write four Hopalong Cassidy {{books in the}} spring and summer of 1950 by Doubleday's Double D Western imprint. They were the first novels he ever had published and he denied writing them until the day he died, refusing to sign any of them that fans would occasionally bring to his autograph sessions. His reason to his young son for doing this was, [...] "I wrote some books. I just did it for the money, and my name didn't go on them. So now, when people <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> they were mine, I say no." [...] When his son asked if this was not lying he said, [...] "I just wrote them for hire. They weren't my books." ...|$|E
2500|$|Glenn Herbert Gould {{was born}} at home in Toronto on September 25, 1932, to Russell Herbert ("Bert") Gold and Florence ("Flora") Emma Gold (née Greig), Presbyterians of Scottish and English ancestry. His {{maternal}} grandfather was a cousin of Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg (who was himself of Scottish ancestry). The family's surname was changed to Gould informally around 1939 {{in order to avoid}} being mistaken for Jewish, given the prevailing anti-Semitism of prewar Toronto and the Gold surname's Jewish association. Gould had no Jewish ancestry, though he sometimes made jokes on the subject, like [...] "When people <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I'm Jewish, I always tell them that I was Jewish during the war." [...] Gould grew up in a home at 32 Southwood Drive, Toronto. His childhood home has been named a historic site by the City of Toronto.|$|E
2500|$|After his songwriting {{contributions}} {{were rejected}} from the band's previous album, 1986's Somewhere in Time, Dickinson felt that his role within the band had diminished, as he [...] "just became the singer," [...] but felt renewed enthusiasm when Harris explained the concept to him; [...] "I thought, 'What a great idea! Brilliant!' And of course I was really chuffed, too, because he'd actually rung {{me to talk}} about it and <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I had any songs that might fit that sort of theme. I was like, 'Well, no, but give me a minute and I'll see what I can do.'" [...] Speaking about the record in later years, however, Dickinson remarked that [...] "we almost did [...] ", explaining that, [...] "it was only half a concept album. There was no attempt to see it all the way through, like we really should have done. Seventh Son... has no story. It's about good and evil, heaven and hell, but isn't every Iron Maiden record?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Bryant and James [...] {{believed}} the 2012 team would win against the Dream Team, the 1992 Olympic team {{considered by some}} the greatest sports team ever assembled. Bryant said, [...] "hey were a lot older, at kind {{of the end of}} their careers. We have just a bunch of young racehorses, guys that are eager to compete". Dream Team member Charles Barkley said that he [...] "just started laughing" [...] upon hearing Bryant's comment and thought the 1992 team would win by double digits. Michael Jordan added: [...] "For [...] to compare those two teams {{is not one of the}} smarter things he ever could have done... Remember now, they learned from us. We didn't learn from them". Bird joked, [...] "They probably could. I haven't played in 20 years and we're all old now." [...] Bryant later clarified that he thought the 1992 team was better, but it was [...] "ludicrous" [...] to think his team could not beat the Dream Team in one game. [...] "You didn't <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> we could beat them in a 7-game series", he said.|$|E
2500|$|Simon Viklund {{returns as}} the game's {{composer}} for the sequel. [...] The arrangements {{were created in}} Buzz, a freeware virtual studio program. Viklund cited games on the Nintendo Entertainment System as influences for Rearmed 2s music, including the Mega Man series, DuckTales, and Gun.Smoke. [...] When asked {{about the possibility of}} a commercial release to the game's soundtrack, Viklund states [...] "I do encourage those who <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> there will be a BCR2 soundtrack to contact Capcom. Really, it's up to them." [...] A contest was held from July 16, 2010 to August 11, 2010 allowing fans to remix an 8-bit Bionic Commando track for inclusion in the game. [...] On September 14, 2010 two winners were chosen. [...] Their remixes were included in the music for Bionic Commando Rearmed 2. [...] Regarding the winners' arrangements, Viklund stated [...] "What I had to say about the winning submissions was that I think it's a cliché at this point to bring in the electric guitars on interpretations of old NES songs, and yet it’s always nice to hear that (or any) cliché actually done well. Those two guys both did it really well." ...|$|E
