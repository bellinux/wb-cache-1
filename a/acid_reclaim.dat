50|$|Every {{part of each}} UltraBattery - lead, plastic, {{steel and}} acid - is {{virtually}} 100% recyclable for later reuse. Large-scale recycling facilities for these batteries are already available and 96% of lead acid batteries used in the US are recycled. Battery manufacturers recover and separate the lead, plastics and acid from VRLA batteries. The lead is smelted and refined for reuse. Plastic parts are cleaned, ground, extruded and moulded into new plastic parts. The <b>acid</b> is <b>reclaimed,</b> cleaned and used in new batteries.|$|R
50|$|When cultivated, acid sulfate soils {{cannot be}} kept wet {{continuously}} because of climatic dry spells and shortages of irrigation water, surface drainage {{may help to}} remove the acidic and toxic chemicals (formed in the dry spells) during rainy periods. In the long run surface drainage can help to <b>reclaim</b> <b>acid</b> sulfate soils. The indigenous population of Guinea Bissau has thus managed to develop the soils, but it has taken them many years of careful management and toil.|$|R
40|$|Reclaimed mine lands {{have the}} {{potential}} to sequester carbon. The use of amendments to increase fertility and overall soil quality is encouraging. Waste amendments such as sewage sludge and clarifier sludge, as well as commercial compost were tested to determine their effects on carbon sequestration and humic <b>acid</b> formation in <b>reclaimed</b> mine lands. Sewage sludge and clarifier sludge {{have the potential}} to work as reclaimed mine lands amendments. C:N ratios need to be understood to determine probability of nutrient leaching and water contamination. Microbial activity on the humic acid fraction of sludge is directed toward the readily degradable constituents containing single chain functional groups. This finding indicate that amendments with lower molecular constituents such as aliphatic compounds are more amenable to microbial degradation, therefore serves as better nutrient sources to enhance the formation of vegetation in mine lands and leads to more efficient carbon sequestration...|$|R
40|$|From the Proceedings of the 1973 Meetings of the Arizona Section - American Water Resources Assn. and the Hydrology Section - Arizona Academy of Science - May 4 - 5, 1973, Tucson, ArizonaMeasurements of {{penetrability}} and {{hydraulic conductivity}} in calcareous soils {{treated with a}} dilute sulfuric acid solution showed a severe decrease in conductivity with increasing concentrations over 1000 ppm. A slight decrease in penetrability was observed. Carbon dioxide evolution appeared {{to be responsible for}} flow reduction and temporary cessation at 10, 000 ppm and 20, 000 ppm. In sodic soils penetrability and conductivity increased markedly with sulfuric acid concentrations between 1, 000 and 10, 000 ppm. For a neutral soil, penetrability decreased with increasing sulfuric acid concentrations, and the stable conductivity for 500 to 5, 000 ppm was higher than for water alone. The findings suggest that disposal of sulfuric acid concentrations greater than 1, 000 ppm will result in plugging by carbon dioxide. In sodic soils the possibility exists of using sulfuric <b>acid</b> solutions for <b>reclaiming</b> salt and sodium-affected soils...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{practicable}} {{scheme of}} SO 2 -emission permits for European power producers is developed. Background {{is the second}} UN-ECE Sulphur Protocol from 1994 (Protocol of Oslo). After discussing some theoretical models of spatially differentiated permit schemes, evaluating the U. S. <b>Acid</b> Rain and <b>RECLAIM</b> Program, and considering the setting in the EU- 15 countries, a scheme of locally undifferentiated emission permits is proposed which is distinguished by {{a high degree of}} both economic efficiency and market functioning. However, as our model simulations indicate, national deposition targets will be violated in all probability due to the scheme?s missing differentiation regarding the receptors. The risk of hot spots is addressed adequately by a differentiated bundle of countermeasures. The general economic impact of an EU-wide permit scheme is low, and, in terms of change in GDP, lower compared to a non-coordinated SO 2 policy. The proposed mode of the initial permit allocation allows for early price signals and guarantees maximum static and dynamic efficiency. Balancing the interests of existing and new emitters, a long-term transition from the grandfathering to the free auction procedure is chosen. [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Green Technology Group (GTG) {{was awarded}} Grant No. DE-FG 01 - 96 EE 15657 {{in the amount}} of $ 99, 904 for a project to advance GTG`s Pickliq{reg_sign} Process in the Copper and Steel Industries. The use of the Pickliq{reg_sign} Process can {{significantly}} reduce the production of waste acids containing metal salts. The Pickliq{reg_sign} Process can save energy and eliminate hazardous waste in a typical copper rod or wire mill or a typical steel wire mill. The objective of this pilot project was to determine the magnitude of the economic, energy and environmental benefits of the Pickliq{reg_sign} Process in two applications within the metal processing industry. The effectiveness of the process has already been demonstrated at facilities cleaning iron and steel with sulfuric acid. 9207 companies are reported to use sulfuric and hydrochloric acid in the USA. The USEPA TRI statistics of acid not recycled in the US is 2. 4 x 10 {sup 9 } lbs (net) for Hydrochloric Acid and 2. 0 x 10 {sup 9 } lbs (net) for Sulfuric Acid. The energy cost of not <b>reclaiming</b> <b>acid</b> is 10. 7 x 10 {sup 6 } BTU/ton for Hydrochloric Acid and 21. 6 x 10 {sup 6 } BTU/Ton for Sulfuric Acid. This means that there is a very large market for the application of the Pickliq{reg_sign} Process and the widespread use of the process will bring significant world wide savings of energy to the environment...|$|R
40|$|Dissolved {{organic matter}} (DOM) in {{reclaimed}} {{water from a}} conventional sewage treatment plant was isolated using resin adsorption chromatography technique into six classes: hydrophobic bases (HoB), hydrophobic acids (HoA), hydrophobic neutrals (HoN), hydrophilic bases (HiB), hydrophilic acids (HiA) and hydrophilic neutrals (HiN). It was found that organic <b>acids</b> dominated in <b>reclaimed</b> water and the ratios Of UV(254) (absorbance at 254 nm) to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (SUVA(254)) ratio exhibited a common relationship: HoA > reclaimed water > HiA. The influences of chemical structures and experimental conditions on the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) were investigated, respectively. SUVA 254 was found to exhibit a positive and statistically significant correlation with DBPs formation potential. The specific trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) formation potential decreased as the same sequence: acids, neutrals and bases. The formation of DBPs depended more {{on a combination of}} aromatic moieties and aliphatic structures such as hydroxy acids. Furthermore, THMs formed more easily at alkaline conditions; however, hydrophobic organics formed HAAs more easily at acidic conditions. whereas hydrophilic organics achieved relatively high HAAs at both acidic and strong alkaline conditions. Moreover, the observed rate constant for HAAs formation was larger than the rate constant for THMs formation. Addition of ammonia nitrogen (NH(4) -N) changed chlorine to chloramines with lower oxidation potential, and correspondingly influenced the formation of DBPs especially at the chlorination breakpoint.

40|$|Background and aims: Faecal {{bile acid}} {{elimination}} greatly contributes to cholesterol homeostasis. Synthesised from cholesterol in the liver, bile <b>acids</b> are actively <b>reclaimed</b> in the ileum by the apical sodium dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT). Although the expression level of ASBT affects body cholesterol balance, {{the impact of}} cholesterol on ASBT gene expression remains unclear. In this study, the effect of cholesterol on ASBT expression and ileal bile acid uptake was explored in vivo and in vitro. Methods: ASBT gene expression was assessed by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and northern or western blotting, or both, in mice subjected to a 2 % cholesterol diet for two weeks, in mouse ileal explants, or in human enterocyte-like Caco- 2 cells cultured in sterol enriched or depleted media. Bile acid uptake was determined by measuring [3 H]-taurocholic acid influx into in situ isolated ileal loops from mice or into differentiated Caco- 2 cells. Molecular analysis of mouse and human ASBT promoters was undertaken with reporter assays, site directed mutagenesis, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Results: In mice, cholesterol enriched diet triggered a downregulation of ASBT expression (mRNA and protein), a fall in ileal bile acid uptake, and {{a rise in the}} faecal excretion of bile acids. This effect was direct as it was reproduced ex vivo using mouse ileal explants and in vitro in differentiated Caco- 2 cells. Conclusions: This regulation, which involves an original partnership between SREBP- 2 and HNF- 1 a transcription factors, affects ileal bile acid recycling and thus might participate in the maintenance of body cholesterol homeostasis...|$|R
40|$|Quantifying {{the process}} and the amount of acid-contaminant {{released}} to the surroundings is important in assessing the environmental hazards associated with <b>reclaiming</b> <b>acid</b> sulphate soils (ASS). The roles of surface runoff and bypass flow (i. e. the rapid downward flow of free water along macropores through an unsaturated soil matrix) in transporting aluminum from three types of raised beds (soil ridges formed by piling up soil materials excavated from adjacent ditches) were studied in a Typic Sulfaquept in Can Tho, Vietnam. During the month of April, 1 h cumulative infiltration of the low raised beds (made only of the topsoil materials) and high raised beds (made of topsoil and jarositic layers) was significantly higher than that of the traditional raised beds (made of topsoil, jarositic and pyritic materials). As the rainfall season progressed, infiltration in July decreased four to seven-fold from the initial values in April, resulting in an increase in runoff. Due to surface crusting, the traditional raised beds yielded the highest runoff (110 versus 50 – 60 mm in the other types in July). Aluminum concentrations in the bypass flow (6 – 22 mmol l- 1) associated with each of the three bed types were higher than in the runoff (3 – 14 mmol l- 1). In low and high raised beds, the amounts of aluminum transported by bypass flow (15 – 16 kmol ha- 1) was higher than in the runoff (4 – 6. 5 kmol ha- 1), while in the traditional type, the two components were similar (11 – 12 kmol ha- 1). The total amount of aluminum released from the low raised beds was lowest. Low raised beds thus pose less environmental hazards to the surroundings compared to the other two types. Interventions that affect the amount of aluminum transport in runoff and in bypass flow are important in balancing agricultural production and environmental protection in ASS area...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the mechanism of}} taurinuria in three inbred strains of mice: A/J, a normal taurine excretor (taut+); and two hypertaurinuric (taut-) strains, C 57 BL/ 6 J and PRO/Re. Plasma taurine is comparable in the three strains (approximately 0. 5 mM), but taurinuria is 10 -fold greater in taut- animals. Fractional reabsorption of taurine is 0. 967 +/- 0. 013 (mean +/- SD) in A/J); and 0. 839 +/- 0. 08 and 0. 787 +/- 0. 05 in C 57 BL/ 6 J and PRO/Re, respectively. Taurine concentration in renal cortex intracellular fluid (free of urine contamination) is similar in the three strains. Taurine reabsorption is inhibited by beta-alanine, in taut+ and taut- strains. These in vivo findings reveal residual taurine transport activity in the taut- phenotype and no evidence for impaired efflux at basilar membranes {{as the cause of}} impaired taurine reabsorption. Cortex slices provide information about uptake of amino acids at the antiluminal membrane. Taurine behaves as an inert metabolite in mouse kidney cortex slices. Taurine uptake by slices is active and, at less than 1 mM, is greater than normal in taut- slices. Concentration-dependent uptake studies reveal more than one taurine carrier in taut+ and taut- strains. The apparent Km values for uptake below 1 mM are different in taut- and taut+ slices (approximately 0. 2 mM and approximately 0. 7 mM, respectively); the apparent Km values above 1 mM taurine are similar in taut+ and taut- slices. Efflux from slices in all strains in the same (0. 0105 - 0. 0113 mumol-min- 1 -g- 1 wet wt), but taut- tissue retains about 10 % more radioactivity over the period of efflux. beta-Alanine is actively metabolized in mouse kidney. Its uptake in the presence of blocked transamination, is greater; its intracellular oxidation is attenuated; and its exchange with intracellular taurine is diminished in taut- slices. These findings indicate impaired beta-amino acid permeation on a low-Km uptake system at the luminal membrane in the taut- phenotype. beta-Amino <b>acids</b> are not <b>reclaimed</b> efficiently either from the innermost luminal pool in cortex slices or from the ultrafiltrate in the tubule lumen in vivo. The former leads to high uptake ratios in vitro, the latter to high clearance rates in vivo. In vitro and in vivo data are thus concordant. This {{is the first time that}} a hereditary defect in amino acid transport has been assigned to a specific membrane surface in mammalian kidney...|$|R
