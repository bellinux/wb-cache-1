40|$|Objective: Evidence {{shows that}} an {{elevated}} pulse pressure (PP) {{may lead to}} {{an increased risk of}} cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the effects of polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene on the PP after a first anterior acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Methods: Overall 116 patients with a first anterior AMI were included in this cross-sectional study. DNA was isolated from peripheral leukocytes. The ID status was determined by polymerase chain reaction by <b>a</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>staff</b> <b>member</b> who was unaware of the clinical details. Based on the polymorphism of the ACE gene, they were classified into 3 groups: Deletion/Deletion (DD) genotype (Group 1, n= 45), Insertion/Deletion (ID) genotype (Group 2, n= 58), Insertion/Insertion (II) genotype (Group 3, n= 13). Blood pressure measurements were performed in all patients within 10 minutes admitted to coronary care unit. The PP was calculated by subtraction of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from systolic blood pressure (SBP). Echocardiographic examinations were performed using the parasternal longitudinal axis and apical 4 -chamber windows in accordance with the recommendations of the American Echocardiography Committee. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Chi-square analyses were used to compare differences among subjects with different genotypes. Results: There were no significant differences among clinical parameters of patients. Pulse pressure was significantly higher in patients who have ACE DD and ID genotypes than in patients who have ACE II genotype (47 ± 16, 47 ± 14 and 39 ± 12, F= 3. 4, p< 0. 05). But SBP, DBP and heart rate were not significantly different among ACE DD, ACE ID and ACE II genotypes. Conclusion: Our results suggested that, ACE Gene I/D polymorphism D allele may affect PP in patients with a first anterior AMI...|$|E

40|$|Personal {{experiences}} of almost 17 {{years as an}} academic in engineering education in South Africa indicate that with the current teaching methods which are in use, course outcomes {{as required by the}} South African Qualification Authority (SAQA) are not achieved in learning Thermodynamics 2 (MTHE 2). The purpose of this research was to investigate alternative methods of teaching and learning MTHE 2 which would assist to improve the students’ academic performance. The population for this research was students registered for National Diploma Mechanical Engineering and the accessible population was 40 students registered for MTHE 2 from Walter Sisulu University, Chiselhurst campus. Out of these 40 students, 20 voluntarily agreed to be the sample. The theoretical framework for this study was social constructivism. Social constructivism states that learning is an active process and the process of knowledge construction occurs in a socio-cultural context where the student and environment actively interact. The student involves himself/herself and does neither remain nor be allowed to remain just as a passive observer. This was an action research where students were exposed to Guided Enquiry Based Learning (GEBL) in groups. From a social constructivists approach to learning, GEBL was used to engage students in social groups during the teaching-learning process with specific focus on selected academic discipline. All ethical considerations applicable to a study of the present nature were adhered to and in addition, signed informed consent forms were obtained from participants prior to the study. Students were given an introduction to the concepts and principles as per the pre-set syllabus for MTHE 2 and this was followed by problem solving sessions in which they were divided into four groups of five students each. The students were given a guided enquiry- and work-based example with an additional list of questions on each module of the syllabus. They had to select the most relevant questions from the list to analyse and develop a solution for each problem. The lecturers’ role was that of a facilitator who assisted each group with problems which the group encountered. This approach engaged students more actively in the learning process and placed more responsibility on them for their own progress in learning. This process also created an atmosphere for interaction with peers and assisted them to develop interpersonal and group communication skills. Key performance indicators were developed to measure {{the extent to which these}} outcomes were achieved. The researcher made use of an instrument structured in terms of Likert-type scale in order to objectively assess the extent of achievement. Data collected from the pilot study done in 2009 indicated that GEBL improved the students’ understanding of course content and problem analysis. Quantitative data were collected by means of standard assessment i. e. semester tests, an oral test, final examination and a KPI instrument. The KPIs were formulated to measure the extent to which the outcomes for MTHE 2 had been achieved. Qualitative data were collected through 30 -minute interviews, using an open-ended interview schedule, with each member of the sample. The interviews were done by a person who qualified both as an ‘insider and outsider’ in order to minimize the risk of bias and to maintain rigour in the research. In order to qualify as an ‘insider and outsider’, one ought to be as an insider: (a) from the same ethnic group, (b) qualified in Mechanical Engineering with Thermodynamics as a major course, (c) had no power disposition e. g. a former student or <b>a</b> <b>laboratory</b> assistant (excluding <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> within the mechanical engineering department) and as an outsider, one who was not part of the GEBL process. The quantitative scores from the assessments were analysed with Predictive Analysis Software (PASW) to determine the extent to which interventions had assisted student performance. The qualitative data from the interviews were analysed with N-Vivo to reveal the impact of GEBL on student learning and understanding of MTHE 2. The results indicated that with GEBL, the students’ overall scores improved from the first assessment score of 46 % written on half of the first module to the final assessment score of 55 % written on all seven modules. Students could handle larger volumes of work and still obtain a higher percentage. GEBL assisted students’ in recalling factual MTHE 2 concepts, understanding of MTHE 2 concepts, principles and applications. GEBL also enhanced students’ ability to communicate procedures and processes related to MTHE 2. KPIs formulated to measure the extent to which the outcomes were met in terms of student achievement indicated a 57 % achievement thereof. The KPIs developed gave a percentage achievement of the specified outcomes for MTHE 2 with GEBL. Theses KPIs can be used in future to measure the effectiveness of different teaching and learning methods in terms of achieving the outcomes. It is therefore recommended that GEBL be introduced into other engineering courses also to assist students in understanding course content and in achieving the course outcomes...|$|R

40|$|In {{the period}} from January to March 1981, Korean hemorrhagic fever (KHF) {{developed}} in 3 <b>laboratory</b> <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> of the Animal Experiment Center of Sapporo Medical College. The disease had an abrupt onset {{in all of the}} patients and was accompanied by high fever and chills and, at times, by malaise and anorexia. On admission, physical examinations demonstrated an injected pharynx, myalgia, abdominal tenderness and mild hepatomegaly. Within a few days after initiation of fever, the severest case revealed various signs, including shock, pulmonary congestion, renal failure, myositis and myocarditis. Laboratory examination showed marked proteinuria, leukocy-tosis, an increase in atypical lymphocytes, thrombocytopenia and an elevation of serum GOT, GPT, LDH, CPK, BUN and creatinine.

40|$|Abstract Background Reprocessing of {{endoscopes}} generally requires labour-intensive manual cleaning {{followed by}} high-level disinfection in an automated endoscope reprocessor (AER). EVOTECH Endoscope Cleaner and Reprocessor (ECR) is approved for fully automated {{cleaning and disinfection}} whereas AERs require manual cleaning prior to the high-level disinfection procedure. The purpose of this economic evaluation {{was to determine the}} cost-efficiency of the ECR versus AER methods of endoscopy reprocessing in an actual practice setting. Methods A time and motion study was conducted at a Canadian hospital to collect data on the personnel resources and consumable supplies costs {{associated with the use of}} EVOTECH ECR versus manual cleaning followed by AER with Medivators DSD- 201. Reprocessing of all endoscopes was observed and timed for both reprocessor types over three days. <b>Laboratory</b> <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> were interviewed regarding the consumption and cost of all disposable supplies and equipment. Exact Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for assessing differences in total cycle reprocessing time. Results Endoscope reprocessing was significantly shorter with the ECR than with manual cleaning followed by AER. The differences in median time were 12. 46 minutes per colonoscope (p Conclusions The EVOTECH ECR was more efficient and less costly to use for the reprocessing of endoscopes than manual cleaning followed by AER disinfection. Although the cost of consumable supplies required to reprocess endoscopes with EVOTECH ECR was slightly higher, the value of the labour time saved with EVOTECH ECR more than offset the additional consumables cost. The increased efficiency with EVOTECH ECR could lead to even further cost-savings by shifting endoscopy laboratory personnel responsibilities but further study is required. </p...|$|R

Approximately 700 patients’ samples per month required follow-up with the ordering provider to obtain ICD- 10 codes to support laboratory testing. The research design was conceptualized based on an interventional study and incorporated the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) model. Outreach client physician practices were selected for a telephone survey to assess the usefulness of an ICD- 10 code educational intervention. The educational intervention included the most commonly used ICD- 10 codes by internal medicine physicians, and a listing of ICD- 10 code websites with links which included CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services), CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and AHIMA (American Health Information Management Association).

Fifteen students, the nursing director, and two <b>laboratory</b> <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> were interviewed, using open-ended questions. A focus group was conducted among nine nursing faculty members. Interviews and the focus group were audiotaped, transcribed, and coded. Coded responses were classified into the following categories: (1) Characteristics of CBI that enhance learning. These included program characteristics such as interactivity; reinforcement of class content; application of theory, multisensory and realistic; curriculum characteristics, such as combination of required and optional assignments; accommodation of learning styles; and environmental factors, such as helpful staff. (2) Characteristics of CBI that hinder learning. These included program characteristics such as time pressures, no hands-on, and no rationales; curriculum characteristics such as too many assignments; and environmental characteristics including noise and overcrowding in the nursing laboratory. (3) Student behaviors. Those enhancing learning included working in groups, working alone, and reviewing for exams. Behaviors that hindered learning included rushing/skipping parts and cutting corners. (4) Student suggestions for improving CBI. These were curriculum related, such as using programs in class and fewer optional and required assignments, and environment related, such as improved access, increased privacy, and longer laboratory hours. The number of comments made by students and faculty for each code were counted and rank ordered. Bar charts presented structured reported findings in the order of significance. Further analysis of the coded responses {{led to the development of}} three major metapolicies: (1) CBI should be applied to appropriate content areas, (2) CBI should make reasonable demands on students, and (3) CBI should occur in an environment with minimal distractions.

Specimens of pus and urine account for 50 % of specimens received for non-tuberculosis investigations, and {{it would be impossible to}} process all specimens that might present a risk in B 1 accommodation and still maintain a high degree of safety. It is recommended that request forms which accompany specimens should clearly indicate potential high-risk specimens...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} continuously working blood culture systems in <b>a</b> discontinuous <b>laboratory</b> system. Methods: The systems used were BacT/Alert (Organon Teknika Corp., Durham, NC) and BACTEC NR 860 (Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Instruments, Sparks, Md) in a comparison in <b>a</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>staffed</b> 8 ½ h on Mondays to Fridays and 4 ½ h on Saturdays. Blood culture bottles (BacT/Alert aerobic and anaerobic, BACTEC NR 26 A and NR 27 A) were received thrice daily. Results: From 1824 pairs of blood culture vials, 110 clinically significant microorganisms were recovered by both BACTEC and BacT/Alert, 43 by BACTEC alone, and 33 by BacT/Alert alone. The differences between the systems in total recovery and in recovery of individual species were not statistically significant. The average detection times were 13. 36 h for BACTEC and 13. 93 h for BacT/Alert (P> 0. 1). These times represent only 35. 6 % (BACTEC) and 32. 6 % (BacT/Alert) of the total timespans from collection of blood to informing the ward of a positive result (tcrd, clinically relevant detection time). If 24 h per day blood culture processing conditions and continuous transport of vials to the laboratory had been available, these percentages would have risen to 87 % (BACTEC) and 87. 5 % (BacT/Alert). Under such ‘ideal’ conditions, ttrd could have been reduced by 22. 16 h using BACTEC and by 26. 81 h using BacT/Alert. The BacT/Alert system showed more false-positive results than the BACTEC system (80 (4. 39 %) versus 23 (1. 26 %), P< 0. 001). Conclusions: No time benefit for detection of positive blood cultures is gained with continuously measuring systems, if loading and processing of vials is organized discontinuously, as in our laboratory...|$|R
