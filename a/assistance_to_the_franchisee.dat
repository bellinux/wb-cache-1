40|$|From the literature, {{there are}} 13 factors {{discussed}} to be contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>franchisee</b> failure, {{which could be}} categorized into two categories, non-financial and financial factors. The non-financial factors consisted of nine factors and financial factors consisted of four factors. The non-financial factors include too rapid expansion of the franchise business, greed of franchisee, franchisee attitude, poor service, poor management of the franchise business, conflict with franchisor, legal imperfection, location and external factor. Meanwhile, financial factors looked at under capitalization of <b>the</b> <b>franchisee,</b> high overhead expenses, cash flow mismanagement and bad payers franchisee. For this individual assignment, this paper tried <b>to</b> determine whether <b>the</b> factors discussed in the literature could contributes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>franchisee</b> failures in Malaysia.

Although {{franchising}} {{is growing}} in importance {{as a form of}} business with considerable benefits to all participants, little research has been done <b>to</b> evaluate <b>the</b> factors that contribute to a successful franchise relationship from the viewpoint of <b>the</b> <b>franchisee.</b> This study is intended to provide valuable information for establishing an effective management strategy, with a view <b>to</b> improving <b>the</b> relationship between <b>the</b> franchisor and <b>franchisee.</b> <b>The</b> study will include an analysis of the predictors of a quality relationship between the franchisor and the franchisee; and attempts <b>to</b> increase <b>the</b> understanding of the relationships between the predictors of a quality relationship, which may contribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>franchisee's</b> performance and satisfaction. Using the survey responses of <b>the</b> <b>franchisees</b> of <b>the</b> Convenience stores within the Petroleum Industry, this study identifies key factors that affect <b>the</b> <b>franchisee's</b> motivation <b>to</b> become a <b>franchisee,</b> <b>the</b> <b>franchisee's</b> perception of <b>the</b> franchisor's support, the quality of <b>the</b> relationship, loyalty/commitment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> franchisor and <b>the</b> <b>franchisee's</b> performance. <b>The</b> results of this study provide strong support for the idea that the quality {{of the relationship between the}} franchisor and <b>the</b> <b>franchisee</b> plays a key role in ensuring that the contractual relationship will lead to financial success for both parties.
