40|$|The {{variability}} of milk <b>and</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> prices {{has been a}} topic of “enduring quality ” since the late 1980 s, when milk <b>and</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> prices became much more volatile {{than in the previous}} two decades. One oft-cited cause of this increase in volatility was a reduction purchase prices for <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> following the large expenditures on the Dairy Price Support Program in the early 1980 s. With the reduction in government support, the {{variability of}} farm milk <b>and</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> prices increased dramatically (Figure 1). An obvious basic issue with price variation is that someone must assume the risks associated with price changes. Thus, increases in the variability of milk prices have led to additional challenges for farm business planning, debt repayment, and in some cases, solvency of farm businesses. Price volatility may have increased the rate of structura...|$|R

5|$|Salt {{is present}} in most foods, but in {{naturally}} occurring foodstuffs such as meats, vegetables and fruit, it {{is present in}} very small quantities.

Thus, herring contains 67mg sodium per 100g, while kipper, its preserved form, contains 990mg. Similarly, pork typically contains 63mg while bacon contains 1,480mg, and potatoes contain 7mg but potato crisps 800mg per 100 g.

5|$|Selfe {{achieved}} {{international recognition}} in 1861 when leading British journal The Engineer published illustrations of his designs {{for one of}} the first refrigerating machines. One such machine was installed behind the Royal Hotel in George Street in Sydney's ice-works– one of the world's earliest commercial refrigeration plants. The decades following Selfe's arrival in Australia were watershed years in the development of refrigeration technology, and he was closely involved with its evolution. The introduction of refrigeration to the colony revolutionised farming, allowing the expansion of settlement, and made possible the export of meat <b>and</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> In Sydney itself, refrigeration changed commercial practices and led to the eventual demise of city dairies. Selfe became an international authority on refrigeration engineering; he wrote articles and eventually a definitive textbook on the subject, published in the US in 1900.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{extractive}} {{industries have}} contributed strongly to New Zealand's economy, focussing {{at different times}} on sealing, whaling, flax, gold, kauri gum, and native timber. With the development of refrigerated shipping in the 1880s meat <b>and</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> were exported to Britain, a trade which {{provided the basis for}} strong economic growth in New Zealand. High demand for agricultural products from the United Kingdom and the United States helped New Zealanders achieve higher living standards than both Australia and Western Europe in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1973, New Zealand's export market was reduced when the United Kingdom joined the European Community and other compounding factors, such as the 1973 oil and 1979 energy crisis, led to a severe economic depression. Living standards in New Zealand fell behind those of Australia and Western Europe, and by 1982 New Zealand had the lowest per-capita income of all the developed nations surveyed by the World Bank. In the mid-1980s New Zealand deregulated its agricultural sector by phasing out subsidies over a three-year period. Since 1984, successive governments engaged in major macroeconomic restructuring (known first as Rogernomics and then Ruthanasia), rapidly transforming New Zealand from a protected and highly regulated economy to a liberalised free trade economy.|$|E
