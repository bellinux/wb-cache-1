Many-one reductions are valuable because most well-studied complexity classes are closed under some type of many-one reducibility, including P, NP, L, NL, co-NP, PSPACE, EXP, and many others. These classes are not closed under arbitrary many-one reductions, however.|$|R

The moderating structure was obtained by using an inner sphere of Pb embedded in a high-density polyethylene (HDPe) brick assembly. The number of capture events in <b>a</b> <b>Cd</b> sample placed <b>outside</b> the structure was used, by varying the dimensions of the brick assembly, to determine the best moderator geometry. Furthermore, the detection of land mines by neutron capture reaction on nitrogen nuclei contained in the explosive was simulated by in field measurements placing the Cd sample at different depths in the soil.

40|$|AbstractCytochrome c oxidase is {{essential}} for aerobic life as a membrane-bound energy transducer. O 2 reduction at the haem a 3 –CuB centre consumes electrons transferred via haem <b>a</b> from cytochrome <b>c</b> <b>outside</b> the membrane. Protons are taken up from the inside, both to form water and to be pumped across the membrane (M. K. F. Wikström, Nature 266 (1977) 271 [1]; M. Wikström, K. Krab, M. Saraste, Cytochrome Oxidase, A Synthesis, Academic Press, London, 1981 [2]). The resulting electrochemical proton gradient drives ATP synthesis (P. Mitchell, Chemiosmotic Coupling in Oxidative and Photosynthetic Phosphorylation, Glynn Research, Bodmin, UK, 1966 [3]). Here we present a molecular mechanism for proton pumping coupled to oxygen reduction {{that is based on}} the unique properties of water in hydrophobic cavities. An array of water molecules conducts protons from a conserved glutamic acid, either to the Δ-propionate of haem a 3 (pumping), or to haem a 3 –CuB (water formation). Switching between these pathways is controlled by the redox-state-dependent electric field between haem a and haem a 3 –CuB, which determines the water–dipole orientation, and therefore the proton transfer direction. Proton transfer via the propionate provides a gate to O 2 reduction. This pumping mechanism explains the unique arrangement of the metal cofactors in the structure. It is consistent with the large body of biochemical data, and is shown to be plausible by molecular dynamics simulations...|$|R

40|$|Microphthalmia is {{a severe}} ocular disorder, and this {{condition}} is typically caused by mutations in transcription {{factors that are}} involved in eye development. Mice carrying mutations in these transcription factors would be useful tools for defining the mechanisms underlying developmental eye disorders. We discovered a new spontaneous recessive microphthalmos mouse mutant in the Japanese wild-derived inbred strain KOR 1 /Stm. The homozygous mutant mice were histologically characterized as microphthalmic by the absence of crystallin in the lens, a condition referred to as aphakia. By positional cloning, we identified the nonsense mutation <b>c.</b> 444 <b>C.</b> <b>A</b> <b>outside</b> the genomic region that encodes the homeodomain of the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 3 gene (Pitx 3) as the mutation responsible for the microphthalmia and aphakia. We examined Pitx 3 mRNA expression of mutant mice during embryonic stages using RT-PCR and found that the expression levels are higher than in wild-type mice. Pitx 3 over-expression in the lens during developmental stages was also confirmed at the protein level in the microphthalmos mutants via immunohistochemical analyses. Although lens fiber differentiation was not observed in the mutants, strong PITX 3 protein signals were observed in the lens vesicles of the mutant lens. Thus, we speculated that abnormal PITX 3, which lacks the C-terminus (including the OAR domain) as a result o...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Rehydration in the triatomine bug Rhodnius prolixus (Stål) is {{dependent}} on the blood meal, and water balance regulation is crucial for survival of starving bugs. In an experimental arena with zones at different climatic conditions, starved R. prolixus nymphs prefer a cooler and more humid zone, stopping there more often and for longer periods. This is probably a behavioural adaptation to limit water loss and reduce metabolic rate. In the Venezuelan State of Portuguesa, temperature and humidity were monitored in three kinds of potential refugia during the dry season: (i) in a palm roof; (ii) in a crack of the wall of a house; and (iii) in a palm tree crown. Fluctuations in temperature and saturation deficit are not very different inside and outside the palm roof except during a few hours of the day when the sun is at its zenith. In the crack of the wall, the diurnal temperature range is reduced to 6. 5 C compared with 12. 4 <b>C</b> <b>outside,</b> and the saturation deficit varies by only 7. 6 hPa compared with 28. 6 hPa outside.
