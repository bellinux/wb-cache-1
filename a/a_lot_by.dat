They can learn <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>by</b> asking questions directly to international students from various countries. Some local schools may request specific topics for volunteers to present about their country, especially if the students are learning it in class. If not, a simple PowerPoint with basic background information including geography, language, food, music, dance, sports, holidays, weather, and celebrations is sufficient. The content and depth of presentations depends on whether volunteers will be presenting to elementary, middle school or high school students or adults. Usually presentations will also include an activity for children to get involved such as learning a dance, song, game or several words and phrases in the language.|$|E

25|$|Internet {{connectivity}} also varies <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>by</b> State. In 2011, the US Census Bureau {{conducted a}} survey to determine internet access in each State.

Mississippi reported the lowest rate of access, with 41.0% of people reporting no internet access at home or elsewhere. As a general trend {{it is easy to see}} that Appalachian and Southern States in general have a much lower rate of Internet usage when compared to other regions. This correlates greatly with the average income of those states. Lower income states reporting lower rates of usage, and higher income states reporting higher rates of connectivity. Also it may be a matter of population density. There are a lot more disconnected individuals in states with many counties of low population density. This could be because Internet Service Providers are less likely to make a profit in these areas.|$|E

For the following scene, the production crew set a man on fire, while using a fire suit. This stunt is known as [...] a [...] "full burn." [...] Scenes like this are [...] "very dangerous" [...] as one can't breathe. In total, he was on fire between 25–30 seconds, which is seen as <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>by</b> filming standards.

[...] Reviewing for Melody Maker, Ray Coleman highlighted Harrison's vocal and the musical contributions from Horn and Russell, and said: [...] "It's a dead cert disco smash, his finest single since 'My Sweet Lord'." [...] Coleman added that the lyrics were [...] "deceptively simple" [...] since, as with Harrison's 1969 composition [...] "Something", [...] "they say <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>by</b> saying a little." [...] Writing later in the 1970s, however, in their book , Roy Carr and Tony Tyler dismissed the song with the words: [...] "Doleful, lacklustre, [...] would-be singalongs which quite fail to arouse." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{is true that}} Islam is still, in many ways, a man's religion. But I think I’ve found {{evidence}} {{in some of the}} early sources that seems to show that Muhammad made things better for women. It appears that in some parts of Arabia, notably in Mecca, a matrilineal system {{was in the process of}} being replaced by a patrilineal one at the time of Muhammad. Growing prosperity caused by a shifting of trade routes was accompanied by a growth in individualism. Men were amassing considerable personal wealth and wanted to be sure that this would be inherited by their own actual sons, and not simply by an extended family of their sisters’ sons. This led to a deterioration in the rights of women. At the time Islam began, the conditions of women were terrible - they had no right to own property, were supposed to be the property of the man, and if the man died everything went to his sons. Muhammad improved things quite <b>a</b> <b>lot.</b> <b>By</b> instituting rights of property ownership, inheritance, education and divorce, he gave women certain basic safeguards. Set in such historical context the Prophet can be seen as a figure who testified on behalf of women's rights.|$|E
