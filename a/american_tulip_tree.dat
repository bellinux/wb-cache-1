2500|$|Liriodendron tulipifera—known as the tulip tree, <b>American</b> <b>tulip</b> <b>tree,</b> tuliptree, tulip poplar, whitewood, fiddletree, and yellow-poplar—is the Western Hemisphere {{representative}} of the two-species genus Liriodendron, and the tallest eastern hardwood. It is native to eastern North America from Southern Ontario and Illinois eastward to southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and south to central Florida and Louisiana. It can grow to more than [...] in virgin cove forests of the Appalachian Mountains, often with no limbs until it reaches [...] in height, making it a very valuable timber tree. It is fast-growing, without the common problems of weak wood strength and short lifespan often seen in fast-growing species. April marks {{the start of the}} flowering period in the southern USA (except as noted below); trees at the northern limit of cultivation begin to flower in June. The flowers are pale green or yellow (rarely white), with an orange band on the tepals; they yield large quantities of nectar. The tulip tree is the state tree of Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the garden}} {{emphasis}} is placed on its educational potential; its collection is extensive and well-labelled and there are many posters describing points of botanical/ecological interest, designed to stimulate further interest in trees, especially amongst younger visitors. The collection includes numerous species and cultivars from Northern Asia, North America and other temperate regions around the world; it includes cultivars of Cornus kousa (Chinese dogwood), Liquidambar styraciflua (<b>American</b> sweetgum), Liriodendron (<b>tulip</b> <b>tree)</b> and various Betula (birch) species, as well as other woody plants from many different genera.The arboretum includes a 2007 planting of 75 Sequoiadendron giganteum, the well-known giant redwood from the mountains of Southern California, and this area of the arboretum is intended to become a redwood grove in the future. Britain's first [...] "Singing Sequoia" [...] was commissioned in BlueBell Arboretum in spring, 2013; this automated musical and educational feature is amongst a group planting of Coastal Redwoods, which fully-grown in California are the tallest trees in the world. The aim of this planting is to create a small-scale representation of a Californian redwood forest, complete with sword ferns, 'Polystichum munitum', growing beneath the redwoods and skunk cabbages, 'Lysichiton americanus', in a nearby damp area.|$|R

50|$|Morchella ulmaria is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Morchellaceae. It was {{described}} as new to science in 2012 by Philippe Clowez.

The species occurs in the forests of Midwestern North America, often associated with white ash (Fraxinus americana), the <b>American</b> <b>tulip</b> <b>tree</b> (Liriodendron tulipifera) or species of maple or elm.

It is a street tree at the University of Victoria and along the Veterans' Memorial Parkway in Langford, British Columbia. In cultivation it grows as fast as the <b>American</b> <b>tulip</b> <b>tree.</b> A cultivar (J.C.Raulston) with leaves larger and darker than typical has been developed in North Carolina.|$|E

50|$|Vilmorin {{was founded}} as a plant and seed {{boutique}} in 1743 by seed expert Claude Geoffroy {{and her husband}} Pierre Andrieux, the chief seed supplier and botanist to King Louis XV. The store was located on the quai de la Mégisserie, a street in the 1st arrondissement of Paris. In 1774, their daughter married botany enthusiast Philippe-Victoire Levêque de Vilmorin (1746-1804). Together, they revived the stores and created the Vilmorin-Andrieux House, which later became Vilmorin-Andrieux and Company {{under the leadership of}} their son, Philippe André de Vilmorin (1776-1862). Philippe-Victoire de Vilmorin began importing trees and exotic plants into Europe in 1766, starting with the <b>American</b> <b>tulip</b> <b>tree,</b> the domesticated beet, and the rutabaga. Such plants were unknown in Europe prior to Vilmorin-Andrieux's commercial promotion of them for food, fodder and ornamentation.|$|E

It is native to eastern North America from Southern Ontario and Illinois eastward to southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and south to central Florida and Louisiana. It can grow to more than 50 m in virgin cove forests of the Appalachian Mountains, often with no limbs until it reaches 25 - 30 m in height, making it a very valuable timber tree. It is fast-growing, without the common problems of weak wood strength and short lifespan often seen in fast-growing species.

5000|$|In 1810 the Twin Springs Hotel (later {{known as}} the Mineral Spring Hotel, part of the Crowninshield estate and the Fay Estate Mansion of Lynn) was built near the spring, whose water was rich in iron and {{believed}} to possess medicinal qualities. Patients traveled great distances to drink the water and, for a time, to worship the goddess Hygeia to restore their health. This [...] "classical worship" [...] damaged the hotel's reputation, and it was later converted into the private summer residence of Richard Sullivan Fay. From 1847-1865 Fay (an Anglo-American farmer, merchant and manufacturer) lived on a 500 acre estate on the hillsides surrounding Spring Pond partly in Lynn (the present Fay Estate), partly in present-day Salem (the present Camp Lion and WalMart, extending to Danvers Road), growing in his arboretum (which was open to the public) a variety of rare and exotic trees and shrubs imported {{from other parts of}} the world; many arrived here first in the United States, among them the <b>American</b> <b>tulip</b> <b>tree.</b> Some descendants of Fay's trees and shrubs continue to grow near Spring Pond, although most of the rare trees were cut by a lumber company in 1910. In 1862, Fay commissioned an army at his own expense. Officers and members of the 38th Regiment of Massachusetts named the company the “Fay Light Guard”. It was attached to the 39th Massachusetts Regiment and fought at Port Hudson, Cane River, Mansion Plains, Winchester, Fisher’s Hill and Cedar Creek.|$|E
