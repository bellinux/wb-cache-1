5|$|Although {{earmarked}} for operations against the Soviet Union, Luftflotte 2 {{remained in the}} west until May 1941. This was partly as a deception measure, <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> new airbases in Poland could not be completed by 1 June 1941 target date, although they were made ready {{in time for the}} actual commencement of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941. Kesselring established his new headquarters at Bielany, a suburb of Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{development}} of the linen industry, Ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution, partly because it lacked coal and iron resources <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> {{of the impact of the}} sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England, which saw Ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital.|$|E
5|$|Even so, <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of Sickles's {{unexpected}} location, Longstreet's assault did {{not proceed}} according to Lee's plan. Instead of wheeling left {{to join a}} simultaneous two-division push {{on either side of}} the Emmitsburg Road, Hood's division attacked in a more easterly direction than intended, and McLaws's and Anderson's divisions deployed brigade by brigade, in an en echelon style of attack, also heading more to the east than the intended northeast.|$|E
50|$|The {{study is}} unique <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> {{of the long}} time span of the cohort, <b>and</b> also <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of the high social status {{of some of the}} study participants.|$|R
5000|$|... "The first <b>and</b> best, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> Van Dine had {{the real-life}} {{model of the}} Joseph Elwell murder (1920) to hold his fancy in check." ...|$|R
50|$|The Industrial Revolution in Germany {{occurred}} {{a century}} later than in England, France, <b>and</b> Belgium, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> Germany only became a unified country in 1871.|$|R
5|$|Leith {{spent seven}} months of {{recording}} and writing and worked with Bryon Jones, James Roche and Ross Fraser. Initially, he wanted the album {{to be released in}} March, but it was pushed back to August, partly due to the prolonged success of The Winner's Journey <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of the large amount of songs they had to cull.|$|E
5|$|After graduating, Synge {{decided that}} he wanted to be a {{professional}} musician and went to Germany to study music. He stayed in Coblenz during 1893 and moved to Würzburg in January 1894. Partly because he was shy about performing in public, <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of doubt about his ability, he decided to abandon music and pursue his literary interests. He returned to Ireland in June 1894, and moved to Paris in January 1895 to study literature and languages at the Sorbonne.|$|E
5|$|Partly {{because of}} {{theoretical}} and mathematical difficulties <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of the extremely high energies (beyond what is technologically {{possible for the}} foreseeable future) needed to test these theories experimentally, there is so far no experimental evidence that would unambiguously point {{to any of these}} models being a correct fundamental description of nature. This has led some in the community to criticize these approaches to unification and question the value of continued research on these problems.|$|E
60|$|I put in {{a little}} Greek now <b>and</b> then, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> it sounds so much like the ocean,--though I doubt if Homer's Mediterranean Sea ever sounded so loud as this.|$|R
50|$|The {{practice}} of feeding the pigs to become so heavy has been criticised as inhumane <b>and</b> cruel, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> the great weights limit the pig's movements and strains their internal organs.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow awarded the album four stars and said [...] "all {{of the songs}} sound quite fresh, {{partly due to the}} unusual {{instrumentation}} <b>and</b> also <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of the players' inventiveness".|$|R
5|$|Sources differ {{about the}} cities hosting {{some of the}} early IMOs. This may be partly because leaders are {{generally}} housed well away from the students, <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> after the competition the students did not always stay based in one city {{for the rest of the}} IMO. The exact dates cited may also differ, because of leaders arriving before the students, and at more recent IMOs the IMO Advisory Board arriving before the leaders.|$|E
5|$|The leading Western economies adopted Keynes's policy {{recommendations}} before {{the outbreak of}} World War II, and in the two decades following Keynes's death in 1946, almost all capitalist governments had done so. Keynes's influence waned in the 1970s, {{partly as a result}} of the stagflation that plagued the Anglo-American economies during that decade, <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of criticism of Keynesian policies by Milton Friedman and other monetarists. He and other economists had disputed the ability of government to regulate the business cycle favourably with fiscal policy.|$|E
5|$|Although the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System began pumping oil in 1977, it did {{not have}} a major {{immediate}} impact on global oil prices. This is partly because it took several years to reach full production <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> U.S. production outside Alaska declined until the mid-1980s. The Iranian Revolution and OPEC price increases triggered the 1979 energy crisis despite TAPS production increases. Oil prices remained high until the late 1980s, when a stable international situation, the removal of price controls, and the peak of production at Prudhoe Bay contributed to the 1980s oil glut. In 1988, TAPS was delivering 25 percent of all U.S. oil production. As North Slope oil production declined, so did TAPS' share of U.S. production. Today, TAPS provides less than 17 percent of U.S. oil production.|$|E
25|$|Already Gustav I of Sweden {{appointed}} exceptionally many Finnish nobles as High Councillors of the Realm, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> {{of trust}} <b>and</b> loyalty, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> almost all adult male Swedish high nobles had been efficiently axed {{just a few}} of years earlier by Christian II and thus were not available for appointments.|$|R
6000|$|... "Partly," [...] Wolfenden answered, [...] "for {{the reason}} which I have already given you--because your niece is of age; <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> also <b>because</b> you persist in giving me no {{definite}} reason for your refusal." ...|$|R
5000|$|Fraser Canyon - a.k.a. [...] "The Canyon". This term {{is often}} used to include the canyon of the Thompson River between Ashcroft <b>and</b> Lytton, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> the highway route is usually {{referred}} to as both the Canyon and the Fraser Canyon.|$|R
5|$|As {{with other}} media, {{newspapers}} were {{controlled by the}} state, with the Reich Press Chamber shutting down or buying newspapers and publishing houses. By 1939, over {{two thirds of the}} newspapers and magazines were directly owned by the Propaganda Ministry. The NSDAP daily newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter ("Ethnic Observer"), was edited by Alfred Rosenberg, author of The Myth of the Twentieth Century, a book of racial theories espousing Nordic superiority. Goebbels controlled the wire services and insisted that all newspapers in Germany only publish content favourable to the regime. His propaganda ministry issued two dozen directives every week on exactly what news should be published and what angles to use; the typical newspaper followed the directives closely. Newspaper readership plummeted, partly because of the decreased quality of the content <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of the surge in popularity of radio.|$|E
5|$|Between 1945 and 1950 the US {{fleet of}} battleships had been entirely decommissioned; however, Missouri was spared this fate {{due to the}} {{influence}} of President Harry S. Truman, a native Missourian, who refused to allow the battleship to be decommissioned, and against the advice of Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson, Secretary of the Navy John L. Sullivan, and Chief of Naval Operations Louis E. Denfeld, Truman ordered Missouri to be maintained with the active fleet partly because of his fondness for the battleship <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> the battleship had been christened by his daughter. As a result, Missouri was involved in various training and flag waving exercises at home and abroad between World War II and the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|Common {{blackbirds}} {{spend much}} of their time looking for food on the ground where they can become infested with ticks, which are external parasites that most commonly attach to the head of a blackbird. In France, 74% of rural blackbirds were found to be infested with Ixodes ticks, whereas, only 2% of blackbirds living in urban habitats were infested. This is partly because it is more difficult for ticks to find another host on lawns and gardens in urban areas than in uncultivated rural areas, <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> ticks are likely to be commoner in rural areas, where a variety of tick hosts, such as foxes, deer and boar, are more numerous. Although ixodid ticks can transmit pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and are known to transmit Borrelia bacteria to birds, {{there is no evidence that}} this affects the fitness of blackbirds except when they are exhausted and run down after migration.|$|E
2500|$|Castle Chamber {{was set up}} {{partly to}} curb the [...] number of {{petitions}} to the English Council on [...] Irish affairs, <b>and</b> [...] <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> the Irish Council, unlike its English counterpart, [...] had not until then had [...] a separate judicial identity.|$|R
50|$|Kästner {{began to}} publish less <b>and</b> less, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of his {{increasing}} alcoholism. He {{did not join}} any of the post-war literary movements in West Germany, and in the 1950s and 1960s he came to be perceived mainly as an author of children's books.|$|R
5000|$|We {{supported}} Reza Shah, and {{we wanted}} to support his effort to create a modern nation state, to lift us from our backwardness. At this time we talked about Pan-Iraniasm, or reuniting Afghanistan with Iran. We also talked of nationalism. Ferdowsi became very popular <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of Reza Shah's support for him, <b>and</b> also <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of the nationalistic impulses the shahnameh inspired ...|$|R
5|$|Focused on hockey, {{exposed to}} drugs and alcohol and {{frequently}} getting into fights, James {{paid little attention to}} her education and nearly dropped out of school. A vice-principal at Valley Park Middle School, Ross Dixon, encouraged her to pay greater attention to her studies, allowing her to graduate from Overlea High School, now named Marc Garneau Collegiate Institute, and move onto Seneca College in Toronto. James struggled academically in her first year at Seneca, partially because she had rarely been held accountable for failing in her studies in the past, <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> she was playing two sports at both the college and community level while working part-time jobs to help pay the family's bills. Seneca's hockey coach Lee Trempe had several arguments with James before she began to take her studies seriously.|$|E
5|$|Helena saw {{relatively}} little of her surviving siblings, and continued {{her role as}} a support to the monarchy and a campaigner for the many charities she represented. She and Christian led a quiet life, but did carry out a few royal engagements. On one such occasion, the elderly couple represented the King at the silver wedding anniversary, in 1906, of Kaiser Wilhelm II (Helena's nephew) and his wife Augusta Victoria (Christian's niece). During the Edwardian period, Helena visited the grave of her son, Prince Christian Victor, who died in 1900 following a bout with malaria while serving in the Second Boer War. She was met by South African Prime Minister Louis Botha, but Jan Smuts refused to meet her, partly because he was bitter that South Africa had lost the war <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> his son had died in a British concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|In 1706, the Elector of Bavaria was {{deprived}} of his offices and titles for siding with Louis against the Empire. The following year, George was invested as an Imperial Field Marshal with {{command of the}} imperial army stationed along the Rhine. His tenure was not altogether successful, partly because he was deceived by his ally, the Duke of Marlborough, into a diversionary attack, <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> Emperor Joseph I appropriated the funds necessary for George's campaign for his own use. Despite this, the German princes {{thought that he had}} acquitted himself well. In 1708 they formally confirmed George's position as a Prince-Elector in recognition of, or because of, his service. George did not hold Marlborough's actions against him which he understood were part of a plan to lure French forces from the main attack.|$|E
50|$|Dickson McCunn: an {{affluent}} retired grocer, whose unostentatious and dour but stubborn and determined nature {{makes him a}} surprising hero. Dickson McCunn is formidable <b>and</b> dangerous <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> he seems unremarkable and ordinary, and friends and enemies alike are taken by surprise when he acts boldly.|$|R
50|$|False {{charges of}} heresy and sodomy set aside, the {{guilt or innocence}} of the Templars {{is one of the}} more {{difficult}} historical problems, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of the atmosphere of hysteria that had built up in the preceding generation (marked by habitually intemperate language and extravagant denunciations exchanged between temporal rulers <b>and</b> churchmen), <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> the subject has been embraced by conspiracy theorists and quasi-historians.|$|R
2500|$|He worried, {{along with}} William Hague, about the {{possibility}} of English nationalism: [...] "As we move into this new century, people's sense of Englishness will become more articulated <b>and</b> that's <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of the mirror that devolution provides us with and because we're becoming more European at the same time." ...|$|R
5|$|In 1982, the Talbot Group was {{merged into}} Peugeot within PSA, and {{responsibility}} for the model was devolved to France. The Whitley design studio was dissolved, {{and some of the}} designers crossed over to British Leyland, where they joined their former boss Roy Axe. PSA had by then already started work on a replacement for the Samba, based on the Citroën AX, a few prototypes of which—essentially rebadged AXs—were created in 1983/84. The Samba sold reasonably well throughout 1982 and 1983, after which sales began to suffer, partly because of the model's aging <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of competition from the very popular Peugeot 205, which created powerful (and successful) internal competition within PSA for the little Talbot.|$|E
5|$|Keith interrogates Aaron {{and threatens}} him. Veronica and Clarence go into Amelia's boyfriend's room and Clarence dangles him off a window ledge, {{but he knows}} nothing. Weevil and Logan get into a fight at school, partly because of Logan's bail <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> Logan has just bought Weevil's grandmother's house and kicked her out. Veronica is {{contacted}} by Amelia's friend, who says that the killer is actually a man named Carlos. Clarence decides to track down Carlos, {{despite the fact that}} he is a diplomat's son. Veronica lies to Abel Koontz about Amelia's fate to spare his feelings before his death. Keith goes inside the police station evidence room to examine the remains of the bus that mysteriously went off a cliff and finds the remains of a rat.|$|E
5|$|Partly from Cowper's {{literary}} influence, <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> learned vicars {{were expected}} to write verses, Newton began to try his hand at hymns, which had become popular through the language, made plain for common people to understand. Several prolific hymn writers were at their most productive in the 18th century, including Isaac Watts whose hymns Newton had grown up hearing and Charles Wesley, with whom Newton was familiar. Wesley's brother John, the eventual founder of the Methodist Church, had encouraged Newton {{to go into the}} clergy. Watts was a pioneer in English hymn writing, basing his work after the Psalms. The most prevalent hymns by Watts and others were written in the common meter in 8.6.8.6: the first line is eight syllables and the second is six.|$|E
60|$|A {{meditation}} on the obvious inference was indulged in by all, and during its continuance each directed his vision into the ashpit, which glowed like a desert in the tropics under a vertical sun, shaping their eyes long <b>and</b> liny, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of the light, partly from {{the depth of the}} subject discussed.|$|R
5000|$|I {{have always}} been fascinated by red stars, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> they were easy to find in a {{telescope}} field, <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> also <b>because</b> they seemed to warm things up a bit on a cold winter night. Thus I early became acquainted with the celebrate carbon star 280 Schjellerup, better known as WZ Cassiopeiae, which was recognized about 100 years ago as an unusual member {{of a group of}} red stars then known as the stars of Secchi's fourth type.|$|R
5000|$|Author Kate Mosse {{is quoted}} as saying [...] "... it reads like a novel <b>and</b> it's <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> Simon is a really great writer... The thing that distinguishes Simon's book from the other guides that there have been in this area is he has {{squarely}} said it cannot be a classic if it's not entertaining" ...|$|R
