5|$|In 1863 Coffin became and {{agent for}} the Western Freedman's <b>Aid</b> <b>Society,</b> which offered {{assistance}} to the slaves who were freed during the war. As Union troops moved into the South, Coffin's group coordinated aid to slaves who had escaped to Union territory and began collecting food and other goods to distribute to former slaves who were now behind the Union lines. Coffin also petitioned the U.S. government to create the Freedmen's Bureau to assist the freed slaves. After the war he became involved in helping freed slaves establish businesses and obtain an education. In 1864, {{as a leader of}} the Freedman's <b>Aid</b> <b>Society,</b> he sought aid in Great Britain, where his advocacy {{led to the formation of}} the Englishman's Freedmen's <b>Aid</b> <b>Society.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the war Coffin {{raised more}} than $100,000 in one year for the Western Freedman's <b>Aid</b> <b>Society</b> to provide food, clothing, money, and other aid to the newly freed slave {{population}} in the United States.

Between 1882 and 1883 City Road was built over the front lawn of the Hospital.|$|E

40|$|According to a draft bill {{currently}} {{before the}} Italian Parliament, mutual <b>aid</b> <b>societies</b> {{should be considered}} as part of the Third Sector. And yet, when considering the primary aim of mutual <b>aid</b> <b>societies</b> (i. e. benefiting their members, rather than society at large), this position cannot be taken for granted. The paper discusses the opportunity to include mutual <b>aid</b> <b>societies</b> into a more broadly defined Third Sector, by investigating the activities that these organizations are actually carrying out, with particular reference to the organizations working in health and social care services. The authors compare the nature and purposes of mutual <b>aid</b> <b>societies</b> and with those of other Third Sector organizations, and discuss the potential benefit of including this particular category for advancing the Italian welfare system. Including mutual <b>aid</b> <b>societies</b> into the Third Sector could enhance the social role of these institutions and increase the contribution that private organizations pursuing collective aims can give to {{the construction of a new}} – and more pluralistic – welfare system...|$|R
50|$|Children’s <b>Aid</b> <b>Societies</b> {{also provide}} assessments, crisis intervention, {{counseling}} {{and services to}} prevent child abuse and neglect. In addition, Children’s <b>Aid</b> <b>Societies</b> help vulnerable families protect and support their children. Many prevention programs are offered in partnership with other community agencies. Child protection workers also work to support families in crisis where their children are not in need of protection. A child protection worker remains involved with the family to ensure the appropriate supports and community services are in place. In 2007/08, 24,955 families received ongoing support from Children’s <b>Aid</b> <b>Societies</b> where a child {{was in need of}} protection.|$|R

5|$|Some {{factions in}} the ACLU {{proposed}} {{new directions for}} the organization. In the late 1930s, some local affiliates proposed shifting their emphasis from civil liberties appellate actions, to becoming a legal <b>aid</b> <b>society,</b> centered on store front offices in low income neighborhoods. The ACLU directors rejected that proposal. Other ACLU members wanted the ACLU to shift focus into the political arena, and to {{be more willing to}} compromise their ideals in order to strike deals with politicians. This initiative was also rejected by the ACLU leadership.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{music in}} North Georgia, including {{what is now}} Athens, {{was that of the}} Native Americans of the area, principally the Creek and the Cherokee. Athens was officially chartered in 1806, and began growing rapidly near the middle of the 19th century. By the time of the American Civil War in the 1860s, the city was an important part of musical life in Georgia. The war accelerated the development of the city's musical importance, as Athens was largely spared widespread destruction while the larger city of Atlanta {{took a long time to}} recover. Major touring acts like the Dixie Family and The Slomans visited Athens during the war; the Dixie Family, a prominent touring group, performed disastrously, according to local newspapers, who said that the highlight of the performance came from four local African American musicians, and the Dixie Family had absconded with the concert's proceeds, which had been promised to the local Ladies <b>Aid</b> <b>Society.</b> In the 1870s, the city was almost half African American, and local black-owned industry flourished; among the residents was Bob Cole, born in 1868 to a musically active family. Cole would later become a pioneer in African American theater, known for works like the 1898 musical A Trip to Coontown.|$|E

40|$|While {{other professions}} have {{attempted}} to make their services more readily available in recent years, the legal profession 2 ̆ 7 s availability has remained relatively static. Today there is a considerable lack of legal services for a {{great majority of the}} people. This lack of available services is most critical in the lower and middle income classes. Only recently have any remedies to this problem been suggested and actively undertaken. Legal <b>aid</b> <b>societies,</b> lawyer referral services, and group legal service plans are the three primary methods used to combat the problem. Legal <b>aid</b> <b>societies</b> are primarily for lower income individuals while group legal service plans and lawyer referral services are mainly for use by the middle class. However, at this time only the legal <b>aid</b> <b>societies</b> and the lawyer referral plans have become workable tools. Group legal service programs are not yet sufficiently established to provide adequate relief. It is {{the purpose of this article}} to consider the effect of these programs on the lower and middle income classes. Since legal <b>aid</b> <b>societies</b> and lawyer referral plans are becoming well established, the first portion of this paper is devoted to a brief history of legal <b>aid</b> <b>societies</b> and lawyer referral plans and the development of the present need for group legal service plans. It is shown that even though both legal <b>aid</b> <b>societies</b> and lawyer referral plans are providing more people in the low and middle classes with legal services, there still is a failure to provide legal services for the middle class. A detailed consideration of group legal service plans case law is then developed in an effort to demonstrate how acceptable such plans are to the courts. The second portion of the article is devoted to a critical analysis of why the legal <b>aid</b> <b>societies</b> and lawyer referral plans are so widely accepted when group legal service plans are struggling for recognition. Of particular importance is a discussion of the old Canons of Ethics and the new Code of Professional Responsibility. It is shown that the American Bar Association and the legal profession in general have seen fit to make express provisions in the new Code to accommodate legal <b>aid</b> <b>societies</b> and lawyer referral plans. Particular attention is given to the absence of adequate provisions in the Code of Professional Responsibility to support group legal service plans...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the business models being used by medical <b>aid</b> <b>societies</b> in order to survive in a turbulent economic environment experienced by Zimbabwe between 2005 and 2013. The turbulent economic environment caused operational difficulties for most medical <b>aid</b> <b>societies</b> like failure to meet claims costs, diversification into questionable non core activities and skyrocketing costs of doing business. These challenges threatened the long term survival of societies, therefore the study delved deep to understand what can be done to guarantee long term survival of the societies. The research followed a positivist or quantitative research philosophy. A deductive approach was used. The study used a survey research strategy and the time horizon was cross-sectional as opposed to longitudinal. The study had a population of about 36 650 people and a sample of 200 people received questionnaires. The respondents were split across medical aid subscribers, employees, shareholders and managers of various medical <b>aid</b> <b>societies.</b> The sample was arrived at using the stratified random and convenience sampling techniques. The study relied on primary sources of data. Collected data was analyzed by the SPSS software.
