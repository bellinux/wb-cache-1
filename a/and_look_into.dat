5|$|Eliot {{believed}} that Burnt Norton could benefit society. The poem's narration reflects on how humankind {{is affected by}} Original Sin, that they can follow the paths of either good or evil, {{and that they can}} atone for their sins. To help the individual, the poem explains that people must leave the time-bound world <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>into</b> their selves, and that poets must seek out a perfection, not bound by time in their images, to escape from the problems of language.|$|E
25|$|St James Park, {{most likely}} named after its road frontage, is {{predominantly}} used for croquet, cricket and soccer. It {{is probably one}} of the most beautiful parks in the city with tree lined walkways and gardens. The park in the heart of Papanui is probably the best location to see over-wintering monarch butterflies. On a warm sunny late autumn or early winter's day head to the children's play ground <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>into</b> the largely leafless old trees. There you will see monarchs clustering together often holding on to the remaining leaves for support. It ís a great spot for a picnic beneath the trees with monarchs fluttering in the air above.|$|E
25|$|The votes {{challenged}} by Miller's team {{were put in}} separate boxes, leaving it to the lawsuit {{to decide whether they}} would be counted for Murkowski. On November 11, the Miller campaign alleged it had received reports of voter intimidation and fraud {{and that it would be}} filing a lawsuit in Alaska state court asking for voters rolls for certain precincts to determine whether the precincts had counted more ballots than there were registered voters. Miller told Fox News Channel on November 18 that his campaign may request a recount, investigate the voting machines, <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>into</b> whether the absentee ballots for the military were mailed in a timely fashion. The federal judge held the suit could be decided by reference to State law, and directed Miller to file in State court, which he did on November 22, stopping the certification of election results and possibly delaying the seating of a second Senator for Alaska at the beginning of the new term in January.|$|E

25|$|Teoh {{was engaged}} to 28-year-old teacher Soh Cher Wei after a two-year courtship, and had been {{planning}} to register his marriage with her the day following his death. A photo shoot on the same day, followed by a honeymoon and wedding reception in October had also been planned. At the time of Teoh's death, Soh was two months pregnant; she told the press she intended to keep the child. National Registration Department regulations only allow a father's name to be included on the birth certificate if he is physically present {{at the time of}} birth; after this was publicised through the press, Women, Family and Community Development Minister Shahrizat Abdul Jalil said she would ask the NRD to look into the matter. Shahrizat also stated her ministry would assist in transferring Soh from her current school to one closer to her hometown, <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>into</b> assisting Teoh's family since he was their sole breadwinner.|$|E

500|$|... "Boyz 4 Now" [...] {{was written}} by Lizzie and Wendy Molyneux and {{directed}} by Anthony Chun. Upon hearing the writers' pitch of the episode, series creator Loren Bouchard found its plot to be [...] "such an immediately appealing story" [...] and [...] "a great way to have Louise peek over {{the other side of}} adolescence <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>into</b> the abyss." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Bouchard cited [...] "Boyz 4 Now" [...] as one of his favorite episodes of the series and revealed his liking of [...] "episodes where Louise is a little vulnerable...you don't want her to be as invulnerable as she pretends to be. If you try to keep the show grounded, then you periodically have to say, she's a nine-year-old girl." [...] He added that while the character has [...] "an adult sensibility about a lot of stuff," [...] he and the writing staff try to [...] "look for ways to bring her back down to earth," [...] citing the episode's depiction of Louise [...] "fighting against growing up," [...] with Tina acting as [...] "her strange ambassador into that world...in some ways, you couldn't ask for a better guide." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 2007 {{fighters from}} the Ogaden National Liberation Front, {{a group of}} ethnic Somalis seeking {{independence}} from Ethiopia attacked workers at an exploratory oilfield in Abole, a small town about 120km south of Jijiga in eastern Ethiopia. They killed about 65 Ethiopian and nine Chinese workers, and kidnapped another seven Chinese. The oilfield {{is run by a}} subsidiary of the government-owned China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (Sinopec). A Sinopec spokesperson said that the incident would not discourage the firm from further exploration. The Chinese Foreign Ministry avoided discussing the attackers' motives beyond stating that they were [...] attempting to sabotage China's relationship with Ethiopia.

2500|$|Broederlam's use of {{oil paint}} had a strong impact on the {{painters}} of the following generation, including Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck. Both panels include two scenes, with an extensive landscape, <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>into</b> pavilion-like buildings in a manner derived from Italy. Although the perspective is far from fully developed, light and shadow are {{used to create a}} sense of depth in a very advanced fashion, and the realistic depiction of Saint Joseph was to become characteristic of Netherlandish painting. Although the skies are painted in gold in the Dijon panels, a flying hawk in one shows they are intended as real space. The buildings in the Annunciation combine Romanesque and Gothic areas, probably intended to contrast the Old and New Testaments, in a visual metaphor that was to become characteristic of Eyckian painting. The panels contain much of the contemporary International Gothic but also [...] "announce a new world of naturalism and disguised symbolism that will be further refined in the works of his successors in the Netherlands." ...|$|E
