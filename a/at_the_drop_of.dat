During the nine years the district existed, it returned three members through three elections who served roughly three-year terms.|$|E

25|$|As a {{young man}} Flanders seemed to be heading for a {{successful}} acting career. He contracted polio in 1943 while serving in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve {{and for the rest}} of his life was reliant on a wheelchair. He made a career as a prolific broadcaster on radio and later television, and together with his old schoolfriend, the composer Donald Swann, he wrote successful songs in the late 1940s and early and mid-1950s for revues in the West End of London. In 1956 they themselves performed some of these songs, along with new songs, in a two-man revue, <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>Drop</b> <b>of</b> a Hat. This show, and its successor, <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>Drop</b> <b>of</b> Another Hat, ran with occasional short breaks from 1956 to 1967 and played in theatres throughout the British Isles, the US, Australia and elsewhere.|$|E

[...] That the film's initial success depended largely on word-of-mouth was also {{a source of pride}} for the director.

Usually deployed on the right wing, Robben often cuts inside on his left foot to move to a more central attacking position, and uses his speed and dribbling skills to take on defenders until he finds the space to make an attempt on goal.|$|E

[...] However, the control Mottola exerted over her career soon [...] "spilled into her personal life" [...] once they were married, increasing the amount of conflict between the two. Soon, it was obvious that their marriage was in shambles; as stated in a Vanity Fair article, [...] "the couple began to argue <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> a hat." [...] Carey was very involved in the project, more so than she had ever been on an album. [...] "I went into this phase of recording, recording, recording and doing it really fast," [...] she told Time. [...] "This time, I had more time, and I focused more on what I wanted to do." [...] As Carey's career and work continued to reflect her views on how it should sound, her marriage to Mottola continued to [...] "deteriorate".|$|E

500|$|We met land crabs, too, {{and were}} sadly disappointed. They were small, {{no larger than}} an {{ordinary}} edible crab, with bloated shells and moderately long pincers. Some were of beetroot purple, others yellow or orange, apparently two colour-phases of the same species. They were shy, freezing with pincers erect when alarmed, usually to be found within a short distance of their burrows and ready to scuttle down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> a hat. In rainy weather they promenaded more freely, sometimes appearing {{at the side of}} road with arms waving like diminutive but aggressive hitch-hikers. Fringed mandibles [...] suggest a permanently turned-down mouth, giving them a disgruntled, unhappy expression; they were disagreeable rather than sinister and fell far short of their reputation. The first land crab I met was sitting in a prickly pear bush, sadly munching one of the brilliant red fruits and dribbling juice. I could never take them seriously after that.|$|E
500|$|IndieWire's Ben Travers praised Legion as [...] "the most intricate, {{intimate}} superhero {{story to}} date", highlighting {{its focus on}} [...] "an emotional journey for our leading lad", the central love story that turns the show [...] "from a 12 Monkeys mind-fuck to a Romeo & Juliet romance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> a hat", and its cast. At Variety, Maureen Ryan stated that Stevens' performance [...] "is the glue that keeps Legion from flying apart", {{and the relationship between}} Haller and Barrett provides [...] "moments of solace in a viewing experience that can otherwise be exceptionally intense." [...] After the first three episodes, Ryan said that [...] "the challenge of Legion will be to make David’s quest for wholeness {{more than the sum of}} its flashy and often captivating parts. But the humane core of the drama offers a reason to hope for the best." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "It might seem weird to have a Marvel show on FX, or to have it star that upper-crust Brit from Downton Abbey, filtered through the creator of Fargo, but somehow it all works." [...] He praised Stevens performance, and Hawley's [...] "optical hijinks" [...] even after the first episode, where the story starts to become more clear.|$|E
500|$|Referring to Columbia, Carey {{said in an}} {{interview}} [...] "That company, made a billion dollars from the raggedy girl he met at that party." [...] Throughout the marriage, Mottola, both Carey's husband and boss, carefully manipulated and controlled her career, crafting her into the adult contemporary/pop singer he sought her to be. With each album, Carey's genre influences and production styles evolved, leading her farther into R and hip-hop territory. By 1994, Carey was already the best-selling artist of the 1990s, and the labels best-selling act. Due to her continued success, Carey was able to take more creative control over subsequent projects. During the recording sessions for her fifth album Daydream (1995), the couple had already begun [...] "fighting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> a feather", due to his controlling nature over their personal life and her career. They separated in 1997, and divorced the following year. Carey described her sixth album Butterfly (1997) as her magnum opus, and her greatest and most personal work, due to its personal and emotional background. On the album's title track– written by Carey for Mottola– Carey reached out to him, asking to allow her to be free like a 'butterfly', and if the two were 'meant to be', then the butterfly 'would return'. In {{an interview}} with Interview magazine, Carey described the importance the song held for her, as well as its meaning: ...|$|E
