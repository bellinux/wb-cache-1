50|$|In 1910 Haldane was {{appointed}} Scottish Commissioner under the Development Fund Act. His practice {{had given him}} some knowledge of estate management, including forestry, and it was forestry that particularly interested him as a Development Commissioner. In collaboration with Sir Sainthill Eardley-Wilmot, who had been Inspector-General of Forests in India, he prepared a scheme <b>for</b> <b>the</b> development of forestry in Britain. It included {{the establishment of a}} Forestry Research Institute and a generous provision of funds <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>afforestation</b> of waste lands under departmental control, and it was supported by the Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Rowland Prothero, afterwards Lord Ernle. The scheme was, however, thought to be too rigid by the Scottish lairds, led by Lord Lovat, and their view prevailed when the plan was referred to a Cabinet committee; the result was the establishment of the present Forestry Commission.|$|R
