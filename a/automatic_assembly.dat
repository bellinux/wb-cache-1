40|$|A {{previously}} developed {{method of}} automatically selecting items {{for inclusion in}} a test subject to constraints on item content and statistical properties is applied to real data. Two tests are first assembled by experts in test construction who normally assemble such tests on a routine basis. Using the same pool of items and constraints articulated by test construction experts the same two tests'are reassembled automatically. The manual and <b>automatic</b> <b>assemblies</b> are compared by test specialists who {{were not involved in}} the original manual assembly. Based on this experiment, barriers to future progress in the improvement of <b>automatic</b> test <b>assembly</b> methods seem not to be in the development of different algorithms, nor in the improvement of computer time and cost. Rather, the focus of future improvements in the process of <b>automatic</b> test <b>assembly</b> lies more in the direction of complete specifications of constraints on item selection and detailed coding of item properties.

5000|$|Starting in 1977, Geoff Boothroyd, {{supported}} by an NSF grant at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, developed the Design for Assembly method (DFA), {{which could be}} used to estimate the time for manual assembly of a product and the cost of assembling the product on an <b>automatic</b> <b>assembly</b> machine. [...] Recognizing that {{the most important factor in}} reducing assembly costs was the minimization of the number of separate parts in a product, he introduced three simple criteria {{which could be used}} to determine theoretically whether any of the parts in the product could be eliminated or combined with other parts. These criteria, together with tables relating assembly time to various design factors influencing part grasping, orientation and insertion, could be used to estimate total assembly time and to rate the quality of a product design from an assembly viewpoint. For <b>automatic</b> <b>assembly,</b> tables of factors could be used to estimate the cost of automatic feeding and orienting and automatic insertion of the parts on an assembly machine.|$|E

The method was originally developed in order to rate assemblies for ease of <b>automatic</b> <b>assembly.</b>|$|E

5000|$|It is {{the inauguration}} of the new factory with crowds of dignitaries and workers assembled. Louis gives a speech extolling its virtues of productivity. A deaf old man cuts the ribbon, and a chorus sings a slow march, [...] "Gloire au bonheur" [...] = [...] "Hail to happiness," [...] as the <b>automatic</b> <b>assembly</b> line {{produces}} portable phonographs. Another speaker begins a speech, while Louis sees the policeman. The policeman has realized that Louis is an escaped ex-convict, and patiently waits for the festivities to end to apprehend him. Louis makes a concluding speech in which he gives the factory to the workers, and says that fate will take him to a different place. As another speaker continues, a wind begins to pick up, gently blowing the decorations. It also gradually begins to blow the money that was in Louis's suitcase, still sitting {{on the roof of}} the factory. Gradually, bills appear on the factory grounds, testing everyone's propriety, as they look frustrated at not wanting to appear uncivilized by bending down to pick up the money. But Louis has no inhibitions: He immediately recognizes what and where the money is and begins going after it. This in turn launches everyone into a chase after the money. The scene turns to a merry chaos as the dignitaries in top hats wildly chase after money.|$|E
