The art and atmosphere were influenced by science fiction books such as Dune, artists such as Michael Whelan, and comic illustrators such as Richard Corben.

5|$|Before {{going to}} London Grainger had {{composed}} numerous Kipling settings, {{and his first}} mature orchestral pieces. In London, when he found time he continued to compose; a letter to Balfour Gardiner dated 21 July 1901 indicates that {{he was working on}} his Marching Song of Democracy (a Walt Whitman setting), and had made good progress with the experimental works Train Music <b>and</b> <b>Charging</b> Irishrey. In his early London years he also composed Hill Song Number 1 (1902), an instrumental piece much admired by Busoni.|$|E
5|$|Eugene Harold Krabs is {{commonly}} known as the greedy founder and owner of the Krusty Krab restaurant, where SpongeBob works as a fry cook and Squidward works as a cashier. The restaurant's success is built on little competition and the popularity of the Krusty Krab's signature sandwich, the Krabby Patty, the formula to which is a closely guarded trade secret. Mr. Krabs frequently exploits his restaurant's popularity, engaging in price gouging <b>and</b> <b>charging</b> his own employees for use of the building's services.|$|E

First, the Stefan-Maxwell multicomponent diffusion theory is introduced, along with constitutive laws for chemical and electrochemical potential.

40|$|The cell-surface <b>charge</b> <b>and</b> cell-surface {{hydrophobicity}} of 10 {{strains of}} Azospirillum spp. {{were evaluated by}} the aqueous, two-polymer phase partitioning assay. Azospirillum spp. had moderate cell-surface hydrophobicity <b>and</b> <b>charge,</b> lower than known values for human pathogens. The hydrophobicity <b>and</b> <b>charge</b> values were higher in solid than in liquid media. A general pattern of modifying hydrophobicity <b>and</b> <b>charge</b> by external treatments of the cells of all strains was not found, but various chemicals, temperatures, and enzymatic treatments changed the cell-surface hydrophobicity <b>and</b> <b>charge</b> in different strains. A similar hydrophobic protein was isolated, and partially characterized, from two strains of A. brasilense and one strain of A. lipoferum. This study proposes: (i) cell-surface hydrophobicity <b>and</b> <b>charge</b> of Azospirillum spp. can be affected by external treatments of the bacterium cell, and (ii) hydrophobicity <b>and</b> <b>charge</b> may play a role, perhaps small, in the primary adsorption of Azospirillum spp. to surfaces...|$|R

5|$|Prior to the Presidential Election of 1872 two {{congressional and}} one Treasury Department {{investigations}} {{took place over}} corruption at the New York Custom House under Grant collector appointments Moses H. Grinnell and Thomas Murphy. Private warehouses were taking imported goods from the docks <b>and</b> <b>charging</b> shippers storage fees. Grant's friend, George K. Leet, was allegedly involved with exorbitant pricing for storing goods and splitting the profits. Grant's third collector appointment, Chester A. Arthur, implemented Secretary of Treasury George S.

5|$|In 2008 the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Texas City Safe Street Task Force, the Galveston County Sheriff's Office, {{and other}} {{agencies}} started {{an investigation into the}} gang.

In 2011 the Federal Government of the United States arrested four men from Bacliff, accusing {{to be a part of}} the gang <b>and</b> <b>charging</b> them crimes related to crack cocaine distribution.

50|$|For example, {{a theory}} of the {{electron}} may begin by postulating a mass <b>and</b> <b>charge.</b> However, in quantum field theory this electron {{is surrounded by a}} cloud of possibilities of other virtual particles such as photons, which interact with the original electron. Taking these interactions into account shows that the electron-system in fact behaves as if it had a different mass <b>and</b> <b>charge.</b> Renormalization replaces the originally postulated mass <b>and</b> <b>charge</b> with new numbers such that the observed mass <b>and</b> <b>charge</b> matches those originally postulated.|$|R

5|$|USB Battery Charging {{defines a}} new port type, the {{charging}} port, {{as opposed to}} the standard downstream port (SDP) of the base specification. Charging ports are divided into 2 further types: the charging downstream port (CDP), which has data signals, and the dedicated charging port (DCP), which does not. Dedicated charging ports can be found on USB power adapters that convert utility power or another power source (e.g., a car's electrical system) to run attached devices and battery packs. On a host (such as a laptop computer) with both standard <b>and</b> <b>charging</b> USB ports, the charging ports should be labeled as such.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{consequent}} Roman efforts to subjugate all of Germania, the member tribes of the Suebi alliance became displaced, moved east, conquered the Celtic tribes that stood in their way and settled, the Quadi in Moravia, and the Marcomanni in Bohemia. The latter tribe, under Marbod, formed a quasi-state with a huge army and was able to conquer the Lugii tribal association among others. What archeologists see as the Przeworsk culture, by this period (early 1st century AD) is believed to consist first of all of the Lugii tribes. A Roman defeat in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest (9 AD) stabilized the situation at the periphery of the Empire to some degree. The Lugii and other tribes on Polish lands increasingly became involved in trade and other contacts, through the Marcomanni and Quadi intermediaries, with the Danubian provinces of Rome. The Lugii, according to Tacitus, was a very large union of tribes. In 50 AD they invaded and pillaged the Quadi state created by Vannius, contributing to its fall. The motivation for the expedition were the rumours of the enormous riches that Vannius had accumulated by plunder <b>and</b> <b>charging</b> duties. In 93 AD the Lugii, fighting a war with the Suebi, asked Emperor Domitian for help, and received one hundred mounted soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The city finally fell on {{the morning}} of 21 May 878, after nine months of siege. The {{defenders}} had withdrawn to the walls to rest and breakfast, leaving a small guard to hold the breach under a certain John Patrianos, when the Arabs launched a sudden attack, firing all their siege engines at once <b>and</b> <b>charging</b> the breach. By the time the patrikios came forth to rally the defence, the Arabs had killed the defenders of the breach and broken through into the city. A detachment that tried to blockade the way near the Church of the Saviour was likewise annihilated; Theodosios writes that the Arabs entered the church, where much of the populace had sought refuge, and massacred them all. The patrikios was left with some 70 men to hold an isolated tower, until he was forced to surrender the next day. Theodosios himself was assisting the liturgy in the cathedral when news of the city's fall came, and was taken prisoner along with the archbishop. Unlike the Church of the Saviour, the Arab soldiers did not mistreat them, but forced the archbishop to reveal the location of the sacristy where the precious liturgical objects where held.|$|E

5|$|Though Henry Beecher's Lawrenceburg church {{declared}} {{its independence from}} the Synod to retain him as its pastor, the poverty that followed the Panic of 1837 caused him {{to look for a}} new position. Banker Samuel Merrill invited Beecher to visit Indianapolis in 1839, and he was offered the ministry of the Second Presbyterian Church there on May 13, 1839. Unusually for a speaker of his era, Beecher would use humor and informal language including dialect and slang as he preached. His preaching was a major success, building Second Presbyterian into the largest church in the city, and he also led a successful revival meeting in nearby Terre Haute. However, mounting debt led to Beecher again seeking a new position in 1847, and he accepted the invitation of businessman Henry Bowen to head a new Plymouth Congregational Church in Brooklyn, New York. Beecher's national fame continued to grow, and he took to the lecture circuit, becoming {{one of the most popular}} speakers in the country <b>and</b> <b>charging</b> correspondingly high fees.|$|E
