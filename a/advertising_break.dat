25|$|When {{the fifteen}} round format was first {{introduced}} in September 2001, {{the composition of the}} rounds was different from that used by the programme today. The three sections each had five rounds, four letters rounds and one numbers round in each of the first two sections, with three letters rounds, one numbers round and the conundrum in the third section. This meant that there was a slight imbalance, whereby one contestant made the letters sections for six rounds, but had the choice of the numbers selection just once, whereas the other contestant chose letters five times and numbers twice. The dictionary corner guest's spot was immediately before the first <b>advertising</b> <b>break,</b> and Susie Dent's Origin of Words spot preceded the second numbers game shortly before the second break. The change to the present format was made on 25 March 2013, three weeks into the second section of Series 68, to comply with Channel 4's decision {{to increase the amount of}} adverts and alter the times when they occur during the programme, therefore reducing Countdown's actual show length from 36 to 35 minutes.|$|E
500|$|One scene {{involving}} the Teselecta (disguised as a German soldier) chasing Amy and Rory on motorcycles through Berlin {{was cut from}} filming due to budget issues. AT, who wanted to advertise in the United States broadcast of the episode on BBC America as a tie-in to their [...] "Rethink possible" [...] slogan, brought {{the idea of using}} a motion comic to create a bridging scene within the <b>advertising</b> <b>break</b> where this scene would have been placed. AT and BBC America worked with Moffat and Senior to create the 60 second scene, which was animated by Double Barrel Motion Labs.|$|E
50|$|In Australia, a break-bumper {{can be a}} brief {{appearance}} of a programme logo, animated logo, title card or an animated title card, just before an <b>advertising</b> <b>break.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{vignette}} {{that appeared}} in {{the beginning and end of}} each Idol episode and also before and after each <b>advertising</b> <b>break</b> was updated. Between 2005 and 2008, it was a rapper who told who sponsored the program.|$|E
50|$|A {{television}} timeout (alternately TV timeout or media timeout) is a {{break in}} a televised live event to allow television advertisements to be shown. This allows commercial broadcasters to take an <b>advertising</b> <b>break</b> without causing viewers to miss part of the action.|$|E
50|$|The {{bulletin}} usually {{runs for}} 30 minutes, including an <b>advertising</b> <b>break</b> which divides the broadcast in two. RTÉ's news format is heavily modelled on the BBC - it places {{less emphasis on}} set and graphics than bulletins on ITV News or Sky News.|$|E

40|$|The {{business}} model of many commercial TV-networks is to interrupt TV programs with <b>advertising</b> <b>breaks.</b> In this paper we investigate {{consequences of the}} fact that ad-averse viewers today can adopt technology which enables them to skip the <b>advertising</b> <b>breaks.</b> Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, we find that the ad-avoidance technology can make TV networks and the advertisers better off. The viewers as a group however, are always worse off when we take into account their costs associated with adopting the technology...|$|R
50|$|Following {{the switch}} to an {{automated}} service, spot <b>advertising</b> <b>breaks</b> on The Arrow ceased for a time: advertisements returned to The Arrow in late 2016.|$|R
5000|$|The {{character}} Bully was ambidextrous. In {{the opening}} credits of the show, he {{was shown to}} throw his darts with his right hand; however, prior to the <b>advertising</b> <b>break</b> midway through the show, he could be seen to write [...] "End of part one" [...] using his left hand.|$|E
50|$|The pilot {{episode was}} filmed in April 2012. Then it was watched {{by a group}} of people similar to the profile of the typical Polsat's viewer. The study found that people are willing to come back to it after an <b>advertising</b> <b>break.</b> A {{positive}} test result was reflected in the 13 episodes that filmed from July to September 2012.|$|E
50|$|The Russian <b>advertising</b> <b>break</b> {{consists}} of 2 parts: federal adverts and regional adverts. The duration for each is 4 minutes and 15 minutes per hour respectively. Like Greece, Russia {{is one of}} the few countries where the television channel's logo is retained during the commercial break. In Russia, tobacco advertising is prohibited, and in 2013, this was followed suit by alcohol and medication advertising.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom, a break-bumper {{is a brief}} {{appearance}} of a logo before or after <b>advertising</b> <b>breaks,</b> usually that of the television channel being watched.|$|R
50|$|Public {{information}} films (PIFs) are {{a series}} of government commissioned short films, shown during television <b>advertising</b> <b>breaks</b> in the United Kingdom. The US equivalent is the public service announcement (PSA).|$|R

5000|$|... "But the {{condition}} was that Akhalaia {{should have been}} last guest of the program; such conditions are absolutely unacceptable for me. Also I think that when such a murder to the Girgvliani's case occurs in the country the Interior Minister should at least resign. So {{this is my last}} program and I quit this channel 2." [...] After the statement, Khoperia announced an <b>advertising</b> <b>break,</b> but the programme did not resume.|$|E
5000|$|The {{production}} assistant (PA) occupies a prompting {{role in the}} Gallery or Control Room. They communicate with the broadcasting channel during a live television broadcast, counting down time-to-transmission aloud to the crew via the studio microphone. They also count down time remaining for sections of a programme, such as an interview or an <b>advertising</b> <b>break.</b> Prior to a production, the PA prepares and times the script, noting pre-recorded inserts, sound effects, etc.—and clears copyright and other administrative issues.|$|E
50|$|The finalé {{was itself}} a spoof {{of the film}} The Graduate. Wearing a dress by Deborah Milner and a hairstyle by Nicky Clarke, with her ring {{designed}} by Stephen Webster, Nicole was led down the aisle to the as yet unseen groom. Played during the <b>advertising</b> <b>break</b> for Coronation Street on 29 May 1998, an estimated 23 million viewers watched Nicole leave Vic Reeves at the altar, and {{start a new life}} with Bob Mortimer in his new Renault Clio.|$|E
50|$|The Box 2000 slots would {{advertise}} {{local community}} groups and charities within the STV broadcasting area. Typically, they lasted {{up to one}} minute and were shown within <b>advertising</b> <b>breaks</b> or during continuity announcements.|$|R

50|$|The {{programme}} {{was first}} broadcast on Channel 4 on 2 October 2009 at 9 pm, and later made {{available on the}} channel's catch-up service, 4oD; it ran for one hour, including three <b>advertising</b> <b>breaks.</b> According to BARB, the special was viewed by 2.18 million people.|$|R
50|$|A new {{sequence}} called C à vous la suite (The next of C à vous), {{which is}} the next part of the show, has been broadcast since August 2010. This sequence lasts around 12 minutes and presents the dessert guest, who joins the dinner guest(s). It usually ends with a live song. From August 2010 to May 2013, it was broadcast at 8.25 p.m. Since June 2013, it has been broadcast at 8 p.m. after the main show, but with a short <b>advertising</b> <b>break</b> between them.|$|E
5000|$|After an <b>advertising</b> <b>break,</b> Derren speaks over {{a map of}} Europe, {{saying that}} they cannot film due {{to the risk of}} their {{location}} being recognised. In another pre-recorded segment, Brown explores the concept of luck and the notion that [...] "lucky" [...] people are those who take more opportunities. He plays a game involving two audience members involving two matchboxes and a £20 note: the unlucky person ends up with it, but an instruction to give it to the other person is written on the note.|$|E
5000|$|One scene {{involving}} the Teselecta (disguised as a German soldier) chasing Amy and Rory on motorcycles through Berlin {{was cut from}} filming due to budget issues.

5000|$|The {{logistics}} {{of the local}} rights holder having to clear up to four hours of air time (some of which may have already been sold for infomercials) for the game, and sell all of the local <b>advertising</b> <b>breaks,</b> within a five-day notice also played into the move to an ABC deal.|$|R
50|$|As TV4 is {{broadcast}} from Sweden, {{it has to}} follow much tighter advertising rules than its main competitors, Modern Times Group (TV3) and ProSiebenSat.1 Media (Kanal 5). Initially {{this meant that the}} TV4 Group was not allowed to include <b>advertising</b> <b>breaks,</b> meaning that the advertising had to be put in between the programmes.|$|R
25|$|Each {{participating}} broadcaster {{is required}} to broadcast the show in its entirety: including all songs, recap, voting and reprise, skipping only the interval act for <b>advertising</b> <b>breaks</b> if they wish. From 1999 onwards, broadcasters who wished to do so were {{given the opportunity to}} take more <b>advertising</b> <b>breaks</b> as short, non-essential hiatuses were introduced into the programme. Three major interruptions or preemptions of the contest broadcast have taken place since 1999. The Dutch state broadcaster pulled their broadcast of the 2000 final to provide emergency news coverage of a major incident, the Enschede fireworks disaster. Spain's RTVE delayed their broadcast of the second semi-final in the 2009 Contest, due to the Madrid Open tennis tournament. The Albanian state broadcaster deferred their broadcast of the first semi-final in 2012 to provide emergency news coverage of the Qafa e Vishës bus accident.|$|R
5000|$|Footage {{from early}} September, when Brown asked the museum's curator to paint and wrap the design, is shown. After the film, Derren talks to Katie, {{who is in}} an {{isolation}} tank in an unknown location, and says that she will [...] "mentally project" [...] the image to viewers; the camera zooms in to her eyes. He tells viewers, and a crowd in the museum, to draw what they imagine the design (which he says {{is likely to be}} [...] "shapes interacting") to be, during the following <b>advertising</b> <b>break.</b> After the break, Brown asks viewers to stop drawing, and says that museum staff will now examine the suggestions of the crowd and those left by visitors.|$|E
5000|$|Tales From Te Papa is a {{television}} series of mini-documentaries about {{objects from the}} collection of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (Te Papa) and the activities of the Museum staff. The series is a partnership between Television New Zealand and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. [...] The series was commissioned by Television New Zealand for TVNZ6, a digital channel and New Zealand's first fully public service broadcasting channel without advertising breaks. [...] Each episode runs for 5 to 8 minutes and shows on rotation in what would be the <b>advertising</b> <b>break</b> between programmes. Since TVNZ6 changed format to TVNZU on 1 March 2011 the series has moved to TVNZ7.|$|E
50|$|RTP {{introduced}} DOGs in {{the late}} 1980s, when {{it was at the}} time, the only broadcaster in Portugal that operated two television channels. Initially were placed on top-right corner but moved in 1991 to top-left corner permanently which is the most common place in Portugal. Until 2004, before RTP1's rebranding, DOGs were also placed on bottom-left corner during newscasts. On some programs or live sport broadcasting, DOGs are placed on top-right corner. Logos are removed during <b>advertising</b> <b>break</b> and trailers. For information of subtitles, in RTP1 and RTP2, a text is put: 884, 885, 886, 887 or 888. And in other cases, near the logo, Direto (Live) is put sometimes instead of 88x. And some programmes use neither 88x nor Direto (Live), Gravado (Recorded) or Repetição (Repetition).|$|E
50|$|Since 2010, {{only the}} American {{ceremony}} {{has been presented}} on the network, usually with a one-day delay, with local-specific awards given during <b>advertising</b> <b>breaks</b> as continuity which is hosted by Nickelodeon UK presenters. In 2015 with the acquisition of broadcast network Channel 5 by Viacom, an encore was carried {{a week after the}} original Nickelodeon UK airing free-to-air.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{channels}} broadcasting primarily to Sweden do not actually broadcast from Sweden itself. This is principally to allow these channels to circumvent the strict regulation of broadcast advertising in Sweden (<b>advertising</b> <b>breaks</b> were illegal until 2002). The main channels targeting Sweden, but not broadcasting from there, are TV3 and Kanal 5, {{both of which are}} broadcast from London in the UK.|$|R
50|$|Broadcasts {{commenced}} on June 25, 2002, at 20:35. The {{first show}} {{seen on the}} new channel was Nashe Novosti (Our News), ONT's main news programme. The first edition was hosted by Alexander Averkov. Initially it relayed ORT's programming {{most of the time}} with significant differences in <b>advertising</b> <b>breaks</b> and news operation. As the years progressed, the channel added more original content.|$|R
