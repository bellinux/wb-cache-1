40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{earnings}} quality by investigating {{the quality of}} accruals using the approach introduced by Dechow & Dichev (2002). One essential element {{is the role of}} accrual estimation errors, and another is whether the equity market impounds information about the quality of earnings. The basic assumption is that the quality of accruals and earnings is decreasing as the magnitude of estimation errors in the accruals is increasing. The paper contributes to the literature on accrual (and earnings) quality by investigating not only the quality of aggregated accruals but also the quality of some more specific company key accruals, where especially the two balance sheet <b>accounts,</b> <b>inventory</b> and accounts receivable, are of interest. This is documented and discussed by relating empirical measures {{of the quality of the}} different specific key-accruals as well as aggregated accruals quality vs. observable firm characteristics (e. g. volatility of accruals and earnings, etc.). Further, since an analysis of this type in general can be said to be somewhat mechanical, it is also investigated whether and how, the equity market (e. g. observable earnings-price-ratios) impounds information about the quality of the different accruals and earnings.

40|$|Part 1 : KeynoteInternational audienceDigital {{information}} {{within an}} enterprise consists of (1) structured data and (2) unstructured content. The structured data includes enterprise and business data like sales, customers, products, <b>accounts,</b> <b>inventory</b> and enterprise assets, etc. while the content includes contracts, reports, emails, customer opinions, transcribed calls, on-line inquires, complements and complaints. Further, cutting edge businesses also using GPS tracking or surveillance monitors {{as well as}} sensor technologies for productivity, performance and efficiency measures, and these are provided by outsourcers etc. Similarly in the Biomedical area, resources can be structured data say in Swiss- Prot or unstructured text information in journal articles stored in content repositories such as PubMed. The structured data and the unstructured content generally reside in entirely separate repositories with the former being managed by a DBMS and the latter by a content manager frequently provided by an outsourcer or vendor [76]. This separation is undesirable since the information content of these sources is complementary. Further, each outsourcer or vendor keep the data on their own Cloud, and data are not sharable between the vendor systems, and most vendor system were not integrated with the enterprise systems, and leaves the organization to consolidate the data and information manually for data analytics. Effective knowledge and information use requires seamless access and intelligent analysis of information in its totality to allow enterprises to gain enhanced critical insights. This is becoming even more important, as the proportion of structured to unstructured information has shifted from 50 - 50 in the 1960 s to 5 - 95 today [1]. Unless we can effectively utilize the unstructured content conjointly with the structured data, we will only obtain very limited and shallow knowledge discovery from an increasingly narrow slice of information. The techniques developed in our research will then be used to address significant issues in three application areas, but potential applications with significant impact are much more extensive...|$|E
