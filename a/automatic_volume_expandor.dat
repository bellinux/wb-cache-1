50|$|A plate {{detector}} (or anode-bend detector) is {{a vacuum}} tube detector circuit used in A.M. radios, although {{the term is}} sometimes extended to transistor circuits that similarly rely upon distorted amplification to enhance {{one half of the}} received signal over the other. This circuit employs a tube with an indirectly heated cathode, typically a medium-mu triode, or a tetrode or pentode with a sharp cut-off control grid. Partial rectification of R.F. signals occurs in the plate of the detector tube if it is forced into its non-linear region at roughly the zero crossing point of the input signal. This differs from a grid-leak detector, which achieves rectification in the control grid. It also differs from the diode detector circuit commonly used to provide both R.F. rectification and <b>automatic</b> <b>volume</b> control (A.V.C.) bias to the R.F. amplifier tubes.|$|R
40|$|Quantification {{of blood}} after SAH on initial NCCT is an {{important}} radiologic measure to predict patient outcome and guide treatment decisions. In current scales, hemorrhage volume and density are not accounted for. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop and validate a fully automatic method for SAH volume and density quantification. The automatic method is based on a relative density increase due to the presence of blood from different brain structures in NCCT. The method incorporates density variation due to partial volume effect, beam-hardening, and patient-specific characteristics. For validation, <b>automatic</b> <b>volume</b> and density measurements were compared with manual delineation on NCCT images of 30 patients by 2 radiologists. The agreement with the manual reference was compared with interobserver agreement by using the intraclass correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis for volume and density. The automatic measurement successfully segmented the hemorrhage of all 30 patients and showed high correlation with the manual reference standard for hemorrhage volume (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0. 98 [95 % CI, 0. 96 - 0. 99]) and hemorrhage density (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0. 80 [95 % CI, 0. 62 - 0. 90]) compared with intraclass correlation coefficient = 0. 97 (95 % CI, 0. 77 - 0. 99) and 0. 98 (95 % CI, 0. 89 - 0. 99) for manual interobserver agreement. Mean SAH volume and density were, respectively, 39. 3 ± 31. 5 mL and 62. 2 ± 5. 9 Hounsfield units for automatic measurement versus 39. 7 ± 32. 8 mL and 61. 4 ± 7. 3 Hounsfield units for manual measurement.

30|$|However, on an {{individual}} patient basis, these optimal cutoffs provided, in some patients, wide difference {{as compared to the}} visual method. The limits of agreement between the “optimal” <b>automatic</b> <b>volume</b> and the manual volume were large, −[*] 31.0 and 30.2 % for ventilation images and −[*] 21.1 and 27.8 % for perfusion images, respectively. In addition, the range of volume difference was up to 40.4 % for ventilation images and 35.5 % of WL for perfusion images. This appears unacceptably wide for a quantitative imaging tool of regional lung function. This was confirmed by assessing correlation with PFT parameters. Indeed, correlation was only observed with FEV 1 /FVC and was much lower as compared with the manual segmentation. Using an automatic method of delineation consisting in applying the same threshold for all patients is therefore inaccurate and inappropriate for the determination of lung functional volumes with 68 Ga-V/Q PET/CT.|$|R
50|$|Automatic {{gain control}} (AGC), also called <b>automatic</b> <b>volume</b> control (AVC), is a {{closed-loop}} feedback regulating circuit, {{the purpose of}} which is to provide a controlled signal amplitude at its output, despite variation of the amplitude in the input signal. The average or peak output signal level is used to dynamically adjust the input-to-output gain to a suitable value, enabling the circuit to work satisfactorily with a greater range of input signal levels. It is used in most radio receivers to equalise the average volume (loudness) of different radio stations due to differences in received signal strength, as well as variations in a single station's radio signal due to fading. Without AGC the sound emitted from an AM radio receiver would vary to an extreme extent from a weak to a strong signal; the AGC effectively reduces the volume if the signal is strong and raises it when it is weaker.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In {{perfusion}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging a manual approach to delineation of regions of interest is, due to rater bias and time intensive operator input, clinically less favorable than an automated approach would be. The goal of our study was to compare the performances of these approaches. Methods Using Stroketool, PMA and Perfscape/Neuroscape perfusion maps of cerebral blood flow, mean transit time and Tmax were created for 145 patients with acute ischemic stroke. Volumes of hypoperfused tissue were calculated using both a manual and an automated protocol, and the results compared between methods. Results The median difference between the automatically and manually derived volumes was up to 210 [*]ml in Perfscape/Neuroscape, 123 [*]ml in PMA and 135 [*]ml in Stroketool. Correlation coefficients between perfusion volumes and radiological and clinical outcome were much lower for the <b>automatic</b> <b>volumes</b> than for the manually derived ones. Conclusions The agreement of the two methods was very poor, with the automated use producing falsely exaggerated volumes of hypoperfused tissue. Software improvements are necessary to enable highly automated protocols to credibly assess perfusion deficits. </p...|$|R
