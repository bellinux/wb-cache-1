25|$|Descriptions of {{the time}} vary, but {{generally}} the beast was said {{to look like a}} wolf but be about <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> calf. It had a large dog-like head with small straight ears, a wide chest, and a large mouth that exposed very large teeth. The beast's fur was said to be red in color but its back was streaked with black.|$|E
25|$|Also at {{the base}} of the Chief's walls are a bewildering variety of medium-to-large size granite boulders. Once {{themselves}} part of the Chief, these boulders form groups which have been carefully explored by bouldering enthusiasts. Some of the boulders are so large as to seem like small cliffs in their own right. The largest is the Cacodemon Boulder {{at the base}} of the Grand Wall, an individual chunk of rock <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> small apartment building.|$|E

25|$|I {{remember}} {{just how}} those men looked as we rode up the little hill where their camp was. The red {{light of the}} morning sun was streaming upon them as they lay head towards us on the ground. And every man had a round red spot {{on top of his}} head, about <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> dollar where the redskins had taken his scalp. It was frightful, but it was grotesque, and the red sunlight seemed to paint everything all over. I remember one man had on buckskin breeches.|$|E
25|$|Due to a {{combination}} of resentment of Americans settling {{on the wrong side of}} the treaty line and pressure from the Muscogee, warriors of the Overhill Towns picked up the tomahawk in early July, led by John Watts. They were supported by Cherokee of the Valley Towns, and according to some accounts the army was <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> thousand strong. First attacking a homestead on Beaver Creek near the newly established White's Fort (at the modern Knoxville, Tennessee) on July 20, they dispersed into small parties raiding the upper Holston and other parts of Franklin.|$|E
25|$|During the 20th century, the bay {{was subject}} to the Reber Plan, which would have filled {{in parts of the}} bay in order to {{increase}} industrial activity along the waterfront. In 1959, the United States Army Corps of Engineers released a report stating that if current infill trends continued, the bay would be <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> shipping channel by 2020. This news created the Save the Bay movement in 1960, which mobilized to stop the infill of wetlands and the bay in general, which had shrunk to two-thirds of its size in the century before 1961.|$|E

25|$|Research {{indicates}} that anal sex occurs significantly less frequently than other sexual behaviors, but {{its association with}} dominance and submission, as well as taboo, makes it an appealing stimulus to people of all sexual orientations. In addition to sexual penetration by the penis, people may use sex toys such as butt plugs or anal beads, engage in fingering, anilingus, pegging, anal masturbation or fisting for anal sexual activity, and different sex positions may also be included. Fisting is the least practiced of the activities, partly because it is uncommon that people can relax enough to accommodate an object <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fist being inserted into the anus.|$|E
25|$|German Orientalist, mathematician, inventor, poet, and {{librarian}} Daniel Schwenter {{wrote in}} his 1636 book Deliciae Physico-Mathematicae about an instrument that a man from Pappenheim had shown him, which enabled movement of a lens to project more from a scene through the camera obscura. It consisted of a ball <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fist, through which a hole (AB) was made with a lens attached on one side (B). This ball was placed inside two halves of part of a hollow ball that were then glued together (CD), in which it could be turned around. This device was attached to a wall of the camera obscura (EF). This universal joint mechanism was later called a scioptric ball.|$|E

Later, he returns {{in the form}} of a black, shaggy man, barefoot, with a torn coat. In another episode, he decides to do something that will be spoken of forever. Going into the forest of Brocéliande, he transforms himself into a herdsman carrying a club and wearing a wolf-skin and leggings.

500|$|The {{first song}} to be {{attempted}} was [...] "Killer", {{which came out}} of a rehearsal that attempted to join fragments of songs together in a deliberate attempt to create something that would be commercially successful. The track was a composite of a basic song structure written by group leader Peter Hammill in 1968, an old song written by founding member Judge Smith called [...] "A Cloud <b>as</b> <b>Big</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Man's Hand", and a rock riff composed by organist Hugh Banton that he later said was influenced by The Move's [...] "Brontosaurus".

500|$|The storm {{arrived in}} Pennsylvania as an extratropical cyclone late on September 29, still {{accompanied}} by strong winds that disconnected wires and interrupted communications throughout the state. Property damage was severe in southeastern {{parts of the}} state, especially York and Lancaster counties, where barns were demolished and houses unroofed. Wind gusts in Harrisburg peaked at [...] shortly after midnight. Debris from trees and buildings rained down on the city's streets as the storm produced erratic damage patterns, characterized by distinct two- or three-block gaps in the destruction. Large trees were uprooted [...] "with masses of earth clinging to them <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> room." [...] In all, damage reached $200,000 in Harrisburg. On the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at Philson, two freight trains violently collided, killing six vagrants. Several more train wrecks were attributed to obstructing storm debris. In Steelton, an overpass collapsed onto the tracks of the Pennsylvania Railroad shortly before a train careened through the rubble, damaging the locomotive and several cars. Additionally, two roundhouses were destroyed in Lebanon, with eight locomotives sustaining damage {{in one of the}} structures.|$|E
500|$|The tale was {{the basis}} for a story in The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales by Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith, wherein the prince decides to slip a bowling ball {{underneath}} one hundred mattresses after three years of unsuccessful attempts with the pea. In the morning, the princess comes downstairs and tells the queen, [...] "This might sound odd, but I think you need another mattress. I felt like I was sleeping on a lump <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bowling ball." [...] which satisfies the king and the queen. The princess gets married to the prince, and they live happily, though maybe not completely honestly, ever after. American poet Jane Shore published a poem, [...] "The Princess and the Pea", in the January 1973 issue of Poetry, in which a close dependency between princess and pea is posited: [...] "I lie in my skin as in an ugly coat: / my body owned by the citizens / who ache and turn whenever I turn / on the pea on which so much depends" [...] (13-16). Russian writer Evgeny Shvarts incorporates the story, with two other Andersen stories, in his Naked King.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} known European {{reference to}} the durian is the record of Niccolò Da Conti, who travelled to southeastern Asia in the 15th century. Translated from the Latin in which Poggio Bracciolini recorded Da Conti's travels: [...] "They [...] have a green fruit which they call durian, <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> watermelon. Inside there are five things like elongated oranges, and resembling thick butter, {{with a combination of}} flavours." [...] The Portuguese physician Garcia de Orta described durians in Colóquios dos simples e drogas da India published in 1563. In 1741, Herbarium Amboinense by the German botanist Georg Eberhard Rumphius was published, providing the most detailed and accurate account of durians for over a century. The genus Durio has a complex taxonomy that has seen the subtraction and addition of many species since it was created by Rumphius. During the early stages of its taxonomical study, there was some confusion between durian and the soursop (Annona muricata), for both of these species had thorny green fruit. It is also interesting to note the Malay name for the soursop is durian Belanda, meaning Dutch durian. In the 18th century, Johann Anton Weinmann considered the durian to belong to Castaneae as its fruit was similar to the horse chestnut.|$|E

500|$|Torres {{was called}} up for Spain's Euro 2008 squad, where {{he set up}} Villa to score Spain's first goal of the tournament {{in the first game}} in the group stage against Russia. Torres came under {{criticism}} for apparently refusing to shake the hand of Spanish manager Luis Aragonés after being substituted off. He subsequently denied being angry with the coaching, saying that he was actually [...] "irritated with himself". He scored his first goal of the tournament in Spain's next game, a 2–1 win over Sweden. Torres scored the winner and was named the man of the match in the final against Germany in a 1–0 victory. He said, [...] "It's just a dream come true. This is my first title and I hope it's the first of many. Victory in a Euro, it is almost <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> World Cup.
