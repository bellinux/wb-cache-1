40|$|Abstract — For {{the design}} and {{performance}} evaluation of advanced wireless communication systems employing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technologies, realistic MIMO channel models with a good tradeoff between accuracy and complexity are indispensable. This paper compares the statistical properties of the two latest standardized MIMO channel models: Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) and IMT-Advanced (IMT-A) channel models. Closed-from expressions are derived for the spatial cross-correlation function (CCF), temporal autocorre-lation function (ACF), envelope level-crossing rate (LCR), <b>average</b> <b>fading</b> duration (AFD), power delay profile (PDP), and frequency correlation function (FCF) for both models. Simulation results are provided which can match the corresponding theoretical derivations very well, demonstrating the correctness of both theoretical and simulation results. The LTE-A channel model is simple but has significant flaws {{in terms of the}} accuracy. It can only support system bandwidths up to 50 MHz, not the claimed 100 MHz, and only describes the average spatial-temporal properties of MIMO channels. The IMT-A channel model is complex with more model parameters but has better accuracy.

This paper {{presents}} mobile-to-mobile (M-to-M) channel measurements and models at 1. 85 GHz in dense-scattering suburban areas. Three test scenarios were considered for different transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) antenna placements. Scenario 1 : inside-vehicle-to-inside-vehicle (IV 2 IV), where both Tx and Rx antennas were placed inside the test vehicles; Scenario 2 : inside-vehicle-to-walk (IV 2 W), where the Tx antenna was placed inside the vehicle and the Rx antenna was inside the pocket or next to {{the face of the}} tester; and Scenario 3 : walk-to-walk (W 2 W), where the Tx and Rx were moving at walking speeds, the Tx antenna was placed on a test cart, and the Rx was inside the pocket or next to the face of the tester.

40|$|Abstract: In this work, {{the idea}} of using the channel eigenvectors as the basis for a block based {{signaling}} scheme over a fading multipath channel is introduced. This basis minimizes the product of the <b>average</b> <b>fading</b> attenuations along different dimensions. The IS 1 from the preceding blocks (intra-block ISI) is modeled by an additive Gaussian noise. To reduce the effect of the intra-block ISI, a number of zeros are transmitted between successive blocks. The number of zeros is optimized to minimize the average probability of error. As the transmission of zeros reduces the bandwidth efficiency, this optimization procedure is more useful for lower bit rates. By applying Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) to each dimension, we obtain a set of two-dimensional subchannels with unequal fadings. A coherent M-PSK constellation is employed over each QAM subchannel. We propose two methods to distribute the rate and energy between the subchannels. In both methods, we impose the restriction that the average error probability for all the subchannels is the same. In the optimum method, the energy is distributed equally between the nonempty subchannels and the rate is distributed to obtain equal average error probabilities. In a second method, the rate is distributed equally and the energy is distributed to obtain equal average error probabilities. The second method allows us to use the same modulator/demodulator for all the subchannels and thereby reduces the complexity. Numerical results are presented for the second method. The results over a space of moderate dimensionality show substantial performance improvement with a small increase in the complexity. ...|$|E
