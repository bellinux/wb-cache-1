Bio-fertilizer inoculation with strain Pseudomonas fluorescence strain 843 growth promoting rhizobacteria was significantly improve fruit quality as well as increased fruit yield, fruit weight, fruit length, TSS and juice volumes, while inoculation with strain Azospirillum brasilence strain W 24 increase but not significantly improve fruit quantity and quality of Washington navel orange. Commonly, three types of nematode were detected in the roots including Tylenchulus Spp, saprophytic nematode and Pratylenchulus while the dominant species was Tylenchulus semipenetrans.

40|$|Azospirillum is a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR) able {{to enhance}} growth and yield of cereals such as rice, maize and wheat. The growth-promoting ability of some Azospirillum strains {{appears to be}} highly {{specific}} to certain plant species and cultivars. In order to ascertain the specificity of the associative symbiosis between rice and Azospirillum, the physiological response of two rice cultivars, Nipponbare and Cigalon, inoculated with two rice-associated Azospirillum was analyzed at two levels: plant growth response and plant secondary metabolic response. Each strain of Azospirillum (<b>Azospirillum</b> lipoferum 4 <b>B</b> isolated from Cigalon and <b>Azospirillum</b> sp. <b>B</b> 510 isolated from Nipponbare) preferentially increased growth of the cultivar from which it was isolated. This specific effect {{is not related to}} a defect in colonization of host cultivar as each strain colonizes effectively both rice cultivars, either at the rhizoplane (for 4 B and B 510) and inside the roots (for B 510). The metabolic profiling approach showed that, in response to PGPR inoculation, profiles of rice secondary metabolites were modified, with phenolic compounds such as flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic derivatives being the main metabolites affected. Moreover, plant metabolic changes differed according to Azospirillum strain _ cultivar combinations; indeed, 4 B induced major secondary metabolic profile modifications only on Cigalon roots, while B 510, probably due to its endophytic feature, induced metabolic variations on shoots and roots of both cultivars, triggering a systemic response. Plant secondary metabolite profiling thereby evidences the specific interaction between an Azospirillum strain and its original host cultivar. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

Indeed, several studies have demonstrated that exogenous applications of SA (Bari and Jones 2009) and JA (Agrawal et al. 2000; Lorenzo and Solano 2005; Wasternack 2007; Bari and Jones 2009) induce PR genes and consequently increase the resistance to several pathogens. In addition, exogenous applications of JA also increase the activities of CAT and SOD enzymes in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] plants stressed by cadmium (Noriega et al. 2012). The ISR might be related also to the reported effects of A. brasilense against soil-borne plant pathogens such as Rhizoctonia spp. (Russo et al. 2008) and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. matthiolae (Somers et al. 2005).|$|R

Strain B 510 is an endophytic bacterium isolated from stems of rice plants (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare). The genome of B 510 consisted of a single chromosome (3 311 395 bp) and six plasmids, designated as pAB 510 a (1 455 109 bp), pAB 510 b (723 779 bp), pAB 510 c (681 723 bp), pAB 510 d (628 837 bp), pAB 510 e (537 299 bp), and pAB 510 f (261 596 bp). The chromosome bears 2893 potential protein-encoding genes, two sets of rRNA gene clusters (rrns), and 45 tRNA genes representing 37 tRNA species. The genomes of the six plasmids contained a total of 3416 protein-encoding genes, seven sets of rrns, and 34 tRNAs representing 19 tRNA species. Eight genes for plasmid-specific tRNA species are located on either pAB 510 a or pAB 510 d. Two out of eight genomic islands are inserted in the plasmids, pAB 510 b and pAB 510 e, {{and one of the}} islands is inserted into trnfM-CAU in the rrn located on pAB 510 e.

30|$|Another defense {{mechanism}} of the plants is mediated by ISR (induced systemic resistance), resulting in plant resistance to some pathogenic bacteria, viruses and fungi (Lugtenberg and Kamilova 2009). ISR is triggered by non-pathogenic microorganisms and starts in primary infected parts, extending to other plant tissues (Dutta et al. 2008). Biochemical or physiological changes in plants include induced accumulation of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins that have different functions like the proteins encoded by PR 1 (a member of a multigene family) (Morris et al. 1998), PR- 2 (a β- 1 - 3 -glucanase) (Kauffmann et al. 1987), PR 4 (a chitinase family) (Nasser et al. 1988). Transcriptome studies of PR genes with <b>Azospirillum</b> sp. <b>B</b> 510 applied as inoculum to rice (O. sativa L.) reported that one gene was up- and five were down-regulated (Drogue et al. 2014). In another study with Arabidopsis thaliana inoculated with A. brasilense Sp 245, PR genes were also up-regulated (Spaepen et al. 2014). In our study, seed inoculation resulted in significant up-regulation of only one PR gene in roots, PR 1, while foliar application in general resulted in up-regulation of PR 1, prp 2 and prp 4 genes on roots. Up-regulation of PR 1 and prp 4 was also verified with metabolite spray. In relation to the gene expression in leaves, emphasis {{should be given to}} single-seed inoculation with both strains that up-regulated all PR genes. Interestingly, {{it has been shown that}} the use of more than one microorganism optimized ISR responses in pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) (Dutta et al. 2008), similarly to our results with seed inoculation of Ab-V 5  + Ab-V 6 on roots. Bacillus subtilis also up-regulated PR 1 and PR 4, but not SOD 2 genes in maize roots (Gond et al. 2015). It is also worth mentioning that ISR responses in different tissues from those where the microorganism is applied occurs, e.g. leaf spray with Pseudomonas fluorescens in rice induced ISR against the soil-borne plant pathogen Rhizoctonia solani (Vidhyasekaran and Muthamilan 1999).|$|R

Plants are able to sense and to respond accordingly to ecologically distinct bacteria, by inducing defense pathways against pathogens to prevent parasitic interactions, and by stimulating the growth of root-associated beneficial or commensal bacteria through root exudation. Plant secondary metabolism is expected {{to play a major role}} in this control. However, secondary metabolite responses of a same plant to cooperative, commensal and deleterious bacteria have so far never been compared. The impact of the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) <b>Azospirillum</b> lipoferum 4 <b>B</b> on the secondary metabolite profiles of two Oryza sativa L. cultivars (Cigalon and Nipponbare) was compared to that of a rice pathogen Burkholderia glumae AU 6208, the causing agent of bacterial panicle blight and of a commensal environmental bacteria Escherichia coli B 6. Root and shoot rice extracts were analyzed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Principal component analyses (PCAs) pinpointed discriminant secondary metabolites, which were characterized by mass spectrometry. Direct comparison of metabolic profiles evidenced that each bacterial ecological interaction induced distinct qualitative and quantitative modifications of rice secondary metabolism, by altering the content of numerous flavonoid compounds and hydroxycinnamic acid (HCA) derivatives. Secondary metabolism varied according to the cultivars and the interaction types, demonstrating the relevance of secondary metabolic profiling for studying plant–bacteria biotic interactions...|$|R
40|$|Application of biofertilizers, {{especially}} {{plant growth}} promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and mycorrhiza fungus {{is one of}} the most important strategies for plant nutrition compared to chemical fertilizers, especially in sustainable management of agroecosystems. In order to investigate the effect of Azotobacter and Azospirillum bacteria and Mycorrhiza fungus on the growth indices of black cumin (Nigella sativa L.), a field experiment was conducted at the Agricultural Research Station of Ferdowsi University of Mashhad during growing season of 2007. A randomized complete block design with three replications was used. Treatments included: (A) Azotobacter paspali, (<b>B)</b> <b>Azospirillum</b> brasilense, (C) the fungus of Glomus intraradaices, C+A, C+B, A+B, A+B+C, and control without using bio-fertilizers. The Azotobacter and Azospirillum inoculations were applied as liquid and the Mycorrhiza inoculation was applied in solid form on the treated seeds with Arabic resin immediately before planting. The Arabic resin was applied to increase the adherence of Mycorrhiza to seeds. In all treatments except control, the amounts of 15 mg of each bio-fertilizer were applied for 110 g of seeds. The results indicated that the inoculation of black cumin with biological fertilizers significantly increased plant height, leaf area index, dry matter accumulation and crop growth rate compared with control. The maximum plant height was observed in Azospirillum+Mycorrhiza at 89 days after emerging. The highest and lowest leaf area index was observed in B+C (0. 37) and control (0. 22) treatments, respectively. The fast period of vegetative growth and dry matter accumulation were observed at 40 - 89 days after emerging with a small decline afterwards until physiological maturity. The maximum and minimum amounts of dry matter accumulation were recorded in the B+C treatment with 66. 0 gm- 2, and control with 38. 3 gm- 2, respectively. Crop growth rate reached to its peak in 82 days after emergence followed by a decreasing trend afterwards, its highest and lowest were observed in the B+C treatment with 14. 5 gm- 2 d- 1 and control with 5. 8 gm- 2 d- 1, respectively. Also, net assimilation rate reached to its peak in 61 days after emerging followed by a decreasing trend afterwards until the end of growth and its maximum and minimum were recorded in B+C treatment (47. 2 gm- 2 d- 1) and control (39. 7 gm- 2 d- 1), respectively. Further, investigations on quantity and quality of medicinal plants including black cumin in association with biological fertilizers effects will provide additional information.
