50|$|Mechanical {{ignition}} systems use {{a mechanical}} spark distributor to distribute a high voltage current {{to the correct}} spark plug at the correct time. In order to set an initial <b>timing</b> <b>advance</b> or <b>timing</b> retard for an engine, the engine is allowed to idle and the distributor is adjusted to achieve the best ignition timing for the engine at idle speed.

40|$|Biodiesel is an {{environmentally}} friendly alternative diesel fuel {{consisting of the}} alkyl monoesters of fatty acids. It is obtained from triglycerides through the transesterfication process. The objective {{of this research was}} to determine the reason for the higher levels of NOx emissions that have been observed from biodiesel fueled engines. A concept map was developed to show the interrelationships between the fuel and engine variables that affect NOx production. It was determined that a change in combustion timing caused by changes in fuel properties between diesel fuel and biodiesel might be the source of the NOx increase. Tests were conducted to determine the effect of blending biodiesel with diesel fuel on these properties, and to determine the effect of biodiesel fuel properties such as the lower heating value, density, speed of sound, bulk modulus, cetane number, and volatility on the NOx emissions from a diesel engine fueled with biodiesel.;It was found that biodiesel is more dense and less compressible than No. 1 and No. 2 diesel fuels and that the chain length and saturation increase the density, speed of sound, and isentropic bulk modulus. It was also found that the higher oxides of nitrogen emission could be explained by a start of combustion advance. Half of the start of combustion advance originated from a start of injection advance of which about half is due to the <b>automatic</b> <b>timing</b> <b>advance</b> of the pump as it injects more fuel to compensate for the lower heating value of biodiesel and half is due to the bulk modulus, viscosity, and density of the fuel, which show significant differences from pump to pump. The other half of the start of combustion <b>timing</b> <b>advance</b> was due to the higher cetane number of the biodiesel. The higher cetane number in the soybean biodiesel advances the start of combustion and therefore contributes to the increase of the NOx. However, the cetane number of the yellow grease biodiesel was so high that it suppressed the premixed portion of the combustion and lowered the brake specific oxides of nitrogen emission relative to soybean oil biodiesel...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{develops}} a joint timing synchronization and channel estimation algorithm suitable for downlink MIMO networks {{based on a}} time-domain training sequence arrangement in the short-range wireless transmission environment. Unlike the previous works [9 – 13, 17, 18], this paper not only introduces the use of sliding observation vector in timing synchronization phase but also applies the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) criterion to perform fine time adjustment. In this paper, we first obtain a coarse timing offset using the cross-correlation function outputs based on the proposed training sequences at each receive antenna and then apply the generalized maximum-likelihood (ML) algorithm to find the <b>advanced</b> <b>timing,</b> relative timing indices, and the corresponding CIR estimates. The reason why we use the <b>advanced</b> <b>timing</b> instead of coarse timing offset to perform fine time adjustment {{is that we can}} have better timing synchronization performance at very low SNR. Finally, the designed metric based on the MMSE criterion is utilized to perform fine time adjustment. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. This paper is an extended version of [19]. This paper addresses synchronization and channel estimation aspects of a multiple transmit antenna system, whereas [19] only considered those of a single transmit antenna system.|$|R

50|$|The second {{method used}} to advance (or retard) the {{ignition}} timing is called vacuum <b>timing</b> <b>advance.</b> This method {{is almost always}} used in addition to mechanical <b>timing</b> <b>advance.</b> It generally increases fuel economy and driveability, particularly at lean mixtures. It also increases engine life through more complete combustion, leaving less unburned fuel to wash away the cylinder wall lubrication (piston ring wear), and less lubricating oil dilution (bearings, camshaft life, etc.). Vacuum advance works by using a manifold vacuum source to <b>advance</b> the <b>timing</b> at low to mid engine load conditions by rotating the position sensor (contact points, hall effect or optical sensor, reluctor stator, etc.) mounting plate in the distributor {{with respect to the}} distributor shaft. Vacuum advance is diminished at wide open throttle (WOT), causing the <b>timing</b> <b>advance</b> to return to the base advance in addition to the mechanical advance.|$|R

In addition, a generalized maximum-likelihood (ML) channel estimation scheme is presented, and this one-shot scheme is applied to obtain all channel impulse responses (CIR) from different transmit antennas. The proposed approach consists of three stages at each receive antenna. First, coarse timing and frequency offset estimates are obtained. Then, an <b>advanced</b> <b>timing,</b> relative timing indices, and the corresponding CIR estimates at the second stage are obtained using the generalized ML estimation based on a sliding observation vector. Finally, the fine time adjustment based on the minimum mean squared error criterion is performed.

50|$|The {{contact breaker}} is {{operated}} by an engine-driven cam, {{and the position}} of the contact breaker is set so that it opens (and hence generates a spark) at exactly the correct moment needed to ignite the fuel {{at the top of the}} piston's compression stroke.

The plate is rotated by a centrifugal mechanism, thus <b>advancing</b> the ignition <b>timing</b> (making the spark occur earlier) at higher revolutions.

Aims To quantify the impact of shifts in timing {{of breeding}} on changes in Willow Warbler productivity across the UK. Methods Using records of ∼ 7000 nests from the British Trust for Ornithology Nest Record Scheme, we quantify shifts in timing of breeding and seasonal variation in productivity and timing of breeding, and explore their relative contribution to changes in overall productivity. As population trajectories vary across Britain (south-east declining, north-west stable), analyses were conducted regionally. Results In both regions, nesting dates have advanced and early-season productivity is highest. However, while the proportion of early-season nests has increased, the seasonal decline in productivity in the north-west has lessened, and overall (season-long) productivity is stable. In the south-east, however, the seasonal decline in productivity has strengthened and, despite the <b>advance</b> in <b>timing</b> of breeding, overall productivity has declined.
