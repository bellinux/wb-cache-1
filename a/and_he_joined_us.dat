40|$|I am {{compelled}} {{to write this}} commentary after reading the paper by Jade et al. 13; 1. Although the authors have been gracious enough to acknowledge us, I consider this 13; paper a violation of scientific ethics. Let me briefly sketch the background. The data and the survey points used in their paper form part of a project that I conceived and commenced independently in 2001. Since {{we did not have}} any GPS receivers, we used to get them on loan from various organizations, and in 2003, we took them from CMMACS, 13; Bangalore. Sreedevi Jade (scientist at C-MMACS and the senior author of the paper in question) suggested that Souvik Banerjee who was working in CMMACS as project assistant would accompany us to help handle their receivers and also to occupy two points at Port Blair (CARI campus) and Havelock (HAVE), previously established by 13; C-MMACS. Banerjee, however, made it clear to me that his interest was mainly in locating and occupying the two points established previously by scientists from 13; C-MMACS, other than being a field help to us. However, these survey points (known as 13; CARI and HAVE) could not be located, as they were probably destroyed by construction 13; activities. Nonetheless, we invited Banerjee to join us with our work <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> in setting up two stations, those at DGLP (Diglipur) and Chatham (CHAT). In addition, we had also shown him our station at Havelok, set up by us in 2002 (note that this is different from HAVE, the C-MMACS point, which was not traceable). During the same season, we set up additional stations at Car Nicobar and Campbell Bay, but Banerjee chose not to 13; accompany us to these sites. After completing the work in that season, we returned the receivers and the data were downloaded to the computer at C-MMACS. Subsequently, Banerjee left C-MMACS, and Jade did not show any interest in this work (although I suggested a collaborative study, initially), nor did she evince any interest in future work in these sites. In fact, when I requested to loan the equipment in September 2004, Jade discouraged me from conducting the survey at that time and did not lend us the units. Since I thought it was important to continue the work, I borrowed them from elsewhere and continued our work. The 2004 earthquake suddenly kindled their interest and computing the coseismic displacement became an important issue. At this time, the CMMACS group went ahead and reoccupied our control points, clandestinely. 13; They never communicated with us nor cared to request our permission, either about using the data collected in 2003 or about reoccupying the bases established and maintained by us. The basis of the paper in question are the data from 2003 and that collected after the earthquake, by reoccupying some of the stations, set up independently by my student and me. None from C-MMACS (including Banerjee) ever visited Car Nicobar before the earthquake to set up any GPS control points that have now provided the crucial data; it was set up by my student and myself, {{spending a lot of time}} and money, in tough field conditions. However, since the coordinates and data were available in C-MMACS, their personnel could trace all our stations and reoccupy them...|$|E

5000|$|A {{childhood}} {{acquaintance of}} Timofeev and Ryzhov, Oleg Zhukov, was amongst {{the biggest and}} most loyal fans of [...] "Disco 'Crash'", and soon joined the duo's closest circle of friends. One night, they took him with them to a soirée organized by a company called [...] "Kranek", and all Zhukov did was repeating the company's name during one song.

This happened in 1991. Around that time, the band was invited to Moscow for a trial studio record, resulting in their first album [...] "Танцуй со мной" [...] (Tantsuy so mnoy", Dance with me), but it wasn't what the band expected. Some of its songs were later reused in their first official album.Towards 1997, the trio noticed their club was losing their popularity. They found out that a rival disco opened in town, and people there were charged half as much. They discovered that disco had only one MC, young and motivated, close in style to Timofeev. They decided that it was the best to join forces with him. That's how Alexey Serov joined the band. His first contribution to the band was recording a skit where he asked to turn the music off using lots of expletives (used later in the song [...] "Заколебал Ты!"

(Gratzer would, after retirement, join forces with Joe Clark at Aviation Partners Inc., developing their blended winglets.) While at Boeing, Raisbeck and a team of engineers and flight crew designed and flight-tested an internally blown trailing edge flap system on the prototype 707, 367-80, known as the Dash 80. The Dash 80 first flew in December 1963, and soon demonstrated flight at speeds as slow as 60 knots, at gross weights exceeding 150,000 lbs.

We ran races on our ponies, and when there were race-meetings in our neighbourhood my father would give us a little money to go and enter our ponies in a boys' race. We rarely won when there were any stakes, as the native boys were too clever on horseback for us, and had all sorts of tricks to prevent us from winning, even when our ponies were better than theirs. We also went tinamou, or partridge, catching, and sometimes we had sham fights with lances, or long canes with which we supplied the others. These games were very rough, and one day when we were armed, not with canes but long straight pliant green poplar boughs we had cut for the purpose, we were having a running fight, when one of the boys got in a rage with me for some reason and, dropping behind, then coming quietly up, gave me a blow on the face and head with his stick which sent me flying off my pony. They all dashed on, leaving me there to pick myself up, and mounting my pony I went home crying with pain and rage. The blow had fallen on my head, but the pliant stick had come down over my face from the forehead to the chin, taking the skin off. On my way back I met our shepherd and told him my story, and said I would go to the boy's parents to tell them. He advised me not to do so; he said I must learn to take my own part, and if any one injured me and I wanted him punished I must do the punishing myself. If I made any fuss and complaint about it I should only get laughed at, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> would go scot free. What, then, was I to do?
