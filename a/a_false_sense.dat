5|$|The Germans, too, had {{suffered}} heavy casualties; the 116th Panzer Division, for example, {{had lost its}} offensive capabilities after countless attempts to break the U.S. First Army's encirclement of Aachen. This gave American and British commanders <b>a</b> <b>false</b> <b>sense</b> of security, believing that the Wehrmacht {{did not have the}} strength to launch a counteroffensive. Given their view {{on the state of the}} German armed forces and their need to push to the Rur, the First Army decided to drive German forces out of the Hürtgen Forest—located on the Belgian–German border—in an attempt to take a series of dams which could be used by the Germans to flood the valley below.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team erected two posts {{on the summit}} plateau to assist walkers {{attempting}} the descent in foggy conditions. These posts were subsequently cut down by climbers, sparking controversy in mountaineering circles on the ethics of such additions. Critics argued that cairns and posts are an unnecessary man-made intrusion into the natural landscape, which create <b>a</b> <b>false</b> <b>sense</b> of security and could lessen mountaineers' sense of {{responsibility for their own}} safety. Supporters of navigational aids pointed to the high number of accidents that occurred on the mountain (between 1990 and 1995 alone there were 13 fatalities, although eight of these were due to falls while rock climbing rather than navigational error), the long tradition of placing such aids on the summit, and the potentially life-saving role they could play.

In this transference, the strivings of the grandiose self are mobilized and the patient attempts to use the therapist to gratify these strivings.|$|R
5|$|The emperor's {{blessing of}} Palmyrene {{authority}} has been debated; Aurelian's acceptance of Palmyrene rule in Egypt may {{be inferred from}} the Oxyrhynchus papyri, which are dated by the regnal years of the emperor and Vaballathus. No proof of a formal agreement exists, and the evidence is {{based solely on the}} joint coinage- and papyri-dating. It is unlikely that Aurelian would have accepted such power-sharing, but he was unable to act in 271 due to crises in the West. His apparent condoning of Zenobia's actions may have been a ruse to give her <b>a</b> <b>false</b> <b>sense</b> of security while he prepared for war. Another reason for Aurelian's tolerance may have been his desire to ensure a constant supply of Egyptian grain to Rome; it is not recorded that the supply was cut, and the ships sailed to Rome in 270 as usual. Some modern scholars, such as , suggest that Cladius Gothicus had concluded a formal agreement with Zenobia which Aurelian ignored.|$|E
5|$|Warshaw {{and other}} Atari {{executives}} presented this design to Spielberg, {{who did not}} express enthusiasm. Spielberg instead asked him to create a game similar to Namco's Pac-Man. Believing the concept too derivative of a common game design, Warshaw proceeded with his concept, which he believed would capture the sentimentality {{he saw in the}} original film. In retrospect, however, Warshaw stated that Spielberg's idea might have had merit. He spent the remaining time programming the game. Atari anticipated enormous sales based on the popularity of the film, as well as the stability the video game industry was experiencing in 1982. Due to time limitations, Atari decided to skip audience testing for the game. Emanual Gerard, co-chief operating officer of Warner at the time, later suggested that the company had fallen into <b>a</b> <b>false</b> <b>sense</b> of security by the success of its previous releases, particularly its console version of Pac-Man, which was commercially successful despite poor critical reaction.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the cold winter were {{exacerbated}} by problems in the energy sector which caused coal supplies to become low. The coal and electricity industries had been recently nationalised by Clement Attlee's government and placed {{under the control of}} the Minister of Fuel and Power, Manny Shinwell. Shinwell oversaw efforts to increase production, but there were concerns that the coal supply was inadequate. At the start of the winter the coal stockpiles contained enough coal to last for just four weeks, compared to the usual supplies of ten to twelve weeks which existed before the war. However, Shinwell allowed himself to be lulled into <b>a</b> <b>false</b> <b>sense</b> of security by over-optimistic productivity reports from the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). These reports failed to translate into real production as the government feared to take on the NUM, whose members' absentee rates were 2.5 times those of the pre-war period. The risk of a coal shortage caused the public to buy electric fires to ensure a source of heat for their homes. This, in turn, put a greater strain on the supply of electricity– the monthly demand increase caused by electric fires in 1946 was roughly the same as the annual increase in generating capacity. Shinwell was warned in mid-October that a coal shortage was possible, but gambled on a mild winter to keep consumption low so that he would not have to risk a confrontation with the miners.|$|E
50|$|Social {{sciences}} or philosophies {{are sometimes}} accused {{of taking the}} 'moral high ground' because they are often inherently interested in the project of human freedom and justice.

40|$|One of {{the most}} crucial {{functionalities}} of cognitive radio networks is spectrum sensing. Completing this task in an accurate manner requires opportunistic spectrum access. Traditionally, sensing has been performed through energy detection by each individual secondary user. In order to increase accuracy, individual measurements are aggregated using different fusion functions. However, even though collaborative spectrum sensing can increase accuracy under benign settings, it is prone to falsification attacks, where malicious secondary users report fake sensings. Previous studies have designed trust (reputation) based systems to contain {{the effect of the}} adversaries, ignoring to a large extent the wireless channel irregularities when performing the computation. In this paper, we decouple the reasons behind <b>a</b> <b>false</b> <b>sensing</b> report and propose the Decoupling Trust and Capability Spectrum Sensing System (DTCS 3). DTCS 3 is a collaborative spectrum sensing system that takes into account both a secondary sensor node’s trust and its capability to sense the channel. Through thorough evaluations that consider a large variety of attack strategies, we show that by accounting for wireless induced effects while calculating the reporting trust of a secondary user, we can significantly improve the performance of a collaborative spectrum sensing system as compared to existing schemes in the literature. In particular, the true positive/negative rates can be improved by as much as 36 %, while DTCS 3 is able to track and respond to dynamic changes in the adversaries behavior...|$|R

While she is recovering at the hospital, an alive Victor arrives. A surprised Téa, Dani, and Jack welcome Victor back, while Todd tries to bond with his children. Todd remains concerned about Jack and Dani, attempting to buy their affections with money and deciding {{the best way to}} win them over is to call a truce with Victor. He also tries to win back Blair's affections. He eventually admits he only pretended to get along with Victor to lure him into <b>a</b> <b>false</b> <b>sense</b> of security. Victor admits that he poisoned Todd's scotch with arsenic and then tried to strangle him. Jack takes Todd to the hospital, where he recovers but is frustrated when his family continues to defend Victor. Victor realizes he must leave town and says goodbye to his family. Todd shows Blair a threatening note he received with the names of all his loved ones on it. The mysterious Tattoo Organization that held Victor demands that Todd find and kill Victor. Todd, Blair and Téa devise a scheme to fool this organization into believing Victor is dead. Feeling secure that their scheme has worked, they plan for a future. Todd receives another note by the Tattoo Organization, this time telling him that he failed them and that Victor has been recaptured. Todd is told that he must leave Llanview and go to the address given on the note. Todd and Blair are devastated. Todd says goodbye to Viki and his children, but does not tell them the real reason he is leaving is to protect their family. Before Todd leaves, he and Blair make love one last time, and it is revealed that they have remarried.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been {{widespread}} growth of shopping and buying on mobile devices, termed mCommerce. With this comes a {{need to understand how}} to best design experiences for mobile shopping. To help address this, we conducted a diary and interview study with mCommerce shoppers who have already adopted the technology and shop on their mobile devices regularly. Our study explores typical mCommerce routines and behaviours along with issues of soft trust, given its long-term concern for eCommerce. Our results describe spontaneous purchasing and routine shopping behaviours where people gravitate to their mobile device even if a computer is nearby. We found that participants faced few trust issues because they had limited access to unknown companies. In addition, app marketplaces and recommendations from friends offered a form of brand protection. These findings suggest that companies can decrease trust issues by tying mCommerce designs to friend networks and known marketplaces. The caveat for shoppers, however, is that they can be easily lured into <b>a</b> potentially <b>false</b> <b>sense</b> of trust. Author Keywords Mobile; commerce; trust; shoppin...|$|R

40|$|Just {{as it was}} {{beginning}} to look like we were winning the remediation battle at groundwater contamination sites, the impact of MTBE releases reared its ugly head. In the midst of our remediation battle and our MTBE discoveries, we have seen the blossoming of a management strategy for contaminated groundwater known as monitored natural attenuation, or MNA. MNA refers to the reliance on natural attenuation (see definition below) processes {{within the context of a}} controlled and monitored site cleanup Hmm. approach to achieve remedial objectives. A close examination of the application of MNA, however, reveals some potential problem areas involving the misidentification of processes that govern contaminant plume behavior.
