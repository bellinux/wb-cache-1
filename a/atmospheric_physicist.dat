Beyond Klass and Condon, McDonald butted heads with many other prominent figures, including Donald H. Menzel of Harvard University.

In addition the CCSP ignores all the other man made localized effects as I discussed in a prior comment and other commenters have addressed like insufficient adjustment for urbanization, land use changes and siting issues which are more important than greenhouse gases. The CCSP dismisses any natural factors that are present.

40|$|The global methane (CH₄) {{budget is}} {{becoming}} an increasingly important component for managing realistic pathways to mitigate climate change. This relevance, due to a shorter atmospheric lifetime and a stronger warming potential than carbon dioxide, is challenged by the still unexplained changes of atmospheric CH₄ over the past decade. Emissions and concentrations of CH₄ are continuing to increase, making CH₄ {{the second most important}} human-induced greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. Two major difficulties in reducing uncertainties come from the large variety of diffusive CH₄ sources that overlap geographically, and from the destruction of CH₄ by the very short-lived hydroxyl radical (OH). To address these difficulties, we have established a consortium of multi-disciplinary scientists under the umbrella of the Global Carbon Project to synthesize and stimulate research on the methane cycle, and producing regular (biennial) updates of the global methane budget.

40|$|Numerous {{fields of}} {{atmospheric}} and hydrological sciences require the parametric {{form of the}} raindrop size distribution (DSD) to estimate the rainfall rate from radar observables {{as well as in}} cloud resolving and weather forecasting models. This study aims to investigate the capability of the Johnson SB distribution (JSB) in estimating rain integral parameters. Specifically, rainfall rate (R), reflectivity factor (Z) and mean mass diameter (Dmass) estimated by JSB are compared with those estimated by a three-parameter Gamma distribution, widely used by radar meteorologists and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>physicists</b> to model natural DSD. A large dataset consisting of more than 155, 000 one-minute DSD, from six field campaigns of Ground Validation (GV) program of NASA/JAXA Global Precipitation Measurement mission (GPM), is used to test the performance of both JSB and Gamma distribution. The available datasets cover a wide range of rain regimes because of the field campaigns were carried out in different seasons and locations. Correlation coefficient, bias, root mean square error (RMSE) and fractional standard error (FSE) between estimated and measured integral parameters are calculated to compare the performances of the two distributions. The capability of JSB in estimating the integral parameters, especially R and Z, resulted very close to that of Gamma distribution. In particular, for light precipitation, JSB is superior to Gamma distribution in estimating R with FSE of 11 % with respect to values ranging between 25 % and 37 % about for Gamma. Comparison of the estimated and measured DSDs shows that the JSB distribution reproduces the natural DSD quite accurately...|$|R

These outputs appear, for instance, {{at the top of}} the list of global change forcing agents in the recent FY- 90 document on the U. S. Global Change Program. Significant advances have been made over the past decade in radiometry of the total solar irradiance. Photometry of light variations in stars similar to the sun, but much younger, is providing new insights into the sun's variations in luminosity and UV radiation at previous epochs of interest to paleoclimate studies. Measurement of the sun's 11 -year output variability in the ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet still possess a challenge of great importance. All of these topics are addressed by the program on Radiative Inputs of the Sun to Earth (RISE).

40|$|A {{variety of}} laser {{applications}} in space, past, present, future and far future are reviewed {{together with the}} contributions {{of some of the}} scientists and engineers involved, especially those that happen to have South African connections. Historically, two of the earliest laser applications in space, were atmospheric LIDAR and lunar ranging. These applications involved <b>atmospheric</b> <b>physicists,</b> several astronauts and many of the staff recruited into the Soviet and North American lunar exploration programmes. There is a strong interest in South Africa in both LIDAR and lunar ranging. Shortly after the birth of the laser (and even just prior) theoretical work on photonic propulsion and space propulsion by laser ablation was initiated by Georgii Marx, Arthur Kantrowitz and Eugen Saenger. Present or near future experimental programs are developing in the following fields: laser ablation propulsion, possibly coupled with rail gun or gas gun propulsion; interplanetary laser transmission; laser altimetry; gravity wave detection by space based Michelson interferometry; the de-orbiting of space debris by high power lasers; atom laser interferometry in space. Far future applications of laser-photonic space-propulsion were also pioneered by Carl Sagan and Robert Forward. They envisaged means of putting Saenger’s ideas into practice. Forward also invented a laser based method for manufacturing solid anti-matter or SANTIM, well before the ongoing experiments at CERN with anti-hydrogen production and laser-trapping. SANTIM would be an ideal propellant for interstellar missions if it could be manufactured in sufficient quantities. It would be equally useful as a power source for the transmission of information over light year distances. We briefly mention military lasers.

40|$|Neutral atomic oxygen (AO) -the {{dominant}} atmospheric {{species at}} typical low Earth orbit altitudes-is {{responsible for the}} erosion, or other degradation, of many satellite materials. Therefore, AO has become an important consideration for spacecraft designers and manufacturers. The study of AO is also of interest to <b>atmospheric</b> <b>physicists</b> because it is involved {{in many of the}} chemical reactions occurring naturally in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Both these groups rely on atmospheric models for computer-based simulation and prediction of atomic oxygen concentrations. Such models require, or are enhanced by, empirical input data-that is, actual measurements of AO number densities. A review is presented of the different measurement techniques that, to date, have been used on satellites and sounding rockets to perform AO studies. Rather than reporting results from every sensor application, this article takes a more general view of the experimental methods, using example devices to highlight their advantages and disadvantages. New or promising equipment, or techniques that could be exploited for performing such measurements, are also described. We attempt some semiquantitative comparison of the techniques, although the most appropriate experimental method for any given flight opportunity depends heavily on the mission conditions and science goals. Our emphasis is on missions where the available mass and power are limited. In these situations the most suitable established device is probably that of the thin film actinometer. If more risk can be assumed then a more promising, but as yet unqualified, method is that of the fiber-optic reflectance sensor. However, since both these devices are nonreusable, it is shown that semiconducting sensors may be better for long duration, mass- and power-limited applications...|$|R

The objective of BOREAS is to improve {{our understanding of the}} interaction between the earth’s climate system and the boreal forest at short and intermediate time scales, in order to clarify their role in global change. During the winter, spring and summer of 1994, five field campaigns were conducted. About 85 investigation teams including nearly 300 scientists participated, including forest ecologists and ecophysiologists, <b>atmospheric</b> <b>physicists,</b> boundary-layer meteorologists, hydrologists, biochemists, atmospheric chemists and remote sensing specialists. Data from the field campaigns is being placed into a central archive at the Goddard Space Flight Center for immediate access by all participating scientists, and eventually by the outside scientific community. Analysis of the data began in mid-summer as the data were being collected and continues at a rapid pace. The findings so far have been significant in terms of their implications for global change. The boreal ecosystem, occupying roughly 17 percent of the vegetated land surface and thus an important driver of global weather and climate, absorbs much more solar energy than is assumed by operational numerical weather prediction models. Albedo measurements in BOREAS shows that this forest absorbs nearly 91 percent of the sun’s incident energy. Additionally, while it is known that much of the boreal ecosystem consists of forested wetlands, numerous lakes, bogs and fens, tower and aircraft measurements during 1994 show that the atmosphere above was extremely dry; humidity and deep boundary layer convection (3000 m) mimicked conditions found only over deserts. Physiological measurements of the trees during BOREAS show that this atmospheric desiccation was a result of the forest’s strong biological control limiting surface evaporation. The data further show this tight control was linked to the low soil temperatures and subsequently reduced rates of photosynthesis. BOREAS measurements also focused on net ecosystem carbon exchange. Data acquired during the late spring and summer, showed the boreal forest to be a net carbon sink. However, no measurements were taken in the early spring following thaw, and in the late fall, where the balance between photosynthesis and respiration is poorly understood. During 1996 additional data will be acquired to resolve the annual carbon budget and how it might depend on interannual climate differences. Part I Climate Chang...|$|R
