2500|$|In October 1841, two Augustinian friars from Saint Augustine's Church in Philadelphia {{purchased}} the [...] "Belle Air" [...] estate in Radnor Township {{with the intention}} of starting a school. The school, which was called the [...] "Augustinian College of Vilanova", opened in 1842. However, the Philadelphia Nativist Riots of 1844 that burned Saint Augustine's Church in Philadelphia caused financial difficulties for the Augustinians, and the college was closed in February 1845. The college reopened in 1846 and graduated its first class in 1847. In March 1848, the governor of Pennsylvania incorporated the school and gave it the power to grant degrees. [...] In 1859, the first master's degree was conferred on a student. In 1857, the school closed again as the demand for priests in Philadelphia prevented <b>adequate</b> <b>staffing,</b> and the crisis of the Panic of 1857 strained the school financially. The school remained closed throughout the Civil War and reopened in September 1865; since then it has operated continuously.
