5|$|The Griffins, the Swansons, and Quagmire {{prepare for}} a road trip, ostensibly for a {{vacation}} in Maine. Quagmire distracts Bonnie and Lois as Peter alters course to Virginia instead. The group arrives at a bar in Stoolbend, Virginia, and discover that it was Cleveland who told the bartender the joke. Peter asks Cleveland where he first heard the joke, and Cleveland reveals that a Washington, D.C., bellhop named Sal Russo told it to him. The group sets out for D.C. with Cleveland in tow. They are attacked by a black car, whose occupants fire guns at them {{to prevent them from}} learning the joke's origin. Joe shoots out one of the car's tires, causing it to spin out of control and flip onto its roof. The Quahog group arrive <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Washington</b> hotel and locate Sal, who is reluctant to reveal the source of the joke. He races away on a handcart through Washington. Losing track of Sal, they are soon captured by several men in black suits who pistol-whip them until they are unconscious.|$|E

25|$|In 1983 President Ronald Reagan awarded Helms the National Security Medal, {{given to}} both civilians and the military. That year Helms {{also served as}} a member of the President's Commission on National Security. After Reagan's {{election}} in 1980, Helms had evidently been a behind-the-scenes proponent of William Casey for the DCI position. Helms and Casey (DCI 1981â€“87) first met while serving in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) during the second world war. Also in 1983 Helms gave a prepared speech on intelligence issues, before dignitaries and five hundred invited guests gathered <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Washington</b> awards banquet held in his honor.

500|$|Four months later, FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) meet <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Washington</b> bar {{to discuss}} the Budahas case.

Mulder claims that six other pilots are missing at the base, which is subject to rumors about experimental aircraft. While using the bar's restroom, Mulder is approached by a mysterious informant named [...] "Deep Throat" [...] (Jerry Hardin), who cautions him to avoid the case. He claims that Mulder is under surveillance, which later proves to be true.|$|E
500|$|Affleck {{appeared}} {{at a press}} conference with New York Senator Chuck Schumer in 2002, in support of a proposed Anti-Nuclear Terrorism Prevention Act. In 2003, he criticised the [...] "questionable and aggressive" [...] use of the Patriot Act and the resulting [...] "encroachments on civil liberties". A reporter for The Washington Post overheard Affleck denouncing the Israeli invasion of Gaza <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Washington</b> party in 2009. Steven Clemons, a participant in the conversation, said Affleck listened [...] "to alternative takes ... What Affleck spoke about that night was reasoned, complex and made a lot of sense." [...] Later that year, in a New York Times interview, Affleck remarked that his views were closer to those of the Israeli Labor Party than Likud.|$|E
500|$|GCC members {{questioned}} {{the efficacy of}} climate change denial and shifted their message to highlighting the economic costs of proposed greenhouse gas emission regulations and the limited effectiveness of proposals exempting developing nations. In 1995, after the United Nations Climate Change conference in Berlin agreed to negotiate greenhouse gas emission limits, GCC's executive director said the agreement gave [...] "developing countries like China, India and Mexico a free ride" [...] and would [...] "change the relations between sovereign countries and the United Nations. This could have very significant implications. It could {{be a way of}} capping our economy." [...] <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. press conference {{on the eve of the}} second United Nations Climate Change conference in Geneva, GCC's executive director said, [...] "The time for decision is not yet now."

500|$|A {{secondary}} {{question of}} the Filegate controversy revolved around what the Office of Personnel Security was, who had authorized the hiring of Livingstone, and whether he was qualified for the job. [...] The Office was not responsible for actual White House security, as that was the charge of the United States Secret Service, nor did it perform background checks on potential White House employees, a task done by the FBI, nor did it keep the regular personnel files of employees, which were held in a different office within the White House. Rather, its role was {{to keep track of}} who was employed by the White House, make sure their security clearances were up to date, and give security briefings to new hires. [...] Nevertheless, Livingstone seemed to lack qualifications for even this position; he had worked on a number of Democratic Party campaigns and transitions, including being an advance man for the Clinton-Gore 1992 campaign, and his only prior job in the [...] "security" [...] field was that of a local bar bouncer <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C., night club. (At the congressional hearings, Livingstone objected to [...] "false and unfair caricatures of who I am. [...] I have worked hard for little or no pay in political campaigns for candidates who I felt would make this country a better place to live." [...] In later years Livingstone would continue to maintain on the internet that he had been qualified for the position, that the First Lady had signed off on hiring him, and that his character had been maligned by the general media). Clinton opponents stated that Livingstone had the highest level of security clearances in the U.S. government. White House officials could not explain why Livingstone was hired, nor who had hired him.|$|E
