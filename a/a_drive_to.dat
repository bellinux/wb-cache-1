5|$|The {{campaign}} that Australian planners developed entailed three separate drives: in the north, it was planned that Japanese forces {{would be forced}} into the narrow Bonis Peninsula and contained; in the centre the seizure of Pearl Ridge would give the Australians control of the east–west avenues of approach, as well as affording them protection against further counter-attacks, while also opening the way for <b>a</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> the east coast; and the main campaign in the south, where {{the bulk of the}} Japanese forces were concentrated around Buin.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} a very small car park (eleven spaces) and is not {{permanently}} staffed, but it contains a ticket machine, one of an initial batch of ten installed by SPT in late 2003 and early 2004 as part of <b>a</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> curb fare dodging, which {{was estimated to be}} costing the company £2 million a year. Both platforms are elevated and each has a wheelchair ramp. There is a connecting footbridge between the two platforms.|$|E

5|$|The synagogue's {{fortunes}} {{improved in}} the 1940s, but in 1946, its bank threatened to foreclose on its buildings, {{in anticipation of}} their sale to the local Catholic diocese, as the congregation had not paid the mortgage in many years. The congregation succeeded in convincing the bank to re-negotiate its mortgage, and reduce the outstanding loan, and Max Koeppel led <b>a</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> pay it off completely.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} other bodies and agencies {{that have not}} had their seats fixed by treaties. Brussels hosts the European Defence Agency (as NATO and formerly the WEU {{are also in the}} city). Luxembourg hosts the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union and the European Investment Bank. Strasbourg hosts the office of the European Ombudsman. The other agencies are spread across Europe and since the 2004 enlargement, there has been <b>a</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> locate more agencies in the new member-states to make a more equal distribution.|$|E
5|$|As part of <b>a</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> beautify the coinage, five {{denominations}} of US coins {{had received}} new designs between 1907 and 1909. In 1911, Taft administration officials decided to replace Charles E. Barber's Liberty Head {{design for the}} nickel, and commissioned Fraser to do the work. They were impressed by Fraser's designs showing a Native American and an American bison. The designs were approved in 1912, but were delayed several months because of objections from the Hobbs Manufacturing Company, which made mechanisms to detect slugs in nickel-operated machines. The company was not satisfied by changes made in the coin by Fraser, and in February 1913, Treasury Secretary Franklin MacVeagh decided to issue the coins despite the objections.|$|E

Of the four national evening soap operas, three are set and filmed in Northern England (Coronation Street in Manchester, Emmerdale in the Yorkshire Dales and Hollyoaks in Chester) and these {{are important to the}} local TV industry – the commitment to Emmerdale saved ITV Yorkshire's Leeds Studios from closure. The region also has a reputation for drama serials and has produced some the most successful and acclaimed series of recent decades, including Boys from the Blackstuff, Our Friends in the North, Clocking Off, Shameless and Last Tango in Halifax.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{bombardment}} of Kagoshima, the Satsuma domain had become {{closer to the}} British and was pursuing the modernization of its army and navy with their support. The Scottish dealer Thomas Blake Glover sold quantities of warships and guns to the southern domains. American and British military experts, usually former officers, may have been directly involved in this military effort. The British ambassador Harry Smith Parkes supported the anti-Shogunate forces in <b>a</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> establish a legitimate, unified Imperial rule in Japan, and to counter French influence with the Shogunate. During that period, southern Japanese leaders such as Saigō Takamori of Satsuma, or Itō Hirobumi and Inoue Kaoru of Chōshū cultivated personal connections with British diplomats, notably Ernest Mason Satow.|$|E
5|$|Experimental mercury vapor {{turbines}} {{were installed}} {{to increase the}} efficiency of fossil-fuel electrical power plants. The South Meadow power plant in Hartford, CT employed mercury as its working fluid, in a binary configuration with a secondary water circuit, {{for a number of years}} starting in the late 1920s in <b>a</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> improve plant efficiency. Several other plants were built, including the Schiller Station in Portsmouth, NH, which went online in 1950. The idea did not catch on industry-wide due to the weight and toxicity of mercury, as well as the advent of supercritical steam plants in later years.|$|E

5|$|Georgia State {{opened the}} second half with <b>a</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> the Alabama 36-yard line {{to set up a}} school record 53-yard field goal by Wil Lutz. Alabama responded with a 68-yard march that ended in a {{touchdown}} pass from Blake Sims to Chris Black for a 45–3 lead. With the score at 45–3, neither team scored again. After a Panthers punt, Alabama's next drive ended with Crimson Tide backup kicker Adam Griffith missing a 30-yard field goal. Before his exit late in the second quarter, McCarron set the Alabama record for passing accuracy at 93.75%, going 15–16 and surpassed the previous record of 84.2% held by Ken Stabler. With the win, Alabama improved its all-time record against Georgia State to 2–0.|$|E
5|$|In 1759, peace {{negotiations}} at The Hague came to nothing. The series of Franco-Austrian losses were reversed until, in 1762, the Empress Elizabeth of Russia died. Her successor Peter III greatly admired Frederick, {{and at once}} withdrew Russia's support from the French coalition. Prussia began <b>a</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> expel the Austrians from Saxony, and the French from Hesse-Kassel. Though she was only partially successful as her own forces were exhausted, the conflict had essentially descended into a costly stalemate, with Maria Theresa no longer believing that she could retake Silesia. The peace treaties of Hubertusburg and Paris exacted harsh terms from France, as {{she was forced to}} relinquish most of her American colonies. For Austria, though, the result was the status quo ante bellum.|$|E
5|$|On 17 August 1563, Charles IX was {{declared}} of {{age at the}} Parlement of Rouen, {{but he was never}} able to rule on his own and showed little interest in government. Catherine decided to launch <b>a</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> enforce the Edict of Amboise and revive loyalty to the crown. To this end, she set out with Charles and the court on a progress around France that lasted from January 1564 until May 1565. Catherine held talks with Jeanne d'Albret, the Protestant queen regnant of Navarre (and the wife of Antoine de Bourbon) at Mâcon and Nérac. She also met her daughter Elisabeth at Bayonne near the Spanish border, amidst lavish court festivities. Philip II excused himself from the occasion. He sent the Duke of Alba to tell Catherine to scrap the Edict of Amboise and to find punitive solutions to the problem of heresy.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{announcement}} of the joint rally, supporters of the movement for a Colbert-led march had begun <b>a</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> raise money for educational charities through DonorsChoose.org, a charitable organization of which Colbert {{is a member of the}} Board of Directors. In the first 24 hours, supporters raised over $100,000. In the days that followed, that total increased to over $250,000, and by the day of the rally over $500,000 had been contributed. Jon Stewart promoted the , urging his viewers to make donations on behalf of the rally. As of October 31, 2010, over $188,000 had been donated to the Trust.|$|E
5|$|Rabies {{has been}} linked with vampire folklore. Dr Juan Gómez-Alonso, a {{neurologist}} at Xeral Hospital in Vigo, Spain, examined this possibility in a report in Neurology. The susceptibility to garlic and light {{could be due to}} hypersensitivity, which is a symptom of rabies. The disease can also affect portions of the brain that could lead to disturbance of normal sleep patterns (thus becoming nocturnal) and hypersexuality. Legend once said a man was not rabid if he could look at his own reflection (an allusion to the legend that vampires have no reflection). Wolves and bats, which are often associated with vampires, can be carriers of rabies. The disease can also lead to <b>a</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> bite others and to a bloody frothing at the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Then the Colts faced their arch-rival New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game. New England {{jumped to}} an early 21–3 lead, but Indianapolis stormed {{back in the second}} half, outscoring the Patriots 32–13 with an {{additional}} field goal late in the first half. With 2:22 left in the game, the Colts had the ball on their own 20-yard line trailing 34–31. On the first four plays of the drive, Manning completed three passes, moving the ball 69yards to the Patriots 11-yard line in just 24 seconds. Three plays later, Addai scored a 3-yard touchdown run to put them in the lead, 38–34 with only 60 seconds left in regulation. The Patriots responded with <b>a</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> the Colts 45-yard line, but defensive back Marlin Jackson ended the drive with an interception to give Indianapolis the win. This happened to be the biggest comeback in AFC-NFC Conference Championship history.|$|E

5|$|After the post-score kickoff and return, Florida State {{began at}} its 22-yard line. Weinke {{completed}} a first-down pass to Warrick, but Warrick committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty in the process. On the next play, Weinke attempted a long pass downfield, but Tech defender Anthony Midget intercepted {{the ball at}} the Tech 41-yard line. Trailing by five, Tech's offense began <b>a</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> potentially further cut Florida State's lead or put the Hokies in the lead themselves. After slipping {{on the field and}} taking a loss, Vick completed a 20-yard pass to Hawkins, who picked up a first down and pushed Tech to the Florida State 39-yard line. After a short rush by Kendrick, Vick scrambled to the State 21-yard line for another first down. On the next play, Vick was sacked for a seven-yard loss, but recovered the lost ground by running for 22yards on the next play. With a first down at the Seminoles' seven-yard line, Vick handed the ball to Kendrick, who ran seven yards straight ahead for a Tech touchdown, giving the Hokies the lead {{for the first time in}} the game. Again, Beamer ordered a two-point conversion attempt, but again, Florida State stopped the Hokies short. Despite that failure to pick up the two-point conversion, Tech took a 2928 lead with 2:13 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|In November–December 1944, the Australian II Corps—consisting of Militia {{troops from}} the 3rd Division and the 11th Brigade—under Lieutenant General Stanley Savige took over {{responsibility}} for Allied operations on Bougainville from the American XIV Corps {{as part of a}} plan to free up the US troops for the fighting in the Philippines. Mistakenly believing that the Japanese forces on the island numbered just 17,500 men it was decided that the Australians should pursue an aggressive campaign to clear the Japanese from Bougainville. After taking over the US perimeter that had been established around Torokina, the Australian campaign developed into three separate drives: in the north, it was planned that Japanese forces would be forced into the narrow Bonis Peninsula and contained; in the centre the seizure of Pearl Ridge would give the Australians control of the east–west avenues of approach, as well as affording them protection against further counter-attacks, while also opening the way for <b>a</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> the east coast; and the main campaign in the south, where the bulk of the Japanese forces were concentrated. Allied estimates of Japanese strength were later found to be grossly inaccurate and after the war {{it was found that the}} number of Japanese alive on the island at this time was closer to 40,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{moved across}} the Rhine River at Worms, Germany on March 26, {{in the wake of}} the 3rd Infantry Division. The 44th relieved the 3rd on March 26–27 and crossed the Neckar River to attack and capture Mannheim, Germany on March 28–29. Shifting to the west bank of the Main River, the division crossed that river at Grosse Auheim in early April, and engaged in a three-week period of training. Returning to the lines, the division resumed its attack on April 18 in conjunction with the US 10th Armored Division, the 44th took Ehingen on April 23, crossed the Danube River. It then attacked southeast into Austria, taking Füssen, Berg, and Wertach as part of <b>a</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> Imst. Pursuing the disintegrating German forces through Fern Pass and into Inn Valley, the 44th was in Imst by May 4. The city of Landeck surrendered on May 5. The 19th German Army had surrendered at Innsbruck the same day, and the division was involved in processing German prisoners until V-E Day on May 8. Dean's troops took 30,000 prisoners of war in the surrender of the German army. Dean was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the Legion of Merit, and the Army Distinguished Service Medal for his leadership of the division during the war.|$|E
