5|$|The {{purchases}} of the diaries continued throughout {{mid to late}} 1981: Gruner + Jahr gave Heidemann 345,000DMs on 29 July, and a further 220,000DMs a week later, which brought the total up to 1.81millionDMs {{since the start of}} the year. This sum had purchased 18 diaries for the company. Schulte-Hillen, the new managing director, signed an <b>authorisation</b> <b>for</b> a further million DMs for future purchases. Just over two weeks later he signed a further <b>authorisation</b> <b>for</b> 600,000DMs after Heidemann told him that the cost of the diaries had now risen to 200,000DMs each; Heidemann also passed on the news that there were more than 27 diaries.|$|E

5|$|Rather than direct {{involvement}} in the European land war, the English Parliament preferred a relatively inexpensive naval attack on Spanish colonies in the New World, hoping for the capture of the Spanish treasure fleets. Parliament voted to grant a subsidy of £140,000, which was an insufficient sum for Charles's war plans. Moreover, the House of Commons limited its <b>authorisation</b> <b>for</b> royal collection of tonnage and poundage (two varieties of customs duties) to a period of one year, although previous sovereigns since Henry VI of England had been granted the right for life. In this manner, Parliament could delay approval of the rates until after a full-scale review of customs revenue. The bill made no progress in the House of Lords past its first reading. Although no Parliamentary Act for the levy of tonnage and poundage was obtained, Charles continued to collect the duties.|$|E

5|$|In 1872 Edward Watkin (1819–1901) was {{appointed}} as the Metropolitan Railway's Chairman. A director of many railway companies, {{he had a}} vision of unifying a string of railway companies to create a single route running from Manchester via London to an intended Channel Tunnel and on to France. In 1873 Watkin entered negotiations {{to take control of the}} Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and a section of the former Buckinghamshire Railway running north from Verney Junction to Buckingham. He planned to extend the MR north from London to Aylesbury to join the existing lines and create a direct route from London to the north of England. He also proposed to extend a short rail branch which ran from the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway to the small town of Brill, known as the Brill Tramway, southwest to Oxford, and thus create a through route from London to Oxford. Rail services between Oxford and London at this time were poor, and although still an extremely roundabout route, had the scheme been completed it would have formed the shortest route from London to Oxford, Aylesbury, Buckingham and Stratford upon Avon. The Duke of Buckingham, chairman of the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and owner of the Brill Tramway, was enthusiastic, and <b>authorisation</b> <b>for</b> the scheme was sought from Parliament. Parliament did not share the enthusiasm of Watkin and the Duke, and in 1875 the Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire Union Railway Bill was rejected.|$|E

No works having been undertaken by 1876, several local inhabitants, aware of the advantages of the railway and impatient for action, rallied together to sponsor a bill similar to the original 1864 bill. The line was to be built in two phases: phase one from Dunton Green via Brasted to Westerham, and phase two covering the 4 miles from Westerham to Oxted, where it would join the Oxted Line, {{the construction}} of which had not by then been completed.

Although {{he had been a}} sharer in the plans to construct the Globe Theatre, he appeared in no productions in the new theatre, which was open by mid-1599, and evidence from Shakespeare's Henry V, {{in which there is no}} promised continued role for Falstaff, and Hamlet, containing its famous complaint at improvisational clowning (Act 3, Scene 2), indicates some of the circumstances in which Kempe may have been dropped.
