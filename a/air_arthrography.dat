40|$|Intra-articular {{corticosteroid}} and {{hyaluronic acid}} injections provide short-term symptom amelioration for arthritic conditions involving structural damage or degenerative {{changes in the}} knee. Conventional palpation-guided anatomical injections frequently result in inaccurate needle placement into extra-articular tissue and adjacent structures. The purpose of this review {{was to determine the}} effect of ultrasound guidance on the accuracy of needle placement, clinical outcomes, and cost-effectiveness in comparison with anatomical landmark-guided intra-articular large joint injections, with particular emphasis on the knee. A total of 13 relevant studies were identified; five studied the knee, seven studied the shoulder, one used both the knee and shoulder, and none studied the hip. Ultrasound was used in seven studies; the remaining studies utilized <b>air</b> <b>arthrography,</b> fluoroscopy, magnetic resonance arthrography, or magnetic resonance imaging. Across all studies (using all imaging modalities and all joints), needle placement accuracy ranged from 63 % to 100 % with ultrasound and from 39 % to 100 % with conventional anatomical guidance. Imaging guidance improved the accuracy of intra-articular injections of the knee (96. 7 % versus 81. 0 %, P < 0. 001) and shoulder (97. 3 % versus 65. 4 %, P < 0. 001). In particular, ultrasound guidance of knee injections resulted in better accuracy than anatomical guidance (95. 8 % versus 77. 8 %, P < 0. 001), yielding an odds ratio of 6. 4 (95 % confidence interval 2. 9 â€“ 14). Ultrasound guidance notably improves injection accuracy in the target intra-articular joint space of large joints including the knee. The enhanced injection accuracy achieved with ultrasound needle guidance directly improves patient-reported clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness...|$|E

40|$|Arthrography {{is useful}} method to {{evaluate}} obstruct factors and the congruity of the femoral head for developmental dysplasia of the hip. We usually use an air injection {{to ascertain whether}} the needle is accurately insert intraarticularly, because leakage of the contrast medium may {{make it difficult to}} identify intraarticular structure in the hip joint. We report the experience the case that suspected air embolism by air injection in the arthrogram. An <b>air</b> injection for <b>arthrography</b> must be avoided the case of infants. To confirm that a needle is correctly inserted intraarticularly, it is preferable to inject saline. Alternatively, it may be suitable to use sonography for confirming the position of the needle for arthrography...|$|R
