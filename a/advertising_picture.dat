40|$|The <b>advertising</b> <b>picture</b> {{is today}} {{a complex and}} debated subject. Its {{constitution}} {{is a result of}} the norms of society, at the same time as it is a co-creater of them. The power and influence of the <b>advertising</b> <b>picture</b> in the creation of societal values, has for a long time been acknowledged among the feminist acadamia. It reproduces ideas of masculinity and femininity, which affects how we interpret and understand gender. Advertising is commonly associated with physical or visual adverts in newspapers, on tv or the internet. Something that is not usually seen as advertisement is underwear-pictures in web catalogues. All picture genres that intend to contribute to sales can however be seen as a form of advertisement since their purpose are to entice customers to consume. This picture genre seems to have been quite unexamined among the feminist acadamia, which makes it even more relevant.             This study aims to examine pictures in web catalogues of seven clothing companies (Asos, Bubbleroom, Ellos, Halens, Nelly, Shopbop and Zalando), with the purpose to analyze representations of gender. Focus lies on how male and female models are portrayed through body language and gaze while they show underwear. This is examined with theories about gender, masculinity and femininity, voyeurism and body language. The methods that are used is content analysis and semiotics. The combination of the methods aims to get an outline as well as a profound insight into how the clothing companies represent gender. The result of the analysis shows that men and women were stereotypically portrayed from masculine and feminine norms, and that the womens bodies were sexualised much more than mens. The conclusion of the study is therefore that the clothing companies represent routine-like ideas of masculinity and femininity, which contribute to and can bee seen as a part of the gender system...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about covers {{of books and}} DVD movies. I have {{tried to find out}} if the visual {{communication}} of the covers differs between the book and movie with the same story. Do they appeal to different target groups? I have also been trying to find out what designers can do to increase the visibility of covers among others. Are there certain rules to follow for making a cover visible? To reach a conclusion I have been studying components in <b>advertising</b> <b>pictures,</b> since covers work as a kind of advertiser for the product. I have also been studying visual communication and how designers use <b>advertising</b> <b>pictures</b> to communicate with the observer. Semiotics, advertising and comparisons between the covers have been my method for analyze. I have come to the colclusion that covers of books and DVD movies do communicate in different ways and partly to different target groups. There are certain rules to follow if you want to increase the visibility of a picture among others. The results indicate that the book covers have an older target group than the DVD covers...|$|R

Photography degrades most things, especially open-air things; and in this case, not only had its poor presentments made the scene too familiar, but something of the degradation in the <b>advertising</b> <b>pictures</b> seemed to attach itself to the very scene. Yet even here, after some pleasureless days spent in vain endeavours to shake off these vulgar associations, I was to experience one of the sweetest surprises and delights of my life.|$|R

40|$|Judged by {{the high}} level of gender {{stereotyping}} in advertising directed at children, advertising professionals apparently assume that this type of portrayal is appealing for them. This paper investigates the extent to which this assumption is correct. The study focused on ninety-six children in the age of 8 to 12 years in The Netherlands and on portrayals of characters in <b>advertising</b> <b>pictures.</b> Children judged a series of gender stereotypical and nonstereotypical photographs, in which adults or children advertised specific products. Children individually indicated which picture of a pair they considered as (a) most similar to reality, (b) most realistic as an advertisement, and (c) most likeable. Overall, children liked the stereotypical pictures better, and evaluated them as more similar to reality, and more like real advertisements. One type of pictures contradicted this general conclusion: the pictures that depicted girls in a tough pose (nonstereotypical) were liked better and were seen as more realistic advertisements than pictures where girls adopted a sweet pose (stereotypical) ...|$|R
40|$|In this article, past {{consumer}} research dealing with advertising images is analyzed and critiqued for its underlying assumption: that pictures are reflections of reality. The case against this assumption is presented, and an alternative view, in which visuals are a convention-based symbolic system, is formulated. In this alternative view, pictures must be cognitively processed, rather than absorbed peripherally or automatically. The author argues that current conceptualizations of advertising images are incommensurate with what ads are really like, {{and that many}} images currently dismissed as affect laden or information devoid are, in fact, complex figurative arguments. A new theoretical framework {{for the study of}} images is advanced in which advertising images are a sophisticated form of visual rhetoric. The process of consumer response implied by the new framework differs radically from past concepts in many ways, but also suggests new ways to approach questions currently open in the literature on the nature and processing of imagery. A pluralistic program for studying <b>advertising</b> <b>pictures</b> as persuasion is outlined...|$|R
