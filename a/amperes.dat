5|$|The {{configuration}} of the magnetodisk's field is maintained by the azimuthal ring current (not an analog of Earth's ring current), which flows with rotation through the equatorial plasma sheet. The Lorentz force resulting from the interaction of this current with the planetary magnetic field creates a centripetal force, which keeps the co-rotating plasma from escaping the planet. The total ring current in the equatorial current sheet is estimated at 90–160million <b>amperes.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} of electric charge {{is known as}} an electric current, the intensity of which is usually measured in <b>amperes.</b> Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.|$|E
5|$|The {{current flowing}} from the {{ionosphere}} to the plasma sheet is especially strong when the corresponding part of the plasma sheet rotates slower than the planet. As mentioned above, co-rotation breaks down in the region located between 20 and 40RJ from Jupiter. This region corresponds to the magnetodisk, where the magnetic field is highly stretched. The strong direct current flowing into the magnetodisk originates in a very limited latitudinal range of about ° from the Jovian magnetic poles. These narrow circular regions correspond to Jupiter's main auroral ovals. (See below.) The return current {{flowing from the}} outer magnetosphere beyond 50RJ enters the Jovian ionosphere near the poles, closing the electrical circuit. The total radial current in the Jovian magnetosphere is estimated at 60 million–140million <b>amperes.</b>|$|E

The iPad {{is designed to be}} charged with a high current of 2 <b>amperes</b> using the included 10 W USB power adapter and USB cord with a USB connector at one end and a 30-pin dock connector at the other end. While it can be charged by a standard USB port from a computer, these are limited to 500 milliamperes (0.5 amps). As a result, if the iPad is running while powered by a normal USB computer port, it may charge very slowly, or not at all. High-power USB ports found in newer Apple computers and accessories provide full charging capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Io plays a {{significant}} role in shaping Jupiter's magnetic field, acting as an electric generator that can develop 400,000 volts across itself and create an electric current of 3 million <b>amperes,</b> releasing ions that give Jupiter a magnetic field inflated to more than twice the size it would otherwise have. The magnetosphere of Jupiter sweeps up gases and dust from Io's thin atmosphere at a rate of 1tonne per second. This material is mostly composed of ionized and atomic sulfur, oxygen and chlorine; atomic sodium and potassium; molecular sulfur dioxide and sulfur; and sodium chloride dust. These materials originate from Io's volcanic activity, but the material that escapes to Jupiter's magnetic field and into interplanetary space comes directly from Io's atmosphere. These materials, depending on their ionized state and composition, end up in various neutral (non-ionized) clouds and radiation belts in Jupiter's magnetosphere and, in some cases, are eventually ejected from the Jovian system.|$|E

50|$|In 1888, he {{was named}} Lycée <b>Ampère</b> as tribute to the {{physician}} André-Marie <b>Ampère.</b>|$|R
50|$|Born in Lyon, he was {{the only}} son of the {{physicist}} André-Marie <b>Ampère</b> (1775-1836). Jean-Jacques' mother died while he was an infant. (But André-Marie <b>Ampère</b> had a daughter - Albine (1807-1842) - with his second wife.) On his tomb at the cemetry of Montmatre, Paris he is named Jean-Jacques Antoine <b>Ampère.</b> His fathers father was also named Jean-Jacques <b>Ampère</b> (executed in Lyon, 1793).|$|R
5000|$|Andre-Marie <b>Ampère</b> {{was born}} on 20 January 1775 to Jean-Jacques <b>Ampère,</b> a prosperous businessman, and Jeanne Antoinette Desutières-Sarcey <b>Ampère,</b> {{during the height of}} the French Enlightenment. He spent his {{childhood}} and adolescence at the family property at Poleymieux-au-Mont-d'Or near Lyon. Jean-Jacques <b>Ampère,</b> a successful merchant, was an admirer of the philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose theories of education (as outlined in his treatise Émile) were the basis of <b>Ampère's</b> education. Rousseau believed that young boys should avoid formal schooling and pursue instead an [...] "education direct from nature." [...] <b>Ampère's</b> father actualized this ideal by allowing his son to educate himself within the walls of his well-stocked library. French Enlightenment masterpieces such as Georges-Louis Leclerc, comte de Buffon's Histoire naturelle, générale et particulière (begun in 1749) and Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert's Encyclopédie (volumes added between 1751 and 1772) thus became <b>Ampère's</b> schoolmasters. The young <b>Ampère,</b> however, soon resumed his Latin lessons, which enabled him to master the works of Leonhard Euler and Daniel Bernoulli.|$|R
25|$|Distribution {{power systems}} may be solidly grounded, with one circuit {{conductor}} {{directly connected to}} an earth grounding electrode system. Alternatively, some amount of electrical impedance may be connected between the distribution system and ground, to limit the current that can flow to earth. The impedance may be a resistor, or an inductor (coil). In a high-impedance grounded system, the fault current {{is limited to a}} few <b>amperes</b> (exact values depend on the voltage class of the system); a low-impedance grounded system will permit several hundred <b>amperes</b> to flow on a fault. A large solidly grounded distribution system may have thousands of <b>amperes</b> of ground fault current.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} planned {{would be the}} Z-IFE (Z-inertial fusion energy) test facility, the first true z-pinch driven {{prototype}} fusion power plant. It is suggested it would integrate Sandia's latest designs using LTDs. Sandia labs recently proposed a conceptual 1 petawatt (1015 watts) LTD Z-pinch power plant, where the electric discharge would reach 70 million <b>amperes.</b> As of 2012, fusion shot simulations at 60 to 70 million <b>amperes</b> are showing a 100 to 1000 fold return on input energy.

2500|$|In {{classical}} electromagnetism, <b>Ampère's</b> circuital law (not to {{be confused}} with <b>Ampère's</b> force law that André-Marie <b>Ampère</b> discovered in 1823) relates the integrated magnetic field around a closed loop to the electric current passing through the loop.

25|$|Positive {{lightning}} strikes {{tend to be}} much more intense than their negative counterparts. An average bolt of negative lightning carries an electric current of 30,000 <b>amperes</b> (30 kA), and transfers 15 coulombs of electric charge and 500 megajoules of energy. Large bolts of negative lightning can carry up to 120 kA and 350 coulombs. The average positive ground flash has roughly double the peak current of a typical negative flash, and can produce peak currents up to 400,000 <b>amperes</b> (400 kA) and charges of several hundreds coulombs. Furthermore, positive ground flashes with high peak currents are commonly followed by long continuing currents, a correlation not seen in negative ground flashes.|$|E

50|$|Extending these experiments, <b>Ampère</b> {{published}} his own successful model of magnetism in 1825. In it, {{he showed the}} equivalence of electrical currents to magnets and proposed that magnetism is due to perpetually flowing loops of current instead of the dipoles of magnetic charge in Poisson's model. This has the additional benefit of explaining why magnetic charge can not be isolated. Further, <b>Ampère</b> derived both <b>Ampère's</b> force law describing the force between two currents and <b>Ampère's</b> law, which, like the Biot-Savart law, correctly described the magnetic field generated by a steady current. Also in this work, <b>Ampère</b> introduced the term electrodynamics to describe the relationship between electricity and magnetism.|$|R

25|$|Valve electrometers use a {{specialized}} vacuum tube (thermionic valve) {{with a very}} high gain (transconductance) and input resistance. The input current is allowed to flow into the high impedance grid, and the voltage so generated is vastly amplified in the anode (plate) circuit.
