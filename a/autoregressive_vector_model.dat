40|$|A spatio-temporal {{method for}} {{producing}} very-short-term parametric probabilistic wind power forecasts {{at a large}} number of locations is presented. Smart grids containing tens, or hundreds, of wind generators require skilled very-short-term forecasts to operate effectively, and spatial information is highly desirable. In addition, probabilistic forecasts are widely regarded as necessary for optimal power system management as they quantify the uncertainty associated with point forecasts. Here we work within a parametric framework based on the logit-normal distribution and forecast its parameters. The location parameter for multiple wind farms is modelled as a vector-valued spatio-temporal process, and the scale parameter is tracked by modified exponential smoothing. A state-of-the-art technique for fitting sparse <b>vector</b> <b>autoregressive</b> <b>models</b> is employed to model the location parameter and demonstrates numerical advantages over conventional <b>vector</b> <b>autoregressive</b> <b>models.</b> The proposed method is tested on a dataset of 5 minute mean wind power generation at 22 wind farms in Australia. 5 -minute-ahead forecasts are produced and evaluated in terms of point and probabilistic forecast skill scores and calibration.

40|$|Diversos são os determinantes do investimento direto estrangeiro (IDE), como a disponibilidade de infra-estrutura adequada, a taxa de câmbio do país receptor, o desenvolvimento do sistema financeiro interno da economia, a estabilidade econômica, a carga tributária, o grau de abertura econômica, dentre muitos outros. No entanto, o impacto que o IDE exerce sobre o crescimento econômico é determinado pelo grau de desenvolvimento desses determinantes. O objetivo geral do presente estudo {{consiste}} em analisar as relações existentes entre os fluxos de IDE e o crescimento econômico para a economia brasileira no período de 1986 a 2009. A metodologia adotada é o Modelo Auto-Regressivo Vetorial Estrutural (VAR Estrutural) através do procedimento desenvolvido por Bernanke (1986). Os resultados apontam, por um lado, para uma relação positiva entre investimento direto estrangeiro e crescimento econômico. Por outro lado, destacam um conjunto de três variáveis que exercem efeito determinante na atração desse tipo de investimento: infra-estrutura, taxa de câmbio e desenvolvimento do sistema financeiro. O impacto que o IDE exerce na economia brasileira, apesar de se mostrar positivo e significativo, apresenta-se baixo. Essa deficiência pode estar relacionada a alguns fatores, como por exemplo, a constatação de que os investimentos diretos estrangeiros direcionaram-se prioritariamente ao setor de serviços da economia. Além disso, parcela significativa do IDE direcionado ao Brasil ingressou através de fusões e aquisições durante o processo de privatizações iniciado na década de 1990, e não por meio de novos investimentos. Em adição, fatores como, por exemplo, a disponibilidade inadequada de infra-estrutura podem estar relacionados com a baixa contribuição do IDE no crescimento econômico, sugerindo que a formulação de políticas públicas que busquem o crescimento econômico deveria direcionar esforços no suprimento de apropriada infra-estrutura que faça com que o IDE tenha um desempenho mais pujante no crescimento do produto. Logo, políticas públicas voltadas para o crescimento deveriam caminhar {{pari passu}} com políticas que encorajem os fluxos entrantes de investimento estrangeiro na economia nacional, ao passo que essas ações necessitam estar em sintonia com os principais determinantes do IDE no Brasil. There are several determinants of {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI), such as the availability of adequate infrastructure, the exchange rate of the host country, {{the development of the}} financial system of the domestic economy, economic stability, taxation, the degree of economic openness, among many others. However, the impact that FDI has on economic growth is determined by the degree of development of these determinants. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine the relationship between FDI flows and economic growth. Specifically, we seek to examine to what extent the flow of incoming FDI in Brazil responded to changes in the coefficients of its main determinants in the period of 1986 to 2009. The database is the Institute of Applied Economic Research (IPEA). The methodology used is the Structural <b>Autoregressive</b> <b>Vector</b> <b>Model</b> (Structural VAR) using the procedure developed by Bernanke (1986). The results indicate, first, for a positive relationship between foreign direct investment and economic growth. On the other hand, we highlight a set of three variables that exert a role in attracting this type of investment: infrastructure, exchange rate and development of the financial system. The impact that FDI plays in the Brazilian economy, although positive and significant, is presented in a low level. The impairment may be related to some factors, such as the finding that FDI is primarily directed to the service sector of the economy. Furthermore, a significant portion of FDI directed to Brazil entered through mergers and acquisitions during the privatization process started in the 1990 s, not through new investments. In addition, factors such as the inadequate availability of infrastructure may be related to the low contribution of FDI on economic growth, suggesting that the formulation of public policies that seek to economic growth should direct efforts in the supply of appropriate infrastructure to causes that the IDE has a more vigorous growth performance of the product. Therefore, public policies for growth should go hand in hand with policies that encourage the flow of incoming foreign investment in the national economy, while these actions need to be in line with the main determinants of FDI in Brazil...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} the relationship between market sentiment and rates of return on the main Portuguese benchmark and verify whether this relationship is influenced by different economic cycles. Given the subjectivity inherent to the use of variables capturing investor sentiment, the Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) was used as a benchmark. To achieve the proposed objective, an analysis of time series stationarity, Pearson correlation, and Granger causality using the <b>autoregressive</b> <b>vectors</b> <b>model</b> was carried out, followed by the Least Squares Method with macroeconomic variables. The results obtained suggest a one-way relationship between stock market returns and the sentiment variable. In fact, in times of recession, investor pessimism induces linear behavior and the sentiment-return relationship is more evident.
