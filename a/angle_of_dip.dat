50|$|On {{the southeastern}} {{side of the}} anticline, there are several smaller {{cross-cutting}} faults locally disturbing the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>dip.</b> These cross faults are all following Riedel directions, either the R- or the R'-position, hinting at an underlying shear zone.|$|E

30|$|From Eq. (3), the {{magnitude}} of the P 2 force is linearly proportional to the <b>dip</b> <b>angle</b> regardless <b>of</b> the <b>dip</b> length. Figure  7 b and c shows the dynamic wheel forces (P 2 forces are from their low-pass filtering) and axle box accelerations. It can be seen that their magnitudes are related to the <b>dip</b> <b>angles</b> regardless <b>of</b> the <b>dip</b> length, but their frequencies are not related to either dip angles or dip lengths. Therefore, the relationship between the accelerations on a locomotive component and the <b>dip</b> <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>dipped</b> rail defects is important for monitoring the development of those defects.|$|R

50|$|Henry Gellibrand (1597 - 1637) was an English mathematician. He {{is known}} for his work on the Earth's {{magnetic}} field.

He announced this in 1635, relying on previous observations by others, which had not yet been correctly interpreted.|$|E
50|$|Schrofen is a German {{mountaineering}} {{term that}} refers to steep terrain, strewn with rocks and rock outcrops, that is laborious to cross, but whose rock ledges (schrofen) offer many good steps and hand holds. It is usually rocky terrain on which grass has established itself, {{but it can also}} refer to purely rocky slopes. Schrofen are found especially where the rock has broken off against its <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>dip.</b>|$|E
50|$|All {{gradations}} {{occur between}} hogbacks, homoclinal ridges, and cuestas. The {{differences between these}} landforms {{are related to the}} steepness in dip of the resistant beds from which they have been eroded and to their geographic extent. Where hogback, homoclinal ridges, and cuestas occur depends upon whether the local rock attitudes are either nearly vertical, moderately dipping, or gently dipping. Because of their gradational nature, the exact <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>dip</b> and slope that separates these landforms is arbitrary and some differences in the specific angles used to define these landforms {{can be found in the}} scientific literature. In addition, it also can be difficult to distinguish sharply immediately adjacent members of this series of landforms because of their gradational nature.|$|E
30|$|The {{detailed}} locomotive {{model is}} considered to be reliable for several reasons. Firstly, it has been generated based on the GENSYSMBS software package which was validated during the Manchester Benchmark tests [27] and is now widely endorsed by the global railway industry. Furthermore, the modelling of locomotives of this type has been verified by experimental data available to the authors [23, 28, 29], but which are confidential and currently only available for internal use. Therefore, based on the acceleration measurements, the real <b>dip</b> <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>dipped</b> rail defects can be approximately determined, which will be helpful for future rail maintenance decision making.|$|R

Thermal changes in slabs subducting into the Venusian mantle with a range of initial geotherms are used to predict density changes and, thus, slab buoyancy. Based on a model for subduction-induced mantle flow, it is then argued that the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> the slab <b>dip</b> helps differentiate between underthrusting and subduction. Mantle flow applies torques to the slab which, in combination with torques due to slab buoyancy, act to change the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> slab <b>dip...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we relax the strong {{limiting}} condition of parallel layering which is usually assumed in seismic modeling by allowing dipping boundaries. We start with the derivation of generalized ray theory in a wedge-shaped medium with free and rigid boundaries. Then, {{through the development of}} the method of equivalent models and de-Hoop contours, we extend the theory to dipping structure with elastic boundaries. The effect <b>of</b> a <b>dipping</b> interface over a half-space for the case of a line source is shown by a series of numerical models which include various <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>dip</b> and source-to-receiver distances. Results for a line source situated below the layer indicate that, when the layer thickens toward the receiver, one obtains a wave form similar to the case where the source is actually in the layer. These features are produced by the combination of forward and backward traveling rays which can have super-critical reflections...|$|R
50|$|The {{erosion of}} tilted {{sequences}} of either stratified sedimentary or igneous rock, homoclines, of alternating resistance to erosion produce distinctive landforms that form a gradational continuum from cuestas through homoclinal ridges to hogbacks. Less resistant beds are preferentially eroded creating valleys that lie between ridges {{created by the}} erosion of more resistant beds. For example, the erosion of homoclines consisting of resistant beds of either limestone, sandstone, or both interbedded with weaker, less resistant beds of either shale, siltstone, marl, or combination of them will produce either cuestas, homoclinal ridges, or hogbacks depending on the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>dip</b> of the strata. The greater {{the difference in the}} resistance to erosion, the more pronounced the structural control and relief between valley and ridge crest.|$|E

50|$|In {{structural}} geology, a homocline or homoclinal structure, (from old homo = same, cline = inclination) is a geological {{structure in}} which the bedding of a sequence of rock strata, either sedimentary or igneous, dips uniformly in a single direction having the same general inclination in terms of direction and angle. A homocline {{can be associated with}} either one limb of a fold, the edges of a dome, the coast-ward tilted strata underlying a coastal plain, slice of thrust fault, or a tilted fault block. When the homoclinal strata consists of alternating beds of rock that vary hardness and resistance to erosion, their erosion produces either cuestas, homoclinal ridges, or hogbacks depending on the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>dip</b> of the strata. On a topographic map, the landfroms associated with homoclines exhibit nearly parallel elevation contour lines that show a steady change in elevation in a given direction. In the subsurface, they characterize by parallel structural contour lines.|$|E
50|$|The sixteen stamp mill, {{erected in}} 1866, had a {{capacity}} of crushing about two tons to the stamp daily. The water in this mine was light, a supply {{for the use of}} the amalgamation works being derived from a neighboring ditch company.

40|$|Banded {{ferruginous}} quartzites form {{a conspicuous}} feature {{of many of}} the outcrops of Dharwar schists in Mysore. Because of their much greater hardness than the associated chloritic and hornblendic schists, these quartzites have withstood the action of weathering agencies better, and form prominent hill ranges in the schist belts. One such important range is the Bababudan hills in the Kadur district, comprising some of the highest peaks in the Mysore State, several of which are over 6, 000 feet above sea-level. The Bababudan hills are mainly composed of thick beds of haematite and magnetite quartzites which are separated by bands of chloritic and talcose schists. The high <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>dip</b> and the intensely folded nature of these quartzites are evidences of the great disturbances to which these rocks have been subjected. The complicated tectonics of this area have not yet been satisfactorily elucidated, as geological work on these hills is heavily handicapped by the dense jungles infested with wild animals, and the thick soil cap which obscures the disposition and relationship of the rocks. The ferruginous quartzites overlie an epidiorite flow of spilitic affinities. A few dykes of epidiorite, some of which are tourmaline-bearing, have invaded the quartzites...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} dynamic {{model for the}} {{behavior}} of an AC undervoltage protection relay during voltage dips. The behavior is expressed by means of standardized voltage tolerance curves and highly depends on the point on-wave (phase <b>angle)</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dip</b> initiation. Using the model, it can be explained that AC undervoltage relays are much more sensitive to voltage <b>dips</b> <b>of</b> e. g. 50 % Urated than to short interruptions (0 % Urated), caused by the magnetic behavior. The model {{takes into account the}} electrical, magnetic and mechanical system equations. An experimental set-up with a programmable power source as dipgenerator is build to validate the model. Finally, a complete weaving machine is represented to analyze the influence towards voltage dip immunity by adding an undervoltage protection relay...|$|R
50|$|The dip {{gives the}} steepest angle of descent of a tilted bed or feature {{relative}} to a horizontal plane, and is given by the number (0°-90°) {{as well as a}} letter (N,S,E,W) with rough direction in which the bed is dipping downwards. One technique is to always take the strike so the dip is 90° {{to the right of the}} strike, in which case the redundant letter following the dip angle is omitted (right hand rule, or RHR). The map symbol is a short line attached and at right angles to the strike symbol pointing in the direction which the planar surface is dipping down. The <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>dip</b> is generally included on a geologic map without the degree sign. Beds that are dipping vertically are shown with the dip symbol on both sides of the strike, and beds that are flat are shown like the vertical beds, but with a circle around them. Both vertical and flat beds do not have a number written with them.|$|E
50|$|The Brandberg Massif or Brandberg Intrusion is a {{granitic}} intrusion, {{which forms}} a dome-shaped massif. It originated during Early Cretaceous rifting {{that led to}} the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean. Argon-argon dating yielded intrusive ages of 132 to 130 Ma. The dominant plutonic rock is a homogeneous medium grained biotite-hornblende granite. In the western interior of the massif (Naib gorge), a 2 km in diameter body of pyroxene-bearing monzonite is exposed. The youngest intrusive rocks based on cross-cutting relations are arfvedsonite granite dikes and sills in the southwestern periphery of the Brandberg massif which crop out in the Amis valley. The arfvedsonite granites contain minerals rich in rare-earth element minerals such as pyrochlore and bastnaesite. Remnants of Cretaceous volcanic rocks are preserved in a collar along the western and southern margins of the massif. Their <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>dip</b> increases towards the contact where clasts of country-rock occur within the granite forming a magmatic breccia. The origins of the magmas that formed the Brandberg intrusion are related to emplacement of mantle-derived basaltic magma during continental break-up which led to partial melting of crustal rocks resulting in a hybrid granitic magma. Erosion subsequently removed the overburden rock. Apatite fission track dating indicates approximately 5 km denudation between 80 and 60 Ma.|$|E
50|$|The <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>dip</b> of the subducting slab, and {{therefore}} the Benioff seismic zone, is dominantly controlled by the negative buoyancy of the slab and forces from the flowing of the asthenosphere. Younger lithosphere is hotter and more buoyant, resulting in shallow-dipping Benioff zones, whereas older lithosphere is denser and colder, causing steeper dips. The Benioff zone spans from near-surface to depths of up to 670 km. The upper bound is just beneath the weak sediments in the toe of the wedge of the subduction zone and the lower bound is where the brittle-ductile transition occurs. Most earthquakes occur within the 1000 °C isotherm, {{in the interior of}} the slab that has not yet heated up to match the temperature of the surrounding mantle into which it is being subducted. At depths below the thickness of the lithosphere, earthquakes are no longer generated by thrusting at the interface of the two plates, because the asthenosphere is weak and cannot support the stresses necessary for faulting. In this region, internal deformation of the still-cool down-going slab {{is the source of the}} earthquakes. Up to depths of 300 km, dehydration reactions and the formation of eclogite are the main causes of seismicity. Below 300 km, beginning at approximately the 700 °C isotherm, a mineralogical phase change from olivine to spinel occurs, and is thought to be the dominant earthquake mechanism of these very deep-seated earthquakes.|$|E
40|$|Fractures {{constitute}} some of {{the most}} permeable groundwater migration pathways. The directional regularity of fracture sets largely determines the hydraulic anisotropy (single- or multi-directional) of fractured rocks. Knowledge of the preferential directions of possible water flow and pollutant migration paths along fracture-controlled azimuths is useful for understanding the flow patterns and spread of pollutants in a given aquifer. Yet systematic regional fracture mapping is still rare in hydrogeological studies. To assist in ongoing predictive modelling of mine water pollution plume migration within the Magnesian Limestone Aquifer (Permian) in County Durham, U. K., a survey was undertaken of basic fracture characteristics, including <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>dip,</b> strike directions, aperture and frequency. These parameters were measured both in natural exposures and working quarries across the outcrop of the aquifer in the study area. Scrutiny of the measurements reveals the presence of two major fracture sets, one oriented WNW to NNW and the other oriented NNE to ENE. These are likely to be extensional joints, with perhaps a few minor faults, that form reasonably consistent conjugate sets distributed across the Permian outcrop, and suggest that the permeability tensor in the aquifer is also likely to have axes oriented with maxima trending NNE to ENE. This is only slightly oblique to the general eastward trend of groundwater flow towards the coast, suggesting a mild tendency to sinistral preference in transverse dispersivity...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} predict the ground {{movement}} using the GIS functions, the following data, such as calculation points, extraction panels and subsidence parameters should be prepared at first. Meanwhile, the input parameters for ground movement calculations could be separated into two categories. The first one is the generation of surface grid points for providing calculation points, including the distance of each grid point in the x and y directions, in which the number of points along the grid lines, the number of grid lines, point intervals along the grid lines, and the grid-line directions need to be established. The second one is entering the calculation data of ground movement, including the extraction panel sequence ID, seam upward <b>angle,</b> inclination <b>of</b> <b>dip,</b> subsidence factor, excavation thickness, horizontal-movement factor, <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> draw and time factor. Since the ground movement is calculated only with the above entering data, the calculation results of each panel would be uncertain once the input data are uncertain.|$|R
50|$|The <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> repose, or {{critical}} <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> repose, of a {{granular material}} is the steepest <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> descent or <b>dip</b> {{relative to the}} horizontal plane to which a material can be piled without slumping. At this angle, the material on the slope face {{is on the verge}} <b>of</b> sliding. The <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> repose can range from 0° to 90°. The morphology of the material affects the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> repose; smooth, rounded sand grains cannot be piled as steeply as can rough, interlocking sands. The <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> repose can also be affected by additions of solvents; if a small amount of water is able to bridge the gaps between particles, electrostatic attraction of the water to mineral surfaces will increase the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> repose, and related quantities such as the soil strength.|$|R
30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to review the major points of {{contention}} concerning secondary petroleum migration, to discuss the nature and primary controls of the positions of petroleum migration pathways in sedimentary basins, and to illustrate the importance of preferential petroleum migration pathways for the formation of large oil/gas fields away from generative kitchens. There is competition between the driving force (buoyancy) and the restraining force (capillary pressure controlled largely by permeability contrast) in controlling the positions of petroleum migration pathways in heterogeneous carrier beds. At a large scale, there is a critical <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>dip</b> of the carrier beds which determines the relative importance of structural morphology or permeability contrasts in controlling the positions of petroleum migration pathways in heterogeneous carrier beds. Maximum-driving-force-controlled migration pathways occur in carrier beds with an <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>dip</b> greater than the critical dip and the positions of petroleum migration pathways are controlled mainly by the morphology of the sealing surfaces. Minimum-restraining-force-determined migration pathways occur in carrier beds with an <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>dip</b> smaller than the critical angle where permeability contrasts would exert a more important influence on the positions of petroleum migration pathways. Preferential petroleum migration pathways (PPMP), defined as very restricted portions of carrier-beds that focus or concentrate petroleum from a large area of the generative kitchen, determine the distribution of oil and gas in sedimentary basins. The focusing of petroleum originating from a large area of the generative kitchens into restricted channels seems to be essential not only for long-range petroleum migration in hydrostatic conditions, but also for the formation of large oil or gas fields. Regions may miss out on petroleum migration because of its three-dimensional behavior, and two-dimensional migration modeling may be misleading in predicting petroleum occurrences in certain circumstances.|$|E

In particular, when the incident angle is close to the critical <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> total reflection for LCP wave, significant enhancement of the GH shifts can be obtained.

40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} stress {{measurements and}} a borehole televiewer log were obtained in hole USW G- 2 at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, to depths of 1200 m. Results indicate {{that at the}} depths tested, the minimum and maximum horizontal stresses are less than the vertical stress, corresponding to a normal faulting stress regime. Drilling-induced hydrofractures seen in the televiewer log imply a least horizontal principal stress direction of N 60 ° W to N 65 ° W. For reasonable values of the coefficient of friction, {{the magnitude of the}} least horizontal stress is close to the value at which slip would occur on preexisting faults of optimal orientation (strike N 25 ° E to N 30 ° E and dipping 60 ° to 67 °). The prominent drilling-induced fractures seen in the televiewer log are believed to have been caused by excess downhole pressures applied during drilling the hole. Many throughgoing fractures are also seen in the televiewer log; most of these are high angle, stringking N 10 ° E to N 40 ° E. These fractures show a general decrease in <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>dip</b> with depth. Stress-induced wellbore breakouts are seen at depths below 1050 m.

40|$|Physical {{experiments}} have been undertaken {{to investigate the}} influence of planar rheological anisotropy on the orientation of fault structures in three-dimensional flow associated with layer-normal shortening. The experimental results indicate that plane strain is a special case, characterised by the lowest angle between the faults and the principal extension direction for any combination of rheology and flow type during progressive pure shear. A model is proposed wherein {{the role of the}} anisotropy appears to be two-fold. First, it determines that shear bands operate internally by a mechanism involving rotating slip surfaces during fault nucleation. The initial orientation of the faults is determined by the optimisation of the driving processes in the propagating shear bands as a partial function of the angle they make with the external anisotropy. Second, it induces directionally dependent variation in the resistance to flow, which manifests itself differently according to the symmetry of the strain ellipsoid in three dimensions (X> Y va 1 > Z). In flattening flow, it is proposed that anisotropy-induced geometrical hardening leads to an increase in the angles made by the shear bands with the principal extension directions of the deformation. In constriction, the same effect is seen in XZ sections, but in YZ sections it is suggested that the wide range of fault orientations observed is due to anisotropy-induced geometrical softening. It is possible that the low <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>dip</b> of crustal-scale extensional detachment faults may reflect anisotropic behaviour of the lower continental crust...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new model of P and S {{velocity}} anomalies in the mantle down to a depth of 1300 km beneath the Izu-Bonin and Mariana (IBM) arcs. This model is derived based on tomographic inversion of global travel time data from the revised ISC catalogue. The results of inversion are thoroughly verified using a series of different tests. The obtained model is generally consistent with previous studies by different authors. We also present the distribution of relocated deep events projected to the vertical surface along the IBM arc system. Unexpectedly, the seismicity forms elongated vertical clusters instead of horizontal zones indicating phase transitions in the slab. We propose that these vertical seismicity zones mark zones of intense deformation and boundaries between semi-autonomous segments of the subducting plate. The P and S seismic tomography models consistently display the slab as prominent high-velocity anomalies coinciding with the distribution of deep seismicity. We can distinguish at least four segments which subduct differently. The northernmost segment of the Izu-Bonin arc has the gentlest <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>dipping</b> which is explained by backward displacement of the trench. In the second segment, the trench stayed at the same location, and we observe the accumulation of the slab material in the transition zone and its further descending to the lower mantle. In the third segment, the trench is moving forward causing the steepening of the slab. Finally, for the Mariana segment, despite the backward displacement of the arc, the subducting slab is nearly vertical. Between the Izu-Bonin and Mariana arcs we clearly observe a gap which can be traced down to about 400 km in depth. Based on joint consideration of the tomography results and the seismicity distribution, we propose two different scenarios of the subduction evolution in the IBM zone during the recent time, depending on the reference frame of plate displacements. In the first case, we consider the movements in respect to the Philippine Plate, and explain the different styles of the subduction by the relative backward and forward migrations of the trench. In the second case, all the elements of the subduction system move westward in respect to the stable Asia. Different subduction styles are explained by the "anchoring" of selected segments of the slab, different physical properties of the subducting plate and the existence of buoyant rigid blocks related to sea mount and igneous provinces...|$|R
