5|$|Early Seventies Britain {{was a very}} {{depressing}} {{place with}} both the colour strike and the UK postal workers strike in full swing. It was completely run-down with trash on the streets, and total unemployment—just about everybody was on strike. Everybody was brought up with an education system that told you point blank that if you came from {{the wrong side of}} the tracks...then you had no hope in hell and no career prospects at all. Out of that came pretentious moi and the Sex Pistols and then <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> copycat wankers after us.|$|E

Sitting across from me was a black preacher with a white collar. He was an AME preacher. We talked. Every now and then, people on the bus sang 'Oh Freedom' and 'We Shall Overcome,' {{but for the most}} part there wasn't <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> singing.

Cicero mentions the idea that Cato is overshadowed by other figures, but is still noteworthy. After Cato, <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> orators appeared in Rome like Severius Galba. He also provides an example of how Galba was able to win over the court with an amazing, eloquent speech and that his people (in a court case) were freed from all charges.|$|R

He coordinated tones with the clergy so they and the choir remained in harmony. Yet, during the service he could quickly adjust the choir's pitch to fit the intonation of the clergy when necessary. For Victor, the services were <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> not <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> pieces. In this even, Metropolitan Sergius was careful, often heard coordinating on which Cherubic hymn version Victor would sing that day so that he could decide on his pitch.|$|R
500|$|Former {{executives}} at Sega have mixed {{opinions of the}} 32X. [...] Bayless believes firmly that the 32X serves {{as a warning to}} the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the Kinect and PlayStation Move for doing so. [...] Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, [...] "The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a CD drive and was an add-on. [...] An add-on device is never as well thought out as a built-from-scratch device." [...] Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, [...] "I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to stick with it, given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited. There were <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> reasons why we couldn’t ultimately do what we had to do with that platform, without third party support and with the timing of Saturn, but I still think the project was a success for a bunch of other reasons. In hindsight, it was not a great idea for <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> other reasons." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1994, Jackson {{spoke to}} a Billboard {{reporter}} about digital audio. Described as Apogee's president and chief engineer, he said, [...] "digital is finally living up to the warm, natural sound of analogue that we know and love." [...] A decade later, he warned against the belief that bigger specification numbers guarantee better sound quality. He noted that 192kHz sampling rate was often cited as being better than 96kHz because of it being twice as fast [...] "when in reality there's <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> other influencing factors responsible for any audible improvements." ...|$|E
500|$|Morrison said {{afterwards}} that he [...] "wasn't very happy" [...] with it.

It was <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> songs that had been hanging around for a while. [...] I was really {{trying to make a}} country and western album." [...] He commented further that he seldom listened to it and had a bad taste in his mouth for both Street Choir and Tupelo Honey.|$|E
5000|$|Erin Miller from TV Week {{praised the}} series, saying [...] "Wonderland {{is a lot}} of fun. Its sexy, {{relatable}} and features a group of friends youll wish were your mates. Sure it echoes The Secret Life of Us, but this is <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> twentysomethings whose relationship and work issues will draw you in." [...] Miller added that she was looking forward to catching up with the gang every week. David Knox from TV Tonight gave the series a mixed review and pointed out that it [...] "feels too white-bread to reasonably reflect suburban Australia". He also observed that the characters are all heterosexual and only one cast member is over 40. Knox commented [...] "Wonderland boasts TVs sexiest cast, which compensates for material that is sometimes pedestrian and antics used in place of character-based humour." [...] He added that the series begins [...] "from a pleasant launch pad, but has big shoes to fill in the Offspring slot. With a bit more grunt it may just get there." ...|$|R
40|$|Este {{proyecto}} trata de analizar la viabilidad económica de dos tipos de sistemas de tecnologías minieólicas (vertical y horizontal) aplicadas sobre una vivienda unifamiliar situada en Madrid en régimen de balance neto, de próxima aprobación. En primer lugar se expondrá cuál es el estado actual del autoconsumo en España y en el mundo así como el balance neto. Por otro lado se analizará también y se desarrollarán ambas tecnologías minieólicas, describiendo sus principales características y componentes. Se explicará también cuál es su funcionamiento y que alternativas existen para su instalación. Se predimensionarán los dos tipos de tecnologías minieólicas utilizadas para aplicarlas sobre el caso de estudio, tomando como base el consumo energético de la vivienda objetos de estudio. Conocidos los costes de la instalación que satisfacen dichas necesidades energéticas, se valorará la viabilidad económica de los miniproyectos, analizando las variables económicas más relevantes, tales como el VAN, TIR y retorno de la inversión, considerando varias hipótesis de instalación y varias hipótesis sobre el mercado eléctrico. Finalmente se expondrán una serie de conclusiones derivadas del estudio económico realizado y se analizará si resulta o no rentable. The Project {{is intended}} to analyse the future approval of the Royal Decree about energy production in terms of net metering in Spain. The net metering technology {{is based on the}} compensation of energy balances instantly or differes, unleashing <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> possibilities for the consumer to produce his own energy for his particular use. This system is particularly interesting for power generation facilities, especially those renewables, as wind energy, solar-photovoltaic and microgeneration, because for the first time it lets them adjust their production to consumption without physical accumulation. With this system, any facility may produce energy for direct consumption under demand. If the demand of energy is higher than production {{it will be necessary to}} import energy from the electric network; but when the electricity demand is lower than production the energy will be exported to the electric network. The possibility that the net metering Royal Decree may succeed in the upcoming months makes it interesting to present the advantages and disadvantages of its application in a building and the economic benefits for the users under this modality. In this Final Degree Project, we will analyze self consumption through net metering systems and its regulations, as well as the installation of the renewable technologies of wind power with vertical and horizontal axis designs studying its application to residential building and concluding whether it would be profitable or not to carry it out.

The pair confessed to needing the money acquired from Gina's murder to fund a killing spree, which would include purchasing two Ghostface costumes, as well as a voice-changer used by the character in the film. During their trial, psychologist Madeline Levine who studied the effect of violence on children, stated, [...] "There were <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> reasons why they acted out that way.

[...] So with every decision that you make you are removing <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> other possibilities of where that story can go or what that character can do." [...] Given the book's sizable length, Zaillian deleted elements to match Fincher's desired running time. Even so, Zaillan took significant departures from the book. To Zaillian, there was always a [...] "low-grade" [...] anxiety, [...] "but I was never doing anything specifically to please or displease," [...] he continued. [...] "I was simply trying to tell the story the best way I could, and push that out of my mind. I didn't change anything {{just for the sake of}} changing it.

500|$|Waters was an {{aspiring}} filmmaker, intent on making [...] "the trashiest motion pictures in cinema history". Many of his friends, a group {{which came to}} be known as [...] "the Dreamlanders" [...] (and who included Divine, Lochary, Mary Vivian Pearce and Mink Stole), appeared in some of his low-budget productions, filmed on Sunday afternoons. Following the production of his first short film, Hag in a Black Leather Jacket (1964), Waters began production of a second work, Roman Candles (1966). This film was influenced by the pop artist Andy Warhol's Chelsea Girls (1966), and consisted of three 8-millimeter movies played simultaneously side by side. Roman Candles was the first film to star Divine, in this instance in drag as a smoking nun. It featured the Dreamlanders modeling shoplifted clothes and performing various unrelated activities. Being both a short film and of an avant-garde nature, Roman Candles never received widespread distribution, instead holding its premier at the annual Mt. Vernon Flower Mart in Baltimore, which had become popular with [...] "elderly dames, young faggots and hustlers, and of course <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> hippies". Waters went on to screen it at several local venues alongside Kenneth Anger's short film Eaux d'Artifice (1953).|$|E
500|$|James Poniewozik of Time {{took a more}} {{negative}} stance. He wrote that [...] "The Purple Piano Project" [...] "was not a particularly good episode of Glee", one which was hindered by the vast number of central characters, [...] "but it did at least suggest where the third season of the show could find its strong core stories, and also ... the numerous {{ways in which it}} could get sidetracked into tangential ridiculousness." [...] The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff graded the episode [...] "D+". He summarised it as [...] "a handful of okay performances, one or two pretty good lines, and then <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> awful". Rolling Stone Erica Futterman praised the episode's humor and plot development, but commented that it [...] "didn't hit any of the emotional notes Glee is capable of." [...] Robert Canning of IGN rated it an [...] "okay" [...] 6.5 out of 10. He too found [...] "there were still quite a few laughs to be had", but felt the episode suffered from its repetitiveness, as Sue's hatred of the glee club and New Directions' recruitment problems have been thoroughly explored before. The Dallas Morning News Samantha Urban noted that Murphy failed to deliver on his promise to increase Mercedes and Tina's roles, and couldn't accept that Sue would be allowed to promote her congressional campaign on her local news commentary spot, but overall was [...] "pretty impressed" [...] with what she called [...] "a solid episode of Glee that made [...] feel cautiously optimistic about the season ahead."

500|$|Monica {{is portrayed}} by American actress Courteney Cox. Crane and Kauffman had {{originally}} written {{the role of}} Monica for comedian Janeane Garofalo, their first choice, because they were attracted to her [...] "edgier and snarkier" [...] voice. However, Garofalo ultimately turned down the offer. Actress Jami Gertz was also offered the role but declined, while actress Leah Remini auditioned for Monica before ultimately being cast as Carrie Heffernan in the sitcom The King of Queens in 1998; Remini would eventually guest star in an episode of Friends. Before being cast as Monica in Friends, Cox was best known for appearing in singer Bruce Springsteen's [...] "Dancing in the Dark" [...] music video; within the television industry for her recurring role as Lauren Miller, Alex P. Keaton's girlfriend, on the sitcom Family Ties; and Melissa Robinson in the comedy film [...] (1994), opposite Jim Carrey. After guest starring on the sitcom Seinfeld as Meryl, main character Jerry Seinfeld's girlfriend, the producers offered Cox the role of Monica's spoiled best friend Rachel because the actress [...] "had this cheery, upbeat energy", which was significantly different than how they had envisioned Monica at the time. Feeling she was not [...] "quirky" [...] enough to portray Rachel, Cox lobbied in favor of playing Monica instead because she {{was drawn to the}} character's [...] "strong" [...] personality, but the producers feared that she was not [...] "tough" [...] enough for the role, which was offered to actress Jennifer Aniston, alongside whom Cox would eventually co-star. Meanwhile, a close competitor for the role was actress Nancy McKeon; Littlefield recalled having greatly enjoyed both actress' auditions equally, and left the final decision up to Crane and Kauffman. Ultimately, Cox won the role over McKeon because the creators noticed [...] "something fresh" [...] in her audition; Kauffman elaborated that Cox ultimately [...] "brought <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> other colors" [...] to Monica than what they had first envisioned back when they were considering Garofalo for the part.
