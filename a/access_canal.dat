50|$|During {{the period}} of 1960-1980, oil and gas {{exploration}} and development in Louisiana increased dramatically. Numerous large <b>access</b> <b>canals</b> and pipeline canals were dredged through deep swamp areas, across bayous, and across the Atchafalaya River. In some areas of the Basin, there are 2 km or more of <b>access</b> <b>canals</b> to every 1 km of natural bayou. These large channels (30-50 m wide by 2-3 m deep) have fundamentally changed the hydrology of the swamps. Deep swamp areas that were hydraulically isolated from sediment were connected directly to the river and its sediment and suffered rapid filling. The USGS has measured sediment deposition rates of up to 30 cm per year where these channels enter open water, and 4 cm per year on adjacent floodplains. In some places natural bayous have filled in due to flow capture by <b>access</b> <b>canals.</b>|$|R

The approach in this paper involved coupling a sediment transport equation (with the inclusion of lateral inflow parameters), with an estuarine hydro-dynamics equation to generate a generic 3 -dimensional sediment concentration distribution model, using deterministic approach.

40|$|The Niger Delta, {{the largest}} river delta on the African continent, {{is one of}} the most densely {{populated}} river deltas globally and hosts the world's third largest mangrove forest. It is a major biodiversity hot spot of our planet. At the same time the delta is home to Africa's largest oil reserves and responsible for a skyrocketing GDP development of Nigeria since the 1970 s. Nigeria ranks 13 th among all oil producing countries, but oil exploitation also brought with it severe environmental degradation, leading to the delta's nomination for a place on the top 10 list of the “World's Worst Polluted Places Report” in 2013. Despite the outstanding importance of the region for Nigeria, Africa, and the international community most studies published focus mainly on topics of geology, geochemistry, and environmental toxicology. Studies employing earth observation satellite data to assess Niger Delta dynamics are rare. This paper aims at contributing to an overview of Niger Delta geography and environmental threats and challenges, as well as to an understanding of Niger Delta land surface dynamics from 1986 to 2013. Covering the complete delta, we present results of land cover change analyses, results of an assessment of coastline dynamics, as well as the manifestation of oil exploitation activity as expressed via oil <b>access</b> <b>canal</b> dredging and gas flaring, monitored within the 27 year time span investigated...|$|E
