5|$|How {{were such}} effects produced, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>did</b> they look? The {{crocodile}} etc. obviously used the floor trap, {{but was it}} an illusionistically painted figure worked with sticks, or {{a man in a}} crocodile suit? There are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for the Restoration theatre, although some documentation exists for court masques from {{the first half of the}} 17th century, notably the work of Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb. One reason for the lack of information for the public theatres is that stage effects, and particularly machines, were trade secrets. Inventors of theatrical effects took great pains to hold on to their secrets, and the playhouses guarded their machine workings as zealously as a magician guards her or his tricks.|$|E
25|$|One major {{question}} {{in the history of}} Aristotle's works, then, is how were the exoteric writings all lost, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>did</b> the ones we now possess come to us. The story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by Strabo in his Geography and Plutarch in his Parallel Lives. The manuscripts were left from Aristotle to his successor Theophrastus, who in turn willed them to Neleus of Scepsis. Neleus supposedly took the writings from Athens to Scepsis, where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the 1st century BC, when Apellicon of Teos discovered and purchased the manuscripts, bringing them back to Athens. According to the story, Apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts' stay in the basement, introducing a number of errors into the text. When Lucius Cornelius Sulla occupied Athens in 86 BC, he carried off the library of Apellicon to Rome, where they were first published in 60 BC by the grammarian Tyrannion of Amisus and then by the philosopher Andronicus of Rhodes.|$|E

2500|$|In 1979, Colón Sánchez {{expressed}} {{her desire}} to run for a seat as Councilwoman. She {{was supported by the}} Democratic town committee; and endorsed by the mayor, several councilmen, and the Hispanic Democratic Reform Club. Despite all of this support for Colón Sánchez, Councilman Nicholas Carbone, who was a powerful figure in the Democratic political machine, supported Mildred Torres instead. Carbone may have been prejudiced against Colón Sánchez's physical appearance and made her feel that she just wasn't ready. According to a statement made by Carbone when she ran for the school board:“We ran María for the school board and she spoke broken English. She wasn't an attractive woman, she was heavy, so where would you take her? How did you sell her? How did you get people to vote for her? <b>And</b> <b>how</b> <b>did</b> you get over the prejudice that she spoke with a thick accent? So we didn't take her into a lot of neighborhoods... You had to be practical as you were trying to get her on the school board.” ...|$|E

2500|$|As a discipline, {{art history}} is {{distinguished}} from art criticism, which {{is concerned with}} establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement; and art theory or [...] "philosophy of art", which {{is concerned with the}} fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is aesthetics, which includes investigating the enigma of the sublime and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses historical method to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were his or her teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were his or her disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, <b>and</b> <b>How</b> <b>did</b> he or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. Unfortunately the current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this inquiry.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{prior to}} the game's release, PC Gamer writer Stefan Dorresteijn {{contacted}} professional eSports players and hosts for their opinions. Longtime eSports host Paul Chaloner stated that [...] " [...] needs a much better spectator system," [...] going on to elaborate, [...] "Right now, it's incredibly difficult for commentators and viewers to see {{the skills of the}} players: who used their ultimates <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>did</b> they interact? Who is on cooldown and who has changed hero?" [...] Fellow eSports player Seb Barton and Michael Rosen criticized the game's map designs and game modes; Barton remarked that [...] "the game modes are a little hit and miss," [...] adding that [...] "King of the hill [...] is super exciting and fast paced but then you have the payload [...] maps, which are just a snoozefest for everyone involved." [...] Rosen expressed a need for tweaking to the maps used for the control game mode, as they are [...] "just too prone to the snowball effect. The moment the attacking team captures the first control point they don't just have the momentum but also the last advantage for the second and final capture point." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2013, it was {{revealed}} that due to the success of Texas Chainsaw 3D, Millennium Films began planning a sequel film to be called Texas Chainsaw 4 which was expected to begin filming later in 2013 in the state of Louisiana. Millennium Films Chairman Avi Lerner stated that the project was brought to him by Christa Campbell and Lati Grobman and that Millennium had signed on to produce, with Lionsgate distributing the finished product. Executive producer Mark Burg clarified that the sequel was prematurely announced and had not been authorised, [...] "The rights are controlled by Carl [...] and Main Line Pictures, no matter what Millennium says. Millennium simply sold the foreign rights and they will not tell us when a sequel is ready to be made. The script was developed by Carl, myself and writer/director John Luessenhop. Maybe they're looking for something to sell at Berlin, but they have no right to announce this sequel." [...] The idea for a prequel came when Seth M. Sherwood was given the chance to pitch the film to the studio. Dissatisfied with the inconsistencies of the franchise's continuity, he opted to make a Chainsaw film that wasn't just another sequel to the original: [...] "My pitch was always about doing it completely out of left field and making it different. The first thing I said to Millennium was 'I bet I can tell you what everybody else is pitching you and it’s X-Y-Z, but I want to do 1-2-3', and luckily, that's the direction they were interested in going as well." [...] The script was approached as a story of identity, based on the statements given by Tobe Hooper and Gunnar Hansen on how the character Leatherface is entirely devoid of personality beyond the masks he wears and what his family commands him to do. Sherwood chose not to have Leatherface be born as intellectually disabled, finding the story of a functional person that has their mental capabilities reduced to be more fascinating. Producer Les Whedon detailed the reasoning behind accepting Sherwood's pitch: [...] "What interested and enticed us about this production was {{the fact that we were}} presented with an opportunity to re-invent the franchise. It was the opportunity to almost go behind-the-scenes into the beginning of how Leatherface was created. What happened? Who is Leatherface <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>did</b> the whole character come to be?" [...] Despite the film's explanatory premise, co-director Julien Maury found it important to maintain some of the lead character's mystique, referring the project simply as [...] "moments from his young years." ...|$|E
