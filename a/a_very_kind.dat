His position was that the changing needs of an expanding Roman state required a necessary readjustment of the opportunities provided to Plebeians to serve the state, for the good of Rome.|$|E

Whatever issues had troubled Holst were resolved satisfactorily, and Joseph became Imogen's theory teacher: [...] "Theory with Jane is ripping", the young pupil enthused. In the summer term of 1920, with help from Joseph, Imogen devised and composed a [...] "Dance of Nymphs and Shepherds" [...] which was performed at the school on 9 July. At the beginning of 1921 Imogen started at SPGS; before becoming a boarder at Bute House (one of the school's residences for pupils), she stayed in the Joseph family home.|$|E

Wheeler became very fond of his students, with one of them, B. B. Lal, later commenting that [...] "behind the gruff exterior, Sir Mortimer had <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>kind</b> and sympathetic heart". Throughout his period in India, his students {{were some of the}} only individuals to whom Wheeler warmed; more widely, he was annoyed by what he saw as the idleness, incompetence and corruption of Indian society. Initially focusing on the northwest of the subcontinent, Wheeler was particularly fascinated by the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilization. On his initial inspection of the Indus Valley sites of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, he organised a very brief excavation which revealed fortifications around both settlements. He later led a more detailed excavation at Harappa, where he exposed further fortifications and established a stratigraphy for the settlement.|$|E

It was based on how she felt, her mood, and also her listening to the demos that writers would give us." [...] With Swivel, she experimented with horns, drums, guitars and percussion instruments. Mostly inspired by the Fela! sessions, Swivel began to formulate beats using their own recordings and those from Fela! The project was moved to KMA Studios for {{a week and a half}} because Roc the Mic was not large enough. There they began recording [...] "I Care", [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] and [...] "Rather Die Young", and completed [...] "Party". They recorded the songs [...] "Schoolin' Life", [...] "1+1" [...] and [...] "Start Over" [...] at Jungle City Studios in New York.|$|E
500|$|Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews: The ship's builder, Andrews {{is portrayed}} as <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>kind</b> and {{pleasant}} man who is modest about his grand achievement. After the collision, he tries to convince the others, particularly Ismay, {{that it is a}} [...] "mathematical certainty" [...] that the ship will sink. He is depicted during the sinking of the ship as standing next to the clock in the first-class smoking room, lamenting his failure to build a strong and safe ship. Although this {{has become one of the}} most famous legends of the sinking of the Titanic, this story, which was published in a 1912 book (Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder) and therefore perpetuated, came from John Stewart, a steward on the ship who in fact left the ship in boat n. 15 at approximately 1:40a.m. There were testimonies of sightings of Andrews after that moment. It appears that Andrews stayed in the smoking room for some time to gather his thoughts, then he continued assisting with the evacuation. Another reported sighting was of Andrews frantically throwing deck chairs into the ocean for passengers to use as floating devices. Andrews was last seen leaving the ship at the last moment.|$|E

Makoto has a mischievous side and constantly plays pranks on Yuichi. She has an affinity towards the spring and once wished that it would stay spring forever.Translated quote: [...] "If only spring would come and stay forever." [...] Yuichi coincidentally runs into Shiori Misaka, another heroine and first-year high school student suffering from an unexplained illness since birth. Her affliction has caused her to become very physically weak, and she is almost always absent from school because of it. She tries to be strong in the face of her condition, and gets along well with others, even though she does not know very many people her age due to her condition. The fifth and final heroine in Kanon is Mai Kawasumi, a third-year student of the same high school that Yuichi attends. She has a cold attitude towards almost everyone, but despite this, she is actually <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>kind</b> and caring person; she [...] "punishes" [...] someone who makes a playful joke about her by giving them a light karate chop to the head.|$|E

About his role in Thor he stated, [...] "Agent Coulson was one of the guys who wasn't really in the comic books, and he [...] <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>kind</b> of small role in Iron Man. And I was just very lucky that they chose to expand that character and [...] to put him more into the universe of it." [...] After signing on to appear as Clint Barton / Hawkeye in The Avengers, Jeremy Renner made a cameo appearance as the character during a scene in Thor. Branagh said that they [...] "were always going to have a guy in a basket above the action where Thor breaks in the S.H.I.E.L.D. camp", and that he was thrilled when the producers told him they wanted to use Renner's Hawkeye for that role. The film ends with a post-credits scene featuring Loki, watching as Erik Selvig and Nick Fury discuss the Tesseract. The scene was directed by Joss Whedon, who directed The Avengers. Stellan Skarsgård, who played Selvig, said the scene was not included when he first read the screenplay for Thor, and that he was sent pages for the scene after agreeing to appear in The Avengers.|$|E
