2500|$|The second seizure {{occurred}} 6 {{months later}} on a ferryboat trip: “He {{told me that}} he felt sick, and {{on his way to the}} toilet his eyes and head turned to the right <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> out of context, and then he was sick. I thought he was having another fit. He was still able to converse with me in and out of sleep. He did not become unconscious, but he was continuously sick for several hours. By the time we arrived in a hospital 3 hours later, he was improving; he just seemed tired. The doctors told us that this was due to dehydration, for which treatment was provided. He was normal the next morning”.|$|E
2500|$|John Pizer or Piser (c. 1850–1897) was a Polish Jew {{who worked}} as a bootmaker in Whitechapel. In {{the early days of the}} Whitechapel murders, many locals {{suspected}} that [...] "Leather Apron" [...] was the killer, which was picked up by the press, and Pizer was known as [...] "Leather Apron". He had a prior conviction for a stabbing offence, and Police Sergeant William Thicke apparently believed that he had committed a string of minor assaults on prostitutes. After the murders of Mary Ann Nichols and Annie Chapman in late August and early September 1888 respectively, Thicke arrested Pizer on 10 September, even though the investigating inspector reported that [...] "there is no evidence whatsoever against him". He was cleared of suspicion when it turned out that he had alibis for two of the murders. He was staying with relatives at the time of one of the canonical murders, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> with a police officer while watching a spectacular fire on the London Docks at the time of another. Pizer and Thicke had known each other for years, and Pizer implied that his arrest was based on animosity rather than evidence. Pizer successfully obtained monetary compensation from at least one newspaper that had named him as the murderer. Thicke himself was accused of being the Ripper by H. T. Haslewood of Tottenham in a letter to the Home Office dated 10 September 1889; the presumably malicious accusation was dismissed as without foundation.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{a terrible}} little fool you are! That fellow's a millionaire--he's a nephew of old Van Skittles himself. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> on the level, too. Have you gone crazy, Nance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's at the telephone," [...] she said. [...] "The Admiralty rang {{up about}} {{something}} <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> to them. I'll tell him, if you like, {{when he comes}} up." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{walked on}} towards the deserted tank <b>and</b> now <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> aloud.|$|R
60|$|Isobel <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> still <b>talking</b> together. Arthur's {{voice was}} a little raised--then it {{suddenly}} dropped.|$|R
6000|$|Harry was {{extremely}} sorry that Mr. Matthews was so incensed against him, especially {{as he knew}} there was no cause for it, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about it to Kate one day, when she exclaimed: ...|$|E
60|$|Sproatly, {{who made}} no answer, turned away, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> to Agatha when, {{half an hour}} later, a waggon drew up outside the door. In another minute or two he leaned forward in amused {{expectation}} as Sally walked into the room.|$|E
60|$|So felt, at least, {{two friends}} who went down, {{just one week}} before Christmas-day, to Whitbury, in Berkshire. Two years ago had come to one of them, as to {{thousands}} more, the crisis of his life; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> of it with his companion; and was on his way, too, to learn more of that story, which this book contains, and {{in which he had}} borne his part.|$|E
6000|$|MISS REED: [...] "Eavesdropping is {{listening}} through a key-hole, or around a corner. This is very different. Besides, it's Oliver, <b>and</b> <b>he's</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> about ME. Hark!" [...] She clutches her friend's hand, {{where they have}} crouched upon the floor together, and pulls her forward to the register. [...] "Oh, dear, how hot it is! I wish they would cut off the heat down below." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> still <b>talking</b> European {{politics}} {{just as he}} used to in {{the days}} of our earlier acquaintance.|$|R
5000|$|Preterite: [...] "Heute früh kam mein Freund." [...] (my friend {{came early}} in the morning, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> being <b>talked</b> about {{strictly}} in the past) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite right. Well done in you," [...] responded Warwick. [...] "The Duke of York {{is the man}} to hold by. We have an {{exchange}} for you, a daughter for a son," [...] and he was leading the way towards Grisell, who had just dismounted from her pony, and stood by it, trembling a little, and bending for her father's blessing. It was not more than a crossing of her, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> all the time.|$|E
60|$|Cynthia and {{her father}} {{had gone back to}} their own house as soon as Jeff returned, and though the girl came home with Mrs. Durgin after the funeral, and helped her in their common duties through the {{afternoon}} and evening, Westover saw her taking her way down the hill with her brother when the long day's work was over. Jeff saw her too; he was sitting with Westover at the office door smoking, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> of the Whitwells.|$|E
60|$|He became silent. I {{looked at}} him in astonishment. If ever I saw a man hopelessly hard-up it was the man in front of me. He was ragged and he was dirty, unshaven and unkempt; he looked as though he had been left in a dust-bin for a week. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> to me of the irksome worries of a large business. I almost laughed outright. Either he was mad or playing a sorry jest on his own poverty.|$|E
60|$|Jefferson saw and {{his eyes}} twinkled. Kit <b>was</b> embarrassed, because <b>he</b> had remembered the others <b>and</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> like a prig. All the same, the young fellow was staunch.|$|R
6000|$|I am at Maud Gonne's hotel, and an Italian sympathiser Cipriani, {{the friend}} of Garibaldi, is there, and though {{an old man}} now, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the handsomest man I have ever seen. I am telling a ghost story in English {{at one end of}} the room, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> {{politics}} in French at the other. Somebody says, [...] "Yeats believes in ghosts," [...] and Cipriani interrupts for a moment his impassioned declamation to say in English, and with a magnificent movement and intonation, [...] "As for me, I believe in nothing but cannon." ...|$|R
50|$|The band {{started to}} hit it big fairly quickly. Their debut album Das ist Walter {{appeared}} in June 1984 and it was soon apparent that their popularity would soon grow beyond the city of Sarajevo. A national tour followed, which brought Nele more attention. They played a sold-out show (6,000 capacity) at Hala sportova in Belgrade on November 4, 1984. At this time Nele was also starring on the Top lista nadrealista sketch comedy TV show, soon making him a celebrity. His face started popping up on fold-out posters in entertainment magazines <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talked</b> about by the media.|$|R
60|$|When I {{came to the}} {{headquarters}} I was shown straight into the Emperor's room. He was drinking coffee at a writing-table, with a big plan drawn out on paper in front of him. Berthier and Macdonald were leaning, one over each shoulder, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> so quickly that I don't believe that either of them could catch a half {{of what he was}} saying. But when his eyes fell upon me he dropped the pen on to the chart, and he sprang up with a look in his pale face which struck me cold.|$|E
60|$|The {{three had}} {{stopped by a}} bench under a tree. The young man, who wore claret silk and a sword, {{had one of those}} thin faces of dirty {{complexion}} which show the ravages of dissipation, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> with a rapidity and vehemence of which only a Latin tongue will admit. We could see, likewise, that the girl was answering with spirit,--indeed, I should write a stronger word than spirit,--while the elderly gentleman, who had a good-humored, fleshy face and figure, was plainly doing his best to calm them both. People who were passing stared curiously at the three.|$|E
6000|$|... "He didn't. He argued. And {{one thing}} led to another until, by easy stages, they had arrived at the point where she was saying that she didn't know if he was aware of it, but if he didn't knock off starchy foods and do {{exercises}} every morning, he would be getting as fat as a pig, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about this modern habit of girls putting make-up on their faces, of which he had always disapproved. This continued for a while, and then there was a loud pop and the air was full of mangled fragments of their engagement. I'm distracted about it. Thank goodness you've come, Bertie." ...|$|E
5000|$|In April 2011, Sheen {{mentioned}} {{during a}} radio interview after his tours stop in Boston that CBS <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> {{about a possible}} return to the show. Lorre announced that same month that he had developed an idea for Two and a Half Men to be redone that would exclude Sheen and have Cryer in a key role alongside a new character. On May 13, CBS announced Ashton Kutcher would join the cast. Kutcher was quoted as saying, [...] "I cant replace Charlie Sheen but Im going to work my ass off to entertain {{the hell out of}} people!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, Bill, it is hard," [...] Ned said, [...] "and I am not {{surprised}} that {{you feel that you}} cannot stand it; but it won't be for long now. Easter will be here in a fortnight, and then I shall see Mr. Simmonds and get him to apply at once. I met him in the street only last week, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about it then. He thinks that it will not be long after he sends in an application before I get my commission. He says he has got interest in London at the Horse Guards, and will get the application of the lord lieutenant backed up there; so I hope that {{in a couple of months}} at latest it will all be settled." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{this narrow}} passage stands a man {{looking through the}} palisades into the burying place, and {{as many people as}} the narrowness of the place would admit to stop without {{hindering}} the passage of others; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> mighty eagerly to them, and pointing, now to one place, then to another, and affirming that he saw a ghost walking upon such a gravestone there. He described the shape, the posture, and the movement of it so exactly, that it was the greatest amazement to him in the world that everybody did not see it as well as he. On a sudden he would cry, [...] "There it is! Now it comes this way!" [...] then, [...] "'Tis turned back!" [...] till at length he persuaded the people into so firm a belief of it, that one fancied he saw it; and thus he came every day, making a strange hubbub, considering it was so narrow a passage, till Bishopsgate clock struck eleven; and then the ghost would seem to start, and, as if he were called away, disappeared on a sudden.|$|E
60|$|And now my {{advocate}} {{began asking}} questions--vague, useless questions--in a slow, hesitating fashion which set Toussac grumbling. This cross-examination {{appeared to me}} to be a useless farce; and yet there was a certain eagerness and intensity in my questioner's manner which gave me the assurance that he had some end in view. Was it merely that he wished to gain time? Time for what? And then, suddenly, with that quick perception which comes upon those whose nerves are strained by an extremity of danger, I became convinced that he really was awaiting something--that he was tense with expectation. I read it upon his drawn face, upon his sidelong head with his ear scooped into his hand, above all in his twitching, restless eyes. He expected an interruption, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking,</b> talking, talking, in order to gain time for it. I was as sure of it as if he had whispered his secret in my ear, and down in my numb, cold heart a warm little spring of hope began to bubble and run.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed," [...] {{observed}} Colonel Everard, [...] "he looks singularly wan--his features seem writhen as by a palsy stroke; <b>and</b> though <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> so fast {{while we}} came along, he hath not {{opened his mouth}} since {{we came to the}} light." ...|$|R
50|$|One {{night in}} Metropolis, the elderly night {{watchman}} from the Metropolis Munitions Works is {{found dead in}} a swamp. When news of the incident reaches the city the next morning, Lois Lane and Clark Kent both decide to grab the story for themselves. Clark talks to Lois, not realizing she has gone <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> to a bus driver named Louis, who gets angry at what <b>he</b> thinks <b>was</b> a mistake about his name. As Lois goes undercover at the plant after meeting with the plant supervisor in the Personnel Building, she meets the new night guard, a kindly, white-haired, old man leaving the Personnel MGR. office.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--that Sunday Mr. Bailey preached. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> so long-winded, I got awful tired, <b>and,</b> anyway, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> {{about things}} I couldn't understand, so I played tit-tat-x {{with one of}} the Markdale boys.

60|$|In {{this narrow}} passage stands a man looking through between the palisadoes into the burying-place, {{and as many}} people as the narrowness of the passage would admit to stop, without {{hindering}} the passage of others, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> mightily eagerly to them, and pointing now to one place, then to another, and affirming that he saw a ghost walking upon such a gravestone there.

6000|$|Staniford {{smiled at}} the {{distress}} in which Dunham went his way. He understood very well {{that it was not}} vanity, but the liveliness of a sensitive conscience, that had made Dunham search his conduct for the offense against the young girl's peace of heart which he believed he had committed, and it was the more amusing because he was so guiltless of harm. Staniford knew who was to blame for the headache and the blush. He knew that Dunham had never gone so far; that his chivalrous pleasure in her society might continue for years free from flirtation. But in spite of this conviction a little poignant doubt made itself felt, and suddenly became his whole consciousness. [...] "Confound him!" [...] he mused. [...] "I wonder if she really could care anything for him!" [...] He shut his book, and rose to his feet with such a burning in his heart that he could not have believed himself capable of the greater rage he felt at what he just then saw. It was Lydia and Hicks seated together in the place where he had sat with her. She leaned with one arm upon the rail, in an attitude that brought all her slim young grace into evidence. She seemed on very good terms with him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> and making her laugh as Staniford had never heard her laugh before--so freely, so heartily.|$|E
6000|$|One of {{the young}} {{officers}} with Suetonius had taken a great fancy to Beric, and frequently invited him to spend the evening with him at their halting places. When they approached Massilia he said, [...] "I have some relations in the city, and I will obtain leave for you {{to stay with me}} at their house while we remain in the town, which may be for some little time, as we must wait for shipping. My uncle is a magistrate, and a very learned man. He is engaged in writing a book upon the religions of the world, and he seldom remains long at any post. He has very powerful friends in Rome, and so is able to get transferred from one post to another. He has been in almost every province of the empire in order to learn from the people themselves their religions and beliefs. I stayed with him for a month here two years since on my way to Britain, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> of getting himself transferred there, after he had been among the Gauls for a year or two; but his wife was averse to the idea, protesting that she had been dragged nearly all over the world by him, and was determined not to go to its furthest boundaries. But I should think that after {{the events of the last}} year he has given up that idea. I know it will give him the greatest possible pleasure to converse with one who can tell him all about the religions and customs of the Britons in his own language." ...|$|E
