The population of Ireland grew to over eight million people prior to the Irish Famine (or Great Famine) of 1845 - 47. The Irish people depended on the potato crop for their sustenance. Disaster struck in August 1845, when a killer fungus (later diagnosed as Phytophthora infestans) started to destroy the potato crop. When widespread famine struck, about a million people died and a further million left the country. People died in the fields from starvation and disease. The catastrophe was particularly bad in County Mayo, where nearly ninety per cent of the population depended on the potato as their staple food.

Given that a hotel room is an almost air-tight setting and not very spacious, knowledge about the concentrations of PM 2. 5 created by cigarette smoking and the subsequent mitigation measures taken appears {{to be important in}} hotel management practice. Thus, field measurements were undertaken in a hotel room to ascertain the cigarette burning and smoking induced pollutant concentrations during the following ON and OFF conditions: with ventilation, with a window open, and using a specific air purifier designed to mitigate the effects of cigarette smoking. The investigation found that cigarette burning and smoking induced PM 2. 5 concentrations may reach 586 mu g/m(3) and 1368 mu g/m(3) on average when ventilation is OFF, respectively. The operation of ventilation may reduce the concentration to about 100 mu g/m(3). The effectiveness of opening a window as an <b>alleviating</b> <b>measure</b> greatly depends on outdoor PM 2. 5 concentrations; the observed threshold reference is 100 mu g/m(3).

40|$|This study {{examined}} and analysed human trafficking {{as a security}} issue using South Africa and Mozambique as country case studies. Information gathered through documentary analysis methodology is relied upon to develop a conceptual framework of human trafficking and security. The link between trafficking and security is evaluated based on the conceptualisation of trafficking in the Palermo Protocol {{as well as the}} criteria for declaring social phenomena security threats, as articulated by the UN and several scholars. Through global and national overviews of human trafficking, its patterns, extent and enabling conditions are identified and analysed. In South Africa and Mozambique, human trafficking has domestic and international dimensions and is facilitated by several factors. However, factors facilitating domestic trafficking do not necessarily facilitate international trafficking in South Africa. The opposite is however, the case in the Mozambican context. An analysis of global, regional, and national counter trafficking measures, shows that the national security implications of human trafficking are not explicitly addressed. Trafficking involves national border violations; organised crime; corruption, and physical violence which have implications for security at all levels. Consequently, recommendations are made for the explicit securitisation of trafficking as well as the demonstration of sufficient political will to combat it. Regional and international co-operation is also considered necessary to combat trafficking, as well as prosecution of offenders and the introduction of poverty <b>alleviating</b> <b>measures.</b> Thesis (DPhil) [...] University of Pretoria, 2015. tm 2015 Political SciencesDPhilUnrestricte...|$|E
40|$|Framework Within the {{framework}} of the 'Room for the River' policy in the Netherlands several river bypasses are studied. One of these projects is the Noordwaard, which is a special project, because a large polder (about 20 km 2) will change into a tidal influenced area. The primary water defences in the North of the polder (Nieuwe Merwede) are to be lowered to a treshold. The water defences in the South (Biesbosch) will even be removed completely. In this way water can be bypassed from the Nieuwe Merwede to the Biesbosch, this will result in a substantial decrease of normative water levels on the Nieuwe Merwede. The hydraulic and morphologic consequences for the Noordwaard will however be severe. Focus In this thesis the relation between creek design and morphology of the 'new' Noordwaard is studied. This is achieved by researching the morphologic and hydraulic consequences of the 'new' Noordwaard. After which the (possibly alleviating) morphological effects of a couple of design features are studied. Modelling In order to do this several 1 D models are used. Model runs were performed with a 'small' model, for the Biesbosch, and with a 'large' model, including the whole of the Dutch delta basin (Noordelijk deltabekken). For which two types of boundary conditions were applied: - Historical 1998 (survey data for a representative year); - Probabilistic (discharge fractions of the Rhine). Morphology From the results of both calculations a couple of conclusions could be drawn. The major conclusion {{is that there will be}} predominantly moderate sedimentation, up to 6 mm/year for the creeks and up to 2 mm/year for the floodplains. Some aspects with a strong effect on morphology are: - Yearly river discharge variations; - The height of the threshold (small dyke) at the Nieuwe Merwede; - Local geometry; It also showed that the historical boundary conditions offer a more realistic approach to the morphology of estuarine river bypasses, then the probabilistic boundary conditions. The probabilistic approach was unable to deal with some essential aspects for modelling estuarine river bypasses, like time dependent processes (i. e. flood waves) and realistic sea water levels. <b>Alleviating</b> <b>measures</b> A detailed analysis on possible measures to reduce the sedimentation in the Noordwaard, showed that a simple meandering creek system best suites the morphological demands. Other alternatives, like divers under the threshold, even increased the sedimentation in the polder.

40|$|Aim: Forest height, an {{important}} biophysical property, underlies {{the distribution of}} carbon stocks across scales. Because in situ observations are labour intensive and thus impractical for large-scale mapping and monitoring of forest heights, most previous studies adopted statistical approaches to help <b>alleviate</b> <b>measured</b> data discontinuity in space and time. Here, we document an improved modelling approach which links metabolic scaling theory and the water–energy balance equation with actual observations {{in order to produce}} large-scale patterns of forest heights. Methods: Our model, called allometric scaling and resource limitations (ASRL), accounts for the size-dependent metabolism of trees whose maximum growth is constrained by local resource availability. Geospatial predictors used in the model are altitude and monthly precipitation, solar radiation, temperature, vapour pressure and wind speed. Disturbance history (i. e. stand age) is also incorporated to estimate contemporary forest heights. Results: This study provides a baseline map (c. 2005; 1 -km^ 2 grids) of forest heights over the contiguous United States. The Pacific Northwest/California is predicted as the most favourable region for hosting large trees (c. 100 m) because of sufficient annual precipitation (> 1400 mm), moderate solar radiation (c. 330 W m^(− 2)) and temperature (c. 14 °C). Our results at sub-regional level are generally in good and statistically significant (P-value[*]<[*] 0. 001) agreement with independent reference datasets: field measurements [mean absolute error (MAE) [*]=[*] 4. 0 m], airborne/spaceborne lidar (MAE[*]=[*] 7. 0 m) and an existing global forest height product (MAE[*]=[*] 4. 9 m). Model uncertainties at county level are also discussed in this study. Main conclusions: We improved the metabolic scaling theory to address variations in vertical forest structure due to ecoregion and plant functional type. A clear mechanistic understanding embedded within the model allowed synergistic combinations between actual observations and multiple geopredictors in forest height mapping. This approach shows potential for prognostic applications, unlike previous statistical approaches...|$|R

The found terrain are very diversified and several occasions the vegetal covering becomes difficult in reason of the physical-chemical characteristics for germination to be inadequate. In areas of high risk to the occupation with stability problems, commonly they use covering with projected concrete for containment of hillsides, that parallelly causes strong environmental and visual impact in the intervention area, and furthermore, possibly, not consisting insolutions duly adequate or definitive for these situations.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{aimed to develop}} a Monash-style medium-scale dynamic computable general {{equilibrium}} (CGE) model for Tourism of Thailand as the major contribution. The model {{is designed to be}} capable of analyzing not only the economic policies but also historical simulation and forecasting simulation. The comparative static version of the ‘THORANI’ model is first developed and later on improved it into the dynamic version of the ‘TRAVELTHAI’ model that comprises dynamic capability. TRAVELTHAI’s modeling structure is based upon the MyAGE and McHuge, which are successors of MONASH, the dynamic CGE model of the Australian economy (Dixon and Rimmer 2002) that contains the dynamic mechanism features. The TRAVELTHAI model captures the structure of the Thai economy using the coefficients attributing from the Thai Tourism Satellite Accounts (TSAs) which is the main distinction from the other kinds of CGE models, for which normally use the Input Output Tables, the adoption of proper substitution elasticities as the key parameters, and the portrayal of specific features regarding tourism which are also relevant to the Thai economy. The model contains a detailed disaggregation of industries, especially those related to Tourism, factors of production, technologies and preferences, taxes and margins, a comprehensive illustration of government accounts, balance of payment accounts, and net foreign liabilities. The dynamic mechanisms also include the links between stock and flow variables for physical capital accumulation, for debt and savings, and for wage-employment adjustment. TRAVELTHAI possesses 3 types of tourism demands: Inbound, Domestic, and Outbound tourism. Although the thesis thematically focuses on inbound tourism or travel receipts in the Service accounts of the Balance of Payments, this gives the power to further study in terms of revenue and expenditure of the balance of travel. The baseline historical simulation of the Thai economy over the period 2001 - 2011 and baseline forecast for 2012 - 2020 are performed. The decade has shown an interesting rapid growth with the contribution of tourism growth of seven percent per annum on the average despite adverse tourism setbacks ranging from epidemic flu, tsunami, the recent political turmoil and the flood. Six major simulations with TRAVELTHAI have been conducted. The first is the historical simulation, for which observed changes in economic variables e. g. changes in GDP, outputs of industries, factors of production, household consumption or international trade become the exogenous shocks for the model, and changes in technologies and preferences are solved endogenously. This is aimed to develop the baseline for the Thai economy. Three projections to the year 2020 of the forecasting simulation have been carried out, bases on the evidence of the decade average, the first half and {{the second half of the}} previous decade. This time, the economic performance is evaluated from the structural changes in technologies and preferences obtained earlier and projects to the future to develop the baseline forecasts of these three projections. The fifth and the sixth are major simulations regarding the thesis objectives. They are those with external shocks and policy simulations. Simulation for external shocks of tourism setback in term of recent major flood is delivered. Behavioral effects of demand side and resource losses effect of supply side shocks are then applied in five sub-total shocks. Two behavioral effects are inbound tourism shift and the cut in the number of domestic tourists. Other three resources losses shocks are related to the losses or damages of factors of production: labor, capital, and land. The sixth simulation is the tourism-related fiscal policy on the tax cut for inbound tourism. The comparison between tax cut and without tax cut scenarios is also presented. This is aimed to pursue for alleviating measure to soothe the effect of tourism setback. Apart from historical and forecasting simulations which are aimed to create the benchmark as the baseline forecasts, the results from the setback simulation show that in the short run the flood causes the declines of real GDP and its compositions relative to the baseline. Trade balance deteriorates. Inbound tourism also decreases but not as much as outbound and domestic tourism. Domestic tourism revenue, thus, drops. Travel receipts accordingly weaken, but less than travel expenses worsen, which improves travel balance. For the supply side, the labors migrate to non-tourism industries from the tourism-related industries. Output productions are all reduced, with non-tourism industries most worsening. The flood damages the economy. In all, resource losses effects show domination over other effects. The after effect forecast growths to the year 2020 show that both behavioral and resource-loss effects of flooding reduce real GDP and its components overtime. Labors migrate to the non-tourism industries from direct tourism industries and tourism-connected industries. Direct tourism industries suffer more than tourism-connected industries in terms of labor reduction and the releases of labor rising through the period. All sectors produce less output, accordingly. Over-time slight deterioration in terms of trade subsequently improves balance of travel. Simulation on a tax cut as an incentive for the inbound tourist shows a plus to the falling real GDP relative to the baseline. Tax cut creates a larger impact on inbound tourism. Travel receipts increase accordingly, comparing to the decrease in the scenario without any tax cut. Tax cut improves balance of travel towards a surplus comparing to the lower gain of that without the tax cut. It also generates more outputs in the direct tourism industries as expected, though not enough to make a positive outcome for the total but the fall in the reduction of output production is a better off. This is in line with the greater amount of labor hired in the sector. For other two industries, they are worse off as their own labors migrate to the direct tourism industries. Their productions follow the falls in their sectoral employment. For the after effect tax cut forecast growth to 2020, only real inbound tourism and tourism receipts have considerable changes comparing to that without tax cut. For real inbound tourism, the after-flood growth is negative for without tax cut scenario in the short run and recover to be positive in the long run. With the tax cut, the deviation from base case forecast is positive and growing further in the long run. Tourism receipts show similar pattern. Nonetheless, the effect on the deviation over real GDP is very tiny and it reveals the same trend for both tax cut and without tax cut. Outputs and employments of direct tourism industries with tax cut decline less than that of without tax cut, though with similar declining trend. For tourism-connected industries, the reductions are about the same with the similar trend. For non-tourism industries, there are further output and employment reductions comparing to the without tax cut scenario. Tax cut incentive could be one of <b>alleviating</b> <b>measures</b> to soothe the tourism setback. Political-wise, a mix of incentives could be further pursued for what-if analyses to examine all inclusive effects other than tourism-focused. Such policy planning is helpful to understand trade-offs among economic agents to minimize incurring costs...|$|E
40|$|Since the mid- 1980 s many {{authors have}} {{investigated}} the influence of information technology (IT) on productivity. Until recently {{there has been no}} clear evidence that productivity increases as a result of IT spending. This productivity paradox is partly due to the difficulty in correctly identifying outputs, particularly in the service sector such as the trucking industry. Products are often differentiated by quality attributes of the service provided, rather than merely the physical content of the good delivered by motor carriers. A carrier's primary marketing objective, e. g. on-time-performance vs. lowest rate carrier, are precisely what differentiates a trucking firm's service. This paper uses cross-sectional data to show that the use of increasingly sophisticated IT by trucking firms varies depending upon marketing objectives. Our empirical results imply that in order to measure the impact of IT on productivity it is crucial to account for how the firm differentiates its product. We conclude that the productivity paradox can be <b>alleviated</b> if <b>measures</b> of output incorporate firms' marketing objectives. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{collection}} of papers records {{a series of}} studies, carried out {{over a period of}} some 50 years, on two aspects of river pollution control - the prevention of pollution by sewage biological filtration and the monitoring of river pollution by biological surveillance. The earlier studies were carried out to develop methods of controlling flies which bred in the filters and caused serious nuisance and possible public health hazard, when they dispersed to surrounding villages. Although the application of insecticides proved effective as an <b>alleviate</b> <b>measure,</b> because it resulted in only a temporary disturbance of the ecological balance, it was considered ecologically unsound as a long-term solution. Subsequent investigations showed that the fly populations in filters were largely determined by the amount of food available to the grazing larval stage in the form of filter film. It was also established that the winter deterioration in filter performance was due to the excessive accumulation of film. Subsequent investigations were therefore carried out to determine the factors responsible for the accumulation of film in different types of filter. Methods of filtration which were considered to control film accumulation by increasing the flushing action of the sewage, were found to control fungal film by creating nutrient limiting conditions. In some filters increasing the hydraulic flushing reduced the grazing fauna population in the surface layers and resulted in an increase in film. The results of these investigations were successfully applied in modifying filters and in the design of a Double Filtration process. These studies on biological filters lead to the conclusion that they should be designed and operated as ecological systems and not merely as hydraulic ones. Studies on the effects of sewage effluents on Birmingham streams confirmed the findings of earlier workers justifying their claim for using biological methods for detecting and assessing river pollution. Further ecological studies showed the sensitivity of benthic riffle communities to organic pollution. Using experimental channels and laboratory studies the different environmental conditions associated with organic pollution were investigated. The degree and duration of the oxygen depletion during the dark hours were found to be a critical factor. The relative tolerance of different taxa to other pollutants, such as ammonia, differed. Although colonisation samplers proved of value in sampling difficult sites, the invertebrate data generated were not suitable for processing as any of the commonly used biotic indexes. Several of the papers, which were written by request for presentation at conferences etc., presented the biological viewpoint on river pollution and water quality issues at the time and advocated the use of biological methods.

This- the Predictive Toxicology Evaluation (or PTE) Challenge- was seen to provide AI programs with an opportunity to participate in an enterprise of scientific merit, and a yardstick for comparison against strong competition. Here we provide an assessment of the machine learning (ML) submissions made. Models submitted are assessed on: (1) their accuracy, in comparison to models developed with expert collaboration; and (2) their explanatory value for toxicology. The principal findings were: (a) using structural information available from a standard modelling package, layman-devised features, and outcomes of established biological tests, results from MLderived models were at least as good as those with expert-derived techniques. This was surprising; (b) the combined use of structural and biological features by ML-derived models was unusual, and suggested new avenues for toxicology modelling.

The combined <b>measure</b> <b>alleviates</b> ambiguous results and aids in the automatic comparison of fuzzy sets. The properties of the combined measure are given, and demonstrations are presented with discussions on the advantages over using a single measure.

40|$|Abstract Background Overall {{reproductive}} performance of dairy herds is monitored by various indicators. Most {{of them do}} not consider all eligible animals and do not consider different management strategies at farm level. This problem can be <b>alleviated</b> by <b>measuring</b> the proportion of pregnant cows by specific intervals after their calving date or after a fixed time period, such as the voluntary waiting period. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate two {{reproductive performance}} indicators that consider the voluntary waiting period at the herd. The two indicators were: percentage of pregnant cows in the herd after the voluntary waiting period plus 30 days (PV 30) and percentage of inseminated cows in the herd after the voluntary waiting period plus 30 days (IV 30). We wanted to assess how PV 30 and IV 30 perform in a simulation of herds with different reproductive management and physiology and to compare them to indicators of reproductive performance that do not consider the herd voluntary waiting period. Methods To evaluate the reproductive indicators we used the SimHerd-program, a stochastic simulation model, and 18 scenarios were simulated. The scenarios were designed by altering the reproductive management efficiency and the status of reproductive physiology of the herd. Logistic regression models, together with receiver operating characteristics (ROC), were used to examine how well the reproductive performance indicators could discriminate between herds of different levels of reproductive management efficiency or reproductive physiology. Results The logistic regression models with the ROC analysis showed that IV 30 was the indicator that best discriminated between different levels of management efficiency followed by PV 30, calving interval, 200 -days not-in calf-rate (NotIC 200), in calf rate at 100 -days (IC 100) and a fertility index. For reproductive physiology the ROC analysis showed that the fertility index was the indicator that best discriminated between different levels, followed by PV 30, NotIC 200, IC 100 and the calving interval. IV 30 could not discriminate between the two levels. Conclusion PV 30 is the single best performance indicator for estimating the level of both herd management efficiency and reproductive physiology followed by NotIC 200 and IC 100. This indicates that PV 30 could be a potential candidate for inclusion in dairy herd improvement schemes. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{develop an}} account for careers within the Greek {{academic}} system. Historical, cultural and geographical {{features of the}} country have created a rather unique context that has apparently shaped the way academic careers evolve. Design/methodology/approach: The primary methods of data collection were retrospective participant observation and discussions in interview form with individuals who have had various types of experience with the Greek Higher Education system. Findings: The major factor that shapes careers in Greek academia is social capital or Know-whom that operates within a broader cultural environment where institutional collectivism is extremely low, the in-group- out-group distinction is a major element, and political ideology {{plays an important role}} in everyday affairs. As a result academic careers in Greece are almost exclusively determined by membership, a priory or earned, to an “in-group ” that is linked via blood, family friendship, business and political party ties. This “in-group ” uses its social capital to control academic careers across all stages for the benefit of its members and at the expense of “outsiders”. Research limitations/implications: There are method limitations, but relevant concerns were largely <b>alleviated</b> by precautionary <b>measures</b> and the way data were utilized. Ethnography may be the most appropriate method to disentangle the way networks and social capital impact careers. Practical implications: Achieving substantive change, such as increasing meritocracy, within a particular sector may not be possible without consideration of the broader cultural context that encapsulates it. ha l-...|$|R
40|$|Ice {{and snow}} cause {{difficulties}} for road users in winter. These difficulties consist mainly of reduced accessibility and higher risks {{of various kinds}} of road accidents, which the road administrations endeavour to <b>alleviate</b> by maintenance <b>measures</b> of various kinds. Snow clearance and skid prevention treatment, such as salting of carriageways, are the two predominant kinds of maintenance measure that are taken. In this way a benefits are created for road users, {{but at the same}} time also a lot of inconvenience and costs. The maintenance costs of the road administration for these measures are directly influenced by the maintenance action taken. At the same time, there is reason to believe that road users and third parties also incur costs of various types. Different strategies for winter road maintenance may be expected to give rise to different outcomes as regards the costs and benefits of the kinds referred to above. It can thus be expected that the total costs and benefits for society at large will be affected, as well as the distribution of these among the various interested parties. Different options for infrastructure investments are generally appraised by CBA (Cost/ Benefit Analysis). The same cannot be said to hold for infrastructure maintenance measures, of which winter maintenance of state maintained roads can be taken as an example. There are many reasons for making socio-economic analyses for infrastructure maintenance also, such as the winter maintenance of state maintained roads. For this reason, we have made an analysis of how the principles that are applied concerning CBA for investments in road infrastructure could be transferred to the framework constituted by the VTI Winter Model. The objective of this analysis was to study, with reference to the principles governing traditional CBA and its application by traffic administration agencies on the basis of the recommendations from the Swedish Institute for Transport and Communications Analysis, the way in which the application of CBA to the Winter Model may be formulated...|$|R
