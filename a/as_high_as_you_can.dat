500|$|A. A. Gill {{reviewed}} the restaurant for The Sunday Times after {{the move to}} the Oak Room in late 1997. He summarised his visit by saying that [...] "If {{you are interested in}} the pursuit of excellence, then a table at the Oak Room is <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> go in this country, and close to <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> go in the world." [...] He recommended the starters of red mullet soup, the ballotine of salmon, and the chicken oyster served with a celeriac remoulade. He called his main course [...] "utterly simple and completely perfect"; it consisted of roast partridge with choucroute garnie. He called the interior of the dining room [...] "soft and thick and luxurious", adding that a painting by Mark Gertler and three bronzes by Rembrandt Bugatti were [...] "worth the entrance fee alone".|$|E

[...] "They mayn't hold their heads quite <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> do,--or rather <b>as</b> <b>you</b> {{used to do}} when people thought that the establishment was all your own; but {{such as it is}} nobody can turn them out of their shop in the Market-place.

"Then I'll {{tell you}} why they were taken first: because the mist, when we came through it, only rose five or six feet above the stream, {{and we were in}} it, while you on board were above it. And those that were taken on board this morning, every one of them, slept on the main-deck, and every one of them, too, was in fear of the fever, whereby I judge two things,--Keep <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> and fear nothing but God, and we're all safe yet." ...|$|E

And so, after a while, you will get the whole pathway filled up with stones, <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> please.

[...] "To speak plain, I should have liked {{the service of}} the French King full well; only, dress me as fine and feed me <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> will, I love the open air better than being shut up in a cage or a swallow's nest yonder, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> call these same grated pepper boxes.

60|$|That is the can-can. The {{idea of it}} is {{to dance}} as wildly, as noisily, as furiously as you can; expose {{yourself}} {{as much as possible}} if you are a woman; and kick <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> no matter which sex you belong to. There is no word of exaggeration in this. Any of the staid, respectable, aged people who were there that night can testify to the truth of that statement. There were a good many such people present. I suppose French morality is not of that straight-laced description which is shocked at trifles.|$|E
6000|$|I can fancy your losing {{patience}} with me altogether just now. [...] "We asked this fellow down {{to tell our}} workmen how to make shawls, and he is only trying {{to teach them how}} to caricature." [...] But have a little {{patience with}} me, and examine, after I have done, a little for yourselves into the history of ornamental art, and you will discover why I do this. You will discover, I repeat, that all great ornamental art whatever is founded on the effort of the workman to draw the figure, and, in the best schools, to draw all that he saw about him in living nature. The best art of pottery is acknowledged to be that of Greece, and all the power of design exhibited in it, down to the merest zigzag, arises primarily from the workman having been forced to outline nymphs and knights; from those helmed and draped figures he holds his power. Of Egyptian ornament I have just spoken. You have everything given there that the workman saw; people of his nation employed in hunting, fighting, fishing, visiting, making love, building, cooking--everything they did is drawn, magnificently or familiarly, as was needed. In Byzantine ornament, saints, or animals which are types of various spiritual power, are the main subjects; and from the church down to the piece of enamelled metal, figure,--figure,--figure, always principal. In Norman and Gothic work you have, with all their quiet saints, also other much disquieted persons, hunting, feasting, fighting, and so on; or whole hordes of animals racing after each other. In the Bayeux tapestry, Queen Matilda gave, as well as she could,--in many respects graphically enough,--the whole history of the conquest of England. Thence, as you increase in power of art, you have more and more finished figures, up to the solemn sculptures of Wells Cathedral, or the cherubic enrichments of the Venetian Madonna dei Miracoli. Therefore, I will tell you fearlessly, for I know it is true, you must raise your workman up to life, or you will never get from him one line of well-imagined conventionalism. We have at present no good ornamental design. We can't have it yet, and we must be patient if we want to have it. Do not hope to feel the effect of your schools at once, but raise the men <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> and then let them stoop as low as you need; no great man ever minds stooping. Encourage the students, in sketching accurately and continually from nature anything that comes in their way--still life, flowers, animals; but, above all, figures; and so far as you allow of any difference between an artist's training and theirs, let it be, not in what they draw, but in the degree of conventionalism you require in the sketch.|$|E

She was writing a column for Newsweek in 1975 when she replaced Nicholas von Hoffman on 60 Minutes, and debated Kilpatrick for the next four years.

2500|$|During Guizot’s {{tenure as}} foreign minister, he and Lord Aberdeen, the foreign {{secretary}} to Sir Robert Peel, carried on well, and thus they secured France and Britain in the entente cordiale. Part {{of the formation}} of the entente came about when Guizot secured the transfer of Napoleon’s ashes from St. Helena to the French government. The opposition in France denounced Guizot's foreign policy as basely subservient to England. He replied in terms of unmeasured contempt: [...] "You may raise the pile of calumny <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> will; vous n'arriverez jamais a la hauteur de mon dédain!"

40|$|Have {{you ever}} {{noticed that the}} {{physical}} world works in certain ways? Skateboarders use force and motion to perform tricks. If you jump up <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> you'll quickly fall back to the ground. Baseball players use gravity to bring the ball back down when they throw it. When you flip a switch, electricity powers your toaster. Rock bands use electricity {{to put on a}} show. The fascinating science of physics helps you understand why forces, motion, gravity, electricity, light, and sound work in predictable ways. Combining inquiry-based activities with physics topics, Physics: Investigate the Forces of Nature features graphic novel illustrations, fascinating sidebars, youtube links, and a glossary of important vocabulary to illuminate the complex world of physics and bring it to life. Projects include designing a skateboard park that maps the forces at work on the skateboarder and the skateboard, and creating a stage design for a rock band that places electric current where it is needed. Additional materials include a timeline, a list of current reference works, and Internet resources.

After a lengthy analysis Dunning concluded: Col. Halt's thoroughness was commendable, but even he can be mistaken.

All that remains is the tale that the men were debriefed and ordered never to mention the event, and warned that [...] "bullets are cheap". Well, as we've seen on television, the men all talk quite freely about it, and even Col. Halt says that to this day nobody has ever debriefed him. So this appears to be just another dramatic invention for television, perhaps from {{one of the men who}} have expanded their stories over the years.When you examine each piece of evidence separately on its own merit, you avoid the trap of pattern matching and finding correlations where none exist. The meteors had nothing to do with the lighthouse or the rabbit diggings, but when you hear all three stories told together, it's easy to conclude (as did the airmen) that the light overhead became an alien spacecraft in the forest.
