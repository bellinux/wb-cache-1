5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, Bedell {{had decided to}} run for {{political}} office. In 1972, he ran against Wiley Mayne, a Republican incumbent in Iowa's 6th congressional district. Mayne was a staunch supporter of Richard Nixon and secured victory along with the President in a year favorable to the Republicans. Mayne, however, would politically suffer after Watergate (he was one of only a few Republicans to vote against impeaching the President on the judiciary committee.) The damage had <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>done,</b> and Bedell defeated Mayne in a 1974 rematch.|$|E
5|$|Various beetles in the Bostrichoidea {{superfamily}} {{attack the}} dry, seasoned wood used as structural timber in houses {{and to make}} furniture. In most cases, it is the larvae that do the damage; these are invisible from {{the outside of the}} timber, but are chewing away at the wood in the interior of the item. Examples of these are the powderpost beetles, which attack the sapwood of hardwoods, and the furniture beetles, which attacks softwoods, including plywood. The damage has <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> by the time the adult beetles bore their way out, leaving neat round holes behind them. The first that a householder knows about the beetle damage is often when a chair leg breaks off or a piece of structural timber caves in. Prevention is through chemical treatment of the timber prior to its use in construction or in furniture manufacture.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Mycale, the Allied fleet {{sailed to}} the Hellespont {{to break down}} the pontoon bridges, but found that this had <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>done.</b> The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians {{remained}} to attack the Chersonesos, still held by the Persians. The Persians and their allies made for Sestos, the strongest town in the region. Amongst them was one Oeobazus of Cardia, who had with him the cables and other equipment from the pontoon bridges. The Persian governor, Artayctes had not prepared for a siege, not believing that the Allies would attack. The Athenians therefore were able to lay a siege around Sestos. The siege dragged on for several months, causing some discontent amongst the Athenian troops, but eventually, when the food ran out in the City, the Persians fled at night from the least guarded area of the city. The Athenians were thus able to take possession of the city the next day.|$|E

5|$|The {{remnants}} of the Persian army, {{under the command of}} Artabazus, tried to retreat back to Asia Minor. Travelling through the lands of Thessaly, Macedonia and Thrace by the shortest road, Artabazus eventually made it back to Byzantium, though losing many men to Thracian attacks, weariness and hunger. After the victory at Mycale, the Allied fleet sailed to the Hellespont to break down the pontoon bridges, but found that this had <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>done.</b> The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians remained to attack the Chersonesos, still held by the Persians. The Persians in the region, and their allies, made for Sestos, the strongest town in the region, and the Athenians laid siege to them there. After a protracted siege Sestos fell to the Athenians, marking {{the beginning of a new}} phase in the Greco-Persian Wars, the Greek counterattack. Herodotus ended his Histories after the Siege of Sestos. Over the next 30 years the Greeks, primarily the Athenian-dominated Delian League, would expel (or help expel) the Persians from Macedon, Thrace, the Aegean islands and Ionia. Peace with Persia came in 449BC with the Peace of Callias, finally ending a half-century of warfare.|$|E
5|$|They {{pitched a}} number of live-action ideas to Kanbar and {{proposed}} that he invest in a development division of their company, paying them and covering their rent {{in exchange for a}} significant portion of the rights to any scripts that they might sell. Kanbar however, was interested in a more direct approach, and preferred to focus on trying to produce a single film. He had always been a great admirer of animation and was impressed after being shown a direct-to-DVD computer-animated short film that Cory had made called Wobots. He suggested the possibility of producing an animated feature with them that would tell a familiar story with a twist, and gave them a month to come up with a story idea. Kanbar had expressed interest in Cinderella or Pinocchio, but the Edwards brothers did not like these ideas as they had <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> by Walt Disney. A few days after the brothers' initial meeting with Kanbar, Todd found inspiration in non-linear crime dramas, such as Rashomon, Pulp Fiction, Run Lola Run, and Memento and came up with the idea of telling the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood as a police investigation, using multiple points of view.|$|E

25|$|The ancient {{counties}} {{had many}} anomalies, and many small exclaves, where a {{parcel of land}} was politically part of one county despite not being physically connected {{to the rest of}} the county. The Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844 modified the counties by abolishing the many enclaves of counties within others, which had <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> for Parliamentary purposes by the Great Reform Act.|$|E
25|$|The YF-12 {{program was}} a limited {{production}} variant of the A-12. Lockheed convinced the U.S. Air Force that an aircraft based on the A-12 would provide a less costly alternative to the recently canceled North American Aviation XF-108, since much of the design and development work on the YF-12 had <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> and paid for. Thus, in 1960 the Air Force agreed to take the seventh to ninth slots on the A-12 production line and have them completed in the YF-12A interceptor configuration.|$|E

25|$|The Pagan Empire {{collapsed}} in 1287 due to repeated Mongol invasions (1277–1301). Recent {{research shows that}} Mongol armies may not have reached Bagan itself, and {{that even if they}} did, the damage they inflicted was probably minimal. However, the damage had <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>done.</b> The city, once home to some 50,000 to 200,000 people, had been reduced to a small town, never to regain its preeminence. The city formally ceased to be the capital of Burma in December 1297 when the Myinsaing Kingdom became the new power in Upper Burma.|$|E
25|$|In {{all these}} struggles, {{he was more}} or less unsuccessful, owing partly {{to the fact that he}} and his forces had to oppose {{superior}} generals (e.g. Jan Karol Chodkiewicz and Christian IV of Denmark) and partly to sheer ill-luck. Compared with his foreign policy, the domestic policy of Charles IX was comparatively unimportant. It aimed at confirming and supplementing what had <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> during his regency. He did not officially become king until 22 March 1604. The first deed in which the title appears is dated 20 March 1604; but he was not crowned until 15 March 1607.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1920s the first High Commissioner of Palestine, Herbert Samuel, failed {{to create a}} unified {{political}} structure embracing both Palestinian Arabs and Palestinian Jews in constitutional government with joint political institutions. This failure facilitated internal institutional partition in which the Jewish Agency exercised a degree of autonomous control over the Jewish settlement and the Supreme Muslim Council performed a comparable role for Muslims. Thus, well before Lord Peel arrived in Palestine on 11 November 1936, the groundwork for territorial partition as proposed by the Royal Commission in its report on 7 July 1937 had <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E

25|$|When Zhuhu Gaoqi was {{in control}} of the {{imperial}} court in 1217, he foolishly decided to invade the Han Chinese-led Southern Song dynasty in southern China {{for the first time in}} nearly 30 years. This war lasted until 1224 and was a total failure for the Jin dynasty. In 1224, Emperor Aizong declared that the Jin dynasty would never again invade the Song dynasty. But the damage had <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> - the Jin forces had been split between north and south at a critical stage in the war with the Mongols when Zhongdu, Hebei and Shandong provinces had fallen and Shanxi Province was being attacked. Many Khitan mercenaries left the Jurchen armies and joined the Mongols.|$|E

25|$|Mutagenesis experiment: The {{direct method}} to {{investigate}} the DFE is to induce mutations and then measure the mutational fitness effects, which has <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> in viruses, bacteria, yeast, and Drosophila.

In Escherichia coli, one study used transposon mutagenesis to directly measure the fitness of a random insertion of a derivative of Tn10. In yeast, a combined mutagenesis and deep sequencing approach has been developed to generate high-quality systematic mutant libraries and measure fitness in high throughput. However, given that many mutations have effects {{too small to be}} detected and that mutagenesis experiments can detect only mutations of moderately large effect; DNA sequence data analysis can provide valuable information about these mutations.|$|E

25|$|The {{second test}} saw a less convincing {{performance}} from England, being bowled out for 198 {{in their first}} innings. To make matters worse, India made a huge 481 {{to put them in}} control of the test match. England batted bravely in the second innings, posting 355, but by then the damage had <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> and India required just 73 to win the match.

On the third and final test, India played for a draw, posting 664 in their first innings and showing little interest in declaring. After England were bowled out for 345 in response, India decided against enforcing the follow on. India finally declared on 180/6, setting England 500 to win. Batting admirably, England finished on 369/6. Hence the match ended in a draw, and India clinched the series 1-0. This marked Moores first defeat as Coach of England.|$|E
