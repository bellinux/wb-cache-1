Oppenheimer {{objected to the}} play, {{threatening}} suit [...] and decrying [...] "improvisations which were contrary to history and {{to the nature of}} the people involved", including its portrayal of him as viewing the bomb as a [...] "work of the devil". His letter to Kipphardt said, [...] "You may well have forgotten Guernica, Dachau, Coventry, Belsen, Warsaw, Dresden and Tokyo. I have not." [...] Of his security hearing, he said, [...] "The whole damn thing was a farce, <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> trying to make a tragedy out of it." ...|$|E

6000|$|The nomes are a {{numerous}} and mischievous people, living in underground caverns of wide extent, connected one with another by arches and passages. The word [...] "nome" [...] means [...] "one who knows," [...] <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> so called {{because they know}} where all the gold and silver and precious stones are hidden in the earth--a knowledge that no other living creatures share with them. The nomes are busy people, constantly digging up gold {{in one place and}} taking it to another place, where they secretly bury it, and perhaps this is the reason they alone know where to find it. The nomes were ruled, at the time of which I write, by a King named Kaliko.|$|E

Who's the Grand Master of the sign cut in the stone?' says he, and he thumped {{his hand on the}} block that he used to sit on in Lodge, and at Council, which opened like Lodge always.

"Note that {{in ancient}} times Anglia [...] was {{inhabited}} by giants, but some Trojans who had survived the slaughter of Troy came to this island, fought its inhabitants and defeated them; after their prince, Brutus, it was named Britannia.

60|$|Among {{those who}} hunt {{there are two}} classes of hunting people who always like it, <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> hunting parsons and hunting ladies. That it should be so is natural enough. In the life and habits of parsons and ladies {{there is much that}} is {{antagonistic}} to hunting, and they who suppress this antagonism do so because they are Nimrods at heart. But the riding of these horsemen under difficulties, horsemen and horsewomen, leaves a strong impression on the casual observer of hunting; for to such an one it seems that the hardest riding is forthcoming exactly where no hard riding should be expected. On the present occasion I will, if you please, confine myself to the lady who rides to hounds, and will begin with an assertion, which will not be contradicted, that the number of such ladies is very much on the increase.|$|E

60|$|But {{all this}} Guess and Uncertainty is a Trifle, {{to the vast}} Discoveries of these Explicatory Optick-Glasses; for here are seen the Nature and Consequences of Secret Mysteries: Here are read strange Mysteries {{relating}} to Predestination, Eternal Decrees, and the like: Here 'tis plainly prov'd, That Predestination is, in spight of all Enthusiastick Pretences, so intirely committed into Man's Power, that whoever pleases to hang himself to Day, won't Live till to Morrow: no, though Forty Predestination Prophets were to tell him, His time was not yet come. There abstruse Points are commonly and solemnly Discuss'd here; <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>People</b> <b>are</b> such Hereticks, that they say God's Decrees are all subservient to the means of his Providence; That what we call Providence is a subjecting all things to the great Chain of Causes and Consequences, by which that one Grand Decree, That all Effects shall Obey, without reserve to their proper moving Causes, supercedes all subsequent Doctrines, or pretended Decrees, or Predestination in the World: That by this Rule, he that will kill himself, GOD, Nature, Providence, or Decree, will not be concern'd to hinder him, but he shall Die; any Decrees, Predestination, or Fore-Knowledge of Infinite Power, to the contrary in any wise, notwithstanding {{that it is in}} a Man's Power to throw himself into the Water, and be Drown'd; and to kill another Man, and he shall Die, and to say, God appointed it, is to make him the Author of Murther, and to injure the Murtherer in putting him to Death for what he could not help doing.|$|E
6000|$|Akhawat, or “brotherhood,” {{denotes the}} tie between the {{stranger}} and the Badawi, who asserts an immemorial and inalienable {{right to the}} soil upon which his forefathers fed their flocks. Trespass by a neighbour instantly causes war. Territorial increase is rarely attempted, for if of a whole clan but a single boy escape he will one day assert his claim to the land, and be assisted by all the Ashab, or [p.114] allies of the slain. By paying to man, woman, or child, a small sum, varying, according to your means, from a few pence worth of trinkets {{to a couple of}} dollars, you share bread and salt with the tribe, you and your horse become Dakhil (protected), and every one must afford you brother-help. If traveller or trader attempt to pass through the land without paying Al-Akhawah or Al-Rifkah, as it is termed, he must expect to be plundered, and, resisting, to be slain: it is no dishonour to pay it, and he clearly is in the wrong who refuses to conform to custom. The Rafik, under different names, exists throughout this part of the world; at Sinai he was called a Ghafir, a Rabia in Eastern Arabia, amongst the Somal an Abban, and by the Gallas a Mogasa. I have called the tax “black-mail”; it deserves a better name, being clearly the rudest form of those transit-dues and octrois which are in nowise improved by “progress.” The Ahl Bayt,[FN#51] or dwellers in the Black Tents, levy the tax from the Ahl Hayt, or the People of Walls; that is to say, townsmen and villagers who have forfeited right to be held Badawin. It is demanded from bastard Arabs, and from tribes who, like the Hutaym and the Khalawiyah, have been born basely or have become “nidering.” <b>And</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> obliged to pay it at home as well as abroad. Then it becomes a sign of disgrace, and the pure clans, like the Benu Harb, will not give their damsels in marriage to “brothers.” ...|$|E

Azerbaijanis are being written out of the history of Armenia, and Armenians refer to Muslim monuments as [...] "Persian", even though the worshippers in a mosque built in 1760 would have been Turkic-speaking Shiite subjects of Safavid dynasty, i.e. the ancestors of Azerbaijanis.|$|R
