5|$|On {{the night}} of the 1911 census, 2 April, Davison hid in a {{cupboard}} in St Mary Undercroft, the chapel of the Palace of Westminster.

She was found by a cleaner, who reported her presence; Davison was arrested but not charged. The Clerk of Works at the House of Commons completed a census form to include Davison in the returns. She was included in the census twice, as her landlady also included her as being present at her lodgings.
