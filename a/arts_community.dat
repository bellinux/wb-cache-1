5|$|From the {{unexpected}} realism {{of his first}} major figure – inspired by his 1875 trip to Italy – to the unconventional memorials whose commissions he later sought, Rodin's reputation grew, such that he became the preeminent French sculptor of his time. By 1900, he was a world-renowned artist. Wealthy private clients sought Rodin's work after his World's Fair exhibit, and he kept company {{with a variety of}} high-profile intellectuals and artists. He married his lifelong companion, Rose Beuret, {{in the last year of}} both their lives. His sculptures suffered a decline in popularity after his death in 1917, but within a few decades, his legacy solidified.
