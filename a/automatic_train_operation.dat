5|$|During normal {{passenger}} {{operation on}} revenue tracks, trains {{are designed to}} be controlled by an integrated <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> <b>Operation</b> (ATO) and Automatic Train Control (ATC) system that accelerates and brakes trains automatically without operator intervention. All trains are still manned with train operators who open and close the doors, make station announcements, and supervise their trains. The system was designed so that an operator could manually operate a train when necessary.|$|E
5|$|At present, all Singapore lines {{run with}} fixed length trains {{between three and}} six cars, with the future Thomson-East Coast Line using four cars. Since the system's {{conception}} in 1987, all train lines have been powered by the 750 volt DC third rail, {{with the exception of}} the North East Line which is powered by 1500 volt DC overhead lines. The North South and East West lines uses an <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> <b>operation</b> system that is similar to London Underground's Victoria line.|$|E
5|$|The entire metro {{system and}} the trains are run by a fully {{automated}} computer system, located at the Control and Maintenance Center south of Vestamager Station. The automatic train control (ATC) consists of three subsystems: automatic train protection (ATP), <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> <b>operation</b> (ATO) and automatic train supervisory (ATS). The ATP is responsible for keeping the trains' speed, ensuring that doors are closed before departure and switches are correctly set. The system uses fixed block signaling, except around stations, where moving block signaling is used.|$|E
25|$|The Shinkansen employs an ATC (<b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> Control) system, {{eliminating}} the need for trackside signals. It uses a comprehensive system of <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> Protection. Centralized traffic control manages all <b>train</b> <b>operations,</b> and all tasks relating to train movement, track, station and schedule are networked and computerized.|$|R
5|$|The system {{currently}} uses Automatic Block Signaling with fixed wayside {{signals and}} <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> stops {{in order to}} provide safe <b>train</b> <b>operation</b> across the whole system. The New York City Subway system has, for the most part, used block signalling since its 1904 opening, and many portions of the signaling system were installed between the 1930s and 1960s.|$|R
30|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> Control (ATC) Systems, {{composed}} of an on-board-trains part and trackside part, {{are intended to}} supervise and control the maximum train speed and automatically brake in case of need. In this way they improve the safety and adjust the <b>train</b> <b>operations</b> to guarantee punctuality (according to the schedule) and comfort [44, 76]. One example of automated train control is the communication-based train control system [160 – 162].|$|R
5|$|The AirTrain JFK {{portion of}} this station has two tracks and one island {{platform}} on the upper level of the station complex. The eastern end of the AirTrain platform leads to Parking Area C. Unlike the New York City Subway platforms, the AirTrain JFK platforms are entirely enclosed and feature platform screen doors, which help the station maintain a constant temperature and prevent passengers from falling onto the tracks. An array of sensors detect a train's position on the track, and only when it is properly aligned will the train's doors open. This enables the AirTrain to use <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> <b>operation</b> without drivers.|$|E
5|$|In September 2015, the {{president}} of SBASE highlighted plans for 2015–2019 on the Underground at a conference with other South American mass transit operators in Brazil. One of the largest changes to be made during this period is the upgrading of signalling systems on all lines, {{with the exception of}} Line E. Lines A and B are to receive <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> <b>Operation</b> systems, replacing their ATS and ATP systems respectively, whilst lines C, D and H are to receive Communications Based Train Control systems. The implementation of these systems was already under way on Lines C and H as of September 2015, and is due to be completed on other lines before 2019. Line D is also te receive platform screen doors along with the CBTC system.|$|E

40|$|Keywords-train {{predictive}} scheduling; model {{predictive control}} (MPC); genetic algorithm; {{centralized traffic control}} (CTC); <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> protection (ATP) Abstract. In the high-speed train control system, the command information such as allowable running distance, time and speed can be sent by the global system for mobile communications for railways (GSM-R). This paper will propose the framework of real-time train scheduling and control based on model predictive control for the optimal speed set-points of high-speed trains. The rolling optimization process combines the genetic algorithm with the simulation of <b>train</b> <b>operation</b> to evaluate the performance of speed set-points, which can be easily implemented in the parallel computing environment for real-time processing. The conflict resolution at the crossing stations is modeled by and embedded in the combination of various speed set-points which are formed from virtual to simulation speed. The final actual speed of train is engendered based on the movement authority and running time through the system of <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> protection (ATP). The simulation results demonstrate the favorable performance of proposed method...|$|R

50|$|An <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> stop or ATS is {{a system}} on a train that {{automatically}} stops a train if certain situations occur (unresponsive train operator, earthquake, disconnected rail, train running over a stop signal, etc.) to prevent accidents. In some scenarios it functions {{as a type of}} dead man's switch. <b>Automatic</b> <b>train</b> stop differs from the concept of <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> Control in that ATS does not feature an onboard speed control mechanism.|$|R

25|$|Waterloo & City line – The {{line was}} {{upgraded}} with five new 1992-stock trains {{in the early}} 1990s, {{at the same time}} as the Central line was upgraded. The line operates under traditional signalling and does not use <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> <b>Operation.</b> The line will be part of the New Tube for London Project. This will replace the existing fleet with new air-cooled walkthrough trains and a new signaling system to allow <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> <b>Operation.</b> The line is predicted to run 30 trains per hour, up to a 50% increase compared to the current 21-trains-per-hour service. The line may also be one of the first to be upgraded, alongside the Piccadilly line, with new trains, systems and platform-edge doors to test the systems before the Central and Bakerloo lines are upgraded.|$|E
