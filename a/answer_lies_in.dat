25|$|Included in the Indexes, at one point, {{were many}} of the great works of Spanish literature. Also, a number of {{religious}} writers who are today considered saints by the Catholic Church saw their works appear in the Indexes. At first, this might seem counter-intuitive or even nonsensical—how were these Spanish authors published {{in the first place}} if their texts were then prohibited by the Inquisition and placed in the Index? The <b>answer</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> the process of publication and censorship in Early Modern Spain. Books in Early Modern Spain faced prepublication licensing and approval (which could include modification) by both secular and religious authorities. However, once approved and published, the circulating text also faced the possibility of post-hoc censorship by being denounced to the Inquisition—sometimes decades later. Likewise, as Catholic theology evolved, once-prohibited texts might be removed from the Index.|$|E
25|$|How {{can this}} be {{rational}} for both investors? The <b>answer</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> {{the fact that the}} investors do not have to invest the full 100,000 US dollars. Max Return is content to invest only 10,000 US dollars for now. After all, Max Return may rationalize the outcome by thinking that maybe tomorrow there will be new opportunities available to invest the remaining 90,000 US dollars the bank is willing to lend Max Return, at even higher IRRs. Even if only seven more projects come along which are identical to Small-Is-Beautiful, Max Return would be able to match the NPV of Big-Is-Best, on a total investment of only 80,000 US dollars, with 20,000 US dollars left in the budget to spare for truly unmissable opportunities. Max Value is also happy, because she has filled her capital budget straight away, and decides she can take {{the rest of the year}} off investing.|$|E

That is, when can we geometrically cancel handles if this condition is true? The <b>answer</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> carefully analyzing when the manifold remains simply-connected after removing the attaching and belt spheres in question, and finding an embedded disk using the Whitney trick. This analysis leads to the requirement that n {{must be at least}} 5.

2500|$|Many {{pages of}} notes and commentaries {{describe}} in details various approaches to global strategies, and their limits. Such are Strategic ecosystem: beyond [...] "The Plan", Governance (a series of pages on {{reports from the}} Club of Rome, the Commission on Global Governance, and four others groups), Strategic denial: action inhibition, Post-crisis opportunities: range of strategies, and Post-crisis opportunities: strategies in chaos. A long series of pages explores how to [...] "move beyond the unimodal answer and recognize that because each form of action has both strengths and weaknesses, {{the key to a}} more effectively multimodal <b>answer</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> finding how to interrelate the various unimodal answers so that they correct for each others weaknesses and counteract each others excesses.” But, it must also be asked, is integrated action of any type feasible at this time? The exploration begins with Strategic appropriateness: questionable answers, and finishes with Action implications: consensus, uncertainty and action formulation. Conditions for progress in strategy-making are more explicitly brought up in pages such as Strategic ecosystem: integrating constraint and opposition, and Post-crisis opportunities: in quest of radical coherence.|$|E
60|$|But {{if that is}} so, {{you will}} ask, {{why is it that}} they have not made more {{impression}} upon the enemy's position? The <b>answer</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> the strategical position of Italy, and it can be discussed without any technicalities. A child could understand it. The Alps form such a bar across the north that there are only two points where serious operations are possible. One is the Trentino Salient where Austria can always threaten and invade Italy. She lies in the mountains with the plains beneath her. She can always invade the plain, but the Italians cannot seriously invade the mountains, since the passes would only lead to other mountains beyond. Therefore their only possible policy is to hold the Austrians back. This they have most successfully done, and though the Austrians {{with the aid of a}} shattering heavy artillery have recently made some advance, it is perfectly certain that they can never really carry out any serious invasion. The Italians then have done all that could be done in this quarter. There remains the other front, the opening by the sea. Here the Italians had a chance to advance over a front of plain bounded by a river with hills beyond. They cleared the plain, they crossed the river, they fought a battle very like our own battle of the Aisne upon the slopes of the hills, taking 20,000 Austrian prisoners, and now they are faced by barbed wire, machine guns, cemented trenches, and every other device which has held them as it has held every one else. But remember what they have done for the common cause and be grateful for it. They have in a year occupied some forty Austrian divisions, and relieved our Russian allies to that very appreciable extent. They have killed or wounded a quarter of a million, taken 40,000, and drawn to themselves a large portion of the artillery. That is their record up to date. As to the future it is very easy to prophesy. They will continue to absorb large enemy armies. Neither side can advance far as matters stand. But if the Russians advance and Austria has to draw her men to the East, there will be a tiger spring for Trieste. If manhood can break the line, then I believe the Durandos will do it.|$|E

30|$|The {{field of}} higher {{education}} in general and STEM education in particular continues to grapple with how to best facilitate learning, persistence, and retention throughout students’ postsecondary careers. Does the <b>answer</b> <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> changing teacher behaviors alone, such as the adoption of active learning techniques, structural responses such as reducing student debt and dealing with the rising price of college, or is success also dependent upon student attributes such as engagement and motivation? What these questions reveal is that students’ experiences in college are shaped by a variety of influences and that the intersection among policy, economics, organizations, and instruction provides a more accurate frame for thinking about student success than a search for a single “magic bullet” solution.|$|R
5000|$|An {{important}} question raised by this interpretation is how mere symbols could exert material effects. One possible <b>answer</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> John L.

The difference, then, is a connection to words (more specifically, to the [...] "memory residue" [...] of words.)
