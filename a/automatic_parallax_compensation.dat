5000|$|The Zorki-35M full-frame 35mm coupled-rangefinder {{camera was}} a project {{undertaken}} by KMZ designer N. Marienkov {{during the late}} 1960s (the [...] "M" [...] is his [...] "signature" [...] camera; he also designed the Zorki 3M and the Zenit 3M). It {{was based on the}} body of the Zenit E and some of the advanced design features of the Zenit D, but as a rangefinder rather than SLR camera. It was to feature bright-line frames in the viewfinder for 50mm and 85mm lenses, with the entire field of the viewfinder corresponding to that of a 35mm lens. Other advances included <b>automatic</b> <b>parallax</b> <b>compensation,</b> speeds from 1 to 1/1000 sec. and a modern body design. It was probably an attempt to make an updated alternative for the then aging Zorki 4. At least two hand-built prototypes of this camera are known to exist, and the KMZ archives list it as a [...] "project", but it never went into production.|$|E
40|$|Adaptive {{automation}} {{appears to}} be one of the next most challenging milestones in the field of aviation and air traffic management. This approach is aimed to be human centered (Billings, 1996) and has to be user-friendly in order to increase safety (Flightpath 2050). The detection of human operators’ performance inevitably has to be the first step in this activity (Maiwald & Schulte, 2011). Here the edges of acceptable behaviour have to be identified well in time, which means that points where human performance deteriorates have to be found. This has led to the notion of a Human Performance Envelope (Graziani et al., 2016). Within this context a reliable on-line recording and analysis of operational data is needed. In a second step, these data will then set the trigger and recommend when a redistributions of tasks has to take place and a higher level of automation has to take over. While new identification means like behavioral markers (Edwards, 2013, 2014) are under investigation, physiological parameters like ECG, EEG and eye-tracking are still prominent candidates thanks to new sensors and improved computational methods. These sources are critical in signalling performance degradation. The eye tracking data of this paper were gained in a flight simulator study with ten flight crews in the project “Human Performance Envelope” of the programme Future Sky Safety funded by the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 initiative. Here physiological changes like gaze fixation and fast eye movements were measured. While eye-tracking data already proved to be a good indicator for Situation Awareness level 1 “perception” (Biella et al., 2005; Manske, 2015), this analysis will investigate how pilot’s gaze will be indicate Situation Awareness level 3 “projection”. A set of 22 areas of interest was defined in DLR’s A 320 flight simulator AVES. Four of them match simulator’s outside view while the other ones are dedicated to instrument panels. The eye-tracking system continuously evaluates from the pupil measurements and the head position which area of interest the operator is looking at. In our study we will show if and how the pilot was paying well in advance attention to the relevant displays where he expects the next crucial information. For the recording of the eye movements the comfortable Eye Tracking Glasses of SensoMotoric Instruments (SMI) were used. SMI’s eye tracking technology provides binocular tracking up to a 120 Hz sampling rate. Combined with a high definition scene camera and <b>automatic</b> <b>parallax</b> <b>compensation</b> this ensures accurate data over all distances. Data and visuals such as heat maps or Key Eye Tracking Metrics were the starting point for this analysis. The results of this study will show how to increase the envelope to improve both performance and safety. First indicators for a development of effective recovery measures through innovative Human Performance Envelope based solutions will be given as well. In addition to that, these results will be of additional benefit for flight instructors in pilot training. Implications for simulator training in terms of an improved instructor working position can be expected...|$|E

50|$|One of {{its best}} {{features}} was a 3-position viewfinder with rotating prisms, which could be set to 35mm, 50mm and RF. In the RF setting, accessory shoe-mounted viewfinders with <b>automatic</b> <b>parallax</b> correction would be used.|$|R
50|$|The {{viewfinder}} {{had neither}} lines for <b>parallax</b> <b>compensation,</b> nor for outlining {{the edge of}} the negative. With the camera held to take a picture in landscape format, the center mounting and poor enlargement of the viewfinder required the user to press the nose rather hard against the camera back. There was no rangefinder.|$|R
50|$|To {{eliminate}} parallax induced aiming errors, telescopic sights can {{be equipped}} with a <b>parallax</b> <b>compensation</b> mechanism which basically consists of a movable optical element that enables the optical system to project the picture of objects at varying distances and the reticle crosshairs pictures together {{in exactly the same}} optical plane. There are two main methods to achieve this.|$|R
50|$|In optical {{instruments}} such as telescopes, microscopes, or in telescopic sights used on small arms and theodolites, the error {{occurs when the}} optics are not precisely focused: the reticle will appear to move {{with respect to the}} object focused on if one moves one's head sideways in front of the eyepiece. Some firearm telescopic sights are equipped with a <b>parallax</b> <b>compensation</b> mechanism which basically consists of a movable optical element that enables the optical system to project the picture of objects at varying distances and the reticle crosshairs pictures together in exactly the same optical plane. Telescopic sights may have no <b>parallax</b> <b>compensation</b> because they can perform very acceptably without refinement for parallax with the sight being permanently adjusted for the distance that best suits their intended usage. Typical standard factory parallax adjustment distances for hunting telescopic sights are 100 yd or 100 m to make them suited for hunting shots that rarely exceed 300 yd/m. Some target and military style telescopic sights without <b>parallax</b> <b>compensation</b> may be adjusted to be parallax free at ranges up to 300 yd/m to make them better suited for aiming at longer ranges. Scopes for rimfires, shotguns, and muzzleloaders will have shorter parallax settings, commonly 50 yd/m for rimfire scopes and 100 yd/m for shotguns and muzzleloaders. Scopes for airguns are very often found with adjustable parallax, usually {{in the form of an}} adjustable objective, or AO. These may adjust down as far as 3 yards (2.74 m).|$|R
50|$|Most {{telescopic}} sights lack <b>parallax</b> <b>compensation</b> {{because they}} can perform very acceptably without this refinement. Telescopic sights manufacturers adjust these scopes at a distance that best suits their intended usage. Typical standard factory parallax adjustment distances for hunting telescopic sights are 100 yd or 100 m to make them suited for hunting shots that rarely exceed 300 yd/m. Some long range target and military style telescopic sights without <b>parallax</b> <b>compensation</b> may be adjusted to be parallax free at ranges up to 300 yd/m to make them better suited for aiming at 300+ yd/m ranges. Scopes for rimfire guns, shotguns, and muzzleloaders that are rarely fired at 100 yd/m+ ranges will have shorter parallax settings, commonly 50 yd/m for rimfire scopes and 100 yd/m for shotguns and muzzleloaders. Scopes for airguns that are commonly used at short ranges are very often found with adjustable parallax, usually {{in the form of}} an adjustable objective, or AO. These may adjust down as far as 3 yd.|$|R
50|$|Most {{contemporary}} telescopic sights {{offer the}} first three adjustment controls. The other three are found on telescopic sights that offer a variable magnification, an illuminated reticle and/or <b>parallax</b> <b>compensation.</b> A rather common problem with the elevation and windage adjustment controls is that once smooth working adjustment turrets 'get stuck' over the years. This is generally caused by long term lack of movement in the lubricated turret mechanisms.|$|R
5000|$|Viewfinder cameras do {{not show}} exactly the same image in the {{viewfinder}} and on the film, due to {{the distance of the}} viewfinder to the view axis of the lens. This parallax problem is compensated in the M3 by moving the framelines when the lens is focused. This full <b>parallax</b> <b>compensation</b> is limited to one metre; closer distances require special [...] "Leica glasses" [...] as described above.|$|R
40|$|The {{last decade}} {{has seen a}} booming of the {{applications}} of stereoscopic images/videos and the corresponding technologies, such as 3 D modeling, reconstruction, and disparity estimation. However, only a very limited number of stereoscopic image quality assessment metrics was proposed through the years. In this paper, we propose a new no-reference stereoscopic image quality assessment algorithm based on the nonlinear additive model, ocular dominance model, and saliency based <b>parallax</b> <b>compensation.</b> Our studies using the Toyama database result in three valuable findings. First, quality of the stereoscopic image has a nonlinear relationship with a direct summation of two monoscopic image qualities. Second, it is a rational assumption that the right-eye response has the higher impact on the stereoscopic image quality, {{which is based on}} a sampling survey in the ocular dominance research. Third, the saliency based <b>parallax</b> <b>compensation,</b> resulted from different stereoscopic image contents, is considerably valid to improve the prediction performance of image quality metrics. Experimental results confirm that our proposed stereoscopic image quality assessment paradigm has superior prediction accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art competitors...|$|R
50|$|After the war, Leitz {{continued}} {{to produce the}} late versions of the Leica II and the Leica III through the 1950s. However, in 1954, Leitz introduced the Leica M3, with the new Leica M mount, a bayonet-like lens mount. The new camera also combined the rangefinder and viewfinder into one large, bright viewfinder with a brighter double image in the center. This system also introduced a system of <b>parallax</b> <b>compensation</b> and a new rubberized, reliable, focal-plane shutter. Leica continues to refine this model (the latest versions being the MP and MA, {{both of which have}} frames for 28, 35, 50, 75, 90, and 135 mm lenses, which show automatically upon mounting).|$|R
50|$|Considered {{the higher}} end of Soviet {{military}} side-mount telescopic sights, {{the quality of}} the PSO-1 is higher than most other PSO-style telescopic sights. The PSO-1 has neither a focus adjustment nor a <b>parallax</b> <b>compensation</b> control. Most modern military tactical scopes with lower power fixed magnification such as the ACOG, C79 optical sight or SUSAT (intended for rapid close-intermediate range shots rather than long-range sniping) lack such features as well. Modern fixed magnification military high-end-grade sniper telescopic sights scopes intended for long-range shooting usually offer one or both of these features. The positioning of the scope’s body {{to the left of the}} bore’s center line may not be comfortable to all shooters.|$|R
50|$|The {{reason why}} scopes {{intended}} for short range use are often equipped with <b>parallax</b> <b>compensation</b> {{is that at}} short range (and at high magnification) parallax errors become more noticeable. A typical scope objective has a focal length of 100 mm. An optical ideal 10&times; scope in this example has been perfectly parallax corrected at 1000 m and functions flawlessly at that distance. If the same scope is used at 100 m the target-picture would be projected (1000 m / 100 m) / 100 mm = 0.1 mm behind the reticle plane. At 10&times; magnification the error would be 10 &times; 0.1 mm = 1 mm at the ocular. If the same scope was used at 10 m the target-picture would be (1000 m / 10 m) / 100 mm = 1 mm projected behind the reticle plane. When magnified ten times the error would be 10 mm at the ocular.|$|R
5000|$|Because the {{photographer}} views through one lens but takes the photograph through another, parallax error makes the photograph {{different from the}} view on the screen. This difference is negligible when the subject is far away, but is critical for nearby subjects. <b>Parallax</b> <b>compensation</b> may be performed by {{the photographer}} in adjustment of the sight line while compensating for the framing change, or for highly repeatable accuracy in tabletop photography (in which the subject might be within a foot (30 cm) of the camera), devices are available that move the camera upwards so that the taking lens goes to the exact position that the viewing lens occupied. very accurate version was called the Para-mender, and mounted on a tripod. Some TLRs like the Rolleiflex (a notable early example is the Voigtländer Superb of 1933) also came with - more or less complex - devices to adjust parallax with focussing.|$|R
50|$|The Rollei 16 used special Super 16 film {{cartridges}} with {{a capacity}} of 18 frames. As no film manufacturer was interested in making this film format, Rollei had to manufacture the film itself. A roll of B/W film cost 5 DM, while slide film (available until 1981) cost 12.50 DM, including development. Loading the film simply required inserting the leader into the appropriate slot in the camera. Since there was no take-up spool, the film coiled up loosely on itself. Without a doubt, limited film choice and availability adversely affected camera sales, consequently only 25,000 units were produced. As Rollei also spent a lot on advertising, this camera did little to alleviate its dire financial situation. Reliance on a film format that Kodak, the market leader, did not support was foolhardy. Needless to say, {{the quality of the}} engineering in the Rollei 16 matched its high price; it had a push-pull viewfinder with <b>automatic</b> <b>parallax</b> correction up to 40 cm, whereby extending the viewfinder also wound on the film and cocked the shutter. In addition, Mutar wide-angle (0.5×) and telephoto (1.7×) conversion lenses were available as accessories. An improved successor, the Rollei 16S, was released in 1965.|$|R
40|$|Vascular lesions {{are common}} in infants and {{children}} and can be grouped into two main classifications: vascular tumors and vascular malformations. Hemangiomas are proliferative lesions characterized by increased endothelial cell turnover. Vascular malformations are congenital abnormalities involving capillaries, veins and/or lymphatics. A multidisciplinary approach regarding {{diagnosis and treatment of}} vascular anomalies in children is crucial. Several options are available for the treatment of hemangiomas. Since January 2003, 14 cases of hemangioma located in the cervicofacial region were treated at "La Sapienza" University. Seven patients underwent surgical resection, using Varioscope, and seven laser therapy. The Varioscope is an operating microscope, which is mounted on the head. Specific advantages convinced the authors to use the Varioscope initially. Autofocus, a magnification range between 3. 6 - 7. 2 X and <b>automatic</b> <b>parallax</b> control allow unlimited freedom of movement which alleviates the discomfort of keeping the same distance for a long time. Laser therapy can selectively destroy specific targets within the skin by using an appropriate wavelength and pulse duration. Laser treatment parameters are based on several factors, including lesion location, lesion morphology, and patient skin type. The purpose of our study was aesthetic and functional improvement in patients comparing surgical and laser therapy. We obtained an aesthetic improvement in 11 patients and local pain control in all patients. Analysis of the cosmetic results was subjective but all parents indicated satisfaction with their decision regarding their child's treatment...|$|R
50|$|Given these inputs, the Mark 1 {{automatically}} computed {{the lead}} angles {{to the future}} position of the target {{at the end of}} the projectile's time of flight, adding in corrections for gravity, relative wind, the magnus effect of the spinning projectile, and <b>parallax,</b> the latter <b>compensation</b> necessary because the guns themselves were widely displaced along the length of the ship. Lead angles and corrections were added to the LOS data to generate the line-of-fire (LOF) data. The LOF data, bearing and elevation, as well as the projectile's fuze time, was sent to the turrets by synchro motors, whose motion actuated hydraulic machinery to aim the guns.|$|R
