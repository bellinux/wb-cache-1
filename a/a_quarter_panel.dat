50|$|<b>A</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> (British English: rear wing) is {{the body}} panel (exterior surface) of an {{automobile}} between a rear door (or only door on each side for two-door models) and the trunk (boot) and typically wraps around the wheel well. The similar front section between {{the door and the}} hood (bonnet), is called a fender, but is sometimes incorrectly also referred to as <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b> Quarter panels are typically made of sheet metal, but are sometimes made of fiberglass, carbon fiber, or fiber-reinforced plastic. <b>A</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> is typically a welded-on component of the unibody structure. Replacement of a sheet metal quarter panel typically requires it to be cut off the vehicle and a replacement part to be welded (or sometimes bonded) to the vehicle. Due to the high amount of specialized labor, <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> may often be repaired rather than replaced by hammering the damaged area to a relatively flat surface and then applying a body filler to smooth out the damaged area to match the original surface. The panel is then usually painted and often clear coated.|$|E
50|$|The bolted panel {{which covers}} the wheel on dual rear wheel pickup trucks {{is called a}} fender. A pickup truck with a {{separate}} bed but without bolt on fenders has a bedside, which performs the function of a fender. When {{the side of the}} bed is welded to the cab, as with the Cadillac Escalade and Chevrolet Avalanche, it is called <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
50|$|In current US auto {{industry}} nomenclature, usually only the panels {{over the front}} wheels are called fenders. The {{auto industry}} changed from rear fenders bolted onto <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> to an enlarged welded-on quarter panel that fulfilled both functions. This resulted in one piece where there had previously been two, and name of the larger welded piece, the quarter panel, survived the consolidation. Quarter panels are at the rear, with an exception made for dual rear wheel trucks, where the panel at the rear is called a fender. For vehicles with a narrow car body that exposes the tire, the fender is an exposed curve {{over the top of}} the tire. For wide body vehicles that cover the tire, the fender forms the wheel well surrounding the tire, and is not directly visible from above the car body.|$|E
50|$|A Sprint package {{offered in}} 1972 {{featured}} a special red, white, and blue paint with matching interior. With similar packages offered on the Pinto and the Mustang, the trim package patriotically acknowledged the 1972 Olympics and {{was available for}} only one year. U.S. versions were given a stylized U.S. flag made into <b>a</b> rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> decal. The badge {{was very much in}} the vein of Olympic symbols, but without being too close, to avoid copyright infringement. Sprints sold in Canada were also red, white, and blue, but had <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> badge styled from the Canadian flag.|$|R
50|$|The {{most extreme}} tailfins {{appeared}} in the late 1950s, such as on the 1959 Cadillac Eldorado and the 1959 Chevrolet Impala. Soaring, sharply pointed, and bearing twin round taillights, they engendered a backlash against the look. Tailfins descended throughout the early 1960s, even adopting a downward slope on the 1965 Cadillacs. Mostly they disappeared, although in instances <b>a</b> sharp-edged <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> meeting <b>a</b> downward sloping trunk created the look if not illusion of fins. Vestigial tailfins, however, remained on American cars into the 1990s, {{at least as far}} as the 1999 Cadillac Deville.|$|R
40|$|By {{collecting}} annual {{economic and}} demographic {{information from a}} large and representative sample of U. S. households for over <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> century, the <b>Panel</b> Study of Income Dynamics has compiled a remarkably useful set of microdata. This article describes the PSID and how its unique longitudinal and, in some cases, intergenerational features {{have been used for}} studies of intertemporal models of labor supply; wages, employment, and job tenure; consumption; poverty dynamics; extended-family behavior; and the intergenerational transmission of economic status. ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1966, Dodge {{took the}} Charger into NASCAR {{in hopes that}} the {{fastback}} would make their car a winner on the high-banks. However the car proved difficult to handle on the faster tracks because its body generated lift. Drivers would later claim that [...] "it was like driving on ice." [...] To solve this problem Dodge installed a small lip spoiler on the trunk lid that improved traction at speeds above [...] This was made a dealer-installed option in late-1966 and in 1967 because of NASCAR rules, making the '66 Charger the first U.S. production vehicle to offer <b>a</b> spoiler. (Small <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> extensions were added in 1967.) [...] David Pearson, driving a #6 Cotton Owens-prepared Charger, {{went on to win}} the NASCAR Grand National championship in 1966 with 14 first-place finishes.|$|R
40|$|International audienceRun- 2 of the LHC is {{providing}} new challenges {{to track and}} vertex reconstruction imposed by the higher collision energy, pileup and luminosity that are being delivered. The ATLAS tracking performance relies critically on the Pixel Detector, therefore, in view of Run- 2 of LHC, the ATLAS experiment has constructed the first 4 -layer Pixel detector in HEP, installing a new Pixel layer, also called Insertable B-Layer (IBL). Pixel detector was refurbished with <b>a</b> new service <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> to recover about 3 % of defective modules lost during run- 1 and an additional optical link per module was added to overcome in some layers the readout bandwidth limitation when LHC will exceed the nominal peak luminosity by almost a factor of 3. The key features and challenges met during the IBL project will be presented, {{as well as its}} operational experience and Pixel Detector performance in LHC...|$|R

50|$|The Carriage Roof option (still only {{available}} in white canvas-embossed vinyl; but now standard on Bill Blass Designer Series) received new interior rear <b>quarter</b> trim <b>panel</b> inserts (<b>a</b> blanked off, color-keyed padded vinyl insert filler panel covering {{the area where}} the deleted opera windows were - with round (non-switch-operated) reading/courtesy lights in the center of these panels on each side; thus effectively replacing 1978's rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> vanity mirrors). These new interior <b>quarter</b> trim <b>panel</b> inserts would also appear on the Collector's Series, (in color-keyed vinyl, or cloth - depending on the seat trim color) as the exterior landau roof design also eliminated the opera windows on this model. Here, though, the reading/courtesy lights in these <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> inserts had control switches above the rear seat quarter armrests, to allow them to operate as customary door-jamb activated interior courtesy lights, as well as rear seat passengers being able to switch them on and off independently as true reading lamps.|$|R
5000|$|At {{launch in}} April 1985, the TM series {{included}} the following models: the base GLX, the mid-range SE and the high-end Elite. August 1986 saw the range expanded with a better-than-GLX equipped model known as the [...] "Executive". Aimed at fleet buyers, this new variant added full plastic wheel coverings, standard power steering and manual or automatic transmission with air conditioning as the sole option. The luxury-oriented models—SE and Elite—featured higher equipment: seats were covered in velour trim with the driver's seat being seven-way adjustable (instead of four-way); lumbar support for driver and passenger; rear integrated headrests and folding centre armrest with boot access; map lights and remote boot release; power windows, central locking and alloy wheels (standard on Elite and optional on SE); metallic paint standard (two-tone standard on Elite and single-tone optional on Elite and SE); radio/cassette players (featuring a novel security system {{that would make the}} unit completely inoperable in the event that its power was disconnected) with the Elite also adding <b>a</b> rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> electric antenna, separate equaliser and steering wheel controls. In addition, instead of standard control steering stalks and ventilation panel on the centre console, both the SE and Elite had two steering side pods, thus bringing all major controls within a driver's fingertips and making them jointly height adjustable with the steering column. Elite also featured an LCD instrument panel, in line with the Japanese automotive trend in the late 1980s. Common to all models were a tilt adjustable steering and cable-operated fuel filler door release. Non-Elite models also had a roof mounted manual antenna above the right A-pillar and the following optional equipment: air conditioning (GLX, Executive and SE), power steering and automatic transmission (GLX and SE).|$|R
40|$|Run- 2 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) {{will provide}} new {{challenges}} {{to track and}} vertex reconstruction with higher energies, denser jets and higher rates. Therefore the ATLAS experiment has constructed the first 4 -layer Pixel detector in HEP, installing a new Pixel layer, also called Insertable B-Layer (IBL). The IBL is a fourth layer of pixel detectors, and has been installed in May 2014 at a radius of 3. 3 cm between the existing Pixel Detector and a new smaller radius beam-pipe. The new detector, built {{to cope with the}} high radiation and expected occupancy, is the first large scale application of 3 D detectors and CMOS 130 ~nm technology. In addition, the Pixel detector was refurbished with <b>a</b> new service <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> to recover about 3 % of defective modules lost during Run- 1 and a new optical readout system to readout the data at higher speed while reducing the occupancy when running with increased luminosity. Complementing detector improvements, many improvements to Inner Detector track and vertex reconstruction were developed during the two year shutdown of the LHC. These include novel techniques developed to improve the performance in the dense cores of jets, optimisation for the expected conditions, and a software campaign which lead to a factor of three decrease in the CPU time needed to process each recorded event...|$|R

CVED currently uses only the Chevrolet Tahoe. Starting in 2008, CVED moved to the Tahoe platform and began using the same paint scheme as the Troopers' vehicle. The words [...] "Commercial Vehicle Enforcement" [...] were added to the <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> and the 'Motor Carrier Enforcement' decals on the rear were replaced with standard [...] "State Police" [...] decals.|$|R
40|$|Sandwich panels with auxetic lattice cores {{confined}} between metallic facets {{are proposed}} for localised impact resistance applications. Their performance under localised impact is numerically studied, considering the rate-dependent effects. The behaviour of the composite structure material at high strain rates is modelled with the Johnson-Cook model. Parametric analyses are conducted {{to assess the}} performance of different designs of the hybrid composite structures. The results are compared with monolithic panels of equivalent areal mass and material in terms of deformations and plastic energy dissipation. Design parameters considered for the parametric analyses include the auxetic unit cell effective Poisson’s ratio, thickness of the facet, material properties and radius of the unit cell’s struts. Significant reduction in computational time is achieved by modelling <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> of the <b>panel,</b> with shell elements for facets and beam elements for the auxetic core. With projectile impacts up to 200 [*]m/s, the auxetic composite panels {{are found to be}} able to absorb a similar amount of energy through plastic deformation, while the maximum back facet displacements are reduced up to 56 % due to localised densification and plastic deformation of the auxetic core.

A divided shield is blazoned [...] "party per of division" [...] or [...] "parted per of division", though the word [...] "party" [...] or [...] "parted" [...] is almost always omitted (e.g. [...] "Per pale argent and vert, a tree eradicated counterchanged"). A tincture is sometimes replaced by [...] "of the first", [...] "of the second" [...] etc. to avoid repetition of tincture names; they refer to the order in which the tinctures were first mentioned. [...] "Counterchanged" [...] means that a charge which straddles a line of division is tinctured of the same tinctures as the divided field, reversed (see Behnsdorf arms pictured above).|$|R
