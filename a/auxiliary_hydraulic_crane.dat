40|$|Generally, {{pressure}} oscillation has {{negative effect on}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>crane</b> system which requires high dynamic stability under a flexible operating condition. In {{order to reduce the}} hydraulic {{pressure oscillation}}, a self-tuning fuzzy proportional–integral–derivative control strategy is proposed for improving the control performance of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>crane.</b> In this article, a fuzzy proportional–integral–derivative controller which consists of a proportional–integral–derivative controller and a fuzzy inference unit with two inputs and three outputs is designed for valve control. Both fuzzy proportional–integral–derivative control and traditional proportional–integral–derivative control are simulated using MATLAB based on the model of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>crane.</b> Simulation experiments are conducted with different crane tip velocities. The experimental results show that pressure amplitude reduced about 25 % at low velocity and pressure oscillation of hydraulic cylinder is suppressed comparing with traditional proportional–integral–derivative controller. In addition, fuzzy proportional–integral–derivative control enables a smoother variation and a higher accuracy in changing processes of joint angle and crane tip position. The performance of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>crane</b> is improved...|$|R
50|$|Depending {{upon the}} vehicle, whether an excavator, a back-hoe or a front-end-loader, the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>hydraulic</b> system may vary. Vehicle {{interface}} fittings, length from pump to attachment and vehicle control systems require various configurations of an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>hydraulic</b> system. <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>hydraulic</b> systems usually include external fluid fittings to facilitate connecting and disconnecting the {{hydraulic fluid supply}} lines of the attachments to the vehicles' hydraulic pump. They also usually include valves configured to control the supply of hydraulic fluid through the fittings.|$|R

50|$|The {{success of}} his <b>hydraulic</b> <b>crane</b> led Armstrong to {{establish}} the Elswick works at Newcastle, to produce his <b>hydraulic</b> machinery for <b>cranes</b> and bridges in 1847.

The company expanded from a workforce of 300 and an annual production of 45 cranes in 1850, to almost 4,000 workers producing over 100 cranes per year by the early 1860s.|$|R

A duty cycle of 3 minutes on and a cooling period of 20 minutes off is required to avoid overheating the pump motor.|$|R
