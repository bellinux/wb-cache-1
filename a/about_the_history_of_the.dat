5|$|David's {{first five}} books, {{particularly}} the earlier works, contained recipes interspersed with literary quotation {{and descriptions of}} people and places that inspired her. By {{the time of her}} third book, Italian Food, David had begun to add sections <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cuisine and the particular dishes that she wrote about. Her interest in the history of cooking led her in her later years to research the history of spices, baking, and ice.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oldest exposed {{rocks in the}} area due to {{extensive}} metamorphism (alteration of rock by heat and pressure). Radiometric dating gives an age of 1,700million years for the metamorphism during the Proterozoic. About 1,400million years ago a mass of granite now in the Panamint Range intruded this complex. Uplift later exposed these rocks to nearly 500million years of erosion.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 7th century, southern England was almost entirely {{under the control of the}} Anglo-Saxons. These peoples, who are known to have included Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians, began to arrive in Britain in the 5th century. By 600, a number of kingdoms had begun to form in the conquered territories, including the Kingdom of the East Angles, an Anglo-Saxon kingdom which today includes the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. Almost no documentary sources exist <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kingdom before the reign of Rædwald, who reigned until about 624. Sources of information include the names of a few of the early Wuffing kings, mentioned in a short passage in Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, written in the 730s.|$|E
5|$|Eaton Hall is {{a private}} {{residence}} and is not open to the public, but the gardens are open three days each year {{to raise money for}} charity. In the area of the Stable Court are a number of rooms which are used for exhibitions. The Carriage Museum holds the Westminster Collection of Carriages. The Exhibition Room houses a collection of items relating to the Grosvenor family, and the History Room contains items <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family and illustrations of the hall at various stages in the past. The Stables include items relating to the family's horses. In the garden, the Parrot House contains an exhibition of paintings by the Victorian artist Henry Stacy Marks.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oldest exposed {{rocks in the}} area due to {{extensive}} metamorphism; the rock has been pressure-cooked. This somber, gray, almost featureless crystalline complex is composed of originally sedimentary and igneous rocks with large quantities of quartz and feldspar mixed in. The original rocks were transformed to contorted schist and gneiss, making their original parentage almost unrecognizable. Radiometric dating gives an age of 1700 million years for the metamorphism, placing it {{in the early part}} of the Proterozoic eon.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} glorifies {{this event}} in Poland's past and its culture, and {{the majesty of}} its kings. At the same time, the painting has darker undertones, reflecting the troubled times that befell Poland {{in the late eighteenth}} century, for the Kingdom of Prussia would become one of the partitioning powers that ended the independence of Poland. The painting was seen by some as anti-Prussian, foretelling its perceived betrayal of Poland; others have noted it is also critical of Poland, as Matejko included signs that signify this seemingly triumphant moment was a hollow, wasted victory. Matejko created his painting to remind others <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> no-longer-independent country he loved, and about the changing fates of history. The painting is counted among his masterpieces.|$|E
5|$|Bede {{also had}} correspondents who {{supplied}} him with material. Albinus, the abbot {{of the monastery}} in Canterbury, provided much information about the church in Kent, and {{with the assistance of}} Nothhelm, at that time a priest in London, obtained copies of Gregory the Great's correspondence from Rome relating to Augustine's mission. Almost all of Bede's information regarding Augustine is taken from these letters. Bede acknowledged his correspondents in the preface to the Historia Ecclesiastica; he was in contact with Daniel, the Bishop of Winchester, for information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church in Wessex, and also wrote to the monastery at Lastingham for information about Cedd and Chad. Bede also mentions an Abbot Esi as a source for the affairs of the East Anglian church, and Bishop Cynibert for information about Lindsey.|$|E
5|$|Doggett {{returns to}} the X-Files office, where, to his surprise, he meets The Lone Gunmen. They tell him <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third eye.

Returning to the warehouse where they found Bormanis, Skinner and Doggett meet Tipet, {{who is trying to}} take his own life by pushing his head through a table saw. They rush him to the hospital, where Doggett by surprise finds Scully's name on the register. With Tipet in a coma, Kersh decides to pull the plug on the case, saying they've found the main suspect. But Doggett and Skinner are not satisfied, saying there are no explanations for the various murders and events surrounding the case.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, a six-foot slab of {{fiberglass}} {{from the}} imitation wax {{at the top}} of the candle was knocked loose by 50 mile-per-hour winds during a storm. Nobody was injured. James Pruznick, a filmmaker from Pohatcong Township, New Jersey, made a documentary film in 2004 focused on that year's assembly of the Peace Candle, as well as interviews with politicians, artists, merchants and construction workers <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure. It was first screened in December 2004 and made available subsequently on VHS and DVD. In October 2008, fear grew that the Peace Candle would no longer be erected when Easton employees who previously volunteer to climb the Peace Candle structure no longer wished to assemble it. Those fears were put to rest the next month, however, when the trade union Lehigh Valley Erectors Inc. volunteered to put the candle up.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> East Saxons during the 8th century, but what {{evidence}} there is indicates that both London and Middlesex, {{which had been}} part of the kingdom of Essex, were finally brought under Mercian control during the reign of Æthelbald. Both Æthelbald and Offa granted land in Middlesex and London as they wished; in 767 a charter of Offa's disposed of land in Harrow without a local ruler as witness. It is likely that both London and Middlesex were quickly under Offa's control at the start of his reign. The East Saxon royal house survived the 8th century, so it is probable that the kingdom of Essex retained its native rulers, but under strong Mercian influence, for most or all of the 8th century.|$|E
