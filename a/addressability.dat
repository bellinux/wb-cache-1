50|$|One {{problem with}} {{conventional}} <b>Addressability</b> systems {{is that the}} information received by the <b>Addressability</b> server has already been packaged for a specific controller. Controllers are limited {{in the number of}} hardware links they can support. Because packaged information received by the <b>Addressability</b> server is controller specific, and due to hardware limitations, a dedicated link is required between the <b>Addressability</b> server and the controller. Since the number of links for a controller are limited, the <b>Addressability</b> system can only support a limited number of controller types. The limit on the supportable controller links, together with the hardware limitations, also results in limits on the number of priority levels which can be accepted by a given controller. Therefore, prior <b>Addressability</b> systems are limited in their hardware and software scalability.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Addressability</b> {{system may}} be viewed as the {{interface}} between the billing system or BSS/OSS and the controller. Known <b>Addressability</b> systems receive information from the billing system and send it to the appropriate controller to enable the controller to properly configure the converter. A conventional <b>Addressability</b> systems may include an <b>Addressability</b> server linked to the billing system. The <b>Addressability</b> server receives information from the billing system and passes it to controller processors, which forward the information to the appropriate controller. Known systems are hardware driven and the packaging of enabling information is integrated with the billing system. The billing system gathers data corresponding to the customer and request. Then packages the data into a format for a particular type of controller. Different types of controllers include, for example, controllers manufactured by General Instrument(GI), Motorola, Jerrold, Scientific Atlanta, Zenith, Tocom and Oak.|$|E

Within the field of cable television or CATV, for example, an <b>Addressability</b> System or Addressable System may enable and control the distribution of cable services, creating a conditional access system (CAS), and allow the cable system to control and administer which cable products a customer may purchase and/or view.|$|E

50|$|Storage {{technologies}} at {{all levels}} of the storage hierarchy can be differentiated by evaluating certain core characteristics as well as measuring characteristics specific to a particular implementation.

5000|$|The {{instruction}} set architecture {{was adapted from}} the LINC, the only significant change was toexpand addressable memory to 4K, which required addition of an origin register. It was an accumulator machine with 12-bit addresses to manipulate 12-bit data. Later versions included [...] "origin registers" [...] {{that were used to}} extend the <b>addressability</b> of memory. Arithmetic was one's complement.|$|E

50|$|All PICs handle (and address) data in 8-bit chunks. However, {{the unit}} of <b>addressability</b> of the code space is not {{generally}} {{the same as the}} data space. For example, PICs in the baseline (PIC12) and mid-range (PIC16) families have program memory addressable in the same wordsize as the instruction width, i.e. 12 or 14 bits respectively. In contrast, in the PIC18 series, the program memory is addressed in 8-bit increments (bytes), which differs from the instruction width of 16 bits.|$|E
50|$|<b>Addressability</b> is {{the ability}} of a digital device to {{individually}} respond to a message sent to many similar devices. Examples include pagers, mobile phones and set-top boxes for pay TV. Computer networks are also addressable, such as via the MAC address on Ethernet network cards, and similar networking protocols like Bluetooth. This allows data to be sent in cases where it is impractical (or impossible, such as with wireless devices) to control exactly where or to which devices the message is physically sent.|$|E
50|$|PICs {{have a set}} of {{registers}} {{that function}} as general-purpose RAM. Special-purpose control registers for on-chip hardware resources are also mapped into the data space. The <b>addressability</b> of memory varies depending on device series, and all PIC devices have some banking mechanism to extend addressing to additional memory. Later series of devices feature move instructions, which can cover the whole addressable space, independent of the selected bank. In earlier devices, any register move had to be achieved through the accumulator.|$|E

Display resolution was 160&times;160 pixels, throttled down from 192&times;200 allowed by the 6560 chip, in order to permit per-pixel <b>addressability.</b> Multicolor hi-res was supported (with a resolution of 80&times;160) and could be mixed with normal hi-res.|$|E

Visible World has developed tech stack that enables advertisers, advertising agencies and media companies to deliver programmatic, addressable, and measurable ads. The company’s addressable distribution platform enables the delivery of targeted advertising to increase consumer relevance and engagement.

50|$|The 6501 and 6502 have 40-pin DIP packages; the 6503, 6504, 6505, and 6507 are 28-pin DIP versions, for reduced {{chip and}} circuit board cost. In the 28-pin versions, the pin count {{is reduced by}} leaving {{off some of the}} {{high-order}} address pins and various combinations of function pins, making those functions unavailable. Typically, the 12 pins omitted are the three N.C. pins, one of the two Vss pins, one of the clock pins, the SYNC pin, the S.O. pin, either the maskable interrupt or the NMI, and the four most-significant address lines (A12 - A15) are the 12 pins omitted to reduce the pin count from 40 to 28. The omission of four address pins reduces the external <b>addressability</b> to 4 KB (from the 64 KB of the 6502), though the internal PC register and all effective address calculations remain 16-bit. The 6507 omits both interrupt pins in order to include address line A12, providing 8 KB of external <b>addressability</b> but no interrupt capability. The 6507 was used in the popular Atari 2600 video game console, the design of which divides the 8 KB memory space in half, allocating the lower half to the console's internal RAM and peripherals the upper half to the Game Cartridge&trade;, so Atari 2600 cartridges have a 4 KB address limit (and the same capacity limit unless the cartridge contains bank switching circuitry).|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} C is {{closely tied to}} the {{development}} of the Unix operating system, originally implemented in assembly language on a PDP-7 by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson, incorporating several ideas from colleagues. Eventually, they decided to port the operating system to a PDP-11. The original PDP-11 version of Unix was developed in assembly language. The developers were considering rewriting the system using the B language, Thompson's simplified version of BCPL. However B's inability to take advantage of some of the PDP-11's features, notably byte <b>addressability,</b> led to C. The name of C was chosen simply as the next after B.|$|E
5000|$|With subpixel {{rendering}} technology, {{the number}} of points that may be independently addressed to reconstruct the image is increased. When the green subpixels are reconstructing the shoulders, the red subpixels are reconstructing near the peaks and vice versa. For text fonts, increasing the <b>addressability</b> allows the font designer to use spatial frequencies and phases that would have created noticeable distortions had it been whole pixel rendered. The improvement is most noted on italic fonts which exhibit different phases on each row. This reduction in moiré distortion is the primary benefit of subpixel rendered fonts on the conventional [...] Stripe panel.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{multiple}} tools included with Valgrind (and several external ones). The default (and most used) tool is Memcheck. Memcheck inserts extra instrumentation code around almost all instructions, which {{keeps track of}} the validity (all unallocated memory starts as invalid or [...] "undefined", until it is initialized into a deterministic state, possibly from other memory) and <b>addressability</b> (whether the memory address in question points to an allocated, non-freed memory block), stored in the so-called V bits and A bits, respectively. As data is moved around or manipulated, the instrumentation code keeps track of the A and V bits so they are always correct on a single-bit level.|$|E
50|$|Polyhedra IMDB runs in 32-bit mode on Linux (first ported to this {{platform}} in 1995), Windows (since 1995), and Solaris (1994); if {{the operating system}} is running in 64-bit mode, the 64-bit version of Polyhedra IMDB (also known as Polyhedra64) will also run on the platform, which gives greater memory <b>addressability</b> and thus greater capacity.
