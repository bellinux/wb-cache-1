5|$|Other {{advantages}} of using an electric fire engine were {{that it would}} not produce loud noises, smoke, dust, cinders <b>and</b> <b>ashes,</b> as steam fire engines did. Also, the cost of an electric fire engine would be about one-third that of a steam boiler fire engine. A typical electric fire engine weighed sixty percent less than a steam boiler of the same capacity.|$|E
5|$|The Tzotzil Maya of {{highland}} Chiapas used spears, thrown rocks, {{bows and}} arrows, and large flexible cotton shields that protected the warrior {{from head to}} foot and could be rolled up for storage. Towns were sometimes defended with walls and barricades, built from packed earth and stone, and reinforced with tree trunks. Defenders would hurl stones down from above, or pour boiling water mixed with lime <b>and</b> <b>ashes</b> upon attackers. As the Spanish became established in Chiapas, indigenous resistance took the form of flight to inaccessible regions.|$|E

40|$|Disposal of mud <b>and</b> <b>ash,</b> {{particularly}} in wet weather conditions, {{is a significant}} expense for mills. This paper reports on part of a process to pelletise mud <b>and</b> <b>ash,</b> aimed at making mud <b>and</b> <b>ash</b> more attractive to growers across entire mill districts. The full process and the re-constituting and centrifuging rotary vacuum filter mud {{part of the process}} were described in two papers to the 2011 conference. The component described in this paper involves aspects of mixing mud <b>and</b> <b>ash</b> with subsequent drying using boiler exit gas. The mud material needs to mix easily with boiler <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> the mixture has to feed easily into and be pneumatically conveyed by a flue gas dryer. The performance of a pilot flue gas dryer for drying mud <b>and</b> <b>ash</b> was evaluated. The mud <b>and</b> <b>ash</b> mixture was found to dry much faster than final bagasse, provided the mud <b>and</b> <b>ash</b> material was broken up into individual particles. A previously developed computer model of bagasse drying was updated {{to take into account the}} smaller particle size of the mud <b>and</b> <b>ash</b> mixture. This upgraded model predicted the performance of the pilot flue gas dryer well...|$|R
5|$|While the {{painting}} {{has been described}} as showing the story of an ancestral being called Lungkata starting the first bushfire, it portrays elements of nine distinct dreamings, of which Lungkata's tale is the central motif. Lungkata was the Bluetongue Lizard Man, an ancestral figure responsible for creating bushfire. The painting portrays the results of a fire, caused by Lungkata to punish his two sons who did not share with their father the kangaroo they had caught. The sons' skeletons are on the right hand side of the image, shown against a background representing smoke <b>and</b> <b>ashes.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the century, the palette had {{expanded}} to include red, black, green, yellow, and gray which signifies different aspects of the earth as defined by different locations of the reservation. Navajo used indigo to obtain shades from pale blue to near black and mixed it with indigenous yellow dyes such as the rabbit brush plant to obtain bright green effects. Red was the most difficult dye to obtain locally. Early Navajo textiles use cochineal, an extract from a Mesoamerican beetle, which often made a circuitous trade route through Spain and England {{on its way to the}} Navajo. Reds used in Navajo weaving tended to be raveled from imported textiles. The Navajo obtained black dye through pi√±on pitch <b>and</b> <b>ashes.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2006, riots {{broke out}} {{following}} {{the election of}} Snyder Rini as Prime Minister, destroying part of Chinatown and displacing more than 1,000 Chinese residents; the large Pacific Casino Hotel was also totally gutted. The commercial heart of Honiara was virtually reduced to rubble <b>and</b> <b>ashes.</b> Three National Parliament members, Charles Dausabea, Nelson Ne'e, and Patrick Vahoe, were arrested during or {{as a result of}} the riots. The Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), the 16-country Pacific Islands Forum initiative set up in 2003 with assistance from Australia, intervened, sending in additional police and army officers to bring the situation under control. A vote of no confidence was passed against the Prime Minister. Following his resignation, a five-party Grand Coalition for Change Government was formed in May 2006, with Manasseh Sogavare as Prime Minister, quelling the riots and running the government. The army part of RAMSI was removed and rebuilding took shape.|$|E

5|$|Prone to {{downtime}} due to Keenan's other musical commitments, {{among other}} things, the band has featured {{a variety of}} musicians in the other roles throughout its alternating periods of activity and inactivity. The original incarnation of the band included Paz Lenchantin on bass, Troy Van Leeuwen on guitar, and Josh Freese on drums; though Primus drummer Tim Alexander had briefly stood in as a drummer prior to Freese in the band's initial live shows prior to releasing any material. Band collaborator and producer Danny Lohner and Marilyn Manson bassist Jeordie White were also members {{for a short period}} in the early 2000s. The band's current lineup features former Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha, bassist Matt McJunkins, and drummer Jeff Friedl, the latter two also being contributors to the related Puscifer <b>and</b> <b>Ashes</b> Divide projects. Despite the varied cast and numerous lineup changes, the stylistic content of the songs has remained consistent with Howerdel as music composer, and Keenan penning the lyrics and vocal melodies. The band's studio albums have been generally well received critically and commercially, with their three studio albums selling 4 million copies collectively as of 2005.|$|E

40|$|Trithorax (TRX) <b>and</b> <b>ASH</b> 1 {{belong to}} the trithorax group (trxG) of {{transcriptional}} activator proteins, which maintains homeotic gene expression during Drosophila development. TRX <b>and</b> <b>ASH</b> 1 are localized on chromosomes and share several homologous domains with other chromatin-associated proteins, including a highly conserved SET domain and PHD fingers. Based on genetic interactions between trx <b>and</b> <b>ash</b> 1 <b>and</b> our previous observation that association of the TRX protein with polytene chromosomes is ash 1 dependent, we investigated {{the possibility of a}} physical linkage between the two proteins. We found that the endogenous TRX <b>and</b> <b>ASH</b> 1 proteins coimmunoprecipitate from embryonic extracts and colocalize on salivary gland polytene chromosomes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TRX <b>and</b> <b>ASH</b> 1 bind in vivo to a relatively small (4 kb) bxd subregion of the homeotic gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx), which contains several trx response elements. Analysis of the effects of ash 1 mutations on the activity of this regulatory region indicates that it also contains ash 1 response element(s). This suggests that <b>ASH</b> 1 <b>and</b> TRX act on Ubx in relatively close proximity to each other. Finally, TRX <b>and</b> <b>ASH</b> 1 appear to interact directly through their conserved SET domains, based on binding assays in vitro and in yeast and on coimmunoprecipitation assays with embryo extracts. Collectively, these results suggest that TRX <b>and</b> <b>ASH</b> 1 are components that interact either within trxG protein complexes or between complexes that act in close proximity on regulatory DNA to maintain Ubx transcription...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of three particle sizes of feedstock and two types of novel bale wraps on the quality of switchgrass by monitoring the chemical changes in cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, extractives, <b>and</b> <b>ash</b> over a 225 -day period. Using NIR (Near-infrared) modeling to predict the chemical composition of the treated biomass, differences were found in cellulose, lignin, <b>and</b> <b>ash</b> content across switchgrass bales with different particle sizes. Enclosing bales in a net and film impacted the cellulose, lignin, <b>and</b> <b>ash</b> content. Cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, extractives, <b>and</b> <b>ash</b> were different across the 225 -day storage period. A quadratic response function made better prediction about cellulose, lignin, <b>and</b> <b>ash</b> response to storage, and a linear response function best described hemicellulose and extractives response to storage. This study yields valuable information regarding the quality of switchgrass at different intervals between the start and end date of storage, which is important to conversion facilities when determining optimal storage strategies to improve quality of the biomass feedstock, based on potential output yield of a bale over time...|$|R
