25|$|Vitamin B1 or {{thiamine}} {{is present}} at a concentration between 0.2 and 0.5 milligrams per litre. This vitamin {{is necessary for}} the proper growth of yeasts that ensure alcoholic fermentation. In the must of healthy grapes the natural quantity is sufficient for the yeast. On the other hand, for a degraded harvest (by gray mold), the degradation of this vitamin leads the winemaker to <b>add</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> must to ensure a trouble-free fermentation. In the case of a harvest with a very clear wort and low temperature the yeast works in a limited way and the addition of thiamine can help avoid a difficult end of fermentation. Legislation limits the amount added to 30 milligrams per hectolitre.|$|E
25|$|For example, in most {{motion control}} systems, {{in order to}} {{accelerate}} a mechanical load under control, more force is required from the actuator. If a velocity loop PID controller {{is being used to}} control the speed of the load and command the force being applied by the actuator, then it is beneficial to take the desired instantaneous acceleration, scale that value appropriately and <b>add</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> output of the PID velocity loop controller. This means that whenever the load is being accelerated or decelerated, a proportional amount of force is commanded from the actuator regardless of the feedback value. The PID loop in this situation uses the feedback information to change the combined output to reduce the remaining difference between the process setpoint and the feedback value. Working together, the combined open-loop feed-forward controller and closed-loop PID controller can provide a more responsive control system.|$|E

Parts of the interchange with SR94 were open by July20. The City of Chula Vista considered SR 125 as possibly having scenic value when constructed, and considered asking the state to <b>add</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state highway system; this influenced a rule that construction projects near possible scenic routes in the city had to take natural aesthetics into account.

500|$|Experience of the German 1st Army in the Somme Battles, (Erfahrungen der I Armee in der Sommeschlacht) was {{published}} on 30 January 1917. Ludendorff's new defensive methods had been controversial; during the Battle of the Somme in 1916 Colonel Fritz von Loßberg (Chief of Staff of the 1st Army) {{had been able}} to establish a line of relief divisions , with the reinforcements from Verdun, which began to arrive in greater numbers in September. In his analysis of the battle, Fritz von Loßberg opposed the granting of discretion to front trench garrisons to retire, as he believed that manoeuvre did not allow the garrisons to evade Allied artillery fire, which could blanket the forward area and invited enemy infantry to occupy vacant areas. Loßberg considered that spontaneous withdrawals would disrupt the counter-attack reserves as they deployed and further deprive battalion and division commanders of the ability to conduct an organised defence, which the dispersal of infantry over a wider area had already made difficult. Loßberg and others had severe doubts as to the ability of relief divisions to arrive on the battlefield in time to conduct an immediate counter-attack [...] from behind the battle zone. The sceptics wanted the Somme practice of fighting in the front line to be retained and authority devolved no further than battalion, so as to maintain organizational coherence, in anticipation of a methodical counter-attack [...] after [...] by the relief divisions. Ludendorff was sufficiently impressed by Loßberg's memorandum to <b>add</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new Manual of Infantry Training for War.|$|E
500|$|The track segues {{directly}} into [...] "What's My Age Again?", also penned by Hoppus, who created it partially {{as a joke}} to amuse friends. It was originally titled [...] "Peter Pan Complex", referencing the subject matter: one who refuses to grow up. [...] "Dysentery Gary" [...] leads off {{the second half of}} the album, and was written by DeLonge about a crush that instead chooses someone else. Left with [...] "nothing better to do," [...] the devastated friend chooses to mock her boyfriend. It was one of the first songs the band wrote with Barker, who incorporated a [...] "Latin groove" [...] into his drumming. [...] "Adam's Song," [...] the piano-laced seventh track of the record, was written primarily based on the loneliness that Hoppus experienced during the unending days of touring the previous year. When Hoppus brought the song to the band, the trio reacted positively but showed reluctance to <b>add</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> record, believing the dark subject matter might off-put listeners. Although usually vocals would take many alternate takes to complete, Hoppus completed the vocal track for [...] "Adam's Song" [...] in a single take. The power pop-inspired [...] "All the Small Things" [...] was composed by DeLonge as both an ode to his girlfriend and one of his favorite bands, the Ramones. During the recording process of Enema of the State, DeLonge came home to find roses at the top of the stairs from his girlfriend, which inspired the line: [...] "She left me roses by the stairs; surprises let me know she cares." ...|$|E

2500|$|In one respect, the Eastern Orthodox Church's {{received}} {{text of the}} Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed {{differs from}} the earliest text, which {{is included in the}} acts of the Council of Chalcedon of 451: The Eastern Orthodox Church uses the singular forms of verbs such as [...] "I believe", in place of the plural form ("we believe") used by the council.

These rings are used as a form of currency, and are backed by fixed volumes of water (analogous to the historical gold standard). For example, the victor of a sanctioned duel would claim his dead opponent's water, and the widow or children of deceased Fremen might inherit his water. Water rings have a profound significance in matters of birth, death, and courtship ritual.|$|E
