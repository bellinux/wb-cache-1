40|$|Abstract: The {{voluntary}} counselling <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> lay counsellors are not {{employees of}} the City of Johannesburg at Region F, but rather receive stipend money as an incentive from the non-governmental organisations. The voluntary counselling <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> lay counsellors seem to be unhappy and dissatisfied about their functions as demonstrated by their irregular attendance at the voluntary counselling <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> sites. It became difficult for the voluntary counselling <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> clients to access the voluntary counselling <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> service {{in the absence of}} the voluntary counselling <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> lay counsellors as they had to wait in the long queues in order to be attended to by the professional nurses. In most instances, the voluntary counselling <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> clients decided rather to leave the clinics without being attended to. The purpose of this study was to explore and describe the lived experiences of the voluntary counselling <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> lay counsellors <b>and</b> professional nurses with regard to voluntary counselling <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> services offered in the City of Johannesburg at Region F. To address the problem a contextual, qualitative, exploratory, and descriptive phenomenological, research design was used in this study. A purposive sampling method was used. Individual, in-depth, phenomenological, semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect data. The interviews were directed by two open-ended research questions. A model of trustworthiness with four components namely, credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability was followed. An open coding, qualitative data analysis method was used. The ethical considerations were taken into account. The results from the analysis of the transcriptions were described. Three main themes (1) lack of appropriate counselling rooms, (2) increased workload and staff shortages (3) lack of motivation and support and their related sub-themes in table 3. 1 were identified and conceptualised within the existing literature and concluding statements were made. The supporting guidelines to improve the performance of the voluntary counselling <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> lay counsellors in conducting counselling <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> along with the limitations, recommendations, and conclusions of the study were described.
