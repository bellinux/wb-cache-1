Background: The DACS is a recently released active hearing implant that works on the principle of a conventional piston prosthesis driven by the rod of an electromagnetic actuator. An inherent part of the DACS actuator is a thin titanium diaphragm that allows for movement of the stimulation rod while hermetically sealing the housing. In addition to mechanical stimulation, the actuator emits sound into the mastoid cavity because of the motion of the diaphragm. Methods: We investigated the use of the sound emission of a DACS for intra-operative testing. We measured sound emission in the external auditory canal (PEAC) and velocity of the <b>actuators</b> stimulation <b>rod</b> (Vact) in five implanted ears of whole-head specimens.

Simulated implant misplacement or malfunction could be detected by the absence or shift in the characteristic resonance frequency of the actuator.

METHODS: The aim was to study the deployment of an implant dedicated to the vertebral augmentation by percutaneous approach (kyphoplasty). Its kinematics and the related forces have been investigated. A theoretical model of deployment has been proposed and the ancillary was instrumented with strain gauges and Hall effect sensors to measure kinematics and force in the deployment <b>actuator</b> (tensile <b>rod).</b> The methodology was first evaluated ex-vivo in a test-bench with boundary conditions monitored by a tensile machine. Then, a cadaver study was carried out in three lumbar and thoracic vertebral segments of normal and osteoporotic spines. FINDINGS: The relationships between ancillary internal forces, deployment, and cranio-caudal pushing force have been obtained. The test-bench experiment showed quasi-proportional relationship between force distribution and kinematics during the deployment. Ex-vivo cranio-caudal pushing forces were measured. Cadaver studies showed cranio-caudal pushing forces comprised between 100 N and 200 N. These forces were dependent upon the implant location in the vertebral body and bone stock. INTERPRETATION: The methodology was related to the analysis of load distribution and kinematics of a deployable implant for vertebral augmentation.

40|$|Line-of-sight {{stabilization}} of an optical instrument using magnetostnctlve actuators {{is described in}} this study. Various stabilization methods, i. e. gyroscopic, hydraulic, piezoelectric, electrodynamic and magnetostrictive methods, are compared and magnetostrictive stabilization is selected for its relatively large stroke length, low input voltage and wide frequency bandwidth. The system makes use of two magnetostrictive actuators, one {{at each end of}} the optical instrument, mounted between the moving base and instrument. Each actuator is equipped with cylindrical rods of Terfenol-D, a highly magnetostrictive material. Field coils are wound around the rods to produce a strain in the rods, thereby exciting angular motion of the instrument. Actuator stroke length is enhanced by means of a hingeless gain mechanism, rod prestressing and field biasing. Dynamic characteristics of the system are modelled to facilitate actuator, coil and control system design. A linear, single-degree-of-freedom actuator model, in state-space and transfer function forms, is derived and coupled to a distributed model of the optical instrument, using the Rayleigh-Ritz method. Transfer functions between actuator coil voltages and instrument angular acceleration are derived. Normal mode shapes, natural frequencies and damping factors are predicted. Design concepts for bias field, prestress, actuator gain and optical instrument support structure, are discussed and the most suitable concepts are selected. The required <b>actuator</b> gain, <b>rod</b> length and diameter, prestress spring stiffness, coil resistance and inductance are calculated. System components are designed in detail and safety of the design is checked. The actuators are characterized quasi-statically to determine the saturation strain, linear range of operation and DC bias field. The system is dynamically characterized to obtain transfer functions between the coil voltage and instrument angular acceleration. The test setups are described and limitations of the setups are discussed. Test results are processed and discussed. A comparison with the modelled results shows that the model is highly inaccurate. Reasons for inaccuracies are given and updating of the model is motivated. An updated model is obtained from the experimental results. The model is divided into electrical and mechanical subsystem models. The SDOF actuator models are replaced with 2 DOF models (one for each actuator) and coupled to the instrument and base models, using substructure synthesis. The electrical and mechanical subsystem models are subsequently coupled. It is shown that the updated system model is considerably more accurate than the original model. A linear, suboptimal, disturbance feedforward plus output feedback controller, with output integral feedback, is designed, implemented and tested. An H 2 optimal controller is designed and modified to improve robustness. The controller model is coupled to that of a suboptimal observer. An output integral feedback loop is added to further improve robustness. The controller is implemented in digital filter form. The test apparatus and procedure are described.

40|$|In recent years, a {{great deal}} of {{interest}} has been oriented towards hydraulic systems which are energy efficient, responsive (tracking), and accurate. The traditional approach to achieving responsive and accurate positioning performance is to use a servo valve actuator and position and/or velocity feedback. An alternate positioning system is an electrohydraulic actuation system (EHA), in which the fluid from the hydraulic motor is directed back to the inlet of the pump. Changing the swashplate angle or varying the prime mover shaft speed varies the flow to the hydraulic actuator (linear or rotary) which in turn is used to control the positioning or speed of the load. Because there are no major losses associated with throttling of the fluid, power losses are minimized. In earlier EHA systems, the actuator was limited to that of a rotary system because of the requirement for symmetry in the flow to and from the motor. Recent design changes to linear single <b>rod</b> <b>actuators</b> have expanded the EHA applications to linear positioning. In addition, a specially designed EHA linear actuator system was shown to be able to position a load to 200 nanometers. However, the ability to track a desired input path was not extensively studied and as such, algorithms to control this high precision EHA system were required; hence this was the motivation for this study. The main objective of the thesis was to develop high performance control schemes for (1) a valve controlled hydraulic positioning control system (HPCS) and (2) a specific precision positioning EHA system and verify their position tracking performance. Control methods that were applied to HPCSs in the past decade were comprehensively reviewed in this dissertation. Many successful control algorithms have been developed for hydraulic transmission systems, however, certain problems such as slip-stick friction, uncertainty and nonlinearity in hydraulic actuators, pumps and valves are not fully addressed. Three control algorithms are considered in this study: (1) H 2 -optimal control, (2) H∞ PI plus feedforward control, and (3) robust sliding mode control. The design processes of these three algorithms were based on discrete-time system models. The first two algorithms were based on linear models of the systems while the third applied nonlinear actuator friction in the system model. These three different control algorithms are developed and implemented using simulations and experiments; in addition, their control performance in terms of position tracking and bandwidth performance are examined...|$|R

The model proposed in this dissertation is a bulk model and describes the behaviour of a magnetostrictive actuator by a system with 4 states. We develop this model using phenomenological arguments following the work done by Jiles and Atherton for describing bulk ferromagnetic hysteresis. The model accounts for magnetic hysteresis; eddy current effects; magneto-elastic effects; inertial effects; and mechanical damping. We show rigorously that the system with the intial state at the origin has a periodic orbit as its $Omega$ limit set. For the bulk ferromagnetic hysteresis model - a simplification of the magnetostrictive model, we show that all trajectories starting within a certain set approach this limit set. It is envisioned that the model will help application engineers to do simulation studies of structures with magnetostrictive actuators. Towards this end, an algorithm is proposed to identify the various parameters in the model. In control applications, one may require the actuator to follow a certain trajectory. The complex rate dependent behaviour of the actuator makes the design of a suitable control law a challenging one. As our system of equations do not model transient effects, they do not model the minor-loop closure property common to ferromagnetic materials. Therefore, the design of control laws making explicit use of the model (without modifications) is not possible. A major reason to use model free approaches to control design is that magnetostrictive actuators seem to have slight variations in their behavior with time. Therefore, we tried to use a direct adaptive control methodology that uses features of our model. The system is now looked at as a relative degree two linear system with set-valued input nonlinearity. Extensions of Eugene Ryan's work on universal tracking for a relative degree one linear system and Morse's work on stablization for relative degree two linear systems were sought. Experimental verification of our method confirmed our intuition about the model structure. Though the tracking results were not very satisfactory due to the presence of sensor noise, the experimental results, nevertheless validate our modeling effort...|$|R

Specimen ORF- 4 was removed from test after 4800 hours of actual operation at 1300 deg F, equivalent to approximately 15, 000 hours of full- power 630 A operation. An estimated 40 percent burnup of the /sup 235 /U atoms occurred. Creep tests on warm-finished fuel sheet have accumulated more than 12, 000 hours at 630 A stress and temperature conditions with no greater than 0. 75 percent plastic creep. Cladding-stock creep tests have surpassed 15, 000 hours at various combinations of stress and temperature with satisfactory results. (auth...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the growing}} {{interest}} {{in the use of}} satellites as a quick and cheap way to access space, is increasing the request of new-concept, lower cost, re-usable and flexible systems. A good answer to such a growing demand is the development of innovative high-performance architectures compatible {{with a wide range of}} platforms and applications and compliant with ECSS standards. The Ph. D. activities start in this frame, as a cooperation between the University “Federico II” of Naples and the Italian Company Carlo Gavazzi Space S. p. A [...] The research work is focused on the design, integration and validation of new-concept satellite equipments, such as a Li-ion modular battery and a magnetic actuator. Starting from an evaluation of the technologies state-of-the-art and from an assessment of the products currently available on the market, the main potential innovative aspects (able to improve the product characteristics while reducing development costs and times) are pointed out. A critical analysis of the potential innovations is carried out, including the description of the benefits, as well as the strategies to manage the drawbacks. The design of both the modular battery and the magnetic actuator is completely ITAR free and characterized by a simple and reversible integration process. It is also worth mentioning that, for the first time, thanks to an Italian research project, an Italian space company presents itself on the space market as an internationally recognized supplier of batteries and magnetic actuators for space applications. The Li-ion battery is modular in the sense that it can satisfy a large number of energy requests for different satellite configurations by simply adding or removing basic elements named “modules”, i. e. it does not need to be re-designed and re-qualified for each mission. Each battery module, including eight Saft MPS 176065 cells, is completely self-standing from a structural, thermal, and electrical point of view. The first flight opportunity for the modular battery is represented by Lares, i. e. a mission of the Italian Space Agency (ASI). Lares is the payload for the qualification flight of Vega launcher. Lares battery has been manufactured and integrated as a proto-flight model and has been submitted to a successful acceptance campaign, including performance, vibration, and thermal tests. The next flight opportunities for the modular battery are the ASI satellite missions Miosat and Prisma, and the ESA mission named Eseo. A very promising future evolution of the modular battery design is represented by a hybrid Li-ion/supercapacitor battery system able to satisfy the requirements of satellite missions characterized by high peak power requests. The integration of supercapacitors with Li-ion cells can increase battery lifetime and significantly reduce the total mass of the energy storage unit. The integration of supercapacitors in the battery system requests for an accurate evaluation of the use of such technology in the space environment and of the impacts on both Electrical Power Subsystem and Spacecraft System design. A magnetic <b>actuator</b> (or torque <b>rod)</b> for satellite applications consists of a cylindrical ferromagnetic rod winded by a copper wire. The current circulating into the wire determines a magnetic dipole moment interacting with the earth magnetic flux density. This interaction produces a mechanical torque for satellite attitude control. The equipment, designed in the frame of the Ph. D. activities, is characterized by a simple and highly-reversible integration process thanks to an innovative housing and to a non-elastomeric thermal filler. The magnetic core has been selected as an off-the-shelf (non-custom) ferromagnetic alloy, minimizing procurement times and minimum order quantity. The design process, taking into account the demagnetizing field as function of the core shape, follows three main steps: the first is the definition of the core geometry, the second is the selection of the core material, and the third is the sizing of the winding. The actuator design has been preliminary verified by a numerical simulation and successfully validated by a full qualification campaign including performance, vibration, and thermal tests. Part of the Ph. D. work has been also dedicated to the sizing of the Electrical Power Subsystem (including the Li-ion modular battery as energy storage unit) for different ASI/ESA missions and to further spacecraftlevel system activities such as the integration of a telecom payload on a pre-existing satellite platform, and the modification of the platform architecture due to a postponement of the satellite launc...|$|R
