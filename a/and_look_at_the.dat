Also in the sessions, {{the opening of the}} restrictor plate was reduced from the 30/32inch plate used in tire testing to 29/32inch. NASCAR vice president for competition Robin Pemberton stated, [...] "We'll have to get back and talk to the teams <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> speeds from the last two days of testing. I think we have some high-water marks at 197-and-a-half [...] which, depending on where they pulled up in the draft, it may be a little quick, but it's hard to say." ...|$|E
500|$|Located at 625 Northwest 21st Avenue in the Nob Hill area of Portland's Northwest District neighborhood, Gypsy was a [...] "boisterous", [...] "disco-balled" [...] dive bar, {{recognizable}} by its bouncers, karaoke, and [...] "wobbling smokers". The Portland Mercury {{said the}} restaurant was a [...] "kinda retro-y bar... popular with a young college-y, drinkin', party crowd". One Portland resident described the club as [...] "the {{kind of place where}} you can go with your sophisticated friends <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Daddy-O decor. Or you can go on a date and snuggle in a corner where the lighting is low. And if you want to meet new people you can stroll through there and see people whose faces you've never seen before, which is a rare thing in Portland." ...|$|E
500|$|On December 17, 2008, Greg Forestell, the province's acting chief coroner, {{called for}} an inquiry into the accident, stating that [...] "he inquest gives us the {{opportunity}} to pull all those facts together in a comprehensive manner <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> issues in their entirety and have the jury make recommendations for prevention." [...] The decision was met with much approval from the victims' families. The inquest began on May 4, 2009 and lasted until May 14. [...] It included testimony from survivors, experts, and provincial officials. The inquest did not blame anyone directly for the accident, but the jury returned 24 recommendations. Kelly Lamrock stated that the province intended to implement the [...] "vast majority" [...] of these recommendations and that a third of them had already been initiated.|$|E

500|$|American Pharoah's {{pedigree}} includes horses {{adept at}} classic race distances on his sire's side and endowed with speed on his dam's side. Sire [...] the Nile won the Santa Anita Derby and ran {{second in the}} 2009 Kentucky Derby, {{with all of his}} wins at distances of [...] miles or more. Prior to American Pharoah, Pioneerof the Nile had sired five other winners of stakes races of a mile or more in his relatively new career as a stallion. Trainer Bob Baffert observed that Pioneerof the Nile also raced with [...] "a big, long stride" [...] and had [...] "that same springing motion as American Pharoah, whose acceleration is pretty remarkable." [...] He also praised Pioneerof the Nile's dam, Star of Goshen: [...] "She was a freaky filly, really, really fast." [...] To Baffert, American Pharoah's bloodline is a source of fascination: [...] "Every time I work him, I go back <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pedigree, and I go, What is going on here?" ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{acknowledging}} {{the possibility that}} humans may be partially responsible for climate change, Johnson rejects government action to control or limit it - including cap and trade - as ineffective. [...] "When {{you look at the}} amount of money we are looking to spend on global warming — in the trillions — <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> result, I just argue that the result is completely inconsequential to the money we would end up spending," [...] he said. [...] "We can direct those moneys to other ways that would be much more beneficial to mankind." [...] Johnson has signed the Western Governors' Association resolution, which aims at [...] "collaborative, incentive driven, locally-based solutions," [...] and has advocated for free market solutions to environmental problems. He has stated that he will not [...] "compromise when it comes to clean air, clean land, or clean water." [...] Johnson supports nuclear energy and fossil fuels, but has stated that the government has a role to protect Americans against businesses that would harm human health or property, including environmental harm.|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{feature for}} [...] "Oathbreaker", showrunner Weiss stated of the Tower of Joy {{flashback}} that [...] "One {{of the best}} things about being able to go back with Bran <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> past {{is to be able to}} see the discrepancy between the received history, the things that everybody knows about the things that happened, and what actually happened." [...] Benioff continued, [...] "Every kid that grows up in Westeros, they all hear about this legendary sword fight that took place twenty years ago, and as far as Bran knew, it was just his father beat this legendary guy." [...] Weiss also stated [...] "Honor was so important to Ned Stark that it was worth losing his own life for, but he was completely ready to let go of that honor and excellence to do something that he really felt was more important. It could make a very, very strong defense for Ned doing what he did, and it certainly does puncture the mythology of Ned Stark that's running through this world, especially after his death." ...|$|E

It's the slow-mo scene where I take off the helmet and swoosh my hair <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> camera ... and it kills me. It's so hilarious, it's ridiculous. [...] It's a really different thing for us to do because it's not performance at all. Everybody was laughing at me the whole time. I was just like, 'Please don't laugh at me. Just give me five minutes so I can do this.'" [...] Lee added that the message of the video is {{in the name of the}} products her character is advertising, each of which are called [...] "Lies" [...] because according to her [...] " [...] whole life is a lie.

He cut three albums of what has been described as [...] "sex funk": Greetings from L.A., Sefronia <b>and</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Fool. Buckley had alienated much of his hippie fan base with his previous two albums, and his often sexually frank lyrics ("whip me, spank me") prevented the songs from receiving airplay; but he retained a cult following.|$|E

God directed Moses to climb the summit of Pisgah <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> land.

2500|$|Instead of {{attempting}} a media blackout {{as with the}} 2008 Tibetan unrest, the Party has adopted a series of more advanced techniques to influence the information leaving China.

It invited foreign media to Xinjiang to tour the riot zones, visit hospitals, <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> aftermath themselves.

And for us, that kind of became like a theme. Brian's got all of this ancient gear - synthesisers from the time that synthesisers were being made - and they were incredibly futuristic at that time. And then as we got more into it ... the whole aesthetic started to evolve from there." ...|$|E

2500|$|Biographer Anne Edwards {{wrote about}} the tone and tenor of Shirley Temple films, [...] "This was mid-Depression, and schemes proliferated {{for the care of}} the needy and the {{regeneration}} of the fallen. But they all required endless paperwork and demeaning, hours-long queues, {{at the end of which}} an exhausted, nettled social worker dealt with each person as a faceless number. Shirley offered a natural solution: to open one's heart." [...] Edwards pointed out that the characters created for the little actress would change the lives of the cold, the hardened, and the criminal with positive results. Her films were seen as generating hope and optimism, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt said, [...] "It is a splendid thing that for just fifteen cents an American can go to a movie <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> smiling face of a baby and forget his troubles." ...|$|E
