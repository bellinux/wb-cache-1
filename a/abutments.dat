5|$|An implant {{supported}} bridge (or fixed denture) is a {{group of}} teeth secured to dental implants so the prosthetic cannot be removed by the user. Bridges typically connect to more than one implant and may also connect to teeth as anchor points. Typically the number of teeth will outnumber the anchor points with the teeth that are directly over the implants referred to as <b>abutments</b> and those between <b>abutments</b> referred to as pontics. Implant supported bridges attach to implant <b>abutments</b> {{in the same way as}} a single tooth implant replacement. A fixed bridge may replace as few as two teeth (also known as a fixed partial denture) and may extend to replace an entire arch of teeth (also known as a fixed full denture). In both cases, the prosthesis is said to be fixed because it cannot be removed by the denture wearer.|$|E
5|$|The {{platform}} {{between the}} implant and the abutment can be flat (buttress) or conical fit. In conical fit <b>abutments,</b> {{the collar of}} the abutment sits inside the implant which allows a stronger junction between implant and abutment and a better seal against bacteria into the implant body. To improve the gingival seal around the abutment collar, a narrowed collar on the abutment is used, referred to as platform switching. The combination of conical fits and platform switching gives marginally better long term periodontal conditions compared to flat-top <b>abutments.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, stock <b>abutments</b> {{are used}} to retain {{dentures}} using a male-adapter attached to the implant and a female adapter in the denture. Two common types of adapters are the ball-and-socket style retainer and the button-style adapter. These types of stock <b>abutments</b> allow movement of the denture, but enough retention {{to improve the quality}} of life for denture wearers, compared to conventional dentures. Regardless of the type of adapter, the female portion of the adapter that is housed in the denture will require periodic replacement, however the number and adapter type does not seem to affect patient satisfaction with the prosthetic for various removable alternatives.|$|E

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{concerning}} {{the area of}} contact between screw thread and <b>abutment,</b> the increase of <b>abutment</b> angulation leads to decrease area of friction that leads to retention and thus screw loosening occurs. Comparing micromotion level between a straight <b>abutment,</b> a 15 ° to 25 ° <b>abutment</b> angulation, {{an increase in the}} micromotion level by 30 % was observed. This micromotion may explain the screw failure. However, no screw failure occurred in a study with 2261 angled <b>abutment</b> evaluated for 96  months [29, 32].|$|R
5|$|Detailed {{planning}} {{started in}} March 1990, {{and at first}} two technical methods for constructing the pontoon bridge were considered: a continuous concrete floating caisson between the <b>abutments,</b> and a steel version incorporating a truss bridge carrying concrete pontoons. However, they were both rejected {{in favor of a}} concrete or steel box section borne on concrete pontoons.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, {{residents}} of nearby settlements urged {{construction of the}} railway line to the proposed bridge site, but they were told this extension of the line was to be delayed. Within that year {{it was decided that}} a bridge was to be constructed due to increased traffic volume, and tenders were let for manufacture of the bridge spans, construction of <b>abutments</b> and piles, and transport of materials to the future construction site.|$|E
5|$|North Parade Bridge {{was built}} almost 100 {{years later in}} 1836 by William Tierney Clark. His {{original}} bridge was made of cast iron on stone <b>abutments,</b> with lodges and staircases. This was rebuilt in 1936 completely in stone. Many of the buildings in South Parade are now hotels and restaurants whilst some remain as private residences. The area which Wood envisaged as an area of sunken gardens matching the houses is now a car park.|$|E
40|$|The {{prosthetic}} {{component of}} dental implant is attached on the <b>abutment</b> which {{is connected to}} the fixture with an <b>abutment</b> screw. The <b>abutment</b> screw fracture is not frequent; however, the retrieval of the fractured screw is not easy, and it poses complications. A retrieval kit was developed which utilizes screw removal drills to make a hole on the fractured screw that provides an engaging drill to unscrew it. To minimize this process, the <b>abutment</b> screw is modified with a prefabricated access hole for easy retrieval. This study aimed to introduce this modified design of the <b>abutment</b> screw, the concept of easy retrieval, and to compare the mechanical strengths of the conventional and hollow <b>abutment</b> screws by finite element analysis (FEA) and mechanical test. In the FEA results, both types of <b>abutment</b> screws showed similar stress distribution in the single artificial tooth system. A maximum load difference of about 2 % occurred in the vertical load by a mechanical test. This study showed that the hollow <b>abutment</b> screw may be an alternative to the conventional <b>abutment</b> screws because this is designed for easy retrieval and that both <b>abutment</b> screws showed {{no significant difference in the}} mechanical tests and in the FEA...|$|R

Consequently, townhouses have built up against both sides of it.|$|E
5|$|The first {{bridge to}} be {{constructed}} was a three-arch stone bridge, {{which was built}} in 1746. It was destroyed by a heavy storm which caused the River Taff to flood about two years later. A large amount of debris came down the river, which then become trapped against the two <b>abutments</b> supporting the bridge. The weight and force of the debris ultimately destroyed the bridge, which was then swept away down the river.|$|E
40|$|Integral <b>Abutment</b> Bridges (IABs) are {{jointless}} structures {{without bearings}} or expansion joints, which require minimum or zero maintenance. The {{barrier to the}} application of longspan IABs is {{the interaction of the}} <b>abutment</b> with the backfill soil during the thermal expansion and contraction of the bridge deck, i. e. serviceability, or when the bridge is subjected to dynamic loads, such as earthquakes. The interaction of the bridge with the backfill leads to settlements and ratcheting of the soil behind the <b>abutment</b> and, as a result, the soil pressures acting on the <b>abutment</b> build-up in the long-term. This paper provides a solution for the aforementioned challenges, by introducing a novel isolator that is a compressible inclusion (CI) of reused tyre derived aggregates (TDA) placed between the bridge <b>abutment</b> and the backfill. The compressibility of typical tyre derived aggregates was measured by laboratory tests and the compressible inclusion was designed accordingly. The CI was then applied to a typical integral frame <b>abutment</b> model, which was subjected to static and dynamic loads representing in-service and seismic loads correspondingly. The response of both the conventional and the isolated <b>abutment</b> was assessed based on the settlements of the backfill, the soil pressures and the actions of the <b>abutment.</b> The study of the isolated <b>abutment</b> showed that the achieved decoupling of the <b>abutment</b> from the backfill soil results in significant reductions of the settlements of the backfill and of the pressures acting on the <b>abutment.</b> Hence, the proposed research can be of use for extending the length limits of integral frame bridges subjected to earthquake excitation...|$|R

5|$|Since its inception, {{hundreds}} of millions of dollars have been poured into the Auburn Dam project, but no further work has been done since the 1980s. However, the Bureau of Reclamation continues to list the Auburn as a considered alternative for the future of its Auburn-Folsom South Unit project. As of now, massive evidence of the dam's construction still remain in the North Fork American River canyon, specifically the excavations for the <b>abutments</b> and spillway, with the consequences of increased erosion.|$|E
40|$|A {{full-scale}} prototype integral bridge <b>abutment</b> was constructed at the University of Massachusetts Amherst {{as part of}} a project conducted for the Massachusetts Highway Department. Ten tests were then conducted during which the <b>abutment</b> was passively displaced into the backfill. The purpose of these tests was to determine the effect of foundation type, wingwall geometry, reloading, and backfill soil type on the lateral pressures generated following placement of the backfill and during the <b>abutment</b> movement. ^ Individual tests were performed by placing and compacting the fill in lifts and then incrementally displacing the <b>abutment</b> into the fill. During this displacement, earth pressures at the <b>abutment</b> centerline, ‘quarterline,’ and wingwall centerline as well as the applied load and deflection of the <b>abutment</b> and wingwalls were measured. After a series of tests were performed with the <b>abutment</b> on a spread footing, the <b>abutment</b> was removed and piles were driven through precast holes in the footing. Two piles were instrumented with strain gages and inclinometers. The <b>abutment</b> was then replaced and the same types of tests were again performed. ^ Results from testing indicated that during no test was the distribution or magnitude of lateral earth pressures similar to that predicted by classical theory. The use of an uncompacted sand zone directly behind the <b>abutment</b> face was found to reduce lateral earth pressures significantly. This zone was, however, found to compact after one cycle of reloading. Both wingwall geometry and foundation type were found to affect the lateral earth pressure magnitude and distribution. ^ Equations were developed which predict the lateral earth pressure coefficient for any <b>abutment</b> deflection or point along the <b>abutment</b> height. Current design charts were also modified to account for the behavior observed during these tests. ...|$|R

MD32's new bridge across the Patapsco River was the longest of only three aluminum triangular box beam girder bridges constructed in the United States. The girder system was topped by a concrete slab deck and underlain with standard concrete <b>abutments</b> and piers and steel bearing pads on which the aluminum girders rested. These bridges, which were designed by Fairchild Engine and Airplane Company, were constructed of aluminum due to that metal's light weight but similar strength compared to steel. Many experimental aluminum bridges were built due to a severe shortage of steel in the early 1960s. Aluminum bridges are rarely constructed because they are much more expensive than steel and concrete bridges.|$|E
5|$|Prior to parkway construction, nine {{roads and}} two rail lines crossed the Arroyo Seco and its valley on bridges, {{and a number}} of new bridges were built as part of the project. Only four of the {{existing}} bridges were kept, albeit with some changes: the 1925 Avenue 26 Bridge, the 1926 Avenue 60 Bridge, the 1895 Santa Fe Arroyo Seco Railroad Bridge (now part of the Gold Line) near Avenue 64, and the 1912 York Boulevard Bridge. The Avenue 43 Bridge would have been kept had the Los Angeles Flood of 1938 not destroyed it. At Cypress Avenue, <b>abutments</b> and a foundation were built for a roadway, but were not used until the 1960s, when a pedestrian bridge was built as part of the Golden State Freeway (I-5) interchange project.

40|$|Introduction. Differences {{between the}} tooth and implant {{response}} to load {{can lead to}} many biological and technical implications in the conditions of occlusal forces. Objective. The objective {{of this study was}} to analyze load distribution in tooth/implant-supported fixed partial dentures with the use of resilient TSA (Titan Shock Absorber, BoneCare GmbH, Augsburg, Germany) <b>abutment</b> and conventional non-resilient <b>abutment</b> using finite element method. Methods. This study presents two basic 3 D models. For one model a standard non-resilient <b>abutment</b> is used, and on the implant of the second model a resilient TSA <b>abutment</b> is applied. The virtual model contains drawn contours of tooth, mucous membranes, implant, cortical bones and spongiosa, <b>abutment</b> and suprastructure. The experiment used 500 N of vertical force, applied in three different cases of axial load. Calculations of von Mises equivalent stresses of the tooth root and periodontium, implants and peri-implant tissue were made. Results. For the model to which a non-resilient <b>abutment</b> is applied, maximum stress values in all three cases are observed in the cortical part of the bone (maximum stress value of 49. 7 MPa). Measurements of stress and deformation in the bone tissue in the model with application of the resilient TSA <b>abutment</b> demonstrated similar distribution; however, these values are many times lower than in the model with non-resilient TSA <b>abutment</b> (maximum stress value of 28. 9 MPa). Conclusion. Application of the resilient TSA <b>abutment</b> results in more equal distribution of stress and deformations in the bone tissue under vertical forces. These values are many times lower than in the model with the non-resilient <b>abutment...</b>|$|R

5|$|Stone bridge {{construction}} {{started with the}} excavation of foundations for the <b>abutments.</b> Then a temporary structure known as a center or centering would be built of wood or iron. This structure supported the stone arch during construction. Once the stone arch was built, the spandrel walls and wing walls could be added. Then the road bed was built, with fill (loose stones or dirt) added to support it as needed. Wall and arch stones were generally set in place dry to ensure a good fit, then set in mortar. Once the bridge was complete and the mortar had properly hardened, the center was gradually lowered and then removed. In March 1996, after standing for between 156 and 121 years, the arch of Bridge No. 3 finally collapsed.|$|E
5|$|After the 1903 {{destruction}} of the original wooden bridge at Belvidere, plans to construct another bridge started immediately. After the storm, the substructure of the crossing had survived the strong storm. The bridge corporation set a completion date, August 17, 1904, which was {{the day that the}} Farmer's Picnic was held in Belvidere. However, the contractor of which they hired to reconstruct the bridge, the New Jersey Bridge Company of Manasquan, New Jersey, believed that the new bridge would need new <b>abutments</b> and piers to be completed by that time, instead of using the old wooden bridge's piers. The three piers from the wooden bridge were used, and would require them to be heightened to be above any high flood waters. On June 3, 1904, the bridge construction began on a barge in the river, with promises to be complete by the set date of August 17. On August 17, the bridge was not complete, but usable, that when the Farmer's Picnic (the predecessor to the Warren County Fair, occurred, people were allowed to cross a majority of the bridge. The picnic itself was a complete success, attracting over 15,000 people, most of which walked the bridge.|$|E
5|$|First, Frederick {{had assumed}} {{he could use}} his trade-mark oblique order attack, but his {{reconnaissance}} had been incomplete. The Russians {{had been there for}} two weeks, had dug in to prepare for Frederick's arrival, and their fortifications bristled with abatis and guns. When he did arrive, Frederick had made limited efforts to assess the terrain and there was no operational reason for him not to have sent some of his cavalry to scout the area, except, perhaps, that his hussars, previously often used in reconnaissance, were being converted by Seydlitz into heavy cavalry. In the two weeks they had to prepare for the battle, the Russians and the Austrians had discovered, and reinforced, a causeway between the lakes and the marshland that allowed them to present Frederick with a united southeastern front. This effectively cancelled any advantage of the oblique battle order employed so successfully at Rossbach and Leuthen. Furthermore, the Russians utilized several natural defensive positions. The chain of hillocks could be enhanced by the construction of redans; the Russians were able to shape <b>abutments</b> from which to fire down upon the Prussians; they also constructed bastions, especially on the Spitzberge. Despite the murderous fire, Frederick's troops eventually turned the Russian left, but to little benefit. The terrain allowed the Russians and Austrians to form a compact front up to 100 men deep, shielded by the hills and marshes.|$|E
30|$|Cho et al. [39] {{studied the}} effect of {{retightening}} the <b>abutment</b> screw on RTVs in internal connection implants under cyclic loading at 3, 10, 100, and every 20, 000 [*]cycles up to 100, 000 [*]cycles. They found {{that most of the}} decrease in RTVs occurred at 10 [*]cycles, and after that, RTVs did not change significantly. The study showed that retightening the <b>abutment</b> screw under cyclic loading resulted in superior RTVs when compared with no retightening [39]. However, retightening the <b>abutment</b> screw might change the shape of the <b>abutment</b> screw and the inner screw thread of the implant [41]. In our study, we demonstrated decreasing the RTVs after cyclic loading without retightening the <b>abutment</b> screw.|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} study, removal toque of <b>abutment</b> screw after the cyclic loading showed no {{statistically}} significant difference among the groups. Generally, conical <b>abutment</b> is believed to be better in fit and stability than non-conical connection [11]. One possibility of this discrepancy {{may be due to the}} deformation of <b>abutment</b> screw. Actually, implant–abutment connection after the removal of <b>abutment</b> screw was still tight in CC group, but they were easily divided in other two groups. This may indicate that implant–abutment connection in CC group was almost sound and intact after the loading. In contrast, in EP and IP groups, <b>abutment</b> screw may be deformed which lead to the increase of RTV of <b>abutment</b> screw. The fracture of <b>abutment</b> screws in EP and IP groups may support this speculation. In addition, axial force is strongly affected by the interfacial friction coefficient [12]. In the present study, interfacial friction was supposed to be largest in CC group because the contact area between implant body and <b>abutment</b> was smallest in EP group and both EP and IP groups had parallel walls at the interface with gaps and voids [13, 14]. This may be one reason for the larger standard deviation of RTV in both EP and IP groups.|$|R
