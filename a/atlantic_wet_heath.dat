40|$|The EU {{member states}} are {{required}} to designate Natura 2000 protected sites {{and to ensure that}} these form an ecologically coherent network. However, no assessment of coherence in the terrestrial environment has yet assessed all the core attributes important for ecological coherence (representivity, replication, patch sizes and shapes, and connectivity). In this study, a method is presented that addresses all of the above criteria for three main Annex I habitats in Scotland (Caledonian woodland, Tilio-acerion forest of slopes, screes and ravines, and Northern <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Wet</b> <b>heath</b> with Erica tetralix). The spatial distributions of these habitats were modelled based on knowledge rules identified from the British National Vegetation Community (NVC) descriptions. Only knowledge rules that were shown to significantly improve the detection of individual habitats were applied. Representivity and replication were subsequently assessed by determining the area and number of habitats within the Natura 2000 sites. Size and shape of the habitat patches were analysed with statistical measurements. The connectivity was modelled with least-cost networks. Two sources of costs were used and they were assigned to four different land-cover maps. Results of these analyses were reported for the whole of Scotland and for Scotland Rural Development Programme’s Regional Project Assessment Committees regions. 202, 648 ha of Caledonian pinewood, 252, 216 ha with ravine woodland and 1, 551, 805 ha of wet heath were detected.

40|$|Post-print del artículo publicado en Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society. Versión revisada y corregidaCheirolophus uliginosus {{is a rare}} species, {{endemic to}} the {{south-western}} Iberian Peninsula, and listed as a characteristic taxon from the temperate <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wet</b> <b>heaths,</b> a priority habitat for conservation by the European Union. The conservation status of this species in most of its distribution area is poorly known, but, in recent times, some populations have disappeared {{and there has been}} a reduction in the number of individuals in others. In this context, we analysed the effects of population size on genetic diversity, revealing that genetic erosion and inbreeding depression could be having a significant impact on smaller populations. Furthermore, we studied the patterns of genetic structure and variability at the species level, finding a strikingly low within-population diversity and high among-population genetic differentiation. Finally, the genetic structure analyses suggested a long and complex phylogeographical history of C. uliginosus in the region, in agreement with the climate relict status proposed for this species.

40|$|Questions How are species {{turnover}} {{and community}} change assessed by a plot-specific approach based on quasi-permanent plots? How can community changes be tracked by a community-specific approach based on community surveys? Do {{the results of}} a community-specific approach depend on the grain of the community classification?Locations <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wet</b> <b>heaths,</b> southwest France. Methods We studied vegetation change at one site (Cousseau National Nature Reserve, NNR) and within a network of sites on a regional scale using two resurvey approaches: a plot-specific and a community-specific approach based on sets of old (1968 – 1998) and new (2006 – 2012) plots. Two correspondence analyses (CAs) were performed and plots were classified into community types (CTs) using hierarchical clustering. Trajectories of quasi-permanent plots were described along identified gradients. Community change within each CT was detected by testing for differences in mean coordinates along CA axes between old and new plots. Several grains of clustering were tested for the community-specific approach at the regional scale. Results At the Cousseau NNR site, the plot-specific approach identified the trajectory of each plot along two major ecological gradients, while the community-specific approach detected a community change for only one out of the three defined CTs. For the regional network of sites, the community-specific approach found several community changes; their strength and direction differed slightly when the CTs were defined more accurately. Conclusions Our study suggests that the resurvey strategy influences our ability to detect the degree and characteristics of vegetation changes in time. The plot-specific approach allows detection of species turnover and real trajectories but may over-emphasize community changes. The community-specific approach offers another way to interpret community changes that could be relevant for habitat conservation issues, especially at a regional level. For the community-specific approach, the detection and interpretation of vegetation change is influenced by the grain of community classification...|$|R
