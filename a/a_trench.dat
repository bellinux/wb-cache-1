5|$|During {{the night}} of 20/21 September, the 16th and the 19th Divisions marched {{to the west of}} Nablus, under Liman von Sanders orders, where they linked up with von Oppen's Asia Corps. The next morning, von Oppen reorganised the Asia Corps by amalgamating the {{remnants}} of the 702nd and 703rd Battalions into one, with a rifle company, a machine gun company and <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> mortar detachment, while the 701st Battalion with its machine gun company, six guns, a troop of cavalry, an infantry-artillery platoon with two mountain guns or howitzers and <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> mortar section with four mortars and a cavalry squadron, remained intact.|$|E
5|$|During the night, the Asia Corps {{lost touch}} with the 16th and 19th Divisions, but {{following}} the direct orders of Liman von Sanders, these divisions withdrew {{to the west of}} Nablus. Here von Oppen got in contact with them during the morning of 21 September. At that time the remains of the 702nd and 703rd Battalions were reformed into one battalion, supported by a rifle company, a machine gun company and <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> mortar detachment. The 701st Battalion with its machine gun company of six guns, a troop of cavalry, an infantry-artillery platoon with two mountain guns or howitzers and <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> mortar section with four mortars and a cavalry squadron, remained intact.|$|E
5|$|As {{they had}} in the battles of Badr and Uhud, the Muslim army again used {{strategic}} methods against their opponents (at Badr, the Muslims surrounded the wells, but did not deprive their opponents of water since Ali did not want to follow the footsteps of the Meccan army; at the Battle of Uhud, Muslims made strategic use of the hills). In this battle they dug <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> to render the enemy cavalry ineffective.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> {{percolation}} <b>trench,</b> {{also called}} <b>an</b> infiltration <b>trench,</b> is <b>a</b> type of best management practice (BMP) {{that is used}} to manage stormwater runoff, prevent flooding and downstream erosion, and improve water quality in an adjacent river, stream, lake or bay. It is <b>a</b> shallow excavated <b>trench</b> filled with gravel or crushed stone that is designed to infiltrate stormwater though permeable soils into the groundwater aquifer.|$|R
5|$|In {{front of}} the Royal Crescent is a Ha-ha, <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> on which the inner side of which is {{vertical}} and faced with stone, with the outer face sloped and turfed, making the trench, in effect, a sunken fence or retaining wall. The ha-ha is designed not to interrupt the view from Royal Victoria Park, and to be invisible until seen from close by.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{returns to}} England briefly, and finds relief at {{being able to}} enjoy the Norfolk {{countryside}} away from the trenches. When he meets Jeanne again on the way back, he tells her how he dreads returning to the front line after leave. Weir, Stephen's closest friend, is eventually killed by a sniper's bullet while in <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> out on the front line.|$|E
5|$|This {{area of the}} Andes {{was subject}} to {{glaciation}} in the past, which has left traces especially in adjacent valleys. These valleys are U-shaped or have the form of <b>a</b> <b>trench,</b> shapes associated with glacial action. The older volcanics of Laguna del Maule have been disproportionately eroded by glacial action. Slopes around Laguna del Maule are covered by colluvium including talus slopes.|$|E
50|$|In 1976, {{the family}} moved to Alamosa, Colorado where Crowder bought a small farm and started <b>a</b> <b>trenching</b> and {{excavating}} company. The business contracted with the phone company to bury telephone lines in Southern Colorado. The advent of fiber optic technology in the late 1990s made the excavating company's services obsolete.|$|R

5000|$|Aeroplane photos {{showed that}} the Rushdi and Kauwukah {{trenches}} were deep, well sited, and even more elaborate than was the case at Beersheba. They consisted of <b>a</b> fire <b>trench,</b> <b>a</b> control <b>trench</b> roughly parallel to it, and numerous communication trenches. Machine-gun positions seemed to be everywhere, and the flank was covered by series of detached positions on the hilltops to the east, finishing away in the very difficult terrain in the neighbourhood of the Beersheba-Hebron road.

5|$|Antigonus, who {{had brought}} with him a large force of 20,000 {{infantry}} and 1,300 cavalry, was marching through Euboea towards the Peloponnese. The hostile Aetolian League occupying parts of Thessaly had threatened to oppose him if he went further south than Thermopylae, despite their neutrality {{at that point in}} the war. Aratus met Antigonus at Pagae, where he was pressured by Antigonus into giving Megara to Boeotia. When Cleomenes heard of the Macedonian advance through Euboea, he abandoned his siege of Sicyon and constructed <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> and palisade running from Acrocorinth to the Isthmus. He chose this location to avoid facing the Macedonian phalanx head-on.|$|E
5|$|Blackadder Goes Forth is {{the fourth}} and final series of the BBC sitcom Blackadder, written by Richard Curtis and Ben Elton, which aired from 28 September to 2 November 1989 on BBC One. The series placed the {{recurring}} characters of Blackadder, Baldrick and George in <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> in Flanders during World War I, and followed their various doomed attempts {{to escape from the}} trenches to avoid certain death under the misguided command of General Melchett. The series is particularly noted for its criticism of the British Army leadership during the campaign, and also refers to a number of famous figures of the age. In addition, the series is remembered for the poignant ending of the final episode.|$|E
5|$|Dingle, who {{had been}} a member of the Oxford Officers Training Corps, was gazetted second {{lieutenant}} in the 6th Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment, which took part in the Suvla Bay Landing of the Gallipoli Campaign on 6 August 1915. His battalion took Scimitar Hill on 9 August, with great loss of life, only to be forced to make a tactical withdrawal. On 21 August, the Battle of Scimitar Hill ensued, a disaster for Britain and her allies: Dingle was killed the following day, defending <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> that had earlier been captured. He is commemorated on the Helles Memorial to the missing dead.|$|E

5|$|In the subplot, Bart cuts {{school on}} the day {{students}} were choosing their physical education classes. By the time he shows up, the only option left is ballet. Despite being reluctant at first, he soon discovers {{that he has a}} talent for the dance form, and is invited to star in a school ballet performance. After his performance, school bullies attempt to beat him up, and he runs away. Bart attempts to escape by jumping <b>a</b> <b>trench,</b> but fails to make it and takes a nasty fall. The bullies leave, while Lisa tells Bart how proud she is of him, that they are now kindred spirits.|$|E
5|$|Lance Corporal Jose Francisco Jimenez (1946â€“1969) was {{assigned}} to Company K, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division. On August 28, 1969, his unit came under heavy attack by North Vietnamese Army soldiers concealed in well-camouflaged emplacements at Quang Nam Province. Jimenez personally destroyed several enemy personnel and silenced an antiaircraft weapon. He then maneuvered to within ten feet of hostile soldiers who were firing automatic weapons from <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> and, {{in the face of}} vicious enemy fire, destroyed the position. As he moved to attack another enemy soldier, he was mortally wounded.|$|E
5|$|The {{depiction}} of Diplodocus posture has changed considerably over the years. For instance, a classic 1910 reconstruction by Oliver P. Hay depicts two Diplodocus with splayed lizard-like limbs {{on the banks}} of a river. Hay argued that Diplodocus had a sprawling, lizard-like gait with widely splayed legs, and was supported by Gustav Tornier. This hypothesis was contested by William Jacob Holland, who demonstrated that a sprawling Diplodocus would have needed <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> through which to pull its belly. Finds of sauropod footprints in the 1930s eventually put Hay's theory to rest.|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{investigation}} {{of the effectiveness of}} <b>a</b> step-shaped <b>trench</b> in reducing train-induced vibrations Jabbar-Ali Zakeri, Morteza Esmaeili and Seyed-Ali Mosayebi In this paper, <b>a</b> step-shaped <b>trench</b> was introduced for the attenuation of train-induced vibration levels on trackside buildings. In order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the proposed type of trench in comparison with <b>a</b> standard rectangular <b>trench,</b> <b>a</b> two-dimensional finite element model was developed under plane strain conditions using the ABAQUS soft-ware. The validity of the preliminary model of the track including <b>a</b> rectangular-shaped <b>trench</b> was confirmed by a close agreement of obtained results with those of previous studies. The effectiveness of the step-shaped trench compared with the rectangular type was studied in open and in-filled forms in terms of decreasing the effects of ground-borne vibrations on trackside structures. The obtained results for open and in-filled step-shaped trenches respectively showed 21 % and 26. 2 % decreases in the maximum amplitude reduction ratio with respect to the common rectangular trench. Moreover, in the case of a real train moving loads, the proposed trench shape further decreased the values of peak particle velocity, root mean square and particle velocity decibel on a trackside structure compared with the values obtained for <b>a</b> rectangular-shaped <b>trench...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{experience}} of the Battle of the Somme led the German command {{to conclude that the}} policy of rigidly defending <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> position line was no longer effective against the firepower that the Entente armies had accumulated. Ludendorff published a new defensive doctrine in December 1916, in which deeper defences were to be built, within which the garrison would have room to manoeuvre, rather than rigidly holding successive lines of trenches. Along Vimy Ridge, the German forces spent two years constructing fortifications designed for rigid defence. Little reconstruction based upon the new defence-in-depth doctrine had been accomplished by April 1917 because the terrain made it impractical.|$|E
5|$|The largely outnumbered {{defenders}} of Medina, mainly Muslims led by Islamic prophet Muhammad, dug <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> on {{the suggestion of}} Salman Farsi, which together with Medina's natural fortifications, rendered the confederate cavalry (consisting of horses and camels) useless, locking the two sides in a stalemate. Hoping to make several attacks at once, the confederates persuaded the Muslim-allied Medinan Jews, Banu Qurayza, to attack the city from the south. However, Muhammad's diplomacy derailed the negotiations, and broke up the confederacy against him. The well-organised defenders, the sinking of confederate morale, and poor weather conditions caused the siege to end in a fiasco.|$|E
5|$|The road forks to the {{northeast}} between large buildings and passes beneath Bloor Street, then crosses the Rosedale Ravine. It passes through residential South Rosedale, entering <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> and passing beneath Crescent Road. The road descends into the Yellow Creek ravine (crossing David A. Balfour Park) along the former route of Roxborough Drive, then climbs to pass beneath the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks. It continues to climb along the eastern bank of the ravine, entering Moore Park and turning north at St. Clair Avenue East. The road passes through the centre of Mount Pleasant Cemetery, after which it takes its name. It crosses the old Belt Line Railway trail, and winds northeast into Davisville Village.|$|E

The {{construction of the}} new section of the DR was planned {{in conjunction with the}} building of the Victoria Embankment and was achieved by the cut and cover method of roofing over <b>a</b> <b>trench.</b> Due to its proximity to the South Eastern Railway's Charing Cross station, the station was originally called Charing Cross.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} of Ombifotsy was ruled by Andriambahoakafovoanitany, {{who had a}} friendly relationship with Andriamasinavalona. The two agreed to a challenge: each would leave his palace simultaneously on a chosen Friday night, and walk toward the other's palace until the two met. They crossed paths at the Ombifotsy ("White Zebu") river, so named because the two sacrificed a white zebu there in honor of their friendship and the peace agreement between their two territories of Imamo and Imerina. Andriambahoakafovoanitany's son dug <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> along the river, where he erected a stone to commemorate the agreement. Imamo was divided into four parts, each administered by one of Andriambahoakafovoanitany's sons.|$|E
5|$|A {{soldier who}} participated in the battle {{reported}} that only 20 uninjured troops were left to defend the police station as the second Syrian column reached Samakh (Tzemah). The only heavy weapon the defenders possessed was ineffective against Syrian armor. Fearing their forces would be completely cut off, an order was given by the Haganah to retreat and leave the wounded, Tzvika Levkov among them. The retreat was disorganized and heavy Israeli casualties were recorded as Samakh's police station fell. Reinforcements from the Deganias, commanded by Moshe Cohen, arrived but were immediately hit by the Syrians and did not significantly affect the battle. Aharon Israeli, a platoon commander in these reinforcements, wrote that it was clear as soon as they arrived that the battle was over. Cohen would not hear of a retreat initially, but when the force saw Levkov fall into <b>a</b> <b>trench,</b> they hastily withdrew.|$|E
