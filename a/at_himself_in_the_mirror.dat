25|$|The game also {{includes}} an alternate final level, where the final battle is played from Leo's perspective. He successfully destroys Daniel's personality and {{wakes up in}} control of his mind and body. Whyte, who thinks she is speaking to Daniel, asks him if he is okay, to which he replies he is keen {{to get back to}} work on the Bridge. As he looks <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> Daniel sees Leo's reflection looking back at him.|$|E
25|$|Following Duffey's murder, Nilsen {{began to}} kill with {{increasing}} frequency. Before {{the end of}} 1980, he was to kill a further five victims and attempt to murder one other, although {{only one of these}} victims whom Nilsen murdered, 26-year-old William David Sutherland, has ever been identified. Nilsen's recollections of the unidentified victims are vague, although he graphically recalled how each victim had been murdered and just how long the body had been retained before dissection. One unidentified victim killed in November had moved his legs in a cycling motion as he was strangled (Nilsen is known to have absented himself from work between 11 and 18 November, likely due to this particular murder); another unidentified victim Nilsen had unsuccessfully attempted to resuscitate, before sinking to his knees and sobbing, before standing to expressly spit at his own image as he looked <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> On another occasion, he had lain in bed alongside the body of an unidentified victim as he listened to the classical theme Fanfare for the Common Man before bursting into tears.|$|E
500|$|At the Palmer home, Leland smiles <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> BOB {{stares back}} {{at him from the}} {{reflection}} and cackles madly. Leland dons a pair of latex gloves. Maddy comes downstairs complaining of a burning smell and sees Sarah unconscious on the floor. She sees Leland grinning at her, then sees BOB appear in Leland's place. She screams in terror and attempts to flee. Leland chases Maddy up the stairs, and drags her to the living room. He strangles and punches her, then taunts and chases her around the living room. He corners her and punches her in the face until she is catatonic. He dances with and cries over her limp body, calling her [...] "Laura," [...] while Bob kisses her. Leland / BOB then becomes enraged and screams, [...] "Leland says you're going back to Missoula, MONTANA!" [...] as he rams her head into a glass picture frame, the words [...] "Missoula, Montana" [...] in the lower corner of the picture. Maddy collapses, bloodied and dead. A crazed Leland places a cutout of the letter [...] "O" [...] under the nail of Maddy's left ring finger.|$|E
60|$|Sam squinted <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{glass and}} added a touch of black to his nose.|$|R
60|$|March {{was in fact}} {{somewhat}} astonished <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{light of}} her reasoning; but she went on with some sophistries that restored him to his self-righteousness.|$|R
6000|$|LORD GORING. [Looking <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass.] Don’t think I {{quite like}} this buttonhole, Phipps. Makes me look a little too old. Makes me almost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> prime of life, eh, Phipps? ...|$|R
60|$|Hurriedly {{pulling off}} his coat, he looked <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b>|$|E
60|$|Joe turned away, looking <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> as he unbuttoned his tunic.|$|E
60|$|She goes out. Augustus {{returns to}} the writing-table smiling, and takes another look <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> The clerk returns, with his head bandaged, {{carrying}} a poker.|$|E
60|$|He {{tried it}} on. There {{was a little}} peal of {{laughter}} from the men. Philippa had ceased her knitting and was watching from the couch. Sir Henry looked <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> looking-glass.|$|R
60|$|Lessingham looked <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{glass and}} removed the hat from his head with, some casual observation. He was entirely at his ease. His host turned towards the door, which Mills was holding open.|$|R
6000|$|... "The only trouble is, Jim," [...] he said, peering <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass, [...] "shan't I {{scare the}} boy to death {{directly}} he sees me? Oughtn't I {{to give him some}} sort of warning?" ...|$|R
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> {{surprised}} that {{his face had}} not been branded by the hells {{of the past three}} months. The noise of the decks worried him, and he lay down, his tongue only a little pressed against his palate.|$|E
6000|$|Nor did he pause {{until he}} had emerged from the forest and crossed the plains, and reached at last the city from whence he had escaped in the balloon. And, once again in his old lodgings, he looked <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> and said: ...|$|E
60|$|Sam turned. He {{had been}} looking <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> with a {{satisfaction}} which, to the casual observer, his appearance would not have seemed to justify. Hignett had not been suffering from a delusion. His cousin's face was black; and, even as he turned, he gave it a dab {{with a piece of}} burnt cork and made it blacker.|$|E
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass. He wore {{no longer}} the well-cut clothes of Mr. Douglas Romilly's Saville Row tailor, but a {{ready-made}} suit of Schmitt & Mayer's business reach-me-downs, an American felt hat and square-toed shoes.|$|R
6000|$|He {{took the}} Browning and the Swinburne {{from the chair}} and kissed them. Just the same, {{she told me to}} call again, he thought. He took another look <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass, and said aloud, with great solemnity:- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Steve, I {{want you}} to tell me something," [...] said Rose to Dandy, who was making faces <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass, while he waited for an answer to the note he brought from his mother to Aunt Plenty.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{he became}} aware that Janet Spence was in the room, {{standing}} near the door. Mr. Hutton started, {{as though he had}} been taken in some felonious act. To make these silent and spectral appearances was one of Janet Spence's peculiar talents. Perhaps she had been there all the time, had seen him looking <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> Impossible! But, still, it was disquieting.|$|E
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} a clothier arrived with several suits of handsome material and make, out of sober colours, {{such as a}} young man of good family would wear, and an armourer brought him a morion and breast and back pieces of steel, handsomely inlaid with gold. When he was alone he attired himself in the quietest of his new suits, and looking <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> burst into a fit of hearty laughter.|$|E
6000|$|... "But when {{he began}} to talk to her," [...] {{continued}} John Gayther, [...] "his former feelings for her returned. She was charming, and he forgot about her hair. Her conversation greatly interested him; and now that his conscience came to the assistance of his affection (for he was doing exactly what Dr. Paltravi desired him to do), he was quite happy and spent a pleasant evening. But in the morning, as he looked <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> he remembered her gray hair." ...|$|E
60|$|During the {{progress}} of the foregoing remarks, which Mrs Gamp had addressed exclusively to the barber, Mr Bailey had been tying his cravat, getting on his coat, and making hideous faces <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass. Being now personally addressed by Mrs Gamp, he turned round, and mingled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conversation.|$|R
60|$|One terrible morning Ralph {{spent in}} a hairdresser's hands and, {{at the cost of}} no little pain, got rid of all that mass of hair which had so {{transformed}} him. The stain was now nearly worn off the skin; and Ralph was quite surprised, when he again looked <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite so, Sergeant," [...] said Higgs, {{as he took}} them; [...] "it's sacrilege {{to think}} of using water to wash. I intend never to waste it in that way again." [...] Then he looked <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass, and let it fall upon the sand, ejaculating, [...] "Oh! good Lord, is that me?" ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} of a pause after the door had closed. A certain constraint. I mixed myself a beaker, while Gussie, a glutton for punishment, stared <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> Finally I decided that {{it would be best to}} let him know that I was abreast of his affairs. It might be that it would ease his mind to confide in a sympathetic man of experience. I have generally found, with those under the influence, that what they want more than anything is the listening ear.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am quite}} charmed,' said the father rising, and walking slowly to and fro--stopping {{now and then}} to glance <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> or survey a picture through his glass, with the air of a connoisseur, 'that we have had this conversation, Ned, unpromising as it was. It {{establishes}} a confidence between us which is quite delightful, and was certainly necessary, though how you can ever have mistaken our positions and designs, I confess I cannot understand. I conceived, until I found your fancy for this girl, that all these points were tacitly agreed upon between us.' ...|$|E
60|$|Conroy's first discovery, {{made without}} fumbling or {{counting}} letters on taps, {{was that the}} London and South Western's allowance of washing-water is inadequate. He used every drop, rioting in the cold tingle on neck and arms. To shave in a moving train balked him, but the next halt gave him a chance, which, to his own surprise, he took. As he stared <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> he smiled and nodded. There were points about this person with the clear, if sunken, eye and the almost uncompressed mouth. But when he bore his bag back to his compartment, the weight of it on a limp arm humbled that new pride.|$|E
60|$|He {{shook his}} fist <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass, {{and sat down}} on the edge of the bed to dream for a space with wide eyes. Then he got out note-book and algebra and lost <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> {{quadratic}} equations, while the hours slipped by, and the stars dimmed, and the gray of dawn flooded against his window.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then,' rejoined Mr Mould, {{putting up}} his watch, and glancing <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> little shaving-glass, {{that he might}} be sure his face had the right {{expression}} on it; 'then I think we may proceed to business. Give me the paper of gloves, Tacker. Ah, what a man he was! Ah, Tacker, Tacker, what a man he was!' ...|$|R
60|$|LORD GORING. I can’t {{tell you}} how at present. I have not the {{smallest}} idea. But every one has some weak point. There is some flaw in each one of us. [Strolls to the fireplace and looks <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass.] My father tells me that even I have faults. Perhaps I have. I don’t know.|$|R
6000|$|Our hero having now fairly {{assumed the}} 'garb of old Gaul,' well {{calculated}} {{as it was}} to give an appearance of strength to a figure which, though tall and well-made, was rather elegant than robust, I hope my fair readers will excuse him if he looked <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> more than once, and could not help acknowledging that the reflection seemed that of a very handsome young fellow. In fact, there was no disguising it. His light-brown hair--for he wore no periwig, notwithstanding the universal fashion of the time--became the bonnet which surmounted it. His person promised firmness and agility, to which the ample folds of the tartan added an air of dignity. His blue eye seemed of that kind, ...|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} paid, too, got up, and crossed over, {{apparently}} {{for the purpose}} of looking <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> set in the pillar nearest to the Count's seat. He was dressed all in black with a dark green bow tie. The Count looked round, and was startled by meeting a vicious glance out of the corners of the other's eyes. The young Cavaliere from Bari (according to Pasquale; but Pasquale is, of course, an accomplished liar) went on arranging his tie, settling his hat before the glass, and meantime he spoke just loud enough to be heard by the Count. He spoke through his teeth with the most insulting venom of contempt and gazing straight into the mirror.|$|E
60|$|There was {{no doubt}} about it. A curious {{happiness}} pervaded his entire being. He felt young and active. Everything was emphatically for the best in this {{best of all possible}} worlds. The sun was shining. Even the sound of someone in the street below whistling one of his old compositions, of which he had heartily sickened twelve months before, was pleasant to his ears, and this {{in spite of the fact}} that the unseen whistler only touched the key in odd spots and had a poor memory for tunes. George sprang lightly out of bed, and turned on the cold tap in the bath-room. While he lathered his face for its morning shave he beamed <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b>|$|E
60|$|Psmith turned away, {{and resting}} {{his elbows on}} the mantelpiece, gazed <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> mournfully <b>in</b> <b>the</b> looking-glass.|$|R
6000|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass, finding there a very good-looking, stalwart youth, {{but could}} not {{discover}} anything {{to account for the}} sudden blaze of Leonora's self-sacrificing passion. He was neither a fool nor a peacock, and he tried to account for her love on the ground of her regard for his mother. Then, like a flash of light, came the thought, [...] "She was sleep-walking!" ...|$|R
