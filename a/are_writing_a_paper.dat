40|$|The {{second page}} of your paper {{contains}} your abstract. An abstract is a brief, comprehensive {{summary of the}} contents of your paper. It should be accurate, self-contained, concise and specific, nonevaluative, coherent, and readable. It should reflect the purpose and content of your paper. It should not contain more than 960 characters and spaces (around 120 words). When writing abstracts for reviews or theoretical articles, limit them to 75 - 100 words. The American Psychological Association (APA) recommends the following information for this type of paper: the topic in one sentence; the purpose, thesis, or organizing construct and the scope (comprehensive or selective) of the article; the sources used (e. g., personal observation, published literature); and the conclusions. Guidelines for 3 Guidelines for Writing in APA Style APA style is the style of writing specified in the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (4 th ed., 1994).

40|$|Anyone {{interested}} in artificial intelligence knows {{how difficult it}} can be to find comprehensive material on the subject. Textbooks usually cannot cover all interdisciplinary aspects, and review papers are typically specialized in a particular area within the field. This poses a problem for students, but can also be a serious difficulty for the advanced researcher. Few people would claim to have competency in all aspects of artificial intelligence research. The field knows no disciplinary boundaries and the arguments span decades. Articles can be hard to locate and scattered across publications relevant to several different disciplines. Bibliographies can easily miss older or more obscure articles that may be of interest. Comprehensive and interdisciplinary resources that can act as starting points for learning or teaching artificial intelligence are increasingly needed as the field rapidly gains importance, depth and breadth. Consider a few examples: You may have spent years working in artificial intelligence, but still need direction to find information on a question outside your area of focus. Or you may be a student who heard about Searle’s Chinese Room (1980) in class and are {{interested in}} finding out what sort of responses this argument received.
