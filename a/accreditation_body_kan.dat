5000|$|Although {{not a legal}} requirement, {{accreditation}} {{is often}} stipulated and supported by local governments. In order to ensure equally high standards of certification across Europe, the European Commission for Enterprise and Industry set out a European-wide policy for accreditation. This ensures consistency in the accreditation market and is {{designed to protect the}} consumer. Accordingly, it is mandatory for every European member-state to have a single national <b>Accreditation</b> <b>Body</b> (NAB). In the UK, the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) is the formally appointed National <b>Accreditation</b> <b>Body,</b> following the adoption the European regulation. The new Regulation (EC Regulation 765/2008), which came into force on 1 January 2010, requires each member state to appoint a single national <b>accreditation</b> <b>body.</b> UKAS has therefore been appointed by statutory instrument providing, for the first time, a legal basis for its role. The accreditation Regulations 2009 (Statutory Instrument No 3155/2009) making the appointment were signed on 30 November 2009 by Lord Drayson, Minister for Science and Innovation, and announced in a Written Statement to Parliament. In the statement, Lord Drayson said: “The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) has a long standing and effective relationship with UKAS that both parties value highly. We will continue to work together not only to ensure that the requirements of the EC Regulation are fulfilled but to improve the quality and breadth of accreditation in the UK.” Outside of Europe, there is not a set regulation. For example, in the USA there are multiple <b>Accreditation</b> <b>Bodies,</b> whereas within Australasia there is the Joint Accreditation System of Australia and New Zealand. For those countries without a designated National <b>Accreditation</b> <b>Body,</b> the International <b>Accreditation</b> Forum lists member <b>Accreditation</b> <b>Bodies</b> International <b>Accreditation</b> Forum Members and Recognition Categories [...] that only accredit competent bodies, providing buyer confidence.|$|R

40|$|In addition, {{an outline}} of the process as {{required}} by IAF/ILAC A 2 is provided for single <b>accreditation</b> <b>bodies</b> applying to sign the IAF MLA or ILAC MRA directly, because either a Regional Cooperation Group {{does not exist in}} that region, or the Regional Cooperation Group is not recognised via the IAF/ILAC Arrangement for the required scopes. The process described is similar to that used by the recognised Regional Cooperation Groups, that is APLAC, EA, IAAC and PAC for the evaluation of an <b>accreditation</b> <b>body</b> as required by IAF/ILAC A 1. Appendix 1 provides a flow chart describing the overall process. The objective of this guideline is to highlight the steps in the application and evaluation process to enable <b>accreditation</b> <b>bodies</b> to sign the IAF and/or ILAC Arrangements. The intention is to help new <b>accreditation</b> <b>bodies</b> in IAF and ILAC and also newcomers in Regional Cooperation Groups to better understand the evaluation process. If the <b>accreditation</b> <b>body</b> is eligible {{to be a member of}} a Regional Cooperation Group which is recognized via the IAF/ILAC Arrangement, then the <b>accreditation</b> <b>body</b> is strongly encouraged to apply and go through the evaluation process via this Regional Cooperation Group. On gaining member status to the recognised Regional MLA or MRA, and providing the <b>accreditation</b> <b>body</b> is a member of IAF and/or an Associate member of ILAC, it is then able to apply to become a member to the IAF MLA and/or ILAC MRA for the same scope they have gained member status to the Regional MLA/MRA. This member status to the IAF or ILAC Arrangement can then be achieved by the completion of paperwork only, ie. no additional IAF/ILAC evaluations are required. Overview of the organizations of IAF and ILAC The overall organizational structures of IAF and ILAC are available from the websites, www. iaf. nu and www. ilac. org. The committees involved in the management of the Arrangements in IAF and ILAC are: n IAF MLA Committee/ILAC Arrangement Committee: In these committees the evaluation rules, policies and procedures and questions relating to the Arrangements are discussed.
