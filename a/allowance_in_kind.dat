50|$|From its {{inception}} the establishment made every endeavour after self-sufficiency {{by setting up}} its own farm. Supporting funds were sufficient {{from the very beginning}} {{for a wide variety of}} things, so much so that whatever new building was needed it could be built from the surplus. In the course of time, however, due to continually rising prices and cost of wages coupled with stagnation of supporting funds, not only was the work unable to be finished but now the yearly support funds do not even cover the minimum annual wage of the children's carers alone. In reality, the majority of the workers are on a partly voluntary basis. Compensation for the below-average wages is by <b>allowances</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> and other concessions e.g. holiday leave. Electricity and gas is purchased at industrial prices, and for that reason it has not been possible so far to implement gas heating - it is too expensive. The Ukrainian state has provided no material assistance, apart from an up-to-date computer in February 2007 from the district council. As one of the models for the country, the children's home is visited every year by government ministers, various regional medical officers and some church bishops too.|$|R
30|$|In Germany, most {{changes have}} {{applied to the}} Act on the Acceleration of Asylum Procedures, {{but also to the}} Asylum Act and the Act on Changes in the Construction Planning and Zoning Law. The Act on the Acceleration of Asylum Procedures has (re-)introduced the benefit-in-kind principle. Refugees in {{reception}} sites only receive <b>allowances</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> instead of cash benefits (AsylVerfG, Article 2 (3)). The period of the stay in a reception center has been extended from 3 to 6  months (AsylVerfG, Article 15 a and AsylG § 47) and asylum seekers with a low likelihood of being granted asylum must stay in a reception site until they receive a decision on their case. Article 30 a of the Asylum Act (AsylG) introduced an accelerated procedure, which opens up the possibility to accommodate refugees with a low likelihood of being accepted in five special reception facilities nationwide. The Act on Changes in the Construction Planning and Zoning Law has affected the location and facilities of refugee shelters dramatically. Section § 246, Articles 8 – 13 of the Federal Building Code (BauGB) now enables the location of accommodation in industrial and commercial areas, the exemption from building and use requirements, the conversion of office buildings and warehouses to refugee shelters, and the installation of mobile structures such as tents and containers. In Berlin, the new regulations have resulted in the development of Tempohomes, the conversion of warehouses, commercial and industrial buildings such as the former Tempelhof Airport to refugee accommodation, and the enlargement of emergency shelters, which, before the law changed, did not meet the minimum standards.|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} roles of {{slotting}} and renewal <b>allowances</b> <b>in</b> the allocation of scarce retail shelf space. Several contrasting features of the two shelf allocational mechanisms are shown. With slotting allowances, manufacturers can signal the profitability of new products and retailers can screen out the least profitable products. With re-newal <b>allowances</b> <b>in</b> a full information context, manufacturers can induce retailers to carry their less profitable products, illustrating a "push " ap-proach to attaining shelf placement: manufacturers of product that enjoy strong consumer "pull * obtain shelf placement without paying renewal <b>allowances.</b> <b>In</b> both cases, product proliferation results in higher slotting and renewal allowances by raising the opportunity cost of shelf space. However, as countervailing leverage against retailers, manufacturers of successful product lines can use their successful products to help attain placement for their relatively weak products...|$|R
