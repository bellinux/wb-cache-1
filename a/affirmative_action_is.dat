25|$|Connerly's {{opposition}} {{to affirmative action}} has generated both opposition and support. Connerly believes <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> a form of racism and that people can achieve success without preferential treatment in college enrollment or in employment. He thinks that selective affirmative action discriminates against minorities such as Asian Indians and South East Asians, as some of their people have experienced discrimination in the past, {{but they do not}} receive the benefits of race-based admissions. Critics contend Connerly fails to recognize the damaging extent of past racism for African Americans and Hispanics, that contemporary institutionalized racism is pervasive and powerful, and that affirmative action can overcome the residual effects of past discrimination on people of color.|$|E

During the 2008 presidential campaign, its entry on Obama asserted that he [...] "has no clear personal achievement that cannot be explained as the likely result of affirmative action". Some Conservapedia editors urged that the statement be changed or deleted, but Schlafly, a classmate of Obama, responded by asserting that the Harvard Law Review, the Harvard University legal journal for which Obama and Schlafly worked together, uses racial quotas and stated: [...] "The statement about <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> accurate and {{will remain in the}} entry".

40|$|<b>Affirmative</b> <b>action</b> has <b>been</b> at the {{forefront}} of educational policies and to this day continues to enliven debates. For decades, schools have litigated over whether <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> can <b>be</b> used to create a diverse student body. Now, the litigation has shifted to whether <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> policies <b>are</b> narrowly tailored. The Supreme Court’s most recent <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> case, Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, requires that schools prove that there are no workable race neutral alternatives in order to demonstrate that their <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> programs <b>are</b> narrowly tailored. This article examines the available race neutral alternatives: percentage plans; socioeconomic based admissions policies; elimination of legacy and development admission preferences; recruitment, retention, and financial aid programs; and community outreach. After evaluating their effectiveness, this article concludes that these programs are workable race neutral alternatives that higher education institutions must consider before they resort to using race as a factor in admissions...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the existence of <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> programs may create or exacerbate negative perceptions of groups that benefit from these programs. To test this hypothesis, the authors presented 51 participants with a (fictitious) editorial describing a relatively unfamiliar immigrant group in a positive manner and manipulated whether the group was described as being able to benefit from <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> programs. Participants then rated their perceptions of and attitudes toward the group. Participants also indicated their attitudes and thoughts about the group's immigration and their attitudes toward immigration in general. Results indicated that when <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> <b>was</b> mentioned, participants expressed less favorable perceptions of and attitudes toward the group and were less favorable toward immigration by the group. Interestingly, when <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> <b>was</b> mentioned, participants were also less favorable toward immigration in general. Overall, these findings indicate that the existence of <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> programs can have far-reaching effects on attitudes toward groups...|$|R

It requires contractors to observe their employment patterns. If there is under-representation of women and minorities, “goals and timetables” are created to employ more of the disadvantaged groups on account of gender and race. The pros and cons of affirmative action have been discussed. Some believe discrimination does not exist at all or even it does, prohibiting it is enough, and <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> not needed. Some agree that some <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> needed but they have considerations regarding the use of goals and timetables as they might be too strict.

5000|$|Another {{main reason}} why libertarians tend to oppose <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> {{due to the}} {{macroeconomics}} issues the policy presents. Llewellyn Rockwell, a libertarian author and editor, references Steven Yates' book, [...] "Civil Wrongs: What Went Wrong With Affirmative Action" [...] as an example as to why <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> a policy that libertarians tend to not support. Additionally, Rockwell argues that anti-discrimination laws such as <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> [...] "an inefficient use of labor and intellectual resources." [...] Rockwell reasons that individuals should be hired or accepted to a university based on merit {{rather than having to}} be subjected to affirmative action laws. Because affirmative action laws tend to require a certain quota of majority versus minority individuals being hired or accepted, Rockwell argues that it is possible for an individual belonging to a majority would be rejected in favor of another individual belonging to a minority.|$|E

50|$|<b>Affirmative</b> <b>action</b> {{programs}} <b>are</b> {{often used}} {{as a way to}} make the playing field equal for minority and women owned businesses, and can contribute to the ability for business entry and survival. These programs for women can be considered in terms of education, employment, and business ownership. For women business owners, <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> programs <b>are</b> considered legislation that encourage government agencies and contractors to do business with women-owned businesses. Programs that provide financial, management, and technical assistance to women business owners are also considered to <b>be</b> aspects of <b>affirmative</b> <b>action.</b> <b>Affirmative</b> <b>action</b> legislation has led to substantial improvements in the employment of minorities and women. While <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> independently <b>is</b> not enough to provide opportunities to those facing discrimination or marginalization, evidence suggests that it is beneficial in helping women and minorities to attain more education or economic gains. Ronald Reagan's administration from 1981 to 1989, or during the passage of the Women's Business Ownership Act, was adamantly opposed to <b>affirmative</b> <b>action.</b> There <b>was</b> a concern that the heavy opposition undermined the effectiveness of the policies.|$|R

50|$|After the war {{people coming}} from workers' or farmers' {{families}} were preferred. The system was cancelled around 1956.

This was partially motivated by the Communists seeing the traditional intelligentsia as hostile, and trying to build a new educated class more friendly towards them.
