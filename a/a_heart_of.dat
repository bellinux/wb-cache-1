25|$|Describing the {{original}} Palestinian Kairos document as “a heartfelt, sober, prayerful, urgent {{cry for help}} to end the U.S.-backed Israeli occupation,” the Kairos USA “response” began “with a confession of sin to Palestinians in the State of Israel, the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, the diaspora and in refugee camps in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria.” The authors of the “response” said that “As U.S. Christians we bear responsibility for failing to say 'Enough!' when our nation's ally, the State of Israel, violates international law.” Saying that “the 'peace process' has continued {{to be no more}} than a means for the ongoing colonization of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, the imprisonment of Gaza and the continuation of the structures of oppression,” the authors expressed remorse for the history of Christian anti-Semitism and pledged to “work and even suffer for peace, filled with <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> love for both Israelis and Palestinians.” They then proceeded to describe Israel as “pursuing a course that is fruitless and corrupting, both morally and politically.” Citing the gospels of Matthew and Luke, the authors call for BDS and nonviolent direct action against Israel.|$|E
500|$|Before the {{character}} aired, Deanna Barnert of MSN TV said of DeGarmo: [...] "The young songstress may even prove there's something {{more dangerous than}} a mob wife or a [...] "Jersey Shore" [...] diva: a mob daughter." [...] Michael Logan of TV Guide praised DeGarmo and Angelina as comic relief for the show. Lynette Rice of Entertainment Weekly regarded Angelina as Angelo's ambitious [...] "little angel" [...] and called DeGarmo's casting as [...] "not exactly the next Mariah Carey" [...] a [...] "bit of a twist". Lyndsey Parker of Yahoo! Music called her a: [...] "gum-smacking mob princess with <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> gold".|$|E
500|$|Among Harrison biographers, Simon Leng {{writes that}} the song [...] "trashes the roseate memory of the Beatles". He concludes his {{discussion}} of this [...] "unusually heavy chunk of rock" [...] with the observation: [...] "It's a song of anger and alienation, redolent of betrayal and hostility. To that extent, it's a good-time number to rival Delaney & Bonnie, with <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> pure stone." [...] Noting the production's [...] "layer upon layer of sonic bombast", Elliot Huntley opines that [...] "Spector fans {{must have been in}} seventh heaven" [...] when they first heard [...] "Wah-Wah". Huntley refers to it as [...] "one of the outstanding tracks" [...] of Harrison's career, and a welcome though rare [...] "flat-out, kick-ass rocker" [...] in the singer's canon.|$|E

500|$|The {{scenes with}} Sansa Stark were also noted. According to Elio Garcia from westeros.org, [...] "Sophie Turner really shines in her scenes. There {{are a lot}} of people out there who judge Sansa very harshly, but you would have to have <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> stone not to sympathize with her plight in this episode." [...] Many reviewers agreed with this sentiment, commenting on the {{transition}} from a [...] "spoiled brat" [...] to a young, confused, but courageous teenager were noted by several reviewers positively. Times reviewer James Poniewozik emphasized the growth of Robb Stark's character, praising both Martin's writing and Richard Madden's acting. Maureen Ryan highlighted the scene where Syrio Forel confronts the Lannister men to allow Arya's escape, which she considered masterfully staged.|$|E
500|$|Last Night in Twisted River is John Irving's 12th {{novel and}} his [...] "most ambitious", {{spanning}} five decades from 1954 to 2005 and taking place {{mostly in the}} northeastern United States and southern Ontario in Canada. It is {{about the relationship between}} three men: Dominic Baciagalupo, an Italian-American cook with [...] "the look of a man long resigned to his fate", his son Daniel (Danny), who grows up to be a famous novelist, and Ketchum, a [...] "foul-mouthed logger with <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> gold". The novel is built around its characters and their idiosyncrasies. The father-son relationship between Dominic and Danny is [...] "the heart of the book", and is a departure from Irving's previous novels which generally feature mother-son relationships {{in the absence of a}} father.|$|E
500|$|In the DVD {{commentary}} for the episode, Gilligan {{revealed that}} he wrote {{the character of the}} genie, Jenn, with Janeane Garofalo in mind, but she was unavailable at the time of filming. However, he was ultimately very pleased with Paula Sorge's performance, stating [...] "In fact, she was even better than how I had written the character. In Paula's audition, she came off like a world-weary wise-ass who was not only tough and smart, but had <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> gold. She made it a really fun character." [...] The casting process to find an actress for the part took so long that an idea Gilligan had to give the character double pupils had to be scrapped when the production team ran out of time to source them. Instead, she wore contacts over her already blue eyes to make them brighter, and a blue jewel on her cheekbone.|$|E

500|$|Critics have {{compared}} Gump with various characters and people including Huckleberry Finn, Bill Clinton, and Ronald Reagan. Peter Chomo writes that Gump {{acts as a}} [...] "social mediator and {{as an agent of}} redemption in divided times". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called Gump [...] "everything we admire in the American character – honest, brave, and loyal with <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> gold." [...] The New York Times reviewer Janet Maslin called Gump a [...] "hollow man" [...] who is [...] "self-congratulatory in his blissful ignorance, warmly embraced as the embodiment of absolutely nothing." [...] Marc Vincenti of Palo Alto Weekly called the character [...] "a pitiful stooge taking the pie of life in the face, thoughtfully licking his fingers." [...] Bruce Kawin and Gerald Mast's textbook on film history notes that Forrest Gump's dimness was a metaphor for glamorized nostalgia in that he represented a blank slate by which the Baby Boomer generation projected their memories of those events.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Daphne {{was introduced to}} Neighbours as a [...] "saucy stripper with <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> gold." [...] In their 1989 book, The Neighbours Factfile, Neil Wallis and Dave Hogan wrote that Daphne came from a rich, but uncaring family. They were rarely mentioned on-screen, making her past somewhat of a mystery. Daphne had received a good education and worked in an office as a secretary, until she told her sexist boss to [...] "jump in a lake." [...] Daphne then chose to become a stripper rather than ask her mother, Tina (Beverley Dunn), for a loan. Of Daphne's profession as a stripper, Smith explained [...] "The whole point of Daphne being a stripper is that she's completely counter to the black stockings and garters cliche. She's a bright girl from a good background who gets fed up with being ogled and pinched by men in her secretarial job and says, right I might as well make some money out of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Farrell exalted the lyricism of the song, {{stating that}} [...] "Sophie's music has never sounded so lyrically rich" [...] and her [...] "storytelling skills" [...] were visible in it. Considine named the song a [...] "welcome break from lullabies (such as 'The Deer and the Wolf') that risk monotony" [...] on the album. Conversely, AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{described}} [...] "Love Is a Camera" [...] as a [...] "bogged down in pretension" [...] moment in Wanderlust; Erlewine {{went on to}} criticize the song's [...] "ceaseless pomp". Kate Bennett of musicOMH wrote that [...] "Love Is a Camera" [...] was [...] "more of the same" [...] "heroine-gazing-forlornly-into-the-distance." [...] She elaborated, [...] "You'd have to have <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> cold, igneous rock not to enjoy [...] just a little, {{but if you were}} never a member of your local youth theatre company the sticky-sweetness of it all quickly becomes cloying." [...] The song peaked at number 32 on the UK Airplay Chart, while on the UK Indie chart it reached number 33.|$|E

For example, taking normal QTc ≤ 0.42 s, QT would be expected to be 0.42 s or less at <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> rate <b>of</b> 60 bpm. For <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> rate <b>of</b> 70 bpm, QT would roughly be expected to be equal to or below 0.40 s. Likewise, for 80 bpm, QT would roughly be expected to be equal to or below 0.38 s.|$|R
500|$|Flynn {{is often}} {{regarded}} as one of Disney's most attractive heroes. In 2012, Vanity Fair conducted a poll for which readers were asked to vote for the sexiest Disney hero of all-time. Pairing Flynn against Prince Eric from The Little Mermaid, Flynn beat his competition by less than one percent, garnering 50.35 percent of the total votes. E! ranked the character third in its article [...] "The Definitive Ranking of Disney Princes Based on Overall Dating Eligibility". Writing for Seventeen, YouTube personality Tyler Oakley ranked Flynn the sixth most [...] "dateable" [...] Disney prince. Oakley joked, [...] "I like a man who is unaplogetically himself", continuing, [...] "If you gotta go around with a fake name ... then you're simply not on my level." [...] BuzzFeed author Louis Peitzman ranked Flynn the fourth most attractive Disney prince, praising the character's hair and eyebrows in 2013. BuzzFeed also ranked Flynn second on the website's list of the [...] "Top Ten Hottest Male Cartoon Characters", calling him a [...] "bad boy with <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> gold".|$|E
500|$|Following Aston's death, former {{colleague}} Francis Pryor noted that Aston was a [...] "remarkable archaeologist who could really dig", being a [...] "warm, loving, nice man." [...] Another colleague, Phil Harding, commented on Aston's [...] "incredible knowledge" [...] and [...] "effortless {{way of making}} archaeology accessible to people." [...] Tony Robinson wrote of him: [...] "Mick was a real child of the '60s {{and a bit of}} a rebel, but he was also a series of contradictions. He {{was one of the best}} academic archaeologists in the country, yet his real love was teaching ordinary people. He was the grumpiest old Black Country curmudgeon you could imagine, but he had <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> absolute gold." [...] He also noted that [...] "archaeology is now a subject that tens of thousands of people enjoy and value, and this is almost solely down to him." [...] Ralph Lee, head of Channel 4's factual programming, described Aston as a [...] "brilliant communicator" [...] who helped make archaeology [...] "so popular" [...] in the UK.|$|E
500|$|According to {{film critic}} Roger Ebert, Susie adheres to the Hollywood {{tradition}} of being {{depicted as a}} hooker with <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> gold, while her tough demeanor {{is little more than}} an act. Matt Brunson of Creative Loafing described Susie as a [...] "tough-talking, street-smart" [...] character who is [...] "always ready with a quip (or a sharp counter to a quip)." [...] Writing for The Daily Beast, Elizabeth Kaye identified Susie as [...] "a woman who must battle to keep her emotions from showing". Film Quarterlys Steve Vineberg wrote that the character boasts [...] "a cannily concealed underlayer of childlike dreaminess," [...] comparing her appearance and wardrobe to that of singer Ricky Lee Jones. Wounded by life, Susie wears an [...] "armor" [...] that is both impenetrable yet makes others want to experience more of the character. Kaye felt that the role was especially poignant for Pfeiffer, who in real life had still been recovering from an affair with actor John Malkovich {{at the same time she}} was filming The Fabulous Baker Boys. According to Cinapse's Frank Cavillo, Pfeiffer [...] "had never been as open or vulnerable on screen until starring in The Fabulous Baker Boys." ...|$|E
