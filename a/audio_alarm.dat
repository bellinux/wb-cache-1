These were modules made {{of discrete}} components {{set up as}} logic element circuit groups such as NAND gates, NOR gates, XOR gates, flip flops, monostables, multivibrators, etc. Once tested, the modules were potted in a compound whose colour indicated their function. The coloured potting compound was extremely hard and any attempt to penetrate it resulted in damage to the internal circuitry. In a KG-13, the following colours are confirmed: Pink, Yellow, Green, Blue, Red, Orange and Black. Purple and Brown modules were probably used but those colours are unconfirmed as of this time. Yellow modules were single transistor emitter follower clock drivers. Pink modules were two transistor shift register flip flops. Each yellow module drove nine pink ones. A two transistor multivibrator module drove the <b>audio</b> <b>alarm</b> thru an amplifier. Two transistor monostables were also used. NAND and NOR modules were built from a single transistor and XOR modules were built from two transistors. Failures usually occurred in the power supplies, buffers, and synchronizers though most problems were quickly resolved. When new, there was a high frequency of failures due to cold solder joints. One board in the KG-13 had a black module which was a noise generator containing a Zener diode noise source. This was the only classified module because the noise was used to randomize the key stream on startup. The circuitry inside the module then used the koken chain shift registers to create an pseudo random key stream. That was why {{there was no problem}} in restarting the KG-13 with the same card. The noise source ensured that the chances of duplicating the start point was negligible.|$|E

This report documents the results from Task 8 of that project. The primary objectives of the task was to identify the scope and type of control and monitoring tasks now performed by control-room operators. Another purpose was to address the types of controls and safety systems needed to operate the nuclear plant. The final objective of Task 8 was to identify and categorize the type of information and displays/indicators required to monitor the performance of the control and safety systems. This report also discusses state-of-the-art controls and advanced display devices which will be available for use in control-room retrofits and in control room of future plants. The fundamental types of control and monitoring tasks currently conducted by operators can be divided into four classifications: function monitoring tasks, control manipulation tasks, fault diagnostic tasks, and administrative tasks. There are three general types of controls used in today`s NPPs, switches, pushbuttons, and analog controllers. Plant I and C systems include components to achieve a number of safety-related functions: measuring critical plant parameters, controlling critical plant parameters within safety limits, and automatically actuating protective devices if safe limits are exceeded. The types of information monitored by the control-room operators consist of the following parameters: pressure, fluid flow and level, neutron flux, temperature, component status, water chemistry, electrical, and process and area radiation. The basic types of monitoring devices common to nearly all NPP control rooms include: analog meters, graphic recorders, digital displays and counters, light indicators, visual and <b>audio</b> <b>alarms,</b> and cathode-ray tubes...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design of}} a DSP based air detector system to prevent air embolism during Hemodialysis, which is a treatment option for kidney failure disease. Hemodialysis consists of removing blood from the body, filtering and treating the blood to remove toxic substances such as wastes and fluids, reestablishing proper chemical levels in the blood and returning the processed blood to the body. The functions of hemodialysis are performed {{through the use of a}} dialyzer, which is also known as an artificial kidney. During hemodialysis small air bubbles may infiltrate the tubing used during the therapy and combine to form larger air bubbles that are harmful to the patient. If an air bubble is large enough and enters the patient 2 ̆ 7 s circulatory system, the blood flow can be blocked and the patient can die by embolism. Most of the hemodialysis instruments in use today are equipped with air detection systems, which are based on analog design and digital microcontroll ers. This thesis presents a design method based strictly on DSP technology. The Motorola DSP 56824 EVM was considered suitable for this biomedical application since its performance parameters include high-speed, multi-signal control capability, reliability and stability. These performance parameters are considered to be the most important when designing biomedical instruments dealing with human beings 2 ̆ 7 life and safety. The objective of this research was the development and implementation of a DSP algorithm for the detection and measurement of the sizes of air bubbles in a fluid. In addition the algorithm had to possess the capability, when appropriate, to initiate protective and awareness measures such as triggering a tube clamp as well as activating visual and <b>audio</b> <b>alarms.</b> The air detection was accomplished by means of a commercial air detector module, which was based on piezo ceramic and ultrasound sensing. The function of the tubing clamp was to stop the fluid flow in the tub ing and prevent an air bubble from entering the patient 2 ̆ 7 s circulatory system. A secondary goal of this research was to exploit the capability of the DSP 56824 EVM and demonstrate its suitability for biomedical applications...|$|R

Visibility of the alerting stimuli was measured separately in a control experiment in which the subject maintained steady fixation without the central task.

40|$|Oro-tracheal {{intubation}} {{requires a}} great deal of clinical experience to avoid serious complications. The level of attention needed is even greater in the neonatal field due to newborns’ unique anatomical features. Therefore, specific skill trainers become fundamental in training programs for residents and expert clinicians. However, the current commercial devices are totally passive and, as a result, the operator receives no feedback on the accuracy of the procedure. Materials and Methods: An active sensorized skill trainer for neonatal intubation was designed and assembled by fixing force sensors on a commercial infant simulator. A dedicated user-friendly interface was developed which provided both visual (red or green light) and <b>audio</b> (<b>alarm</b> or winning sound) real-time feedback during intubation. The active neonatal skill trainer was included in a comparative analysis with passive traditional systems, and involved 10 residents in Anesthesiology without previous experience in neonatal intubation. Data on execution times and alarm conditions were gathered. Results: Based on experimental results, the best trainees’ performances were obtained with the active skill trainer after a previous training session with a passive intubation mannequin. In addition, by evaluating the number of sensors-laryngoscope contacts, the superior gingival arch and neck emerged as critical anatomical landmarks contacted during any intubation procedure.

40|$|Inattentional {{deafness}} is {{the failure}} to hear otherwise audible sounds (usually alarms) that may occur under high workload conditions. One potential cause for its occurrence could be an atten- tional bottleneck that occurs when task demands are high, resulting in lack of resources for processing of additional tasks. In this fMRI experiment, we explore the brain regions active during the occurrence of inattentional deafness using a difficult perceptual-motor task in which the participants fly through a simulated Red Bull air race course {{and at the same}} time push a button on the joystick to the presence of audio alarms. Participants were instructed to focus on the difficult piloting task and to press the button on the joystick quickly when they noticed an <b>audio</b> <b>alarm.</b> The fMRI results revealed that audio misses relative to hits had significantly greater activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus IFG and the superior medial frontal cortex. Consistent with an attentional bottleneck, activity in these regions was also present for poor flying performance (contrast of gates missed versus gates passed for the flying task). A psychophysiological interaction analysis from the IFG identified reduced effective connectivity to auditory processing regions in the right superior temporal gyrus for missed audio alarms relative to audio alarms that were heard.

40|$|Introduction When {{properly}} maintained, cyclotrons often {{remain in}} operation for 20 years and more. However, {{as the years}} pass the control systems in particular become challenging to support. The I/O cards and other hardware eventually become obsolete, making spare parts difficult or even impossible to find. And the knowledge and ability to reload and configure the software also gets lost as operating systems and media storage technology change. This obsolescence {{is true of the}} Siemens RDS- 112 cyclotron, which is controlled using a 486 computer, connected to an external STD card rack containing up to 15 I/O cards. These I/O cards were last manufactured in the 1990 ’s, and the iRMX-based control programs malfunction on computers newer than a 486 processor. A control system upgrade for the RDS- 112 cyclotron has been developed by PET Technical Consulting Inc. This commercially available control system reduces operator training time, requires less maintenance, and supports new targets and custom product processes. Material and Methods The availability of high channel count I/O cards, and the decision not to support the old CPCU synthesis units, means the entire STD card rack can be replaced with 5 National Instruments (NI) I/O cards. The replacement computer is an industrial grade rack mounted PC with RAID 1 mirrored pair hard drives in front panel access quick swap bays. Two NI PCI- 6509 Digital I/O cards connect directly to the RDS electronics, channel assignments are mapped using software configuration. Three NI PCI- 6229 Multifunction I/O cards connect to the RDS electronics through a cable breakout interface plate, the terminal blocks are wired as needed to map the channels. The new control software was created using National Instruments LabVIEW. The new control sequences have a core based on the original RDS- 112 FORTRAN control programs. Then hundreds of improvements were made to simplify operation, increase flexibility, minimize user involvement and mistakes, and clearly display key parameters and fault conditions. System control has been combined into a comprehensive Graphical User Interface, with controls and indicators grouped together onto subsystem pages. Commands that once needed to be typed-in have been replaced with a clickable control for each function. Bar graphs display target and slit currents. Status is obvious with red faults against normally green indicators. <b>Audio</b> <b>alarms</b> cue the operator for process interaction, warn if target current or pressure drifts from setpoint, or if faults occur with power supplies, vacuum, or water cooling. Improvements in sequences and beam algorithms have reduced the time to achieve full beam on dual targets from 10 minutes down to 3 minutes. Results and Conclusion This new control system has been installed on (5) five RDS- 112 cyclotrons used for commercial isotope distribution. The total combined operation time of these systems after receiving the upgrade is now over 17 years, during this time the control system operation has been nearly problem free. UPDATE: The Siemens RDS- 111 cyclotron is controlled by a VME computer that is now end-of-life. The VM 30 and VM 42 CPU boards and many of the I/O modules are no longer manu-factured. PET Technical Consulting is developing a control system replacement for the RDS- 111 cyclotron with expected completion in 2014...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This is {{a system}} which helps both the lecturers and parents of {{students}} in an educational institution. In the present system all the activities are done manually.

When there are any recent activities that also updated in a time consuming manner and also lack of various features. Parents get {{to know about the}} details of their ward only when college authorities inform them. Even the graphic user interface (GUI) is missing. The communication is in a single direction. When parents communicate with the college authorities, they cannot get complete details at a time, as the details will be in different departments. In this paper we proposed the system which overcome all the disadvantages. That is, Graphical user interface (a friendly interface) is provided to the user. A parent whenever needed can login and access the student record that is present in SQLite at the server end. He/she can enter the USN of their ward, with a password and check various fields in the record such as marks obtained, fees paid, final results, attendance, counselor’s name etc. Thus they can keep track of their ward and all the necessary updates reach them, without waiting for the college authorities. This application also helps the lecturers/professors query their details such as salary, subjects handled, pass percentage, number of CL, EL etc. Along with this we have provided an <b>audio</b> <b>alarm</b> feature.

As these filters load, the internal fan is required to do more work to push/pull the same volume of air through them. Newer cabinets measure the air flow constantly and self compensate fan performance to ensure constant volumes of air moving through the filters and the cabinet. If the flow drops below desired performance an <b>audio</b> and visual <b>alarm</b> will alert the operator. Changing the filter should be limited to trained persons as the filter is potentially contaminated. This can be done either after the cabinet has been decontaminated using a gaseous procedure (using Formaldehyde, Chlorine Dioxide or Vaporized Hydrogen Peroxide) or a [...] "bag-in/bag-out" [...] procedure.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the project}} ROADSENSE ANR- 10 -VPTT- 010 - 01 is to define a driver {{assistance}} that prevents involuntary out of traffic lanes. A rumble strip producing a vibratory and sound alarm provides this help {{to get back on}} the road. Based on an objective measurement using simple reaction time, the perceptual influence of the vibratory component on the <b>audio</b> component of <b>alarms</b> produced by rumple strips was studied. Two situations were compared: the first one with sound only and the second one with sound and vibration. During this experiment, participants were placed in a semi-realistic driving situation and were asked to press a pedal as soon as possible when they perceived an alarm. Audio-vibration alarms were synthesized by extracting a signal pattern from real recordings of sound and vibrations produced by rumple strips. This pattern (vibration and sound) was repeated using three different inter onset intervals (IOI). Values of reaction times show neither an effect nor an interaction of the vibration component on the audio component of the alarm. However, the influence of the IOI is important; shorter is the IOI better is the reaction time. This result is in agreement with previous results from the literature...|$|R
