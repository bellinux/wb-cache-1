25|$|The Pitt is {{the second}} {{downloadable}} content pack. It allows the player to journey to the industrial raider town known as The Pitt, in the remains of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The pack features several new weapons, new armor and clothing items, four achievements and around four to five hours of gameplay. The Pitt was released on March 24, 2009 on Xbox Live and Games for Windows Live, but was quickly removed due to glitches in the gameplay which made the Xbox 360 version of the expansion unplayable. Further investigation was performed by Bethesda and Microsoft, and on March 25, 2009, the expansion was again uploaded to Xbox Live, and was made available again that <b>afternoon.</b> <b>For</b> those who downloaded it on March 24 in the morning, glitches were still apparent. A new version was available on Xbox Live on April 2, fixing freezing issues many players had encountered with the previous version. A retail disk was released {{at the end of}} May 2009 containing this and the Operation: Anchorage downloadable content. It was released for Xbox 360 and Games for Windows. The downloadable content is copied to the hard drive and function as it would had it been downloaded. This pack was released for the PlayStation 3 {{at the same time as}} Operation Anchorage on October 1, 2009.|$|E

500|$|Kroyanker {{contends that}} not only did the Clal Center fail to revitalize Jaffa Road, it [...] "actually {{accelerated}} its degeneration".

The cocktails are stiff, the beer list is impressive, and the clientele has way fewer nail-biting Reedies than you'd expect." ...|$|E

In late September or early October Hare was visiting Burke when Mrs Ostler (also given as Hostler), a washerwoman, came to the {{property}} to do the laundry. The men got her drunk and killed her; the corpse was with Dr Knox that <b>afternoon,</b> <b>for</b> which the men received £8. A week or two later one of McDougal's relatives, Ann Dougal (also given as McDougal) was visiting from Falkirk; after a few days the men killed her by their usual technique and received £10 for the body. Burke later claimed that about this time Margaret Hare suggested killing Helen McDougal on the grounds that [...] "they could not trust her, as she was a Scotch woman", but he refused.|$|E

500|$|... "Winter" [...] {{is split}} into two parts, broken by a fade out and fade in: [...] "Winter (Hostel-Maxi)" [...] closes Side 1 of the record and [...] "Winter 2" [...] opens Side 2. It was {{described}} by Smith in early press releases as [...] "concerning an insane child who is taken over by a spirit from {{the mind of a}} cooped-up alcoholic". During the intro of [...] "Winter (Hostel-Maxi)", the narrator describes waiting, hung over, in the early <b>afternoon</b> <b>for</b> the pubs to open. The remainder of the song consists of descriptions of and encounters with a dry-out house, a cleaning lady, a feminist wearing anti-nicotine and anti-nuclear badges and a [...] "half-wit" [...] child. After that, the lyrics move towards magic realism and ad-libbed inscrutability: [...] "The mad kid had four lights: the average is two point-five-lights; the mediocre is two lights".|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began on}} December 14, 2004 {{and ran for}} {{four days before the}} cast and crew went on a two-week break over the holiday period. The {{production}} overlapped on December 16 with second-unit filming on the episode [...] "", which required most of the main cast with the exception of Billingsley as Phlox. The opportunity was taken to film the majority of the sequences with Phlox, K'Vagh and Antaak at the same time on a different sound stage so as to not delay the production. After the break, production resumed on January 3, 2005. Minimal shooting was conducted on the first day for [...] "Divergence", as further second-unit filming took place in the <b>afternoon</b> <b>for</b> [...] "United" [...] and for [...] "Babel One". On the second day, Eric Pierpoint and Wayne Grace filmed their scenes as they both appeared on only one set each. Whilst filming was scheduled for seven days, the second-unit filming for [...] "Divergence" [...] pushed into an eighth day on January 6, which overlapped with the production of [...] "".|$|E
500|$|In the 1965–66 NBA {{season the}} Sixers {{experienced}} tragedy when Ike Richman, the Sixers' co-owner {{as well as}} Chamberlain's confidant and lawyer, died of a coronary. The Sixers would post a 55–25 regular season record, and for his strong play, Chamberlain won his second MVP award. In that season, the center again dominated his opposition by recording 33.5 points and 24.6 rebounds a game, leading the league in both categories. In one particular game, Chamberlain blocked a dunk attempt by Gus Johnson so hard that he dislocated Johnson's shoulder. Off the court, however, Chamberlain's commitment to the cause was doubted, as Chamberlain was a late sleeper, lived in New York and preferred to commute to Philadelphia rather than live there, and he was only available during the <b>afternoon</b> <b>for</b> training. Because Schayes {{did not want to}} risk angering his best player, he scheduled the daily workout at 4 pm; this angered the team, who preferred an early schedule to have the afternoon off, but Schayes just said: [...] "There is no other way." [...] Irv Kosloff, who now owned the Sixers alone after Richman's death, pleaded to him to move to Philadelphia during the season, but he was turned down.|$|E
