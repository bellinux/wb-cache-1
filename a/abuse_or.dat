5|$|On February 2, 2015, Cody {{was indicted}} on animal cruelty and drug charges by a Baltimore County grand jury. The {{indictment}} included 15 charges: Two counts of aggravated animal cruelty involving a dog, five counts of animal <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> neglect involving the same dog, {{one count of}} illegal possession of an alligator, five counts of animal <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> neglect involving the alligator, one count of possession with intent to use the drug paraphernalia, and one count of possession of marijuana. Cody's agent, Peter Schaffer, denied his client's guilt and said that Cody's dog died of worms {{and that there was}} no animal cruelty. The investigating veterinarian said the dog was neglected and starved to death.|$|E

5|$|A {{decade after}} the fact, during {{the second round of}} child abuse allegations, Jackson's lawyers would file a memo stating that the 1994 {{settlement}} was made without his consent. A later disclosure by the FBI of investigation documents compiled over nearly 20 years led Jackson's attorney to suggest that no evidence of molestation or sexual impropriety from Jackson toward minors existed. According to reports, the Department of Children and Family Services (Los Angeles County) investigated Jackson beginning in 1993 with the Chandler allegation and again in 2003. Reports show the LAPD and DCFS did not find credible evidence of <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> sexual misconduct.|$|E

5|$|Clinicians {{assess the}} {{physical}} aspects {{such as the}} appearance of a patient, including apparent age, height, weight, and manner of dress and grooming. Colorful or bizarre clothing might suggest mania, while unkempt, dirty clothes might suggest schizophrenia or depression. If the patient appears much older than his or her chronological age this can suggest chronic poor self-care or ill-health. Clothing and accessories of a particular subculture, body modifications, or clothing not typical of the patient's gender, might give clues to personality. Observations of physical appearance might include the physical features of alcoholism or drug abuse, such as signs of malnutrition, nicotine stains, dental erosion, a rash around the mouth from inhalant <b>abuse,</b> <b>or</b> needle track marks from intravenous drug abuse. Observations can also include any odor which might suggest poor personal hygiene due to extreme self-neglect, or alcohol intoxication. Weight loss could also signify a depressive disorder, physical illness, anorexia nervosa or chronic anxiety.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Nash {{formed the}} Steve Nash Foundation. Through grants {{to public service}} and nonprofit entities, the {{foundation}} aims to foster health in kids by funding projects that provide services to children affected by poverty, illness, <b>abuse,</b> <b>or</b> neglect, and create opportunity for education, play, and empowerment. It focuses its resources on communities in Phoenix, Arizona, and British Columbia, Canada. It was given charitable status in 2004. This foundation was awarded the Steve Patterson Award for Excellence in Sports Philanthropy in 2008. Nash also founded the Jim Jennings Memorial Endowment Fund, established in honour of a volunteer staff member at Santa Clara University who served the basketball team for more than 20 years.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{high-profile}} Senate committee inquiries was the Senate Select Committee on a Certain Maritime Incident, which in 2002 investigated {{what became known as}} the Children Overboard Affair. The events and subsequent Senate committee inquiries were widely reported, and the transcripts of the inquiry formed the basis of a play, A Certain Maritime Incident. Other high-profile inquiries included the Community Affairs committee's inquiry into Children in Institutional Care, which brought to wide public notice the experiences of children who had been placed in care in sometimes inhumane circumstances and was directly responsible for state governments and churches making public apologies to the victims of <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> neglect; the Select Committee on Mental Health, which contributed to widespread discussion of mental health issues and to a major funding boost for services in 2006; and the 2006 inquiry into the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill, which contributed to a government decision not to proceed with controversial migration legislation.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on some problems of maltreated, <b>abused</b> <b>or</b> neglected children and it also tries to outline a contemporary view of this situation. Considerable changes occured in this field after breaking a taboo on this subject, which {{is presented as a}} topic for a wide discussion. In my work I tried to give a complex view of some aspects of maltreated, <b>abused</b> <b>or</b> neglected children problems. Furthemore I focused on the problems of a public awareness concerning maltreated, <b>abused</b> <b>or</b> neglected children, and possible public activities in this field. I also investigated a public awareness of civic associations (i. e. organisations, institutions or facilities) which take care of endangered children in Trhové Sviny and nearby sorroundings. This research was based on a standardised questionaire. According to an analysis of its results, it is possible to to state a negation of both hypotheses in which I originally considered a public awareness of maltreated, <b>abused</b> <b>or</b> neglected children low, or likewise, I pressumed that a public awareness of the above mentioned organisations (civic associations, institutions) would not be very high. In spite of these conclusions it is a safe assumption that the tasks given to find out a situation in a public awareness concerning the endangered children, were fulfilled...|$|R
