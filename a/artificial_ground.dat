Islands fabricated from ice are becoming more prevalent as offshore oil speculation in the Arctic gains more interest. Ice has been a strategic building material in the Arctic for the construction of roads, airstrips, housing, and, in the last few decades, as temporary drilling platforms to explore for oil. This article describes various methods of artificial ice building, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} using man-made ice islands for exploratory drilling...|$|R

5000|$|Originally {{known as}} WALE, the call sign moved to 990 AM in Providence, Rhode Island on July 20, 1989. On that date, SNE Broadcasting Ltd. (owned by local {{businessmen}} Robert and James Karam) took ownership of 1400 AM and introduced the WHTB call sign. The station's first location {{was at the}} corner of North Main Street and Central Street in Fall River, Massachusetts, known as the Durfee Theatre Building. The station's [...] "Whale" [...] was a plaster and chicken wire figure atop the building with the words [...] "WALE 1400" [...] on the sides in white paint. The transmitting antenna was on the roof and had a copper screen ground system. There was no real ground connection to the antenna, and the screen created an <b>artificial</b> <b>grounding</b> system, limiting the coverage area.|$|R

40|$|The {{expression}} 'nature of the artificial' can {{be understood}} in (at least) two distinct, yet possibly related, senses as denoting (i) the essence (or whatness) of the artificial, and (ii) that which stands as a given 'other' to the artificial. Recently, Negrotti [1] has developed a sophisticated mimetic theory of the <b>artificial</b> <b>grounded</b> in three notions - observation, exemplar, and essential performance - that attempts to articulate the former. In this paper, it will be argued that, notwithstanding the merits of this scheme, principal of which are the self-evident simplicity of its conceptual foundations and its possible overall correctness, it suffers {{from a number of}} drawbacks. These can be shown to follow from what are, in fact, highly problematic metaphysical assumptions about the nature (as essence) of nature (as 'other' to the artificial). For example, Negrotti is committed to the following three metaphysical theses (among others) : (1) there are two 'orders' of natural reality, t [...] ...|$|R

50|$|The {{radiation}} pattern {{and even the}} driving point impedance of an antenna can {{be influenced by the}} dielectric constant and especially conductivity of nearby objects. For a terrestrial antenna, the ground is usually one such object of importance. The antenna's height above the ground, as well as the electrical properties (permittivity and conductivity) of the ground, can then be important. Also, in the particular case of a monopole antenna, the ground (or an <b>artificial</b> <b>ground</b> plane) serves as the return connection for the antenna current thus having an additional effect, particularly on the impedance seen by the feed line.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{new test}} methodology to obtain {{data to be}} used to evaluate ultimate seismic behavior of Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) structures. In this paper, we firstly reviews existing seismic test data with emphasis on Soil Structure Interaction (SSI) of NPP structures from the viewpoint of the evaluation of their earthquake response behavior. Secondary, we extracts the issues in the existing data with regard to their applicability to the evaluation of earthquake response of the NPP structures when a big earthquake ground motion strikes them. Then we propose new test methodology for NPP structures to evaluate their ultimate seismic response behavior for a strong earthquake ground motion. The test methodology employs <b>artificial</b> earthquake <b>ground</b> motions generated in a surface coalmine that has a large acceleration up to 2 g. The simulation analysis is carried out by applying an observed large <b>artificial</b> earthquake <b>ground</b> motion at the coalmine to a scaled NPP reactor building model. Then we confirm its applicability to the test to evaluate ultimate earthquake response behavior of the NPP structures. The test methodology present herein is cost effective for obtaining the test data. The test data are indispensable for evaluating properly the seismic safety margins of NPPs...|$|R
