5|$|In {{contrast}} to extracellular fluid, cytosol {{has a high}} concentration of potassium ions and a low concentration of sodium ions. This difference in ion concentrations is critical for osmoregulation, since if the ion levels were the same inside a cell as outside, water would enter constantly by osmosis - since the levels of macromolecules inside cells <b>are</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> their levels outside. Instead, sodium ions are expelled and potassium ions taken up by the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase, potassium ions then flow down their concentration gradient through potassium-selection ion channels, this loss of positive charge creates a negative membrane potential. To balance this potential difference, negative chloride ions also exit the cell, through selective chloride channels. The loss of sodium and chloride ions compensates for the osmotic effect of the higher concentration of organic molecules inside the cell.|$|E

30|$|To {{illustrate}} this {{feature of the}} model, Fig.  5 depicts the value functions associated with honoring the outstanding debt obligations, receiving financial aid and defaulting. These value functions assume a fixed value of output. One then can identify four regions. In region 1 (R 1), the value of defaulting <b>is</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> the other two value functions (i.e., paying and financial aid), therefore, defaulting on the outstanding debt is the optimal solution. In region 2 (R 2), the value of receiving financial aid <b>is</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> the other two value functions (i.e., defaulting and paying). In addition, the value of defaulting <b>is</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> the value of honoring the outstanding debt. Accordingly, in this region, financial aid prevents a default episode. In region 3 (R 3), the value of receiving financial aid <b>is</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> the value of paying back debt and the latter <b>is</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> the value of defaulting. Therefore, financial aid works as a subsidy. In region 4 (R 4), the value of honoring the outstanding debt <b>is</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> the other two value functions (i.e., defaulting and financial aid). This has as a repercussion that the agent will not default regardless of official aid.|$|R

5|$|Fares on BART are {{comparable}} to those of commuter rail systems and <b>are</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> those of most subways, especially for long trips. The fare is based on a formula that takes into account both the length and speed of the trip. A surcharge is added for trips traveling through the Transbay Tube, to Oakland International Airport, to San Francisco International Airport, and/or through San Mateo County, a county that is {{not a member of the}} San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District. Passengers can use refillable paper-plastic-composite tickets, on which fares are stored via a magnetic strip, to enter and exit the system. The exit faregate prints the remaining balance on the ticket each time the passenger exits the station. A paper ticket can be refilled at a ticket machine, the remaining balance on any ticket can be applied towards the purchase of a new one, or a card is captured by the exit gate when the balance reaches zero; multiple low value cards can be combined to create a larger value card but only at specific ticket exchange locations, located at some BART stations. The magnetic strip-based technology was developed by Cubic Transportation Systems with a contract awarded in 1974.|$|E
