He asked her for <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> which she gave him and then discussed the proximity of Broadmoor {{and the likelihood of}} escapes. After 10 minutes, he left. An hour and a half later, he reached Farley Hill, and at about five o'clock, Straffen came to the point where 5-year-old Linda Bowyer was riding her bicycle around the village. Within half an hour, Bowyer was dead.|$|E

There is a long silence as the two stare at each other before the curtain comes down.|$|E
25|$|Mind in the ToK system {{refers to}} the set of mental {{behaviors}}. Mental behaviors are behaviors of animals mediated by the nervous system that produce a functional effect on the animal-environment relationship. As such, Mind is essentially synonymous with what behavioral psychologists have meant when they use the term behavior. Thus, a fly avoiding a fly swatter, a rat pushing a bar or a human getting <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> are all mental behaviors. Mind is not synonymous with sentience or the capacity for mental experience, although such processes are presumed {{to emerge in the}} mental dimension. Cognition, in the broad sense of the term (i.e., as meaning neuro-information processing) is seen as covert mental behavior, whereas change between the animal and the environment is defined as overt mental behavior. Thus, by defining mind as mental behavior, Henriques argues that the ToK System provides a way to bridge the epistemological differences between cognitive and behavioral science.|$|E

25|$|The {{novel is}} divided into eight books, or parts, {{each with its own}} subchapters. Book one opens with the story of the three Magi, who arrive in Bethlehem to hear the news of Christ’s birth. Readers meet the fictional {{character}} of Judah {{for the first time in}} book two, when his childhood friend Messala, also a fictional character, returns to Jerusalem as an ambitious commanding officer of the Roman legions. The teen-aged boys come to realize that they have changed and hold very different views and aspirations. When a loose tile is accidentally dislodged from the roof of Judah's house during a military parade and strikes the Roman governor, knocking him from his horse, Messala falsely accuses Judah of attempted assassination. Although Judah is not guilty and receives no trial, he is sent to the Roman galleys for life; his mother and sister are imprisoned in a Roman jail, where they contract leprosy; and all the family property is confiscated. Judah first encounters Jesus, who offers him <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and encouragement, as Judah is being marched to a galley to be a slave. Their lives continue to intersect as the story unfolds.|$|E
25|$|Kelly's first {{documented}} {{brush with}} the law was on 15 October 1869 {{at the age of}} 14 when he was charged with the assault and robbery of Ah Fook, a pig and fowl trader of Chinese descent from Bright. According to Fook, as he was passing Kelly's house, Kelly approached him with a long bamboo stick, announcing that he was a bushranger and would kill him if he did not hand over his money. Kelly then allegedly took him into the bush, beat him with the stick and stole 10 shillings. According to Kelly, his sister Annie and two witnesses, Bill Skilling and Bill Grey, Annie was sitting outside the house sewing when Fook walked up and asked for <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> Given creek water, he abused Annie for not giving him rain water, and Kelly came outside and pushed him. Fook then hit Kelly three times with the bamboo stick, causing him to run away. The visitor then walked away, threatening to return and burn the house down, and Kelly did not return until sundown. Historians find neither account convincing and believe that Kelly's account is likely true up to being hit by Fook but then Kelly probably took the stick from him and beat him with it.|$|E

She was named after her paternal great-grandmother, who was born Princess Elisabeth of Prussia. Her paternal aunt had the same name and was also nicknamed Ella.

500|$|Further into chapter 38, Gangleri asks if Odin consumes {{the same}} meals as the einherjar. High {{responds}} that Odin gives {{the food on}} his table to his two wolves Geri and Freki, and that Odin himself needs no food, for Odin gains sustenance from wine {{as if it were}} drink and meat. High then quotes another stanza from Grímnismál in reference. In chapter 39, Gangleri asks what the einherjar drink that is as plentiful as their food, and if they drink water. High responds that it is strange that Gangleri is asking if Odin, the All-Father, would invite kings, earls, and other [...] "men of rank" [...] to his home and give them water to drink. High says that he [...] "swears by his faith" [...] that many who come to Valhalla would think that he paid a high price for <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> if there were no better beverages there, after having died of wounds and in agony. High continues that atop Valhalla stands the goat Heiðrún, and it feeds on the foliage of the tree called Læraðr. From Heiðrún's udders flow mead that fills a vat a day. The vat is so large that all of the einherjar are able to drink to their fullness from it.|$|E
500|$|Morrison's lyrics on Moondance {{deal with}} themes of spiritual renewal and redemption. It {{departed}} from Astral Weeks discursive, stream-of-consciousness narratives as the singer balanced his spiritual ideas with more worldly subject matter, which biographer Johnny Rogan felt offered the record {{a quality of}} [...] "earthiness". As a counterpart to Astral Weeks, AllMusic critic Jason Ankeny believed it [...] "retains the previous album's deeply spiritual thrust but transcends its bleak, cathartic intensity" [...] by rejoicing in [...] "natural wonder". According to Christgau, the essence of Morrison's spirit was, much like the African-American music that inspired him, [...] "mortal and immortal simultaneously: {{this is a man}} who gets stoned on <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and urges us to turn up our radios all the way into the mystic." [...] His [...] "giddy" [...] preoccupation with [...] "natural wonder" [...] on the album was a product of the new approach to composition and the mellow feel of his new band, Harrington said. In his opinion, the record's exuberant spirit and theme of self-affirmation were partly inspired by the singer having [...] "settled into a life of domestic bliss". Musicologist Brian Hinton argued that Morrison was celebrating a [...] "natural alternative" [...] in his music after quitting soft drugs around this time because they had impeded his productivity.|$|E

[...] Headed for the highway, I knew the horse would turn in the right direction. I didn't know what the right direction was. And the horse trotted and galloped along. Now and then he would forget he was on the highway and start into a field. So I would pull on him a bit and call his attention to the fact the highway was where he was supposed to be. And finally, about four miles from where I had boarded him, he turned into a farm yard and the farmer said, [...] "So that's how that critter came back. Where did you find him?"

[...] Within five hours of the crash {{more than a thousand}} people had arrived to strip the hulk of anything they could carry. [...] On Saturday, 5 September 1925, the St. Petersburg Times of Florida reported that the site of the crash had quickly been looted by locals, describing the frame as being [...] " [...] carrion to the whims of souvenir seekers". [...] Among the items believed to have been taken were the vessel's logbook and its barograph, both of which were considered critical to understanding how the crash had happened. [...] Also looted were many of the ship's 20 deflated silken gas cells, each worth several thousand dollars, most of them unbroken but ripped from the framework before the arrival of armed military personnel. [...] Looting was so extensive that it was initially believed even the bodies of the dead had been stripped of their personal effects, and that operatives from the Department of Justice were being sent to investigate. [...] That this was happening was soon denied by those publicly involved in the incident, however. [...] Still, a local farmer on whose property part of the vessel's wreckage lay began charging the throngs of visitors to enter the crash site at a rate of $1 (equivalent to about $13.60 in 2015) for each automobile and 25¢ per pedestrian as well as 10¢ for <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
2500|$|During {{the fall}} of 1986, roughly 100 PBS {{stations}} carried The Mechanical Universe, and by {{the fall of}} 1987, over 600 higher-education institutions had purchased it or licensed the episodes for use. In 1992, Goodstein noted that the series had been broadcast, via PBS, by over 100 stations, [...] "usually at peculiar hours when innocent people were unlikely to tune in accidentally on a differential equation in the act of being solved". He observed that detailed viewership figures were difficult to obtain, but when the show had been broadcast in Miami during Saturday mornings, the producers were able to obtain Nielsen ratings.In fact, it came in second in its time slot, beating the kiddie cartoons on two network stations. There were 18,000 faithful core households in Dade County alone, the median age of the viewers was 18, and half were female. However, we seldom get that kind of detailed information.Goodstein and assistant project director Richard Olenick noted,Anecdotal information in the form of letters and phone calls indicates very considerable enthusiasm among users at all levels from casual viewers to high-school students to research university professors, but there have also been a number of sharp disappointments, particularly when Instructional Television administrators have tried to handle TMU like a conventional telecourse.Similarly, a 1988 review in Physics Today suggested that the programs would not function well on their own as a telecourse, but would work much better as a supplement to a traditional classroom or a more standard distance-learning course such as Open University. The reviewers also found the [...] "algebraic ballet" [...] of computer-animated equations too fast to follow: [...] "After a short time, one yearns for a live professor filling the blackboard with equations". Similarly, a review in the American Journal of Physics, while praising the [...] "technical proficiency of the films", wrote of the animated equation manipulations, [...] "As the MIT students say, this is like trying to take <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> out of a fire hose". A considerably more enthusiastic evaluation came from physicist Charles H. Holbrow, who told Olenick, [...] "These materials will constitute the principal visual image of physics for decades". Goodstein and Olenick reported that younger viewers tended to enjoy the [...] "algebraic ballet" [...] style [...] "much more than older viewers, who are made uncomfortable by the algebraic manipulations they cannot quite follow".|$|E
