40|$|The current {{performance}} of organic farms {{in relation to}} animal health often does not surpass the level of conventional production and does not always meet the self-proclaimed aims and {{the expectations of the}} consumers. Taking into consideration the specific characteristics of multi-factorial diseases and the need for appropriate living conditions, the question arises which obstacles are decisive for the current situation and need to be changed in order to improve <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> Taking the system approach of organic farming into account, several theses in relation to the most relevant obstacles are discussed. Obstacles seem to be evident in relation to deficits concerning the perception of health problems, lack of a clear goal in relation to the acceptable <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> lack of resources and limitations to think through the complexity of the processes within the farm system. It is concluded that {{there seems to be no}} realistic chance to improve <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>status</b> in organic farms without a change in paradigm from a standard to an output oriented approach. Simul-taneously, efforts and success in health management have to be honoured by pre-mium prices. ...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{farming is}} often {{directly}} {{associated with an}} enhanced level of animal health and welfare. However, in spite of ongoing efforts {{in the fields of}} animal science, the <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>status</b> in organic dairy farming does not in all respect meet consumers’ expectations. Reasons are manifold and differ considerably between farms as do the multi-factorial production diseases. Success of animal health planning highly depends on a sound diagnostic procedure at farm level and farmers’ intrinsic motivation to improve the <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> Both aspects are essential preconditions for the identification and implementation of the most appropriate farm-specific management measures. The aim {{of this paper is to}} introduce a participatory and farm-centric methodological approach, facilitating the comprehension of farm specific processes and encouraging farmers to increase <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> The system ‘organic dairy farm’ is described and vital key variables that play a role in the way the system behaves are determined in intensive workshops involving relevant stakeholders. On the basis of farm protocols, milk recordings, and animal based measurements the <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>status</b> is determined for each farm and discussed in a ‘round table’ situation involving the different perspectives of the farmer himself, the local veterinarian and an agricultural advisor. By making use of the impact matrix as an innovative diagnostic tool to deal with the complexity of the farm system, the interconnectedness of 13 system variables is assessed at farm level. The method is used to gain a comprehensive insight from different perspectives and achieve agreement about the systemic functional role of relevant factors involved in the development of multi-factorial production diseases. Based on the on-farm assessment and the impact matrix analysis the discussion results in the formulation of farm-individual goals and the identification of measures that are expected to most likely improve animal health in the farm specific situation taking into account the availability of resources. The participatory process facilitates knowledge exchange and collective learning. For animal health planning to be effective, farm-specific interconnections have to be taken into account instead of focussing on general recommendations. The impact matrix analysis promises to be an effective method to reduce the complexity of the farm system and to identify measures which can be expected to have a relevant impact on the <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> Thus, reducing health problems deriving from complex interactions is expected to benefit from the integration of different perspectives...|$|E

Since the ban in 2006 of antibiotic {{growth promoters}} in the European Union, {{the search for}} suitable natural alternative to antibiotic growth promoters with similar beneficial effects has been intensified. Among possible alternatives are phytogenic feed additives (PFA) which may positively affect poultry health and productivity. Many non-therapeutic substitutes (prebiotics, probiotics and symbiotics), especially plants extracts {{from a wide variety}} of herbs, spices and derivatives, have already been used as a feed additive in poultry. Recent studies on these compounds have shown some positive effects (antimicrobial, antioxidant and regulator of the gut flora) in poultry production.

30|$|Based on our observations, we {{recommend}} that these surrogate markers be used in murine sepsis studies for several reasons. First, these tools offer a general non-invasive assessment of disease progression and are amenable to high monitoring frequency, unlike repetitive blood sampling which {{has been shown to}} reduce red blood cell count and hemoglobin concentrations after 5  days of sampling only 35  μL daily [26]. Second, evaluation of symptoms provides easily accessible information regarding the change in an <b>animal’s</b> <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> facilitating macroscopic monitoring of the physiologic response when testing novel therapeutic interventions or effects of comorbidities. Lastly, monitoring of vital signs improves the clinical relevance of experimental sepsis studies, and our study shows that core body temperature measured using a rectal thermometer is an objective marker of sepsis progression and death. Therefore, {{we recommend}} that body temperature be routinely monitored in CLP studies and, based on our data, body temperature below 30  °C or a reduction in body temperature of >[*] 5  °C could be utilized as thresholds to replace death as an endpoint in mouse CLP studies involving male C 57 Bl/ 6 J mice.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>status</b> and product quality in organic pig production a survey {{was carried out}} on 21 farms. Implementation of farm management and hygiene measures was assessed by using a concept based on critical control points (CCP). <b>Animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>status</b> was estimated by examinations of the carcass at the abattoir, taking nearly 50, 000 pigs into account of which 4132 pigs derived from the assessed organic pig farms. One of the main pathological findings were “milk spots” in the liver and lung diseases. Spot sampling of blood analysed for antibodies versus mycoplasma and salmonella revealed {{that most of the}} animals had contact to the pathogen agents. Carcass quality rated in the EUROP-System was lower in organic compared to conventional farms; mean intramuscular fat content and pH 1 showed no preference for organic pork. The results indicate that most of the assessed organic pig farms did not met the high demands in relation to animal health and quality assurance. Insufficient feedback by the way of the market price and missing health and quality control schemes are jointly responsible for existing deficits and offer the options to improve the current situation. ...|$|E

40|$|Rabies is {{of great}} public health {{importance}} because it is almost universally fatal without timely intervention. Approximately over 60, 000 people die from rabies each year. Canine rabies accounts for over 90 % of human rabies cases worldwide and disproportionately affects the poorest population in Asia and Africa. The disability-adjusted life years due to rabies {{is estimated to be}} 1. 9 million. The economic burden of rabies is US$ 6 billion globally. Rabies is often misdiagnosed due to limitation in ante-mortem diagnosis and the clinical signs often resemble encephalitis. Cost of rabies biologics is often a huge barrier to treatment for many in the developing countries. Canine rabies can be eliminated as demonstrated in North America and Western Europe. An integrative approach combining veterinary and human health services with commitment from local governments and support from international agencies is required for elimination to be successful and sustainable. In regions where canine rabies has been eliminated, continuing surveillance and maintaining adequate vaccine coverage are imperative to prevent re-emergence of canine rabies. In the U. S. where wildlife is the main reservoir for rabies, it is crucial to prevent spill over infection from wildlife into domestic animals. The Allegheny County Health Department in Western Pennsylvania processed 367 domestic animals during 2012, which accounts {{for more than half of}} all the animals submitted. The analysis to better understand the high number of domestic animals and to assess the reason for each domestic animal submission was done. The findings showed that key pieces of information that determine the need for rabies testing are often missing.

30|$|The {{correlation}} between the volume measurement on pre-inoculation CT scans 1 and 2, 1 and 3, and 2 and 3 was calculated using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (r). Application of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test [18] confirmed {{that the difference between}} the pairs of scans followed a Gaussian distribution. To investigate the interscan reproducibility of three baseline scans, we compared scans 1 and 2, 1 and 3, and 2 and 3 for LN volumes and SUVmean, SUVmax, SUVthreshold, mSUVthreshold, and SUVfixed volume using Bland-Altman analysis [19]. The mean difference, standard deviation of the mean differences (SD), coefficient of repeatability (CR), and limits of agreement (LoA) were calculated and represented as Bland-Altman plots. The SD was calculated by squaring all the differences, adding them up, dividing them by the number of measurements, and taking the square root. The LoA were calculated by adding (upper limit) or subtracting (lower limit) the CR, defined as CR = 1.96 × SD, from the mean difference. This analysis of data reproducibility was performed with the assumption that the <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>status</b> did not change during the time the scans were obtained 5 to 21 days prior to monkeypox virus inoculation.

40|$|Many feed {{additives}} {{are designed to}} secure <b>animal’s</b> <b>health</b> <b>status</b> and to optimize growth performance. Among others, antibiotics {{have been used as}} growth promoters {{for a number of years}} in intensive animal production systems. However, the increasing public concern over the production of food from animals has led to worries about the routine use of antibiotics in animal production. It is now feared that antibiotic residues could get into food for human consumption. The use of antibiotics as promoters of animal performance in the EU was banned by January 2006 (Øverland et al., 2003). Inborr (2000) has reported that with the aid of number of alternatives including probiotics, prebiotics (mainly oligosaccharides) and feed enzymes not only has the general <b>health</b> <b>status</b> of the poultry been maintained, but also the growth performance and feed efficiency improved. The aim of our research project was to determine the effect of different prebiotics - mannanooligosccharides, fructooligosaccharides and enzymes on broiler chickens growth performance and meat sensory attributes. To realize this aim, we conducted two experiments: 1. Effects of enzymes RovabioTMExcel AP and prebiotics mannanoligosaccharides Agrimoss on broiler chickens body weight, feed conversion (kg feed/kg weight gain), mortality, breast and leg meat pH, breast fatty acids concentration and breast and leg meat sensory attributes. 400 broiler chickens were allocated to two groups and for 35 days were fed basal diet (control) and basal diet suplemented with enzymes RovabioTMExcel AP and mannanoligosaccharides Agrimoss. 2.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{goal of this}} beef {{checkoff}} sponsored symposium was {{to provide}} clarity regarding cattle well-being, research, {{the current state of}} the industry, and the future of cattle transportation in North America. In today’s marketing programs, feeder calves might be transported as many as 6 times. Loading conditions, time in transit, weather conditions, commingling, segregation of different sexes and weight classes into separate trailer compartments, driver experience, <b>animal</b> nutrition, <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> and physical condition are all factors to be considered when transporting cattle. Transportation related live weight loss (shrink) is not only attributed to loss of gut fill but also tissue loss, which can exceed 60 % of total BW loss. High ambient temperature and rough handling of cattle significantly increase the amount of shrink incurred by cattle. If following best management practices could result in a 1 % decrease in shrink among the feeder cattle shipped at least once in the United States, the economic benefit would exceed $ 325 million dollars.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is {{a devastating}} {{pathogen}} that {{is associated with}} high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Livestock are a well-known reservoir for this pathogen, which poses substantial health risks for livestock workers. Little is known about the epidemiology of livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA) among livestock workers in Eastern Europe. MethodsTo study the epidemiology of LA-MRSA among swine workers in Romania, we collected and characterized nasal and oropharygneal samples from swine workers on commercial pig farms. A survey that included questions about work-related tasks, biosafety practices, contact with <b>animals,</b> and <b>health</b> <b>status</b> was used to assess the risk factors that were potentially associated with LA-MRSA colonization. ResultsThe prevalence of MRSA colonization among swine workers was 6. 8 %. Two LA-MRSA strains with the spa types t 034 and t 011 and one likely community-associated MRSA strain with the spa type t 321 were isolated from workers on five farms. Interestingly, all MRSA carriers worked on farms that imported animals from other production facilities. ConclusionThis is the first study to confirm the presence of LA-MRSA among swine workers in Romania and suggests the need to minimize the risk of LA-MRSA-related infections in swine workers and their community contacts. The findings also suggest a link between the commercial movement of swine and the introduction of LA-MRSA...|$|R

CarpenterIn many species, {{temporary}} {{increases in}} glucocorticoids (GC) {{can be used}} to identify changes in adrenal activity in response to acute stressors. For this research, GC metabolites were identified in fecal extracts from various Atelopus species. The objectives were to identify possible correlates between GCs and <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> assess the impact of husbandry protocols on adrenal activity, and evaluate the sub-lethal effects of antifungal bacteria used for protection of frogs against the chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Bd). The first study examined whether fecal GC concentrations can be correlated with <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> and behavior changes in a captive setting. Atelopus zeteki with varying degrees of dermatitis were categorized based on the severity of their skin abnormalities and GC metabolite concentrations were analyzed to detect correlations between severity of disease and GC metabolite concentrations. Similarly, behaviors that may indicate elevated stress levels (e. g., time spent in hide) were analyzed to detect correlation between disease and behavior changes. There was no correlation between fecal GC metabolites and <b>health</b> <b>status</b> of the <b>animal</b> or between <b>health</b> <b>status</b> and amount of time spent in hide. The second study established ex situ colonies of two Panamanian frog species, Atelopus certus and Atelopus glyphus, to determine how male group size affects behavior and GC levels. When housed in groups of eight, animals initially had elevated GC concentrations and interacted aggressively, but these instances declined substantially in the first 2 weeks of being housed together. Thus, captive Atelopus populations can be housed in same-sex enclosures without causing sub-lethal stress on the individuals involved. The third study examined the ability of antifungal bacterium from Central America to propagate on Atelopus skin as a preventative treatment for Bd and the sub-lethal effects of each bacteria species on adrenal function based on GC analysis. Four species of bacteria (Pseudomonas sp., Pseudomonas putida, Chryseobacterium indolgenes, and Stenotrophomonas maltophili) were found to be successful Bd inhibitors in vitro. There were no detectable effects of bacterial exposure with GC metabolite concentrations over time for any of the treatments assessed...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial {{disease is}} a major {{constraint}} on the efficient production of animal derived food and causes ill health and suffering in both food producing and companion animals. In some production systems the spread of bacterial disease may be accelerated by {{the proximity of the}} animals. Bacterial disease may be controlled in some situations by eradication, maintenance of <b>animals</b> of specified <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> vaccination, and good hygiene. Nevertheless, antimicrobial chemotherapy remains vitally important for treating and in some cases preventing bacterial disease. Many bacterial diseases of animals are potentially fatal; others cause pain and distress. Appropriate use of antimicrobials will cure some sick animals and speed the recovery of others, and may improve the welfare of treated animals and reduce the spread of infection to other animals or, in the case of zoonotic disease, to humans. The challenge is to use antimicrobials wisely, minimising the risk of resistanc...|$|R
40|$|Essential {{oils and}} their components, {{as a group}} of phytogenic feed additive, have great {{potential}} uses in broiler fattening. Due to their antimicrobial and antioxidant properties and effects on improved food digestibility their positive impact on <b>animals</b> the <b>health</b> <b>status</b> can be expected, and therefore better final fattening results. In this research we studied the impact of XTRACTTM (a combination of essential oils components carvacrol, cinnamaldehid and capsicum Oleoresin), Arom Korm ® (essential oil combination of Foeniculum vulgare and Citrus limon), zeolite and a combination of zeolite with XTRACTTM or Aroma Korma ® on the fattening performance of chickens, their immunostimulating effect, the impact on the antioxidant status of the blood and muscle tissue, the impact on intestine micropopulation of chickens, effect on microbial contamination of meat, the impact on processing performances of broiler chicken and meat properties, and impact on the sensory quality of the chicken meat. The experiment was conducted on Ross 308 broilers, divided into 6 groups (control and treatment groups depending on the different supplements of essential oils, zeolites, or combinations thereof). The fattening lasted 42 days and total of 288 both sex chicks were included (48 per in each group). Influence of the addition of essential oils and natural zeolite had a different impact on the observed individual values. Separately added XTRACTTM and Aroma Korm ® had a good effect on the observed properties of fattening, the technological properties of meat, chicken <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> antioxidant parameters of blood and meat, microbiological contamination and organoleptic properties. Zeolite, as a standalone supplement, had the lowest impact on the observed properties, but in combination with Aroma Korm ® or XTRACTTM, Zeolite improved their activity...|$|R
