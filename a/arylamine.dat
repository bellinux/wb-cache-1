N-Hydroxyarylamines can form adducts with DNA, tissue proteins, and the blood proteins albumin and hemoglobin in a dose-dependent manner. The determination of hemoglobin adducts is {{a useful tool for}} biomonitoring exposed populations. We have established the hemoglobin binding index (HBI) [(mmole compound/mole Hb) /(mmole compound/kg body weight) ] of several aromatic amines and nitroarenes in female Wistar rats. Incorporating values obtained by other researchers in the same rat strain, the logarithm of hemoglobin binding (log HBI) was plotted against several physicochemical parameters and against calculated electronic descriptors of nitroarenes and <b>arylamines.</b> Most <b>arylamines</b> and nitroarenes form hydrolyzable (e. g., sulfinamide) adducts with hemoglobin in rats. The amount of hemoglobin binding decreases with the oxidizability of the <b>arylamines,</b> except for compounds that are substituted with halogens in ortho or meta position. For halogen-substituted <b>arylamines,</b> the amount of hemoglobin binding is directly proportional to the pKa. Hemoglobin binding of nitroarenes increases with the reducibility of the nitro group. The structure activity relationships (SAR) for hemoglobin binding of nitroarenes and <b>arylamines</b> are comparable. The SAR found for hemoglobin binding were compared with the SAR found in the literature for mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and cytotoxicity of <b>arylamines</b> and nitroarenes. In general, the mutagenicity or carcinogenicity of <b>arylamines</b> increases with their oxidizability.

The dose-response relationship between the amount of tobacco smoked and level of 4 -aminobiphenyl-hemoglobin adducts in the slow acetylators (with an immediate steep increase of the adducts) was different from that in the fast acetylators (with a more regular increase).
