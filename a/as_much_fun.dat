5|$|In 2003, Wave Race 64 was {{released}} in China for the iQue Player console. A 1-hour demo of the game was also included with the console. On August 6, 2007, the game {{was released}} on the Wii's Virtual Console. Unlike the Nintendo 64 version, the Virtual Console release does not feature Kawasaki banners due to expired licensing deals. These were replaced by Wii and Nintendo DS advertisements. However, when the game was released on the Wii U's Virtual Console in 2016, the Kawasaki banners were restored. The Virtual Console versions of the game were generally very well received, with reviewers considering the game to be just <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> as {{it was on the}} Nintendo 64.|$|E
25|$|Englishman Lord Hesketh, in {{partnership}} with Anthony 'Bubbles' Horsley as driver, entered various Formula Three events around Europe in 1972, with the mission objective simply to have <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> as possible. Due partly Horsley's lack of experience, there were few results.|$|E
25|$|Following the Virginia Tech shootings, {{the game}} was banned {{outright}} at some colleges. Other college administrations banned Nerf blasters instead to discourage the game, but students were still allowed to use balled up socks or marshmallows, which students have admitted are not <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun.</b> Many campuses who responded negatively following the shootings have since repealed the Nerf bans, though others remain in place.|$|E
5000|$|Critical {{response}} to the album has been generally favorable. Billboard stated Jordin brought [...] "a first effort that's all over the map—and works" [...] while sounding [...] "like exactly what she should be singing at this age and juncture in her career." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+ saying her debut [...] "is <b>as</b> <b>much</b> effervescent <b>fun</b> <b>as</b> any post-Idol bow" [...] and added [...] "Idol has crowned winners with even bigger voices, but it hasn't given us one who's any easier on the ears." ...|$|R
50|$|Since 1993, Cycle Messenger Championships {{have taken}} place at national, {{continental}} and world levels. These events are held <b>as</b> <b>much</b> for <b>fun</b> and messenger networking as for competition. Bicycle messengers also take part in formal cycle competitions at all levels, and in all disciplines. Nelson Vails, silver medalist on the velodrome in the 1984 Olympics, worked as a bicycle messenger in New York City in the early 1980s. Ivonne Kraft, who competed in the 2004 Olympic cross country mountain bike race, is a multiple former Cycle Messenger World Champion, {{and worked as a}} bicycle messenger in Germany for a number of years.|$|R
6000|$|Several of {{the lower}} class of the parishioners now {{gathered}} round the strangers, and the cry arose among the boys that [...] "there was a-going to be a fite between mad Madge Murdockson and another Bess of Bedlam." [...] But while the fry assembled with the humane hope of seeing <b>as</b> <b>much</b> of the <b>fun</b> <b>as</b> possible, the laced cocked-hat of the beadle was discerned among the multitude, and all made way for that person of awful authority. His first address was to Madge.|$|R
25|$|Lead {{singer and}} guitarist Mikey Heppner had formed the punk rock group the Dropouts {{in the early}} 2000s merely {{as a way of}} having fun {{performing}} at shows, but after all his bandmates left for New York City to perform as the successful rock band the Stills full-time, he had an epiphany that he could take his own music more seriously, achieve that kind of success, and still have <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> as he hoped. This, coupled with his first exposure to Tricky Woo (which he enjoyed for their resemblance to Black Sabbath and Deep Purple), led him to re-establish the Dropouts with a different musical style - hard rock - and a more earnest pursuit of success.|$|E

500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Mary Brennan of Film {{thought that the}} movie was [...] "A {{lot of fun to}} watch, and easy to {{surrender}} to in the moment." [...] Houston Chronicle editor Louis B. Parks said [...] "The film is a marvel, a well-photographed feast of visual imagery", while Richard Schickel of Time wrote that it was [...] "Less frightening, but <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> as ever." [...] Washington Post contributor Desson Thomson felt it [...] "satisfactorily recycles the great surprises that made the first movie so powerful. And most significantly, it makes a big hoot of the whole business." ...|$|E
30|$|This study {{analyzed}} the structural {{relationships between the}} important constructs of school, home and family, and the happiness of Abu Dhabi school children. Survey {{data were collected from}} students in schools in the three regions of Abu Dhabi. The final dataset from 14, 837 students was analyzed. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and MANOVA were employed in the study. SEM examined the association between latent constructs. For SEM, goodness of fit indices for the hypothetical model were good, and all paths were significant. The model incorporating both indirect and direct impact of home-related variables, such <b>as</b> how <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> did one have with their family, how did the family members get along, and how much time parents spent with their children, on the happiness of Abu Dhabi school children is valid. MANOVA showed that for all constructs, significant differences existed with regard to student gender, grade level, school location, school type, and nationality.|$|R
6000|$|If a youth's chief idea of felicity is to [...] "have a good time;" [...] {{to enjoy}} {{himself to the}} utmost; to cram <b>as</b> <b>much</b> of sport, <b>fun,</b> and {{adventure}} into his early manhood as possible, with a happy-go-lucky indifference as to the future, he is not yet in a frame of mind to consider our question at all. I feel disposed to say to him--in paraphrase--"be serious, man, or, if ye can't be serious, be as serious as ye can," [...] while we consider a subject that is no trifling matter.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} {{reviewed}} by Variety, and described as [...] "a silly farce with few amusing moments {{and many more}} boring ones". The San Francisco Chronicle noted that [...] "the film goes {{as far as a}} non-pornographic film can go in depicting sexuality" [...] but [...] "Eventually you catch on that the film isn't really making fun of itself so <b>much</b> <b>as</b> making <b>fun</b> of the audience for watching." [...] However, Rotten Tomatoes gives Paris, France a %73 rating, meaning good reviews.|$|R
500|$|Among {{retrospective}} {{assessments of}} the song, Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, writing in their book on the former Beatles' solo careers, admire it as [...] "a hoedown stomper which was as country {{as any of the}} tracks on Beaucoups of Blues". Ian Inglis writes of [...] "Sunshine Life for Me": [...] "The result is a convincing piece of good-time folk-rock that would have been at home on Fairport Convention's groundbreaking album Liege & Lief, which was itself hugely influenced by the spirit of the Band's Music from Big Pink... he impression lingers that the track was <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> to make as it is to hear." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{appreciate}} {{other kinds}} of drummers who play differently, but it's not my style or what works for this band. I get [...] sometimes, and I go through periods where it really bothers me. But then I think about it, and I {{realize that this is}} what is really needed for this band. And I just try to have <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> with it as possible ... I just know the way [...] plays so well at this point that I always know kind of what he's going to do. I can always sense where he's going with things just by the mood he's in or the attitude or how the song is going. Once in a while, he throws me for a loop, but I can usually keep him where I want him." ...|$|E
500|$|Deusner {{gave the}} album {{a rating of}} 7 out of 10, complimenting the release by adding that, [...] "Madonna is an ideal {{candidate}} for the tribute album treatment, having already inspired several {{in the past but}} none [...] quite as sturdy or <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> as Through the Wilderness". However he felt that few of the songs were [...] "uninspired", like Drag's version of [...] "Oh Father" [...] and Bubonic Plague's rendition of Who's That Girl. Jon Caramanica from Spin also gave a positive review, saying that the album captures [...] "Madonna's vivacious side, but [...] desperate too". He particularly commended [...] "Crazy for You", saying that [...] "the last 30 seconds of [...] chilling—frontwoman Ariana Delawari and her traditional Afghan backing accelerate feverishly, breaking the sweat Madonna never quite did, or could".|$|E
5000|$|According to Stagegrade, {{the reviews}} were mixed, with some praising ("fun, {{beautiful}} musical") and some panning ("charm-free") the musical. The latter especially criticized {{the use of}} existing songs rather than having an original score. They conclude that this [...] "may {{be among the most}} polarizing shows of the current season." [...] Ben Brantley in his review for The New York Times, called the musical [...] "occasionally funny but mostly just loud." [...] Elysa Gardner, in her review for USA Today, commented that the musical has [...] "playful wit and exuberance" [...] and wrote that [...] "'Bullets' offers <b>as</b> <b>much</b> sheer, shameless <b>fun</b> <b>as</b> any show you'll see this season." ...|$|R
50|$|Cragged Mountain Farm is {{a summer}} camp in Freedom, New Hampshire, started by Dr. Henry Utter. It starts in July and ends in August. Campers stay in cabins, the ages range from 4 to 13. Over the years, {{hundreds}} of children and adults have found that a summer spent at Cragged Mountain Farm in the fresh mountain air, having fun with their friends, and exploring the mountains and rivers of northern New England is a priceless experience. Most good summer camps are special, but Cragged is an absolute “Old School” gem, providing {{as it has for}} more than 80 years the friendships and learning that can change lives, as well <b>as</b> so <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> and so many great activities that you’ll wonder why camp doesn’t go on year-round. CMF is a mixture of a healthy environment and good food along with the encouragement of play and discovery, compounded with music and mountain tops as well as the soothing waters of wild rivers and lakes, and that special feeling you get when you’ve been challenged and not only succeeded, but also took the time to help another person make it with a smile.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sketches}} {{are written}} by Forte, Sudeikis, and SNL writers John Lutz and John Solomon. At {{the end of}} the 2009-2010 season, Forte told The A.V. Club, [...] "I dislike the overuse of recurring characters <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the next person, but we just have so <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> doing that sketch. I know we've done it a lot this year, but God, we have fun. That's kind of what it's all about." ...|$|R
500|$|Perry's {{announcer}} on the broadcasts, Frank Gallop, {{became a}} foil for Como's jokes. When {{the television show}} began, {{there was not enough}} room for Gallop to appear on stage; he was an invisible [...] "voice from the clouds" [...] until the show's 1958 – 1959 season. There was <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> at rehearsals as on the show itself. Como's relaxed and fun-loving manner at rehearsals put many nervous guests at ease. It was common for Como to leave the Saturday afternoon rehearsal for about a half-hour to go to confession. He managed to save some time by asking his music publisher, Mickey Glass, to wait in line for him at the confessional. Glass, who was Jewish, was most agreeable to this, but wondered what to do if his turn came before Como arrived.|$|E
500|$|Cybermats {{are shown}} {{for the first}} time in the revived series. In the classic series, they {{appeared}} in The Tomb of the Cybermen (1967), The Wheel in Space (1968), and Revenge of the Cybermen (1975). The Doctor examines a toy and remarks, [...] "Robot dog; not <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> as I remember," [...] alluding to K-9, a robot dog who accompanied the Fourth Doctor. The Doctor claims to be able to [...] "speak 'baby'", as he did in [...] "A Good Man Goes to War". The Doctor expresses his dislike for Craig's [...] "redecorated" [...] house by using a line from the Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton) in The Three Doctors (1973) and The Five Doctors (1983). The Doctor recites the mini-poem [...] "Not a rat, a cybermat" [...] from the novelization of Revenge of the Cybermen.|$|E
500|$|The BBC {{described}} Whyte's {{music as}} [...] "a little difficult to handle" [...] {{but that the}} album [...] "shows {{just the right amount}} of restraint to prevent total disarray. Even if the album weren't half <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> as it is, that feat would be worthy of celebration in itself." [...] Exclaim! noted that [...] "songs like [...] "Hover Traps," [...] "Death Mountain" [...] and [...] "All Nite" [...] are, at their core, extremely primitive. But it's in the way that Rustie builds, deconstructs and sequences his songs that allows Glass Swords to work its way into your psyche" [...] and that [...] "after a couple of listens, one may come to the conclusion that Rustie might just be a one-trick-pony. But, man, that one trick is perfect." [...] Mojo referred to the album as [...] "easy to admire but hard to love".|$|E

500|$|The {{muffled sound}} of the album's {{production}} has attracted criticism; Stevie Chick disparaged the lack of character in Ginn's bass-playing on [...] "My War" [...] {{when compared to the}} 1982 demo of the same song with Dukowski on bass. [...] Michael Azerrad praised the strength of the material while denigrating the [...] "frustrating lack of ensemble feel" [...] as the album was recorded without a full lineup. [...] Critic Clay Jarvis commended the album, emphasizing the risks taken on it and its influence, calling it [...] "more a test than an album", and saying, [...] "independent music is stronger because Black Flag formulated it". [...] John Dougan at AllMusic called the A-side of the album [...] "quite good", but described the B-side as [...] "self-indulgence masquerading as inspiration and about <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> as wading through a tar pit". [...] Robert Christgau considered the B-side a [...] "waste".|$|E
500|$|Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times {{wrote that}} [...] "Mars Attacks! is all 1990s cynicism and disbelief, mocking the {{conventions}} that Independence Day takes seriously. This all sounds clever enough but in truth, Mars Attacks! is not <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> {{as it should}} be. Few of its numerous actors make a lasting impression and Burton's heart and soul {{is not in the}} humor". Desson Thomson from The Washington Post said [...] "Mars Attacks! evokes plenty of sci-fi classics, from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) to Dr. Strangelove (1964), but it doesn't do much beyond that superficial exercise. With the exception of Burton's jolting sight gags (I may never recover from the vision of Sarah Jessica Parker's head grafted on to the body of a chihuahua), the comedy is half-developed, pedestrian material. And the climactic battle between Earthlings and Martians is dull and overextended." ...|$|E
500|$|Of Miguel's {{performances}} in Los Angeles, The Orange County Register editor Daniel Chang commented that he [...] "delivered a classy show that was <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> {{to watch as}} it was to hear". Chang noted that Miguel [...] "emotes a contagious energy through dramatic facial expressions, fetal-position-like contortions and physical outbursts in time with the music" [...] and complimented his dance moves and the visual sets. [...] Regarding his concert in Houston, Michael D. Clark of the Houston Chronicle said that Miguel [...] "proved, once again, that it isn't necessary to change languages to reach U.S. audiences". He observed that Miguel seemed [...] "determined to balance the upbeat with the overwrought" [...] in contrast to his previous concerts which were dominated by ballads. On the other hand, Clark expressed disappointment that the boleros were sung in medleys which did not allow any of them to stand out.|$|E

500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalized}} rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 65, based on six reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews." [...] Margaret Wappler of Los Angeles Times rated the album three stars {{out of five}} and noted the Kelly Clarkson influences, writing that [...] "For {{the bulk of the}} album, Lovato channels a witty, pouty ingenue in high heels who's not afraid to call the shots, especially after a good cry." [...] Rating the album three and a half stars, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic noted the album's [...] "mature veneer" [...] and the [...] "subtle shift buried underneath the relentlessly cheerful Radio Disney production and Lovato's irrepressible spunk", writing that [...] "Both sonic characteristics tend to camouflage Demi's biggest moves away from teen pop." [...] Erlewine called the album [...] "Not quite <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> , but still fun". The Arizona Republic critic Ed Masley gave the album three and a half stars and recommended it for power pop fans.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Gary Cole's return was highly praised, {{as well as}} the scene in which Sarah imitates the face Chuck makes when the Intersect has a [...] "flash". HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall wrote, [...] "Cole's return was <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> as I hoped it would be - in some ways, even better than his first appearance in season two's 'Chuck vs. the Delorean,' where I liked Sarah and Jack's interaction but thought the actual con job was a bit thin. 'Chuck vs. the Wedding Planner' had its own flaw in the section where Sarah and Chuck are illegally using government resources to catch the con woman and wind up getting more government 'help' than they bargained for... But once Jack turned up in Burbank to help his daughter and her schnook of a fiance be heroes and get back in the good graces of General Beckman, 'Wedding Planner' was really very strong, both as a comedy piece (loved Yvonne Strahovski's accent as she impersonated Daphne) and another story about Sarah's colorful but ultimately sad past." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{her first}} appearance, Laura San Giacomo plays Harmony Chase, {{a woman who}} hires Keith to {{investigate}} her cheating husband. The two were both series regulars on the NBC sitcom Just Shoot Me!. The two actors had maintained a close friendship after their sitcom was cancelled, and when Rob Thomas brought up a romantic storyline for Keith to Colantoni, he suggested Giacomo for the role. Giacomo accepted the role, later stating, [...] "It {{was kind of a}} no-brainer situation for me. I love Rico, love working with him, and it was just <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> as I thought it would be." [...] In addition to sharing in-jokes about Just Shoot Me! while on set, Colantoni also remembered what a good actress he thought she was in their earlier days. After the first appearance, both Colantoni and Giacomo lobbied for more storylines together. Thomas was open to the possibility, saying, [...] "I wouldn't hesitate to go back to this, because I was really happy with how it played out." [...] Giacomo would go on to appear on three episodes of the show.|$|E
