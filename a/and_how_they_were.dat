5|$|The Trust {{had been}} {{reluctant}} to allow visitors to the house while work was underway, especially {{taking into account the}} costs of Health and Safety requirements and the delays these could cause to the essential preservation works. But the need for cash dictated the answer, and the Trust learnt that, through giving the public close access to the preservation works, they actually gave more additional donations as a result of seeing where their money was going <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> making a difference.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavations}} {{have revealed}} {{information about the}} original priory buildings and grounds, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> subsequently modified. A series of ditches was found that would have provided a supply of fresh water and also a means for drainage of a relatively wet site. Evidence of the earliest temporary timber buildings in which the canons were originally housed {{was found in the}} form of 12th-century post pits. Norton Priory is one of few monastic sites to have produced evidence of temporary quarters. The remains of at least seven temporary buildings have been discovered. It is considered that the largest of these, because it had more substantial foundations than the others, was probably the timber-framed church; another was most likely the gatehouse, and the other buildings provided accommodation for the canons and the senior secular craftsmen.|$|E

5|$|This theory {{stems from}} the various rumours {{spreading}} after Centaurs sinking. If Centaur had been in breach of the Hague Convention of 1907, and someone had informed the Japanese of this, I-177 may have been under valid orders to attack. When Centaur left Sydney, her decks were packed with green-uniformed men, and as Field Ambulance uniforms were only distinguishable from other Army uniforms by badge insignia and the colouration of the cloth band ringing the hat, a distant observer could {{have concluded that the}} hospital ship was transporting soldiers. Those witnessing the loading in Sydney would have seen the ambulance drivers bring their weapons aboard, and could have come to a similar conclusion. If a spy or informant had passed this information to the Japanese, I-177 could have been lying in wait. The main flaw in this theory is the question of how Nakagawa and his crew were able to predict that Centaur was taking an alternative route <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> able to determine the new route selected.|$|E

25|$|Related {{to stone}} {{recycling}} and stone reuse is the deconstruction and reconstruction {{of a stone}} building. The building is taken apart stone block by stone block and the location and orientation of each block is carefully noted. Any roofing slate and interior stone in place is catalogued and moved in the same fashion. After the blocks, slate, and other stone used have been transported to the new location, they are put back in place where <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> originally, thus reassembling the building. This is typically very expensive and rare but valuable in terms of historic preservation.|$|E
25|$|On March 4, 1861, Abraham Lincoln {{was inaugurated}} as president.

A crisis {{similar to the one}} at Fort Sumter had emerged at Pensacola, Florida, where Confederates threatened another U.S. fortificationFort Pickens. Lincoln and his new cabinet struggled with the decisions of whether to reinforce the forts, <b>and</b> <b>how.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> also concerned about whether to take actions that might start open hostilities and which side would be perceived as the aggressor as a result. Similar discussions and concerns were occurring in the Confederacy.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not known}} how the Jadhav {{came to be known}} by that name or when <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> brought under the generic term Kunbi.

The {{community}} is strictly endogamous; consanguinal marriages with maternal cousins are preferred over those with the paternal. However, the number of marriages of such nature are low. Marriages are arranged. The preferred minimum age is 22 for males and 18 for females, though these ages are increasing as of 2003. Cremation of the dead is the norm, burial being the exception for children and for those who have died of snake bites. Brahmins are employed for naming and marriage ceremonies.|$|E

25|$|The first volume's plot {{revolved}} around the main characters traveling to Neverland from Storybrooke to retrieve a kidnapped Henry Mills from the possession of Peter Pan. After successfully retrieving Henry, the characters returned to Storybrooke, only {{to be returned to}} their original worlds following Pan's new Curse, leaving Emma Swan and Henry to escape to New York City. The second plot followed the characters' past journey in the Enchanted Forest <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> brought back to Storybrooke by the Wicked Witch of the West, while also documenting Emma's mission to break the new Curse and save her family. New characters introduced in the season include the main antagonists of the two volumes: Peter Pan and the Wicked Witch of the West, in addition to Tinker Bell, Ariel, Prince Eric, Ursula, Medusa, Rapunzel, Lumiere, the Wizard of Oz, Glinda the Good Witch, the Good Witch of the North, the Witch of the East, Dorothy Gale, Blackbeard, Robin Hood and Elsa.|$|E
25|$|In January 1944 Whittle {{was awarded}} the CBE in the New Year Honours. By {{this time he was}} a Group Captain, having been {{promoted}} from Wing Commander in July 1943. Later that month after further negotiations the Ministry made another offer of Â£135,500 for Power Jets, which was reluctantly accepted after the Ministry refused arbitration on the matter. Since Whittle had already offered to surrender his shares he would receive nothing at all, while Williams and Tinling each received almost Â£46,800 for their stock, and investors of cash or services had a threefold return on their original investment. Whittle met with Cripps to object personally to the nationalisation efforts <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> being handled, but to no avail. The final terms were agreed on 28 March, and Power Jets officially became Power Jets (Research and Development) Ltd, with Roxbee Cox as Chairman, Constant of RAE Head of Engineering Division, and Whittle as Chief Technical Advisor. On 5 April 1944, the Ministry sent Whittle an award of only Â£10,000 for his shares.|$|E
25|$|Planometria, or, The Whole Art of Surveying of Land was a {{pamphlet}} written in 1650 by Leybourn and published under the pseudonym Oliver Wallinby. Leybourn expanded {{this into a}} full book, The Compleat Surveyor which {{was first published in}} 1653, by his own press. This was the first book published on the subject that did not contain an extensive argument justifying surveying. The book outlined the various instruments used in surveying, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> employed. This book was one of the standard references in the field {{for the remainder of the}} 17th century and into the 18th century. The book instructed property surveyors on the construction of property maps, and how to make the appropriate coloured inks for the maps. At this time, the use of private estates maps was starting to become fashionable, to the extent that some very pleased clients would display the coloured maps for their guests to view. The book also contains instructions on mathematical measures. The section on the use of Gunter's chains as a unit of length shows early use of decimals in surveying. Leybourn would later expand and clairify this in his 1657 work Arithmetick, Vulgar, Decimal and Instramental.|$|E
