5|$|Due to the {{increase}} in population after protective legislation was put into place, the Department of Conservation developed <b>a</b> <b>management</b> plan for the Kaimanawa herd in 1989 and 1990. A draft plan was made available to the public for comment in 1991, and the public made it clear that it objected to herd reduction through shooting from helicopters, and instead favored the horses remaining alive after being removed from the herd. However, core animal welfare groups felt that shooting was the most humane option. Trial musters were conducted in 1993, 1994 and 1995, and were successful, although costly and with a limited demand for the captured horses.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, the NPS {{began the}} process of {{developing}} <b>a</b> <b>management</b> plan for the Cumberland Island horse. After compiling information, they released a draft environmental assessment in early 1996 and began taking public comment on a potential management plan. Public opinion was severely divided, with environmentalists approving of the management plan, which would have likely resulted in the reduction or removal of the herd, and animal rights activists and island residents protesting the plan. However, before a plan could be implemented, US Representative Jack Kingston included a provision in a federal appropriations bill that prevented any management of the horses. Kingston made the change to the bill after touring the island, but without consultation with the NPS. He initially claimed that he personally did not see significant damage to the island from the horses, and that the herd size had decreased. However, upon later questioning, he refused to expand upon his observations of the damage to the island. The provision expired in 1997, but effectively halted momentum toward a park management plan. The study published in 2000 recommended <b>a</b> <b>management</b> strategy that reduced herd populations to environmentally-recommended sizes through a combination of off-island adoption to private owners and contraceptives. The researchers recommended that contraceptive use be focused on the female members of the herd, due to the high numbers of bachelor stallions.|$|E

5|$|In January 2010, Gill was {{appointed}} manager of Weymouth, then {{bottom of the}} Conference South. With the club already in financial difficulty, many first-team players left. Budgetary constraints meant Gill was unable to bring in replacements, and after 44 days in post, he resigned, feeling the job had become untenable. Weymouth's chairman claimed the cost of travelling from his Midlands home {{was a factor in}} his departure, a suggestion that Gill refuted. In mid-2010, he joined Bristol Rovers as youth team coach. He led the team to the third round of the FA Youth Cup, in which they lost narrowly to Aston Villa's youth team, before <b>a</b> <b>management</b> restructure at the club resulted in his departure.|$|E
5|$|It was Shea's {{responsibility}} {{to bring that}} engineering discipline to North American and to NASA's management of its contractors.

Presented with the notebook on Thursday evenings, Shea would study and annotate it over the weekend and return to work with new questions, instructions, and decisions. This idiosyncratic tool allowed him to keep tabs on a complex and ever-expanding program.|$|E
