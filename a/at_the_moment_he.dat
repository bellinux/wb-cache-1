5|$|In the Market Square {{stands the}} Gothic St. Mary's Basilica (Kościół Mariacki). It was rebuilt in the 14th-century and {{features}} the famous wooden altar (Altarpiece of Veit Stoss), the largest Gothic altarpiece in the world, carved by Veit Stoss. From the church's main tower a trumpet call (hejnał mariacki), is sounded every hour. The melody, {{which used to}} announce the opening and closing of city gates, ends unexpectedly in midstream. According to legend, the tune was played during the 13th-century Tatar invasion by a guard warning citizens against the attack. He was shot by an archer of the invading Tatar forces whilst playing, the bugle call breaking off <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> died. The story was recounted in a book published in the late-1920s called The Trumpeter of Krakow, by Eric P. Kelly, which won a Newbery Award.|$|E
25|$|This {{situation}} led him, in 1903, {{with his}} honor seriously damaged, to travel first to Argentina – {{where he started}} to write for different newspapers – and later to Paraguay, where he settled {{at the age of}} 29. In 1904 in October, he arrived to Villeta as a correspondent for the Argentine newspaper “El Tiempo” to report about the liberal revolution that was occurring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>he</b> immediately contacted the young intellectual that had adhered to the revolution. In Paraguay he formed a family and is where, according to his own words, he became “good”. Years later, he moved to Brazil {{as a result of a}} forced exile and then to Uruguay.|$|E
25|$|In 1984 Guild {{released}} {{the first official}} Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300guitars. In 1993 Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>he</b> uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer—the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998—as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May's original one has a sixpence).|$|E

25|$|Derksen {{continued}} the playing style {{he had developed}} in the past years. Notorious is Veendam's away match against Derksen's former club Cambuur in 1973. The second half had only just started when Derksen received a yellow card from referee G. Jonker from Voorburg. Derksen later made an extremely harsh foul by charging Cambuur's centre-back Sietse Visser in a , leaving the unfortunate Visser severely injured. Visser left the pitch on a stretcher. Despite this, referee Jonker did not send Derksen off. The furious crowd chanted en masse insults at Derksen, which he returned with a well-known obscene hand gesture <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> {{was about to leave}} the playing field. Out of fear for a lynching (Note:Dysphemism) the police closed the gates to ensure the visiting team would be granted a safe passage home. Sulking, but without demur the fans watched from behind the gate how the Veendam players laughed, scornfully, from behind the safe windows of their coach.|$|E
500|$|Mikel {{believed}} his sending off was [...] "harsh" [...] {{and placed the}} blame on the Arsenal players, who he felt overreacted. Lampard described his teammate Drogba as “…special, he's {{the best in the}} world <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>He</b> does it week in, week out and on the big occasions." [...] He argued the brawl near the end of the match highlighted how much the players from both sides wanted to win. Defender Ashley Cole, who left Arsenal in acrimonious terms to join Chelsea felt his decision to move was vindicated: [...] "I'm enjoying life, the manager's good and after six or seven months here I've already won a medal. That's why I came here." [...] Journalist Ian McGarry reported that Abramovich chose not to join the Chelsea players in congratulating them on their cup win, noting the fractured relationship between him and Mourinho.|$|E
500|$|Bates placed {{importance}} on mental images, {{as he felt}} relaxation {{was the key to}} clarity of imagination as well as of actual sight. He claimed that one's poise could be gauged by the visual memory of black; that the darker it appeared in the mind, and the smaller the area of black that could be imagined, the more relaxed one was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>He</b> recommended that patients think of the top letter from an eye chart and then visualize progressively smaller black letters, and eventually a period or comma. But he emphasized his view that the clear visual memory of black [...] "cannot be attained by any sort of effort", stating that [...] "the memory is not the cause of the relaxation, but must be preceded by it," [...] and cautioned against [...] "concentrating" [...] on black, as he regarded an attempt to [...] "think of one thing only" [...] as a strain.|$|E

500|$|Justin Timberlake {{performed}} [...] "Rock Your Body" [...] {{during his}} Justified World Tour and the Christina Aguilera conjoint tour Justified & Stripped Tour, both {{in support of}} his debut album Justified. Timberlake performed the song live on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live in October 2003, where he served as host and musical guest. On February 1, 2004, Timberlake performed the song with pop singer Janet Jackson during her performance at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> sang the lyric [...] "I'll have you naked {{by the end of this}} song," [...] the singer ripped off part of Jackson's outfit, momentarily exposing her right breast on live television. Timberlake distanced himself from the controversy while Jackson faced much criticism and backlash. He later commented that [...] "America's harsher on women... unfairly harsh on ethnic people." [...] Timberlake performed the song at the Hollywood Palladium, following his performance at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards on February 10, 2013. He performed [...] "Rock Your Body" [...] in a medley with other of his songs at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. In 2016, the singer performed the song along with [...] "Can't Stop the Feeling!" [...] during the interval act of the Eurovision Song Contest 2016 grand finale.|$|E
500|$|Among {{contemporary}} reviews, Time magazine declared [...] "Something" [...] to be {{the best}} track on Abbey Road, while John Mendelsohn wrote in Rolling Stone: [...] "George's vocal, containing less adenoids and more grainy Paul tunefulness than ever before, is one of many highlights on his 'Something,' some of the others being more excellent drum work, a dead catchy guitar line, perfectly subdued strings, and an unusually nice melody. Both his and Joe Cocker's version will suffice nicely until Ray Charles gets around to it." [...] Writing in Saturday Review magazine, Ellen Sander described [...] "Something" [...] as [...] "certainly {{one of the most beautiful}} songs George Harrison has ever written" [...] and added: [...] "He feels his way through the song, instinctively cutting through its body and into the core, emoting so clearly and so gracefully that <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> peals 'I don't know, I don't know,' it is shown that even what is not known can be understood." [...] In his review of the single, Derek Johnson of the NME lauded the track as [...] "a real quality hunk of pop" [...] with a [...] "strident lead guitar which exudes a mean and moody quality". Johnson stated his regret that Harrison [...] "isn't featured more regularly as a singer", and concluded of [...] "Something": [...] "It's a song that grows on you, and mark my words, it will – in a big way!" ...|$|E
500|$|Tracy was {{particularly}} respected for his naturalism on screen. Hume Cronyn, {{who worked with}} Tracy on The Seventh Cross, admired his co-star's screen presence: [...] "His method appeared to {{be as simple as}} it is difficult to achieve. He appeared to do nothing. He listened, he felt, he said the words without forcing anything." [...] Joan Crawford likewise expressed her admiration for Tracy's seemingly effortless performances. His four-time co-star Joan Bennett said, [...] "One never had the feeling he was 'acting' in a scene, {{but the truth of the}} situation was actually happening, spontaneously, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> spoke his lines." [...] James Cagney noted that Tracy was rarely the target of impressionists, because [...] "You can't mimic reserve and control very well" [...] and [...] "there's nothing to imitate except his genius and that can't be mimicked." [...] Specifically, Tracy was praised for his listening and reacting skills. Barry Nelson said that Tracy [...] "brought the art of reacting to a new height"; Stanley Kramer declared that Tracy [...] "thought and listened better than anyone in the history of motion pictures". Millard Kaufman noted that [...] " [...] listened with every fiber of his entire body". Burt Reynolds, in But Enough About Me, similarly noted Tracy's emphasis on naturalism when, as a rookie actor, he observed Tracy on the sets of Inherit the Wind. When Reynolds later introduced himself to Tracy as an actor, Tracy replied, [...] "An actor, huh? Just remember not to ever let anyone catch you at it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Guerrillero Heroico (English: [...] "Heroic Guerrilla Fighter") is {{an iconic}} {{photograph}} of Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara taken by Alberto Korda. It was captured on March 5, 1960, in Havana, Cuba, at {{a memorial service}} for victims of the La Coubre explosion. By the end of the 1960s, the image, in conjunction with Guevara's subsequent actions and eventual execution, helped solidify the charismatic and controversial leader as a cultural icon. Korda has said that <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> shot the picture, he was drawn to Guevara's facial expression, which showed [...] "absolute implacability" [...] as well as anger and pain. Years later, Korda would say that the photograph showed Che's firm and stoic character. Guevara was 31 {{years old at the time}} the photograph was taken.|$|E
2500|$|Willem Dafoe as [...] "He": Dafoe, who had {{previously}} worked with Lars von Trier in Manderlay from 2005, was cast after contacting Trier and asking what {{he was working on}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>He</b> received the script for Antichrist, although he was told that Trier's wife was skeptical about asking a renowned actor like Dafoe to do such an extreme role. Dafoe accepted the part, later explaining its appeal to him: [...] "I think the dark stuff, the unspoken stuff is more potent for an actor. It's the stuff we don't talk about, so if you have the opportunity to apply yourself to that stuff in a playful, creative way, yes I'm attracted to it." [...] The voice of the talking fox was also supplied by Dafoe, although the recording was heavily manipulated.|$|E
2500|$|On August 12, {{several hundred}} protesters {{gathered}} in Clayton, the county seat, seeking criminal {{prosecution of the}} officer involved in the shooting. Protesters in Ferguson carried signs and many held their {{hands in the air}} while shouting [...] "don't shoot," [...] apparently in response to rumors that Brown had his hands raised in an attempt to surrender <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> was shot. According to police, some protesters threw bottles at the officers, prompting the use of tear gas to disperse the crowd. The following day, a SWAT team of around 70 officers arrived at a protest demanding that protesters disperse. That night, police used smoke bombs, flash grenades, rubber bullets, and tear gas to disperse the crowd. Video footage of the events recorded by KARG Argus Radio shows Ferguson Police firing tear gas into a residential neighborhood and ordering the journalist to cease recording.|$|E

2500|$|Historian Diarmaid Ferriter said: [...] "There'll be broad {{consensus}} {{around what}} Bertie did in Northern Ireland, the social partnership and the unity {{he brought to}} his own party. Also, he made Fianna Fáil the permanent party of government. They used {{to have all of}} the power most of the time, but now they have most of the power all of the time. All of that takes skill. But I wonder will people talk about 'Ahernism'? Is there any such thing? What does he actually stand for? In some ways Bertie's lack of vision was a positive, it made him flexible and willing to compromise, and he was certainly outstanding in that regard. But I dissent from the universal plaudits going around <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>He</b> had no social or economic vision for the state he led. There was no fire in his belly. He didn't really want to change society for the better. He was the ward boss writ large. But at the moment it seems it's unfashionable to say anything adverse about Bertie." ...|$|E
