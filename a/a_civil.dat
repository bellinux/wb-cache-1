40|$|The {{relationship}} between humanitarian aid and peace prospects, {{and the differences}} between this {{in the case of}} <b>a</b> proxy <b>civil</b> war and <b>a</b> non-proxy <b>civil</b> war is that in <b>a</b> proxy <b>civil</b> war there is a greater need for a specific case approach because proxy civil wars are much more complicated. In <b>a</b> non-proxy <b>civil</b> war <b>a</b> peaceful situation has to been agreed on on the local level and humanitarian aid could contribute to peace prospects, in <b>a</b> proxy <b>civil</b> war humanitarian aid affects peace prospects to a lesser degree because of the multi-layered nature of this type of conflict where on all layers of the proxy civil war peace has to be agreed on. Moreover, aid providers, donors, and other (foreign) involved actors have more influence on <b>a</b> proxy <b>civil</b> war than in <b>a</b> non-proxy <b>civil</b> war and therefore humanitarian aid could adversely affect peace prospects...|$|R
