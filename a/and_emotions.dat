40|$|Self-disclosure <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> {{are common}} in our {{everyday}} lives, making it important to analyze how they manifest in our college classrooms. Communication studies scholars have yet to analyze how teachers and students constitutively make meaning of, and from, self-disclosure <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> within our classrooms. This research fills the gap by using the social constructionist perspective to study how teachers and students co-constitute self-disclosure <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> in the classroom. This study addresses three main concepts that reflect teachers 2 ̆ 7 narratives of self-disclosure and emotion: students and teachers as equal/unequal models, students and teachers as models of self-disclosure <b>and</b> <b>emotion,</b> <b>and</b> {{the ways in which}} self-disclosure <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> positively <b>and</b> negatively affect students 2 ̆ 7 classroom participation and learning experience. Further, it complicates each of these concepts by recognizing that our perceptions and stories are socially constructed, and we are always socially reconstructing meaning.

40|$|Sleep loss is {{experienced}} universally, and significantly impacts cognition <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> in adults. However, {{little to no}} research has investigated this relationship in the preschoolaged years. This is an essential time period in which executive function <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> regulation undergo extensive development. As sleep patterns also mature in children during this time, pronounced effects of sleep on developmental domains may be apparent. We experimentally manipulated sleep restriction in 4 - 6 year-old children, to test its effects on executive function <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> regulation, aspects of cognition <b>and</b> <b>emotion,</b> respectively. We conducted a 10 -day study, where executive function <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> regulation were assessed twice in children, following a strict sleep schedule for five days prior. Children received either a sufficient amount of sleep or a restricted amount of sleep (3 hour sleep loss) the night prior to assessments. Sleep restriction impaired children’s overall performance on tasks and affected physiological responses to affective stimuli, but {{did not seem to}} specifically affect executive function or emotion regulation. This study has implications for future work on the development of executive functions, <b>emotion</b> regulation, <b>and</b> on the potential mediational nature of executive function between sleep <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> regulation...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Problematic Internet Use (PIU), broadly {{conceptualized}} as {{an inability to}} control one’s use of the Internet leading to negative consequences in daily life, is fast becoming a matter of significant concern in our society, particularly in adolescents. In the present study we aimed to assess a model in which metacognitions <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> regulation independently predicted PIU. Method: A total of 380 adolescent students from a secondary school in Italy voluntarily participated in the study. Students completed a set of online self-report scales assessing PIU, metacognitions, <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> regulation. Results: Metacognitions, {{with the exception of}} cognitive self-consciousness, were positively correlated with PIU. Moreover, emotion regulation negatively correlated with PIU. The model tested indicated that both metacognitions <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> regulation had direct effects (positive and negative respectively) on PIU and that the relationship between metacognitions <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> regulation was not significant. Conclusions: Both metacognitions <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> regulation appear to be relevant to PIU among adolescents. We discuss the implications of these findings. ...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} on culture <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> questioned whether emotions are universal or culture-specific. However, {{as it has}} become clear that emotions have both universal and culture-specific features, recent research has focused on distinguishing the aspects of emotions that are more universal from those that are more culture-specific. We tested {{the extent to which the}} three emotion domains in the cascading model of emotional intelligence (emotion perception, <b>emotion</b> understanding, <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> regulation) are universal versus culture-specific. In the first study, data from China, the United States, Japan, India, and Argentina provided support for our hypotheses that emotion perception is the more universal domain of emotional intelligence, <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> understanding <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> regulation are more culture-specific domains. In the second study, the findings were replicated using a larger sample from China and the United States, and we explored specific cultural differences in <b>emotion</b> understanding <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> regulation.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{relations between}} the processing of facial identity <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> in own- <b>and</b> other-race faces, using a fully crossed design with participants from 3 different ethnicities.

There was evidence for coactive processing of identity <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> that was linked to super capacity for own-race but not for other-race faces. In addition, the size of the redundancy gain for other-race faces varied with the amount of social contact participants had with individuals from the other race. The data demonstrate qualitative differences in the processing of facial identity <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> cues in own and other races. The results also demonstrate that the level of integration of identity <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> cues in faces may be determined by life experience and exposure to individuals of different ethnicities...|$|R

5|$|Sonically, Impossible Princess is a {{departure}} from Minogue's previous music, having taken influence by the techno and Britpop revolution in the mid-to-late 1990s. Conceived as an experimental record, the material encompasses a variety of darker styles from the dance genre, including trip hop, electronica, rock, drum and bass and house. Additionally, selected recordings experiments with cultural elements like Middle Eastern music and Celtic origins. Lyrically, the album's central focus is about Minogue's self-discovery, which she found during a series of trips in Asia, America and Australasia, and further delves into the freedom of expression, relationships <b>and</b> <b>emotions.</b>|$|E

England is as remote from Keltic fire and agony, as the Thames is from the Spey. Bennett was a typical specimen of this English characteristic. He was a poet, but of the school of Wordsworth rather than of Byron and Shelley.|$|E

5|$|Care must {{be taken}} with medications, as side effects may be more common and harder to {{evaluate}} in individuals with AS, and tests of drugs' effectiveness against comorbid conditions routinely exclude individuals from the autism spectrum. Abnormalities in metabolism, cardiac conduction times, and {{an increased risk of}} type 2 diabetes have been raised as concerns with these medications, along with serious long-term neurological side effects. SSRIs can lead to manifestations of behavioral activation such as increased impulsivity, aggression, and sleep disturbance. Weight gain and fatigue are commonly reported side effects of risperidone, which may also lead to increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms such as restlessness and dystonia and increased serum prolactin levels. Sedation and weight gain are more common with olanzapine, which has also been linked with diabetes. Sedative side-effects in school-age children have ramifications for classroom learning. Individuals with AS may be unable to identify and communicate their internal moods <b>and</b> <b>emotions</b> or to tolerate side effects that for most people would not be problematic.|$|E
5|$|Docter {{recruited}} a story crew to {{help develop}} the film's plot line. Although animation as an industry had been dominated by men, half of the story crew were women, {{in an attempt to}} have more diverse input. The choice to focus the film on a girl came from research that claimed that females age 11 to 17 are more attuned to expressions <b>and</b> <b>emotions</b> than others. The idea to have Riley play hockey came from Del Carmen, who observed that the sport is very popular in Minnesota. They tried to stray away from stereotypically feminine interests, such as the color pink or dresses. Initial ideas for the film found the main character, Riley, falling into a deep depression: Docter later felt they were inappropriate and scrapped them, although in the final film Riley does sink into a depression.|$|E

Interpretive understanding was assessed by two tasks measuring children's understanding of ambiguous situations. Moral judgments <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> attributions were measured using two moral rule transgressions. Social behaviour was assessed using teachers' ratings of aggressive and prosocial behaviour. Aggressive behaviour was positively related to interpretive understanding and negatively related to moral reasoning. Prosocial behaviour was positively associated with attribution of fear. Moral judgments <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> attributions were related, depending on age. Interpretive understanding was unrelated to moral judgments <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> attributions.

When it was announced that Besant would undertake a speaking tour of Australia in 1908, she was expected to stay with Fuller while in Perth. Some months later in 1908, Fuller left Western Australia and travelled to India, staying at Adyar. Of her time in India, Fuller wrote:I went in search not only of beauty, and light, and colour, and the picturesqueness in general, which delight the eye <b>and</b> <b>emotions</b> of all artists—but of something deeper—something less easily expressed. I spent {{two and a half years}} in a community that is quite unique—perhaps the most cosmopolitan settlement in the world—the headquarters of the Theosophical Society...
