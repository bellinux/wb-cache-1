25|$|This {{period was}} not without tragedies. On a stormy night in 1912 a {{resident}} of Willow Bunch, H.B. Hodge, drowned in Willow Bunch Lake. Hodge, who was heavily intoxicated at the time, was taking <b>a</b> <b>ride</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Willow Bunch Lake Ferry and fell off and, due to the stormy weather, no one heard him calling for help {{until it was too}} late. On August 15, 1913, Willow Bunch and other villages in the southwest of Saskatchewan were hit by a large thunderstorm. This storm brought lightening, hail and very strong winds that caused $4,000 worth of damage to buildings, killed local livestock and destroyed crops. On August 5, 1922, the population of Willow Bunch was rocked by a mumps epidemic; there were no fatalities but many children became gravely ill.|$|E
25|$|The Freedom Ticket will {{initially}} {{be available}} for sale at the Atlantic Terminal, Nostrand Avenue, and East New York stations in Brooklyn and at the Laurelton, Locust Manor, Rosedale, and St. Albans stations in Queens. Riders, under the pilot, {{would be able to}} purchase one-way, weekly, or monthly passes that will be valid on the LIRR, on buses, and the subway. The fare will be higher than the price of <b>a</b> <b>ride</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> MetroCard, but it will be lower than the combined price of an LIRR ticket and a MetroCard, and it will allow unlimited free transfers between the LIRR, buses, and subway. The former head of the MTA, Thomas Prendergast, announced at the January 2017 board meeting that the plan would be explored in a field study to determine fares and the impact on existing service. The plan is intended to fill approximately 20,000 unused seats of existing trains to Atlantic Terminal and Penn Station (or about 50% to 60% of peak trains in each direction), {{while at the same time}} providing affordable service to people with long commutes. The details will be announced in spring 2017, and the pilot will last six months.|$|E

500|$|Construction was {{undertaken}} by Main Roads Department day labourers, starting in January 1935, {{as part of}} an unemployment relief works program. The Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) was involved in various aspects of the project – some railway land acquisition was required, and WAGR supplied and supervised a five-ton crane, used to erect the railway span girders. The bridge was completed less than one year after construction began, which would later be described as [...] "a considerable achievement of the management and workforce for such a complex structure". Clackline Bridge was opened on 30 August 1935 by Acting Minister for Works H. Millington, having cost £9000. The first vehicle to cross the bridge was Millington's car, carrying himself and Albert Hawke on the front bumper, and a small boy who decided to take <b>a</b> <b>ride</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rear bumper. Afterwards, there was an official lunchtime party in Northam, hosted by the Northam Roads Board.|$|E

500|$|The railway quickly saw an {{increase}} in traffic, with an average 11 percent annual increase from the opening until the mid-1950s. In part to allow access to Kjosfossen, Kjosfossen Station was opened in 1951. By then, ridership had stabilized at 115,000 people per year. A {{significant portion of the}} traffic consisted of tourists, in part from cruise ships docked in Flåm. In {{the latter half of the}} decade, NSB launched the Norway in a Nutshell package, which included <b>a</b> <b>ride</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Flåm Line. A sleeping car was introduced on the night train between Flåm and Oslo in 1958. It made three trips in each direction per week during the summer season, and achieved an 84 percent occupancy rate. The same year, Breikvam Station became unmanned. Traffic remained stable throughout the 1960s, while interest in developing the railway for tourists declined and local politicians stated that a road was needed to attract tourists to Aurland. The power station was upgraded to [...] in 1969.|$|E
500|$|With {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of the automobile and subsequent construction of new roads, ridership on the incline diminished and it was losing $25,000 a year by 1961. However, since the 1980s, the incline {{has become one of the}} main tourist attractions in Johnstown, with people visiting the incline to [...] "ride for fun, nostalgia and novelty."
