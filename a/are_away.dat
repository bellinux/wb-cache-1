5|$|In the mid-eighteenth century, Morgan's grandson, John Black, and his Mohawk friend Kanyenke are {{on their}} way through the Carolinas to Brunswick with their band of mercenaries after being called for by the colony's governor, John's uncle, Stuart Black. After {{defending}} the colony against Cherokee raiders, John and Kanyenke attack the Cherokee war camps, forcing the Cherokee to arrange a peace settlement. But while John, Kanyenke, and most of the colony's garrison <b>are</b> <b>away</b> at the negotiations both they and Brunswick are attacked by a British army under General Warwick, who capture the town. Warwick captures Stuart and begins questioning him about the location of the Lake of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|The American white ibis {{is found}} {{in a variety of}} habitats, {{although}} shallow coastal marshes, wetlands and mangrove swamps are preferred. It is also commonly found in muddy pools, on mudflats and even wet lawns. Populations that <b>are</b> <b>away</b> from the coast and shoreline, particularly in southern Florida, often reside in other forms of wetlands such as marshes, ponds and flooded fields. In summer, these move to more coastal and estuarine habitats as inland waterways become flooded with summer rains and the ibis find the water levels too deep to forage effectively.|$|E
5|$|Becca becomes hurt upon {{realising}} that Bradley and Stacey {{are getting}} married. While they <b>are</b> <b>away</b> {{at their own}} wedding, Becca steals a hairbrush with Archie's hair from The Queen Victoria, intending to have a DNA test done on Stacey's baby to prove if it is really Archie's. However, she has doubts and goes back with Stacey to return the brush, but is caught by Ronnie. Becca coerces Stacey to confess Archie raped her and the baby is his. However, Ronnie tells Stacey that Archie underwent an operation {{a few years back}} that left him infertile, meaning that Stacey's baby isn't his. Roxy accuses Ronnie of murdering Archie. Ronnie denies it, but tells her she found out about the rape, and that Archie once raped her. Peggy tells the two of them that when Archie was murdered, she found him lying on the floor, took her divorce papers from the bar and left him to die. Phil tells Peggy about his alibi, the shirt and that he found Archie dead on Christmas Day. Shirley then returns and says Phil has got away with it as she has not told the police anything. Meanwhile, Becca anonymously reports to the police that Bradley had a motive for the murder.|$|E

5|$|For otariids {{and some}} phocids like the harbor seal, mothers fast and nurse their pups {{for a few}} days at a time. In between nursing bouts, the females leave their young onshore to forage at sea. These {{foraging}} trips may last anywhere between a day and two weeks, depending on the abundance of food and the distance of foraging sites. While their mothers <b>are</b> <b>away,</b> the pups will fast. Lactation in otariids may last 6–11 months; in the Galápagos fur seal it can last as long as 3 years. Pups of these species are weaned at lower weights than their phocid counterparts. Walruses are unique in that mothers nurse their young at sea. The female rests at the surface with its head held up, and the young suckle upside down. Young pinnipeds typically learn to swim on their own and some species can even swim at birth. Other species may wait days or weeks before entering the water. Elephant seals do not swim until weeks after they are weaned.|$|E
5|$|Some time later, Pillai is released. He brings {{news that}} Jackson has been {{transferred}} back to England on Davison's recommendation. At Kattabomman's court, a British messenger sent by Colonel Ooshington, Tirunelveli's new collector, reports that Pillai {{and his men}} have looted their granaries and killed their men at Srivaikuntam. Pillai justifies his act, saying that he instructed his men {{to do it because}} of the famine conditions prevalent in their kingdom. Ashamed of Pillai's act, Kattabomman accuses him of injustice. Pillai apologises and offers himself as a prisoner to the British, but Kattabomman refuses to hand him over; instead he offers money to the British as compensation for the looted rice. Ooshington does not agree and, with Major Bannerman's and Ettappan's help, incites the neighbouring rulers to attack Kattabomman. Bannerman is placed in charge of the British troops. He and Ettappan plan to attack Panchalankurichi when the people <b>are</b> <b>away</b> attending a festival in Tiruchendur. Kattabomman's spy Sunderalingam, overhears this and informs him; he prepares for battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of bold skin markings {{does not in}} itself prove that an animal relies on camouflage, as that depends on its behaviour. For example, although giraffes have a high contrast pattern that could be disruptive coloration, the adults are extremely conspicuous when in the open. Some authors have argued that adult giraffes are cryptic, since when standing among trees and bushes they are hard to see at even a few metres' distance. However, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves, even from lions, rather than on camouflage. A different explanation is implied {{by the fact that}} young giraffes are far more vulnerable to predation than adults: {{more than half of all}} giraffe calves die within a year, and giraffe mothers hide their calves, which spend much of the time lying down in cover while their mothers <b>are</b> <b>away</b> feeding. Since the {{presence of}} a mother nearby does not affect survival, it is argued that young giraffes must be extremely well camouflaged; this is supported by the fact that coat markings are strongly inherited.|$|E

5|$|Procellariids {{begin to}} attend their nesting colony around one month prior to laying. Males will arrive first and attend the colony more {{frequently}} than females, partly {{in order to protect}} a site or burrow from potential competitors. Prior to laying there is a period known as the pre-laying exodus in which both the male and female <b>are</b> <b>away</b> from the colony, building up reserves in order to lay and undertake the first incubation stint respectively. This pre-laying exodus can vary in length from 9 days (as in the Cape petrel) to around 50 days in Atlantic petrels. All procellariids lay one egg per pair per breeding season, in common {{with the rest of the}} Procellariiformes. The egg is large compared to that of other birds, weighing 6–24% of the female's weight. Immediately after laying the female goes back to sea to feed while the male takes over incubation. Incubation duties are shared by both sexes in shifts that vary in length between species, individuals and even the stage of incubation. The longest recorded shift was 29 days by a Murphy's petrel from Henderson Island; the typical length of a gadfly petrel stint is between 13 and 19 days. Fulmarine petrels, shearwaters and prions tend to have shorter stints, averaging between 3 and 13 days. Incubation takes a long time, from 40 days for the smaller species (such as prions) to around 55 days for the larger species. The incubation period is longer if eggs are abandoned temporarily; procellariid eggs are resistant to chilling and can still hatch after being left unattended for a few days.|$|E

25|$|The USA PATRIOT Act {{increased}} the powers allotted to the FBI, especially in wiretapping and monitoring of Internet activity. One {{of the most}} controversial provisions of the act is the so-called sneak and peek provision, granting the FBI powers to search a house while the residents <b>are</b> <b>away,</b> and not requiring them to notify the residents for several weeks afterwards.

25|$|M. flavitarsis {{will often}} forage along a stream {{in search of}} plant fibers to {{construct}} their nest, arthropods and nectar for feeding, and water for cooling the nest. Time spent away from the nest during foraging varies depending on what the wasp is looking for. When looking for pulp, a wasp will spend about 5 minutes away from the nest. A wasp searches for arthropods and nectar for about 15 minutes.

25|$|Imperial Valley can loosely {{categorize}} its {{cities and}} communities into three regions: the Salton Beach Towns, Desert Cities, and the El Centro area (urbanized Imperial).

The cities and communities of the desert region are outliers in that they <b>are</b> <b>away</b> from urbanized Imperial and tend to be smaller in population than the cities surrounding El Centro. Cities of the El Centro area tend to be larger than those of the desert and Salton regions.|$|E
25|$|Helping {{to remove}} {{obstacles}} to voting {{is an important}} part of Elections Canada’s work. Voters who are not able to vote on polling day can vote at the advance polls. A mail-in special ballot is available for Canadians who <b>are</b> <b>away</b> from their ridings, traveling or temporarily resident overseas. Even Canadians in their own ridings during the election period may use the special ballot if they do not wish to go to a Polling Station. In special cases, electors with a disability may vote at home, in the presence of an election officer. Mobile polls serve voters living in certain institutions, such as nursing homes for people who are elderly or who have a disability.|$|E
25|$|Ease {{of voting}} {{is a factor}} in rates of turnout. In the United States and most Latin American nations, voters must go through {{separate}} voter registration procedures before they are allowed to vote. This two-step process quite clearly decreases turnout. U.S. states with no, or easier, registration requirements have larger turnouts. Other methods of improving turnout include making voting easier through more available absentee polling and improved access to polls, such as increasing the number of possible voting locations, lowering the average time voters have to spend waiting in line, or requiring companies to give workers some time off on voting day. In some areas, generally those where some polling centres are relatively inaccessible, such as India, elections often take several days. Some countries have considered Internet voting as a possible solution. In other countries, like France, voting is held on the weekend, when most voters <b>are</b> <b>away</b> from work. Therefore, the need for time off from work as a factor in voter turnout is greatly reduced.|$|E
