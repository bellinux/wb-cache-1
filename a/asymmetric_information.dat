25|$|The basic {{supply and}} demand theory predicts that raising the minimum wage helps workers whose wages are raised, and hurts {{people who are not}} hired (or lose their jobs) when {{companies}} cut back on employment. But proponents of the minimum wage hold that the situation is much more complicated than the basic theory can account for. One complicating factor is possible monopsony in the labor market, whereby the individual employer has some market power in determining wages paid. Thus it is at least theoretically possible that the minimum wage may boost employment when affected employees spend more in other sectors of the economy. Though single employer market power is unlikely to exist in most labor markets {{in the sense of the}} traditional 'company town,' <b>asymmetric</b> <b>information,</b> imperfect mobility, and the personal element of the labor transaction give some degree of wage-setting power to most firms.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{the advent}} of models of {{imperfect}} and <b>asymmetric</b> <b>information,</b> the traditional neoclassical economics literature had assumed that markets are efficient except for some limited and well defined market failures. More recent work by Stiglitz and others reversed that presumption, to assert {{that it is only}} under exceptional circumstances that markets are efficient. Stiglitz has shown (together with Bruce Greenwald) that [...] "whenever markets are incomplete and/or information is imperfect (which are true in virtually all economies), even competitive market allocation is not constrained Pareto efficient". In other words, they addressed [...] "the problem of determining when tax interventions are Pareto-improving. [...] The approach indicates that such tax interventions almost always exist and that equilibria in situations of imperfect information are rarely constrained Pareto optima." [...] Although these conclusions and the pervasiveness of market failures do not necessarily warrant the state intervening broadly in the economy, it makes clear that the [...] "optimal" [...] range of government recommendable interventions is definitely much larger than the traditional [...] "market failure" [...] school recognizes.

30|$|According to the authors, two links {{are said}} to be coordinated interfering links if the {{transmitters}} of links are within carrier sensing range of each other. These coordinated transmitters prevent each other from concurrent transmissions, resulting in negligible packet collisions. On the other hand, if transmitters of the two interfering links are not within carrier sensing range of each other, three additional categories of interference - near hidden, far hidden, and <b>information</b> <b>asymmetric</b> - are possible. We collectively refer to the interference caused by these categories as non-coordinated (non-CO) interference. In case of non-coordinated interfering links, the two transmitters cannot sense the transmissions of each other. This results in increased probability of collisions. Particularly, among non-coordinated interference, <b>information</b> <b>asymmetric</b> interference is the most detrimental in terms of unfair channel sharing and end-to-end throughput performance [32]. The asymmetry of the channel view of the two <b>information</b> <b>asymmetric</b> interfering links allows one link to achieve its maximum throughput while the other link starves. Consequently, bottleneck links are introduced in the network, leading to reduced end-to-end throughput. Therefore, an efficient routing scheme is required, which considers coordinated as well as asymmetric non-coordinated interactions of transmitters and receivers during path construction procedure to avoid such bottleneck links.|$|R
