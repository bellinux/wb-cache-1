5000|$|The {{contract}} for the meat was arranged hurriedly and at the lowest-possible price by Secretary of War Russell A. Alger from the Chicago [...] "big three" [...] meatpacking corporations, Morris & Co, Swift & Co, and Armour & Co. In the atmosphere of pre-regulation-era Chicago, the companies took advantage of Alger's inattention and favorable attitude to the industry (as well as the Army's immediate need for large amounts of cheap beef to provision the expeditionary forces) by further cutting corners and reducing quality on the (already heavily <b>adulterated)</b> <b>product</b> they shipped for the US contract.|$|E
5000|$|Apiole (always {{with the}} final 'e') is the correct {{spelling}} of the trivial name for 1-allyl-2,5-dimethoxy-3,4-methylenedioxybenzene. Apiol, also known as 'liquid apiol' or 'green oil of parsley' is the extracted oleoresin of parsley, rather than the distilled oil. Its use was widespread in the USA, often as ergoapiol or apergol, until a highly toxic <b>adulterated</b> <b>product</b> containing apiol and tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (also famous as the adulterant added to Jamaican ginger) was introduced on the American market. 1'-sulfoxy metabolite formation for apiole (3,4-OMe-safrole) is about 1/3 as active as safrole.

50|$|If a food is adulterated, FDA and FSIS have a {{broad array}} of {{enforcement}} tools.They are of various types. These include seizing and condemning the product, detaining imported product, enjoining persons from manufacturing or distributing the product, or requesting a recall of the product. Enforcement action is usually preceded by a Warning Letter from FDA to the manufacturer or distributor of the <b>adulterated</b> <b>product.</b> In the case of an adulterated meat or poultry product, FSIS has certain additional powers. FSIS may suspend or withdraw federal inspection of an official establishment. Without federal inspection, an establishment may not produce or process meat or poultry products, and therefore must cease operations. With the exception of infant formula, neither FDA nor FSIS has the authority to require a company to recall an adulterated food product. However, the ability to generate negative publicity gives them considerable powers of persuasion.|$|E

5000|$|Many tansy species {{contain a}} {{volatile}} oil {{which can cause}} contact dermatitis in sensitive individuals. If taken internally, toxic metabolites are produced as the oil is broken down in the liver and digestive tract. It is highly toxic to internal parasites, and for centuries tansy tea has been prescribed by herbalists to expel worms. Tansy is an effective insecticide and is highly toxic to arthropods. Because it contains thujone, the U.S. FDA limits the use of tansy to alcoholic beverages, and the final product must be thujone-free. [...] Tanacetum annuum is often confused with common tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) but the former produces an essential oil that is completely different chemically as it contains no thujone and high amounts of chamazulene making the oil dark blue in color, giving rise to it common name of Blue Tansy Oil. [...] Despite claims by some unethical resellers of essential oils who adulterate the very expensive Blue Tansy (Tanacetum annuum) oil with the much cheaper oil from Tanacetum vulgare, {{it should be noted}} that the oil from Tanacetum vulgare is never blue in color as it contains no chamazulene. For this reason a high thujone oil from Tanacetum vulgare should never be referred to as [...] "Blue Tansy" [...] oil and any such blue oil containing significant thujone is an <b>adulterated</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E

Anjali (Kajal Aggarwal) joins their company as a translator. Both Vimalan and Akhilan are smitten by her. She, along with her Russian friend Volga, a journalist, spend their time with the brothers. Meanwhile, Anjali falls for Vimalan and Akhilan is jealous, yet feels happy for them. Volga is then revealed to be a spy who seemingly tries to steal the trade secrets of Energion. She is exposed and sent out by Ramachandran. She then takes the brothers to their cattle farm under the pretext of an interview where she takes pictures and even collects a milk sample from their farm. When Vimalan questions her, she warns him that Energion is an <b>adulterated</b> <b>product</b> {{and can lead to}} the death of thousands of children. She also exposes their father of killing the head of their R & D department and setting the lab on fire, thereby destroying evidence. Consequently, she is murdered, but, she swallows a pen-drive containing evidences of the foul-play before dying. Anjali acquires it from the person who performs Volga’s autopsy. She hands the pen-drive over to Vimalan. Following this, Vimalan and Akhilan are confronted by goons who try to get the pen-drive from him.

40|$|Aloe vera {{beverages}} have to {{be produced}} exclusively using material of the plant species Aloe barbadensis MILLER. Commercial material {{was reported to be}} frequently adulterated by artificial preservatives or to lack significant amounts of Aloe ingredients. HPTLC and HS-SPME/GC/MS methods to assess the authenticity of Aloe vera beverages were developed in this study, allowing to differentiate between authentic and <b>adulterated</b> <b>products.</b> In one case a commercially available Aloe vera juice could be proven to be exceedingly watered down. Parallel to the authenticity control, the HS-SPME method employed in this work allowed to detect the preservatives benzoic acid, sorbic acid and pHB-esters. In 17 of 24 (71 %) currently available Aloe-food products an illegal addition of preservatives of up to 1000 mg/l could be ascertained. The presented analyses of Aloe vera beverages lead to the conclusion, that this product line does not give any cause for hygienic but rather legal concerns: controls {{have to be}} intensified to ensure sufficient product quality with regard to preservatives...|$|R

40|$|Combinatorial peptide ligand {{libraries}} (CPLLs) {{have been}} adopted to investigate the proteome of artichoke exts., of a home-made alc. infusion and of the Italian Cynar liqueur. The aim of study was not only to perform the deepest investigation so far of the artichoke proteome but also to assess the genuineness of the com. aperitif via a three-pronged attack. First, different extn. techniques {{have been used for}} the characterization of the artichoke's proteome, secondly a home-made infusion has been analyzed and finally the proteome of the com. drink was checked.

50|$|The Federal Insecticide Act (FIA) of 1910 was {{the first}} {{pesticide}} legislation enacted. This legislation ensured quality pesticides by protecting farmers and consumers from fraudulent and/or <b>adulterated</b> <b>products</b> by manufacturers and distributors. During World War II there was a marked increase in the pesticide market, as wartime research and development produced many chemicals with newly discovered insecticidal properties. Widespread usage of pesticides garnered much public and political support due to the resulting post war food surplus made possible by higher crop yield from significantly lower pest damage. Synthetic organic insecticide usage increased from 100 million pounds in 1945 to over 300 million pounds by 1950. The Federal Insecticide Act of 1910 set standards for chemical quality and provided consumers protection but {{did not address the}} growing issue of potential environmental damage and biological health risks associated with such widespread use of insecticides. Congress passed the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act in 1947 to address some of the shortcomings of the Federal Insecticide Act.|$|R
50|$|Between the 1880s and World War I, the {{consumption}} of bottled lithia mineral water was popular. The most premium of all the mineral water brands were lithia waters because of their acclaimed health benefits. One of the first commercially sold lithia waters in the United States was bottled at Lithia Springs, Georgia in 1888. During this era {{there was such a}} demand for lithia water that there was a proliferation of bottled lithia water products, however only a few were natural lithia spring waters. Most of the bottled lithia water brands added lithium bicarbonate to spring water and called it lithia water. With the advent of World War I and the formation of the new US government food safety agency, mineral water bottlers were under scrutiny. The new agency posted large fines against mineral water bottlers for mislabeled, misrepresented, and <b>adulterated</b> <b>products.</b> These government actions and their publicity along with public works that made clean tap water readily accessible caused the American public to lose confidence and interest in bottled mineral water.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Fake, counterfeit, or <b>adulterated</b> <b>products</b> {{have become}} a {{dangerous}} reality to consumers in developing countries. High value-added products are of particular concern, with pharmaceuticals topping the list, followed by packaged food. The prevalence of mobile phones, even in the poorest communities, {{and the availability of}} text-messaging, suggest that they may be used to solve this problem. This paper shows how an innovative system allows any member of the populace in the developing world to authenticate a drug before use by a simple text message over mobile phone. This system has been used to authenticate pharmaceuticals in a prototype demonstration project in Ghana. The prevalence of fake drugs and the willingness of customers to use this system were verified in a study involving a consumer base of eight pharmacies in Accra, Ghana, with almost 1000 responses over a three-month period. The opportunities and challenges to implementing such a system on an international basis will be described. Finally, the proposed technology will be compared with other options, showing why mobile phones may offer the most viable option for solving this vexing problem. T I...|$|R
40|$|In Italy, the {{production}} of wines with a Controlled Denomination of Origin (DOC) and Controlled and Guaranteed Origin (DOCG) has increased over the past 20 years of 91. 4 %, rising from 14. 3 % of the total wine produced in 1989, to the current 32. 7 %. To these production must be added the wines with Typical Geographic Indication (IGT), which currently account for about 27. 3 %, and that, therefore, lead wines qualified {{in reference to the}} origin to weigh about 60 % on national wine production. Authenticity of foods and, in particular, of wine has been extensively investigated because wine is an easily <b>adulterated</b> <b>product.</b> The production of DOC wines is particularly affected by this phenomenon. The appreciated antioxidant capacity of red wine is mainly due to the presence of polyphenols that have also influence on colour, taste of fullness, body, bitterness and astringency. Wines are known also to contain many biogenic amines. Their amounts and compositions depend on the type of grapes and their degree of ripeness and the climate and soil of the viticultural area, as well as vinification techniques. For these peculiar characteristics the potential of phenolic compounds and biogenic amines analysis for the differentiation of wines by grape variety, age or geographical origin has been recently recognized. Object of this study were samples of Italian red wines of five DOC wine varieties, chosen to be representative of the whole Italian wine production. Eleven biogenic amines (tryptamine, methylamine, ethylamine, agmatine, phenylethylamine, putrescine, cadaverine, histamine, tyramine, spermidine, and spermine) were determined by RP-HPLC with fluorimetric detection, after derivatization with dansyl chloride. The chromatographic data were then combined with spectrophotometric determinations of antioxidant capacity and total polyphenols. The subsequent data matrix structure was explored by Multivariate analysis techniques. The compounds analyzed demonstrated to be good descriptors to differentiate among the different wine varieties...|$|E

40|$|Accurate taxonomic {{identification}} of plant materials in herbal medicines {{is important for}} product quality control. The genus Paeonia (Saxifragales) {{is the source of}} the herbal preparations Paeoniae Radix (Paeoniae Radix Alba and Paeoniae Radix Rubra) and Moutan Radicis Cotex. However, confusion has arisen regarding their contents due to linguistic and taxonomic ambiguities, similar morphologies and different definitions of Paeoniae Radix in the Korean and Chinese national pharmacopoeias, leading to the distribution of <b>adulterated</b> <b>products.</b> To develop a method for identifying the four Paeonia species used in these medicines, three fluorescently-labeled peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes were designed against ITS 2 sequences containing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and used in a real-time PCR melting curve assay. Each of the four Paeonia species was accurately identified using this analysis. The accuracy and analytical stability of the PNA melting curve assay was confirmed using commercially available samples of the four Paeonia species. This assay is a reliable genetic tool to distinguish between different Paeonia-derived herbal medicines and identify the botanical origins of Paeoniae Radix and Moutan Radicis Cortex. This technique may also contribute to quality control and standardization of herbal medicines by providing a reliable authentication tool and preventing the distribution of inauthentic adulterants...|$|R
