5|$|Although fishers are {{competent}} tree climbers, {{they spend}} most of their time on the forest floor and prefer continuous forest to other habitats. Fishers have been found in extensive conifer forests typical of the boreal forest but are also common in mixed hardwood and conifer forests. Fishers prefer <b>areas</b> <b>with</b> continuous overhead cover with greater than 80% coverage and will avoid <b>areas</b> <b>with</b> less than 50% coverage. Fishers are more likely to be found in old-growth forests. Since female fishers require moderately large trees for denning, forests that have been heavily logged and have extensive second growth appears to be unsuitable for their needs.|$|E

5|$|Collected and {{described}} by Robert Brown {{in the early}} 19th century, Banksia speciosa is classified in the series Banksia within the genus. Its closest relative is B. baxteri. Banksia speciosa plants are killed by bushfire, and regenerate from seed. The flowers attract nectar- and insect-feeding birds, particularly honeyeaters, {{and a variety of}} insects. In cultivation, Banksia speciosa grows well in a sunny location on well-drained soil in <b>areas</b> <b>with</b> dry summers. It cannot be grown in <b>areas</b> <b>with</b> humid summers, though it has been grafted onto Banksia serrata or B.integrifolia.|$|E

5|$|The wet, or rainy, {{season is}} the time of year, {{covering}} one or more months, when most of the average annual rainfall in a region falls. The term green season is also sometimes used as a euphemism by tourist authorities. <b>Areas</b> <b>with</b> wet seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics. Savanna climates and <b>areas</b> <b>with</b> monsoon regimes have wet summers and dry winters. Tropical rainforests technically do not have dry or wet seasons, since their rainfall is equally distributed through the year. Some <b>areas</b> <b>with</b> pronounced rainy seasons will see a break in rainfall mid-season when the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon trough move poleward of their location {{during the middle of the}} warm season. When the wet season occurs during the warm season, or summer, rain falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. The wet season is a time when air quality improves, freshwater quality improves, and vegetation grows significantly.|$|E

50|$|Crime in {{metropolitan}} statistical areas {{tends to be}} above the national average; however, wide variance exists among and with{{in metropolitan}} areas. Some responding jurisdictions report very low crime rates, while others have considerably higher rates; these variations are due to many factors beyond population.

For 2011, the metropolitan statistical <b>area</b> <b>with</b> the highest violent crime rate was the Memphis metropolitan <b>area,</b> <b>with</b> a rate of 980.4 per 100,000 residents, while the metropolitan statistical <b>area</b> <b>with</b> the lowest violent crime rate was Logan metropolitan <b>area,</b> <b>with</b> a rate of 47.7.|$|R
