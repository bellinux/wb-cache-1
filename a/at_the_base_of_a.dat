5|$|Three Studies for Figures <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Crucifixion is a 1944 {{triptych}} {{painted by}} the Irish-born British artist Francis Bacon. The canvasses {{are based on}} the Eumenides—or Furies—of Aeschylus's Oresteia, and depict three writhing anthropomorphic creatures set against a flat burnt orange background. It was executed in oil paint and pastel on Sundeala fibre board and completed within two weeks.|$|E

5|$|The {{panels of}} Three Studies for Figures <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Crucifixion are painted on light Sundeala boards, a {{material}} Bacon was using {{at the time}} as an inexpensive alternative to canvas. Each bears a single taut sculptural form pitched against a harsh orange background. The orange hue displays inconsistently across the canvasses, {{due in part to the}} low level of oil in the paint, which resulted in varying rates of absorption into the board. The pallid flesh tones of the figures were achieved by overlaying grey and white brushstrokes, while the figures' props were coloured using a variety of yellow, green, white, and purple tones.|$|E
5|$|These ants live in nests {{in sandy}} soil which {{sometimes}} have a mound, which resembles a molehill. M. nigrocincta ants labor to conceal their nests using twigs and leaves. Depending {{on the type}} of habitat in which the colony is located, they decorate the nest with plant material and gravel. Other materials that are used to camouflage M. nigrocincta colonies include dry leaves, rocks, vegetation, and twigs. Nests are beside a clump of grass or bush or <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tree.|$|E
5|$|From the Greek {{word for}} pan pipes, σύριγξ, {{it is the}} vocal organ of birds. Located <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bird's trachea, it {{produces}} sounds without the vocal folds of mammals. The sound is produced by vibrations of {{some or all of}} the membrana tympaniformis (the walls of the syrinx) and the pessulus, caused by air flowing through the syrinx. This sets up a self-oscillating system that modulates the airflow creating the sound. The muscles modulate the sound shape by changing the tension of the membranes and the bronchial openings. The syrinx enables some species of birds (such as parrots, crows, and mynas) to mimic human speech. Unlike the larynx of mammals, the syrinx is located where the trachea forks into the lungs. Thus, lateralization of bird song is possible and some songbirds can produce more than one sound at a time.|$|E

5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{from the}} typhoon breached a flood-retaining wall at Camp Fuji, a training facility for the United States Marine Corps near Yokosuka. Marines inside the camp weathered the storm inside huts situated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hill which housed a fuel farm. The breach led to hoses being dislodged from two rubber storage bladders, releasing {{large quantities of}} fuel. The fuel flowed {{down the hill and}} was ignited by a heater used to warm one of the huts. The resultant fire killed 13 Marines, injured 68, and caused moderate damage to the facility. The facility's barracks were destroyed, along with fifteen huts and several other structures. The barracks were rebuilt, and a memorial was established for those who lost their lives in the fire.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the adult}} Guianan cock-of-the-rock {{consists}} mainly of fruits meaning they are frugivorous. Up to 65 species of fruit {{have been reported in}} their diet, primarily from canopy trees or lianas. Three quarters (75%) of the fruit eaten by the Guianan cock-of-the-rock at one study site were either black- or red-coloured fruit. In the British Guiana, Thomas E. Gilliard found papayas growing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> huge rock. On top of the rock were perched females that were nesting. He found that no other papayas were growing {{in that part of the}} forest and speculated that the perched females ate papayas in the forest where they are native and dropped the seeds below where they were nesting.|$|E
5|$|Three Studies for Figures <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Crucifixion {{is a key}} {{precursor}} to Bacon's later work, and he sustained its formal and thematic preoccupations throughout his career. The triptych format, the placement of figures behind glass in heavily gilded frames, the open mouth, the use of painterly distortion, the Furies, and {{the theme of the}} Crucifixion were all to reappear in later works. Bacon's principal mode of expression is introduced: the subjects are anatomically and physically distorted, and the mood is violent, foreboding, and relentlessly physical. In other respects the triptych stands apart from other paintings in his oeuvre. It refers directly to its inspirations, and interprets the source material in an uncharacteristically literal manner. The triptych is further distinct in that its creatures are located in an outside space; by 1948, Bacon's studies of heads and figures specifically emphasised their confinement in rooms or other closed spaces.|$|E

5|$|Hallival and Askival {{are formed}} from an {{extraordinary}} series of layered igneous rocks created as olivine and feldspar crystals accumulated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> magma chamber. The chamber eventually collapsed, forming a caldera. There are swarms of near-vertical dykes of basalt {{on the northwest}} coast between Kilmory and Guirdil, created by basaltic magma forcing its way into fissures in the pre-existing rock. The western hills, although less elevated than the Cuillin, exhibit a superb collection of periglacial landforms including boulder sheets and lobes, turf-banked terraces, ploughing boulders and patterned ground. On Orval and Ard Nev the weathered basalt and granophyre has been sorted by frost heaving into circles 50centimetres in diameter and weathering on Barkeval has produced unusual rock sculptures. On Sròn an t-Saighdeir there are large sorted granite boulder circles 2–3metres across on the flat summit and sorted stripes on the slopes. Lava flowing away from the volcanic centre formed Bloodstone Hill, gas bubbles leaving holes in the structure that were then filled with green agate flecked with red. There are some outcrops of the pre-volcanic Lewisian gneiss near Dibidil in {{the southeast corner of}} the island, and more extensive deposits of sandstone in the north and east.|$|E
5|$|The 2002 study {{indicated}} that the ancestors of the Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo diverged around the Paleogene-Neogene boundary. The Mascarene Islands (Mauritius, Réunion, and Rodrigues), are of volcanic origin and are less than 10 million years old. Therefore, the ancestors of both birds probably remained capable of flight for a considerable time after the separation of their lineage. The Nicobar and spotted green pigeon were placed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lineage leading to the Raphinae, which indicates the flightless raphines had ancestors that were able to fly, were semi-terrestrial, and inhabited islands. This in turn supports {{the hypothesis that the}} ancestors of those birds reached the Mascarene islands by island hopping from South Asia. The lack of mammalian herbivores competing for resources on these islands allowed the solitaire and the dodo to attain very large sizes. The dodo lost the ability to fly owing to the lack of mammalian predators on Mauritius. Another large, flightless pigeon, the Viti Levu giant pigeon (Natunaornis gigoura), was described in 2001 from subfossil material from Fiji. It was only slightly smaller than the Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo, and it too is thought to have been related to the crowned pigeons.|$|E
