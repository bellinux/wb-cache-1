The two main subclasses of Anthozoa are the Hexacorallia, members of which have six-fold symmetry and includes the stony corals, sea anemones, tube anemones and zoanthids; and the Octocorallia, which have eight-fold symmetry and includes the soft corals and gorgonians (sea pens, sea fans <b>and</b> <b>sea</b> whips), <b>and</b> <b>sea</b> pansies. The smaller subclass, Ceriantharia, consists of the tube-dwelling anemones.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe wave–seabed {{interaction}} {{issue is}} of great importance {{for the design of}} foundation around marine infrastructures. Most previous investigations for such a problem have been limited to uncoupled or one-way coupled methods connecting two separated wave <b>and</b> <b>seabed</b> sub models with the continuity of pressures at the seabed surface. In this study, a strongly coupled model was proposed to realize both wave <b>and</b> <b>seabed</b> processes in a same program and to calculate the wave fields <b>and</b> <b>seabed</b> response simultaneously. The information between wave fields <b>and</b> <b>seabed</b> fields were strongly shared and thus results in a more profound investigation of the mechanism of the wave–seabed interaction. In this letter, the wave <b>and</b> <b>seabed</b> models were validated with previous experimental tests. Then, a set of application of present model were discussed in prediction of the wave-induced seabed response. Numerical results show the wave-induced liquefaction area of coupled model is smaller than that of uncoupled model...|$|R

5|$|There is {{a broader}} {{spectrum}} of higher animal taxa {{in the sea}} than on land, many marine species {{have yet to be}} discovered, and the number known to science is expanding annually.

In fact, the oceans teem with life and provide many varying microhabitats. One of these is the surface film which—despite being tossed about by the movement of waves—provides a rich environment and is home to bacteria, fungi, microalgae, protozoa, fish eggs, and various larvae.|$|E
