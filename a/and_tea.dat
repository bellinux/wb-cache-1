5|$|Blair is {{pregnant}} with Patrick's baby, {{who has been}} identified as a donor match for Starr. She gives birth to his stillborn son in 1997. Todd blames Patrick for the miscarriage and frames him for the murder of billionaire and Llanview newcomer Guy Armitage. Blair learns that Todd caused the explosion that killed Guy, and divorces him in June. When Blair falls into a coma, Todd pays lawyer Téa Delgado (Florencia Lozano) five million dollars to marry him so he can keep custody of Starr. When Blair awakens, he allows Blair visitation. In 1998, while Todd <b>and</b> <b>Téa</b> grow closer, Todd is again accused of rape; Blair and Sam Rappaport (Kale Browne), a lawyer and father-figure to Todd, help prove his innocence. Back in town upon Todd's request, he also intends to help Todd save his tempestuous marriage to Téa. In the interim, Todd and Blair grow closer, and Blair <b>and</b> <b>Téa</b> vie for Todd's affections. As Todd <b>and</b> <b>Téa</b> fall in love, Blair moves on with Sam. When Todd is about to be arrested for the murder of a woman named Georgie Phillips, he takes the other fourteen suspects hostage at the Buchanan family cabin with fake dynamite strapped to his chest. Rachel Gannon admits to the murder, but Todd is arrested for the hostage incident. He fakes dissociative identity disorder (split personalities) to avoid conviction and keep Téa in his life. Téa divorces him as part of his defense strategy, but they remarry in November. During the reception, a tape on which Todd confesses to faking his split personalities is accidentally played at Starr's request. Téa refuses his offer of another five million to stay married to him. He leaves town in December, <b>and</b> <b>Tea</b> has the marriage annulled in 1999.|$|E

40|$|Dehydro pyrrolizidine {{alkaloids}} (dehydro PAs) are carcinogenic phytotoxins {{prevalent in the}} Boraginaceae, Asteraceae and Fabaceae families. Dehydro PAs enter the food and feed chain by co-harvesting of crops intended for human and animal consumption {{as well as by}} carry-over into animal-based products such as milk, eggs and honey. Recently the occurrence of dehydro PAs in <b>teas</b> <b>and</b> herbal <b>teas</b> has gained increasing attention from the EU, due to the high levels of dehydro PAs found in commercially available <b>teas</b> <b>and</b> herbal <b>teas</b> in Germany <b>and</b> Switzerland. Furthermore, several tropane alkaloids (TAs, e. g. scopolamine and hyoscyamine) intoxications due to the consumption of contaminated herbal teas were reported in the literature. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the dehydro PAs and TAs levels in 70 pre-packed teabags of herbal <b>and</b> non-herbal <b>tea</b> types sold in supermarkets in Israel. Chamomile, peppermint <b>and</b> rooibos <b>teas</b> contained high dehydro PAs levels in almost all samples analysed. Lower amounts were detected in black <b>and</b> green <b>teas,</b> while no dehydro PAs were found in fennel <b>and</b> melissa herbal <b>teas.</b> Total dehydro PAs concentrations in chamomile, peppermint <b>and</b> rooibos <b>teas</b> ranged from 20 to 1729 μg/kg. Except for black tea containing only mono-ester retrorsine-type dehydro PAs, all other <b>teas</b> <b>and</b> herbal <b>teas</b> showed mixed patterns of dehydro PA ester types, indicating a contamination by various weed species during harvesting and/or production. The TA levels per teabag were below the recommended acute reference dose; however, the positive findings of TAs in all peppermint tea samples warrant a more extensive survey. The partially high levels of dehydro PAs found in <b>teas</b> <b>and</b> herbal <b>teas</b> present an urgent warning letter to the regulatory authorities to perform routine quality control analysis and implement maximum residual levels for dehydro PAs. </p...|$|R

5|$|A {{feature of}} central York is the Snickelways, narrow {{pedestrian}} routes, {{many of which}} led towards the former market-places in Pavement and St Sampson's Square.

5|$|After the Nazis {{seized power}} {{the family moved}} first to Möhlstrasse in Munich, and in 1934 to Lake Tegern, where they bought a house.

5|$|At {{the end of}} May, David Ben-Gurion was {{convinced}} that the Arab Legion expected to take control of all Jerusalem. Moreover, after the fighting, the situation there deteriorated: the Jewish community had very small reserves of fuel, bread, sugar <b>and</b> <b>tea,</b> which would last for only 10 days, and water for 3 months. In Glubb's opinion, the aim was still to prevent the Israelis from reinforcing the city and taking control of its Arab part. On 29 May, the UN Security Council announced its intention to impose a ceasefire for 4 weeks, which would prevent further capture of territory and thus prevent resupplying the besieged city.|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{cytogenetic}} {{effects of}} black <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> green <b>tea</b> were determined in cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes. Results showed that black <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> green <b>tea</b> induced the mitotic and replication indexes and decreased micronuclei. But {{these data were}} not statistically significant for green tea. The effects of black tea on the micronucleus formation and mitotic index were statistically significant. The decrease in micronucleus counts indicated that black <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> green <b>tea</b> had considerable anticlastogenic and antigenotoxic effects as observed in vitro in human lymphocytes. Thus, it could be concluded that tea polyphenols protected the normal cells from genotoxic or carcinogenic agents, which indicated the therapeutic and antioxidative role of catechins, flavonoids or other tea compounds...|$|R
