25|$|Government TVETs are {{particularly}} concerned with occupations requiring investment in {{machinery and equipment}} and with increasing provision in remote areas. Workshop provision varies in quality. Some TVETs have good provision but many others have a shortage of workshops or old dilapidated workshops that lack safety features, basic sanitary facilities and essential equipment. Classrooms, stores and libraries may be in poor condition or non-existent. Instructors may lack competence since, in 2012, only 53% of those assessed met the <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria.</b> Even when TVETs have machinery and equipment, {{there are too many}} students for the few resources available. Students cannot meet the 70% to 80% requirement for practice and training remains theory based. Consequently, students have difficulty in meeting the <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria</b> with only 23% of students being found competent in 2012. Students who do graduate may still find it hard to get work. The Amhara TVET promotion bureau found only about 40% of TVET graduates managed to obtain employment.|$|E

Although these standards are usually available on request or on the organisation's website, the <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria</b> are often not available to the public, making a direct comparison of standards difficult. Most agencies comply with the minimum requirements of the World Recreational Scuba Training Council (WRSTC) or ISO for the relevant certification (ISO 24801-2 Autonomous diver, and ISO 24801-3 Dive leader), but most certification levels are not defined by the international standards.|$|E

In order to overcome this problem, a unified performance <b>assessment</b> <b>criterion</b> based on both of these usual performance parameters is suggested in the present paper.

These three perspectives include the resident population, the immigrant and the sending country viewpoints. An expanded version of Julian Simon?s financial transfer model which includes employment and capital externalities is developed to assess the efficacy of an immigration policy from the resident?s viewpoint. Next, Chiswick?s earnings ?catch-up? model is expanded in an employment dimension to create an <b>assessment</b> <b>criterion</b> for the resident immigrant population. Finally, a comprehensive reverse transfer criterion is outlined to provide an <b>assessment</b> <b>criterion</b> for sending regions.

25|$|Scuba skills {{training}} is primarily provided by practical instruction {{under the guidance}} of a registered or certified diving instructor, {{on the assumption that the}} instructor is both competent and willing to provide a quality of training and assessment according to the relevant training standards, and to ensure that the learner is competent according to the <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria</b> applied. Additional practice of the skills is the responsibility of the diver, and is generally necessary to reach and retain a level of competence sufficient to deal with the foreseeable contingencies which may occur during diving under the range of conditions in which the diver is certified to dive. Recreational divers may attend refresher courses when they have not dived for a significant period, in which the instructor ensures that they are still competent in the skills required by their certification, and it is not uncommon for service providers like dive shops and charter boats to require a checkout dive from divers unfamiliar with the region, or unable to show sufficient evidence of adequate current skill level. The checkout dive is usually a demonstration by the diver of basic skills appropriate to the expected conditions, and may be assessed by an instructor or divemaster. These refresher courses and checkout dives are usually informal, and may vary considerably.|$|E
500|$|A {{review of}} semipalmated sandpiper records {{took place in}} the 1970s, {{resulting}} in seven of the twelve records being rejected. A review of black-headed wagtail records was initiated in 1983. The results were published in 1994 and 1995, and nine previously accepted records were judged to be unsound, due to possible confusion with grey-headed wagtail. A review of rufous turtle dove records took place in 1994, and concluded that three of the eight accepted records should no longer stand. A review of lesser kestrel records, begun in 1994, and completed in 1995, concluded that six accepted records of this species should no longer be regarded as acceptable. Five of the six were from autumn, whereas the overwhelming majority of records the committee continued to accept are from the spring/summer period. All 24 spring records of Siberian stonechat were reconsidered in 2002–04, in the light of new information on the variability in appearance of European stonechats in spring; the committee decided that all but five should remain accepted. In 2003, the committee revised its <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria</b> for male pine buntings, redefining some birds previously considered hybrids [...] as acceptable, but requiring an overall greater level of precision in descriptions, and reviewed past records in the light of these changes.|$|E

In the literature, the susceptibility of randomization procedures to both selection and chronological bias is already well studied. However, no optimality statement is given for the selection of a randomization procedure, when both types of bias are present simultaneously. Therefore, a linked <b>assessment</b> <b>criterion</b> for the selection of an appropriate randomization procedure is presented. The linked <b>assessment</b> <b>criterion</b> is based on desirability functions.

2500|$|Newbury {{was chosen}} {{as an example of}} a small town that could be redeveloped {{following}} this pattern, with vehicles easily integrating into the urban scenery. But the report warned that the commitment and scale of work required would be hitherto unheard of. The concept was mainly ignored for 25 years until the A34 Newbury bypass was proposed, alongside extensive pedestrianisation and road changes within the urban areas. The new roads dramatically reduced the impact of motor vehicles on the town, especially heavy goods vehicles, and accompanied the reinvigoration of Newbury which had managed to retain its historic core. When completed in 1998 the actual bypass followed approximately the same route as the original proposal, but encountered such protest from so many quarters that all other UK road schemes were soon stalled.

A “moderate,” “weak,” or “very weak” level of proof resulted in a “conditional” recommendation (“should probably be done”, “should probably not be done…”).
