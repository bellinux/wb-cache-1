While campaigning for her husband's re-election in 2004, she cited the campaign as their last, though this would later be disputed when she campaigned for Republicans across the country in the 2006 midterm elections. She was credited with having raised $15 million for his campaign as well as the Republican Party while still succeeding in keeping a separate schedule that allowed for her to tend to the traditional duties she had as First Lady.|$|E
500|$|Peter Bergen, {{writing for}} The Nation, offered a {{detailed}} {{critique of the}} film. Bergen wrote that even if al-Qaeda is not as organised <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> stressed, {{it is still a}} very dangerous force due to the fanaticism of its followers and the resources available to bin Laden. On Curtis's claim that al-Qaeda was a creation of neoconservative politicians, Bergen said, [...] "This is nonsense. There is substantial evidence that Al Qaeda was founded in 1988 by bin Laden and a small group of like-minded militants, and that the group would mushroom into the secretive, disciplined organisation that implemented the 9/11 attacks." [...] Bergen further claimed that Curtis's arguments serve as a defence of Bush's failure to capture bin Laden in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and his ignoring warnings of a terrorist attack prior to 11 September.|$|E

2500|$|Princeton University {{research}} fellow Dr. Jonathan Monten, in his 2005 International Security journal article [...] "The Roots of <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> Doctrine: Power, Nationalism, and Democracy Promotion in U.S. Strategy", attributed <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration's activist democracy promotion to two main factors: {{the expansion of}} material capabilities, {{and the presence of}} a nationalist domestic ideology. He claims that <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> Doctrine promotion of democracy abroad was held <b>as</b> vital by <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> to <b>the</b> success of the United States in the [...] "war on terror". It was also a key objective of the administration's grand strategy of expanding the political and economic influence of the United States internationally. He examines two contending approaches to the long-term promotion of democracy: [...] "exemplarism," [...] or leadership by example, and [...] "vindicationism," [...] or the direct application of United States power, including the use of coercive force. Whereas exemplarism largely prevailed in the 20th century, vindicationism has been the preferred approach of <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration.</b>|$|R
