40|$|Supplemental damping {{can be used}} as a {{cost-effective}} method to reduce structural vibrations. In particular, passive systems are now widely accepted and have numerous applications in the field. However, they are typically tuned to specific excitations and their performances are bandwidth-limited. A solution is to use semi-active devices, which have shown to be capable of substantially enhanced mitigation performance. The authors have recently proposed a new type of semi-active device, which consists of a variable friction mechanism based on a vehicle duo-servo drum brake, a mechanically robust and reliable technology. The theoretical performance of the proposed device has been previously demonstrated via numerical simulations. In this paper, we further the understanding of the device, termed Modified Friction Device (MFD) by fabricating a small scale prototype and characterizing its dynamic behavior. While the dynamics of friction is well understood for automotive braking technology, we investigate for the first time the dynamic behavior of this friction mechanism at low displacements and velocities, in both forward and backward directions, under various hydraulic pressures. A modified 3 -stage dynamic model is introduced. A LuGre friction model is used to characterize the friction zone (Stage 1), and two pure stiffness regions to characterize the dynamics of the MFD once the rotation is reversed and the braking shoes are sticking to the drum (Stage 2) and the rapid build up of forces once the shoes are held by the <b>anchor</b> <b>pin</b> (Stage 3). The proposed model is identified experimentally by subjecting the prototype to harmonic excitations. It is found that the proposed model can be used to characterize the dynamics of the MFD, and that the largest fitting error arises at low velocity under low pressure input. The model is then verified by subjecting the MFD to two different earthquake excitations under different pressure inputs. The model is capable of tracking the device׳s response, despite a lower fitting performance under low pressure and small force output, as it was found in the harmonic tests due to the possible nonlinearity in Stage 2 of the model...|$|E

The idea behind designing such a graft came from the intention to broad the instruction for use (IFU) and to enable it to treat more challenging anatomy including the 10 mm neck lengths, and more severe suprarenal and infrarenal angulations. Endurant stent-graft has active fixation through suprarenal stent with <b>anchoring</b> <b>pins</b> to provide migration resistance, optimized heights of stents and spacing between them for improved flexibility and conformability, low-profile delivery system with hydrophilic coating and controlled simple deployment mechanism. Short term results are excellent. Technical and clinical success is confirmed in Regulatory trials (EU and USA), as well as in ENGAGE and the Canadian registry. Many current publications record the use of Endurant stent-graft outside the Instruction for use. The results in a group of patients outside the instruction for use are comparable to those within instruction for use; with the exception of perioperative proximal endoleak type I.

40|$|Background:. Multidirectional cranial {{distraction}} osteogenesis (MCDO) is {{a procedure}} of ours developed earlier for treating craniosynostosis. However, the numerous bone flaps led to prolonged operative time and occasional bone detachment from dura. We have since simplified the osteotomy design. In treating sagittal synostosis, required bone flaps {{have been reduced}} to 11 (from ~ 20). Methods:. In a 2 -year period (2014 – 2015), 5 boys with sagittal synostosis underwent MCDO using our simplified and fixed-form osteotomy. Mean age at surgery was 9. 4 months (range, 8 – 11 months). Pre- and postoperative cranial morphology was assessed by cephalic index and by mid-sagittal vector analysis. Results:. Improved cranial shape was confirmed by 3 -dimensional CT scans and by mid-sagittal vector index. Mean preoperative cephalic index (68. 7) progressively increased to means of 78. 5 immediately after distraction device removal, 75. 2 at postoperative month 6, and 75. 1 at 1 year postoperatively. There were no major complications, although transient cerebrospinal fluid leakage and loosening of <b>anchor</b> <b>pins</b> occurred in 1 patient. Conclusions:. Simplified MCDO has a number of advantages over conventional distraction procedures such as discretionary reshaping/expansion of cranium and predictable osteogenesis and is a valid treatment option for patients with sagittal synostosis...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Articular {{cartilage}} {{has limited}} repair capacity. Two different implant devices for articular cartilage regeneration {{were tested in}} vivo in a sheep model to evaluate the effect of subchondral bone anchoring for tissue repair. METHODS: The implants were placed with press-fit technique in a cartilage defect after microfracture surgery in the femoral condyle of the knee joint of the sheep and histologic and mechanical evaluation was done 4. 5 months later. The first group consisted of a biodegradable polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffold with double porosity. The second test group consisted of a PCL scaffold attached to a poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) <b>pin</b> <b>anchored</b> to the subchondral bone. RESULTS: For both groups most of the defects (75 %) showed an articular surface that was completely or almost completely repaired with a neotissue. Nevertheless, the surface had a rougher appearance than controls and the repair tissue was immature. In the trials with solely scaffold implantation, severe subchondral bone alterations were seen with many large nodular formations. These alterations were ameliorated when implanting the scaffold with a subchondral bone <b>anchoring</b> <b>pin.</b> DISCUSSIONS: The results show that tissue repair is improved by implanting a PCL scaffold compared to solely microfracture surgery, and most importantly, that subchondral bone alterations, normally seen after microfracture surgery, were partially prevented when implanting the PCL scaffold with a fixation system to the subchondral bone.

40|$|To prevent hole {{collapse}} during lunar drilling operations, {{a casing}} has been devised of a graphite reinforced polyimide composite {{which will be}} able to withstand the lunar environment. Additionally, this casing will be inserted into the ground in segments two meters long which will penetrate the regolith simultaneously with the auger. The vertical action of the mobile platform will provide a downward force to the casing string through a special adaptor, giving the casing the needed impetus to sink the anticipated depth of ten meters. Casing segments will be connected with a simple snap arrangement. Excess casing will be cut off by a cylindrical cutting tool which will also transport the excess casing away from the hole. A footplate will be incorporated to grasp the auger rod string during rod segment additions or removals. The footplate grasping mechanism will consist of a set of vice-like arms, one end of each bearing threaded to a common power screw. The power screw will be threaded such that one end's thread pitch opposes that of the other end. The weight of the auger and rod string will be transmitted through the arms to the power screw and absorbed by a set of three ball bearing assemblies.

30|$|There {{are several}} {{limitations}} to our study. As with any biomechanical study, the study conditions are idealized {{in a laboratory}} and might not adequately reflect physiological loading conditions. The forces we used attempted to simulate a patient walking upstairs/downstairs, which would put the patient’s proximal tibia under higher forces than just walking on level ground [7, 8]. Our applicability to other studies involving the proximal tibia might be limited because of the variability in creating proximal tibial defects. We chose to use lateral plateau defects for our study, and there {{is likely to be}} differences in loading between the medial and lateral tibial plateau. However, we only loaded the side of the tibia with the defect, and our results likely represent the direct strength {{on that side of the}} construct. There was variability in the size and bone quality of the tibias used in this study. We used paired tibias for the study in an attempt to negate this effect. The difference in size and bone quality of the tibias is also likely to represent the variety of patients that would be seen in clinical practice. We chose to use intramedullary Steinmann pins for our study, but other studies also look at using divergent <b>pins</b> <b>anchored</b> into the intact portion of the tibial plateau. We would have been unable to pair the tibias if we included a third experimental group into our study, so we chose not to include this group. Finally, the surgery to implant a locking plate would require a larger dissection and periosteal disruption that the surgery to implant intramedullary Steinmann pins. This could theoretically decrease the healing potential after surgery in these patients.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reports the}} results of a {{research}} on the static consolidation of an important XV century tower by Bramante belonging to an important monumental complex located in the Po Valley which was showing worrying structural conditions. The tower, 19 m high, very thin, lacking connections in the highest part, showed overturnings of the four façades not in plumb by over 150 mm; Due to the presence of architectural terracotta elements, {{it was not possible to}} intervene on the external facades. This is why the authors decided to create a sort of hoop from inside using a U (120 mm) steel profile fastened to the walls by means of steel <b>pins</b> <b>anchored</b> with epoxy resins. The pins (12 mm, 350 mm length) have been positioned at a distance of 50 cm inclined by 30 ° alternatively downwards and upwards in order to get at minimum of 2 + 2 courses of bricks. Then, by a series of steel tie rods it was possible to tie the opposite walls. Finally, triangular frames have been positioned on the 4 corners in order to avoid teething collapse in case of great stress. Before starting with the strengthening work, as described above, experimental tests, supported by the Bossong company, were conducted to verify tensile stress resistance of each pin. The tests studied different solutions in terms of diameter and anchoring material. The tensile tests, carried out by using a specific hydraulic puller equipped with a dynamometer and a displacement transducer, showed very high allowable loads, between 20 and 60 kN/pin depending on the pin and fastening type. According to data obtained, the most suitable solution was chosen; it was also used in other parts of the castle. The behavior of the reinforced structure, which withstood the February 2012 earthquake without any problem demonstrated the validity of the proposed technique which is an interesting, non invasive solution for historical buildings...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} a {{concrete}} sandwich panel originated in the United States in 1906 where a building was constructed with sandwich tilt-up wall panels. Since then sandwich panels have developed gradually and have continued to improve. [...] There {{are two types of}} concrete sandwich wall panels: (1) Architectural wall panels (non-composite type), and (2) Load bearing wall panels (composite and non-composite type). [...] In general, the non-composite type of load bearing panel is used more commonly because there are less limitations compared with the composite types. This thesis deals with the structural design and analysis of the non-composite type of load bearing wall panel. [...] In the past, certain problems besetted architects, engineers, and contractors working with concrete sandwich panels. These problems are associated with: [...] (1) Bonding between concrete and insulation [...] (2) Joints in panel [...] (3) Panel connections [...] (4) Control of cracking. [...] This study has been undertaken with the aim of solving some of these problems. Three experiments were conducted accordingly to determine the behavior of concrete sandwich panels. The first experiment was to investigate the effects of heating and cooling on sandwich panels and to compare the experimental results with theoretical calculations. The principal results of this experiment demonstrated the effects on concrete sandwich panels under varying thermal conditions. These results should serve as a guideline for the design of joints in sandwich panels. The second and third experiments were initiated to investigate and compare the bending stresses, deflections and shear strength in concrete sandwich panels either with or without shear connectors. The panels were subjected to a simulated uniformly distributed load under simply supported conditions. It can be concluded from the experimental results that a well designed anchor system joining the concrete sandwich panel faces through the core insulation is a fundamental requirement in the future production of sandwich wall panels in order to obtain full shear transfer between the faces. Without these shear connectors, a concrete structural sandwich panel will usually fail by shear of the bond between the core and faces or by shear failure of the core itself. [...] The deflection on a sandwich panel is the sum of ordinary bending deflection and an additional deflection associated with shear deformation of the core. Experimental results showed that deflections were mainly associated with shear deformation of the core for panels without shear connectors. [...] Deflections measured were less for panels containing shear connectors. For both panels, from theoretical calculations, {{it was found that the}} deflections were mainly associated with shear deformation, with less than 1 % due to bending. [...] A proper shear connector system transfers all lateral loads including wind forces from the exterior face to the interior structural face of the panel. Hence the sleeve anchor, torsion <b>anchors</b> and connector <b>pins</b> play a very important part in the performance of concrete sandwich panels. Prestressing techniques can also improve the design of such panels and have been widely used in recent developments of sandwich panels. [...] For this study, a typical non-composite type of concrete sandwich panel was selected as a design example. For the design of such concrete sandwich panels, the following factors were carefully considered: [...] (1) The thickness of both faces of the panel [...] (2) The loading conditions [...] (3) The fire resistance of the sandwich panel [...] (4) The temperature gradient between the faces, and [...] (5) The panel anchor system...|$|R
