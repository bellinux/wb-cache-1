Eighteen other survivors were buried in a common grave in Almagro and nine other bodies, also found in Almagro, were shipped to Tacloban. In Tacloban, six other survivors were buried, but over 60survivors were also found on the island, and were transported on four buses and taken to receive medical treatment. Twenty-two were found on Samar Island, including two in Calbayog. Overall, the shipwreck was confirmed to have killed 77, even though 261others were listed missing.|$|E
5|$|A {{drawback}} to {{the device was}} found on 7 March 1948, when the firebox crown sheet of Princess Alexandra, a Coronation Pacific of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, failed while hauling a passenger train from Glasgow to London. Enquiries established that both water gauges were defective <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> journey earlier that day {{one or both of}} the fusible plugs had melted, but this had gone unnoticed by the engine crew because of the strong draught carrying the escaping steam away from them.|$|E

5|$|After Banner, Briskin {{returned}} to work at Columbia Pictures, where he began producing for them in 1926, and in 1928 he was given control over 18 of their productions. By 1929, Briskin had risen to be a top executive at the studio, sharing honors with studio head Harry Cohn, in giving the closing address at Columbia's annual sales meeting in July 1929. By the end of 1929, Briskin was the assistant general manager of Columbia, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> visit to New York City signed several Broadway playwrights to long-term contracts with the studio, including Elmer Harris, Jo Swerling, and Paul Hervey Fox. Not only was Briskin active in the production office at Columbia, but he also played on Columbia's baseball team, which competed in the Motion Picture Baseball League. It was while working at Columbia that Briskin met Frank Capra. In 1930, Briskin's brother Irving, who he had employed while at Banner, joined him as a producer at Columbia.|$|E
5|$|After {{aftershocks}} {{from the}} quake had concluded, examination took place, producing a focal {{solution to the}} small events. Movement of these shocks {{was similar to that}} of previous earthquakes around the Azores. For these earthquakes, scientists had determined that the conjugate nodal plane was responsible, seeing shearing on the right-lateral (dextral) side. All faulting in this area is strike-slip-oriented, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rather large scale. Because of this research, information now points towards Azores volcanism being controlled by earthquake movement.|$|E

5|$|After {{scouting}} Vancouver for a {{place to}} film scenes that involved the Swan house, {{the decision was made to}} recreate the house on an empty lot with a tree line and approaching road. The production team was able to rearrange the exterior of the house to match that in the first movie. When faced with creating the interior, the team measured the house in Portland, and built various pieces of the house on the lot <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> stage in Vancouver. The second film also attempted to clarify the location of Bella's room, which, as seen in the first film, seemed to be located in the front of the house, when in reality it was on the right-hand side. Complications arose when the Portland house was repainted after Twilights release, which took away the aging the house had come to depict in the film. When recreating the house, the production team referenced the first film on high-definition Blu-ray Disc.|$|E
5|$|After {{their loss}} against Howard, the Informals {{traveled}} {{to play the}} Marion Military Institute Cadets at Perry County High School Stadium. Against the Cadets, Alabama scored at least one touchdown in all four quarters for the 31–12 victory. The Informals scored first on an 80-yard Barton Greer touchdown run, only to see the Cadets tie the game at 6–6 on the next possession on a 40-yard touchdown pass. Alabama responded with a 20-yard touchdown run on a reverse by Whitey Blanchiak to take a 12–6 halftime lead. In the third quarter, the Informals extended their lead to 24–6 after Lowell Edmondson scored on a 35-yard touchdown pass from Greer <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> four-yard Frank MacAlpine touchdown run in the third quarter. In the fourth, Greer scored on a run for Alabama and Marion scored the final points of the game on a punt returned for a touchdown in their 31–12 loss.|$|E
5|$|After {{their victory}} over Marion, the Informals {{defeated}} the Cadets {{for the second}} consecutive week at Denny Stadium 19–13.

The Informals responded with a pair of second-quarter touchdowns to make the halftime score 13–12. Touchdowns were scored on a Frank MacAlpine run <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 21-yard Whitey Blanchiak reception from Barton Greer. Alabama then scored the go-ahead touchdown in the third quarter on a 55-yard interception return for a touchdown.|$|E

5|$|After {{winning the}} coin toss, Alabama elected {{to receive the}} ball to open the first half. Marquis Maze fielded the James Hairston kickoff and {{returned}} it to the Alabama 30-yard line where the offense began its first series. Alabama opened {{with a pair of}} gains by Trent Richardson on an 18-yard run <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 22-yard pass reception from AJ McCarron to reach the LSU 30-yard line. However, the drive stalled on the next three plays, and on fourth down Cade Foster missed a 44-yard field goal wide right and the game remained tied at zero. The Tigers began their first offensive series with Jarrett Lee at quarterback from their own 27-yard line. After LSU gained a pair of first downs on runs by Spencer Ware and short passes from Lee, the drive faltered, and Brad Wing punted the ball out-of-bounds at the Alabama five.|$|E

5|$|Bromine pentafluoride (BrF5) {{was first}} {{synthesised}} in 1930.

It is a very vigorous fluorinating agent, although chlorine trifluoride is still more violent. Bromine pentafluoride explodes on reaction with water and fluorinates silicates at 450°C.|$|E
