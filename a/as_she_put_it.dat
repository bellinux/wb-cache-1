500|$|Produced {{primarily}} by Timbaland and Danja, Loose showcases Furtado {{experimenting with a}} more R hop sound and, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> the [...] "surreal, theatrical elements of '80s music".|$|E
500|$|Though {{some historians}} have criticised Elizabeth on similar grounds, Raleigh's verdict has more often been judged unfair. Elizabeth {{had good reason}} not to place too much trust in her commanders, who once in action tended, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> herself, [...] "to be transported with an haviour of vainglory".|$|E
500|$|Loose {{was also}} named partly for the R girl group TLC, who Furtado said she admires for [...] "taking back their sexuality, showing they were {{complete}} women." [...] She {{said she wanted}} the album to be [...] "assertive and cool" [...] and [...] "sexy but fun", like TLC, MC Lyte, Queen Latifah and Janet Jackson, who inspired Furtado because, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> she was [...] "comfortable in her sexuality and womanhood" [...] when her 1993 single [...] "That's the Way Love Goes" [...] was released.|$|E
50|$|Lin has conceptualised {{and written}} about the art in music and music in art. Since 2002, Hsin Hsin has {{digitally}} created visual music, or animated music, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2010 Maya Tiwari renounced her monastic {{title and}} spiritual honorific—Her Holiness, Sri Swami Mayatitananda—to, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> “walk a simpler and more {{accessible}} life {{in service of}} the populations in need." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bamford {{stated in}} an {{interview}} with The Salt Lake Tribune that she has been diagnosed with bipolar II disorder, as well as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), [...] "the new gladiator sandal," [...] <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> in her comic performances.|$|R
500|$|Mary Shelley and {{her husband}} Percy Bysshe Shelley had lived in Italy from 1818 to 1823. Although Percy Shelley and two of their four {{children}} died there, Italy became for Mary Shelley [...] "a country which memory painted as paradise", <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it.</b> The couple's Italian years were a time of intense intellectual and creative activity. Percy composed a series of major poems, and Mary wrote the autobiographical novel Matilda, the historical novel Valperga, and the plays Proserpine [...] and Midas. Mary Shelley {{had always wanted to}} return to Italy and she excitedly planned her 1840 trip. The return was painful as she was constantly reminded of Percy Shelley.|$|E
500|$|Dawson City {{declined}} {{after the}} gold rush. When journalist Laura Berton (future mother of Pierre Berton) moved to Dawson in 1907 {{it was still}} thriving, but away from Front Street, the town had become increasingly deserted, jammed, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "with the refuse of the gold rush: stoves, furniture, gold-pans, sets of dishes, double-belled seltzer bottles... piles of rusting mining machinery—boilers, winches, wheelbarrows and pumps". By 1912, only around 2,000 inhabitants remained compared to the 30,000 of the boom years and the site was becoming a ghost town. By 1972, 500 people were living in Dawson whereas the nearby settlements created during the gold rush had been entirely abandoned. The population has grown since the 1970s, with 1,300 recorded in 2006.|$|E
500|$|Producer Joan Ganz Cooney has stated, [...] "Without research, {{there would}} be no Sesame Street". In 1967, when Cooney and her team began to plan the show's development, {{combining}} research with television production was, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "positively heretical". Shortly after creating Sesame Street, its producers began to develop what came to be called [...] "the CTW model", a system of planning, production, and evaluation that did not fully emerge {{until the end of the}} show's first season. According to Morrow, the CTW model consisted of four parts: [...] "the interaction of receptive television producers and child science experts, the creation of a specific and age-appropriate curriculum, research to shape the program directly, and independent measurement of viewers' learning".|$|E
5000|$|Mrs Gather, {{learning}} {{that the money}} is, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "ill-got", refuses to accept it. Edwin takes it back. David and Max smuggle Rose out through her bedroom window, and only Edwin is still there when Ernestine and the carol singers burst in.|$|R
2500|$|She {{insisted that}} her replies are not rants, rather a passionate {{education}} {{for the people who}} write and comment about transgender people in public domain. Her process of [...] "education" [...] <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> can sometimes end up in heated arguments and war of words with her fans.|$|R
5000|$|In the song, {{the narrator}} opens {{up about a}} man who is still in a troubling {{relationship}} with one woman while having a relationship with another woman. The other woman struggles to comprehend why her lover refuses to leave his past flame so she could [...] "be with him permanently" [...] <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> in the end.|$|R
500|$|While {{the books}} {{could be said}} to {{comprise}} many other themes, such as power/abuse of power, violence and hatred, love, loss, prejudice, and free choice, they are, as Rowling states, [...] "deeply entrenched in the whole plot"; the writer prefers to let themes [...] "grow organically", rather than sitting down and consciously attempting to impart such ideas to her readers. Along the same lines is the ever-present theme of adolescence, in whose depiction Rowling has been purposeful in acknowledging her characters' sexualities and not leaving Harry, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "stuck in a state of permanent pre-pubescence". Rowling has also been praised for her nuanced depiction {{of the ways in which}} death and violence affects youth, and humanity as a whole.|$|E
500|$|Employing Brent Thomson as his new manager, she {{suggested}} that Sylvester rid himself of his androgynous image and wear more masculine clothing {{in order to gain}} a recording contract; <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "nobody is giving out recording contracts to drag queens." [...] Thomson opened auditions for new backing singers, with Sylvester being captivated by one of those auditioning, Martha Wash. Sylvester asked her if she had another large black friend who could sing, after which she introduced him to Izora Rhodes. Although he referred to them simply as [...] "the girls", Wash and Rhodes named themselves the Two Tons O' Fun (and much later, when they achieved mainstream success, as The Weather Girls), and continued to work with Sylvester intermittently until his death, developing a close friendship with him. They were soon joined by bassist John Dunstan and keyboard player Dan Reich.|$|E
500|$|Pryce took an {{interest}} in cars while driving a baker's van at the age of 10, before informing his parents {{that he wanted to be}} a racing driver. During an interview with Alan Henry in 1975, he stated that he had wanted to become a pilot, but thought he was not intelligent enough. Like many future Formula One drivers, Pryce had a childhood racing hero. In his case it was Lotus's Scottish driver Jim Clark. Pryce's mother recalled that he was very upset when Clark died at the Hockenheimring in April 1968. His father noted that [...] "he was very upset when Jochen Rindt was killed, too". After he left school at 16, Pryce's mother insisted that he take an apprenticeship as a tractor mechanic at Llandrillo Technical College, giving him [...] "something to fall back on", <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> if his career as a racing driver was unsuccessful.|$|E
50|$|Though she {{is deeply}} {{committed}} to Carrot, even likening herself to being his dog (or <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> in Jingo, a wolf that lives with humans) it hasn't stopped others with romantic interest; there is tension with a wolf named Gavin in The Fifth Elephant, and she receives a marriage proposal from the small mutt Mr. Fusspot in Making Money.|$|R
6000|$|... "That won't quite do, Mr. Quatermain," [...] {{answered}} Heda with a laugh, [...] "since she is {{even more}} jealous of you. With reference to Maurice, she explains frankly that if we marry <b>she</b> might, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> 'continue to sit outside the hut,' but that in your case you live 'in my head,' where she cannot come between you and me." ...|$|R
5000|$|She is {{revealed}} to be a college graduate successfully skipping several grades, and {{that she is a}} shut-in only because she finds comfort in home <b>as</b> <b>she</b> has no [...] "dark history" [...] <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> and that <b>she</b> pays her taxes accordingly so she sees no problem in her current life-style (both her shut-in life and her Detective work) and merely likes it that way.|$|R
500|$|Though Silent Spring had {{generated}} a fairly {{high level of}} interest based on pre-publication promotion, this became much more intense with the serialization in The New Yorker, {{which began in the}} June 16, 1962, issue. This brought the book {{to the attention of the}} chemical industry and its lobbyists, as well as a wide swath of the American populace. Around that time Carson also learned that Silent Spring had been selected as the Book-of-the-Month for October; <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> this would [...] "carry it to farms and hamlets all over that country that don't know what a bookstore looks like—much less The New Yorker." [...] Other publicity included a positive editorial in The New York Times and excerpts of the serialized version in Audubon magazine, with another round of publicity in July and August as chemical companies responded. The story of the birth defect-causing drug thalidomide broke just before the book's publication as well, inviting comparisons between Carson and Frances Oldham Kelsey, the Food and Drug Administration reviewer who had blocked the drug's sale in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Strickland {{was born}} in Blackshear, Georgia to Susan Strickland, a nurse, and Dee Strickland, a high school {{football}} coach, principal and superintendent. KaDee's birthname is Katherine Dee; her parents combined the K in Katherine with her father's name to make KaDee. She was raised in Patterson, Georgia, which she said is a [...] "one-stoplight town", {{and she had a}} job picking tobacco on a local farm for eight years. When she was a child, Strickland watched the Woody Allen film Annie Hall (1975) and was, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "wanting to be in that place, and being completely taken with the energy of those people. I wanted to be in it". During her childhood, she was well known locally {{as a member of the}} Strickland family and for her extracurricular activities and achievements (she was the Homecoming Queen in elementary, middle and high school, the student council president and a cheerleader). She never considered a career in the performing arts until her participation in a one-act play performed by students of her high school: [...] " [...] the minute I set foot on stage, that was it. Destiny took over. There were no other options. I felt like I fit my skin, I knew what I was here to do", Strickland said.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1967 Cooney took {{a leave of absence}} from WNDT and, funded by Carnegie Corporation, {{traveled}} the U.S. and Canada interviewing experts in child development, education, and television. [...] She reported her findings in a fifty-five-page document entitled [...] "The Potential Uses of Television in Preschool Education". [...] The report, which Gikow called [...] "a schematic for the show Sesame Street would become", described what the new show would look like and proposed the creation of a company that oversaw its production, which eventually became known as the Children's Television Workshop (CTW). [...] Cooney later stated that her undergraduate training in Education helped her research and write the study, and that it, along with her Emmy, provided her with credibility in the eyes of both the experts she interviewed and the new show's funding sources. [...] Davis credited Cooney's motivation to be involved with the project with her journalism skills, learned early in her career, and her idealism, which drove her to want to, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "make a difference". [...] She later told an interviewer, [...] "I could do a thousand documentaries on poverty and poor people that would be watched by a handful of the convinced, but I was never really going to have an influence on my times". [...] She later told Davis, [...] "Preschoolers were not necessarily my thing. [...] It was using television in a constructive way that turned me on".|$|E
50|$|When Marvin's wife demands he grow up {{and move}} with her to New York, where she is opening a restaurant, he breaks up with her instead, giving his loyalty to a film that, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> nobody wants to see. On the verge of signing contracts, {{everything}} falls apart, when Beverly discovers that the role she expected to play has been drastically reduced in Peggy's favor.|$|R
5000|$|She meets a {{young man}} named Saul from Eretz Israel, who {{encourages}} recently liberated Jews to migrate to Mandate Palestine and its relative freedoms along with other Jewish refugees. She is housed along with other recently liberated Jews, which include men and women of all ages. Although Ruth believes there is no hope, she agrees to migrate with the refugees, since, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> ″she has nothing better to do." ...|$|R
5000|$|Young played {{contract}} bridge, was a Dodgers fan, and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> once <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> bowled a [...] "pretty good game." ...|$|R
2500|$|Short {{approved}} of the NATO bombing of the headquarters of Serbian state television, in which sixteen media workers were killed and sixteen others wounded, because the station was, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "a source of propaganda".|$|E
2500|$|Polly's {{family was}} not fabulously rich, {{but her father}} had been raised, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "to ride to hounds, sail boats, and lead cotillions", and he lived high. In 1914, she was {{presented}} to the King of England at a garden party. And in keeping with the American aristocratic style of the times, she was even photographed as a child by Charles Dana Gibson.|$|E
2500|$|While {{working as}} a public school teacher, Mona would often invite {{students}} to her home on the weekends who were having difficulty with the topics. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> this was “to introduce them to the concepts {{for the next week}} so they could cope. [...] Milton would serve some milk and cookies and play music for them. [...] It made such a {{difference in the lives of}} a lot of those children.” [...] Mona credits her parents with helping her understand the value of education for improving one’s life, noting, “My parents always believed in education and I mean they made it a very, very important part of our lives.” ...|$|E
50|$|Deirdre Bennett (Maureen Mueller): The medical {{partner who}} {{comes off as}} aloof, or <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> “a {{complete}} bitch,” and is not above exploiting a situation for her own benefit. However, she is very protective of her patients and her partners, especially Mike. Deirdre also has a weakness for the wrong men, like her married lover Steve. At one point, prior to current events in the show, she had one tryst with Mike.|$|R
5000|$|Amanda {{is obsessed}} with finding a suitor (or, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> a [...] "gentleman caller") for Laura, whose {{crippling}} shyness has led her {{to drop out of}} both high school and a subsequent secretarial course, and who spends much of her time polishing and arranging her collection of little glass animals. Pressured by his mother to help find a caller for Laura, Tom invites an acquaintance from work named Jim home for dinner.|$|R
5000|$|.....a Homler family relic: the immense--indeed <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> womblike--turquoise 1960 Cadillac Homler {{inherited}} from her aunt and uncle, and in which she floated through life until coming into a more practical vehicle. But Homler could not simply give up or destroy The Whale, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> called it; like any good artist, she made an installation out of it. The transformation is appropriately aquatic, {{right down to the}} ambient sound and typically Homlerian barrier reef of personal artifacts.|$|R
2500|$|Always {{a staunch}} critic of fascism, Ovid Densusianu Sr died {{unexpectedly}} on June 8, 1938, after surgery and sepsis. A year into World War II, Elena was again living in Rome, {{but had to}} return to Romania because, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "fake Latin nationalists" [...] wanted her gone. She was issued new papers attesting her move to Bucharest, and was still living there in April 1945. During the same interval, Titus Vifor reactivated his fascism. He was assigned by the Iron Guard's [...] "National Legionary State" [...] to direct the Romanian Propaganda Office in Rome, together with writers Aron Cotruș and Vintilă Horia, and, in May 1941, became its president.|$|E
2500|$|Her Collection of Poems. 1889–1903 {{became an}} {{important}} event in Russian cultural life. Having defined the world of poetry as a three-dimensional structure involving [...] "Love and Eternity meeting in Death", she discovered and explored in it her own brand of ethic and aesthetic minimalism. Symbolist writers {{were the first to}} praise her 'hint and pause' metaphor technique, as well as the art of [...] "extracting sonorous chords out of silent pianos," [...] according to Innokenty Annensky, who saw the book as the artistic peak of [...] "Russia's 15 years of modernism" [...] and argued that [...] "not a single man would ever be able to dress abstractions in clothes of such charm [...]" [...] Men admired Gippius's outspokenness too: Gippius commented on her inner conflicts, full of 'demonic temptations' (inevitable for a poet whose mission was 'creating a new, true soul', <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it),</b> with unusual frankness.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Associated Press, Furtado said that the album was a personal statement and that the central theme was love. She noted that her previous albums had songs that [...] "explored certain aspects of love, but they're not really direct love songs" [...] and the songs on Mi Plan were more simple. She also claimed that she [...] "wanted to abandon the dance-pop vibe of her last record and try a different sound." [...] Furtado explained that she decided she wanted to perform in Spanish because she did not follow commercial or sales trends and that the album was [...] "the next phase". She said that writing songs in Spanish felt [...] "very liberating" [...] allowing her to [...] "express other emotions" [...] singing in Spanish because, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "In English, especially as a woman, the moment you start to be angry, you get labelled bad-tempered like Alanis Morissette, or if you're too sad, you get written off as fragile and sappy." ...|$|E
5000|$|In December 2009, Hutchings {{created a}} blog site called [...] "The Edgy Veggie" [...] where she posted raw and vegan recipes. In 2013 she renamed it to [...] "The Edgy Veg", to, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> [...] "not be so cutesie". Also in 2013, {{she was working}} with the company, Belmonte Raw, as an {{administrative}} supervisor. As of March, 2017, her website received over 200,00 pageviews per month and is regularly referenced by media and other vegan chefs.|$|R

This locus of bodily encounters, like Anzaldúa’s text itself, is also clearly a gendered space: <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> it is her home, the politicized place she speaks from—the place of the Chicana, the new mestiza.
