The {{weathering}} {{of these}} minerals is fundamental {{in the understanding}} of potassium, silicon and magnesium liberation processes to the soil. the existent studies shown that the main factors that control the micas weathering are the pH of the solutions, the temperature, the size of the particles and the superficial area. The micas weathering is incongruous, in other words, always new minerals are formed as dissolution products, as vermiculite, kaolinite and goethite. These products can precipitate in the surface of the mica, especially the iron oxides of iron, and they impede the contact with its surface, reducing the <b>dissolution</b> <b>kinetics.</b> The structure of the micas is also a decisive factor in the <b>dissolution</b> <b>kinetics.</b> The <b>dissolution</b> <b>kinetics</b> presents the following decreasing order: phlogopite, biotite, and muscovite. 200...|$|R

Over 80 % of the Mg was leached from the dehydroxylated lizardite particles. We then followed it up by developing a non-steady state <b>dissolution</b> <b>kinetics</b> model.

In this context <b>dissolution</b> <b>kinetics</b> of AFm (hydrated calcium aluminates) {{have been studied}} with flow-through experiments at pH ranging from 9. 2 to 13. <b>Dissolution</b> <b>kinetics</b> of a pure AFm-Cl, i. e. a mix between the Friedel's salt and its naturally-occurring form, hydrocalumite, have been investigated. Mineralogical (XRD) and chemical (EPMA, TEM/EDX) analyses have been performed to characterize the reacting minerals prior and after dissolution experiments. For pH values ranging from 10 to 13, flow-through experiments indicate congruent dissolutions of AFm-Cl (i. e. Ca/Al ratios close to 2 both for solids and outlet concentrations). In contrast a precipitation of Al-phases and mixed Al/Ca phases are expected at pH 9. 2 leading to high Ca/Al ratios of outlet solutions. However, estimated rate in such condition appears to be weakly affected by these secondary-phase formations.

Experiments were conducted with the objective to determine the influence of initial pCO 2, temperature, dissolved foreign ions and material on the <b>dissolution</b> <b>kinetics</b> of calcium carbonate. A dataset emerged, which can be implemented into models of karst evolution accounting for different chemical boundary conditions. The batch experiment using the free drift method was chosen for measuring dissolution rates in closed system conditions with respect to CO 2. The <b>dissolution</b> <b>kinetics</b> of the studied materials react differently to the presence of foreign ions in solution.

40|$|<b>Dissolution</b> <b>kinetics</b> of the (110) face of {{salicylic}} acid {{in aqueous solution}} is determined by hopping intermittent contact-scanning electrochemical microscopy (HIC-SECM) using a 2. 5 μm diameter platinum ultramicroelectrode (UME). The method operates by translating the probe UME towards the surface at a series of positions across the crystal and inducing dissolution via the reduction of protons to hydrogen, which titrates the weak acid and promotes the dissolution reaction, but only when the UME {{is close to the}} crystal. Most importantly, as dissolution is only briefly and transiently induced at each location, the initial <b>dissolution</b> <b>kinetics</b> of an as-grown single crystal surface can be measured, rather than a surface which has undergone significant dissolution (pitting), as in other techniques. Mass transport and kinetics in the system are modelled using finite element method simulations which allows dissolution rate constants to be evaluated. It is found that the kinetics of an ‘as-grown’ crystal are much slower than for a surface that has undergone partial bulk dissolution (mimicking conventional techniques), which can be attributed to a dramatic change in surface morphology as identified by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The ‘as-grown’ (110) surface presents extended terrace structures to the solution which evidently dissolve slowly, whereas a partially dissolved surface has extensive etch features and step sites which greatly enhance <b>dissolution</b> <b>kinetics.</b> This means that crystals such as {{salicylic acid}} will show time-dependent <b>dissolution</b> <b>kinetics</b> (fluxes) that are strongly dependent on crystal history, and this needs {{to be taken into account}} to fully understand dissolution. ...|$|R
