50|$|In telephony, a {{standard}} audio signal {{for a single}} phone call is encoded as 8000 analog samples per second, of 8 bits each, giving a 64 kbit/s digital signal known as DS0. The default signal compression encoding on a DS0 is either μ-law (mu-law) PCM (North America and Japan) or <b>A-law</b> <b>PCM</b> (Europe {{and most of the}} rest of the world). These are logarithmic compression systems where a 13 or 14 bit linear PCM sample number is mapped into an 8 bit value. This system is described by international standard G.711. Where circuit costs are high and loss of voice quality is acceptable, it sometimes makes sense to compress the voice signal even further. An ADPCM algorithm is used to map a series of 8 bit µ-law (or <b>a-law)</b> <b>PCM</b> samples into a series of 4 bit ADPCM samples. In this way, the capacity of the line is doubled. The technique is detailed in the G.726 standard.|$|E

The default signal compression encoding on a DS0 is either μ-law (mu-law) PCM (North America and Japan) or <b>A-law</b> <b>PCM</b> (Europe {{and most of the}} rest of the world). These are logarithmic compression systems where a 12 or 13-bit linear PCM sample number is mapped into an 8-bit value. This system is described by international standard G.711. An alternative proposal for a floating point representation, with 5-bit mantissa and 3-bit exponent, was abandoned.|$|E

50|$|In addition, the {{standard}} specifies that all resulting even bits (LSB is even) are inverted before the octet is transmitted. This {{is to provide}} plenty of 0/1 transitions to facilitate the clock recovery process in the PCM receivers. Thus, a silent <b>A-law</b> encoded <b>PCM</b> channel has the 8 bit samples coded 0xD5 instead of 0x80 in the octets.|$|R
50|$|The speech encoder accepts 13 bit linear PCM at an 8 kHz sample rate.This can be {{direct from}} an analog-to-digital {{converter}} {{in a phone}} or computer, or converted from G.711 8-bit nonlinear <b>A-law</b> or μ-law <b>PCM</b> from the PSTN with a lookup table.In GSM, the encoded speech is passed to the channel encoder specified in GSM 05.03. In the receive direction, the inverse operations take place.|$|R
