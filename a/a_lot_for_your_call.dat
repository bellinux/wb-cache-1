500|$|Nash was {{slower and}} more portly {{than he was}} in the 1930s, short of match {{practice}} and forced to spend most Sundays in hospital having fluid drained from his injured knees swollen from the exertions of the day before, forcing South Melbourne coach Bull Adams to nurse Nash through the season. Additionally, in the Round 5 match against Footscray, he tore the webbing between his fingers which later became infected, causing him to miss the Round 6 match against North Melbourne and although Nash wore a special leather glove to protect his hand, the injury would trouble him {{for the rest of the}} season. Despite these setbacks, Nash could still be a match winner and many opposition players saw him as the key player for South Melbourne. Nash's best return for the year was seven goals against St Kilda in Round 12 and he twice kicked six goals in a match; against Geelong in Round 15 and Fitzroy in Round 18. When an opposition player did well against Nash, it was something to savour; years later leading Richmond player Don [...] "Mopsy" [...] Fraser wrote [...] "Trouncing Nash does <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> confidence, even <b>an</b> ageing Nash." ...|$|R

5000|$|Ahriman's Prophecy was {{received}} well by the gaming community. Edward Zuk of Game Tunnel opined that [...] "while Ahriman's Prophecy adds little that {{is new to}} the RPG genre, it's a pleasing mix of familiar elements."

GameSpy rated Hinterland 3.5 out of 5 ("Good"), citing positives such as the low price, low time investment, and random map generation while deriding it for low-quality animation, simplistic city-building, and low amount of feedback from various in-game events. [...] The IGN review praised the successful interweaving of the city management and adventuring aspects, while pointing out negatives including a clumsy interface and some minor technical problems. IGN concluded, [...] "For $20 USD, it's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of game <b>for</b> <b>your</b> dollar", earning it a score of 7.2 out of 10 (Decent).|$|R

[...] Writing for GameSpot, Kevin VanOrd felt that the character of Kasumi is not interesting and that the mission is too short for her character development compared to the squad members of the base game.

5000|$|In a more {{detailed}} review in January 1982, BYTE called the IBM PC [...] "a synthesis of the best the microcomputer industry has offered to date ... as well designed on the inside {{as it is on}} the outside". The magazine praised the keyboard as [...] "bar none, the best ... on any microcomputer", describing the unusual Shift key locations as [...] "minor problems compared to some of the gigantic mistakes made on almost every other microcomputer keyboard". The review also complimented IBM's manuals, which it predicted [...] "will set the standard for all microcomputer documentation in the future. Not only are they well packaged, well organized, and easy to understand, but they are also complete". Observing that detailed technical information was available [...] "much earlier ... than it has been for other machines", the magazine predicted that [...] "given a reasonable period of time, plenty of hardware and software will probably be developed for" [...] the computer. The review stated that although the IBM PC cost more than comparably configured Apple II and TRS-80 computers, and the insufficient number of slots for all desirable expansion cards was its most serious weakness, [...] "you get <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more <b>for</b> <b>your</b> money" [...] and concluded, [...] "In two years or so, I think it {{will be one of the}} most popular and best-supported ...

[...] Paul Haggis, who was labeled [...] "doughy" [...] and [...] "pasty" [...] by the church, likewise felt that the attacks were backfiring: [...] "You don't think that makes you look really bad trying to slander me in that way? I'm an imperfect human being. And I've made many, many mistakes in my life. So you can absolutely publicize any of those. But this, really, (you’re) thinking that makes you look good?" ...|$|R

40|$|First of all, I {{would like}} to warmly thank Sébastien Ourselin. Back in 2007, he {{accepted}} me for doing a PhD in his lab (e-Health Research Centre, Brisbane, Australia) and {{gave me the opportunity}} to work on state-of-the-art topics like GPGPU programming for instance. He also thought that developing a fast shell-based finite element model for soft tissues would make a great PhD topic. And after the completion of my PhD, I must say that he was right. So thanks <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> Seb <b>for</b> all <b>your</b> help and support during the 9 months we worked together and even beyond. Thank you as well for all the good wines you brought at each BBQ we did in Brisbane. And yes, Australians can be proud of their wine. Last but not least, thanks for not doing anything to compromise the success of my PhD once you were at UCL. I very much appreciated this and I will not forget it. Merci pour tout Seb. I would now like to express my deep and sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Stéphane Cotin. I greatly appreciated to work with you during these three years.

40|$|YES – it is {{with great}} {{pleasure}} that I can announce that we in 2010 we will definitely have 3 issues as I have received enough manuscripts already now to fill issue 2. The manuscripts are in different stages from being with the reviewers, or with the authors for revision or with the persons translating the abstracts into Spanish and French. You will notice {{that in some cases}} we have an additional abstract in a local language. Please feel free to submit one in case you think it will help otter conservation and awareness in your country. As you will have realized we have an increasing number of manuscripts from South America and Asia. This reflects the good work done by the senior scientists on the two continents that inspires many young students to elaborate their own research projects. It is with excitement that Lesley and I are awaiting the decision of Thompson ISI on whether the IUCN OSG Bull. will be assigned an impact factor. The pending decision is due to be announced sometime in June to us. It would be a great step ahead. However, if this is not happening yet we will keep up the work and apply in three years again. Lesley is putting an incredible amount of work into the Bulletin and the homepage of OSG. Lesley is not only updating regularly the website, is uploading articles on short term once the final versions become available, but finds in addition the time take care on the websites for Furget-Me-Not, Giant Otter Research and Otter Joy. Thanks <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> Lesley! <b>For</b> all <b>your</b> time and your efforts! We all regret {{not to be able to}} have the XIth Otter Colloquium later this year in Italy, to discuss all aspects of otter related science and conservation and to meet old friends again.
