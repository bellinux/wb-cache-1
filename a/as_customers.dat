5|$|Georg Emil Hansen (1833–1891) from Næstved {{came from}} a family of photographers. When his father, Carl Christian Hansen, opened a studio in Copenhagen, he decided to open one of his own. He {{became one of the most}} {{respected}} photographers of his day, with Christian IX of Denmark and the Danish Royal Family <b>as</b> <b>customers</b> in the early 1860s. He also excelled in adopting new techniques. He was the first to use paper prints and to make full-length portrait enlargements. He received awards for his exhibitions in London (1862) and Berlin (1865). In 1867, together with his brother, Niels Christian Hansen, and two other photographers, he set up a photographic firm which later became Hansen, Schou & Weller, suppliers to the royal Danish court.|$|E

5|$|A {{different}} approach to resolve the problems of range anxiety and lack of recharging infrastructure for electric vehicles was developed by Better Place. Its business model considers that electric cars are built and sold separately from the battery pack. <b>As</b> <b>customers</b> {{are not allowed to}} purchase battery packs, they must lease them from Better Place which will deploy a network of battery swapping stations thus expanding EVs range and allowing long distance trips. Subscribed users pay a per-distance fee to cover battery pack leasing, charging and swap infrastructure, the cost of sustainable electricity, and other costs. Better Place signed agreement for deployment in Australia, Denmark, Israel, Canada, California, and Hawaii. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the electric car built with switchable battery technology sold for the Better Place network. The robotic battery-switching operation was completed in about five minutes.|$|E
5|$|Rohrer {{launched}} the Kickstarter campaign on May 9, 2012, looking to raise $78,715; the campaign closed on May 26, 2012, after raising $90,118 from 1,305 backers. This allowed manufacturing to proceed, and Diamond Trust of London {{became the first}} successfully crowdfunded Nintendo DS game. By mid-July, the 6,000 cartridges had been manufactured by Nintendo in Japan, and in August, they arrived at Rohrer's home in California. As he was packaging the cartridges personally, it allowed him to release a special signed and numbered limited edition of 1000 copies, bundled with mystery bonuses. The game was released on August 28, 2012, and <b>as</b> <b>customers</b> received their copies, they revealed {{the contents of the}} limited edition. Jason Cipriano at MTV Multiplayer received, alongside his limited edition, postage stamps and a coin from countries featured in the game, and four actual diamonds.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{combined}} restaurants and stores owned by Cracker Barrel increased between 1997 and 2000, {{to more than}} 420 locations. In 2000 and 2001, the company addressed staffing and infrastructure issues related to this rapid growth by implementing a more rigorous recruitment strategy and introducing new technology, including an order-placement system. From the late 1990s to the mid-2000s, the company focused on opening new locations in residential areas to attract local residents and workers <b>as</b> <b>customers.</b> It updated its marketing in 2006 to encourage new customers, changing the design of its highway billboard advertisements to include images of menu items. Previously the signs had featured only the company's logo. By 2011, Cracker Barrel had opened more than 600 restaurants in 42 states. On January 17, 2012, company founder Dan Evins died of bladder cancer.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{posits that}} the ‘student as customer’ model has a {{negative}} impact upon the academic leadership {{which in turn is}} responsible for the erosion of objectivity in the assessment process in the higher education sector. The paper draws on the existing literature to explore the relationship between the student <b>as</b> <b>customer</b> model, academic leadership, and student assessment. The existing research emanating from the literature provides the basis from which the short comings of the student <b>as</b> <b>customer</b> model are exposed. From a practical perspective the arguments made in this paper provide the groundwork for possible future research into the adverse affects of the student <b>as</b> <b>customer</b> model on academic leadership and job satisfaction in the academic work force. The concern for quality may benefit from empirical investigation {{of the relationship between the}} student <b>as</b> <b>customer</b> model and quality learning and assessment outcomes in the higher education sector. The paper raises awareness of the faults with the present reliance on the student <b>as</b> <b>customer</b> model and the negative impact on both students and academic staff. The issues explored have the potential to influence the future directions of the higher education sector with regard to the social implications of their quest for quality educational outcomes. The paper addresses a gap in the literature in regard to use of the student <b>as</b> <b>customer</b> model and the subsequent adverse affect on academic leadership and assessment in higher education...|$|R

25|$|The {{success of}} Apple's lower-cost {{consumer}} models, especially the LC, {{also led to}} cannibalization of their higher priced machines. To address this, management introduced several new brands, selling largely identical machines at different price points aimed at different markets. These were the high-end Quadra, the mid-range Centris line, and the ill-fated Performa series. This led to significant market confusion, <b>as</b> <b>customers</b> {{did not understand the}} difference between models.|$|E

25|$|Multi-sided {{platforms}} exist {{because there}} is a need of intermediary in order to match both parts of the platform in a more efficient way. Indeed, this intermediary will minimize the overall cost, for instance, by avoiding duplication, or by minimizing transaction costs. This intermediary will make possible exchanges that would not occur without them and create value for both sides. Two-sided platforms, by playing an intermediary role, produce certain value for both users (parties) that are interconnected through it, and therefore those sides (parties) may both be evaluated <b>as</b> <b>customers</b> (unlike in the traditional seller-buyer dichotomy).|$|E
25|$|The {{financial}} problems were cause {{by a lack}} of focus on single market segments. ND had bought several software and hardware companies without a defined strategy, and often without adding new segments to the portfolio, as they often had overlapping products. The purchases were made in the hope that new software would bring new clients to choose ND hardware, which was the only product ND made profits from. Rolf Skår stated in 1988 that the company should focus on the banking industry, but this was never carried out. Sales had continued to fall during 1989, <b>as</b> <b>customers</b> were concerned that the Sintran-based product line would be discontinued.|$|E

25|$|Task Review: Alpha quickly {{decided to}} set up their seafood stand in Islington, but had {{difficulty}} in identifying seafood and correctly pricing them, <b>as</b> <b>customers</b> bombarded their stand before they had even begun. Despite this, the team performed well and managed to sell large orders to groups of people. Meanwhile, Renaissance performed poorly on the task; while they also set up in Islington, the team didn't start until midday and struggled to identify the seafood, with Nicholas pricing some of the item at much cheaper values than they were. In addition, the team sold their lobsters for {{much less than the}} recommended retail price, while Michael panic-sold £100 of fish for less than half its value, with their mistakes ultimately costing them victory.|$|E

In September, A announced it was selling seven Connecticut stores to Big Y. On December 10, 2010, bankruptcy rumors surfaced; A stock tumbled from over $3 per share to below $1 before trading was halted. Two days later, A announced it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. According to documents submitted to U.S. Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, New York, A listed over $2.5 billion in assets, and $3.2 billion in debt.|$|E
25|$|Management {{announced}} on 24 January 1989 a major {{restructuring of the}} company. The development division would be reduced from several hundred to {{less than a hundred}} employees, there would be large down-scaling in the foreign sales offices and the development of Unix-based systems would be spun off in Dolphin Server Technology. ND would not develop its own hardware any more, but purchase components from third parties, including Dolphin. At a public meeting, Skår responded to a question by stating that Notis would be replaced with new systems. Development of Notis was spun off in its own company, Notis AS, which continued to develop the program for ND. Sales fell dramatically <b>as</b> <b>customers</b> lost confidence in that ND could deliver the products in the future and by the internal process demotivating the sales employees. Only in Germany did sales not decrease during 1988 and 1989.|$|E
