5|$|Al-Qaeda under Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's {{leadership}} launched coordinated {{explosions in}} three hotel lobbies in Amman on 9 November 2005, resulting in 60 deaths and 115 injured. The bombings, which targeted civilians, caused widespread outrage among Jordanians. The attack {{is considered to}} be a rare event in the country, and Jordan's internal security was dramatically improved afterwards. No major terrorist <b>attacks</b> <b>have</b> occurred since then. Abdullah and Jordan are viewed with contempt by Islamic extremists for the country's peace treaty with Israel and its relationship with the West.|$|E
5|$|Elephants can exhibit {{bouts of}} {{aggressive}} behaviour {{and engage in}} destructive actions against humans. In Africa, groups of adolescent elephants damaged homes in villages after cullings in the 1970s and 1980s. Because of the timing, these <b>attacks</b> <b>have</b> been interpreted as vindictive. In parts of India, male elephants regularly enter villages at night, destroying homes and killing people. Elephants killed around 300 people between 2000 and 2004 in Jharkhand while in Assam, 239 people were reportedly killed between 2001 and 2006.|$|E

5000|$|The attack {{took place}} {{at a time when}} {{terrorist}} <b>attacks</b> <b>had</b> declined and casualties were rare since the few recent <b>attacks</b> <b>had</b> been planned by untrained [...] "Lone wolves," [...] who planned poorly and were not heavily armed with guns or explosives.|$|R

50|$|Initial Moroccan <b>attacks</b> <b>had</b> been {{generally}} successful. In {{the space of}} a fortnight, the Moroccans and their tribal allies had asserted control over most of Ifni, isolating inland Spanish units from the capital. Simultaneous <b>attacks</b> <b>had</b> been launched throughout Spanish Sahara, overrunning garrisons and ambushing convoys and patrols.|$|R
5|$|A month later, Samus awakens {{aboard a}} Galactic Federation starship, where she learns that Dark Samus's Phazon-based <b>attacks</b> <b>have</b> {{corrupted}} her. The Federation equips her {{suit with a}} Phazon Enhancement Device (PED) that enables her to harness the Phazon energy within herself. She is informed that her fellow bounty hunters, also corrupted with Phazon and equipped with PEDs, have gone missing during their missions to investigate several planets embedded with Leviathan Seeds. Samus is first sent to the planet Bryyo and later Elysia to determine {{what happened to her}} missing comrades. She soon discovers that both planets and their inhabitants are slowly being corrupted by the Leviathan Seeds; and that she must destroy the seeds to reverse this.|$|E
5|$|Beetle remains bearing what {{appeared}} to be the marks of bird <b>attacks</b> <b>have</b> been found by the River Ouse and hardened adults often bear symmetrically indented elytra, interpreted as 'pinch marks' inflicted by a beak whilst newly emerged adults are still hardening. Dead beetles have also been found in the webs of spiders in a captive population. The accidental predation of C. graminis by livestock consuming the tansy plant is also possible. Predation of a larva by the scorpionfly Panorpa germanica has been observed in the field. The tachinid genus Macquartia exclusively parasitizes Chrysolmelid beetles and one species of which, Macquartia dispar, may parasitise C. graminis directly. The adult fly deposits fully incubated eggs or newly hatched larvae into the vicinity of the host larvae.|$|E
5|$|Each enemy has a meter, {{called a}} Chain Gauge, {{consisting}} of a percentage that increases from a base level of 100 when the enemy is struck by attacks or spells. Different <b>attacks</b> <b>have</b> different effects; some raise the chain by a larger amount while others give the player longer before the Chain Gauge resets to 100 percent. The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by the chain percentage before it {{is applied to the}} enemy. When the chain counter reaches a preset amount, different for each enemy, the enemy becomes Staggered. In this mode, the enemy has lowered defense and is easily interrupted, and some may even be launched into the air, preventing them from attacking and stopping their ATB gauges from replenishing.|$|E
50|$|The {{failure of}} the <b>attack</b> <b>had</b> been {{anticipated}} shortly before the <b>attack</b> <b>had</b> even been launched. The Iraqi defences in the area were too strong. However, the <b>attack</b> <b>had</b> succeeded in drawing away men of the Iraqi army from other sectors, including the area defending the Iranian's ultimate prize, Basra. On the 14th, Operation Khaibar succeeded in capturing Majnoon Island, 40 miles from Basra. The attack was contained through an Iraqi counter-attack with Iraqi reserves, employed {{in tandem with the}} use of chemical weapons (mustard gas and sarin gas).|$|R

5|$|Encrypting {{ransomware}} {{returned to}} prominence in late 2013 with {{the propagation of}} CryptoLocker—using the Bitcoin digital currency platform to collect ransom money. In December 2013, ZDNet estimated based on Bitcoin transaction information that between 15 October and 18 December, the operators of CryptoLocker had procured about US$27 million from infected users. The CryptoLocker technique was widely copied in the months following, including CryptoLocker 2.0 (though not {{to be related to}} CryptoLocker), CryptoDefense (which initially contained a major design flaw that stored the private key on the infected system in a user-retrievable location, due to its use of Windows' built-in encryption APIs), and the August 2014 discovery of a Trojan specifically targeting network-attached storage devices produced by Synology. In January 2015, it was reported that ransomware-styled <b>attacks</b> <b>have</b> occurred against individual websites via hacking, and through ransomware designed to target Linux-based web servers.|$|E
5|$|Most historians {{share the}} view that the militants {{escalated}} the conflict toward violence on the basis of false information transmitted by duplicitous individuals or groups attempting to neutralize the nationalist influence. Members of VVS and Jiny involved in the initial <b>attacks</b> <b>have</b> stated that their organizations were obliged to attack after the signal to take action was transmitted to them by a group that was later discovered to have secret ties to the national police. Researchers have documented reports of nationalists whose member organizations joined the conflict upon commands issued by the police, British nationals, and French settlers living in Madagascar. Despite the role of the militants in leading the uprising, the colonial authorities immediately held MDRM responsible for the movement and responded by targeting the party's members and supporters.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August, the Jewish Community Centre in Palmotićeva Street in Zagreb, and Jewish graves at the Mirogoj Cemetery, were bombed {{as a part}} of Operation Labrador. The explosions caused {{property}} damage, but {{resulted in}} no casualties. There were no public claims of responsibility for the attack. Aside from the two explosions in Zagreb, agents assigned to Operation Labrador were thought to also be responsible for bombing the Zagreb–Belgrade railway near Vinkovci and a railway line between Glina and Vojnić. The railway <b>attacks</b> <b>have</b> also been ascribed to Operation Opera.|$|E

5|$|Man-eaters {{have been}} a {{particular}} problem in recent decades in India and Bangladesh, especially in Kumaon, Garhwal and the Sundarbans mangrove swamps of Bengal, where some healthy tigers have hunted humans. Because of rapid habitat loss attributed to climate change, tiger <b>attacks</b> <b>have</b> increased in the Sundarbans. The Sundarbans area had 129 human deaths from tigers from 1969 to 1971. In the 10 years prior to that period, about 100 attacks {{per year in the}} Sundarbans, with a high of around 430 in some years of the 1960s. Unusually, in some years in the Sundarbans, more humans are killed by tigers than vice versa. In 1972, India's production of honey and beeswax dropped by 50% when at least 29 people who gathered these materials were devoured. In 1986 in the Sundarbans, since tigers almost always attack from the rear, masks with human faces were worn {{on the back of the}} head, on the theory that tigers usually do not attack if seen by their prey. This decreased the number of attacks only temporarily. All other means to prevent attacks, such as providing more prey or using electrified human dummies, worked less well.|$|E

25|$|Intrusion {{prevention}} systems (IPS) {{are effective}} if the <b>attacks</b> <b>have</b> signatures associated with them.
