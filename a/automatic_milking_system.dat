It is, however, not known whether using sensor systems also improves production, health, reproduction and economic {{performance of the}} farm. The first objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the effect of sensor systems on milk production, days to first service and somatic cell count of the herd. The second objective is to investigate the impact of investment in sensor systems on several cost components and revenues. Data on production, health and reproduction over the years 2003 - 2013 was available for 414 Dutch dairy farms with sensor systems on an <b>automatic</b> <b>milking</b> <b>system</b> (n= 103), with sensor systems on a conventional milking system (n= 49) and without (n= 262) sensor systems. In addition, farm accounting data of 217 dairy farms with sensor systems on an <b>automatic</b> <b>milking</b> <b>system</b> (n= 54), with sensor systems on a conventional milking system (n= 36) and without (n= 127) sensor systems was available for the years 2008 - 2013. Having sensor systems was associated with a higher average production per cow on farms with an <b>automatic</b> <b>milking</b> <b>system,</b> and with a lower average production per cow on farms with a conventional milking system in the years after investment. Farms with an <b>automatic</b> <b>milking</b> <b>system</b> had on average 12, 000 cells/ml higher somatic cell count after adoption of the sensor system whereas farms with a conventional milking system had on average 10, 000 cells/ml lower somatic cell count.

The milking frequency of multiparous cows was observed to be almost constant during the entire lactation, on average 2. 5 times per day. However, first-lactating cows increase the milking frequency from the beginning (2. 3 times per day) to the end of lactation (2. 9 times per day), when the lactation is divided into three periods of 100 days each.

40|$|Since {{the first}} {{commercial}} systems appeared in 1992, <b>automatic</b> <b>milking</b> <b>systems</b> (AM-systems) have been installed at an increasing rate. No other new technology since {{the introduction of the}} milking machine, has aroused so much interest and expectations among dairy farmers and the periphery. Reduced labour, a better social life for dairy farm families and increased milk yields due to more frequent milking are recognised as important benefits of <b>automatic</b> <b>milking.</b> <b>Automatic</b> <b>milking</b> changes many aspects of farm management since both the nature and organisation of labour is altered. Manual labour is partly replaced by management and control, and the presence of the operator at regular milking times is no longer required. Visual control on cow and udder health at milking is, at least partly, taken over by automatic systems. Facilities for teat cleaning and separation of abnormal milk are incorporated into the automatic system and several adaptations are needed to accommodate continuous milking. Cow management including routing within the barn, the opportunity for grazing and the use of total mixed rations is altered. A high level of management and realistic expectations are essential to successful adoption of <b>automatic</b> <b>milking.</b> Results from commercial farms indicate, that milk quality is somewhat negatively effected, although bacterial counts and somatic cell counts remain well below penalty levels. In terms of quality control, AM-systems offer extra means to assure milk quality and food safety. No adverse effects of the transition have been found for body condition, lameness or teat condition. A potential risk is that fertility of the herd may decline faster than the current trend for conventional dairy farms. The only obvious change was that milk cell count, often an indicator of the prevalence of mastitis, increased overall. <b>Automatic</b> <b>milking</b> <b>systems</b> require a higher investment than conventional <b>milking</b> <b>systems.</b> However increased <b>milk</b> yields and reduced labour requirements may lead to a decrease in the fixed costs per kg <b>milk.</b> <b>Automatic</b> <b>milking</b> is gaining widespread acceptance and is estimated to be in use on more than 2500 farms in over 20 countries worldwide...|$|R

Therefore, this study explored whether decision-tree induction was able to predict the Gram-status of CM causal pathogens using in-line sensor measurements from <b>automatic</b> <b>milking</b> <b>systems.</b> Data were collected at nine Dutch dairy farms <b>milking</b> with <b>automatic</b> <b>milking</b> <b>systems</b> and included 140 bacteriological cultured CM cases with sensor measurements of electrical conductivity, colors red, green, and blue and milk yield for analyses. In total, 110 CM cases were classified as Gram-positive CM cases and 30 as Gram-negative. Stratified randomization was used to divide the data in a training set (n = 96) for model development, and a test set (n = 44) for validation. The decision tree used three variables to predict the Gram-status of the CM causal pathogen; two variables were based on electrical conductivity measurements, and one on measurements of the color blue. This decision tree had an accuracy of 90. 6 % and a kappa value of 0. 76 based on data in the training set. When only those CM cases were considered with extreme high probability estimates for their Gram-status (either positive or negative), 74 % of all records in the training set could be classified with a stratified accuracy of 97. 1 %. When validated, the decision tree performed poorly; accuracy dropped to 54. 5 % and the kappa value to - 0. 20. The stratified accuracy calculated for 75 % of all records in the test set was 66. 7 %. Predicting the CM causal pathogen showed a similar poor result; the decision tree had an accuracy of 27. 9 % and a kappa of 0. 12, based on data in the test set. Based on these results, it is concluded that decision-tree induction in conjunction with sensor information from the electrical conductivity, color, and milk yield provide insufficient discriminative power to predict the Gram-status or the CM causal pathogen itself.

Automaattilypsyn käyttöönoton jälkeen somaattisten solujen, kokonaisbakteerien, psykrotrofisten ja koliformisten bakteerien määrät olivat korkeampia kuin perinteisesti lypsettäessä, mutta erot eivät olleet tilastollisesti merkitseviä. Klostridi-itiöiden määrä oli samalla tasolla automaattilypsymaidossa ja perinteisesti lypsetyssä maidossa. Bacillus cereuksen määrä oli hyvin alhainen molemmilla lypsytavoilla. Maidon rasvapitoisuus ja vapaiden rasvahappojen määrä kohosivat automaattisen lypsyn käyttöönoton jälkeen. Jäätymispiste kohosi ensimmäisten kolmen kuukauden kuluessa laitteiston käyttöönotosta. Vaikka maidon laatu heikkeni, se oli edelleen Eluokan maitoa. When an <b>automatic</b> <b>milking</b> <b>system</b> (AMS) is {{introduced}} {{on a farm}} the milking of cows and related work is changed in many ways compared to farms with traditional milking systems. The objective {{of this paper was}} to study the effect of the introduction of robotic milking in Finland on the composition and hygienic quality of milk. The study was carried out on three farms which were the first in Finland to introduce the <b>automatic</b> <b>milking</b> <b>system</b> (Volontary Milking System). Main chemical composition, somatic cell count, total bacteria count, freezing point, free fatty acids, as well as Bacillus cereus, Clostridium spores, psychrotrophic bacteria and coliforms were determined. After the introduction of the <b>automatic</b> <b>milking</b> <b>system</b> an increase in somatic cell count and total bacteria count, psychrotrophic bacteria and coliforms was observed; however, the differences were not statistically significant. The counts for Clostridium spores were at the same level in the automatic and the conventional milking system. Bacillus cereus counts were very low in both milking systems studied. Milk fat content and free fatty acids were elevated when AMS was introduced. The introduction of AMS resulted in a significant increase (P < 0. 01) in the freezing point during the first three months. Though there was a trend that the overall quality of milk was impaired after the introduction of AMS, the quality of milk remained at premium class. v 2005 okAutomaattisen lypsylaitteiston käyttöönoton vaikutus maidon laatuu...|$|E
40|$|Danish {{researchers}} {{have investigated the}} possibilities to facilitate organic dairy farms with innovative technology and design, {{with the aim of}} improving grazing and grazing management (technology for grazing). Logistics, walking tracks, intelligent gates and individual behaviour sensors were investigated. Best practice examples with track coverage and practical experiments with new gates and accelerometers were implemented together with monitor farms and results described. Especially when using <b>automatic</b> <b>milking</b> <b>systems,</b> gates can be of help when distributing the animals among paddocks. Registration of grazing time by accelerometers can be used as decision support for dosage of supplementary feeding. Wireless contact and automatic logging of contact data from RFID ear-tags gave information on outside time, which can be used in herd management. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>automatic</b> <b>milking</b> <b>systems</b> (AMS) on dairy farms has increased significantly worldwide {{since the last}} millennium. For organic farms in Germay, {{the use of this}} technique is increasingly interesting, as organic dairy farms often have herd sizes between 50 and 150 cows which suit best for <b>automatic</b> <b>milking</b> <b>systems.</b> The implementation of AMS does not only bring along changes in terms of the milking process, but also affects the entire housing system, management and feeding. AMS is often connected with a restriction of pasturing and indirectly the risk of lame cows may increase. The aim {{of this study was to}} clarify whether the use of AMS is compatible with animal welfare in organic dairy farming, paying particular attention to impacts on pasture use. In an online survey, 42 organic dairy farmers with AMS have been asked for their feeding and pasture system before and after AMS implementation on their farms. The results of the survey showed that the herd size had partially grown significantly since the introduction of the AMS. The herd growth led to a significant decrease in the average grazing area per cow on the farms with pasture use. In addition, total area used as pasture decreased on the majority of the farms. Some farms had even completely ceased pasture use. Summarized, the impact of the AMS on animal welfare depends significantly on the housing conditions and the management of the farmers. In organic dairy farming, impairments of animal health and welfare by AMS have to be avoided. Especially the implementation of AMS should not be connected with ceasing grazing for cattle. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{option for}} {{combining}} grazing and <b>automatic</b> <b>milking</b> is Infield <b>Automatic</b> <b>Milking,</b> with {{more or less}} mobile infield <b>automatic</b> <b>milking</b> <b>systems</b> (IAMS), which have been practiced since 2008 in several European countries. This emerging technology {{can be used to}} harvest milk from specific areas, giving specialized dairies the possibility to market concept milk, cheese or butter. Terroir dairy can be a new way to increase marginal product value and thereby farm income. Three different options are described; i) the IAMS placed on a stationary platform in the field, ii) movable together with facilities necessary for the functionality from field to field, iii) as a self propelled moving unit that changes positions in the field every day, requiring transportation of the milk to the field border. All systems could guarantee dairy products based on maximum grazing for the period the pasture can provide sufficient feeding. Batch size depends on the dairies minimum process volume for the specific products, local conditions will be decisive for the amount of days needed for pooling before production. Peer reviewe...|$|R
