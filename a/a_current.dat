5|$|Because {{the balance}} of {{payments}} sums to zero, <b>a</b> <b>current</b> account surplus indicates a deficit in the asset accounts and vice versa. <b>A</b> <b>current</b> account surplus or deficit indicates {{the extent to which}} a country is relying on foreign capital to finance its consumption and investments, and whether it is living beyond its means. For example, assuming a capital account balance of zero (thus no asset transfers available for financing), <b>a</b> <b>current</b> account deficit of £1 billion implies a financial account surplus (or net asset exports) of £1 billion. A net exporter of financial assets is known as a borrower, exchanging future payments for current consumption. Further, a net export of financial assets indicates growth in a country's debt. From this perspective, {{the balance of}} payments links a nation's income to its spending by indicating the degree to which current account imbalances are financed with domestic or foreign financial capital, which illuminates how a nation's wealth is shaped over time. A healthy balance of payments position is important for economic growth. If countries experiencing a growth in demand have trouble sustaining a healthy balance of payments, demand can slow, leading to: unused or excess supply, discouraged foreign investment, and less attractive exports which can further reinforce a negative cycle that intensifies payments imbalances.|$|E

50|$|Optical {{rectification}} {{is analogous}} to the electric rectification effect produced by diodes, wherein an AC signal can be converted ("rectified") to DC. However, it is not the same thing. A diode can turn a sinusoidal electric field into <b>a</b> DC <b>current,</b> while optical rectification can turn a sinusoidal electric field into a DC polarization, but not <b>a</b> DC <b>current.</b> On the other hand, a changing polarization is <b>a</b> kind of <b>current.</b> Therefore, if the incident light is getting more and more intense, optical rectification causes <b>a</b> DC <b>current,</b> while if the light is getting less and less intense, optical rectification causes <b>a</b> DC <b>current</b> in the opposite direction. But again, if the light intensity is constant, optical rectification cannot cause <b>a</b> DC <b>current.</b>|$|R

In contrast, when the plate has a negative voltage with respect to the filament, the electrons are not attracted to it and no current {{flows through the}} tube (unlike the filament, the plate does not emit electrons). <b>As</b> <b>current</b> can pass through the valve in one direction only, it therefore [...] "rectifies" [...] <b>an</b> AC <b>current</b> to <b>a</b> pulsing DC <b>current.</b>|$|R
