25|$|<b>As</b> <b>thunderstorms</b> fill into <b>a</b> {{distinct}} line, strong leading-edge updrafts – occasionally {{visible to}} a ground observer {{in the form}} of a shelf cloud – may appear as an ominous sign of potential severe weather.|$|R
25|$|Shelf {{clouds and}} roll clouds are usually seen above {{the leading edge}} of a squall, also known as <b>a</b> <b>thunderstorm's</b> gust front. From the time these low cloud {{features}} appear in the sky, one can expect a sudden increase in the wind in less than 15 minutes.|$|R
50|$|Cumulonimbus clouds can be powerful. If {{the correct}} {{atmospheric}} conditions are met, they can {{grow into a}} supercell storm. This cloud may be <b>a</b> single-cell <b>thunderstorm</b> or one cell in <b>a</b> multicellular <b>thunderstorm.</b> They are capable of producing severe storm conditions for {{a short amount of}} time.|$|R

5|$|Preparedness {{refers to}} {{precautions}} {{that should be}} taken before <b>a</b> <b>thunderstorm.</b> Some preparedness {{takes the form of}} general readiness (as <b>a</b> <b>thunderstorm</b> can occur at any time of the day or year). Preparing a family emergency plan, for example, can save valuable time if a storm arises quickly and unexpectedly. Preparing the home by removing dead or rotting limbs and trees, which can be blown over in high winds, can also significantly reduce the risk of property damage and personal injury.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette spoke {{publicly}} {{for the last}} time in the Chamber of Deputies on 3 January 1834. The next month, he collapsed at a funeral from pneumonia. Although he recovered, the following May was wet and, after being caught in <b>a</b> <b>thunderstorm,</b> he became bedridden.|$|E

5|$|Most {{thunderstorms}} {{come and}} go fairly uneventfully; however, any thunderstorm can become severe, and all thunderstorms, by definition, present the danger of lightning. Thunderstorm preparedness and safety refers to taking steps before, during, and after <b>a</b> <b>thunderstorm</b> to minimize injury and damage.|$|E
5|$|The WSF Street Fair {{took place}} in and around Washington Square Park, on the New York University campus, on Saturday, May 30, 2008. Although it was {{interrupted}} by <b>a</b> <b>thunderstorm,</b> the street fair was attended by 100,000 people, according to estimates from the New York Police Department.|$|E
5|$|The bounded weak echo region, {{also known}} as a BWER or a vault, is a radar {{signature}} within <b>a</b> <b>thunderstorm</b> characterized by a local minimum in radar reflectivity at low levels which extends upward into, and is surrounded by, higher reflectivities aloft. This feature is associated with a strong updraft and is almost always found in the inflow region of <b>a</b> <b>thunderstorm.</b> It cannot be seen visually. The BWER has been noted on radar imagery of severe thunderstorms since 1973 and has a lightning detection system equivalent known as a lightning hole.|$|E
50|$|A watch {{does not}} {{necessarily}} mean that severe weather is actually occurring, only that atmospheric conditions have created a significant risk for severe weather to occur. If severe weather actually does occur, <b>a</b> severe <b>thunderstorm</b> warning or tornado warning will be issued, and urgent action should be taken immediately. While <b>a</b> severe <b>thunderstorm</b> watch does not imply in its name the risk for tornadoes, the risk for tornadoes in such a scenario is not necessarily zero as severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do spawn tornadoes even after only <b>a</b> severe <b>thunderstorm</b> watch has been issued.|$|R

500|$|Pressure {{perturbations}} around thunderstorms are noteworthy. With buoyancy rapid {{within the}} lower and mid-levels of <b>a</b> mature <b>thunderstorm,</b> updraft and downdraft create distinct mesocenters of pressure. <b>As</b> <b>thunderstorms</b> organized in squall lines, {{the northern end}} of the squall line is commonly referred to as the cyclonic end, with the southern side rotating anticyclonically (in Northern hemisphere). Because of the coriolis force, the northern end may evolve further, creating a [...] "comma shaped" [...] wake low, or may continue in a squall-like pattern. The updraft ahead of the line create a mesolow too while the downdraft just behind the line will produce a mesohigh.|$|R
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were scheduled, two 1.5-hour sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. However, with treacherous weather conditions including flood warnings, the second practice session was cancelled due to heavy rain and <b>a</b> <b>thunderstorm.</b> The other two practice session were run in wet conditions.|$|E
5|$|Since many tornadoes are audible {{only when}} very near, sound {{is not to}} be thought of as a {{reliable}} warning signal for a tornado. Tornadoes are also not the only source of such sounds in severe thunderstorms; any strong, damaging wind, a severe hail volley, or continuous thunder in <b>a</b> <b>thunderstorm</b> may produce a roaring sound.|$|E
5|$|Thunderstorm asthma is the {{triggering}} of an asthma {{attack by}} environmental conditions directly {{caused by a}} local thunderstorm. During <b>a</b> <b>thunderstorm,</b> pollen grains can absorb moisture and then burst into much smaller fragments with these fragments being easily dispersed by wind. While larger pollen grains are usually filtered by hairs in the nose, the smaller pollen fragments are able to pass through and enter the lungs, triggering the asthma attack.|$|E

5|$|At {{the village}} of Kusić in Banat, a man named Ilija Bordan was {{regarded}} to be alovit; the villagers talked {{that he had a}} tail. Whenever <b>a</b> <b>thunderstorm</b> came, his appearance changed—he fought with an ala. If the ala was overwhelming him, Ilija would lie down and sleep, and if he was overpowering her, the clouds would start to dissipate. There was a tale in the same village about an alovit man who would warn the villagers of the approach of <b>a</b> <b>thunderstorm,</b> before he took a wagon pole on his back and flew into the clouds. At {{the village of}} Sokolovac in Banat, people told of an alovit man who had four nipples. At the sight of hail clouds, he would mount his mare and disappear for several days. The latter two men would come back tired, bruised, and with torn clothes. As held in the central Serbian region of Gruža, men could become dragonlike. As such, they would suddenly disappear during thunderstorms, and fly into the dark clouds to fight against ale. They were characterized as nimble, hot-tempered, rash and very strong. At a village near Radomir in western Bulgaria, there was a dragon man who was said to have been physically crippled by an ala.|$|E
5|$|Between 4:45 and 5:00 pm, {{a number}} of people in the area of Winona, Minnesota, were observing <b>a</b> <b>thunderstorm</b> {{approaching}} from the northwest. These people told the Civil Aeronautics Board that the storm was increasing in intensity, and they observed increasing amounts of thunder and lightning. The aircraft continued on course in the direction of Winona, where it encountered the thunderstorm. The aircraft was seen flying below the clouds before entering the roll cloud, or leading edge of the thunderstorm. This was the last reported sighting of the aircraft; seconds later, local observers saw pieces of the aircraft falling from the sky.|$|E
5|$|Delayed by {{the late}} arrival of the York garrison, it was late evening before the Royalists were fully deployed. A flurry of rain showers and the discouragement of Newcastle and Eythin persuaded Rupert to delay his attack until the next day. From {{the ranks of the}} allied army he could hear the singing of psalms. As the Royalist troops broke ranks for their supper, Leven noted the lack of {{preparation}} among his opponents and ordered his men to attack at or shortly after 7:30pm, just as <b>a</b> <b>thunderstorm</b> broke out over the moor.|$|E
2500|$|Severe <b>Thunderstorm</b> Warning – <b>A</b> severe <b>thunderstorm</b> is {{indicated}} by Doppler weather radar or sighted by Skywarn spotters or other persons, such as local law enforcement. <b>A</b> severe <b>thunderstorm</b> contains large damaging hail of [...] in diameter or larger, and/or damaging winds of [...] or greater. These warnings are currently issued on a polygonal basis.|$|R

5|$|If the {{quantity}} of water that is condensed in and subsequently precipitated from a cloud is known, then the total energy of <b>a</b> <b>thunderstorm</b> can be calculated. In a typical thunderstorm, approximately 5×108 kg of water vapor are lifted, {{and the amount of}} energy released when this condenses is 1015 joules. This is on the same order of magnitude of energy released within a tropical cyclone, and more energy than that released during the atomic bomb blast at Hiroshima, Japan in 1945.|$|E
5|$|In 1574, Queen Elizabeth I {{promoted}} {{the restoration of}} the church, to serve as the grand parish church of Bath. She ordered that a national fund should be set up to finance the work, and in 1583 decreed that it should become the parish church of Bath. James Montague, the Bishop of Bath and Wells from 1608–1616, paid £1,000 for a new nave roof of timber lath construction; according to the inscription on his tomb, this was prompted after seeking shelter in the roofless nave during <b>a</b> <b>thunderstorm.</b> He is buried in an alabaster tomb in the north aisle.|$|E
5|$|Lightning is an {{electrical}} discharge {{that occurs in}} <b>a</b> <b>thunderstorm.</b> It {{can be seen in}} the form of a bright streak (or bolt) from the sky. Lightning occurs when {{an electrical}} charge is built up within a cloud, due to static electricity generated by supercooled water droplets colliding with ice crystals near the freezing level. When a large enough charge is built up, a large discharge will occur and can be seen as lightning.|$|E
