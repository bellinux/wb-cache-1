They fire at Mulder, hitting the boxes behind him and exposing him to the gas. The {{exposure}} causes Mulder to strip naked, hide in the box, and hallucinate <b>about</b> <b>seeing</b> aliens in the warehouse. Susanne shoots the men and escapes. More men then arrive, led by X, who intimidates the Lone Gunmen. Byers confronts X, asking him about his actions and mentioning the supposed cover-up of the John F. Kennedy assassination. X's unconvincing denial—"I heard it was a lone gunman"—becomes {{the origin of the}} trio's name. X leaves, just as the police arrive and arrest the Lone Gunmen.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea for}} a biopic of Grandin {{originated}} with its executive producer Emily Gerson Saines, a successful talent agent and a co-founder of the nonprofit Autism Coalition for Research and Education (now part of Autism Speaks). In the mid-1990s, Gerson Saines was a vice-president at the William Morris Agency when her 2-year-old son was diagnosed with autism.

25|$|In 1869, the twenty-three year-old Cody met Ned Buntline, {{who later}} {{published}} a story based on Cody's adventures (largely invented by the writer) in Street and Smith's New York Weekly and then published {{a highly successful}} novel, Buffalo Bill, King of the Bordermen, which was first serialized {{on the front page}} of the Chicago Tribune, beginning that December 15. Many other sequels followed by Buntline, Prentiss Ingraham and others from the 1870s through the early part of the twentieth century. Cody later became world-famous for Buffalo Bill's Wild West, a touring show which traveled around the United States, Great Britain and Europe. Audiences were enthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>seeing</b> a piece of the American West. Emilio Salgari, a noted Italian writer of adventure stories, met Buffalo Bill when he came to Italy and saw his show; Salgari later featured Cody as a hero in some of his novels.|$|E
25|$|Sir Rowland {{wonders if}} there is {{anything}} written on the autographed papers in invisible ink and they test them, revealing the names of six distributors of drugs, including Costello. Going to tell the police their findings, the sleeping Pippa is left alone and, after a moment, Jeremy re-enters and is about to smother the girl's face with a cushion when Clarissa comes back. She soon realises that he is the killer. He was away from the other two men for a time after they had gone to the club to eat and a remark Pippa made <b>about</b> <b>seeing</b> his golf club ("A golf stick like Jeremy had", {{in the context of the}} weapon used to kill Costello) ties in. He also rang the police to try to incriminate Clarissa. Jeremy confesses; his motive was the envelope that the autographed papers were kept in – on it is an extremely rare error stamp worth the fourteen thousand pounds. He is about to kill Clarissa when the police enter the room, having heard the exchange, and arrest him. They take him away. The others go to bed and Henry returns but without his diplomatic guests who have failed to turn up. Like the police inspector, he fails to believe a word his wife tells him of the evening's events...|$|E

Both Carey and Boyz II Men wrote the song about specific people in their lives, being inspired by sufferers of the AIDS epidemic, which was globally prevalent at that time.|$|E

Like Turner, protagonist of Gibson's Count Zero, characters in The Matrix download instructions (to fly a helicopter and to [...] "know kung fu", respectively) directly into their heads, and both Neuromancer and The Matrix feature artificial intelligences which strive to free themselves from human control. Critics have identified marked similarities between Neuromancer and the film's cinematography and tone. In spite of his initial reticence <b>about</b> <b>seeing</b> the film on its release, Gibson later described it as [...] "arguably the ultimate 'cyberpunk' artifact."

[...] The series is described as [...] "all about the [...] "moe" [...] factor, bringing about an atmosphere that makes you like the characters, care about them and feel good <b>about</b> <b>seeing</b> them interact. It does it well even if it doesn’t have an amazing hook." [...] For the second DVD volume, Beveridge commented that the series continues to be [...] "very predictable and bland" [...] which is [...] "at this point fun but entirely forgettable."

500|$|Christine Love {{describes}} herself as [...] "a writer first, and a game designer second", as writing was her initial goal. She originally pictured her future {{as that of a}} novelist, with a day job as a programmer to support herself. Love describes her games as being about [...] "our relationship with technology, about human relationships in general, and <b>about</b> <b>seeing</b> things from different perspectives," [...] as well as having [...] "a ton of words". She strives for her stories to be true and sincere, but not necessarily realistic. Love is also interested in the portrayal of gender and sexuality in video games; in Digital and Analogue, she was careful to avoid mentioning or assuming the gender of the player or the character they control, though the love interests in the games are female. Privately, however, she thinks of them as female, as her intention was to create games that could be easily appreciated by queer people such as herself, without having to project themselves onto a relationship that did not match up to their perceptions. Love believes that indie games have [...] "more meaningful depictions of queer experiences" [...] than those from larger studios.|$|E

Quinn then gives an ultimatum: if Finn wants their relationship to continue, he cannot sing any more duets with Rachel. Rachel has other ideas, and later sings [...] "Go Your Own Way" [...] to Finn, who accompanies her on the drums. Some sharp accusations are thrown before Sam bitterly reveals {{that he was at}} the motel because his parents are unemployed and his family lives there now that their house has been foreclosed on—Kurt was bringing Sam some clothes, and Quinn was helping Sam babysit his younger brother and sister. Sam storms out. When the club discovers from Quinn that Sam has pawned his guitar, they buy it back for him and offer their support. Sam brings his siblings to a glee club rehearsal, and everyone sings [...] "Don't Stop".|$|E
500|$|In {{the book}} and DVD set titled , author Laurence Rees {{indicates}} that although Gröning had requested to leave Auschwitz after he witnessed the killing, his objection was only {{on the basis of}} its practical implementation, and not on the general militaristic principle of the mass extermination of enemies. Gröning said that he thought at the time that it was justified due to all the Nazi propaganda he had been subjected to, in that Germany's enemies were being destroyed, which to him made the tools of their destruction (such as gas chambers) of no particular significance. Because of this, he says his feelings <b>about</b> <b>seeing</b> people and knowing that they had hours to live before being gassed were [...] "very ambiguous". He explains that children were murdered because, while the children themselves were not the enemy, the danger was the blood within them, in that they could grow up to become dangerous Jews. Rees points to Gröning's ultra-nationalist upbringing as indication of how he was able to justify the extermination of helpless children. Gröning says that the horrors in the gas chambers did eventually dawn on him when he heard the screams.|$|E
