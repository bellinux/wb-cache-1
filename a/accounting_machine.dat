25|$|By {{the end of}} its {{operation}} in 1956, ENIAC contained 20,000 vacuum tubes, 7200 crystal diodes, 1500 relays, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors and approximately 5,000,000 hand-soldered joints. It weighed more than 30 short tons (27 t), was roughly 2.4m × 0.9m × 30m (8 × 3 × 100 feet) in size, occupied 167m2 (1,800ft2) and consumed 150 kW of electricity. This power requirement led to the rumor that whenever the computer was switched on, lights in Philadelphia dimmed. Input was possible from an IBM card reader and an IBM card punch was used for output. These cards could be used to produce printed output offline using an IBM <b>accounting</b> <b>machine,</b> such as the IBM 405. While ENIAC had no system to store memory in its inception, these punch cards could be used for external memory storage. In 1953, a 100-word magnetic-core memory built by the Burroughs Corporation was added to ENIAC.|$|E

50|$|During {{college years}} in Chicago, Mr. Brent worked {{the night shift}} at several {{prominent}} hotels as an auditor and became familiar with NCR <b>accounting</b> <b>machines</b> and computers. Mr. Brent was initially hired by NCR as a programmer for <b>accounting</b> <b>machines</b> and computers (hotel and hospital systems). Three years later Patrick Brent moved to University Company in Chicago; where he received a series of promotions leading to regional manager and was based in Houston. Five years hence Mr. Brent relocated to San Francisco, where he founded {{the first of several}} computer service companies. In four short years, Western Twenty-nine, Inc. grew into a profitable operation with revenues exceeding twenty- eight million dollars, and serving customers in over thirty states and Canada and Europe. The company pioneered data communications between nine major airlines and designed the first reservation and accounting system for travel agents. A few years later a division of the McDonnell-Douglas Corporation acquired the company.|$|R
