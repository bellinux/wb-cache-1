5|$|<b>Ape</b> Escape is a {{platform}} video game, developed by SCE Japan Studio {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment. It was released for the PlayStation in May 1999 in North America, and June 1999 in Japan. The first in the <b>Ape</b> Escape series, the game {{tells the story of}} an <b>ape</b> named Specter who gains enhanced intelligence and a malevolent streak through the use of an experimental helmet. Specter produces an army of apes, which he sends through time in an attempt to rewrite history. Spike, the player character, sets out to capture the apes with the aid of special gadgets.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ape</b> Escape was {{met with}} {{critical}} acclaim from critics, with praise particularly directed at the innovative use of the dual analog controls, {{as well as the}} graphics and music; the voice acting received minor criticism. The game is widely considered {{to be one of the}} greatest on the PlayStation console, and received several re-releases. The game also spawned numerous sequels and spin-offs, beginning with <b>Ape</b> Escape 2 in 2001. A remake, <b>Ape</b> Escape: On the Loose, was released for the PlayStation Portable in 2005 to mixed reviews.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of <b>Ape</b> Escape lasted approximately two-and-a-half years. Shortly after the development team began conceiving {{the design and}} concept for <b>Ape</b> Escape, they attended a meeting regarding the {{development of}} the DualShock. Intrigued by the potential of the controller, the team implemented its use in <b>Ape</b> Escape, making it the first video game to require the use of the DualShock for gameplay. Conceptualizing the controls for the controller's analog sticks was the greatest challenge for the team, and the controls underwent great testing prior to finalization.|$|E

40|$|Planet of the <b>Apes</b> (1968) {{was such}} a hit movie that it spawned several sequels. They {{included}} Beneath the Planet of the <b>Apes</b> (1970), Escape from the Planet of the <b>Apes</b> (1971), Conquest of the Planet of the <b>Apes</b> (1972), and Battle for the Planet of the <b>Apes</b> (1973).

5|$|<b>Ape</b> Escape {{is played}} from a third-person perspective. Players {{use a variety}} of gadgets to pursue and capture the apes, {{traversing}} across several environments. The game's controls are heavily centred around the analog sticks, being the first game to require the use of the PlayStation's DualShock. Development of <b>Ape</b> Escape lasted over two years, and was generally focused on adapting {{to the use of the}} controller, which was a significant challenge for the development team.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ape</b> Escape {{was officially}} {{announced}} in the April 1999 issue of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine. Promotions for the game were held on Cartoon Network during Sony's winter holiday marketing campaign of 1999. A remake of the game, titled <b>Ape</b> Escape: On the Loose, was announced on May 11, 2004, during Sony's press conference at the Electronic Entertainment Expo. It was released as a launch title for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) on March 24, 2005. The remake features altered controls, {{due to the lack}} of a right analog stick on the PSP, as well as some slightly different graphics and mini-games.|$|E
5|$|In July 2004, Blizzard Entertainment began {{collaboration}} with Swingin' <b>Ape</b> Studios {{to work on}} the game, and bought the company in May 2005. Despite anticipation for the game by industry journalists, Ghost was delayed again and its release date was pushed back to September 2005. At Electronic Entertainment Expo 2005, Ghost was officially reannounced, but the GameCube version was canceled by Swingin' <b>Ape</b> Studios due to the platform's lack of online support. The game's release was again delayed until 2006. Despite the efforts of Swingin' <b>Ape,</b> Ghost failed to materialize as scheduled, and in March 2006 Blizzard Entertainment announced an indefinite postponement on development of Ghost while the company explored new options with the emerging seventh generation of video game consoles. Despite its long development history, IGN noted that the concept of Ghost still held promise. Although the game's development was suspended, Keith R. A. DeCandido's novel StarCraft Ghost: Nova was published several months later in November 2006.|$|E
50|$|It {{focuses on}} the five films in the {{original}} Planet of the <b>Apes</b> series, and is hosted and narrated by Roddy McDowall, who played Cornelius in the 1968 film Planet of the <b>Apes</b> and Escape from the Planet of the <b>Apes</b> and his son Caesar in Conquest of the Planet of the <b>Apes</b> and Battle for the Planet of the <b>Apes.</b> The documentary premiered on AMC to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the first 1968 film.|$|R

5|$|Lincoln hired John Kirby to {{represent}} Nintendo in court. Kirby had won other big cases {{for the likes}} of PepsiCo., General Foods, and Warner-Lambert. Kirby researched the game's development, taking depositions from designer Shigeru Miyamoto and Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi in Japan. Miyamoto claimed that he had in fact called his <b>ape</b> character King Kong at first, as that was a generic term in Japan for any large <b>ape.</b>|$|E
5|$|St. Helens {{started its}} {{growth in the}} Pleistocene 37,600 years ago, during the <b>Ape</b> Canyon stage, with dacite and {{andesite}} eruptions of hot pumice and ash. 36,000 years ago a large mudflow cascaded down the volcano; mudflows were significant forces in all of St. Helens' eruptive cycles. The <b>Ape</b> Canyon eruptive period ended around 35,000 years ago and was followed by 17,000 years of relative quiet. Parts of this ancestral cone were fragmented and transported by glaciers 14,000 to 18,000 years ago during the last glacial period of the current ice age.|$|E
50|$|<b>Apes</b> do {{not possess}} a tail, unlike most monkeys. Monkeys {{are more likely to}} be in trees and use their tails for balance. While the great <b>apes</b> are {{considerably}} larger than monkeys, gibbons (lesser <b>apes)</b> are smaller than some monkeys. <b>Apes</b> are considered to be more intelligent than monkeys, which are considered to have more primitive brains.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Corballis {{suggests}} that <b>apes</b> lack voluntary {{control over their}} vocal production. However, recent evidence implicates voluntary control of vocalizations in <b>apes,</b> which {{suggests that}} intentional control of vocal communication predates the hominid-pongid split. Furthermore, {{the ease with which}} <b>apes</b> in captivity manipulate the visual attention of observers implies a common cognitive basis for joint attention in humans and <b>apes...</b>|$|R
5|$|Hadropithecus stenognathus is {{classified}} as the sole member of the genus Hadropithecus and belongs to the family Archaeolemuridae. This family in turn belongs to the infraorder Lemuriformes, which includes all the Malagasy lemurs. The species was formally described in 1899 from a mandible (lower jaw) found at Andrahomana cave in southeastern Madagascar by paleontologist Ludwig Lorenz von Liburnau, who thought it represented an <b>ape.</b> A year later, Lorenz von Liburnau also described Pithecodon sikorae based on photographs of a skull, which upon further review {{turned out to be}} a juvenile version of Hadropithecus stenognathus. In a publication from 1902, he declared that Hadrophithecus stenognathus was not an <b>ape,</b> but a lemur. Over 100 years later, the rarity of its skeletal remains has made this species one of the least understood species of subfossil lemur.|$|E

5|$|A Second Chance at Sarah is {{a fantasy}} graphic novel written by Neil Druckmann, with {{illustrations}} by Joysuke Wong. The novel was originally published by <b>Ape</b> Entertainment on February 24, 2010; Dark Horse Comics re-released the novel on August 20, 2014. The book follows Johnny, {{who makes a}} deal with a demon {{to go back in}} time and save his dying wife, who fell into a coma upon the birth of their son.|$|E
2500|$|Four sequels {{followed}} the original film between 1970 and 1973: Beneath the Planet of the <b>Apes,</b> Escape from the Planet of the <b>Apes,</b> Conquest of the Planet of the <b>Apes,</b> and Battle for the Planet of the <b>Apes.</b> They did not approach the critical acclaim of the original, but were commercially successful. The series also spawned two television series in 1974 and 1975. Plans {{for a film}} remake stalled in [...] "development hell" [...] for over ten years before Tim Burton's Planet of the <b>Apes</b> was released in 2001. A new reboot film series commenced in 2011 with Rise of the Planet of the <b>Apes,</b> which was followed by Dawn of the Planet of the <b>Apes</b> in 2014 and War for the Planet of the <b>Apes</b> in 2017. The films have grossed a total of over $2 billion worldwide, against a combined budget of $567.5 million. Other media and merchandising tie-ins include books, comics, video games, and toys.|$|R
50|$|Conquest of the Planet of the <b>Apes</b> is a 1972 {{science fiction}} film {{directed}} by J. Lee Thompson and written by Paul Dehn. It {{is the fourth}} of five films in the original Planet of the <b>Apes</b> series produced by Arthur P. Jacobs. The film stars Roddy McDowall, Don Murray and Ricardo Montalbán. It explores how the <b>apes</b> rebelled from humanity's ill treatment following Escape from the Planet of the <b>Apes</b> (1971). It was followed by Battle for the Planet of the <b>Apes</b> (1973).|$|R
25|$|Among his notable roles was Armando in the Planet of the <b>Apes</b> film series {{from the}} early 1970s. He also starred in Escape from the Planet of the <b>Apes</b> from 1971 and Conquest of the Planet of the <b>Apes</b> from 1972.|$|R
5|$|Based on genome sequencing, the Tapanuli {{orangutan}} {{separated from}} other orangutans about 700,000 years ago, {{and the two}} other species diverged about 400,000 years ago. The orangutans are the only surviving species of the subfamily Ponginae, which also included several other species, such as the three extinct species of the genus Gigantopithecus, including the largest known primate Gigantopithecus blacki. The ancestors of the Ponginae subfamily split from the main <b>ape</b> line in Africa 16 to 19 million years ago (mya) and spread into Asia.|$|E
5|$|Complementing Nihilistic's and Swingin <b>Ape</b> Studio's {{work on the}} game, Blizzard's {{cinematics}} team—originally {{formed to}} develop StarCrafts cut scenes—created the cut scenes for Ghosts single-player campaign, which are integral to the game's storyline. The team, which originally consisted of six people, grew to 25, and used newer hardware, software, and cinematics techniques to create higher quality cut scenes than those featured in StarCraft and Brood War. The game's trailer, composed of the cinematics team's work, was released in August 2005.|$|E
5|$|Several {{million years}} ago, {{a species of}} small African <b>ape</b> gained the ability to stand upright. The {{subsequent}} advent of human life, {{and the development of}} agriculture and further civilization allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate. By comparison, the Great Oxygenation Event, produced by the proliferation of algae during the Siderian period, required about 300million years to culminate.|$|E
5000|$|Among his notable {{roles were}} Armando in the Planet of the <b>Apes</b> film series {{from the early}} 1970's. He starred in Escape from the Planet of the <b>Apes</b> from 1971 & Conquest of the Planet of the <b>Apes</b> from 1972.|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} <b>apes</b> depart {{the facility}} and cross {{the desert to}} find an oasis. While the other <b>apes</b> joyously celebrate their new home, Maurice discovers Caesar's wound. Maurice then speaks, telling Caesar that Cornelius will know what his father believed in and did to protect the <b>apes.</b> Caesar slowly and silently succumbs to his wound, and Maurice mourns his passing watching over the other <b>apes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The book {{highlights}} {{findings that}} support the capacity of great <b>apes</b> to possess rationality and self-consciousness, {{and the ability to}} be aware of themselves as distinct entities with a past and future. Documented conversations (in sign languages) with individual great <b>apes</b> are the basis for these findings. Other subjects addressed within the book include the division placed between humans and great <b>apes,</b> great <b>apes</b> as persons, progress in gaining rights for the severely intellectually disabled (once an overlooked minority), and the situation of great <b>apes</b> in the world today.|$|R
