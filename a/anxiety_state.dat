40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relative contribution of general (trait) <b>anxiety</b> and <b>state</b> <b>anxiety</b> to threat perception abnormalities in nonreferred children aged 8 – 13 years (N= 299).

Next, they were individually interviewed using an ambiguous story paradigm from which a number of threat perception indexes were derived. Just before the interview started, children were asked {{to fill out a}} measure of <b>state</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Results showed that high levels of general anxiety (as indexed by anxiety disorders symptoms and chronic anxiety) were significantly related to increased threat perception and lower threat thresholds. High levels of <b>state</b> <b>anxiety</b> were also associated with increased threat perception and lower threat thresholds. Regression analyses indicated that general <b>anxiety</b> and <b>state</b> <b>anxiety</b> both accounted for a unique proportion of the variance in threat perception abnormalities, although the contribution of general anxiety was in most cases substantially larger than that of <b>state</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Finally, no support was found for the notion that threat perception abnormalities are the result of the conjoint influence of general <b>anxiety</b> and <b>state</b> <b>anxiety.</b> 17 page(s...|$|R

We then pinpointed affected molecular systems in anxiety-related behavior by an in silico pathway and network prediction analysis followed by validation of in silico predicted alterations with molecular assays. We found distinct metabolic profiles for different trait <b>anxiety</b> <b>states</b> and detected metabolites with altered levels both in cingulate cortex and plasma. Metabolomics data revealed common candidate biomarkers in cingulate cortex and plasma for anxiety traits and in silico pathway analysis implicated amino acid metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, oxidative stress and apoptosis in the regulation of anxiety-related behavior. We report characteristic biosignatures for trait <b>anxiety</b> <b>states</b> and provide a network map of pathways involved in anxiety-related behavior.

40|$|The role of <b>state</b> <b>anxiety</b> in the {{development}} of anticipatory nausea and vomiting (ANV) in cancer chemotherapy {{has been the focus of}} considerable empirical investigation and theoretical speculation. However, while some relationship between <b>state</b> <b>anxiety</b> and ANV is presumed to exist, determination of its precise nature has proven elusive. Specific hypotheses linking <b>state</b> <b>anxiety</b> to ANV are described and evaluated in light of the empirical evidence. These hypotheses include (a) ANV is a symptomatic concomitant of state anxiety; (b) <b>state</b> <b>anxiety</b> directly facilitates the classical conditioning of ANV; (c) <b>state</b> <b>anxiety</b> exacerbates the magni-tude of post-treatment nausea and vomiting experienced, thus increasing the risk of ANV; (d) ANV causes infusion-related state anxiety; and (e) the observed relationship between ANV and <b>state</b> <b>anxiety</b> is a result of methodological artifact. It is concluded that <b>state</b> <b>anxiety</b> can play a causal role in {{the development}} of ANV in some patients. In particular, the hypothesis that <b>state</b> <b>anxiety</b> exacerbates post-treatment nausea and vomiting and thus increases the risk for ANV appears best supported by the data.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{a relative}} predictive value of some stable individual attributes and {{the processes of}} cognitive appraisals and coping with stress in accounting for specific components of <b>anxiety</b> <b>state</b> measures. Self-report instruments for the measurement of selected psychological constructs, i. e. perceived incompetence, externality, stress intensity and duration, situation-specific coping strategies, and the two <b>anxiety</b> <b>state</b> components, were taken {{in a sample of}} 449 male military basics trainees, ranging in age from 18 - 27. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that the set of predictors employed could account for statistically, as well as theoretically and practically a significant part of variance in cognitive anxiety component (45, 5 %), and in visceral-emotional component (32, 2 %) of the <b>anxiety</b> <b>state.</b> The extent of anxiety reactions assessed by both scales could primarily be explained by general perception of personal incompetence, as a relatively stable dimension of general self-concept. Of the ways of coping examined, reinterpretation of stressful events was the only strategy contributing to low level, whereas passivization, wishful thinking, and seeking social support contributed to higher levels of anxiety measured by both scales. The results give partial support to the basic hypotheses on the mediating role of coping in the relationships among particular components of the stress and coping models...|$|E

Os objetivos deste estudo foram: identificar o traço e estado de ansiedade no 10 °dia pós-parto e estado de ansiedade no 30 ºdia pós-parto das nutrizes primíparas e multíparas que apresentam indicadores de hipogalactia; caracterizar o traço e estado de ansiedade no 10 °dia pós-parto e estado de ansiedade no 30 ºdia pós-parto das nutrizes primíparas e multíparas que apresentam galctia normal; comparar o traço e estado de ansiedade das nutiezes hipo e normogalactas, no 10 °dia e no 30 ºdia pós-parto e verificar as possíveis relações entre o estado der ansiedade das nutrizes no 10 ° e 30 ºdia pós-parto com os indicadores de hipogalactia apresentados por elas ou seus filhos. Participaram do estudo 168 nutrizes e seus filhos que formaram 4 sub-grupos com primíparas e multíparas hipogalactas e primíparas e multíparas normogalactas, com 42 mulheres em cada. Foram incluídas no grupo de hipogalactas as mulheres e RN que apresentaram ou referiram um ou mais indicadores de hipogalactia. Os resultados obtidos mostraram que as nutrizes deste estudo apresentam média dos escores de traço de ansiedade correspondentes à média ansiedade e a média dos escores dos estados de ansiedade nos 10 ° e 30 ºdia pós-parto correspondentes à baixa ansiedade. As primíparas e multíparas hipogalactas e as primíparas com galactia normal apresentaram traço de ansiedade mais elavado do que os estados de ansiedade por ocasião 30 ºdia pós-parto. As multíparas com galactia normal apresentaram no 30 ºdia pós-parto, escores de estado de ansiedade mais elevados do que aqueles apresentados por ocasião do 10 ºdia pós-parto e ambos abaixo dos escores do traço de ansiedade obtidos no 10 ºdia pós-parto. Para essas mulheres, a experiência e a normalidade de produção láctea não diminuíram o grau de ansiedade. Em relação aos indicadores de hipogalactia e o estado de ansiedade das nutrizes no 10 ° e 30 ºdia pós-parto, encontramos uma relação direta entre a presença dos indicadores e o aumento do grau de ansiedade materna. Embora tenhamos encontrado relações entre alguns dos indicadores de hipogalactia e grau de ansiedade materno, ficou evidente que a remissão dos sinais maternos e neonatais, depende, na maioria das vezes, da correção da técnica da amamentação através da orientação e oferecimento de apoio às nutrizes. The {{complaint}} about few milk or insufficient lactation has been pointed {{as one of}} the most frequent causes of the weaning or interruption of the exclusive maternal breastfeeding and, the low volumes of breast milk have been associated to the maternal anxiety that could provoke alterations in the physiology of the lactation inhibiting the lacteal production. The objectives of this study were: to identify the trace and the <b>anxiety</b> <b>state</b> in the 10 th postpartum day and the <b>anxiety</b> <b>state</b> in 30 th postpartum day of the primiparous and multiparous nursing mothers who present insufficient brestfeeding indicators; to characterize the trace and the <b>anxiety</b> <b>state</b> in the 10 th postpartum day and the <b>anxiety</b> <b>state</b> in the 30 th postpartum day of the primiparous and multiparous nursing mothers who present normal breastfeeding; to comparae the trace and the <b>anxiety</b> <b>state</b> of the nursing mothers with insufficient breastfeeding and nursing mother with normal brestfeeding, in the 10 th and 30 th day postpartum and to verify the possible relationships among the <b>anxiety</b> <b>state</b> of the nursing mothers in the 10 th and 30 th day postpartum with the insufficient brestfeeding indicators presented by them or their children. Have participated in the study 168 nursing mothers and their children who formed 4 sub-grops with primiparous and multiparours who present insufficientbrestfeedind and primiparous and multiparous who present normal brestfeeding, with 42 women each. Have been included in the insufficient brestfeeding group the women and newborn that presented or they referred to one or more insufficient lactation indicators. The obtained results have showed that the nursing mothers of this study has presented average scores of trace of anxiety according to the average anxiety and the average of the scores of the anxiety states in the 10 th and 30 th day postpartum corresponding to the low anxiety. The primiparous and multiparous who present insufficient brestfeeding and the primiparous with normal lactation have presented higher <b>anxiety</b> <b>state</b> for occasion of the 10 th and 30 th day postpartum. The primiparous with normal lactation have presented in the 30 th postpartum higher scores of <b>anxiety</b> <b>state</b> than those have presented by occasion of the 10 th postpartum and both below the scares of the anxiety trace obtained 10 th postpartum. For those women the experience and the normality of the lacteal production didn´t reduce the anxiety degree.

The interviews included questions about sociodemographics, smoking status, screening for depression (Prime MD e BDI), trait and <b>state</b> <b>anxiety,</b> (IDATE), and alcohol consumption (AUDIT). RESULTS Diagnosis of depression has significantly correlated with female gender, age under 50 years, and higher average scores on trait <b>anxiety</b> and <b>state</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Depressed men (245) were usually younger than 50 years of age, smokers and had higher average score on trait <b>anxiety</b> and <b>state</b> <b>anxiety</b> than those non-depressed.
