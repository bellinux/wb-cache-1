5|$|The mythology {{surrounding}} Rommel {{has been}} the subject of analysis by both English- and German-speaking historians in recent decades. The reevaluation has produced new interpretations of Rommel, including his relationship with National Socialism, his abilities as operational and strategic level commander, and his role (if <b>any)</b> <b>in</b> the July 20th plot to assassinate Hitler. Historians and commentators conclude that Rommel remains an ambiguous figure, not easily definable either inside or outside the myth.|$|E

5|$|Asunción Ocasio Rodríguez {{represented}} Puerto Rico in taekwondo at the Beijing Olympics, and was {{the only}} female athlete from Puerto Rico that Games to represent the commonwealth in the sport. Born in June 1987, Ocasio participated in the Beijing Olympics at age 21 in the welterweight division, which includes athletes under 67kilograms in weight. During the qualification round of the event, Ocasio faced Greek athlete Elisavet Mystakidou. Both athletes scored one point on the other, but Ocasio defeated Mystakidou and advanced to the next round. Ocasio received a bye and skipped the first round's repechage round. During the quarterfinal round, Ocasio again participated in the first match, this time facing German athlete Helena Fromm. In this match, the Puerto Rican athlete scored two points on Fromm, who scored none in return. Ocasio defeated her German opponent and progressed to the next round. During the semifinal round, Asunción Ocasio now faced Canada's Karine Sergerie. Sergerie scored two points on Ocasio, who did not score <b>any</b> <b>in</b> return. Thus, Ocasio's Canadian opponent progressed to the gold medal match, while she challenged Croatia's Sandra Saric for the bronze medal. Saric defeated Ocasio by scoring five points on her, while Ocasio was only able to return one. She placed fifth in the event, tying Australia's Tina Morgan.|$|E

5|$|In {{common with}} {{the battle of the}} Glorious First of June the {{previous}} year, rewards for the British victory at Groix were unevenly distributed. Bridport's dispatch to the Admiralty was short and lacking in detail, the only officer commended being Bridport's own flag captain William Domett, whose ship had only joined the action in the last stages. The situation was worsened by the Parliament of Great Britain, which voted thanks for the battle but specifically named only Bridport, Lord Hugh Seymour and Vice-Admiral Sir Alan Gardner of Queen. This omitted not only the numerous captains who had taken part in the battle, but also Vice-Admiral John Colpoys of London, whose ship had been much more heavily engaged than Gardner's. Numerous historians have commented on these unexplained omissions, William James noting that Douglas and Queen Charlotte were particularly unfortunate in this regard as the admiral normally aboard, Rear-Admiral Sir Roger Curtis, was ashore at the court-martial of Captain Anthony Molloy and consequently the ship received no recognition despite being the most heavily engaged of <b>any</b> <b>in</b> the British fleet.|$|E
5|$|Inscriptions that specify land grants, {{rights and}} {{ownership}} were descriptive of {{the boundaries of}} demarcation using natural features such as rivers, streams, water channels, hillocks, large boulders, layout of the village, location of forts (kote) if <b>any</b> <b>in</b> the proximity, irrigation canals, temples, tanks and even shrubs and large trees. Also included {{was the type of}} soil, the crops meant to be grown and tanks or wells to be excavated for irrigation. Inscriptions mention wet land, cultivable land, forest and waste land. There are numerous references to hamlets (palli) belonging to the hunter communities who resided in them (bedapalli). From the 6th century onwards, the inscriptions refer to feudal lords by the title arasa. The arasas were either brahmins or from tribal background who controlled hereditary territories paying periodic tribute to the king. The velavali who were loyal bodyguards of the royalty were fierce warriors under oath (vele). They moved with the royal family and were expected to fight for the master and be willing to lay down their lives in the process. If the king died, the velavali were required to self immolate on the funeral pyre of the master.|$|E

5|$|On Wednesday, Assad sent Tlass to Moscow {{to seek a}} {{comprehensive}} air umbrella. The Soviets refused but prepared large amounts of military equipment at airfields for dispatch to Syria and sent Marshall Pavel Stepanovich Kutakhov to Syria {{to find out what}} happened to the Syrian SAMs, fearing that NATO might do the same in Eastern Europe. On June 9, Assad met with American envoy Habib in Damascus and rejected his terms, demanding that Israel withdraw its forces from Lebanon as a condition for a ceasefire. US President Ronald Reagan called on Begin and Assad to accept a ceasefire effective at 6:00 AM, on June 10. By noon on Friday, when the ceasefire took effect, the IAF had shot down 82 aircraft without losing <b>any</b> <b>in</b> air combat. A year after the battle, a US fact-finding mission headed by Lieutenant-General John Chain, then deputy chief of staff for plans and operations, arrived in Israel to learn lessons from the battle.|$|E
5|$|Québécois cartoonists would {{propose a}} number of strips {{to compete with the}} American strips that {{dominated}} the Sundays and dailies. The native Québec presence on those pages would become more dominant after 1940, however, with the introduction of the War Exchange Conservation Act, which restricted the import of foreign strips. Albert Chartier created the comical character Onésime in 1943, a strip that would have the longest run of <b>any</b> <b>in</b> Québec. After World War II, during the Great Darkness, comics publication became dominated with religious comics, most of which were imported from the US. Native Québec comics did flourish for a brief period between 1955 and 1960, however, but were soon replaced again with American content, while also facing competition from the new Franco-Belgian publications, which appeared in full-colour, and by the mid-1960s had put the local Catholic publications out of business.|$|E

All six firefighters were injured in the accident, those less seriously were on the step and seat of the carriage, but Collyer who rode on the reel was crushed underneath. Collyer sustained a punctured lung and broken ribs, but managed to survive for almost three weeks before succumbing to his injuries.

5|$|The president's {{term was}} marked by {{disputes}} concerning the country's role, if <b>any,</b> <b>in</b> the expanding conflict in Europe, where Britain and France were at war. Hamilton and the Federalists supported Britain, while Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans favored France. The French had supported Jefferson for president and became even more belligerent at his loss. When Adams entered office, he decided to continue Washington's policy of staying out of the European war. The intense battle over the Jay Treaty in 1795 had previously polarized politics throughout the nation. The French saw America as Britain's junior partner and began seizing American merchant ships that were trading with the British. Nevertheless, most Americans were initially pro-French due to France's assistance during the Revolutionary War, {{and would not have}} sufficiently rallied behind anyone to stop France. On May 16, Adams gave a speech to the House and Senate in which he called for increasing defense capabilities in case of war with France. For this he was roundly derided in the Republican press.|$|E
5|$|Up to 1990, Nicaragua {{had lived}} with forty years of the Somoza dictatorship, through a decade of civil warfare and Sandinista rule, and five years of US imposed {{economic}} sanctions. On 25 February 1990, Chamorro won the election with a 54.7% share of the vote, ousting the incumbent Ortega and becoming the first elected woman president in the Americas. Because the election {{was held in the}} midst of a civil war, it was important both domestically and internationally that the vote was seen to be legitimate. The Esquipulas Peace Agreement which had been brokered by Arias, called for monitoring of elections by the Organization of American States and the United Nations, among other provisions. The election was the most strictly monitored of <b>any</b> <b>in</b> Latin America and involved 2,578 international observers among them former US President Jimmy Carter; Raul Alfonsín, former President of Argentina; Alfonso López Michelsen, former President of Colombia; Rodrigo Carazo Odio, former President of Costa Rica and many Caribbean and US dignitaries. Ortega and his supporters conceded defeat without argument and observers left only a skeleton staff to assist with the transition of power.|$|E
