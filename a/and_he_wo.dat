'Vunce upon a {{time there}} wos a young hairdresser as opened a wery smart little shop vith four wax dummies in the winder, two gen'lmen and two ladies - the gen'lmen vith blue dots for their beards, wery large viskers, oudacious heads of hair, {{uncommon}} clear eyes, and nostrils of amazin' pinkness; the ladies vith their heads o' one side, their right forefingers on their lips, and their forms deweloped beautiful, in vich last respect they had the adwantage over the gen'lmen, as wasn't allowed but wery little shoulder, and terminated rayther abrupt in fancy drapery. He had also a many hair-brushes and tooth-brushes bottled up in the winder, neat glass-cases on the counter, a floor-clothed cuttin'-room up-stairs, and a weighin'- macheen in the shop, right opposite the door.

5000|$|Unlike Kunrei and Hepburn, wāpuro {{style is}} based on a {{one-to-one}} transcription of the kana. [...] Wāpuro thus does not represent some distinctions observed in spoken Japanese, but not in writing, such as the difference between [...] (long vowel) and [...] (o+u). For example, in standard Japanese the kana おう can be pronounced in two different ways: as [...] meaning [...] "king" [...] (王), and as [...] meaning [...] "to chase" [...] (追う). [...] Kunrei and Hepburn spell the two differently as ō and ou, because the former is a long vowel while the latter has a o that happens to be followed by a u; however, wāpuro style simply transcribes the kana and renders them both as ou. Likewise, the irregularly spelled particles wa (は), e (へ) and o (を) must be entered as written (ha, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>wo</b> respectively), not as pronounced (unlike Kunrei and Hepburn, which transcribe the pronunciation).|$|R
