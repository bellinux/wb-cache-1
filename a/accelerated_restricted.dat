The work contains summarized informations about phenology, bionomy and charakteristic symptoms which were {{used during the}} practical research. Next part of the thesis [...] the practical research itself [...] is focused on charting of intensity and spreading direction of the disease in one specific forest section. In this part are also mentioned possible factors, which could modify (<b>accelerate</b> or <b>restrict)</b> {{the growth of the}} fungus in specific cases. Than, in the last part, are walorized financial damages caused by this pathogenic fungus and suggested some interventions, which can contribute to survival of ashes in the forests...|$|R
40|$|Fetal growth {{restriction}} {{followed by}} accelerated postnatal growth contributes to impaired metabolic function in adulthood. The {{extent to which}} these outcomes may be mediated centrally within the hypothalamus, as opposed to in the periphery within the digestive tract, remains unknown. In a sheep model, we achieved intrauterine growth restriction experimentally by maternal nutrient restriction (R) that involved a 40 % reduction in food intake through late gestation. R offspring were then either reared singly to accelerate postnatal growth (RA) or as twins and compared with controls also reared singly. From weaning, all offspring were maintained indoors until adulthood. A reduced litter size accelerated postnatal growth for only the first month of lactation. Independently from postnatal weight gain and later fat mass, R animals developed insulin resistance as adults. However, <b>restricted</b> <b>accelerated</b> offspring compared with both the control <b>accelerated</b> and <b>restricted</b> restricted offspring ate less and had higher fasting plasma leptin as adults, an adaptation which was accompanied by changes in energy sensing and cell proliferation within the abomasum. Additionally, although fetal restriction down-regulated gene expression of mammalian target of rapamycin and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 -dependent pathways in the abomasum, RA offspring compensated for this by exhibiting greater activity of AMP-activated kinase-dependent pathways. This study demonstrates a role for perinatal nutrition in the peripheral control of food intake and in energy sensing in the gastric mucosal and emphasizes the importance of diet in early life in regulating energy metabolism during adulthood...|$|R
40|$|How much {{employee}} {{stock options}} and restricted stock should be granted to employee of target firms? Will providing more stock options and restricted stock give target firm executives {{to sell their}} firms and cash out their accelerated earnings or will providing more options ensure that their incentives remain aligned with shareholder. Therefore mergers will lead to shareholder wealth maximisation. In this dissertation I examine if the <b>accelerated</b> of <b>restricted</b> vesting of restricted stock and stock options upon merger motivates the managers to sell their firms {{if this is the}} case then returns to shareholders should be negative. We find that providing of more equity based compensation does not effect on target firm managers decisions to sell. In fact, we find that accelerated equity based compensation has no effect on shareholders wealth...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} infrastructure investments that reduce transport costs. We use a spatial model of Salop (1979). It {{is well known that}} the number of firms is excessive at free-entry equilibrium (excess entry theorem). We find that the optimal investment level exceeds the ex post cost-minimising level because investments accelerate competition and reduce the number of entering firms; resulting in the improvement of welfare. We also show that, in cases where the excess-entry theorem is true, the desirable policy is the one <b>accelerating,</b> rather than <b>restricting,</b> competition.

40|$|Maximum amplitudes of <b>accelerating</b> {{fields are}} <b>restricted</b> by {{electron}} breakdown and Joule heating losses in conducting walls in traditional accelerating structures. In this paper, we presented a resonant composite accelerating cavity, which utilizes a periodic structure with a dielectric sphere located at a spherical conducting cavity center. The {{presence of the}} dielectric sphere in {{the central part of}} the resonance cavity shifts the magnetic fields maximum from regions close to the metallic wall to the dielectric surface, which strongly lowers the skin effect losses in the wall. By using the existing ultra-low loss Sapphire dielectrics, we made theoretical analyze and numerical calculations by MATLAB, and further make simulated calculation by CST for comparison. The results show that all field components at the metallic wall are either zero or very small, and therefore one can expect the cavity to be less prone to electrical breakdowns than the traditional cavity. Furthermore, the quality factor Q can be three orders of magnitude higher than that obtained in existing cylindrical cavities.

40|$|Avoiding {{negative}} effects of conventional lubrication in forming operations stimulates research on lubricant-free sheet metal forming. Without lubricants, the direct contact between tool and workpiece leads to intensive interaction in terms of increasing friction and wear. Especially, when forming aluminum alloys, adhesion is detected as main wear mechanism propagating already at the initial contact between tool steel and sheet material. Thus, surface modifications {{need to be developed}} to substitute the functions of conventional lubricants. Former studies revealed that amorphous carbon based coatings improved the tribological conditions. Depending on the specific coating type adhesion and friction could be significantly reduced. Besides achieving a lower level of friction, a control of material flow is necessary to improve the forming results in deep drawing processes. Thus, {{there is a need for}} contact zones with higher and lower friction to locally <b>accelerate</b> or <b>restrict</b> the flow of the sheet material. In order to achieve these tailored tribological conditions a broad range of surface modifications needs to be developed and evaluated in a process-like environment. The tribological behavior is affected by coating properties and structure. By varying gas flow and ratio for a-C:H coatings the relationship between deposition parameters and coating properties are investigated. A further approach to realize a broader range of friction coefficients is the laser based texturing of coated tools. Additionally, a laser based heat treatment is investigated to control the sp 2 /sp 3 ratio of ta-C coatings to affect friction and wear mechanisms. The tribological behavior of the investigated surface modifications is analyzed in ring-on-disc and flat strip drawing tests. A surface characterization is performed to identify about the wear mechanisms. Based on the modifications of a-C:H and ta-C coatings a correlation between chemical and mechanical properties and the tribological behavior in contact with zinc-coated deep drawing steel and aluminum alloys is found...|$|R

Excitotoxicity, induced by the aberrant rise in cytosolic Ca(2 +) level, is a major neuropathological process in numerous neurodegenerative disorders. It is triggered when extracellular glutamate (Glu) concentration reaches neuropathological levels resulting in dysregulation and hyper-activation of ionotropic glutamate receptor subtype (iGluRs). Even though all {{three members of the}} iGluRs, namely N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDAR), Î±-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPAR) and kainate (KAR) receptors are implicated in excitotoxicity, their individual contributions to downstream signaling transduction have not been explored. In this study, we report a comprehensive description of the recruitment of cellular processes in neurons upon iGluR activation during excitotoxicity through temporal (5 h, 15 h, and 24 h) global gene profiling of AMPA, KA, NMDA, and Glu excitotoxic models. DNA microarray analyses of mouse primary cortical neurons treated with these four pharmacological agonists are further validated via real-time PCR. Bi-model analyses against Glu model demonstrate that NMDARs and KARs play a more pivotal role in Glu-mediated excitotoxicity, with a higher degree of global gene profiling overlaps, as compared to that of AMPARs. Comparison of global transcriptomic profiles reveals aberrant calcium ion binding and homeostasis, organellar (lysosomal and endoplasmic reticulum) stress, oxidative stress, cell cycle re-entry and activation of cell death processes as the main pathways that are significantly modulated across all excitotoxicity models. Singular profile analyses demonstrate substantial transcriptional regulation of numerous cell cycle proteins. For the first time, we show that iGluR activation forms the basis of cell cycle re-activation, and together with oxidative stress fulfill the "two-hit" hypothesis that <b>accelerates</b> neurodegeneration. <b>Restricted</b> Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
40|$|We analyze {{processes}} {{for the hard}} X-ray emission from the Galactic disk, whose origin has remained enigmatic for many years. Up until now, no model {{has been able to}} explain the physical origin of this emission. Even the most plausible mechanism of bremsstrahlung radiation requires an energy output in emitting particles higher than the luminosity provided by known Galactic sources. We show that this energy enigma can be resolved if the emission comes directly from regions of particle acceleration. In this case, a broad quasi-thermal transition region of particle excess is formed between the thermal and nonthermal energy regions. The necessary energy output for production of electrons emitting 10 keV X-rays is of the order of 10 (41) ergs s(- 1), which can definitely be supplied by supernovae or other known Galactic sources of energy. The temperature of the <b>accelerating</b> region is <b>restricted</b> to a value of a few 100 eV, and plasmas with these temperatures are hydrostatically stable in the Galaxy. Since only background electrons are supposed to be accelerated, the acceleration process does not violate the state of hydrostatic equilibrium in the Galactic disk...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of the generation of an ultra-short (about one micron long) relativistic (up to a few GeVs) electron-bunch in a moderately nonlinear laser wakefield excited in an underdense plasma by an intense laser pulse is investigated. The ultra-short bunch is formed by trapping, effective compression (both in longitudinal and in transverse directions) and acceleration of an initially nonrelativistic (with kinetic energy of a few hundreds keVs) e-bunch that is injected {{in front of the}} laser pulse. The initial bunch may be of poor quality, may have a duration in the order of the laser pulse length or longer and can be generated by a laser-driven photo-cathode RF gun. Our 1 D and 3 D calculations predict that the accelerated ultra-short bunch will show a low energy spread of less than one percent and a low transverse emittance in the order of a nanometer. An energy gain in the GeV-range is feasible at an accelerating distance of a few centimetres. The total number of <b>accelerated</b> electrons is <b>restricted</b> by the beam loading effect only and can reach a value of 10 /sup 8 /- 10 /sup 9 /...|$|R
40|$|Activating {{mutations}} in the GTPase RAC 1 are a recurrent event in cutaneous melanoma. We investigated the clinical and pathological associations of RAC 1 (P 29 S) in {{a cohort of}} 814 primary cutaneous melanomas with known BRAF and NRAS mutation status. The RAC 1 (P 29 S) mutation had a prevalence of 3. 3 % and was associated with increased thickness (OR= 1. 6 PÂ =Â  0. 001), increased mitotic rate (OR= 1. 3 PÂ =Â  0. 03), ulceration (OR= 2. 4 PÂ =Â  0. 04), nodular subtype (OR= 3. 4 PÂ =Â  0. 004), and nodal disease at diagnosis (OR= 3. 3 PÂ =Â  0. 006). BRAF mutant tumors were also associated with nodal metastases (OR= 1. 9 PÂ =Â  0. 004), despite being thinner at diagnosis than BRAF WT (median 1. 2 Â mm versus 1. 6 Â mm, PÂ <Â  0. 001). Immunohistochemical analysis of 51 melanomas revealed that 47 % were immunoreactive for RAC 1. Melanomas {{were more likely to}} show RAC 1 immunoreactivity if they were BRAF mutant (OR= 5. 2 PÂ =Â  0. 01). RAC 1 may therefore be important in regulating the early migration of BRAF mutant tumors. RAC 1 mutations are infrequent in primary melanomas but may <b>accelerate</b> disease progression. <b>Restricted</b> Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
40|$|Telomere {{integrity}} in Drosophila melanogaster is maintained by a putative multisubunit complex called terminin that {{is believed to}} act in analogy to the mammalian shelterin complex in protecting chromosome ends from being recognized as sites of DNA damage. The five proteins supposed to form the terminin complex are HP 1 -ORC associated protein, HP 1 -HOAP interacting protein, Verrocchio, Drosophila Telomere Loss/Modigliani and Heterochromatic Protein 1. Four of these proteins evolve rapidly within the Drosophila genus. The accelerated evolution of terminin components may indicate the involvement of these proteins in {{the process by which}} new species arise, as the resulting divergence of terminin proteins might prevent hybrid formation, thus driving speciation. However, terminin is not an experimentally proven entity, and no biochemical studies have been performed to investigate its assembly and action in detail. Motivated by these facts in order to initiate biochemical studies on terminin function, we attempted to reconstitute terminin by co-expressing its subunits in bacteria and investigated the possible role of the fast-evolving parts of terminin components in complex assembly. Our results suggest formation of stable subcomplexes of terminin, but not of the whole complex in vitro. We found that the <b>accelerated</b> evolution is <b>restricted</b> to definable regions of terminin components, and that the divergence of D. melanogaster Drosophila Telomere Loss and D. yakuba Verrocchio proteins does not preclude their stable interaction...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePhenol {{formaldehyde}} (PF) resin containing {{low molecular}} weight hydroxymethyl phenol species and a water soluble hindered amine light stabilizer (HALS) was synthesized and used to treat wood veneers. Treated veneers were exposed to natural weathering for 25, 35 and 50 days {{and the effectiveness of}} the modified PF resins as photoprotective treatments for wood was assessed. We hypothesized that the photostability of veneers would be positively correlated with concentration of PF resin (10, 20 and 30 % w/v) and HALS (1 or 2 % w/w) in solutions used to treat veneers. There was an inverse relationship between resin concentration in treatment solutions and tensile strength losses of treated veneers exposed to natural weathering. Mass losses of veneers treated with solutions containing 20 or 30 % PF resin were lower than those of veneers treated with 10 % PF resin. The addition of 2 % HALS to solutions containing 30 % PF resin had a significant (p < 0. 05) effect at restricting mass and tensile strength losses of treated veneers exposed to the weather for 50 days. A PF resin treatment containing 30 % resin and 2 % HALS was as effective as chromic acid (a noted photostabilizer for wood) at restricting mass and tensile strength losses of veneers during natural weathering. Treated veneer in a plywood-type composite became darker and redder when exposed outdoors, but the addition of HALS to the resin restricted color changes of veneer treated with 10 % PF resin. A 30 % PF resin treatment on its own or containing 2 % HALS protected wood's cellular structure from destruction during <b>accelerated</b> weathering and <b>restricted,</b> but did not prevent delignification of wood. We conclude that the effectiveness of {{low molecular weight}} PF resin as a photoprotective treatment for wood can be improved by increasing the concentration of PF resin and by combining it with a water soluble HALS.
