5|$|As their {{relationship}} had become increasingly strained, {{his wife had}} left and returned to Britain.

Through friends in the British archaeological community, he was offered a job <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, although he was upset that this would mean a drop in his professional status and income and decided to turn it down. Instead, he agreed {{to take up a}} chair in the Archaeology of the Roman Provinces at the Institute of Archaeology. In addition, the Pakistani Minister of Education invited him to become the Archaeological Adviser to the Pakistani government; he agreed to also take up this position, on the condition that he would only spend several months in the country each year over the next three.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Weaver was {{appointed}} by Premier Thomas Bavin on 16 April 1929 <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> for Mines and Minister for Forests. Taking over the worsening dispute on the northern coalfields, he believed the struggle to be communist-inspired and made possible by unemployment relief and child endowment and attempted to resolve an industrial dispute by supporting the use of non-union labour in the Rothbury coal mine. The resultant protests led to the Rothbury Riot {{and the death of}} one miner. His suspension of unemployment relief gained him many enemies from the Labor Party. This promotion proved short-lived however, when the Bavin Government was defeated at the October 1930 election, at which Weaver was returned with 65.42%, by Jack Lang's Australian Labor Party.|$|E
5|$|Section 201 amended {{legislation}} {{regarding the}} San Francisco Assay Office to allow coins to be minted there (as they previously were {{when it was}} the San Francisco Mint) until such time <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>secretary</b> certified that the mints of the United States were able to strike sufficient coins {{to meet the needs}} of the nation.

5|$|The Order {{has five}} officers: the Dean, the Chancellor, the Usher, the Lord Lyon King of Arms and the Secretary. The Dean is {{normally}} a cleric of the Church of Scotland. This office {{was not part}} of the original establishment, but was created in 1763 and joined to the office of Dean of the Chapel Royal. The two offices were separated in 1969. The office of Chancellor is mentioned and given custody of the seal of the Order in the 1687 statutes, but no-one was appointed to the position until 1913. The office has subsequently been held by one of the knights, though not necessarily the most senior. The Usher of the Order is the Gentleman Usher of the Green Rod (unlike his Garter equivalent, the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, he does not have another function assisting the House of Lords). The Lord Lyon King of Arms, head of the Scottish heraldic establishment and whose office predates his association with the Order serves as King of Arms of the Order. The Lord Lyon often—but not invariably—also serves <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary.</b>|$|E
