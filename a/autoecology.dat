Mean results of some investigations carried out to study the <b>autoecology</b> of wild species (Ammophila littoralis, Spartina juncea and Erianthus ravennae) collected in S.

40|$|International audienceThe {{circadian}} (i. e. 24 -hours) {{vertical distribution}} of phytoplankton community was examined {{for the first}} time in a small, shallow and nutrient-rich tropical lake (Lake Municipal, Yaoundé, Cameroon), in relation to environmental factors. Sampling was done during the late dry season and the water column was very stable. Phytoplankton community was diverse and was dominated by cyanobacterial species which averaged (± SD) 97 ± 1 % and 62 ± 14 % of total phytoplankton abundance and biovolume, respectively. The abundances of these species consistently peaked in the surface layer. Their dominance was related to their positive buoyancy in stable environments, and the resulting shading of surface waters that possibly outcompeted eukaryotic algae. Although most of the extracted chlorophyll was apparently not from the dominant cyanobacterial species, chlorophyll-a concentrations (25. 3 to 234 μg/l), as well as phytoplankton total abundance (1. 42 to 11. 73 x 108 cells/l) and biovolume (18. 24 to 135. 78 x 109 μm 3 /l), were substantial and characteristic of productive waters. The vertical distribution of the dominant phytoplankton species exhibited three different patterns, according to the depths where their maximum abundances were recorded: (1) surface water populations represented by the cyanobacteria Oscillatoria limosa and Synechocystis pevalekii, (2) mid-layer species, the euglenoid flagellate Lepocinclis fusiformis, and (3) populations that actively avoided the surface water during the nighttime, the euglenoid Trachelomonas hispida and the cryptomonad Cryptomonas ovata. We conclude that these patterns were related to several factors, including light conditions, temperature, cell buoyancy, the potential of motile flagellates to avoid adverse conditions such as grazing pressure, and accorded to the <b>autoecologies</b> of algal species involved...|$|R

40|$|The American duckweed Lemna minuta {{shows an}} {{invasive}} behaviour in Europe, causing weed problems in aquatic habitats there. Few studies addressed this species’ ecological requirements for a suitable establishment in a site. In this paper, L. minuta populations were analysed through feld surveys so as (1) to defne the <b>autoecology</b> of this duckweed {{as regards the}} main environmental factors characterizing invaded habitats, and (2) to identify possible overlaps/differences in ecological requirements between the alien L. minuta and the common native L. minor, with which it is often associated and in direct competition. The occurrence/abundance of the two species and environmental {{data were collected from}} 41 wetlands in central Italy. Currently, L. minuta is more common and abundant than L. minor in the study-area, despite its recent arrival there (2007). The two species have a partially overlapped <b>autoecology.</b> However, L. minuta differs from L. minor since it occurs in waters which are less alkaline, slightly less warm, and richer in nitrates. It shows tolerance for environmental conditions which are limiting for most of macrophytes, including L. minor, such as high shading and low water oxygenation. This enables L. minuta to increase its invasion potentiality and thus to enlarge its distribution area...|$|E

40|$|A new phototrophic {{species of}} {{freshwater}} dinoflagellates, Peridinium euryceps sp. nov., is described from Lake Erken, Sweden. It {{is a large}} and extremely flattened dinoflagellate with a characteristic shape and a tabulation that differs from known species of the same genus. Peridinium euryceps appears during winter underneath the ice, encysts at ice melt, and then remains dormant as cysts during summer. This new species has morphological and ecological similarities with Peridinium baicalense, a species endemic to Lake Baikal, Russia. The <b>autoecology</b> of P. euryceps is discussed, {{as well as the}} ecology of cryophilic and cold-stenothermic dinoflagellates in general.

40|$|The macrobenthic {{communities}} of many river basins of Central Italy were sampled and analysed with the Extended Biotic Index, modified for Italian rivers (I. B. E.); 101 watercourses of various typologies were sampled {{and the total}} number of taxa detected was 130, among which 117 were useful for the determination of the I. B. E. A preliminary analysis was performed {{in order to determine the}} correlation between the frequencies of the different Systematic Units (S. U.) and the I. B. E. values. The data were processed in order to develop an index, the Survey Frequency Index (S. F. I.), which computes the presence of a single S. U. at a given I. B. E. score, in relation to the number of sampling sites showing the same score (I = Ay/nBy). The presence of a faunal group- Index of Group Presence (I. G. P.) - and of taxon – Index of Taxon Presence (I. T. P.) - was evaluated estimating the average of the mean families and the taxon presence respectively. The comparison between the <b>autoecology</b> of a given taxon and its relative I. B. E. and Quality Class (Q. C.) index value provides a preliminary interpretation of a reference community structure within a watershed. The analysis of the macrobenthic commu-nity has revealed abnormal distributions of some taxa in relation to the water quality in all of the considered river bio-typolo-gies. In particular, some taxa (i. e. Isoperla, Hydropsychidae, Rhyacophilidae and Ephemerella) have showed higher adaptation levels than expected by the I. B. E. scores.

40|$|It is very {{important}} to know the <b>autoecology</b> of white-clawed freshwater crayfish for managing and conserving its natural populations. For this reason we studied the diet habit of white-clawed freshwater crayfish in Central Italy. We drew freshwater crayfishes from two rivers in the province of Rome, in July ‘ 01, September ’ 01, March ’ 02 and April ‘ 02. Freshwater crayfishes were sexed and measured. Then every stomach and its contents were removed. We observed: 1) stomach repletion; 2) relative importance of different components; 3) frequency of appearance. Within the stomach we observed rather more vegetal material than animal material and detritus. We empathize white-clawed freshwater crayfish to have a mainly vegetarian diet. On the whole, A. pallipes italicus has an important position in the ecosystem both as a scavenger and as a grazer...|$|E

Several physiographic, climatic, edaphic and forestry parameters have been elaborated from the sampling data. The parameter analysis has allowed finding out the parametric values that define the central and marginal habitats for beechwood stands in Castilla y León. The multivariable statistical analysis has enabled us to build predictive models for forestry parameters in relation to the most significant environmental parameters.

40|$|Freshwater {{red algae}} are rarely {{documented}} in Italy, although their presence {{is quite common}} in European watercourses. The few data available about this algal group are reported in broader studies concerning algal flora of Italian rivers. This paper is aimed to broaden the knowledge on red algae in Italian running waters, by providing new findings on this algal group occurrence in Italy. Samples of Lemanea fluviatilis, Batrachospermum gelatinosum, Bangia atropurpurea, Compsopogon caeruleus, Hildenbrandia rivularis and samples at sporophytic Chantransia stage, were collected from 29 sites along 16 watercourses of central Italy. For each species, we provided a review on the European distribution, giving particular attention to its diffusion in Italy. We also contributed to better define the <b>autoecology</b> of these species, by increasing data on their ecology and defining quantitatively their ecological responses to main environmental factors.

40|$|Sediments from Valle di Castiglione in Italy {{provide a}} {{reference}} sequence for Middle Pleistocene to Holocene palaeoclimate {{reconstruction of the}} Mediterranean area. Stable isotope and trace element signals from ostracod valves, as well as palaeoenvironmental analyses (<b>autoecology,</b> community analysis and mutual ostracod temperature range), provided results that cannot be correlated with those derived from pollen and other proxy records. The lack of correlation is attributed to the peculiar geological, hydrogeological and hydrochemical setting of the Valle di Castiglione maar lake. The main trigger for the hydrochemical changes in the waterbody and, therefore, in the ostracod isotopic and trace element signatures, is likely the volcano-tectonic activity in the area. This illustrates how ostracod trace element and isotopic analyses are not the most appropriate tools for palaeoclimate reconstructions from lakes with complex hydrological features, such as some crater lakes, and demonstrates the need for care in selecting lacustrine sequences for such studies. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|Herein are {{presented}} {{the results of}} research of an autoecological nature concerning beached malacological fauna gathered along {{the west coast of}} Sardinia. The resulting data contribute to defining the composition and structure of thanatocoenosis gathered at 35 biosites and allow estimation of the «bathymetric maximum» (30 - 40 metres) equivalent to the greatest depth at which sediments and the remains of molluscs within them are mobilized. Homogeneous «timed» sampling led to useful statistical comparisons between the different malacological associations gathered and made it possible to recognize the stocks of benthic populations most involved in the transportation of material: AP, SFBC, HP. By means of the autoecological analysis of recognized species, especially using data on texture, way of life and biocoenotic significance, the paper discusses the physiography of the sea bottoms mobilized in front of the biosites sampled.

40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to synthesise information on the <b>autoecology</b> of Ruppia cirrhosa Petagna (Grande) in a mathematical model {{and to use the}} model to simulate its growth, production and harvest. Model parameters were allowed to vary as a result of acclimation, following experimental data reported in the literature. Biomass data from Santo André lagoon (SW Portugal) were used to calibrate the model. Validation was carried out with independent data sets from Santo André lagoon and from Tancada lagoon (NE Spain). Model simulations show a reasonable agreement with observed data with a similar biomass temporal dynamics and peaks. Self-shading appears to be an important self-regulating mechanism of biomass growth and production. The results obtained predict an annual net primary production of 361 gDWm− 2 well within the estimates based on harvesting techniques (295 – 589 gDWm− 2). Model results suggest that controlled harvesting of macrophyte biomass may be carried out without affecting macrophyte real net production, through the reduction of light limitation under the plant canopy. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|The {{growth and}} <b>autoecology</b> of two alien {{invasive}} species: Sargassum muticum and Undaria pinnatiﬁda spreading in the Venice Lagoon were studied monthly, during one year, in two sites of different depth. S. muticum was present year-round and reached its largest size (485 cm) and maximum growth (8. 33 cm/ d) at the deepest station. U. pinnatiﬁda was present only from November to May, reaching the highest size (130 cm) in March - April {{in the shallow}} station with growth peaks of 2. 32 cm/ d. The growth of both species was mainly regulated by water temperature, nutrient concentration, especially nitrogen, and water turbidity. The study highlights the different ecological role already observed for the two species: U. pinnatiﬁda prefers eutrophic areas and is not present along the sea-coastline. Its total standing crop does no texceed 0. 2 ktonnes fwt for all the Venice Lagoon.

40|$|Gracilaria vermiculophylla (Ohmi) Papenfuss, an {{invasive}} Rhodophyta recently {{recorded in}} the Po Delta lagoons (May 2008), was {{also found in the}} Venice lagoon in March 2009 and successively in Pialassa della Baiona (Emilia-Romagna Region) in May 2009. The species has colonized the eutrophic and confined areas of Venice by pleustophytic tangled populations (5 - 15 kg fwt m- 2), replacing the allochthonous species whereas it is absent in the areas characterized by low nutrient availability and high water exchange. In contrast, in the Po Delta lagoons and in Pialassa della Baiona it is present everywhere, also with high water renewal, because of the eutrophication caused by the Po river and the industrial area of Ravenna. This study presents the <b>autoecology</b> and distribution of G. vermiculophylla in the above environments, according to their different eutrophication status, showing its relationship with physico-chemical parameters and nutrient concentrations in water column, pore-water, surface sediments and particulate matter collected by traps in a station of the Venice lagoon (Teneri) sampled monthly during one year.

40|$|In {{this paper}} two {{different}} Italian late Messinian lago-mare ostracod assemblages, dominated mainly by extinct Paratethyan species, have been analysed {{by means of}} Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA). The obtained plots have been compared and, {{with the help of}} the limited autoecological data on similar living species and geochemical data on the sediments in which they were included, the <b>autoecology</b> and synecology of the lago-mare assemblages have been inferred. In particular, it seems reasonable to suppose that: 1) assemblages made only by pointed candonids are typical of rather deep (possibly less than one hundred meters of depth) and freshwater/oligohaline environments; 2) assemblages mainly composed of Leptocytheridae point to shallow (probably few tens of meters of depth) and mesohaline waters; 3) diversified and even assemblages made both by pointed candonids and Leptocytheridae are common in rather deep (less than one hundred meters of depth) but oligo/low mesohaline environments; 4) Caspiocypris seems rather tolerant of brackish salinities, but prefers shallow environments; 5) Tyrrhenocythere could be an indicator of shallow and fresh/oligohaline waters. 6) Cyprideis is an indicator of shallow waters but can withstand a very wide salinity range...|$|E
40|$|Trees <b>autoecology</b> {{seems to}} be {{partially}} controlled by leaf architecture which affects water flux through the leaves and probably the tree's drought resistance. The aim of this work is to show, under natural conditions within the tree crown, the influence of light in leaf hydraulic conductance (Kleaf) regulation, the variation of this conductance by PIP aquaporins links with leaf architecture in different tree species. Shade and light leaves of P. nigra, J. regia and F. sylvatica grown in outside conditions were analyzed by HPFM (Kleaf), Q-PCR (PIP transcripts abundance), and image analysis (architecture Parameters). In J. regia, sun leaves show an increase of PIP 1 and PIP 2 transcription, and a less stimulated conductance in response to light than shade leaves. It {{may be due to}} a better acclimatization of light leaves to high irradiance. In P. nigra, no significant correlation between Kleaf and PIP transcription has been found. In F. sylvatica, sun leaves show a repression of PIP 2 transcription with no Kleaf changes. The first leaf architecture data allowed leaf modelling thanks to K_leaf.

40|$|The 13 C/ 12 C {{ratio of}} juniper charcoals from the archaeological site of Arslantepe, Malatya (Turkey) was {{analysed}} for the mid-Holocene period spanning from 3350 to 2000 years BC. In addition, modern juniper and deciduous oak specimens were collected during a botanical survey around Arslantepe in August 2008. After {{the evaluation of}} weather parameters, the modern 13 C/ 12 C ratio was compared with the archaeological one, to infer past seasonal precipitation relative magnitude patterns. δ 13 C values obtained from these samples suggest that the present-day climate is, on average, drier than that recorded in the past. Comparing the δ 13 C juniper record with the already published curve for archaeological charcoals of deciduous oaks from Arslantepe, {{it appears that the}} two curves show similar trends in the short period between ca. 2850 and 2500 BC, in which the curves are substantially parallel and the δ 13 C difference between them is quite reduced, but they are shifted by ca. 50 - 150 years {{in the rest of the}} record. For the interpretation of the arboreal curves, however, it was necessary to consider the <b>autoecology</b> of modern plants and the source of the water used for photosynthesis, as the two selected trees show δ 13 C curves with rather different patterns. Overall, 13 C/ 12 C contrasting ratios in juniper and deciduous oaks suggest that seasonality in rainfall distribution and aquifer recharge played a complex role. Thus, a consistent seasonal contrast in precipitation (similar to the one in recent times) took place at ca. 3350, 3100, and 2300 BC indicating that semi-arid conditions have occurred in the past, in alternation with periods characterised by minor differences in the distribution of annual precipitation. In particular, the period between ca. 2850 and 2500 BC may suggest more humid conditions in late winter/early spring. The combination of the two records suggests that 1) two periods of drought are found at ca. 3350 - 3100 and at ca. 2300 - 2200 BC and 2) that at present winter precipitation is lower than that recorded during the period 3350 - 2000 BC and summer aridity less or equal to that recorded ca. 2200 BC. Changes in precipitation seasonality and the complex and the peculiar hydrogeological situation hindered the interpretation of the isotope records. The use of two taxa having different <b>autoecology</b> and different growing season allows interpretation of the data in terms of changes in precipitation seasonality and of specific habitat in this complex and peculiar hydrological settin...|$|E

Three collections were made in 2006 in the Fúquene Lake, Cundinamarca, Colombia (5 ° 27 ’ 55 ’’ N, 75 ° 46 ’ 19 ’’ W) to describe the habitats occupied by G. bogotensis and to determine its vertical and horizontal distribution. Three sampling zones were selected according {{to the type of}} dominant macrophyte (Eichornia crassipes, Schoenoplectus sp. and Egeria densa). In each sampling zone two different cylindrical sampling traps (cloth and PVC) were placed at three depths: surface, mid-depth and bottom. Three replicates were used for each depth and type of trap. Traps were exposed for 24 hours and checked every 6 hours. In addition to the traps, sampling by electrofishing was conducted in each sampling zone during every month. To characterize the study area, physical and chemical variables were analyzed and the structure of phytoplankton, zooplankton, periphyton, and macroinvertebrate communities was studied. Results showed spatial differences on G. bogotensis habitat occupation and differences in captures at each depth, which depend on the dominant type of aquatic vegetation and size of individual.

By means of a specific sampling methodology, we acquired distributional data of the spiders in the study area and monitored physical-chemical and habitat structure parameters at each plot. We analyzed the data through Bernoulli Generalized Linear Models (GLM). Results pointed out a significant positive effect of the presence of aquatic vegetation in the plot. In addition, the presence of A. aquatica was significantly associated with areas of the resurgence characterized at the same time by high prey availability and low density of predators.

Because {{they survive}} stress {{conditions such as}} extremely low temperature (annual mean < 4 °C), these animals represent a good organism model to analyze the relationship between adaptation to cold and expression of stress proteins such as the 70 kDa Heat shock protein family. Fourth instar larvae of ten species of cold-stenothermal chironomids (Pseudodiamesa branickii, Diamesa latitarsis, D. laticauda, D. cinerella, D. insignipes, D. zernyi, D. vaillanti, Orthocladius (O.) frigidus, O.

Immunodetection and quantification of the relative levels of Hsp 70 family were performed via Western blot analysis. Significantly different levels of Hsp 70 were detected among species. The highest amounts were recorded in P. nivalis and D. insignipes, the lowest in P. branickii. Within the genus Diamesa, lower levels of Hsp 70 were observed in the most cold-stenothermal species than in the less cold-stenothermal ones.

40|$|Investigation of {{the effect}} of {{endogenous}} and exogenous factors on the diet of animals is necessary for a better understanding of their feeding habits. This approach can provide relevant information on the <b>autoecology</b> of a species and its ecological interactions. We investigated the composition and intraspecific variation in the diet of the marsupial Gracilinanus agilis in areas of dry woodland forests (i. e., cerradão) in the Cerrado of Central Brazil, taking into consideration the availability of prey (arthropods) in the environment. We found insects, spiders, birds, and fruits in the scats of G. agilis. Insects (orders Hymenoptera, Isoptera, Hemiptera, and Coleoptera) and fruits were the most frequently consumed resources. Males fed more heavily on insects than females did, whereas during the warm?wet season (October to April), the reproductive females fed on insects more than the nonreproductive females did. On the other hand, the consumption of fruits and vertebrates did not vary between seasons, sexes, or according to female reproductive condition. Moreover, reproductive females fed more frequently on ants and beetles than nonreproductive females did. We also detected both positive (for Isoptera and Hemiptera) and negative (for Hymenoptera) selection of insects during the cool?dry season, whereas in the warm?wet season, these resources were consumed according to their availability in the environment. Our study revealed that G. agilis is an insectivore?omnivore species, but fruits also are a relevant part of its diet.

40|$|Both light {{quantity}} and quality affect the development and <b>autoecology</b> of plants under shade conditions, as in the understorey of tropical forests. However, {{little research has been}} directed towards the relative contributions of lowered photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) versus altered spectral distributions (as indicated by quantum ratios of 660 to 730 nm, or R:FR) of radiation underneath vegetation canopies. A method for constructing shade enclosures to study the contribution of these two variables is described. Three tropical leguminous vine species (Abrus precatorius L., Caesalpinia bondicela Fleming and Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC.) were grown in two shade enclosures with 3 - 4 % of solar PPFD with either the R:FR of sunlight (1. 10) or foliage shade (0. 33), and compared to plants grown in sunlight. Most species treated with low R:FR differed from those treated with high R:FR in (1) percent allocation to dry leaf weight, (2) internode length, (3) dry stem weight/length, (4) specific leaf weight, (5) leaf size, and (6) chlorophyll a/b ratios. However, these plants did not differ in chlorophyll content per leaf dry weight or area. In most cases the effects of low R:FR and PPFD were additional to those of high R:FR and low PPFD. Growth patterns varied among the three species, but both low PPFD and diminished R:FR were important cues in their developmental responses to light environments. This shadehouse system should be useful in studying the effects of light on the developmental ecology of other tropical forest plants...|$|E
40|$|The <b>autoecology</b> {{of species}} has {{provided}} quantified {{information on the}} characteristics of the environment in which forest species grow. These studies have been carried out using research done on a regional basis, and the study of the sweet chestnut represents the first case that has arisen of the same species appearing in two such very different ways. The chestnut has been exploited by man since ancient times and continues to be of use to humans today as a source of edible chestnuts and/or timber production. This work examines the differences in autoecological characteristics between chestnut stands for the production of nuts and timber. The results indicate that chestnut orchards in Spain tend to be located at higher altitudes and on sites with a less pronounced slope than for trees used for timber production. Chestnut orchards are located under climates with greater winter precipitation, lower summer precipitation and greater excess precipitation, as well as lower average annual temperatures and potential evapotranspiration. From the soil point of view the orchards are found in soils which are significantly less sandy, more silty and clayey, and with a significantly lower permeability, as well as a greater water-holding capacity. Taking the whole set of ecological parameters analysed, {{it can be seen that}} it is not the soil or physiographic characteristics but rather the climatic characteristics which basically determine the use which the chestnut stands will be given. It therefore seems appropriate to continue using these climatic characteristics as a guide when assigning the most suitable use for a chestnut stand, whether for the production of nuts or timber...|$|E
40|$|Risk {{analysis}} {{can be used}} as a scientific tool for addressing the health of ecosystems. Here we describe a protocol for characterizing risks in the ecosystems of several polluted soil scenarios in the Madrid Community (Central Spain). Our starting hypothesis was that to recover the health of degraded ecosystems that could affect public health, an ecotoxicological diagnosis of each site is required. The sites we considered were industrial and urban solid waste landfills and abandoned mines. This diagnosis revealed many interacting processes that need to be assessed if we are to realistically address the issue of restoring impacts on ecosystems affected by soil pollution. These processes are: 1) Geo-edaphic processes, requiring the analysis of geomorphologic factors; 2) Chemical–physical processes occurring in the soils, such as the release of anions or cations; 3) Erosion–pollution processes that require an understanding of the <b>autoecology</b> of plant species that could be used for remediation in scenarios with this dual problem; 4) Bioaccumulation–biodegradation processes, requiring the integration of microbiology and plant biology tools to assess any toxic effects on soil and plant subsystem populations; 5) Edaphic–bioavailability processes, since different ecotypes show a varying response to a given soil; 6) Population–ecopathology development processes, essential for both cultivated and native plant species comprising trophic networks; 7) Secondary–primary ecological succession processes, a commonly observed mechanism in old landfills sealed with soils from the surroundings-ecological knowledge of reference communities is essential for a good ecotoxicological diagnosis.; 8) Climate change–global warming processes, of utmost importance for revegetating polluted soils since success will depend both on the soil seed bank and on stochastic processes...|$|E
40|$|In most {{mountain}} regions forests {{growing at}} high altitude have fundamental ecological roles {{and other benefits}} to humans. A key factor affecting the structure and evolution of these forest stands is the spatial and temporal dynamics of natural regeneration. Sound empirical knowledge is therefore important to support management prescriptions aimed at guaranteeing the space and time continuity of the forest cover through proper natural regeneration. By means of a spatial distribution and structure analysis in three 1 -ha permanent plots along an elevation gradient at high altitude, we assessed the small-scale processes and interaction between canopy cover and regeneration establishment in a temperature limited environment. Particular {{attention has been paid}} to the interaction among three tree species (Larix decidua, Picea abies and Pinus cembra) and their specific regeneration behaviour. The spatial pattern of regeneration is very similar in all the tree stands in spite of the increasingly limiting environmental conditions with elevation and the significant differences at species and stand level. On the contrary, the small-clustered organization of individuals, typical of a high elevation area, only becomes visible at the highest sites considering the age spatial structure. Significant differences in stand structure, composition and history in addition to differences in species <b>autoecology,</b> mode and strategy of seed dispersal and growth are not enough to result in parallel differences in the distribution patterns of regeneration. Given that successful regeneration is one of the most significant bottlenecks for high elevation forest maintenance, any management approach should take this into account in order to better sustain the future stand structure and dynamics with likely future changes in environmental conditions.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of palaeoecological {{analyses}} on fossil ostracod communities of the Tortonian and Messinian deposits cropping out in the Baccinello–Cinigiano Basin, a Tuscan (central Italy) post-collisional continental basin. Through multivariate analyses, such as Cluster Analysis (UPGMA) and Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA), several physico-chemical variations in the water body have been recognised. The more ancient (Middle–Late Tortonian) lacustrine environmentwas characterised by a shallowproximal and a deep distal facies with oligo-mesohaline waters. During this stage, the salinity of the lake water was controlled by the dissolution of Triassic evaporites buried at shallow depth in the basin. Instead, the subsequent lower Messinian fluvio-lacustrine environment was characterised by shallow freshwater habitats with variable water flow conditions. During the uppermost lower Messinian, the lake was deep and contained brackish water again. These reconstructions add newinformation on the variability of several ecological parameters such as depth, salinity and water flowconditions and help to clarify the <b>autoecology</b> of poorly known fossil ostracods. Within the fossil genus Tavanicythere, the species Tavanicythere irregularis, Tavanicythere parva and Tavanicythere sp. Q are adapted to deep and saline waters, Tavanicythere lepida is a shallow and less saline water inhabiting species, while Tavanicythere nodosa occupies an intermediate position with respect to palaeodepths and palaeosalinities. Within the genus Loxoconchissa, Loxoconchissa (Loxoconchissa) kinoi and Loxoconchissa (Loxocaspia) tuberosa are characteristic of an oligohaline and deep environment, while Loxoconchissa (Loxocaspia) nuda and Loxoconchissa (Loxocaspia) sp. 1 are more halophile species. Potamocypris gracilis is a polyrheophilic and rather profundal species that can tolerate shallower depths. Paralimnocythere bicornis is a freshwater to slightly halophylic and reophobic species. Vestalenula sp. {{is one of the}} few known Vestalenula species that can withstand slightly saline waters...|$|E
40|$|Trapa natans, an {{invasive}} aquatic macrophyte, {{is currently}} located, in the Great Lakes, only in Sodus Bay, {{on the southern}} shore of Lake Ontario. In this thesis, I review the literature concerning the <b>autoecology</b> of T. natans and present results of controlled growth experiments examining: the effects of propagule mass on germination, local dispersal and plant vigor; stand density and detritus dynamics; {{and the effect of}} temperature on germination and seedling growth. Results are compiled using a modeling approach to determine potential range expansion in the Great Lakes. Experimental work determined that there was no minimum mass required for a T. natans propagule to germinate. Local dispersal by drop of propagules is limited; smaller propagules disperse farther. Progeny plant size was not significantly correlated with original propagule mass {{by the end of the}} study, nor with reproductive output. Surface area of all rosettes was similar by the end of the study, regardless of initial stand density. The number of rosettes decreased in high-density stands but was still significantly greater than that of low-density stands at the end of the study. Reproductive output was greatest in high-density stands. Lower temperatures significantly increased time to germination and decreased seedling growth rate, but did not influence overall germination rate. Prevention of spread depends on constant monitoring and prompt control. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) Dept. of Biological Sciences.

40|$|Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi (Schinus) is an {{invasive}} exotic plant widely {{found in}} Florida and Hawaii. This species is found from the upland pinelands to the mangrove forests of Florida. Dense Schinus infestations {{have the capacity}} to displace native species, reduce species diversity and been shown to reduce faunal use of the community. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if gas exchange patterns of Schinus were significantly different from native species. This work was part of a larger study to determine if the exotic’s physiology contributed to its presence in two upland communities of South Florida. The first was an endemic rock pineland community and the second, a disturbed previously farmed area where Schinus was the canopy dominant. Schinus gas exchange, leaf nitrogen and carbon stable isotope contents were contrasted with four native species for one wet and dry season. Schinus tended to have higher assimilation (A), mesophyll conductance (gm), intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUE) and photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE) than native species in the pineland site during the wet season but these differences were not statistically significant. There were also no significant differences in conspecific plant responses between the two communities. Seasonal differences were, however, significant for most of the gas exchange parameters at either one or both of the study sites. Wet season A, gm, nitrogen concentration ([N]), intrinsic WUE, PNUE and carbon stable isotope signatures (d 13 C) were higher than the dry season, most likely a consequence of greater water availability within the substrate. Although differences in gas exchange could contribute to the invasiveness of Schinus into native pineland and disturbed upland areas, other aspects of its <b>autoecology</b> also play an important role...|$|E
40|$|Jaminia (Jaminia) malatestae is {{a fossil}} land {{gastropod}} {{of the family}} Enidae. The species described by ESU (1988) was dedicated to the Quaternarist geologist and palaeontologist Alberto Malatesta who recognized, {{at the base of}} the Ponte Galeria formation (Rome), the "Blue-grey Helicella bearing clays", stratum typicum of the species, dated to the early Middle Pleistocene. J. (J.) malatestae is an endemic species of central-southern Italy ranging from the early Middle Pleistocene to the Late Pleistocene. It was recovered from deposits with oligotypical assemblages of terrestrial gastropods and small mammals of cold-arid climate. During the Middle Pleistocene the species occurred in Lazio, at Fontignano and San Cosimato (Ponte Galeria and Aurelia formations, Rome) in an oligotypic molluscan assemblage of cold climate and reworked in a politypic assemblage of temperate-warm climate respectively, and in Abruzzo, at Case Picconetto (Pescara) in a palaeosol of an alluvial deposit, associated with non-marine mollusc species typical of open environments and cold climate. In the Middle and/or Late Pleistocene the species occurred in Marche, at Gola della Rossa (Ancona) in a cave-fill deposit with oligotypic molluscs of mountain grassland, and at Polesio (Ascoli Piceno) in a sandy layer interbedded to gravels of the last glacial period, associated with gastropods of open environment and cold climate. In the Late Pleistocene (last gacial period) the species occurred in Campania with oligotypic molluscan assemblage of cold climate from a loess deposit at Telese (Calore River valley) and from a sandy layer interbedded to gravels at Tufino (Naples). Both the structure of the molluscan assemblages and the <b>autoecology</b> of the accompanying species suggest that J. (J.) malatestae populated open-dry palaeoenvironments in the central-southern Italian peninsula during cold climatic periods of the Middle and Late Pleistocene. Its record in non-marine Quaternary deposits of Italy is an useful tool to infer reliable palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatical information...|$|E
