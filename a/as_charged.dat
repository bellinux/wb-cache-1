5|$|During the September term, a {{jury was}} finally selected, {{and the trial}} {{consumed}} {{the rest of the}} term. Much of the same evidence was presented, and the second jury also voted for a guilty verdict. The date for Desha's execution was set for July 14, 1826. Harry O. Brown, the judge in the case, had been temporarily appointed by Governor Desha to fill a vacancy. He set aside the verdict, ruling that the prosecution had failed to prove that the murder occurred in Fleming County, <b>as</b> <b>charged</b> in the indictment. The prosecution unsuccessfully argued that because a change of venue had already been granted, the place of the murder was immaterial.|$|E

25|$|This {{reaction}} {{produces a}} helium-4 nucleus (4He) and a high-energy proton. As with the p-11B aneutronic fusion fuel cycle, {{most of the}} reaction energy is released <b>as</b> <b>charged</b> particles, reducing activation of the reactor housing and potentially allowing more efficient energy harvesting (via any of several speculative technologies). In practice, D-D side reactions produce {{a significant number of}} neutrons, resulting in p-11B being the preferred cycle for aneutronic fusion.|$|E
25|$|On October 1, 2000 at the Anarchy Rulz, Lynn {{defeated}} Justin Credible for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship.

25|$|It was a set-up. The {{two other}} Board members cried off with feeble excuses and I {{had to sit}} alone in judgment.

25|$|By catalyzing the {{phosphorylation}} of glucose {{to yield}} glucose 6-phosphate, hexokinases maintain the downhill concentration gradient that favors the facilitated transport of glucose into cells. This reaction also initiates all physiologically relevant pathways of glucose utilization, including glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. The {{addition of a}} charged phosphate group at the 6-position of hexoses also ensures 'trapping' of glucose and 2-deoxyhexose glucose analogs (e.g. 2-deoxyglucose, and 2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose) within cells, <b>as</b> <b>charged</b> hexose phosphates cannot easily cross the cell membrane.|$|E
25|$|A year later, on October 4, 1813 Jonathan Lewis {{finally went}} to trial… for {{escaping}} jail, not {{the murder of}} Naomi Wise.

25|$|In 2001, Sell appealed on certiorari to the Federal District Court which, while {{reversing}} the federal magistrate's finding of dangerousness, upheld {{the order of}} forced medication {{on the grounds that}} it was necessary to restore Sell's competency to stand trial.

25|$|A {{jury was}} hastily {{selected}} for the second Quinlan trial, with the selection process completed {{in less than an}} hour.

Crazy followed with participation in a series of matches with international cruiserweights as he racked up wins against fellow luchador Mosco de la Merced at CyberSlam, Japanese wrestler Taka Michinoku at Hardcore Heaven while losing to Italian Little Guido at Hostile City Showdown and defeating him at July's Heat Wave pay-per-view.|$|E
25|$|On September 13, 2002, Hovind {{was charged}} with failure to observe county zoning {{regulations}} for Dinosaur Adventure Land, a misdemeanor. In April 2006, the Dinosaur Adventure Land buildings were closed by county officials, and the Florida circuit court found the owners in contempt, ordering fines of $500 for each day the buildings were used. Hovind argued {{he did not need}} a permit {{due to the nature of}} the building, but after a 5-year court battle over the $50 building permit, on June 5, 2006, Hovind pleaded nolo contendere <b>as</b> <b>charged</b> to three counts: constructing a building without a permit, refusing to sign a citation, and violating the county building code.

25|$|During {{the course}} of the speech, {{eighteen}} men gathered outside the schoolhouse. They began throwing rocks and other debris at the school, breaking all of the windows. Enos Hawley and the guest speaker were both injured in the assault. Upon fleeing the school, the abolitionists were pelted with eggs. The rioters followed Hawley and his guest to Hawley's home at the corner of High and Main Streets. They continued the assault on Hawley's home until after midnight, when the local law enforcement officers were able to quell the riot and arrest the rioters. The rioters were indicted in September and went to trial in October; thirteen of the eighteen rioters were found guilty <b>as</b> <b>charged.</b> The jury's deliberation was quite a long process.|$|E
25|$|A {{permanent}} European {{presence in}} New Netherland began in 1624 – making New York the 12th oldest continuously occupied European-established {{settlement in the}} continental United States – with the founding of a Dutch fur trading settlement on Governors Island. In 1625, construction was started on a citadel and Fort Amsterdam on Manhattan Island, later called Nieuw Amsterdam (New Amsterdam). The colony of New Amsterdam was centered at the site which would eventually become Lower Manhattan. In 1626, the Dutch colonial Director-General Peter Minuit, acting <b>as</b> <b>charged</b> by the Dutch West India Company, purchased the island of Manhattan from the Canarsie, a small Lenape band, for 60 guilders (about $1,000 in 2006). A disproved legend claims that Manhattan was purchased for $24 worth of glass beads.|$|E
