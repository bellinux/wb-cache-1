5|$|As an A-type main {{sequence}} star, Beta Pictoris is more luminous than the Sun: combining the apparent magnitude of 3.861 with {{the distance of}} 19.44 parsecs gives an absolute magnitude of 2.42, {{as compared to the}} Sun, which has an absolute magnitude of 4.83. This corresponds to a visual luminosity 9.2 times greater than that of the Sun. When the entire spectrum of radiation from Beta Pictoris <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> taken into account, Beta Pictoris is found to be 8.7 times more luminous than the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is {{inclined}} only about 5.145° to the ecliptic <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> always very near the ecliptic, eclipses always occur on or near it. Because of the inclination of the Moon's orbit, eclipses do not occur at every conjunction and opposition of the Sun and Moon, but only when the Moon is near an ascending or descending node {{at the same time}} it is at conjunction or opposition. The ecliptic is so named because the ancients noted that eclipses only occurred when the Moon crossed it.|$|E
5|$|During {{sunrise and}} sunset, {{sunlight}} is attenuated because of Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering from a particularly long passage through Earth's atmosphere, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> sometimes faint {{enough to be}} viewed comfortably {{with the naked eye}} or safely with optics (provided there is no risk of bright sunlight suddenly appearing through a break between clouds). Hazy conditions, atmospheric dust, and high humidity contribute to this atmospheric attenuation.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter is {{the only}} planet whose {{barycenter}} with the Sun lies outside {{the volume of the}} Sun, though by only 7% of the Sun's radius. The average distance between Jupiter <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> 778 millionkm (about 5.2 times the average distance between Earth and the Sun, or 5.2 AU) and it completes an orbit every 11.86years. This is approximately two-fifths the orbital period of Saturn, forming a near orbital resonance between the two largest planets in the Solar System. The elliptical orbit of Jupiter is inclined 1.31° compared to Earth. Because the eccentricity of its orbit is 0.048, Jupiter's distance from the Sun varies by 75 millionkm between its nearest approach (perihelion) and furthest distance (aphelion).|$|E
5|$|The average {{distance}} between Saturn <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> over 1.4 billion kilometers (9AU). With an average orbital speed of 9.68km/s, it takes Saturn 10,759 Earth days (or about years), to finish one revolution around the Sun. The elliptical orbit of Saturn is inclined 2.48° {{relative to the}} orbital plane of the Earth. The perihelion and aphelion distances are, respectively, 9.195 and 9.957AU, on average. The visible features on Saturn rotate at different rates depending on latitude and multiple rotation periods have been assigned to various regions (as in Jupiter's case).|$|E
5|$|Its {{estimated}} mass is over 23.04 {{times that of}} Jupiter. Additionally, HIP 78530 b orbits its host star at an estimated average distance of 710 AU, which is 710 times the average distance between the Earth and the Sun assuming the brown dwarf has a circular orbit. The average distance between dwarf planet Pluto <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> 39.482 AU, meaning that HIP 78530 b orbits its host star nearly eighteen times further than Pluto orbits the Sun. In accordance with the data, HIP 78530 b would complete an orbit approximately every 12,000 years, although the actual orbital motion of HIP 78530 b is most likely smaller than 710 AU, {{but it has not}} been directly observed long enough to know definitively.|$|E

5|$|When the helium is exhausted, the Sun {{will repeat}} the {{expansion}} it followed when the hydrogen {{in the core}} was exhausted, except that this time it all happens faster, and the Sun becomes larger and more luminous. This is the asymptotic-giant-branch phase, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> alternately burning hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell. After about 20 million years on the early asymptotic giant branch, the Sun becomes increasingly unstable, with rapid mass loss and thermal pulses that increase the size and luminosity for a few hundred years every 100,000 years or so. The thermal pulses become larger each time, with the later pulses pushing the luminosity {{to as much as}} 5,000 times the current level and the radius to over 1 AU. According to a 2008 model, Earth's orbit is shrinking due to tidal forces (and, eventually, drag from the lower chromosphere), so that it will be engulfed by the Sun near the tip of the red giant branch phase, 1 and 3.8 million years after Mercury and Venus have respectively suffered the same fate. Models vary depending on the rate and timing of mass loss. Models that have higher mass loss on the red-giant branch produce smaller, less luminous stars {{at the tip of the}} asymptotic giant branch, perhaps only 2,000 times the luminosity and less than 200 times the radius. For the Sun, four thermal pulses are predicted before it completely loses its outer envelope and starts to make a planetary nebula. By the end of that phase – lasting approximately 500,000 years – the Sun will only have about half of its current mass.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} put a {{priority}} on their schoolwork, ClariS have not released photos of themselves {{to the public and}} employ illustrators to draw their likenesses. When drawn, Clara is depicted wearing pastel pink items, and Alice is shown wearing blue items. Images of the crescent moon are used as a motif to represent Clara, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> used to represent Alice, which comes from their personal preferences. Clara is shown with slightly wavy hair and no bangs, while Alice is drawn with straight hair with bangs. To further preserve their anonymity, Clara and Alice have not told anyone they know (aside from their families) that they debuted as music artists. Both admit that they are otaku, and have taken an interest in anime and anime music. Clara says that she keeps her otaku interests a secret from others at school, and Alice has called herself a Disney otaku.|$|E
25|$|Scene Two {{takes place}} two weeks later. It is midday, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> scorching. Too hot to work, the mechanics, wearing {{sleeveless}} tank tops or stripped to their waists, laze around {{the garage and}} flirt with their girlfriends. Luca has taken Angelo under his wing and is teaching him how to fight. Unfortunately, Angelo shows little skill {{and continues to be}} the subject of the other mechanics' ridicule. Dino arrives, looking rather silly in a straw hat, Hawaiian shirt, Bermudas, and socks and sandals. Taking his briefcase, he leaves for a trip. Luca begins flirting with Lana, who is kneading dough for bread, and mutual seduction ensues. The mechanics and their partners also begin behaving lustily with increasing intensity. Lana leads Luca into her apartment with Dino above Dino's office. They make love, and Luca subsequently emerges dressed only in his underwear and an unbuttoned shirt, smoking a cigarette. He then re-enters the apartment and returns to Lana. Other couples lounge around the garage floor, apparently in post-coital bliss. Dino returns from his trip, and chases his workers and their friends away. He sees Lana through the apartment window and thinks she is waving at him, not realizing she is again making love to Luca with her hand pressed to the window. Dino ascends the metal staircase leading to the apartment, but trips and makes a clattering noise. Lana and Luca realize that Dino has returned. Just as Dino enters the apartment, Luca leaves by throwing his clothes out of another window and climbing down a fire escape. He dresses, but discovers that one of his boots is missing. Fortunately, Lana tosses the boot out of the window. Luca puts it on and walks away quickly. Angelo observes and follows him. Next, we see a car in the garage shaking as two people engage in sexual intercourse within. Luca emerges, buttoning his trousers, followed – unexpectedly – by Angelo. The expression on Angelo's face indicates he has fallen in love with Luca, and in parallel solos, both Lana and Angelo express joyous ecstasy at having encountered Luca that night.|$|E

500|$|The {{photograph}} used on {{the front}} and back cover of the album was taken by photographer Brian Griffin. The picture shows the band on a wet beach in the south of Wales; there are dark clouds in the sky <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> low on the horizon causing the band to be silhouetted. The picture was taken on a day off from recording the album. The original album's cover art was designed by Martyn Atkins. The cover received the [...] "Best Dressed LP" [...] award in the 1981 NME Awards. Reynolds said that the band's manager Drummond saw them as representing [...] "cold, dampness, darkness".|$|E

500|$|Miyazaki based {{some of the}} {{buildings}} in the spirit world on {{the buildings}} in the real-life Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum in Koganei, Tokyo, Japan. He often visited the museum for inspiration while working on the film. Miyazaki had {{always been interested in}} the Pseudo-Western style buildings from the Meiji period that were available there. The museum made Miyazaki feel nostalgic, [...] "especially when I stand here alone in the evening, near closing time, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> setting– tears well up in my eyes." [...] Another major inspiration was the Notoyaryokan, a traditional Japanese inn located in Yamagata Prefecture, famous for its exquisite architecture and ornamental features. While some guidebooks and articles claim that the old gold town of Jiufen in Taiwan served as an inspirational model for the film, Miyazaki has denied this. The Dōgo Onsen is also often said to be a key inspiration for the Spirited Away onsen/bathhouse.|$|E
500|$|The video {{starts with}} Carey {{walking in the}} rain to meet Ne-Yo who is waiting {{for her in the}} studio. Clips of Carey singing in desperation in the rain are intercut with footage of her {{recording}} her vocals in the recording booth. For his scenes, Ne-Yo sings as he stands next to as well as plays the piano as Carey reminisces by herself, while other scenes show him in the booth with Carey as they sing their parts together. At the video's climax, both singers are belt the final note in the booth, which is followed by them walking out of the studio where it has stopped raining <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> shining. Robbie Daw wrote that the video gave him [...] "chills". He also commented on the use of product placement of Carey's perfume M and her own brand of champagne. Melinda Newman of HitFix thought that the video appeared to have a bigger production budget than that of the video for [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] with Minaj, but noted that it was still [...] "low-key" [...] for a Carey video. Newman further commented that while the singer appears to be wearing albeit little make-up, she looked more natural and [...] "beautiful" [...] than ever. Leonie Cooper thought that the video made the [...] "bland" [...] song more appealing: [...] "the video, with a moist Mariah mithering in the rain, preposterous sequinned gold boots, a puppy in the studio, and shameless pimping of her latest perfume, kind of makes up for it." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} solar panels {{may also be}} mounted {{vertically}} above {{each other in a}} tower, if the zenith distance of the Sun is greater than zero, and the tower can be turned horizontally as a whole and each panels additionally around a horizontal axis. In such a tower the panels can follow the Sun exactly. Such a device may be described as a ladder mounted on a turnable disk. Each step of that ladder is the middle axis of a rectangular solar panel. In case the zenith distance of the Sun reaches zero, the [...] "ladder" [...] may be rotated to the north or the south to avoid a solar panel producing a shadow on a lower solar panel. Instead of an exactly vertical tower one can choose a tower with an axis directed to the polar star, meaning that it is parallel to the rotation axis of the Earth. In this case the angle between the axis <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> always larger than 66 degrees. During a day it is only necessary to turn the panels around this axis to follow the Sun. Installations may be ground-mounted (and sometimes integrated with farming and grazing) or built into the roof or walls of a building (building-integrated photovoltaics).|$|E

2500|$|A {{portion of}} the beam of light coming from the sun {{scatters}} off molecules of gas and other small particles in the atmosphere. Here, Rayleigh scattering primarily occurs through sunlight's interaction with randomly located air molecules. It is this scattered light that gives the surrounding sky its brightness and its color. As previously stated, Rayleigh scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength, so that shorter wavelength violet and blue light will scatter more than the longer wavelengths (yellow and especially red light). However, the Sun, like any star, has its own spectrum and so I0 in the scattering formula above is not constant but falls away in the violet. In addition the oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere absorbs wavelengths {{at the edge of}} the ultra-violet region of the spectrum. [...] The resulting color, which appears like a pale blue, actually is a mixture of all the scattered colors, mainly blue and green. [...] Conversely, glancing toward the sun, the colors that were not scattered away — the longer wavelengths such as red and yellow light — are directly visible, giving the sun itself a slightly yellowish hue. Viewed from space, however, the sky is black <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> white.|$|E
