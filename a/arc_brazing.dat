40|$|<b>Arc</b> <b>brazing</b> has, in {{comparison}} to arc welding, the advantage of less heat input while joining galvanized sheet metals. The evaporation of zinc is reduced in the areas adjacent to the joint and improved corrosion protection is achieved. In the automotive industry, lightweight design is a key technology {{against the background of}} the weight and environment protection. Structured sheet metals have higher stiffness compared to typical automobile sheet metals and therefore they can {{play an important role in}} lightweight structures. In the present paper, three <b>arc</b> <b>brazing</b> variants of galvanized structured sheet metals were validated in terms of the corrosion behavior. The standard gas metal <b>arc</b> <b>brazing,</b> the pulsed <b>arc</b> <b>brazing,</b> and the cold metal transfer (CMTÂ®) in combination with a pulsed cycle were investigated. In experimental climate change tests, the influence of the brazing processes on the corrosion behavior of galvanized structured sheet metals was investigated. After that, the corrosion behavior of brazed structured and flat sheet metals was compared. Because of the selected lap joint, the valuation of damage between sheet metals was conducted. The pulsed CMT brazing has been derived from the results as the best brazing method for the joining process of galvanized structured sheet metals...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To {{enlarge the}} field of {{application}} of aluminum matrix composites (AMC) suitable joining technologies are necessary. Especially dissimilar joints like between AMC and stainless steel are of interest. In this work the <b>arc</b> <b>brazing</b> of this material combination is investigated. A new filler based on the ternary system Al-Ag-Cu is used. The results of wetting tests of the base filler and adapted variants are described and discussed. Wetting angles and microstructure of the interfaces are regarded...|$|E
40|$|Appropriate {{substrate}} surface wetting by a molten filler ensures a sound {{bead profile}} during brazing. A theory {{to estimate the}} wetting length considering gradual cooling of liquid filler and loss {{in its ability to}} spread is currently unavailable. We present here a methodology to estimate wetting length based on the minimisation of energy for spreading of a liquid filler considering its gradual cooling and tested the computed results in gas metal <b>arc</b> <b>brazing</b> of galvanised sheets {{for a wide range of}} conditions. The computed wetting lengths are used further to estimate bead height and toe angle of joint profile...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the course and}} the results of technological tests related to TIG-based <b>arc</b> <b>braze</b> welding of titanium and AW- 5754 (AlMg 3) aluminium alloy. The tests involved the use of an aluminium filler metal (Al 99. 5) and two filler metals based on Al-Si alloys (AlSi 5 and AlSi 12). Braze welded joints underwent tensile tests, metallographic examinations using a light microscope as well as structural examinations involving the use of a scanning electron microscope and an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The highest strength and quality of welds was obtained when the Al 99. 5 filler metal was used in a braze welding process. The tests enabled the development of the most convenient braze welding conditions and parameters...|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of research into the fume and gas emission during MIG/MAG <b>arc</b> weld <b>brazing.</b> Investigations were conducted for hot - dip coated steel sheets with zinc and zinc and iron alloy coatings. Steel grades of DX 54 D Z 100 MBO and DX 54 D ZF 100 RBO were used during research. ARC shielding gases applied were Ar + O 2, Ar + CO 2, Ar + H 2 and Ar + CO 2 + H 2 gas mixtures. Analysis of the results covers the influence of chemical composition of shielding gas effect on the emission rate of total fume, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide...|$|R
40|$|Beryllium is an {{interesting}} metal that has a strength to weight ratio six times that of steel. Because of its unique mechanical properties, beryllium is used in aerospace applications such as satellites. In addition, beryllium is also used in x-ray windows because it is nearly transparent to x-rays. Joining of beryllium has been studied for decades (Ref. l). Typically joining processes include braze-welding (either with gas tungsten arc or gas metal <b>arc),</b> soldering, <b>brazing,</b> and electron beam welding. Cracking which resulted from electron beam welding was recently studied to provide structure/property relationships in autogenous welds (Ref. 2). Braze-welding utilizes a welding arc to melt filler, and {{only a small amount}} of base metal is melted and incorporated into the weld pool. Very little has been done to characterize the braze-weld in terms of the structure/property relationships, especially with reference to multipass welding. Thus, this investigation was undertaken to evaluate the effects of multiple passes on microstructure, weld metal composition, and resulting material properties for beryllium welded with aluminum-silicon filler metal...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Thermal anchor {{is one of}} the key {{components}} in ITER magnet supports to maintain the low temperature for superconductor coils. The sufficient attachment of the cooling pipe to the support plates is needed to minimize the risk of helium leakage. Brazing {{is one of the}} best choices. Three kinds of special brazing filler, including SnPb brazing filler, Ag-based and Cu-based brazing filler, were developed, which have good thermal conductivity, and toughness for brazing connection of SS 316 LN at both room temperature and 77 K environment. Some brazing technologies, including induction brazing, vaccum brazing, fire brazing, and <b>arc</b> <b>brazing,</b> have being investigated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Brazing {{is one of}} the key {{technologies}} in the field of joining of metal components. To improve the wetting of brazing material and work-piece surface, it is often required to fall back on the use of flux. The application of these substances requires accuracy and is often connected with considerable expenditure and it is, just as the removal of flux residues, often an additional working step which has to be carried out manually. Within the framework of a DFG research project it has been investigated to which degree gaseous substances as addition to the shielding gas may replace conventional flux in TIG <b>arc</b> <b>brazing.</b> To this end, investigations have been carried out using different combinations of base and filler materials. Mainly monosilane as a gaseous flux substitute has been added in low concentrations to the shielding gas volume flow. The resulting brazed joints have been quantified with regard to their geometry, their fusion conditions and their chemical compositions. These qualities were then correlated and evaluated with the provided quantity of monosilane in order to identify dependencies...|$|E
