40|$|Background. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the diagnostic accuracy of nor-cholesterol radionuclide imaging in patients with adrenal tumors detected by CT or MR imaging studies. Methods. We studied 41 patients (18 M and 23 F, mean age 47 ± 15 years) with hypersecreting (n= 19) or non-hypersecreting (n= 22) unilateral adrenal tumors. All patients underwent iodine- 131 nor-cholesterol <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy.</b> Pathology examinations (n= 26) or CT follow-up studies (n= 15) were obtained. Adrenal lesions were represented by 34 adenomas, 2 cysts, 1 myelolipoma, 1 pheochromocytoma, 1 carcinoma and 2 metastases. Radionuclide studies were qualitatively evaluated and the corresponding results were classified as true-positive (TP), true-negative, false-positive (FP) and false-negative. Diagnostic sensitivity, specificity and accuracy as well as positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values were calculated. In addition, nor-cholesterol uptake was semi-quantitatively compared between hypersecreting and non-hypersecreting adenomas using a four-point scoring. Results. The diagnostic values of nor-cholesterol scintigraphy to identify adrenal adenomas were: sensitivity 100 %, specificity 71 %, accuracy 95 %, PPV 94 % and NPV 100 %; of note, 2 FP cases were observed represented by a pheochromocytoma and a myelolipoma, while no FN findings occurred. A significantly (p= 0. 01) higher nor-cholesterol uptake was observed in hypersecreting (n= 19) adenomas compared to non-hypersecreting (n= 15) lesions; however, no significant difference in tumor size was found in this comparative analysis. Conclusion. In the large majority of cases, <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> using nor-cholesterol was able to characterize specific lesions as cortical adenomas. These findings show relevant clinical impact particularly in patients with non-hypersecreting adenomas; in this setting, laboratory data are not helpful for lesions characterization, while radionuclide abnormalities allow tumor-type identification. However, rare as well as unusual findings of <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> may be observed since nor-cholesterol uptake was also found in two non-adenoma tumors (a myelolipoma and a pheochromocytoma). Finally, the lower nor-cholesterol uptake of non-hypersecreting adenomas might suggest a normal hormone synthesis of these lesions and, thus, regular secretion...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyzed}} the clinical, hormonal, immunohistochemical and genetic features in a 69 -yr-old Caucasian {{woman with a}} very rare "composite and mixed pheochromocytoma". This was characterized by right adrenal pheochromocytoma associated with homolateral ganglioneuroma and controlateral adrenal cortical adenoma. The three tumors, incidentally discovered, proved to be non-functioning (normal secretion of catecholamines and of other neuroendocrine peptides, glucocorticoids, mineralcorticoids and androgens). Accordingly, the patient showed no sign or symptom of endocrine disease. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) demonstrated a typical adenomatous lesion on the left adrenal gland with precocious uptake of the radiotracer on radioidine (131 I) -norcholesterol <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy,</b> while the controlateral gland showed hyperdensity on CT, hyperintensity on MR and no uptake at <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy.</b> In addition, CT and MR revealed a vertebral and two hepatic hemangiomas. The right adrenal gland was surgically removed and, microscopically, pheochromocytoma and ganglioneuroma areas appeared intermixed without a predominant component. The former showed strong immunoreactivity for chromogranin, synaptophysin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and CD 34, while the latter appeared positive for neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S- 100. Peripheral blood genomic DNA analysis revealed a new intronic variant (5557 A>G) in the von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL) not observed in our control population...|$|E
40|$|In {{a patient}} with the {{clinical}} diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, the localization of the tumor is essential for planning treatment.

40|$|A sixty eight-year-old man was {{admitted}} to our hospital complaining of macroscopic hematuria. Ultrasonography, X-ray and laboratory examination revealed a right ureter tumor and left non-functioning adrenal tumor. Pathological diagnosis was transitional cell carcinoma of the ureter and left adrenocortical carcinoma. A review of persistent Japanese literature revealed this case to be the 97 th case of non-functioning adrenocortical carcinoma and the first case synchronously occurring with transitional cell carcinoma of the ureter. Forty eight cases of synchronously occurring transitional cell carcinoma of the ureter with cancers in other organs, especially renal cell carcinoma and gastric cancer, have been reported.

40|$|A 64 -year-old {{woman was}} {{referred}} to our unit for an incidentally discovered right adrenal mass. She had no clinical features of Cushing's syndrome. She had normal serum cortisol and ACTH, but the cortisol diurnal rhythm was absent, and plasma cortisol was not suppressed by loperamide test or by overnight low (1 mg) and high (8 mg) dose dexamethasone. 131 I-Norcholesterol scintigraphy showed abnormal uptake of the radiotracer {{in the region of}} the right adrenal gland. After right adrenalectomy, adrenal insufficiency developed that required cortisol replacement for 10 months. At the end of this period, there was full recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary <b>adrenal</b> axis, and <b>scintigraphy</b> revealed normal uptake of the previously suppressed left adrenal gland. We conclude that 'pre-Cushing's syndrome' is a real clinical entity, and preoperative diagnosis will alert the clinician to the possibility of unanticipated adrenal crisis if the mass is removed...|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} case of adrenal ganglioneuroma. A 29 -year-old man was {{referred}} to our clinic for further investigation of right abdominal mass incidentally discovered by ultrasonography. Endocrinological study was unremarkable. Abdominal computed tomography revealed well-defined, 6 -cm-long oval mass with mottled calcification. <b>Adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> showed enlarged adrenal gland with low accumulation. T 1 -image of magnetic resonance depicted hypointensity tumor in comparison with liver. Extirpation of this tumor disclosed yellowish white, homogeneous mass, 101 g in weight and 7 by 7 by 3. 5 cm in diameter. Pathological diagnosis was ganglioneuroma. All reported cases of adrenal ganglioneuroma exceeded 5 cm in diameter. This indicates malignancy in computed tomography. Therefore, we should be careful in diagnosing ganglioneuroma...|$|E
40|$|In {{a patient}} with primary aldosteronism, in which the {{postural}} endocrine tests suggested {{the presence of an}} aldosteronoma rather than hyperplasia, bilateral adrenal tumours were found by computer tomography. <b>Adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> using 6 - 131 I-iodomethyl- 19 -norcholesterol (NP 59) during dexamethasone suppression showed early unilateral adrenal visualization on the left side. After removal of the left adrenal gland, which contained a 2 x 2 x 2 cm adenoma, the blood pressure and aldosterone levels returned to normal. A CT-scan, performed 1 year after the pre-operative CT-scan, showed no change in size of the right adrenal tumour, consistent with a non-functioning adenoma.

40|$|Low renin {{hypertension}} and mineralocorticoid excessP- 639 : Low renin {{hypertension and}} mineralocorticoid excess Mineralocorticoid excess has being increasingly diagnosed in arterial hypertension {{and is known}} to be associated with a low renin condition; however it may escape diagnosis in the absence of overt hypokalemia and aldosteronism. Aim {{of the study was to}} assess in hypertensive patients the relationship between a low renin profile and adrenal abnormalities evaluated by CT and adrenocortical scintigraphy. CT of the adrenal regions without contrast media injection was performed in 34 normokalemic hypertensive patients with low PRA levels(≤ 0, 65 ng/ml/hr) and either high-normal or mildly elevated aldosterone levels (range 120 – 220 pg/ml) and in a series of eight hypertensive patients with comparable aldosterone but normal PRA levels (> 0, 65 ng/ml/hr). All patients had their antihypertensive treatment withdrawn and were under no salt restriction for at least one week at the time of laboratory examination. Iodomethyl-Nor-cholesterol <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> under ACTH suppression by oral desamethasone was performed only in positive CT studies. Adrenal CT was normal in the control population but showed either bilateral or unilateral abnormalities in 20 low renin patients: bilateral hyperplasia (n= 8), unilateral hyperplasia (n= 3), unilateral nodule (n= 9). Scintigraphy showed hyperfunctioning glands in 11 out of 16 patients who underwent the examination (8 bilaterally, 3 unilaterally). A low renin profile with inappropriately mantained aldosterone secretion in arterial hypertension may suggest adrenocortical hyperplasia or adenoma. A screening by means of adrenal CT is indicated, to be followed in the positive cases by <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> or adrenal vein sampling. This workup could allow a correct diagnosis and tailored treatment...|$|E

40|$|To {{illustrate}} {{the role of}} radiopharmaceuticals in characterizing non-hypersecreting adrenal masses, 56 patients with non-hypersecreting unilateral adrenal tumors detected on CT and/or MR underwent <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy.</b> Radionuclide studies (n= 83) included nor-cholesterol (n= 24), metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) (n= 23), deoxyglucose (FDG) (n= 26) and somatostatin analogs (SAs) (n= 10) scans. Histology (n= 32) or biopsy (n= 24) were obtained. Lesions were 19 adenomas, 4 cysts, 1 myelolipoma, 1 neurinoma, 2 ganglioneuromas, 5 pheochromocytomas, 4 pseudotumors, 6 carcinomas, 2 sarcomas, 1 fibro-histiocytoma and 11 metastases. For nor-cholesterol, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 100 %, 71 % and 92 %, respectively; positive predictive value (PPV) was 89 %, while negative predictive value (NPV) was 100 %. For MIBG, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 100 %, 94 % and 96 %, respectively; PPV was 83 %, while NPV was 100 %. For FDG, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 100 %, 100 % and 100 %, respectively; PPV and NPV were 100 %; furthermore, in 7 patients with malignant adrenal tumors, FDG imaging scan was able to reveal extra-adrenal tumor sites (n= 29). For SAs, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 80 %, 100 % and 90 %, respectively; PPV was 100 %, while NPV was 83 %. In non-hypersecreting adrenal masses, nuclear imaging using specific labeled radiopharmaceuticals such as nor-cholesterol, MIBG, FDG ans SAs may provide functional information for tissue characterization. Nor-cholesterol and MIBG scans are able to identify benign tumors such as adenoma and pheochromocytoma respectively, while FDG and Sas imaging allow the recognition of malignant adrenal lesions. Thus, <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> is recommended for tumor diagnosis in non-hypersecreting adrenal masses and, hence, for appropriate treatment planning of such patients, particularly when CT and/or MR findings are uncertain as well as inconclusive for lesion characterization...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the results of nor-cholesterol {{scintigraphy}} and those of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in characterizing adrenal adenomas and differentiating between hypersecreting and non-hypersecreting lesions. We studied 41 patients (18 M and 23 F, mean age 47 ± 15 years) with hypersecreting (n= 19) or non-hypersecreting (n= 22) unilateral adrenal tumors; all patients underwent iodine- 131 nor-cholesterol <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> and MRI studies. Pathology examinations (n= 26) or follow-up data (n= 15) were obtained showing 34 adenomas, 2 cysts, 1 myelolipoma, 1 pheochromocytoma, 1 carcinoma and 2 metastases. Imaging studies were qualitatively evaluated and the corresponding results were classified as true-positive, true-negative, false-positive and false-negative calculating diagnostic accuracy of each test. Imaging studies were also quantitatively assessed comparing nor-cholesterol uptake and MRI signal intensity ratios (SIRs) in hypersecreting and non-hypersecreting adenomas. The diagnostic accuracies of nor-cholesterol scintigraphy (95 %) and MRI (93 %) to identify adrenal adenomas were comparable; however, while a significantly (p= 0. 01) higher nor-cholesterol uptake was observed in hypersecreting (n= 19) adenomas compared to non-hypersecreting (n= 15) lesions, no significant differences in MRI SIRs were found in this comparative analysis; furthermore, no significant difference in tumor size occurred between hypersecreting and non-hypersecreting adenomas. In conclusion, <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> using nor-cholesterol and MRI are both able to accurately identify cortical adenomas; in particular, while quantitative analysis of nor-cholesterol uptake is effective to differentiate between hypersecreting and non-hypersecreting adenomas, MRI SIRs evaluation is not useful for this purpose. These findings have relevant clinical implications particularly in patients with non-hypersecreting adenomas; in such patients, laboratory data are not helpful for lesion diagnosis, while imaging findings allow tumor characterization; in particular, the lower nor-cholesterol uptake observed in non-hypersecreting adenomas might reflect the normal hormone synthesis status of these lesions and, thus, regular secretion...|$|E

As for surgical approach to the adrenal gland, the anterior subcostal incision provided us superior surgical exposure to the adrenals, bilateral accessibility and less complications than the other approaches. A difference on the postoperative blood pressure reduction pattern was noted according to the adrenal disorders: In contrast to immediate normotension after surgery in pheochromocytoma cases, normotension was achieved one month postoperatively in primary aldosteronism.

40|$|AIM: In {{patients}} with non-hypersecreting adrenal masses, tumor characterization is clinically relevant {{to establish the}} appropriate treatment planning. The {{aim of this study}} was to comparatively characterize such adrenal lesions using MR and radionuclide techniques. METHODS: Thirty {{patients with}} non-hypersecreting unilateral adrenal tumors underwent both MR and <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy.</b> MR was performed using SE T 1 - (pre- and post-gadolinium DTPA) and T 2 -weighted images as well as in- and out-phase chemical-shift imaging (CSI). MR qualitative and quantitative (signal intensity ratios) evaluation was performed. Radionuclide studies consisted of iodine- 131 nor-cholesterol (n= 20), iodine- 131 MIBG (n= 15) and fluorine- 18 FDG PET (n= 11) scans. Histology (n= 16), biopsy (n= 3) or clinical-imaging follow-up (n= 11) demomstrated 13 adenomas, 3 cysts, 2 myelolipomas, 4 pheochromocytomas (pheos), 4 carcinomas, 1 sarcoma and 3 metastases. Comparative imaging analysis was focused on adenomas, pheos and malignant tumors. RESULTS: Qualitative MR evaluation showed: signal T 2 -hyperintensity in 46 % of adenomas and in 100 % of pheos and malignant tumors, no gadolinium enhancement in 92 % of adenomas and definite signal intensity loss on CSI in 100 % of such tumor lesions, gadolinium enhancement in 100 % of pheos and in 63 % of malignancies and no absolute change of signal intensity on CSI in 100 % of both pheos and malignancies. Quantitative MR analysis demonstrated: significantly higher signal T 2 -hyperintensity of pheos compared to adenomas and malignancies as well as significantly higher enhancement after gadolinium in pheos compared to adenomas and malignancies (p< 0. 03). Radionuclide studies showed significantly increased nor-cholesterol uptake only in adenomas (n= 13), significant MIBG accumulation only in pheos (n= 4) and FDG activity only in malignant adrenal lesions (n= 8). CONCLUSION: MR techniques may provide some presumptive criteria to characterize non-hypersecreting adrenal masses, such as no gadolinium enhancement and definite signal intensity loss on CSI in adenomas or quantitatively measured T 2 -hyperintensity and gadolinium enhancement in pheos. On the other hand, radionuclide modalities offer more specific findings in this setting since nor-cholesterol and MIBG scans are respectively able to reveal benign tumors such as adenoma and pheochromocytoma, while FDG imaging allows identification of malignant adrenal lesions. <b>Adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> is recommended in those patients, when MR images are uncertain or inconclusive...|$|E
40|$|A 53 -year-old female had {{a history}} of {{long-term}} hemodialysis. Periodic follow-up abdominal ultrasonography revealed a tumor measuring 4 cm in diameter in an area adjacent to the upper pole of the right kidney. Abdominal computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a right adrenal tumor. Furthermore, <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> after dexamethasone inhibition showed accumulation in the right adrenal gland. An endocrinological test revealed that the plasma renin activity (PRA) was normal, and that the plasma aldosterone (PAC) level was increased to 1, 021. 8 ng/dl. The PAC-to-PRA ratio (ARR) was 5, 109. Under a diagnosis of aldosterone-producing adrenal tumor, laparoscopic right adrenalectomy was performed. After surgery, the PAC level was normalized. Pathological findings showed adrenal cortical adenoma. Primary aldosteronism causes hypertension, hypopotassiumemia, hyporeninemia, and hyperaldosteronemia via excessive secretion of aldosterone in the adrenal glands. However, the patient showed a high serum level of potassium due to anuria, and hypertension was not noted. Thus, some dialysis patients with primary aldosteronism do not show any typical clinical symptoms.

40|$|A {{functional}} lesion in corticotrophin (ACTH) -independent Cushing’s {{syndrome is}} difficult to distinguish from lesions of bilateral adrenal masses. Methods for distinguishing these lesions include adrenal venous sampling and 131 I- 6 β-iodomethyl- 19 -norcholesterol (131 I-NP- 59) scintigraphy. We present {{a case of a}} 29 -year-old Han Chinese female patient with a history of hypercholesterolaemia and polycystic ovary syndrome. She presented with a 6 month history of an 8 kg body weight gain and gradual rounding of the face. Serial examinations revealed loss of circadian rhythm of cortisol, elevated urinary free-cortisol level and undetectable ACTH level (< 5 pg/mL). No suppression was observed in both the low- and high-dose dexamethasone suppression tests. Adrenal computed tomography revealed bilateral adrenal masses. Adrenal venous sampling was performed, and the right-to-left lateralisation ratio was 14. 29. The finding from <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> with NP- 59 was consistent with right adrenal adenoma.

40|$|Our {{studies of}} {{patients}} with hyperandrogenism indicate that dexamethasone-suppression (DS) <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> {{can be used to}} identify those patients in whom the adrenal glands are a con tributing source of androgens (1). Three patterns of imaging have been identified: early unilateral ( 5 days) after 6 -[' 31 ljiodomethyl- 19 -norcholesterol (NP- 59) injection. Adrenal-vein catheterization in the groups with early unilateral and bilateral imaging patterns confirms androgen hypersecretion. Using the method of Koral and Sarkar, evaluation of the in vivo uptake of NP- 59 in these patient groups allows their separation (2). The NP- 59 adrenal gland up take was higher in the early-imaging groups, both bilateral and unilateral, than in the normal (late-imaging) group (p < 0. 05) (3). In addition, the calculated uptake is correlated with the level of 24 -hr urinary ketosteroid excretion in the bilateral and unilateral imaging groups.

40|$|SUMMARY We {{report a}} case of primary aldosteronism in a 30 -year-old woman without hyperten-sion or any other {{characteristic}} symptoms. The condition was first suspected by hypokalemia (2. 6 mEq/liter), which was incidentally found by routine checkup. There was evidence of suppressed plasma renin activity (PRA) and elevated plasma aldosterone levels. However, the blood pressure never reached a hypertensive level, and the circulating blood volume was within a normal range. A functioning right adrenal tumor was diagnosed by <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy,</b> computerized x-ray tomog-raphy, and adrenal venography.

40|$|A rare type of aldosteronism, {{known as}} {{unilateral}} adrenal hyperplasia (UAH), {{is difficult to}} diagnose, {{not only because it}} fails to conform to the typical common subtypes, but also because imaging results are unreliable. We report 2 Taiwanese patients with UAH. Case 1 was a 44 -year-old man with 2 episodes of hypokalemic paralysis. Hypertension and suppressed plasma renin activity (PRA) with elevated plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) were observed. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a right adrenal mass, but <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> revealed no definite laterality. The patient underwent a laparoscopic right adrenalectomy. Adrenal cortical hyperplasia was discovered from results of the histologic analysis. Case 2 was a 33 -year-old woman referred for hypokalemia, hypertension, and a left adrenal mass found on a CT scan. However, MRI revealed normal adrenal glands. The adrenal vein sampling for PAC showed overproduction of PAC from the left adrenal gland. A laparoscopic left adrenalectomy was done. Pathology results revealed micronodular cortical hyperplasia with central hemorrhage. Blood pressure, plasma potassium, aldosterone, and renin activity levels returned to normal after operation in both cases. Both patients have been well for 3 years and 16 months, respectively, after surgery. We review the literature and discuss the limitations of imaging studies...|$|E
40|$|Primary aldosteronism (PA) is {{characterized}} by hypertension, suppressed plasma renin activity, and excessive secretion of aldosterone. The diagnosis of PA consists of two steps, (1) screening of PA among hypertensive patients and (2) determination of laterality of excessive aldosterone secretion. Plasma aldosterone concentration/plasma renin activity ratio (ARR) is the most reliable method of screening for PA. Although ARR > 20 - 30 has been widely used for screening of PA, sustained suppression of plasma renin concentration under furosemide loading with upright posture should be confirmed for definitive diagnosis of PA. In the second step of PA diagnosis, adrenal CT scan, ^ I-adosterol <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy,</b> and urinary 18 -hydroxycortisol measurements as well as ACTH-loading adrenal venous sampling (AVS) are performed for diagnosis of laterality. The AVS is useful in PA cases showing bilateral adrenal tumors, unilateral or bilateral micronodules, or normal CT scan. For PA cases with unilateral hypodense adrenal mass, results of other tests should be considered for indication of AVS. In addition, ACTH loading as well as basal values should also be performed upon AVS to minimize false-positive and false-negative modulations. To evaluate results of AVS, aldosterone/cortisol (A/C) ratio in {{the right and left}} adrenal veins should be compared to that in the inferior vena cava (IVC). The ACTH-loading AVS is a very powerful method to determine which side of the adrenals excrete excessive aldosterone; however, there are still limitations for differentiate laterality, therefore, comprehensive evaluation including other test is required...|$|E
40|$|<b>Adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> using 131 I- 6 -beta-iodomethyl- 19 -norcholesterol or 6 -methyl- 75 Se-methyl- 19 -norcholesterol is a function-dependent {{imaging method}} which, in {{association}} with high-resolution spatial imaging techniques, plays {{an essential role in}} the study of adrenocortical hyperfunction. It can distinguish between bilateral cortical hyperplasia and monolateral adenoma or carcinoma and can lateralise the adenoma. In patients with Cushing syndrome, in addition to allowing a distinction to be made between ACTH-dependent forms and independent forms, adrenocortical scintigraphy is particularly appropriate to identify non-common forms of adenomatous hyperplasia. Adrenocortical scintigraphy, performed during dexamethasone administration, is an accurate mean of differentiating bilateral adrenal hyperplasia from monolateral forms (adenoma or carcinoma) in patients with Conn's syndrome. Owing to the gradual spread of high-resolution spatial imaging techniques, the problem of the diagnostic classification of so-called "incidentalomas" (clinically silent masses discovered by chance) is a subject of considerable interest. Adreno-cortical scintigraphy appears to be able to provide an important contribution to identifying the functional behaviour of these tumours. Since the early 80 s meta-iodobenzyl-guanidine (MIBG), marked with 131 I or 123 I, with a structure similar to norepinephrine and characterized by selective tropism for sympathetic and chromaffin tissue, has been used for the scintigraphic study of adrenal medulla. MIBG scintigraphy {{has been found to be}} particularly appropriate for the study of intra- and extra-adrenal, single and multiple, benign and malignant pheochromocytomas. This method has a high overall sensitivity and specificity. Lastly, MIBG scintigraphy is useful in the study of neuroblastoma...|$|E
40|$|In this study, 35 {{patients}} (11 men and 24 women, {{mean age}} 47 +/- 16 years) with unilateral adrenal masses underwent nor-cholesterol (nor-Chol) (n = 11), metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) (n = 15) or nor-Chol and MIBG (n = 9) radionuclide studies. In all patients Magnetic Resonance (MR) adrenal imaging was also performed. In 19 (54 %) patients, no laboratory abnormalities of adrenal function were observed. In the other 16 (46 %) patients, adrenal hyperfunction was found. In 21 lesions, histology showed 10 pheochromocytomas (Pheos), 6 adenomas, 3 metastases, 1 cyst and 1 nodular focal liver hyperplasia. In the remaining 14 lesions, increased cortisol (n = 4) or aldosterone (n = 2) levels and/or intense nor-Chol uptake (n = 14) were considered suggestive of adenoma. Diagnostic {{accuracy of both}} nor-Chol and MIBG radionuclide studies in correctly identifying adenoma or Pheos was 100 %. Conversely, qualitative MR signal intensity (SI) analysis on T 2 -weighted images did not allow to accurately distinguish lesions of different nature. In particular, 10 Pheos, 8 adenomas, 3 mestastasis and 1 cyst clearly showed on T 2 -weighted images higher SI than the liver; 5 adenomas had a slight higher SI; the remaining lesions (7 adenomas and 1 liver hyperplasia) exhibited low SI. In conclusion, <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> using nor-Chol or MIBG allows to identify adenomas and Pheos, respectively.

40|$|Incidentally {{discovered}} adrenal masses, or adrenal incidentalomas, {{have become}} a common clinical problem owing to wide application of radiologic imaging techniques. This definition encompasses a heterogeneous spectrum of pathologic entities, including primary adrenocortical and medullary tumors, benign or malignant lesions, hormonally active or inactive lesions, metastases, and infections. Once an adrenal mass is detected, the clinician needs to address two crucial questions: is the mass malignant, and is it hormonally active? This article {{provides an overview of}} the diagnostic clinical approach and management of the adrenal incidentaloma. Mass size is the most reliable variable to distinguish benign and malignant adrenal masses. Adrenalectomy should be recommended for masses greater than 4. 0 cm because of the increased risk of malignancy. <b>Adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> has proved useful in discriminating between benign and malignant lesions. Finally, fine-needle aspiration biopsy is an important tool in the evaluation of oncological patients and it may be useful in establishing the presence of metastatic disease. The majority of adrenal incidentalomas are non-hypersecretory cortical adenomas but an endocrine evaluation can lead to the identification of a significant number of cases with subclinical Cushing's syndrome (5 - 15 %), pheochromocytoma (1. 5 - 13 %) and aldosteronoma (0 - 7 %). The first step of hormonal screening should include an overnight low dose dexamethasone suppression test, the measure of urinary catecholamines or metanephrines, serum potassium and, in hypertensive patients, upright plasma aldosterone/plasma renin activity ratio.

We found 13 patients with a unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma (11 on the left and 2 on the right side), 6 with idiopathic hyper-aldosteronism and 8 with primary hypertension, which in two cases was associated with a nonfunctioning adrenal adenoma. The diagnosis of aldosterone-producing adenoma was confirmed at surgery and pathology in all cases. Idiopathic hyper-aldosteronism was diagnosed {{on the basis of the}} results of dexamethasone-suppressed <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> and/or selective adrenal vein sampling. MRI correctly identified all cases of aldosterone-producing adenoma, but gave false positive results in five cases: one had idiopathic hyper-aldosteronism with bilateral nodular hyperplasia and four primary hypertension, which in two patients was associated with a nonfunctioning adrenal adenoma. Therefore, the sensitivity of MRI was 100 %, its specificity 64 % and overall diagnostic accuracy 81 %. In comparison, CT correctly recognized only eight of the 13 patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma and gave false positive results in three primary hypertensives, including the two patients with a nonfunctioning adrenal adenoma. Therefore, its sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 62, 77 and 69 %, respectively. Based on these results, it could be anticipated that about four of every ten patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma would not be correctly diagnosed by CT.

40|$|The role of <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> in the noninvasive {{characterization}} of silent adrenal masses {{was investigated in}} 40 patients. The mass had been detected by US or CT performed {{in the evaluation of}} non-malignant extra-adrenal diseases (25 cases) or during staging or follow-up of a malignant extra-adrenal neoplasm (15 cases). In all cases radio-cholesterol scintigraphy (74 MBq i. v. of 131 I- 6 beta-iodomethylnorcholesterol in 19 cases; 11 MBq i. v. of 75 Se- 6 beta-selenomethylnorcholesterol in 21 cases) was performed; in 7 cases also 131 I-MIBG scan (18. 5 - 37 MBq i. v.) was carried out. When compared with CT data, radiocholesterol scintigraphy (standard or after suppression with dexamethasone) showed: concordant uptake (increased uptake of radiocholesterol {{on the side of the}} adrenal mass) in 24 / 26 patients with adrenal cortical adenoma; discordant uptake (absent or decreased uptake on the side of the adrenal mass) in 12 patients: 5 with adrenal metastases and 7 with non-adenomatous benign space-occupying lesions (2 ganglioneuromas, 1 post-traumatic hemorrhagic lesion, 3 adrenal cysts, 1 myelolipoma); indeterminate uptake (symmetric bilateral uptake) in 4 patients: 2 with a small adenoma, 1 with adrenal metastasis and 1 with a "false incidentaloma" (hepatic regenerative nodule). The results confirm the utility of radiocholesterol scintigraphy in demonstrating the benignity of adrenal lesions (particularly in identifying adrenocortical adenomas) and assess its place among the procedures used to characterize silent adrenal masses. The possible use of MIBG scintigraphy is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Adrenocortical tumours are {{frequently}} detected {{due to increased}} use of imaging techniques like computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound. The majority of the patients have tumours {{that do not have}} any overproduction of hormone. The functional adrenocortical adenomas are characterized by overproduction of one of the corticosteroids aldosterone, cortisol or androgen. The most common are aldosteronoma and cortisol producing adenoma. It is not possible to differentiate aldosterone and cortisol producing adenoma by histopathological examination. Thus, the clinical data and determination of steroid hormones in blood and urine form the basis to conclude if the extirpated tumour has been functional. The aim {{of the study was to}} increase our knowledge of the pathophysiology of adrenocortical lesions. Paper I. An in situ-hybridisation method was developed to use radioactively labelled oligonucleotide probes on paraffin embedded tissue material to demonstrate the gene expression of the steroid synthesizing enzymes and thereby identify the steroid production of adrenocortical adenoma. In vitro release of aldosterone and cortisol from thin slices was compared to the mRNA expression of CYP 11 B 2, CYP 11 B 1 and CYP 17, which are coding for the specific enzymes needed for the aldosterone and cortisol synthesis. The results indicate that CYP 11 B 2 expression reflects aldosterone production in the tumour, while CYP 17 and CYP 11 B 1 reflects cortisol production. Paper II. The most common forms of primary aldosteronism are unilateral adenoma and bilateral hyperplasia. To attain an optimal treatment there is a demand for thorough functional characterization since adrenalectomy often cures patients with adenoma while patients with hyperplasia are treated medically. To improve the subclassification of primary aldosteronism 27 operated patients were evaluated. CYP 11 B 2 expression was found in an adenoma from 22 patients. Fourteen of these had additional CYP 11 B 2 expression in zona glomerulosa. All these 22 patients were cured from hyperaldosteronism. Three patients, who were not cured, had probably bilateral disease. Two adrenal adenoma had no CYP 11 B 2 expression, but the patients were cured. These results contribute to entirely new possibilities to, postoperatively, determine a correct subclassification of patients with primary aldosteronism. Paper III. The value of <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> in lateralisation of aldosterone producing adrenocortical adenoma was investigated in 33 patients, who were evaluated according to cure and compared to the scintigraphic pattern. Twenty-seven patients had scintigraphic images showing a unilateral uptake or a bilateral asymmetric uptake indicating unilateral aldosterone overproduction. Twenty-two of these patients were cured, 3 patients were improved, and 2 patients were not cured. Six patients had no uptake at scintigraphy. <b>Adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> at primary aldosteronism may be a useful complement at the preoperative lateralisation. Paper IV. The majority of adrenocortical incidentaloma are non-hyperfunctioning adrenal adenoma. Some of them may have autonomous cortisol production not fully restrained by the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal-axis. The median ratio of CYP 17 to CYP 11 B 1 expression for tumours from patients with Cushing´s syndrome was significantly higher than the median ratio for the non-hyperfunctioning tumours. In patients with subclinical Cushing´s syndrome the tumours have a similar high ratio indicating that these patients may be identified with this method...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To compare nor-cholesterol (nor-Chol) uptake and {{magnetic}} resonance (MR) signal intensity ratios (SIRs) in characterizing adrenal adenomas to differentiate hypersecreting from non-hypersecreting lesions. Methods: We studied 34 patients (14 M and 20 F, mean age 47 ± 15 years) with hypersecreting (n= 19) or non-hypersecreting (n= 15) adrenal adenomas; all patients underwent iodine- 131 nor-Chol scintigraphy and MR studies. Pathology (n= 26) or follow-up data (n= 8) were obtained. Imaging studies were qualitatively evaluated to calculate diagnostic accuracy of each test; radionuclide studies were also semi-quantitatively evaluated using a 4 -point score to measure nor-Chol uptake, while MR scans were quantitatively assessed measuring SIRs of adrenal lesions; imaging data were then compared between hypersecreting and non-hypersecreting adenomas. Results: The diagnostic accuracies of nor-chol (100 %) and MR (95 %) scans to identify adrenal adenomas were similar; however, while a significantly (p= 0. 01) higher nor-chol uptake {{was observed in}} hypersecreting (2. 8 + 0. 5) adenomas compared to non-hypersecreting (2. 2 + 0. 6) lesions, {{no significant differences in}} SIRs were found in this comparative analysis; in this regard, no significant difference in tumor size (cm) occurred between hypersecreting (2. 7 + 0. 5) and non-hypersecreting (3. 1 + 0. 9) adenomas. Conclusion: <b>Adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> using nor-chol and MR are both able to accurately identify cortical adenomas; however, while semi-quantitative analysis of nor-chol uptake is effective to differentiate between hypersecreting and non-hypersecreting adenomas, SIRs evaluation is not useful for this purpose; in particular, the lower nor-chol uptake observed in non-hypersecreting adenomas might reflect the normal hormone synthesis status of these lesions and, thus, regular secretion; this finding could also reflect initial adrenal dysfunction responsible of sub-clinical disorders...|$|E
40|$|Incidentally {{discovered}} adrenal masses (incidentalomas) {{are relatively}} frequent and unsuspected incidentalomas (AI) {{of more than}} 1 cm in size {{may be found in}} 1 - 5 % of patients who have undergone abdominal or chest computed tomography (CT) -scan for unrelated reasons. Once an AI is detected, the two major questions are whether the patient has biochemical evidence of adrenal hyperfunction, and whether the mass is an adrenal metastasis or a malignant adrenal tumour. In most cases (> 90 %) AI are non-functioning, with a low (< 10 %) risk of being malignant, and an estimated cumulative risk of malignant transformation of less than 1 : 1000. However, all patients with non-functioning AI usually undergo several imaging studies, but the impact of imaging techniques and image-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) on the cost-effectiveness in the management of patients is not well established. A single test for disease probabilities is not always more cost-effective than two-test approaches and {{it has been shown that}} the cumulative sensitivity and accuracy of both FNAC + magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and FNAC + norcholesterol <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> reach 100 %, at a similar cost-to-accuracy ratio (7. 5 vs. 7. 0), whilst the strategy CT-scan + MRI together is less sensitive at a lower cost-to-accuracy ratio.

However, image-guided FNAC in conjunction with MRI as the exclusive imaging test has the major role and cost-effectiveness in the management of patients with AL, and should be considered the strategy of choice in distinguishing between benign and malignant non-functioning adrenal masses of more than 2 cm in diamete...|$|E
