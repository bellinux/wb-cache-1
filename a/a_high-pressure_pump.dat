The valves continue to operate, in order to pump cooling air through the cylinders. The cooling system was designed to maintain an ideal engine temperature even when subjected to a prolonged 15 percent gradient in 46 °C (115 °F) weather.

It used a mid/rear-mounted Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection V8, shared with the 308 GTBi/GTSi, mounted transversely. The engine used in the 1973 Dino 308 GT4.

5000|$|In {{common rail}} systems, <b>a</b> <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pump</b> stores a {{reservoir}} of fuel at high pressure — up to and above [...] The term [...] "common rail" [...] refers {{to the fact that}} all of the fuel injectors are supplied by a common fuel rail which {{is nothing more than a}} pressure accumulator where the fuel is stored at high pressure. This accumulator supplies multiple fuel injectors with high-pressure fuel. This simplifies the purpose of the high-pressure pump in that it only needs to maintain a commanded pressure at a target (either mechanically or electronically controlled). The fuel injectors are typically ECU-controlled. When the fuel injectors are electrically activated, a hydraulic valve (consisting of a nozzle and plunger) is mechanically or hydraulically opened and fuel is sprayed into the cylinders at the desired pressure. Since the fuel pressure energy is stored remotely and the injectors are electrically actuated, the injection pressure at the start and end of injection is very near the pressure in the accumulator (rail), thus producing a square injection rate. If the accumulator, pump and plumbing are sized properly, the injection pressure and rate will be the same for each of the multiple injection events.|$|E

A comparison was made for operating the mass spectrometer in the MS 2 and MS 3 modes for detection of the peptides. In standard solutions, the detection limits were similar at 1 – 2 pM (2 – 4 amol injected); however, the reproducibility was improved with MS 3 as the relative standard deviation was < 5 % compared with 20 % for MS 2 for 60 pM samples. For dialysate solutions, reconstructed ion chromatograms and tandem mass spectra had much higher signal-to-noise ratios in the MS 3 mode, resulting in more confident detection at in vivo concentrations.

For pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals active ingredients like antioxidants are of special interest. Traditionally these extracts are obtained by water or organic solvent extraction. Afterwards the liquid extracts are dried with classical spray drying techniques or freeze drying. In this work a new process for the gentle drying of natural extracts is presented. The process {{is based on a}} high-pressure spray technique called particles from gas saturated solutions (PGSS).

The solvent can be withdrawn with the expanded carbon dioxide and finally a dry powder of the extract is obtained. Like the most supercritical fluid processes the drying is carried out at low temperature (30 - 60 °C) and in an inert, oxygen-free atmosphere. This makes the process very promising for sensitive substances. First investigations with this technique were made with green tea extracts, which contain antioxidants polyphenols.

40|$|The first {{derivative}} of intraventricular pressure (dp/dt) reflects {{the rate of}} development of tension in the myocardium and has been employed as an index of contractility. The peak dp/dt of left ventricular (LV) pressure in the normal heart {{is higher than the}} right ventricular (RV) peak dp/dt. It is not known whether this is related to the basic difference in the architecture of the ventricular muscle or to the disparity in wall thickness. Rushmer (1961) has demonstrated by cinefluorographic studies that the mechanism by which the two ventricles eject blood is different, and concludes that the architectural design of the right ventricle is ideally suited to the ejection of large volumes of blood with a minimal amount of myocardial shortening and is not con-ducive to the development of high intraventricular pressures; the left ventricle, on the other hand, was felt to be designed as <b>a</b> <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pump.</b> The essential architectural difference relates to the orientation of muscle fibres. In order to test the validity of these teleological explanations for anatomical differences, it would be necessary to test some parameters of ventricular function under circumstances where the function of the ventricles is reversed. Nature has provided precisely this situation in patients with complete transposition of great vessels, where the anatomical right ventricle faces the high pressure/high resistance systemic circuit and the anatomical left ventricle faces a pulmonary circuit that has a variable re-sistance. It was decided to study the ventricular pressures and their first derivative in cases of com-plete transposition of the great vessels with normally related ventricles, as shown by angiocardiography...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAmong {{the most}} {{important}} tropical fruit grown {{in the world today}} and in Brazil, papaya occupies a prominent place. Native to tropical America, papaya has spread to several regions of the world, and Brazil accounts for 12. 74 % of the world production, followed by Mexico, Nigeria and India. The culture reached a harvested area of 441, 042 ha and production of 12, 420, 585 t worldwide. The largest interest in this fruit relies on its main constituent compounds, like vitamins A, B and C, alkaloids (carpaine and pseudocarpaine), proteolytic enzymes (papain and quimiopapain) and benzyl isothiocyanate, more known as BITC, which has anthelmintic activity. Because of that, the present work has as objective the evaluation of the efficiency and composition of the oil extracted from Carica papaya L. seeds with supercritical carbon dioxide. The experiments were performed in a unit containing mainly <b>a</b> <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pump</b> and a stainless steel extractor with 42 mL of volume.

They consist of three west-east transects from 170 °E to 180 ° longitude along the AESOPS study line at 76. 5 °S and three short north-south transects in the Ross Sea polynya during the initial and maturing stages of phytoplankton blooms in the austral {{spring and early summer}} of 1997. The LPS carried an in situ instrument array for measurement of temperature, salinity, fluorescence, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and dissolved oxygen. In addition, <b>a</b> <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pump</b> mounted aboard the LPS fish delivered a continuous seawater sample stream to the shipboard laboratory for high-speed analysis of its nutrient (nitrate plus nitrate, phosphate, and silicate) and total CO₂ concentrations and CO₂ partial pressure (Pco₂). Vertical resolution of this sampling equaled or exceeded that of hydrostation-style conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) casts; horizontal resolution (nominally equal to a vertical cast every 3 – 5 km) exceeded station resolution by a factor of 10. While not perfectly synoptic, the 20 -hour duration of these transects is far shorter than the time typically taken to complete the line with conventional sampling methods. These surveys clearly identified three distinct deep water masses below about 100 m: High-Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW) in the western end of the transects, Modified Circumpolar Deep Water (MCDW) {{in the middle of the}} transects, and Low-Salinity Shelf Water (LSSW) to the east. The regions to the west were characterized by high biological productivity with high N:P and C:P uptake ratios, but little Si uptake, indicating that the production was dominated by Phaeocystis. To the east, biological productivity was lower than in the west, and low N:P and C:P uptake ratios and high Si uptake indicated the dominance of diatoms. The difference in uptake ratios appears to be entirely due to anomalously high P uptake by diatoms; N:C uptake ratios are similar in the two regions and very near canonical Redfield stoichiometry. The area in the center of the transects was characterized by high stratification and low, diatom-dominated productivity; the reason for this low productivity is unclear but is speculated to be due to the short time which this water has been exposed to an ice-free surface. The presence of strong variability at horizontal length scales of order 10 km is evident in nearly all fields especially in upper 100 m, although many of the features are resolved only by two or three LPS tracks (each separated by only a few kilometers).
