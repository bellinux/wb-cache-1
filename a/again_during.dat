Critics generally praised the album's expressive music and harmolodic approach, but it made little commercial impact and went out of print. Coleman enlisted his son Denardo as manager after a dispute with his former managers over the album's royalties, a change that inspired him to perform publicly <b>again</b> <b>during</b> the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to appearing as the small {{figure of a}} woman in A Golden Hour, Deborah Vernon Hackett was also the subject of a portrait, painted around 1908, <b>again</b> <b>during</b> Fuller's time in Perth.
