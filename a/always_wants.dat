500|$|... It's a {{theme that}} runs {{throughout}} her career. [...] She's not afraid of being hard. [...] He [...] and Madonna were friends. If he were alive, {{it would be his}} 50th birthday as well. So I thought, 'What if we revisited that?' Riccardo's a new young talent. If you look at Madonna's history with fashion, that makes him an obvious choice. [...] <b>always</b> <b>wants</b> to push the envelope. There are no vanity considerations based on her age." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Behind the Crooked Cross" [...] {{is rarely}} played live as Hanneman hates the track, though King has {{always wanted to}} play it [...] "because it's got a cool intro" [...] despite it not being his {{favorite}} song. King said [...] "that's fine" [...] when speaking of the situation, noting [...] "there are songs {{that he wants to}} play that I always shoot down". [...] "Ghosts of War" [...] isn't King's favorite song either, which he attests [...] "everybody <b>always</b> <b>wants</b> to hear" [...] performed live. He confessed; [...] "I like the ending, you know, I like the big heavy part and I always say, 'Let's put the heavy ending at the end of [...] "Chemical Warfare" [...] and just do the last half.' But I could never make that fly." ...|$|E
500|$|Bob Bowman {{took over}} as head coach of Michigan for the 2004–05 season. [...] He put Tarwater on a new {{training}} program, with a greater focus on speed training and less on distance. [...] "We've also put him through weight training, and I think it's been improving his speed", Bowman said. [...] "He {{has a very strong}} work ethic and <b>always</b> <b>wants</b> to improve. Instead of just getting in the pool and doing what we tell him to do, he actually thinks about it and asks questions. He wants to know the theory behind what he's doing." [...] Tarwater won the 2005 NCAA championship in the 200-yard butterfly. [...] His time of 1:42.30 was a Michigan and Big Ten record, and the third fastest time in NCAA history. In the 100-meter butterfly, he placed fourth.|$|E

2500|$|Death of a Salesman {{was welcomed}} in China. There, Arthur Miller {{directed}} the play himself. As Miller stated, “It {{depends on the}} father and the mother and the children. That’s what it’s about. The salesman part is what he does to stay alive. But he could be a peasant, he could be, whatever.” Here, the play focuses on the family relationship. It is easier for the Chinese public to understand the relationship between father and son because “One thing about the play that is very Chinese is the way Willy tries to make his sons successful." [...] The Chinese father <b>always</b> <b>wants</b> his sons to be ‘dragons.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|Cruyff always {{considered}} aesthetic and moral {{aspects of the}} game; {{it is not just}} about winning, but about winning with [...] "right" [...] style/way. He also always spoke highly of entertaining value of the game. The beautiful game, for him, is about as much the entertainment and joy as the results. In thinking of Cruyff, the victory is truly meaningful when it can fully capture the minds and hearts of competitors and spectators. As he once noted, [...] "Quality without results is pointless. Results without quality is boring,". For Cruyff and the Cruyffistas (Cruyff's devout followers), to choose a [...] "right" [...] style of play to win is even more important than winning itself. Cruyff always believed in simplicity. He sees simplicity and beauty as inseparable. [...] "Simple football is the most beautiful. But playing simple football is the hardest thing," [...] as Cruyff once summed up his fundamental philosophy. [...] "How often do you see a pass of forty meters when twenty meters is enough?... To play well, you need good players, but a good player almost always has the problem of a lack of efficiency. He <b>always</b> <b>wants</b> to do things prettier than strictly necessary." [...] Cruyff also perfected a feint now known as the [...] "Cruyff Turn". The feint {{is an example of the}} simplicity in Cruyff's football philosophy. It was neither carried out to embarrass the opponent nor to excite the watching crowd, but because Cruyff estimated that it was the simplest method (in terms of effort and risk versus expected result) to beat his opponent. Cruyff looked to pass or cross the ball, then, instead of kicking it, he dragged the ball behind his planted foot with the inside of his other foot, turned through 180 degrees, and accelerated away. As Sweden defender Jan Olsson (a [...] "victim" [...] of the Cruyff Turn at the 1974 World Cup) recalled, [...] "I played 18 years in top football and seventeen times for Sweden but that moment against Cruyff was the proudest moment of my career. I thought I'd win the ball for sure, but he tricked me. I was not humiliated. I had no chance. Cruyff was a genius." [...] With its high effectiveness and unpredictability, the Cruyff Turn remains one of the most commonly used dribbling moves in modern football.|$|E
