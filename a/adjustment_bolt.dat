5000|$|The {{truss rod}} tension is usually {{controlled}} using an <b>adjustment</b> <b>bolt</b> (a hex nut or allen key). Depending {{on the model}} of guitar, this bolt can be located: ...|$|E
50|$|Usually, the {{truss rod}} of a brand-new {{instrument}} is adjusted {{by the manufacturer}} before sale. Normally, turning the truss rod's <b>adjustment</b> <b>bolt</b> clockwise tightens it, counteracting the tension of the strings and straightening the neck or creating a backward bow. Turning the bolt counter-clockwise loosens it, allowing string tension {{to act on the}} neck and creating a forward bow (higher string action).|$|E
50|$|After the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) {{announced}} {{their desire for}} a new Precision Sniper Rifle in December 2009, Barrett created the MRAD {{in accordance with the}} specifications laid out by SOCOM. Building off of the successful Barrett 98B, the MRAD features multiple improvements such as a folding stock which allows the rifle to be transported more easily. When folded, the stock latches around the bolt handle which increases the security of transporting the rifle. Additional features of the MRAD include a single-button length-of-pull <b>adjustment,</b> a <b>bolt</b> guide which acts as a dust cover to reduce debris entering the action, a trigger module which can be removed without tools making cleaning easier, an ambidextrous magazine release, and the ability to accept standard M4/M16 pistol grips.|$|R
50|$|The stem, of the quill variety, is {{attached}} to the fork's steerer tube using an expander bolt which fits through the stem from the top with a wedge at the bottom, the stem fits inside the steerer tube and can be adjusted to the correct height without disturbing the headset. To free the stem for <b>adjustment,</b> undo the <b>bolt</b> {{on the top of the}} stem a couple of turns and give the bolt a sharp tap to disengage the wedge.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{new type}} massage device {{designed}} {{is composed of}} gearing with groove cam mechanism, executive links with double-rocker mechanism, rate <b>adjustment</b> device with <b>bolts,</b> slider and compression springs. The device, which can simulate massage to remove fatigue by adding functions such as heating and magnetic, has broad application prospects. Structures of the massage device, kinematic analysis and the dynamic simulation have been introduced and the parameters {{on the effect of}} massage range have been studied in this paper. A prototype device has been made according to the results of the study. It has good massage effect...|$|R
40|$|The Adaptive Paddling Program at California Polytechnic State University has {{sponsored}} {{the construction of}} an adaptive kayak seat, the Tide Rider 360, to provide paddlers with disabilities sufficient trunk support while out on the water. In particular, this design focused on providing the least restrictive environment for all users while still providing sufficient lateral, neck, back, and hip support. This seat is intended for use in the quarterly Adaptive Paddling Program to allow people with disabilities to experience the joys of kayaking in the most comfortable and supportive environment possible. The following report details the background research, design development, manufacturing, and testing processes that went into designing this seat. It provides in-depth breakdowns on aspects such as the concept generation and material selection methods in order to prove that this kayak seat meets the requirements of the Adaptive Paddling Program. In particular, this seat was designed for use in marine environments with maximum levels of adjustability, support, and comfort. It was designed to fit to all different types of people in terms of weight, disability, and paddling ability. This kayak seat was manufactured out of aluminum tubing and joints, high density polyethylene sheets, and polyethylene foam. In addition to these materials, we added pre-manufactured wheelchair support components for the lateral supports, headrest, hip supports, and seat base. The total cost for the manufacturing of this prototype came out to be approximately $ 2100 and the final weight was just around 30 pounds. We conducted multiple levels of testing on the kayak seat, including a load test and in-pool assessment. Our load testing proved that the aluminum seat frame experiences minimal deflection and bending when subjected to a constant weight {{for an extended period of}} time. The in-pool testing verified that the seat is able to support a paddler while still allowing them a wide range of motion, if so desired. The prototype as is does have a few shortcomings, such as some hard to reach <b>adjustment</b> <b>bolts,</b> but the Adaptive Paddling Program still feels confident in the ability of this seat and the fulfillment of the preset requirements. We believe that with a few slight modifications to the seat back angle and some additional reach of the supports, this product would be able to change the lives of the participants in the Adaptive Paddling Program...|$|R
5000|$|The {{part that}} connects the rails to the seat post {{is known as the}} [...] "saddle clamp". It may be built into the top of the seat post, or the seat post may be {{essentially}} a pipe that provides a cylinder at the top (often â…ž in / 22.2 mm) for a separate clamp to attach. The upper attachment point must be compatible with the rail configuration (though the two-rail 7 mm round configuration is very common), and the lower attachment point must match the diameter of the seat post if not built in. The shape of some unusual saddles also makes them physically incompatible with certain seat posts, clamps, or frames, due to bumping into other parts or blocking <b>adjustment</b> or attachment <b>bolts.</b>|$|R
