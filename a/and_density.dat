For example, in: industrial and extractive metallurgy, surface treatments such as plasma spraying (coating), etching in microelectronics, metal cutting and welding; {{as well as}} in everyday vehicle exhaust cleanup and fluorescent/luminescent lamps, while even playing a part in supersonic combustion engines for aerospace engineering.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{consisting}} {{mostly of}} hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn's mass {{is not in}} the gas phase, because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid when the density is above 0.01g/cm3, which is reached at a radius containing 99.9% of Saturn's mass. The temperature, pressure, <b>and</b> <b>density</b> inside Saturn all rise steadily toward the core, which causes hydrogen to be a metal in the deeper layers.|$|E

5|$|In {{experimental}} particle physics, liquid krypton is used {{to construct}} quasi-homogeneous electromagnetic calorimeters. A notable example is the calorimeter of the NA48 experiment at CERN containing about 27 tonnes of liquid krypton. This usage is rare, since liquid argon is less expensive. The advantage of krypton is a smaller Molière radius of 4.7cm, which provides excellent spatial resolution with little overlapping. The other parameters relevant for calorimetry are: radiation length of X0=4.7cm, <b>and</b> <b>density</b> of 2.4 g/cm3.|$|E
5|$|Plasma and ionised gases have unique {{properties}} and display behaviors unlike {{those of the}} other states, and the transition between them is mostly a matter of nomenclature and subject to interpretation. Based on the surrounding environmental temperature <b>and</b> <b>density,</b> partially ionised or fully ionised forms of plasma may be produced. Neon signs or lightning storms are examples of partially ionised plasma, while the interior of the Sun is an example of fully ionised plasma, along with the solar corona and stars.|$|E

5|$|Wet snow {{avalanches}} are a low-velocity {{suspension of}} snow and water, with the flow confined {{to the surface of}} the pathway. The low speed of travel is due to the friction between the sliding surface of the pathway and the water saturated flow.

At this point, the Sun became a main-sequence star. The main-sequence phase, from beginning to end, will last about 10 billion years for the Sun compared to around two billion years for all other phases of the Sun's pre-remnant life combined. Solar wind from the Sun created the heliosphere and swept away the remaining gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar space, ending the planetary formation process. The Sun is growing brighter; early in its main-sequence life its brightness was 70% that of what it is today.|$|E
5|$|All main-sequence {{stars have}} a core region where energy is {{generated}} by nuclear fusion. The temperature <b>and</b> <b>density</b> of this core are at the levels necessary to sustain the energy production that will support {{the remainder of the}} star. A reduction of energy production would cause the overlaying mass to compress the core, resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise an increase in energy production would cause the star to expand, lowering the pressure at the core. Thus the star forms a self-regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime.|$|E

5|$|Breeds {{are often}} {{categorized}} by {{the type of}} their wool. Fine wool breeds are those that have wool of great crimp <b>and</b> <b>density,</b> which are preferred for textiles. Most of these were derived from Merino sheep, and the breed continues to dominate the world sheep industry. Downs breeds have wool between the extremes, and are typically fast-growing meat and ram breeds with dark faces. Some major medium wool breeds, such as the Corriedale, are dual-purpose crosses of long and fine-wooled breeds and were created for high-production commercial flocks. Long wool breeds are the largest of sheep, with long wool and a slow rate of growth. Long wool sheep are most valued for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other sheep types. For example: the American Columbia breed was developed by crossing Lincoln rams (a long wool breed) with fine-wooled Rambouillet ewes.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s the {{downtown}} area experienced a resurgence, {{with a level of}} construction activity not seen again until the urban real estate boom of the 2000s. By the end of the decade, Phoenix adopted the Phoenix Concept 2000 plan which split the city into urban villages, each with its own village core where greater height <b>and</b> <b>density</b> was permitted, further shaping the free-market development culture. Originally, there were nine villages, but this has been expanded to 15 over the years (see Cityscape below). This officially turned Phoenix into a city of many nodes, which would later be connected by freeways. The Phoenix Symphony Hall opened in 1972; other major structures which saw construction downtown during this decade were the First National Bank Plaza, the Valley Center (the tallest building in the state of Arizona) and the Arizona Bank building.|$|E

5|$|Later, between 2009 and 2011, {{another team}} of astronomers {{observed}} WASP-13b and WASP-21b {{to find what}} caused some Hot Jupiters to have anomalously high radii. The RISE photometric camera on the Liverpool Telescope was used to detect further transits. Two partial transits and two full transits were observed during this period, although the quality of both full transits was slightly compromised because of passing cloud cover. The collected observations, along with the JGT observations {{that were used to}} confirm the planet, were scaled to filter out errors such as background noise. The data was then used to re-define WASP-13b's parameters, including its age, mass, radius, <b>and</b> <b>density.</b> The study also noted that a limb darkening effect was present, a characteristic that may affect future atmospheric studies of the planet.|$|E
5|$|Once {{diamonds}} {{have been}} {{transported to the}} surface by magma in a volcanic pipe, they may erode out and be distributed over a large area. A volcanic pipe containing diamonds {{is known as a}} primary source of diamonds. Secondary sources of diamonds include all areas where a significant number of diamonds have been eroded out of their kimberlite or lamproite matrix, and accumulated because of water or wind action. These include alluvial deposits and deposits along existing and ancient shorelines, where loose diamonds tend to accumulate because of their size <b>and</b> <b>density.</b> Diamonds have also rarely been found in deposits left behind by glaciers (notably in Wisconsin and Indiana); in contrast to alluvial deposits, glacial deposits are minor and are therefore not viable commercial sources of diamond.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} Big Bang, {{primordial}} protons and neutrons formed from the quark–gluon plasma {{of the early}} Universe as it cooled below two trillion degrees. A few minutes later, in {{a process known as}} Big Bang nucleosynthesis, nuclei formed from the primordial protons and neutrons. This nucleosynthesis formed lighter elements, those with small atomic numbers up to lithium and beryllium, but the abundance of heavier elements dropped off sharply with increasing atomic number. Some boron may have been formed at this time, but the next heavier element, carbon, was not formed in significant amounts. Big Bang nucleosynthesis shut down after about 20 minutes due to the rapid drop in temperature <b>and</b> <b>density</b> of the expanding Universe. Subsequent formation of heavier elements resulted from stellar nucleosynthesis and supernova nucleosynthesis.|$|E

As part of a major initiative to improve its grain Fe <b>and</b> Zn <b>densities,</b> two sets of line × tester studies were conducted. Results showed that the underlying physiological processes determining the grain Fe <b>and</b> Zn <b>densities</b> were largely under additive genetic control, and Fe <b>and</b> Zn <b>densities</b> of the inbred lines per se and their general combining ability (GCA) were positively and highly significantly correlated. This would imply that recurrent selection can be effectively used to improve the breeding populations for grain Fe <b>and</b> Zn <b>densities</b> <b>and</b> that breeding lines selected for high Fe <b>and</b> Zn <b>densities</b> per se {{are more likely to}} include those with high GCA for these micronutrients.

5|$|The addax are amply {{suited to}} live in the deep desert under extreme conditions. They can survive without free water almost indefinitely, because they get {{moisture}} from their food and dew that condenses on plants. Scientists believe the addax has a special lining in its stomach that stores water in pouches to use in times of dehydration. They also produce highly concentrated urine to conserve water. Pale colour of the coat reflects radiant heat, and the length <b>and</b> <b>density</b> of the coat helps in thermoregulation. In the day the addax huddle together in shaded areas, and in cool nights rest in sand hollows. These practices help in dissipation of body heat and saving water by cooling the body through evaporation.|$|E
5|$|The current view among astronomers who model Type Ia {{supernova}} explosions, however, is {{that this}} limit is never actually attained and collapse is never initiated. Instead, the increase in pressure <b>and</b> <b>density</b> due to the increasing weight raises {{the temperature of the}} core, and as the white dwarf approaches about 99% of the limit, a period of convection ensues, lasting approximately 1,000years. At some point in this simmering phase, a deflagration flame front is born, powered by carbon fusion. The details of the ignition are still unknown, including the location and number of points where the flame begins. Oxygen fusion is initiated shortly thereafter, but this fuel is not consumed as completely as carbon.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{accepted}} coat colours, red and blue, though {{chocolate and}} cream do occur. Blue dogs can be blue, blue mottled, or blue speckled {{with or without}} black, tan, or white markings. Red dogs are evenly speckled with solid red markings. Both red dogs and blue dogs are born white (except for any solid-coloured body or face markings) and the red or black hairs grow in as they mature. The distinctive adult colouration {{is the result of}} black or red hairs closely interspersed through a predominantly white coat. This is not merle colouration (a speckled effect that has associated health issues), but rather the result of the ticking gene. A number of breeds show ticking, which is the presence of colour through white areas, though the overall effect depends on other genes that will modify the size, shape <b>and</b> <b>density</b> of the ticking.|$|E
