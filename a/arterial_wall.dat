5|$|Subarachnoid hemorrage due to {{arterial}} rupture typically occurs if the dissection extends {{into the}} V4 {{section of the}} artery. This {{may be explained by}} the fact that the <b>arterial</b> <b>wall</b> is thinner and lacks a number of structural supports in this section.|$|E
5|$|Vertebral artery {{dissection}} (VAD) is a flap-like tear of {{the inner}} lining of the vertebral artery, which {{is located in the}} neck and supplies blood to the brain. After the tear, blood enters the <b>arterial</b> <b>wall</b> and forms a blood clot, thickening the artery wall and often impeding blood flow. The symptoms of vertebral artery dissection include head and neck pain and intermittent or permanent stroke symptoms such as difficulty speaking, impaired coordination and visual loss. It is usually diagnosed with a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scan.|$|E
5|$|Spontaneous {{cases are}} {{considered}} to be caused by intrinsic factors that weaken the <b>arterial</b> <b>wall.</b> Only a very small proportion (1–4%) have a clear underlying connective tissue disorder, such as Ehlers–Danlos syndrome type 4 and more rarely Marfan's syndrome. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type 4, caused by mutations of the COL3A gene, leads to defective production of the collagen, type III, alpha 1 protein and causes skin fragility as well as weakness of the walls of arteries and internal organs. Marfan's syndrome results from mutations in the FBN1 gene, defective production of the protein fibrillin-1, and a number of physical abnormalities including aneurysm of the aortic root.|$|E

25|$|Infection. A mycotic {{aneurysm}} is an aneurysm {{that results}} from an infectious process that involves the <b>arterial</b> <b>wall.</b> A person with a mycotic aneurysm has a bacterial infection in the wall of an artery, resulting {{in the formation of}} an aneurysm. The most common locations include arteries in the abdomen, thigh, neck, and arm. A mycotic aneurysm can result in sepsis, or life-threatening bleeding if the aneurysm ruptures. Less than 3% of abdominal aortic aneurysms are mycotic aneurysms.|$|E
25|$|CABG {{is often}} {{indicated}} when coronary arteries have a 50 percent to 99 percent obstruction. The obstruction being bypassed is typically due to arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, or both. Arteriosclerosis {{is characterized by}} thickening, loss of elasticity, and calcification of the <b>arterial</b> <b>wall,</b> most often resulting in a generalized narrowing in the affected coronary artery. Atherosclerosis is characterized by yellowish plaques of cholesterol, lipids, and cellular debris deposited into the inner layer of {{the wall of a}} large or medium-sized coronary artery, most often resulting in a focal partial obstruction in the affected artery. Either condition can limit blood flow if it causes a cross-sectional narrowing of at least 50 percent.|$|E
25|$|Angiography, {{since the}} 1960s, {{has been the}} {{traditional}} way of evaluating for atheroma. However, angiography is only motion or still images of dye mixed with the blood with the arterial lumen and never show atheroma; the wall of arteries, including atheroma with the <b>arterial</b> <b>wall</b> remain invisible. The limited exception to this rule is that with very advanced atheroma, with extensive calcification within the wall, a halo-like ring of radiodensity {{can be seen in}} most older humans, especially when arterial lumens are visualized end-on. On cine-floro, cardiologists and radiologists typically look for these calcification shadows to recognize arteries before they inject any contrast agent during angiograms.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A blood {{pressure}} monitor or sphygmomanometer {{can be either}} manual or automatic, employing respectively either the auscultatory method or the oscillometric method. The manual version of the sphygmomanometer involves an inflatable cuff with a stethoscope adopted to detect the sounds generated by the <b>arterial</b> <b>walls</b> to measure {{blood pressure}} in an artery. An automatic sphygmomanometer can be effectively used to monitor blood pressure through a pressure sensor, which detects vibrations provoked by oscillations of the <b>arterial</b> <b>walls.</b> The pressure sensor implemented in this device improves {{the accuracy of the}} measurements taken.

50|$|Blood flow is also {{affected}} by the smoothness of the vessels, resulting in either turbulent (chaotic) or laminar (smooth) flow. Smoothness is reduced by the buildup of fatty deposits on the <b>arterial</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R
25|$|Murine microRNA-712 is a {{potential}} biomarker (i.e. predictor) for atherosclerosis, a cardiovascular disease of the <b>arterial</b> <b>wall</b> associated with lipid retention and inflammation. Non-laminar blood flow also correlates with development of atherosclerosis as mechanosenors of endothelial cells respond to the shear force of disturbed flow (d-flow). A number of pro-atherogenic genes including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are upregulated by d-flow , mediating pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic signals. These findings were observed in ligated carotid arteries of mice to mimic the effects of d-flow. Within 24 hours, pre-existing immature miR-712 formed mature miR-712 suggesting that miR-712 is flow-sensitive. Coinciding with these results, miR-712 is also upregulated in endothelial cells exposed tonaturally occurring d-flowin the greater curvature of the aortic arch.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} of atherosclerotic plaques {{in a part}} of arterial endothelium is inhomogeneous. The multiple and focal development of atherosclerotic changes is similar to that in the development of amyloid plaques in the brain and that of age spots on the skin. Misrepair-accumulation aging theory suggests that misrepair mechanisms {{play an important role in}} the focal development of atherosclerosis. Development of a plaque is a result of repair of injured endothelium. Because of the infusion of lipids into sub-endothelium, the repair has to end up with altered remodeling of local endothelium. This is the manifestation of a misrepair. Important is this altered remodeling makes the local endothelium have increased fragility to damage and have reduced repair-efficiency. As a consequence, this part of endothelium has increased risk to be injured and to be misrepaired. Thus, the accumulation of misrepairs of endothelium is focalized and self-accelerating. In this way, the growing of a plaque is also self-accelerating. With{{in a part of}} <b>arterial</b> <b>wall,</b> the oldest plaque is always the biggest, and is the most dangerous one to cause blockage of local artery.|$|E
25|$|Atherogenesis is the {{developmental}} process of atheromatous plaques. It {{is characterized by}} a remodeling of arteries leading to subendothelial accumulation of fatty substances called plaques. The buildup of an atheromatous plaque is a slow process, developed {{over a period of several}} years through a complex series of cellular events occurring within the <b>arterial</b> <b>wall</b> and in response to a variety of local vascular circulating factors. One recent hypothesis suggests that, for unknown reasons, leukocytes, such as monocytes or basophils, begin to attack the endothelium of the artery lumen in cardiac muscle. The ensuing inflammation leads to formation of atheromatous plaques in the arterial tunica intima, a region of the vessel wall located between the endothelium and the tunica media. The bulk of these lesions is made of excess fat, collagen, and elastin. At first, as the plaques grow, only wall thickening occurs without any narrowing. Stenosis is a late event, which may never occur and is often the result of repeated plaque rupture and healing responses, not just the atherosclerotic process by itself.|$|E

50|$|When {{looking at}} {{viscoelastic}} behavior {{of blood in}} vivo, {{it is necessary to}} also consider the effects of arteries, capillaries, and veins. The viscosity of blood has a primary influence on flow in the larger arteries, while the elasticity, which resides in the elastic deformability of red blood cells, has primary influence in the arterioles and the capillaries. Understanding wave propagation in <b>arterial</b> <b>walls,</b> local hemodynamics, and wall shear stress gradient is important in understanding the mechanisms of cardiovascular function. <b>Arterial</b> <b>walls</b> are anisotropic and heterogeneous, composed of layers with different bio-mechanical characteristics which makes understanding the mechanical influences that arteries contribute to blood flow very difficult.|$|R
25|$|Carotid IMT {{has been}} {{measured}} in numerous epidemiological and clinical studies. These have shown associations with numerous risk factors, including {{type 2 diabetes}} and impaired glucose tolerance, familial hypercholesterolemia, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides, rheumatoid arthritis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and air pollution. Since the 1990s, some small and larger scale clinical trials of lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions have also used carotid artery IMT as a surrogate endpoint for evaluating the regression and/or progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However the appropriateness of carotid IMT {{in this context is}} uncertain. Although carotid intima-media thickness is strongly associated with atherosclerosis, thickening of the intima-media may not always be due to atherosclerosis. Intima-medial thickening is a complex process, depending on a variety of factors, including local hemodynamics, blood pressure, shear stress and circumferential tensile stress. Changes in shear stress may adversely affect endothelial function and particle residence time, affecting the delivery and transport of potentially atherogenic particles into the <b>arterial</b> <b>wall</b> and consequent plaque formation. Blood pressure may affect IMT through blood vessel remodelling or wall hypertrophy in response to altered circumferential stress. Variations in IMT between different locations, such as the inflow side of branches, the inner curvature at bends and opposite the flow divider at bifurcations may reflect differences in local hemodynamic forces. However, an IMT greater than 0.9-1mm is highly likely to be indicative of atherosclerosis and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Often, the measurement of the IMT is measured in three locations: in the common carotid (typically at one cm proximal to the flow divider), at the bifurcation, and in the internal carotid artery. IMT measurements of the far (deeper) wall, by ultrasound, are generally considered more reliable than measurements performed on the near (more superficial) wall; although measurement of both near and far wall IMT has also been advocated.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{difficulties}} with coronary stents included {{a risk of}} early thrombosis (clotting) resulting in occlusion of the stent.
