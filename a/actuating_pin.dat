This "Pachinko machine" is intended as a reconfigurable parts feeder for flexible assembly. A part dropped on this device may come {{to rest on the}} <b>actuated</b> <b>pins,</b> bounce out, or fall through. We select the equilibrium part configurations by selecting the set of <b>actuated</b> <b>pins.</b> Our objective is to automatically compute pin actuation sequences that bring the part to a goal configuration, without predicting the exact part motion between equilibria. Our approach is based on constructing the capture region of each equilibrium, i. e., the maximal subset of the part's configuration space such that any motion starting within it is guaranteed to reach the equilibrium. Reorienting a part reduces to constructing a directed graph whose nodes are the equilibria and whose arcs link pairs of nodes such that the first equilibrium lies in the capture region of the second one, and then finding paths in this graph from initial to goal states. We have implemented an algorithm to generate the capture regions and these paths, and have conducted experiments on a prototype Pachinko machine. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Apart {{from the}} Japanese market-only Honda CB400SF Super Four HYPER VTEC, {{introduced}} in 1999, the first worldwide implementation of VTEC technology in a motorcycle occurred {{with the introduction}} of Honda's VFR800 sportbike in 2002.

This "Pachinko machine" is intended as a reconfigurable parts feeder for flexible assembly. A part dropped on this device may come {{to rest on the}} <b>actuated</b> <b>pins,</b> bounce out, or fall through. We propose a novel algorithm for part reorientation. Its input consists of the shape of a part, its initial position and orientation, and a goal configuration, and its output is a sequence of pin actuations that will bring the part to the goal configuration. The proposed approach does not attempt to predict the part motion between the equilibria associated with the active pins in the output sequence; instead, it constructs the capture region of each equilibrium, i. e., the maximal subset of the part's configuration space such that any motion starting within it is guaranteed to end at the equilibrium. Assuming frictionless contacts and dissipative dynamics, reorienting a part reduces to finding a path from initial to goal states in a directed graph whose nodes are the equilibria and whose arcs link pairs of nodes such that the first equilibrium lies in the capture region of the second one.

50|$|Some riders {{attach the}} kite's handle or control bar via a strap to a harness {{worn by the}} rider, {{allowing}} the rider to remove his hands from the control system {{in order to do}} tricks. The use of a harness also allows a rider to ride for a longer time, as much of the force of the kite is taken off the rider's arms. For de-powerable kites, the harness connection is used to power and de-power the kite. There are different types of harnesses (e.g., waist or seat), and selection depends on the personal preference of the rider. Some riders use specially designed snowkiting harnesses that are very similar to those used in rock climbing (or just reuse rock climbing harnesses). Because harnesses keep the rider attached to the kite, a number of safety measures have been developed. These include easily reachable safety systems <b>actuated</b> by <b>pins.</b> The pins allow the rider to release the connection between the rider and the kite when necessary. Some harnesses also have an easily accessible knife to cut the lines if necessary in an emergency.|$|R

Furthermore, using the decocking lever makes the weapon [...] "drop safe", which means the firing pin will be blocked from striking a loaded round unless the trigger is pulled.

40|$|A high {{resolution}} reconfigurable mold {{has been sought}} after for over 150 years. An ideal reconfigurable mold {{would be capable of}} producing detailed surfaces for use in molding and be capable of fast surface reconfiguration. Such a device would combine the fast speed and repeatability of formative processes, like injection molding, with the flexibility of additive processes, like 3 D printing. An affordable, {{high resolution}}, reconfigurable mold could be a practical tool for a lean, short-run shop or factory, serving as a resin mold, fixturing surface or concrete formwork; to name only a few possible applications. Resembling the common pin art toy, a discrete element pin bed has often been proposed as a design for a reconfigurable mold. Conventional actuation strategies are often cumbersome and expensive, due to the quadratic increase in number of pin elements with increasing surface resolution. Very few designs exist that are capable of producing a reconfigurable pin array at sufficiently high resolution to compete with the cost of making a fixed geometry mold. A practical pin tool, an inexpensive but high resolution molding tool, could be an asset to shops and small business everywhere, but nothing like this currently exists. This thesis presents a concise design strategy, backed up by analytical arguments and empirical evidence which can used to construct an affordable, high resolution reconfigurable pin tool. We address the challenge of quadratic scaling by edge-addressing simple, nonlinear mechanisms to <b>actuate</b> each <b>pin.</b> Edge addressing, along rows and columns of pins, reduces the number of control inputs to a small, linearly increasing value. Nonlinear mechanisms at each discrete pin site allow for a predictable, localized expression of the edge addressed inputs. Two embodiments of this design strategy are proposed and tested. First, a diode/resistive heater array allows for electrical edge addressing and control of a fusible alloy brake to grip or release targeted, sliding pins. Second, an array of screws is edge addressed by mechanical oscillations to generate nonlinear tangential forces in targeted screws, resulting in controllable screw translations. We conclude by summarizing our results and discuss directions for future work. by Benjamin J. Peters. Thesis: S.

With the early cannon installation, jamming was a serious problem. In one engagement, only two of the 12 aircraft had been able to fire off all of their ammunition. Further cannon-armed Spitfires, with improvements to the cannon mounts, were later issued to 92 Squadron, but due to the limited magazine capacity it was eventually decided the best armament mix was two cannon and four machine guns (most of these were later converted to the first Mk VBs).|$|R
40|$|Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) {{continues}} to grow in importance and to gradually change and improve the medical practice. This technique comes with great advantages, such as lower risk, fast patient recovery and a reduced hospital stay, but requires an increased dexterity and concentration {{on the part of}} the surgeon. To solve those problems, robots were introduced that mimic the movements of the surgeons, allowing them to focus solely on the medical procedure. Currently, there is only visual feedback from the patient to the surgeon. The lack of haptic feedback is one of the most important drawbacks of minimally invasive surgery. To restore the tactile information channel, a tactile feedback systems has to be developed. Such a feedback system consists of two main parts. A tactile sensor to register the tactile information inside the patient, and a tactile display to reflect the tactile information to the skin of the surgeon. The requirements for such a tactile feedback system are derived from the properties of the human sense of touch in the application of soft tissue palpation. The first part of a tactile feedback system is the tactile sensor. After studying different sensor principles, elastoresistance is chosen for its simplicity and robustness, and examined more closely. Elastoresistance is found to be often poorly understood and its physical principle misconceived. Simple experiments show that only the contact resistance plays a role in an elastoresistive tactile sensor. The design of a new tactile sensor is discussed, together with improved readout electronics. These electronics are optimised for high speed and low interference with the sensor signal. They can easily be adapted for different sensitivity and resistance ranges, and only use very low voltages, which is relevant in the context of MIS. The prototype tactile sensor is simple, flexible, cheap, thin and adjusted for the desired pressure range, but still suffers from large hysteresis and drift. The second part of a tactile feedback system is the tactile display. After going through some general design guidelines, an overview is given on existing tactile displays with a slight focus on small scale shape displays. Several prototypes are built in an attempt to meet the challenging requirements. These include the first appearances of hydraulics applied in tactile displays. The first is a closed hydraulic system, profiting from the incompressibility of water to transfer the actuation over a distance. The second uses an open hydraulic system with a piezoelectric proportional valve to <b>actuate</b> the individual <b>pins</b> of the tactile display. A final prototype uses pneumatics and needs a pneumatic proportional valve to control the force of the pins. Existing commercial valves are too large to fit into an already crowded operating room, and make too much noise. Therefore a small and noiseless proportional valve is designed and built, which allows for easy integration into a compact array to operate the necessary large amount of pins. The pressure range which this valve can produce,however, is too small for a tactile display, and the design needs considerably more research before it can be employed. To realise an integrated, functional tactile feedback system a tactile display `lite' is built with commercial pneumatic valves. The aim of the system is to serve as a proof of concept rather than to fulfil all the requirements. It does stand out among other tactile displays found in literature. While there are displays with a larger bandwidth, a higher resolution or a higher force, none of them combines those in a single display. On top of that, the display is very compact and has an almost negligible weight. An experiment to evaluate the combined system shows that it allows to perform a relatively complex discrimination task, even though it is too difficult to distinguish a hard ball in soft tissue. nrpages: 149 status: publishe...|$|R
