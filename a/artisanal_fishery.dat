While local economies were devastated, the overall impact to the national economies was minor. The two main occupations affected by the tsunami were fishing and tourism. The impact on coastal fishing communities and the people living there, some of the poorest in the region, has been devastating with high losses of income earners as well as boats and fishing gear. In Sri Lanka <b>artisanal</b> <b>fishery,</b> where the use of fish baskets, fishing traps, and spears are commonly used, is {{an important source of}} fish for local markets; industrial fishery is the major economic activity, providing direct employment to about 250,000 people.

When assessing the ecological, economic, and social-cultural impacts of protec-tion, {{the dynamics of}} fisheries and fishers reallocation within and around multiple-use MPAs should beanalyzed. Despite this, few studies incorporate the baseline information of fisheries distribution, there-fore compromising an understanding of fishers’ preferences, choices and constrains before losing fishinggrounds through the establishment of zoning and protection measures.

Zero inflatedmodelling, hotspot analysis, vessels distribution range and site fidelity statistics showed that the maindrivers of fishing effort allocation are the placement of preferred fishing grounds which are likely relatedto the distribution of target species and associated habitats.
