5|$|A {{number of}} {{teenagers}} who {{were interested in}} Wicca had begun hanging <b>around</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Warlock Shop, and they too were initiated into the Traditionalist Gwyddoniaid, after gaining parental permission. Proceeding through the outer court of Buczynski's coven, they eventually hived off to form their own coven, the Children of Branwen, in December 1972, with prominent members including Robert Carey, Denny Sargent, and Karen and Eddie Chiecho. Buczynski initially attended some of the group's meetings, in order to instruct these students in the Craft, but soon found his time preoccupied with his own primary coven, leaving the coven under the control of high priestess Kay Smith. She would subsequently go on to found a Welsh Traditionalist coven for adults, leaving the position of high priestess to Melda Tamarack.|$|E
5|$|Clark Kent (Tom Welling) {{sits in his}} loft {{holding a}} piece of coal, waiting for Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk) to arrive. He then takes her to the Kawatche Caves, where they are transported to the Fortress of Solitude. Lana is in shock as she looks <b>around</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Fortress. Clark expresses fear that Lana is {{drifting}} away because of his secret, so he decides to reveal his powers to her. Clark then uses the coal to make a diamond ring and proposes marriage. Afterward, Clark reveals {{what he did to}} his parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent (John Schneider and Annette O'Toole), who tell him that he is old enough to make decisions on his own without the advice of his father. After some initial doubt, Lana returns to the Kent farm to accept Clark's proposal.|$|E

5|$|Morrow {{ordered the}} {{motorcade}} to turn <b>around</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Bridge Street intersection because he realised {{that they had}} proceeded further than expected, and because the police officers {{were not going to}} stop them. After partially turning the motorcade, Licciardello alighted onto the street and complained, in character as bin Laden, about not being invited to the APEC Summit. At this point, the police requested Morrow's identity. After inspecting his fake pass, officers realised that Morrow was from The Chaser and took all eleven members of the motorcade into custody. Surprisingly, as pointed out by the team on their television show, the officers initially ignored Licciardello (Osama Bin Laden) and only arrested Morrow.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, 2011the {{day before}} Chandler's 65th birthdayFlorida Governor Rick Scott signed Chandler's death warrant. His {{execution}} {{was set for}} November 15, 2011, at 4:00pm. His lawyer, Baya Harrison, said that Chandler asked him not to file any frivolous appeals to keep him alive. Harrison said: He is not {{putting a lot of}} pressure on me to go running <b>around</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end to find some magic way out. He is not going to make a scene. He's not going to bemoan the legal system. What he has told me is this: if there is some legal way that I can find to try to prevent him from being executed, he would like me to do what I reasonably can. Harrison also said that Chandler suffered from high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, problems with his kidneys and arthritis.|$|E
5|$|The {{meeting at}} Aintree had been beset by {{problems}} before the race. Fifteen animal rights protesters invaded the course near the first fence (as had also {{happened at the}} 1991 Grand National) resulting in a delayed start. A first false start was caused by several riders becoming tangled in the starting tape. Starter Keith Brown, who was officiating his last National before retirement, waved his red recall flag and a second official, Ken Evans, who was situated 100 yards further down the track, in turn signalled to the leading runners to turn <b>around.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> second attempt, the tape became tangled again — {{around the neck of}} jockey Richard Dunwoody — and Brown called another false start. However, this time his recall flag did not unfurl as he waved it. As a result, 30 of the 39 riders set off around the track, oblivious to the recall.|$|E

5|$|The {{temple was}} reconstructed {{on the basis}} of several {{elements}} (about 4,000) of the temple which were randomly lying <b>around</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> site. This restoration was done by a Chinese team between 2000 and 2009 under a restoration project sponsored by the People's Republic of China. Originally this temple was partly built in the mid-12th century under the reign of King Suryavarman II. Further supplementation of structures was done under the reign of Jayavarman VII. Though the temple was built under Hindu kings during the 11th and 12th centuries with predominantly Hindu deities such as Shiva and Vishnu, representation of Buddha images was interpreted to have been built during the reign of Dharanindravarman, father of Jayavarman VII, who ruled from Preah Khan Kompong Svay.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} many minor {{problems}} all WindSeekers had in 2011, the first major accident occurred on June 2, 2012, on the Cedar Point installation. According to numerous news and rider reports, WindSeeker operated normally as the gondola made its way up the tower. Attached to the tower and gondola are a set of electrical cables that are located inside a plastic casing and are secured by two side panels to prevent the cables from moving <b>around.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> top of the tower, winds were reportedly strong enough to push the electrical cables out of the socket on the tower causing the cables to move around freely. According to a rider riding WindSeeker {{at the time of}} the accident, as the gondola made its way back down the tower, the cables got stuck in the rotating gondola. The plastic casing began to be ripped apart as well as the cables causing the ride to come to a complete stop just over halfway up the tower. Because the electrical cables had been damaged, Cedar Point employees had to manually bring down the gondola. Riders were stuck on the ride for over an hour and no one was injured. WindSeeker at Cedar Point remained closed until the cause of the accident was found and fixed. The ride reopened on June 5, 2012.|$|E

25|$|Strontium titanate's {{only major}} {{drawback}} (if one excludes excess fire) is fragility. It is both softer (hardness 5.5) and more brittle than synthetic rutile—for this reason, strontium titanate was also combined with more durable materials to create composites. It was otherwise the best simulant <b>around</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, {{and at its}} peak annual production was 1.5 million carats (300nbsp&kg). Due to patent coverage, all US production was by National Lead, while large amounts were produced overseas by Nakazumi Company of Japan. Commercial names for strontium titanate included Brilliante, Diagem, Diamontina, Fabulite, and Marvelite.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} subway tunnel from City Hall to {{the portal}} at 23rd Street, {{as well as}} the bridge to carry the line across the Schuylkill River, just north of Market Street, were built from April 1903 to August 1905. Construction on the Market Street Elevated west from this point began In April 1904, and the line opened on March 4, 1907, from 69th Street Terminal to a loop around City Hall at 15th Street. The line was elevated west of the river and underground east of the river. The tunnel was also used by streetcar lines, now SEPTA's Subway-Surface lines, that entered the line just east of the river and turned <b>around</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> City Hall loop. Philadelphia was unusual in that construction of its initial downtown subway was undertaken using PRT (Philadelphia Rapid Transit Co.) private capital only, with no contribution from public funds.|$|E

25|$|In 1909 Hornsby's {{showed the}} British Army their invention, who were bemused, but took the idea {{no further than}} that, {{although}} they subsequently bought four caterpillar tractors in 1910 to tow artillery. A short time later, Hornsbys sold the patent for the caterpillar track in 1914 to The Holt Manufacturing Company of California, USA for $8,000, having only sold one caterpillar tractor commercially. Hornsby's design was far ahead of anything else <b>around</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. Through ownership of the patent, this company became the successful Caterpillar Inc. Tractor Company. Benjamin Holt even {{claimed to be the}} real inventor. In December 1914 the British Army's Colonel Ernest Swinton saw one of Holt's caterpillar tractors towing a piece of artillery, and realised its potential as an attack vehicle. One year later the tank was born (using Hornsby's initial designs), being made in nearby Lincoln by William Foster. It first saw action at the Battle of Flers-Courcelette on 15 September 1916.|$|E
25|$|To {{compensate}} {{for the loss of}} manufacturer teams, four new teams were accepted entry into the 2010 season ahead of a much anticipated 'cost-cap' (see below). Entrants included a reborn Team Lotus – which was led by a Malaysian consortium including Tony Fernandes, the boss of Air Asia; Hispania Racing – the first Spanish Formula One team; as well as Virgin Racing – Richard Branson's entry into the series following a successful partnership with Brawn the year before. They were also joined by the US F1 Team, which planned to run out of the United States as the only non-European based team in the sport. Financial issues befell the squad before they even made the grid. Despite the entry of these new teams, the proposed cost-cap was repealed and these teams – who did not have the budgets of the midfield and top-order teams – ran <b>around</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> back of the field until they inevitably collapsed; HRT in 2012, Caterham (formerly Lotus) in 2014 and Manor (formerly Virgin then Marussia), having survived falling into administration in 2014, went under at the end of 2016.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{began the}} 2013 International season by {{retaining}} the Bill Kelly Memorial Trophy after another Anzac Test win. At {{the end of}} the year, Australia traveled up to play in the 2013 World Cup co-hosted by England and Wales. In their opening game against England, the Kangaroos were surprisingly facing a 0–10 scoreline after twenty minutes. But Australia went on to regain the control and go on to win the match by eight points. The England match was Australia's only 'scare' in the tournament as the Kangaroos went on to win and dominate all of their remaining matches, recording a 244–4 total aggregate score. They went on to earn revenge for their defeat to New Zealand five years ago in the World Cup final to beat them this time <b>around</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same stage. The final was watched in front of a record International rugby league attendance of 74,468 and in the match, five-eighth, Johnathan Thurston broke Mick Cronin's 31-year record of top point scorer after a conversion took him past the previous record of 309 points. This was the Kangaroos' tenth World Cup title. After the England game, Australia recorded five successive games without conceding a try in the tournament. This feat was one game off equaling the 1981–82 Australian team's record.|$|E
