40|$|AbstractIntroduction: In the United States, venovenous extracorporeal {{life support}} has {{traditionally}} been performed with atrial drainage and femoral reinfusion (atrio-femoral flow). Although flow reversal (femoro-atrial flow) may alter recirculation and extracorporeal flow, no direct comparison of these 2 modes has been undertaken. Objective: Our goal was to prospectively compare atrio-femoral and femoro-atrial flow in adult venovenous extracorporeal life support for respiratory failure. Methods: A modified bridge enabling conversion between atrio-femoral and femoro-atrial flow was incorporated in the extracorporeal circuit. Bypass was initiated in the direction that provided the highest pulmonary <b>arterial</b> mixed venous <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation,</b> and the following measurements were taken: (1) maximum extracorporeal flow, (2) highest achievable pulmonary <b>arterial</b> mixed venous <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation,</b> and (3) flow required to maintain the same pulmonary <b>arterial</b> mixed venous <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation</b> in both directions. Flow direction was then reversed, and the measurements were repeated. Data were compared with paired t tests and are presented as mean ± standard deviation. Results: Ten patients were studied, and 9 {{were included in the}} data analysis. Femoro-atrial bypass provided (1) higher maximal extracorporeal flow (femoro-atrial flow = 55. 6 ± 9. 8 mL/kg per minute, atrio-femoral flow = 51. 1 ± 11. 1 mL/kg per minute; P =. 04) and (2) higher pulmonary <b>arterial</b> mixed venous <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation</b> (femoro-atrial flow = 89. 9 % ± 6. 6 %, atrio-femoral flow = 83. 2 % ± 4. 2 %; P =. 006); (3) furthermore, it required less flow to maintain an equivalent pulmonary <b>arterial</b> mixed venous <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation</b> (femoro-atrial flow = 37. 0 ± 12. 2 mL/kg per minute, atrio-femoral flow = 46. 4 ± 8. 8 mL/kg per minute; P =. 04). Conclusions: During venovenous extracorporeal life support, femoro-atrial bypass provided higher maximal extracorporeal flow, higher pulmonary <b>arterial</b> mixed venous <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation,</b> and required comparatively less flow to maintain an equivalent mixed venous <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation</b> than did atrio-femoral bypass.

This study assessed whether a near infra-red spectroscopy tissue <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation</b> monitor (InSpectra™) could detect progressive peripheral tissue ischaemia and whether hyperoxia may confound tissue <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation</b> measurement. Tissue <b>oxygen</b> and <b>arterial</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturations</b> were measured continuously in 30 healthy volunteers, first {{during a period of}} progressive increase in inspired oxygen concentration and subsequently during two periods of low- and high-pressure limb ischaemia. Increasing inspired oxygen concentration was associated with a small increase in mean (SD) tissue <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation</b> of 5. 3 (7. 1) %, reaching a plateau between 30 % and 40 % inspired oxygen. The rate and magnitude of decreases in tissue <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturations</b> were greater during high- than low-pressure ischaemia with a mean (SD) desaturation rate of 3. 3 (0. 9) vs 1. 8 (0. 8) %. min- 1 (p < 0. 01).

Blood-gas-derived shunt fraction correlated well with oximeter-derived ventilation-perfusion index (r = 0. 78, p less than 0. 01). Further, the continuous oxygen extraction ratio (O 2 EI) and mixed venous <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation</b> (SpvO 2) correlated with the oxygen utilization coefficient (O 2 EI:r = 0. 6, p less than 0. 01; SpvO 2, r = 0. 76, p less than 0. 01).
