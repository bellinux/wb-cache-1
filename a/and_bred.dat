5|$|Although other breeds {{were being}} {{increasingly}} imported <b>and</b> <b>bred,</b> {{the numbers of}} the Finnhorse population also slowly began to recover; in 1997, 19,000 Finnhorses existed. Harness racing and associated parimutuel betting, {{and to some degree}} also the relatively new hobby of riding, became the most important factors ensuring the survival of the breed.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have been}} domesticated <b>and</b> <b>bred</b> as poultry {{for use as}} food {{for at least four}} {{thousand}} years. The most important species is the chicken. It appears to have been domesticated by 5000 BC in northeastern China, likely for cockfighting, and only later used for food. In ancient Egypt, poultry including ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and then bred in captivity.|$|E

5|$|El Naseri, or Al-Nasir Muhammad, Sultan of Egypt (1290–1342) {{imported}} <b>and</b> <b>bred</b> numerous Arabians in Egypt. A stud farm {{record was}} made of his purchases describing many of the horses {{as well as their}} abilities, and was deposited in his library, becoming a source for later study. Through the Ottomans, Arabian horses were often sold, traded, or given as diplomatic gifts to Europeans and, later, to Americans.|$|E
5|$|In ancient Egypt, cattle {{were the}} most {{important}} livestock, and sheep, goats, and pigs were also kept; poultry including ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets <b>and</b> <b>bred</b> on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them. The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish. Honey bees were domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom, providing both honey and wax.|$|E
5|$|Leopard is {{the only}} {{stallion}} imported prior to 1888 who left known purebred descendants in America. In 1888 Randolph Huntington imported the desert-bred Arabian mare *Naomi, <b>and</b> <b>bred</b> her to Leopard, producing Leopard's only purebred Arabian son, Anazeh, who sired eight purebred Arabian foals, four of whom still appear in pedigrees today.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the many}} {{accounts}} of ancient breeds of piebald sheep {{is the story}} of Jacob from the first book of the Hebrew Bible, called by Christians the Old Testament. According to the Book of Genesis (Genesis 30:3143), Jacob took every speckled and spotted sheep from his father-in-law's (Laban's) flock <b>and</b> <b>bred</b> them. Due to the resemblance to the animal described in Genesis, the Jacob sheep was named for the Biblical figure of Jacob sometime in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Nagle had a Pomeranian and a Bulldog, but {{was promised}} {{she could have}} a larger dog once her {{schooling}} was completed. In 1913 her dream came to fruition with the purchase of her first Irish Wolfhound, Manin Michael, for £5. James Nagle subsequently registered the dog with the Kennel Club, before it {{was transferred to the}} ownership of Mr and Mrs Nagle, and its name changed to Sir Michael of Sheppey in May 1917. Food shortages during the First World War resulted in an official prohibition on dog breeding, but Nagle ignored it <b>and</b> <b>bred</b> her first litter from a bitch called Lady Alma of Sheppey.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have also}} been {{captured}} <b>and</b> <b>bred</b> by zoos, {{but they are not}} a common zoo species. Fishers are poor animals to exhibit because, in general, they hide from visitors all day. Some zoos have had difficulty keeping fishers alive since they are susceptible to many diseases in captivity. Yet {{there is at least one}} example of a fisher kept in captivity that lived to be ten years old, and one case of a fisher living to be approximately 14 years old, well beyond its natural lifespan of 7 years.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} {{economic}} uses, birds have been hunted for food since Palaeolithic times. They have been captured <b>and</b> <b>bred</b> as poultry to provide meat and eggs {{since at least the}} time of Ancient Egypt. Some species have been used, too, to help locate or to catch food, as with cormorant fishing and the use of honeyguides. Feathers have long been used for bedding, as well as for quill pens and for fletching arrows.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the Newfoundland pony {{was used}} for ploughing, {{assisting}} with gardens, hauling kelp from the beaches, gathering hay, and carrying wood, and they were also used for transportation. They were successfully used <b>and</b> <b>bred</b> to withstand the hard climate, and by 1935 there were over 9,000 ponies on the island. During the mid-20th century, however, increasing mechanization and a ban on free-roaming ponies contributed {{to a decline in}} the population, and increased exports to France for horse meat in the 1970s almost led to the extinction of the breed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the year}} 1602 in the Marvel Universe, for an unknown reason, superheroes have {{appeared}} about 400 years early. They were born <b>and</b> <b>bred</b> {{in this era}} and some hold important positions in high places.

5|$|Mountain birds around Helvellyn {{include the}} raven (Corvus corax), {{which has now}} become common. Peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus), buzzards (Buteo buteo) and ring ouzels (Turdus torquatus) have all bred in the {{immediate}} area. Skylarks (Alauda arvensis) and wheatears (Oenanthe oenanthe) are frequently encountered. At one time eagles (probably Aquila chrysaetos) soared over the mountain <b>and</b> <b>bred</b> on the steep cliffs above Red Tarn, but even in Wordsworth's day they had gone, having been persecuted to extinction.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} habitat includes alkaline marshes, acid bogs, lakes, ponds, rivers, marshes, brackish {{marshes and}} {{the margins of}} estuaries and other aquatic environments in northern Saskatchewan, Manitoba, across Ontario, Quebec {{as well as the}} Atlantic Canadian Provinces, Great Lakes and the Adirondacks in the United States. It is partially migratory, and many winter in the east-central United States, especially coastal areas; some remain year-round in the Great Lakes region. This duck is a rare vagrant to Great Britain and Ireland, where over the years several birds have settled in <b>and</b> <b>bred</b> with the local mallard. The resulting hybrid can present considerable identification difficulties.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the breed is {{uncertain}} prior to the mid-19th century with two theories being prevalent. Clumber Spaniels have been kept <b>and</b> <b>bred</b> by various British Monarchs, including Prince Albert, King Edward VII and King George V. They were introduced into Canada in 1844, and in 1884 {{became one of the}} first ten breeds recognised by the American Kennel Club. The breed can suffer from a variety of breed-specific ailments varying in severity from temporary lameness due to bone growth whilst young to hip dysplasia or spinal disc herniation.|$|E

5|$|Wizard was a {{chestnut}} colt foaled in 1806 <b>and</b> <b>bred</b> by Mr. Goodison. He was sired by Sorcerer, {{a successful}} racehorse and three-time Champion sire in Britain. Amongst Sorcerer's other progeny were 2000 Guineas and Derby winner Smolensko, St. Leger winner Soothsayer and the Oaks winners Morel, Maid of Orleans and Sorcery. Wizard's dam was {{a daughter of}} Precipitate. Wizard was the second of her ten foals. He was trained by Tom Perren.|$|E
5|$|About 10,000years ago {{the humans}} who {{inhabited}} the lands around the Mediterranean basin began to domesticate wild animals. Pigs, cattle, goats, sheep, horses, camels, {{cats and dogs}} were all kept <b>and</b> <b>bred</b> in captivity. These animals would have brought their viruses with them. The transmission of viruses from animals to humans can occur, but such zoonotic infections are rare and subsequent human-to-human transmission of animal viruses is even rarer, although there are notable exceptions such as influenza. Most viruses are species-specific and would have posed no threat to humans. The rare epidemics of viral diseases originating in animals would have been short-lived because the viruses were not fully adapted to humans and the human populations were too small to maintain the chains of infection.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{the late}} 19th century, {{uncontrolled}} crossbreeding created {{a decline in}} the population of purebred Mérens. By the early 20th century, some breeders in L'Hospitalet and Mérens-les-Vals began to work against these crossings with outside breeds <b>and</b> <b>bred</b> only horses with conformation similar to the original Mérens. These breeders wanted to keep alive the traditional Mérens, which they valued for its hardiness and versatility. In 1908, control of breeding was given to the President of the Société d’Agriculture de l’Ariège (Agricultural Society of Ariege), Gabriel Lamarque, who was dedicated to the preservation of the breed. In 1933, the Syndicat d'élevage du Mérens (Breeding Society of Mérens) was created, and in 1948 the first stud book was created {{under the control of the}} French National Stud.|$|E
