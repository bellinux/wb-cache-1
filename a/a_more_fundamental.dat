5|$|According to Witten, M {{should stand}} for “magic”, “mystery”, or “membrane” {{according}} to taste, {{and the true}} meaning of the title should be decided when <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> formulation of the theory is known.|$|E
5|$|David Brooks {{argued that}} <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> {{shift from a}} materialist to a post-materialist mindset has {{occurred}} in recent generations. While for generations born early in the century increased income {{was the same as}} improvements in lifestyle this is no longer true for people born into an affluent, information driven world. Younger generations live much more intellectually diverse lives and cites much user generated content as being mostly produced outside of the monetary economy. He affirms Cowen's acknowledgment that this has brought large increases in human happiness with correspondingly little economic activity.|$|E
5|$|With modern {{insights}} into quantum mechanics and technology that can accelerate particles {{close to the}} speed of light, particle physics has devised a Standard Model to describe forces between particles smaller than atoms. The Standard Model predicts that exchanged particles called gauge bosons are the fundamental means by which forces are emitted and absorbed. Only four main interactions are known: in order of decreasing strength, they are: strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational. High-energy particle physics observations made during the 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> electroweak interaction.|$|E
50|$|The above {{indicates}} that terminological data (comprising {{various kinds of}} knowledge representation) possibly have <b>a</b> much <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> role in domain-related information and knowledge than commonly understood.|$|R

25|$|Confucianism tolerates the Chinese folk {{recognition}} {{of the existence of}} animistic spirits, ghosts and deities. It approves paying them proper respect, but at <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> level encourages avoiding them. Confucian thought is notable as the framework upon which the syncretic Neo-Confucianism was built.Huang (1999). Pg 5.|$|E
25|$|While {{some aspects}} of this manic {{collecting}} {{could have been a}} manifestation of Catherine's desire for a recognition of her intellectual concepts, there was also <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> motivation: necessity. Just twenty years earlier, so scarce were the furnishings of the Imperial palaces that bedsteads, mirrors, tables and chairs had to be conveyed between Moscow and Saint Petersburg each time the court moved.|$|E
25|$|David Bohm viewed {{quantum theory}} and {{relativity}} as contradictory, which implied <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> {{level in the}} universe. He claimed both quantum theory and relativity pointed towards this deeper theory, which he formulated as a quantum field theory. This more fundamental level was proposed to represent an undivided wholeness and an implicate order, from which arises the explicate order of the universe as we experience it.|$|E
5000|$|Oral literatures forms <b>a</b> {{generally}} <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> {{component of}} culture, but operates {{in many ways}} {{as one might expect}} literature to do. The Ugandan scholar Pio Zirimu introduced the term orature in an attempt to avoid an oxymoron, but oral literature remains more common both in academic and popular writing.|$|R
60|$|But {{there is}} another reason, of <b>a</b> still <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> nature, why the import of words should be the {{earliest}} subject of the logician’s consideration: because without it he can not examine into the import of Propositions. Now this is a subject which stands on the very threshold of the science of logic.|$|R
2500|$|Implicit in the Stamp Act dispute was <b>an</b> issue <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> than {{taxation}} and representation: {{the question of}} the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies. Parliament provided its answer to this question when it repealed the Stamp Act in 1766 by simultaneously passing the Declaratory Act, which proclaimed that Parliament could legislate for the colonies [...] "in all cases whatsoever".|$|R
25|$|Although {{the central}} concept of {{marginalism}} {{is that of}} marginal utility, marginalists, {{following the lead of}} Alfred Marshall, drew upon the idea of marginal physical productivity in explanation of cost. The neoclassical tradition that emerged from British marginalism abandoned the concept of utility and gave marginal rates of substitution <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> role in analysis. Marginalism {{is an integral part of}} mainstream economic theory.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} thermodynamics {{the entropy of}} {{the reference}} state can be put equal to zero at any convenient temperature and pressure. For example, for pure substances, one can take the entropy of the solid at the melting point at 1bar equal to zero. From <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> point of view, the third law of thermodynamics {{suggests that there is}} a preference to take S = 0 at T = 0 (absolute zero) for perfectly ordered materials such as crystals.|$|E
25|$|The {{rest of the}} {{recently}} expanded Politburo (Rykov, Mikhail Tomsky, Bukharin) was at first uncommitted, but eventually joined the troika. Stalin's power of patronage {{in his capacity as}} general secretary clearly played a role, but Trotsky and his supporters later concluded that <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> reason was the process of slow bureaucratization of the Soviet regime once the extreme conditions of the Civil War were over. Much of the Bolshevik elite wanted 'normalcy,' while Trotsky was personally and politically personified as representing a turbulent revolutionary period that they would much rather leave behind.|$|E

60|$|This {{question}} {{really depends}} upon <b>a</b> still <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> one, viz., which of two common types of character, {{for the general}} good of humanity, it is most desirable should predominate--the active or the passive type; that which struggles against evils, or that which endures them; that which bends to circumstances, or that which endeavours to make circumstances bend to itself.|$|R
25|$|PD {{patients}} often demonstrate {{deficits in}} their ability to sequence information, or date events. Part of the problems is hypothesized to be due to <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> difficulty in coordinating or planning retrieval strategies, rather than failure at the level of encoding or storing information in memory. This deficit is also likely to be due to an underlying difficulty in properly retrieving script information. PD patients often exhibit signs of irrelevant intrusions, incorrect ordering of events, and omission of minor components in their script retrieval, leading to disorganized and inappropriate application of script information.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> {{transformation}} was the economy's growing {{adoption of}} cash crops {{instead of just}} growing rice and grain. Vegetable and meat production increased {{to the point that}} Chinese agricultural production was adding the equivalent of California’s vegetable industry every two years. Growth in the sector slowed after 1984, with agriculture falling from 40% of GDP to 16%; however, increases in agricultural productivity allowed workers to be released for work in industry and services, while simultaneously increasing agricultural production. Trade in agriculture was also liberalized and China became an exporter of food, a great contrast to its previous famines and shortages.|$|E
25|$|Neutral monists {{adhere to}} the {{position}} that perceived {{things in the world}} can be regarded as either physical or mental depending on whether one is interested in their relationship to other things in the world or their relationship to the perceiver. For example, a red spot on a wall is physical in its dependence on the wall and the pigment of which it is made, but it is mental in so far as its perceived redness depends on the workings of the visual system. Unlike dual-aspect theory, neutral monism does not posit <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> substance of which mind and body are aspects.|$|E
50|$|In {{the field}} of epistemology, {{the problem of the}} {{criterion}} is an issue regarding the starting point of knowledge. This is <b>a</b> separate and <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> issue than the regress argument found in discussions on justification of knowledge.|$|R
50|$|A {{potential}} {{implementation of}} micro-cooling {{is to achieve}} <b>an</b> even <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> integration of cooling components and microprocessor. This next step would be to fabricate electrodes and airflow surfaces on the micron scale using the same techniques currently used to manufacture microprocessors themselves. This level of integration could lower manufacturing costs and potentially increase thermal efficiency beyond what an externally mounted fan or EFA could achieve.|$|R
50|$|At <b>a</b> yet <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> level, {{quantum chromodynamics}} binding energy is the energy which binds the various quarks {{together}} inside a hadron. This energy {{derives from the}} strong interaction, which is mediated by gluons. The chromodynamic binding energy inside a nucleon, for example, amounts to approximately 99% of the nucleon's mass. The chromodynamic binding energy of a proton is about 928.9 MeV, while that of a neutron is about 927.7 MeV.|$|R
25|$|Objective {{collapse}} theories, {{which involve}} a dynamic (and non-deterministic) {{collapse of the}} wave function (e.g. Ghirardi–Rimini–Weber theory, Penrose interpretation, or causal fermion systems) avoid these absurdities. The theory of causal fermion systems for example, is able to unify quantum mechanics, general relativity and quantum field theory, via <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> theory which is non-linear, but {{gives rise to the}} linear behaviour of the wave function and also gives rise to the non-linear, non-deterministic, wave-function collapse. These theories suggest that {{a deeper understanding of the}} theory underlying quantum mechanics shows the universe is indeed non-deterministic at a fundamental level.|$|E
25|$|In {{the theory}} of inflation, the rapid initial {{expansion}} of the universe is caused by a hypothetical particle called the inflaton. The exact properties of this particle are not fixed by the theory but should ultimately be derived from <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> theory such as string theory. Indeed, {{there have been a number}} of attempts to identify an inflaton within the spectrum of particles described by string theory, and to study inflation using string theory. While these approaches might eventually find support in observational data such as measurements of the cosmic microwave background, the application of string theory to cosmology is still in its early stages.|$|E
25|$|The Little-Parks {{effect was}} {{discovered}} in 1962 in experiments with empty and thin-walled superconducting cylinders subjected to a parallel magnetic field. The electrical resistance of such cylinders shows a periodic oscillation with the magnetic flux through the cylinder, the period being h/2e= 2.07×10−15 V·s. The explanation provided by William Little and Ronald Parks is that the resistance oscillation reflects <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> phenomenon, i.e. periodic oscillation of the superconducting critical temperature (Tc). This is the temperature at which the sample becomes superconducting. The Little-Parks effect {{is a result of}} collective quantum behavior of superconducting electrons. It reflects the general fact that it is the fluxoid rather than the flux which is quantized in superconductors. The Little-Parks effect demonstrates that the vector potential couples to an observable physical quantity, namely the superconducting critical temperature.|$|E

40|$|Various common {{definitions}} of intelligent buildings are discussed. A systems view of building design is {{a starting point}} for considering business, space and building management. An intelligent building helps an organisation to fulfil its objectives by facilitating the management of these resources and thereby increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the organisation.

25|$|The U.S. Supreme Court {{unanimously}} {{found the}} St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance amounted to viewpoint-based discrimination is {{in conflict with}} rights of free speech, because it selectively criminalized bias-motivated speech or symbolic speech for disfavored topics while permitting such speech for other topics. Many critics further assert that it conflicts with <b>an</b> even <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> right: free thought. The claim is that hate-crime legislation effectively makes certain ideas or beliefs, including religious ones, illegal, in other words, thought crimes.|$|R
25|$|Spencer's {{interest}} in psychology derived from <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> concern {{which was to}} establish the universality of natural law. In common with others of his generation, including the members of Chapman's salon, he was possessed {{with the idea of}} demonstrating {{that it was possible to}} show that everything in the universe – including human culture, language, and morality – could be explained by laws of universal validity. This was in contrast to the views of many theologians of the time who insisted that some parts of creation, in particular the human soul, were beyond the realm of scientific investigation. Comte's Système de Philosophie Positive had been written with the ambition of demonstrating the universality of natural law, and Spencer was to follow Comte in the scale of his ambition. However, Spencer differed from Comte in believing it was possible to discover a single law of universal application which he identified with progressive development and was to call the principle of evolution.|$|E
25|$|While the JIFF policy {{worked on}} one level—the {{number of foreign}} players {{recruited}} into the Top 14 went from 61 for 2011–12 to 34 for 2014–15—clubs quickly found a way around the rules. Many clubs dispatched scouts to identify top teenage prospects in other countries, and then enrolled them in their academies to start the JIFF qualification process. For example, the 59 players in the 2015–16 Clermont youth squad included 17 from nine countries outside of France. <b>A</b> <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> problem was identified in 2015 by Laurent Labit, at the time backs coach of the club now known as Racing 92. In an interview with British rugby journalist Gavin Mortimer, Labit pointed out that France has no organized team sport in its educational system at the primary level—children must join an outside club in order to play sports. Only at age 15 do youths {{have the opportunity to}} attend special sporting schools, but places in such institutions are limited. In turn, this means that young French players are technically well behind their counterparts in many other countries, most notably those of the Commonwealth.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} some event-specific debates too – such as over the Party's precise {{attitude}} to the Spanish Civil War in 1936, to the Hungarian Uprising of 1956 {{and then to the}} movements for political democracy in the Soviet bloc states in the 1980s. On other, far fewer, occasions, small groups of Party members, sometimes concerned by the Party's pace of growth (or lack of growth in some periods) have developed ideas which have challenged the Party's basic, core positions more clearly. Having initially agreed with the Party's principles and analysis they developed a political critique which challenged these positions at <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>fundamental</b> level. But even in these instances, only a handful of disputes have been so serious that they have led to organisational breakaways, and for a political body that has seen thousands of members join over a century of activity, this is remarkable. While sometimes damaging to the Party, these have always involved very small numbers of dissidents who have either left the organisation voluntarily or who have been expelled by a Party Poll. In each case they have been more an instance of splintering than splitting. For the historical record, six splinters of the various kinds discussed above can be readily identified. They are detailed below in chronological order.|$|E
