40|$|A novel {{methodology}} for the fault diagnosis of rolling bearing in strong background noise, based on sensitive intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) selection of ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and <b>adaptive</b> stochastic <b>resonance,</b> is proposed. The original vibration signal is decomposed {{into a group}} of IMFs and a residual trend item by EEMD. Constructing weighted kurtosis index difference spectrum (WKIDS) to adaptively select sensitive IMFs, this method can overcome the shortcomings of the existing methods such as subjective choice or need to determine a threshold using the correlation coefficient. To further reduce noise and enhance weak characteristics, the <b>adaptive</b> stochastic <b>resonance</b> is employed to amplify each sensitive IMF. Then, the ensemble average is used to eliminate the stochastic noise. The simulation and rolling element bearing experiment with an inner fault are performed to validate the proposed method. The {{results show that the}} proposed method not only overcomes the difficulty of choosing sensitive IMFs, but also, combined with <b>adaptive</b> stochastic <b>resonance,</b> can better enhance the weak fault characteristics. Moreover, the proposed method is better than EEMD and <b>adaptive</b> stochastic <b>resonance</b> of each sensitive IMF, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed method in highly noisy environments...|$|R

50|$|With Gail Carpenter, Grossberg {{developed}} the <b>adaptive</b> <b>resonance</b> theory (ART). ART is a cognitive and neural theory {{of how the}} brain can quickly learn, and stably remember and recognize, objects and events in a changing world. ART proposed a solution of the stability-plasticity dilemma; namely, how a brain or machine can learn quickly about new objects and events without just as quickly being forced to forget previously learned, but still useful, memories. ART predicts how learned top-down expectations focus attention on expected combinations of features, leading to a synchronous resonance that can drive fast learning. ART also predicts how large enough mismatches between bottom-up feature patterns and top-down expectations can drive a memory search, or hypothesis testing, for recognition categories with which to better learn to classify the world. ART thus defines a type of self-organizing production system. ART was practically demonstrated through the ART family of classifiers (e.g., ART 1, ART 2, ART 2A, ART 3, ARTMAP, fuzzy ARTMAP, ART eMAP, distributed ARTMAP), developed with Gail Carpenter, which {{has been used in}} large-scale applications in engineering and technology where fast, yet stable, incrementally learned classification and prediction are needed.|$|E

Among the components of the centrifugal fan, the impeller is a key part because it is used to transform kinetic energy into pressure energy.

Based on blade vibration signals, this research applies an <b>adaptive</b> stochastic <b>resonance</b> (ASR) method to diagnose crack fault in centrifugal fan. The ASR method, which can utilize the optimization ability of the grid search method and adaptively realize the optimal stochastic resonance system matching input signals, may weaken the noise and highlight weak characteristic and thus can diagnose the fault accurately.

50|$|As {{noted in}} the section on Education and Early Research, Grossberg has studied how brains give rise to minds since he took the {{introductory}} psychology course as a freshman at Dartmouth College in 1957. At that time, Grossberg introduced the paradigm of using nonlinear systems of differential equations to show how brain mechanisms can give rise to behavioral functions. This paradigm is helping to solve the classical mind/body problem, and is the basic mathematical formalism that is used in biological neural network research today. In particular, in 1957-1958, Grossberg discovered widely used equations for (1) short-term memory (STM), or neuronal activation (often called the Additive and Shunting models, or the Hopfield model after John Hopfield's 1984 application of the Additive model equation); (2) medium-term memory (MTM), or activity-dependent habituation (often called habituative transmitter gates, or depressing synapses after Larry Abbott's 1997 introduction of this term); and (3) long-term memory (LTM), or neuronal learning (often called gated steepest descent learning). One variant of these learning equations, called Instar Learning, was introduced by Grossberg in 1976 into <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Resonance</b> Theory and Self-Organizing Maps for the learning of adaptive filters in these models. This learning equation was also used by Kohonen in his applications of Self-Organizing Maps starting in 1984. Another variant of these learning equations, called Outstar Learning, was used by Grossberg starting in 1967 for spatial pattern learning. Outstar and Instar learning were combined by Grossberg in 1976 in a three-layer network for the learning of multi-dimensional maps from any m-dimensional input space to any n-dimensional output space. This application was called Counter-propagation by Hecht-Nielsen in 1987.|$|E

40|$|Circadian rhythms with an {{endogenous}} period close {{or equal}} to the natural light-dark cycle are considered evolutionarily <b>adaptive</b> (‘circadian <b>resonance</b> hypothesis’). Despite remarkable insight into the molecular mechanisms driving circadian cycles, this hypothesis has not been tested under natural conditions for any eukaryotic organism. We tested this in mice bearing a short-period mutation in the enzyme casein kinase 1  (tau mutation) which accelerates free-running circadian cycles. We compared daily activity (feeding) rhythms, survivorship and reproduction in six replicate populations in outdoor experimental enclosures, established with wild-type, hetero- or homozygous mice in a Mendelian ratio. In the release cohort, survival was reduced in the homozygote mutant mice revealing strong selection against short-period genotypes. Over the course of 14 months, the relative frequency of the tau allele dropped from initial parity to 20 %. Adult survival and recruitment of juveniles into the population contributed about equally to the selection for wild type alleles. The expression of activity during daytime varied throughout the experiment and was significantly increased by the tau mutation. The strong selection against the short-period tau allele observed here contrasts with earlier studies showing absence of selection against a Per 2 mutation, which disrupts internal clock function, but does not change period length. These findings are consistent with, and predicted by the theory that resonance of the circadian system {{plays an important role}} in individual fitness...|$|R

Combination of optimal Morlet wavelet and autocorrelation analysis was used to extract the early stage fault of rolling bearings, and GA was employed to optimize the filtering parameters of the Morlet wavelet [53]. Some related research was conducted in the author’s laboratory. For example, Yan, et al [54], employed PSO to optimize the structural element scale of the combined morphological hat transformation and improved the accuracy of the mathematical morphology operator in processing vibration signals. The experimental results showed that the proposed method could effectively identify the wear fault on the high shaft of a wind turbine gearbox. Zhang, et al [55], utilized SFLA to optimize the parameters of the Morlet wavelet and used information entropy as the fitness function. The optimized Morlet wavelet had superior capability in extracting the early fault feature of rolling bearings.

The need for high-intensity focused ultrasound (sound with frequencies between 20 kHz to 10 MHz) and modeling of such systems has drawn great attention in engineering. Ultrasound excitation has found recent application in terms of replacing the existing dynamic mechanical systems that use high energy {{with low levels of}} efficiency. The proposed thesis work focuses on an application of acoustic cavitation and on <b>adaptive</b> control of <b>resonance</b> amplification {{to be used in the}} paper pulp industry. The primary objective is to keep a system of coupled and tuned resonances stable, and by that obtain high cavitation intensity in a water filled beaker. The secondary aspect is to numerically model and experimentally evaluate a prototype beaker, where the adaptive control scheme is implemented to attain high and stable cavitation intensity. The characteristic control parameters (excitation frequency and amplitude) can be adjusted to the fluid condition in the beaker (reactor) by a feedback control from a pressure sensor inside the beaker. The aim of this feedback loop is to keep the resonance phenomena stable with respect to an adaptable frequency. In this application, the resonance amplification is mainly used to generate and control cavitation at a frequency that corresponds to a range of beaker natural frequencies. The results of the development process show that high cavitation intensity can be achieved by ultrasound induced power. The electric power input required to achieve high cavitation intensity is relatively low and resulted in high energy efficiency. The results of the study will be used for an application for fibrillation of cellulose fibers to further improve energy efficiency in paper pulp industry. vipul: + 46 - 723104925 Taraka: + 46 - 72321940...|$|R
