5|$|Four {{companies}} bid for {{the initial}} public service obligation to operate the line: Fjord1 Partner, Norges Statsbaner, Tide Bane and Veolia Transport Norge. On 3 April 2009, the public transport agency Skyss announced that Fjord1 Partner, {{a joint venture between}} Fjord1 AS and Keolis, had won the tender competition. Fjord1 Partner received 324 applications for their 26 jobs as drivers and 10 jobs as traffic controllers. In 2014 Fjord1 <b>AS</b> <b>sold</b> their shares in Fjord1 Partner to Keolis, and the company changed its name to Keolis Norge AS.|$|E
5|$|The HTC Dream was {{the first}} ever {{smartphone}} to ship with the Android operating system. The operating system heavily integrates with, and provides apps for various Google services, such as Gmail (with push email support), Maps, Search, Talk, and YouTube, while the contacts and calendar apps can sync with the online Google Contacts and Google Calendar services respectively. The device also ships with an email app supporting other POP3 and IMAP-based mail services, an instant messaging app with support for multiple services, and a WebKit-based web browser. A notification system displays icons for certain events (such as e-mails and text messages) {{on the left side}} of the status bar across the top of the screen; dragging down from the top of the screen exposes a tray with more detailed information for each notification. The Android Market can be used to download additional apps for the device. The G1 <b>as</b> <b>sold</b> by T-Mobile also shipped with an Amazon MP3 app, allowing users to purchase DRM-free music online, and download them straight to the device via Wi-Fi.|$|E

25|$|The only {{hardware}} system that CP/M, <b>as</b> <b>sold</b> by Digital Research, would support was the Intel 8080 Development System. Manufacturers of CP/M-compatible systems customized {{portions of the}} operating system for their own combination of installed memory, disk drives, and console devices. CP/M would also run on systems based on the Zilog Z80 processor since the Z80 was compatible with 8080 code. While the Digital Research distributed core of CP/M (BDOS, CCP, core transient commands) did not use any of the Z80-specific instructions, many Z80-based systems used Z80 code in the system-specific BIOS, and many applications were dedicated to Z80-based CP/M machines.|$|E
25|$|Bell-metal {{and brass}} {{utensils}} are manufactured {{in large quantities}} at Khagra, Berhampore, Kandi, Baranagar and Jangipur. They are exported as well <b>as</b> <b>sold</b> in the local markets. Locks and betelnut cutters of a superior kind are made at Dhulian and iron chests at Jangipur. The problem of getting raw materials for the brass and bell-metal artisans of the district is, however, acute. While delay in getting raw materials owing to the complicated procedural formalities involved in the submission of applications for raw materials has been almost a constant factor, the industry has also {{been affected by the}} change in consumers demand in favour of stainless steel, plastic and ceramic goods and crockery.|$|E
25|$|The most {{detailed}} economic {{records for the}} region are of the Marquesado's ranching haciendas, which produced draft animals (horses, mules, burros, and oxen) and sheep and goats, for meat and wool. Cattle ranching for meat, tallow, and leather were also important. Tallow for candles used in churches and residences and leather used {{in a variety of}} ways (saddles, other tack, boots, furniture, machinery) were significant items in the larger colonial economy, finding markets well beyond Tehuantepec. Since the Marquesado operated as an integrated enterprise, draft animals were used in other holdings for transport, agriculture, and mining in Oaxaca, Morelos, Toluca, and Mexico City as well <b>as</b> <b>sold.</b> Raised in Tehuantepec, the animals were driven to other Marquesado holdings for use and distribution.|$|E

25|$|The Nord-100 was {{introduced}} in 1979, which was specialized at flexibility and focused on administrative applications. When Digital launched their VAX-11 in 1977, Norsk Data had the Nord-5 32-bit computer ready for CERN. As the VAX-11 was 32-bit and regarded as a superminicomputer, Norsk Data did not initially {{see it as a}} competitor since the Nord-5 had much better processing power. Nord-50 had similar processing power to the Nord-5, but was not a general-purpose computer. The 32 bit computer used a Nord-10 front processor that ran the SINTRAN III operating system. Development of the ND-500 started in 1978 and had so fundamental changes to the system architecture (was not made from bit-slice components but microprammed with a new instruction set) that all software had to be rewritten - except for the SINTRAN. The computer was launched in 1981, but with fundamental shortcomings imposed by the OS It was much faster than the VAX, but did not meet the general customers' expectation of being a multi-purpose computer. Later models improved the performance and tweaking of the system allowed it to become a multipurpose system.at the performance of a special purpose super computer <b>as</b> <b>sold</b> by Cray. A major contract with the ND-500 was the Joint European Torus project, which took delivery of twenty-seven ND-100 and -500 units. Development of the ND-5000 started before the ND-500 was completed. The design was changed to become more modular; this increased the development costs, but reduced production costs and increased scalability. On the ND5000, components were placed in cards that were interconnected, initially to simplify cooling but also to enable the high clock frequency If an electric current is switched at a clock frequency of 1GHz, it travel about one foot per cycle, so 10cm is a delay of a clock cycle at 3GHz. The ND-500 computers had timing problems caused by wire-distance, and going faster just required everything to be close.|$|E
