The effects of temperature on springback behaviour were identified. Results indicate that springback increased with decreasing temperature. The same amount of springback was measured at 0, 25, and 100 C. It was observed that the amount of springback increased between 100 and 200 C and then started to decrease beyond 200 C.

Two of {{the basic elements of}} the kit, the links and flexure joints, have been identified, and an assembly method has been developed. This paper deals with the problem of integrating the wiring in these parts, a significant task on this size scale. This novel feature is achieved {{through the use of a}} flexible ribbon cable consisting of three wires made out of patterned copper foil and polyimide. Low melting point solder has been tested successfully to make the electrical interconnect between the parts. We discuss the issues that must be addressed in designing the flexure-wiring combination. In addition, the paper presents the methodology for fabricating structures with integrated wiring using a simple four bar mechanism as an example. Finally, the tests show that the wiring loop over a flexure connecting a distally located sensor on the mechanism maintains both its electrical and mechanical integrity even during large motions.

40|$|Purpose Representation {{of anatomy}} {{appearance}} {{is one of}} the key problems in medical image analysis. An appearance model represents the anatomies with parametric forms, which are then vectorised for prior learning, segmentation and classification tasks. Methods We propose a part-based parametric appearance model we refer to as a deformable appearance pyramid (DAP). The parts are delineated by multi-scale local feature pyramids extracted from an image pyramid. Each anatomy is represented by an appearance pyramid, with the variability within a population approximated by local translations of the multi-scale parts and linear appearance variations in the <b>assembly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parts.</b> We introduce DAPs built on two types of image pyramids, namely Gaussian and wavelet pyramids, and present two approaches to model the prior and fit the model, one explicitly using a subspace Lucas–Kanade algorithm and the other implicitly using the supervised descent method (SDM). Results We validate the performance of the DAP instances with difference configurations on the problem of lumbar spinal stenosis for localising the landmarks and classifying the pathologies. We also compare them with classic methods such as active shape models, active appearance models and constrained local models. Experimental results show that the DAP built on wavelet pyramids and fitted with SDM gives the best results in both landmark localisation and classification. Conclusion A new appearance model is introduced with several configurations presented and evaluated. The DAPs can be readily applied for other clinical problems for the tasks of prior learning, landmark detection and pathology classification...|$|E

Multipliers at these frequencies have not previously been demonstrated, {{and the object}} of this work was to show whether such circuits are really practical. A practical circuit is one which not only performs as well as is required, but also can be replicated in a time that is feasible. As the frequency of circuits is increased, the difficulties in fabrication and assembly increase rapidly. Building all of the circuit on GaAs as a monolithic circuit is highly desirable to minimize the complexity of assembly, but at the highest frequencies, even a complete monolithic circuit is extremely small, and presents serious handling difficulty. This {{is compounded by the}} requirement for a very thin substrate. Assembly can become very difficult because of handling problems and critical placement. It is very desirable to make the chip big enough to that it can be seen without magnification, and strong enough that it may be picked up with tweezers. Machined blocks to house the chips present an additional challenge. Blocks with complex features are very expensive, and these also imply very critical <b>assembly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parts.</b> It would be much better if the features in the block were as simple as possible and non-critical to the function of the chip.

40|$|Object class {{representation}} {{is one of}} the key problems in various medical image analysis tasks. We propose a part-based parametric appearance model we refer to as an Active Appearance Pyramid (AAP). The parts are delineated by multi-scale Local Feature Pyramids (LFPs) for superior spatial specificity and distinctiveness. An AAP models the variability within a population with local translations of multi-scale parts and linear appearance variations of the <b>assembly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parts.</b> It can fit and represent new instances by adjusting the shape and appearance parameters. The fitting process uses a two-step iterative strategy: local landmark searching followed by shape regularisation. We present a simultaneous local feature searching and appearance fitting algorithm based on the weighted Lucas and Kanade method. A shape regulariser is derived to calculate the maximum likelihood shape with respect to the prior and multiple landmark candidates from multi-scale LFPs, with a compact closed-form solution. We apply the 2 D AAP on the modelling of variability in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) and validate its performance on 200 studies consisting of routine axial and sagittal MRI scans. Intervertebral sagittal and parasagittal cross-sections are typically used for the diagnosis of LSS, we therefore build three AAPs on L 3 / 4, L 4 / 5 and L 5 /S 1 axial cross-sections and three on parasagittal slices. Experiments show significant improvement in convergence range, robustness to local minima and segmentation precision compared with Constrained Local Models (CLMs), Active Shape Models (ASMs) and Active Appearance Models (AAMs), as well as superior performance in appearance reconstruction compared with AAMs. We also validate the performance on 3 D CT volumes of hip joints from 38 studies. Compared to AAMs, AAPs achieve a higher segmentation and reconstruction precision. Moreover, AAPs have a significant improvement in efficiency, consuming about half the memory and less than 10 % of the training time and 15 % of the testing time...|$|E

Microfabrication and <b>assembly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parts</b> can be done in a batch-process on a wafer/foil level, opening the way to further size reduction of the components. The coils are realized using an in-house developed high-resolution polyimide spinning and Cu electroplating process. Winding widths down to 5 μm have been obtained and total device volumes are ranging between 1. 5 and 10 mm 3. We have measured the inductive and resistive properties of our devices as a function of frequency and device geometry. The results clearly show the high potential of our technology for power applications, in which miniaturization and small-size is an issue. In the domain of RF frequencies, efforts are being made to improve the quality factor by multilayer techniques and leaving a space between the substrate and the conducting lines. Magnetic components operating at high frequencies rapidly increase eddy current and hysteresis losses in the magnetic core as the operating frequency increases. The micromachining techniques provide several approaches for the miniaturization of inductors operating at high frequencies. In the present work, we have realized millimeter-size RF inductors on silicon using the same coil as before and Ni-Zn ferrite plates. The coils are assembled with magnetic cover plates of commercially available bulk Ni-Zn ferrites of high resistivity. Using the magnetic flux-amplifying ferrite plates, we obtain a 40 % enhancement of the inductance and a 25 % enhancement of the quality factor (Q= 10 - 20) for frequencies up to 0. 2 GHz...|$|E

The considered system includes PV, Parabolic Trough Collectors, Organic Rankine Cycle and LPG generator, {{as well as}} chemical battery storage and thermal energy storage. The work focuses on multiple aspects of the ongoing development of solar hybrid microgrids for the rural electrification of remote areas in Lesotho. These aspects range from very specific improvements (the mechanical design of a high expansion ratio expander) to the more global evaluation of their impact once included into a complex micro-grid system. Special attention has also {{been paid to the}} links between thermal and electrical demands. The main contributions of this thesis are: – The mechanical design of a high expansion ratio scroll expander, involving drawing, machining and <b>assembly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parts.</b> – The detailed model of an organic Rankine cycle with the purpose of evaluating the improvement brought by the high expansion ratio scroll expander and mapping the ORC performance. – A building model developed to predict the thermal loads of a health clinic in rural communities of Lesotho. The developed lumped-parameter model can be used for various building typologies and communities. The model is designed to be as generic and simple as possible, and contrasts with the data-intensive models generally proposed in the literature. – The gathering of monitoring and weather data relative to a health clinic in Lesotho, and their use for the calibration of the building model. – A microgrid model built by interconnecting all of its subcomponent models. A rule- based control strategy is developed, accounting for interactions between thermal and electrical loads, and dispatching heat and power flows of each component in order to cover the demand while minimizing the fuel consumption. – A particle-swarm optimization model used to optimize the microgrid under different cost assumptions and control strategies. The above models prove that the system performs better with the developed high expansion ratio expander. The maximum output power of the ORC is increased by 33 %, and the fuel consumption of the microgrid is reduced by 25 %. For the studied community of Ha Nkau in Lesotho, the determined optimal system infrastructure is composed of PV (65 kW) and batteries (259 kWh) only, and the optimum control strategy achieves a levelized cost of electricity of 0. 202 USD/kWh.

40|$|We propose several {{methods to}} address the tasks of {{appearance}} representation, variation modelling, landmark detection, pathology classification and evidence pinpointing in medical image analysis. Object class representation {{is one of the}} key steps in various medical image understanding techniques. We propose a part-based parametric appearance model built on Gaussian pyramids we refer to as a Deformable Appearance Model (DAP). A DAP models the variability within a population with local translations of multiscale parts and linear appearance variations of the <b>assembly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parts.</b> The fitting process uses a two-step iterative strategy: local landmark searching followed by shape regularisation. We present a simultaneous local feature searching and appearance fitting algorithm based on the weighted Lucas-Kanade (LK) method. A shape regulariser is derived to calculate the maximum likelihood shape with respect to the prior and multiple landmark candidates from multi-scale parts, with a compact closed-form solution. We apply the DAP for the tasks of variation modelling and landmark detection. To reduce the redundancy in the representation, we further propose to replace the Gaussian pyramids with wavelet pyramids in the DAPs. The new appearance model is referred to as a Wavelet Appearance Pyramid (WAP). Logarithmic wavelets are adopted to decompose the images into pyramidal complementary channels, each of which represents the image with simple textures at a given scale. The complementary property of the wavelets allows the reconstruction of the object appearance from the image channels. The Supervised Descent Method (SDM) is adopted to model implicitly the prior knowledge and fit the model to new instances. We apply the WAPs for the tasks of landmark detection and pathology classification. To learn on large scale datasets annotated with only class labels and no landmarks, we propose a weakly-supervised method utilising the theories of sparse learning and stochastic optimisation. We pay attention to identifying which specific regions and features of images contribute to a certain classification. In the medical imaging scenario, these can be the evidence regions where abnormalities are most likely to appear, and the discriminative features of these regions supporting the pathology classification. The learning is weakly-supervised requiring only the pathological labelling of the data by clinicians and no other prior knowledge. It can also be applied to learn the salient description of an anatomy discriminative from background, in order to localise the anatomy before a classification step. We formulate evidence pinpointing as a sparse descriptor learning problem. Because of the large computational complexity, the objective function is composed in a stochastic way and is optimised by the Regularised Dual Averaging (RDA) algorithm. We apply the evidence pinpointing method for the tasks of anatomy localisation and pathology classification. We test our object representation and evidence pinpointing methods on the problem of Lumbar Spinal Stenosis (LSS). We validate the performance of DAPs and WAPs on around 200 studies consisting of routine axial and sagittal MRI scans. Intervertebral sagittal and parasagittal cross-sections are typically inspected for the diagnosis of LSS, we therefore build the appearance models on L 3 / 4, L 4 / 5 and L 5 /S 1 axial cross-sections and parasagittal slices. For the task of landmark detection, experiments validate the performance of the DAPs as promising in terms of convergence range, robustness to local minima and segmentation precision compared with conventional shape and appearance models. A further improvement using WAPs is observed in landmark detection and pathology classification. We validate the evidence pinpointing method on three weakly annotated datasets on 600 axial images. Experiments show that compared with supervised methods trained with labels and landmarks, our method gives favourable results trained on larger scale data with only class labels, which demonstrates the learning ability of our method under weak-supervision...|$|E

Therefore, the simulation tool {{can be used to}} model the force due to capillary condensation. Doctorat en Sciences de l'ingénieurinfo:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>of</b> {{data from}} {{different}} parts of proteomics workflow is often a major bottleneck in proteomics. Furthermore, there is an increasing demand for <b>the</b> publication <b>of</b> details about protein identifications due to the problems with false-positive and false-negative identifications. In this report, we describe how the open-source Proteios software has been expanded to automate <b>the</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> a gel-based proteomics workflow. In Proteios it is possible to generate protein identification reports that contain all the information currently required by proteomics journals. It is also possible for the user to specify maximum allowed false positive ratios, and reports are automatically generated with the corresponding score cut-offs calculated. When protein identification is conducted using multiple search engines, the score thresholds that correlate to the predetermined error rate are also explicitly calculated for proteins that appear on <b>the</b> result lists <b>of</b> more than one search engine...|$|R
