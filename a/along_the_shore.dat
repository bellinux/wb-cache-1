5|$|October 31, 1991– The 1991 Halloween Nor'easter, {{also known}} as the Perfect Storm, causes strong waves of up to 30feet (9m) in height. High tides <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> were only surpassed by the 1944 hurricane, while {{significant}} bay flooding occurred. Strong waves and persistent intense winds cause extreme beach erosion, amounting to 13.5million cubic feet (383,000m3) of sand lost in one location. In all, damage amounts to $90million (1991USD, $142million 2008USD), though no deaths occur in the state.|$|E

5|$|The Michigan State Highway Department {{assigned}} M-212 to {{its current}} alignment in Aloha Township from what was then US23 on December29, 1937.

5|$|At 10:00 on {{the morning}} of 31May, Laforey sent the boats from his {{squadron}} inshore to attack the grounded Confiante. Coming alongside the wreck at 12:45, the British boarding party, under Lieutenants George Acklom and William J. Simonds, found no one alive on the ship, but counted a large number of French dead still on board. Removing the French colours and paperwork, the boarding party started fires in the bow and stern of the corvette before withdrawing, despite a steady but ineffective musket fire from French troops overlooking the beach and a force of cavalry moving <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore.</b> The fire rapidly destroyed Confiante and the British boarding party retired without casualties.|$|E
5|$|In Charles County, the {{hurricane}} resulted in about $2million (2003USD, ($ USD) in damage to roads. Two homes were destroyed with several others damaged on Cobb Island. Elsewhere in the county, Chigger City, Port Tobacco, Woodland Point, Swan Point, and Morgantown also reported damage from Hurricane Isabel, with 52houses damaged and eight homes destroyed or severely damaged. Seven businesses were also destroyed or greatly damaged. Many piers <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> were damaged or lost, and two private community wells were contaminated. The winds downed several trees and power lines, leaving about 32,000people without power. Residential damage totaled $1.1million (2003USD, $1.2million 2006USD), with another $600,000 (2003USD, ($ USD) to commercial buildings.|$|E
5|$|Industry {{is heavy}} along the bay, with an {{abundance}} of natural gas and oil wells at all corners. Natural gas was discovered at the site in 1934, and oil was discovered the next year. Point Comfort is home to several industrial plants <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore,</b> including Alcoa, Union Carbide, Du Pont, and Formosa Plastics Corp, which contribute to the local economies. Despite the restrictions on the bay that prevent the production of fish and shellfish along the superfund site, seafood harvesting is a major industry. However, it is not as prominent {{as it was in the}} 1920s, when Port Lavaca led the nation in shrimp production, leading to the construction of a quick-freezing plant. Today, shrimping is only allowed south of the Port Lavaca Causeway, due to the north's classification as a nursery location. Shellfish production is allowed in Keller Bay and Lavaca Bay south of Point Comfort, but is restricted along the eastern and northern coast and Chocolate Bay, and is conditionally approved in the remaining locations, including <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> of Port Lavaca. A small tourism industry also fuels economic growth, spurred by the Port Lavaca State Fishing Pier found alongside the Port Lavaca Causeway. The pier once served as the causeway across the bay but was replaced in the 1960s and converted into a fishing pier of , billed as the longest in the world.|$|E

There, {{the main highway}} turns due east <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> of Barron Lake. The trunkline continues through mixed farm fields and woodlands, running northeastward to Cassopolis and rounding Stone Lake on the southern approach to town. M-60 runs north–south through town on Broadway Street, merging with M-62 to run concurrently into downtown Cassopolis. M-60 turns eastward on State Street, separating from M-62, and leaves town while crossing a line of the Canadian National Railway.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{ordered his}} first lieutenant, Henry Parkyns Hoppner, to take Lord Amherst {{and his party}} {{in two of the}} boats to an island, known today as Pulo Leat, three miles away. The island's thick {{vegetation}} prevented an assessment of whether it was inhabited, and forced the boat crews to row a further three miles <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> before finding a suitable landing spot between the mangroves. The rest of the ship's company were evacuated in the remaining boats and a large raft. Because of the lack of provisions, in particular drinking water, it was decided that Hoppner would continue with Amherst and his embassy to Java, roughly 200 miles to the south. Once there, a rescue could be initiated.|$|E
5|$|Moderate {{wave action}} {{produced}} severe beach erosion <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> of Baltimore County {{at a loss}} of $3million (2003USD, ($ USD)). Residential areas of Millers Island, Edgemere, North Point, Bowleys Quarters and Turners Station suffered severe damage from the hurricane, with over 400people needing to be rescued. Over 300buildings were destroyed. The storm surge flooding killed a man in Dundalk, and either destroyed or greatly damaged most marinas. Strong winds downed 118trees on school grounds and hundreds of others elsewhere, some of which fell on power lines which resulted in leaving 220,000customers without power. The passage of Hurricane Isabel left 3,189tons (2,893t) of debris across the county.|$|E

5|$|The Wolds area {{takes the}} form of an elevated, gently rolling plateau, cut by {{numerous}} deep, steep-sided, flat-bottomed valleys of glacial origin. The chalk formation of the hills provides exceptionally good drainage, with the result that most of these valleys are dry. Surface water is quite scarce throughout the Wolds. At Flamborough Head the Wolds rise up to form high chalk cliffs, where there are water-worn caves and stacks <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore.</b> Flamborough Headland is designated a Heritage Coast. Coastal erosion around Flamborough Head has led to visitors being warned by the Humber Coastguard to be very careful on coastal paths.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with MN28 {{on the eastern}} edge of Beardsley and heads south. From here, MN7 passes through farm fields before turning southeasterly <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> of Big Stone Lake. The lake {{is the source of the}} Minnesota River and forms the Minnesota–South Dakota state line in Big Stone County. The highway in this area is also a part of the Minnesota River Valley Scenic Byway, a National Scenic Byway and a Minnesota State Scenic Byway. The road turns eastward along a bend in the lake near the community of Foster before running further inland around Big Stone Lake State Park. Past the park, MN7 curves to the south <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> and continues to Ortonville. The highway follows 2nd Street through town along the lake shore and through residential neighborhoods. South of the end of the lake, MN7 merges with US12, and the two highways run concurrently for about a couple blocks. South of town, MN7 merges onto US75 and the combined highway runs along the Minnesota River. The roadway also runs parallel to a line of the BNSF Railway used by the Twin Cities and Western Railroad in the area. East of the Big Stone National Wildlife Refuge and the town of Odessa, US75 and the scenic byway turn south to cross the river, separating from MN7 which continues along the northern banks of the river.|$|E
