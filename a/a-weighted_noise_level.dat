40|$|The noise {{environment}} in a locomotive cab {{has been the}} focus of recent attention by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). In October 2006 the FRA established a new rule to amend its existing occupational noise standards for railroad employees whose predominant noise exposure occurs in locomotive cabs. The noise exposure rule is expressed in terms of the <b>A-weighted</b> <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> and is consistent with OSHA limits set for general workplace noise exposure. Recent studies have shown that low-frequency sound can be an important contributor to noise induced hearing loss as well as fatigue. Therefore the focus of the FRA rule on the <b>A-weighted</b> <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> may not be enough to guarantee a fatigue-free cab environment where low-frequency sound sources are dominant. This paper describes the research project sponsored by the FRA to demonstrate the feasibility of a combination of passive and active noise controls in the cab of next generation locomotives. A mock-up of a locomotive cab was used to demonstrate the feasibility of active noise control to reduce the low-frequency noise levels. The active noise control system focused on eliminating key pure tones that are typically found in the noise spectrum from a diesel engine. ...|$|E

The feature of low motion noises allows our system to work like a real human head/neck.

To guarantee the low-noise feature, no noise-makers like gear and electrodriven parts are embedded in the head/neck structure. Instead, the motions are driven by seven cables, and the actuators pulling the cables are sealed in a sound insulation box. Furthermore, statics analysis of the system has been processed completely.

40|$|The noise {{generated}} by aircraft during departure and arrival flight operations {{continues to be}} significant problem at most major airports. Environmental impacts due to aviation operations {{in the vicinity of}} airports have become a serious concern to the community. A variety of techniques can be employed to reduce the noise impacts of aircraft. Continuous Descent Approach (CDA) is the new promising technique, which can significantly reduce noise impact by keeping aircraft higher and at lower engine thrust for longer by eliminating the level segments in conventional ‚Äústep down ‚Äù approaches. These procedures (implemented in different ways) are fixed routes that are vertically optimized. With the changing traffic, conditions and variable noise abatement rules the benefits of CDA operations are not yet fully realized. Actually, at many airports, CDA techniques are implemented for environmental improvements. This article presents the concept of optimized CDA.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{identified}} by the Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) that many complaints regarding vibration problems are actually noise problems. The DEC recently received a complaint about railway operations from a resident in the Perth suburb of Canning Vale. The complainant targeted vibration as the problem, indicating that the whole house was vibrating when the freight train passed by. Investigations conducted by the DEC indicated that while the vibration level inside the house was significantly elevated {{when there was a}} train passing-by, the levels were not high enough to cause a problem, as they were all far below Curve 1 specified by AS 2670. 2 - 1990. The <b>A-weighted</b> <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> inside the house, though also elevated during the train operation, was also below a level that normally attracts complaint. Further analysis of the measured data indicated that lowfrequency noise might be the major issue. Very strong low frequency noise energy in the range from 12 - 32 Hz was recorded inside and outside the house. However, because the building structure is more efficient in attenuating the high-frequency noise, the low-frequency energy becomes more obvious inside the house. The difference between C and A-weighted noise levels increased from 20 dB outside the house to more than 30 dB inside the house. The analysis identified that {{the size and shape of}} a room might also contribute to the higher level of low-frequency noise inside that room.

The work aims to identify and quantify the effects of parameters influencing the perception of tranquillity {{in order to understand}} the soundscape and to propose a method based on the perception of tranquillity for the detection of quiet areas within urban ones. A linear model that predicts the tranquillity perceived in different environments, based on their visual and acoustic characteristics, is proposed. Users were interviewed by operators inside the areas, using a direct approach of standardized questionnaires and oral questions. Simultaneous noise measurements and soundwalks have been performed, together with visual registrations. The linear model obtained predicts the perceived tranquillity based on the statistical level LA 10 (<b>A-weighted</b> <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> exceeded for 10 % of the measurement time) the sound sources and visual elements. The perceived tranquillity results negatively correlated to LA 10 and to the presence of sound sources or negative visual elements. The presence of beneficial sound sources is positively correlated to the perceived tranquillity. However, the effect of the noise level is regulated by environmental characteristics. Perceived tranquillity is proposed as an indicator to identify quiet areas in the urban environment, according to European Directive 49 / 2002 /EC. The obtained model identifies the areas that would get a higher tranquillity value than a fixed threshold value and therefore would be perceived as quiet. The model can be used as a cost-benefit analysis support tool to identify the best solution between the reduction of noise levels and the regeneration of urban areas, referring to the tranquillity perceived by the users...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim was to}} determine, {{already at}} the design stage, the {{interior}} noise level in a new small aircraft. The noise predictions were based on full-scale measurements on an existing model. A number of models for the prediction of velocity levels of a fuselage excited by turbulent boundary layers are discussed. Predicted results are compared to the result of in-flight measurements. It is found that the Corcos model gives the best agreement with the measured results. It is found that the velocity level of the plate elements of the fuselage very much depends on {{the speed of the}} aircraft. An increase of the speed by 10 % increases the plate velocity level by 3 dB. The velocity level is also strongly dependent on the plate thickness. An increase of the thickness by 50 % will decrease the velocity level by 5 dB. Small variations of other parameters like width and height and curvature of plate have only a very marginal effect on the plate velocity in the frequency range of interest. However, the acoustic power radiated into the aircraft cabin depends on the plate velocity of the fuselage as well the sound radiation properties of the plate structure. In the frequency, range of importance for the <b>A-weighted</b> <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> in the cabin the sound radiation ratio is increased as the plate thickness is increased. The noise level in the cabin is thus reduced much less than the velocity level of the fuselage by increasing the plate thickness. An increase of the width and length of plate elements reduces the sound intensity radiated by a plate. A combination of increased width and length and thickness of plate can result in a reduced noise radiation from the fuselage and thus in a reduced interior noise level. QC 20140102 </p...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce {{aircraft}} noise emissions at airfields, this paper investigates that potential of noise reduction which can be achieved for piston-engine propelled General Aviation aircraft {{in accordance with the}} state of the art by retrofitting them with low-noise propellers and engine auxiliary mufflers. For this purpose, using an airplane equipped with a common 147 kW driving engine as an example, a low-noise propeller and an auxiliary muffler are designed to reduce engine exhaust noise. As compared to a 2 -bladed reference propeller, the propeller diameter is reduced for noise abatement. To maintain aerodynamic efficiency, one uses more blades with optimized airfoil sections and lift distribution. The new design does not exhibit any performance penalties in cruise flight. At lower airspeeds, however, thrust losses have to be accepted. Because of the reference of this study to the regulations of <b>noise</b> certification, <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> and level reductions are indicated in the form of the <b>A-weighted</b> total <b>noise</b> <b>level.</b> As a result one expects an <b>A-weighted</b> propeller <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> which is by 12. 4 dB lower as compared to the reference propeller. To exploit this reduction potential, the required reduction of the <b>A-weighted</b> engine exhaust <b>noise</b> was determined to be 9 dB by noise measurements on the engine test rig. Preliminary design calculations for optimal design of a resonance muffler show that a corresponding insertion loss will be reached without any significant performance losses.

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that noise-induced hearing loss remains the number one {{occupational}} disease in developed countries, individual noise exposure levels are still rarely known and infrequently tracked. Indeed, efforts to standardize noise exposure levels present disadvantages such as costly instrumentation and difficulties associated with on site implementation. Given their advanced technical capabilities and widespread daily usage, mobile phones {{could be used to}} measure noise levels and make noise monitoring more accessible. However, the use of mobile phones for measuring noise exposure is currently limited {{due to the lack of}} formal proc√©dures for their calibration and challenges regarding the measurement procedure. Our research investigated the calibration of mobile phone-based solutions for measuring noise exposure using a mobile phone‚Äôs built-in microphones and wearable external microphones. The proposed calibration approach integrated corrections that took into account microphone placement error. The corrections were of two types: frequency-dependent, using a digital filter and noise level-dependent, based on the difference between the C-weighted noise level minus <b>A-weighted</b> <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> of the noise measured by the phone. The electro-acoustical limitations and measurement calibration procedure of the mobile phone were investigated. The study also sought to quantify the effect of noise exposure characteristics on the accuracy of calibrated mobile phone measurements. Measurements were carried out in reverberant and semi-anechoic chambers with several mobiles phone units of the same model, two types of external devices (an earpiece and a headset with an in-line microphone) and an acoustical test fixture (ATF). The proposed calibration approach significantly improved the accuracy of the noise level measurements in diffuse and free fields, with better results in the diffuse field and with ATF positions causing little or no acoustic shadowing. Several sources of errors and uncertainties were identified including the errors associated with the inter-unit-variability, the presence of signal saturation and the microphone placement relative to the source and the wearer. The results of the investigations and validation measurements led to recommendations regarding the measurement procedure including the use of external microphones having lower sensitivity and provided the basis for a standardized and unique factory default calibration method intended for implementation in any mobile phone. A user-defined adjustment was proposed to minimize the errors associated with calibration and the acoustical field. Mobile phones implementing the proposed laboratory calibration and used with external microphones showed great potential as noise exposure instruments. Combined with their potential as training and prevention tools, the expansion of their use could significantly help reduce the risks of noise-induced hearing loss...|$|E
40|$|Living in {{a country}} with one of the highest {{population}} densities in Europe (such as Belgium), raises the chance of an individual being confronted with one or more externalities (OECD Environmental Performance Reviews Belgium, 2007). Externalities are by definition experienced by other people than the ones causing them as a side-effect of their production or consumption. Moreover, the cost of these externalities is typically not accounted for in the price of the good nor in the production cost (for a more formal definition see Laffont, 1987). These externalities can be positive or negative. An example of a negative externality is for instance a production plant which might cause odor nuisance to the surrounding neighbors of the plant. When the neighbors are not compensated for this hindrance and the plant owners do not invest in abatement, the odor {{can be seen as a}} negative externality from producing the goods. Governments will try to determine whether mitigation of the negative externality is economically worthwhile. Usually, a policy evaluation based on, for instance, a cost benefit analysis will thus be conducted. However, negative externalities such as noise or odor are not traded on a market, hence there is no market price available. Therefore, monetary estimates of the benefits associated with a reduction in negative externalities are hard to come by. Luckily, the existing non-market valuation methods may offer some relief. Currently, the two most popular valuation methods are the hedonic price (i. e. HP) method and the choice experiments (i. e. CE) (Hanley, Wright, & Adamowicz, 1998; Carson & Louviere, 2011). While the hedonic price technique is a revealed preference method, the choice experiments belong to the stated preference group of methods. The revealed preference methods, and in particular, the HP method (Rosen, 1974), are believed to be more reliable methods because they are based on actual behavior of economic agents (see for instance Theebe, 2004; Nelson, 2008). This technique assumes that a differentiated product such as a house can be described by a vector of characteristics (surface, age, number of bathrooms, etc.). The amount of hindrance is then introduced as one of the characteristics. The hedonic price schedule, that is the equilibrium price of a house, is assumed to be a function of its house characteristics. A utility maximizing consumer will choose a level of a characteristic such that the marginal utility derived from that characteristic equals its marginal price. Thus, observing the price allows us to estimate the marginal willingness to pay for reductions in hindrance. This latter is only true when all assumptions hold. One important assumption for instance is that the housing market should be in a state of equilibrium. More information on these specific assumptions can (for instance) be found in Bateman et al. (2001) and Palmquist (2005). Nevertheless, even if these assumptions hold, this method has its limitations. Estimating a marginal price for a localized good is referred to as the first stage. The second stage is where a demand function is estimated. In that case, this method becomes very tedious. In particular as information to identify how much an individual would be willing to pay for another amount of the characteristic than the one observed, is often not available for the researcher (Hanley et al., 2009). As a consequence, such estimations are scarce in the literature. However, so far most papers using the HP method investigate only one externality at a time. Not including more externalities in the analysis could, in some situations, lead to biased results. More specifically, one or more sources can give rise to one or more externalities. A highway for instance, will probably be causing road noise, visual intrusion as well as air pollution. Unfortunately, most researchers are unable to disentangle these externalities (due to correlation issues) and thus only focus on one of the externalities (Bateman et al., 2001). Quite obviously, this may lead to an overestimation of the effect of that single externality under investigation, on the house price. Moreover, this single externality might then behave as a proxy for other externalities. Other papers investigate the impact of one single externality originating from different sources. For example, Andersson et al. (2010) estimate the willingness to pay (i. e. WTP) of residents to avoid noise pollution originating from highways, railway and an airport. Few papers include different externalities from different sources. For instance, Baranzini and Ramirez (2005) estimate the impact of noise from an airport in Geneva, road noise and the impact of air pollution in general on the house rents. For an overview of hedonic price studies of environmental externalities, see Boyle and Kiel (2001). No research, to the best of our knowledge, has been done on the interaction effects of different externalities from different sources. Nonetheless, it seems rather plausible that multiple externalities have a non-additive impact on the nuisance perceived by individuals: noise pollution might be perceived worse when the individual is also confronted with odor pollution, and vice versa. Therefore, the challenge here lies in valuating the (monetary) benefit from reducing multiple negative externalities while considering their possible additive (a total effect equal to the sum of their separate effects), synergistic (a total effect which is more than the sum of their separate effects) or antagonistic (a total effect which is less than the sum of their separate effects) interaction effects (Kutner et al., 2005). On the other hand, we have the choice experiments which belong to the stated preference methods. A discrete choice experiment is a quantitative technique used for eliciting individual preferences. The choice experiment method was initially developed by Louviere and Hensher (1982) and Louviere and Woodworth (1983). Just like the hedonic price method the choice experiment has its shortcomings too. According to Hanley et al. (1998 p. 426) the ‚ÄúPrinciple problems in using the CE method are the often complex nature of the statistical/experimental design‚Äù. Furthermore, the selection of the appropriate attributes and levels is a challenging task. In addition, respondents are exposed to a certain level of complexity while confronted with the choice cards. Considering the intellectual challenging task, this may cause a self-selection bias and may lead to the use of heuristics by respondents (Hensher et al., 2005). Finally, after answering several choice cards, respondents may reveal some level of learning or fatigue effects (Day et al., 2012). Nevertheless, it is especially suited to deal with multidimensional choices and it allows researchers to uncover how individuals value selected attributes of a product or service by asking them to state their choice over different hypothetical alternatives (Hanley et al., 2001; Amaya-amaya et al. 2008; Mangham et al., 2009). Furthermore, since the focus of this thesis lies in investigating the combined effect of multiple externalities and their interaction effects, a stated choice experiment is a logic additional method. Specifically as a choice experiment also has the benefit of ‚Äùproviding the opportunity to identify marginal values of attributes that may be difficult to identify using revealed preference data because of co-linearity or lack of variation‚Äù (Hanley et al., 1998 page 416). Considering all the above, choice experiments are particularly well-suited for analyzing the WTP for multiple externalities (taking interaction effects into account) originating from one specific source, as these externalities are possibly highly correlated. In the following paragraphs the externalities used in this thesis will be discussed. The discussion will be more elaborate when the externality is used in several papers of this dissertation. Externalities discussed in this dissertation Traffic noise is one of the most frequently recurring externalities in this dissertation. In fact, it will be discussed in each of the papers. In order to show just how important noise nuisance has become, the Final Report on the Review of the Implementation of Directive 2002 / 49 /EC on Environmental Noise[1] (European Commission, 2010 - task 2 page 1), admits that ‚Äúgenerally, action to reduce environmental noise has had a lower priority than actions taken to address other environmental problems such as air and water pollution. However, as more information has become available about the health impacts of noise, the need for a higher level of protection for European citizens has come to be recognized‚Äù. In particular annoyance, sleep disturbance, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are identified as relevant health indicators (European Commission, 2010; Passchier-Vermeer and Passchier, 2000; Stansfeld and Matheson, 2003). However, noise meters do not account for the perception of noise by humans. Therefore, measurements of noise meters are very often adjusted to the human ear. The <b>A-weighted</b> <b>noise</b> <b>level,</b> denoted by dB(A), is mostly used in environmental noise measurements. Yet, to obtain a representative measure, several averaging schemes exist. Out of these schemes the Lden is the preferred noise indicator in the Environmental Noise Directive i. e. END (European Commission, 2010). This indicator punishes for noise happening in the evening by adding 5 dB to what has been observed (A-weighted) while it adds 10 dB for noise happening at night. As EU membership countries are requested to set up strategic noise maps, these maps will serve as the origin of our data. As a consequence our data on noise is expressed as a yearly average expressed in L-den and has been calculated by using traffic intensity measurements combined with data on the soil composition, air dampers, correction for reflective noise, the geometrics of the surroundings, a meteorological correction and is based on the ‚ÄúNederlandse berekeningsmethode[2]‚Äù also known as the SRMII (Nederlandse Standaard Rekenmethode II) [3]. These L denLden measures are then calculated for the most hindered side of a house by using a 3 D model in which 2006 is used as the reference year and while keeping in mind the characteristics of the terrain such as topography, speed limits, height model, obstructions such as buildings, etc. The accuracy of these calculations has been tested for in certain areas by comparing them with observed measures. Apparently, these calculated measurements are in general accurate[4]. Apart from all the above, it is a well-known fact in the acoustic literature (see, for instance, Miedema and Oudshoorn, 2001) that the same level of noise may cause different annoyance levels depending on the source of noise. For example, in the acoustic literature noise from roads is known to be stated as more annoying than railway noise. We therefore also included railway noise in the third paper of this dissertation. Besides noise, odor will appear in the last two papers. Once as odor from an animal waste treatment facility and once as odor induced by road traffic. In both cases odor was measured in so called sniffing units (Van Langenhove and Van Broeck, 2001). These sniffing units are based on field measurements by sniffing teams. This is a very common way of obtaining odor measures in Flanders and in Europe (Eyckmans et al., 2013). The computation is as follows. Several members of the sniffing team are familiarized with the specific scent of the odor source. Afterwards, they are sent into the area of the source but at a location were the scent cannot be observed. Next, they are crossing the field in a zig-zag matter (on the plume-axis) to make sure there is no adaptation to the scent. Meanwhile, these members take notes on the scent observed and their current position. The point at which odor is just observable is then set as the 1 sniffing unit per m 3 bound (i. e. the maximum odor perception distance). Furthermore, these field measurements happen several times (with a minimum of 8 times) and during different meteorological situations. This maximum odor perception distance, is then implemented in a short-term atmospheric dispersion model in order to back-calculate the odor emission rate (su/s). These emission rates are included in a long term dispersion model to calculate the odor zones and its odor concentrations. Afterwards this information can be visualized by using the ArcGis software. Another important nuisance is air pollution. As Flanders is particularly having trouble with particular matter of 10 micrometers diameter (PM 10), we have focused on this measure in the last paper of this dissertation. Even though the concentration of air pollutants has decreased in the European Union (EU) over the past decades, air pollutant concentrations are still too high (EEA, s. d.). Road transport is one of the larger contributors to particulate matter (PM) concentrations in the EU: for instance, 16 % of PM 2. 5 emissions and 11 % of PM 10 emissions was attributed to road transport in 2013 (EEA, s. d.). The importance of air pollution regulation is highlighted by the following quote: ‚ÄúThe human toll for poor air quality is worse than for road traffic accidents, making it the number one environmental cause of premature death in the EU‚Äù (European Commission - Environment website[5]). Other externalities that will be discussed are the distance to the nearest high voltage power line, flood hazard areas, accident rates and the lack of green space. The interested reader is referred to the relevant papers for more information on these externalities. Structure of this dissertation In order to understand why these externalities were selected and how they are implemented, the content of each of the papers will now briefly be discussed. First of all, the introductory paper gives a literature review of recent developments regarding road noise valuations. The paper tries to unravel causes of heterogeneity in the results. Choices regarding the functional form, the independent variables that were selected, etc. are believed to cause heterogeneity in the results. If this is true, then eliminating these causes for heterogeneity should lead to similar results while valuating road noise in separate housing markets. Subsequently, the second paper uses the hedonic price technique in order to estimate the impact of road noise in two separate housing markets. While doing so, possible causes of heterogeneity in the results (as discussed in the first paper), were eliminated. As a consequence, the road noise estimates should be similar in both municipalities. The third paper will be the first attempt to investigate the impact of six externalities and their possible interaction effects on the house price using the hedonic price method. The six externalities are odor, noise from railways, noise from a highway, presence of high voltage power lines, flood areas and the absence of green space in the neighborhood of the house. In this paper, the first set of models have identical dependent and independent variables, however each model only includes one externality at a time. As these are the most common estimations in the literature, these results can easily be compared to the results from previous research. Less common are the second set of models, which are similar to the first set however, they will include all externalities at once. As the impact of four out of six externalities remains significantly negative, the third set of models includes two externalities together with their interaction variable. This allows us to examine whether these externalities have an additive, synergistic or antagonistic interaction effect on the house price. The comparison between the first, second and third set of models allows for a quick robustness check of the results. In the final paper, a discrete choice experiment is conducted to estimate the Willingness To Pay (i. e. WTP) / Willingness To Accept (i. e. WTA) for a change is several externalities originating from road traffic. As these externalities all arise from one source, namely road traffic, they will probably be correlated which makes it recommended to use a discrete choice experiment instead of the hedonic price method. The externalities included in this paper are road traffic induced odor, noise, air pollution and accidents. Therefore, the novelty of the valuation papers in this Ph. D. thesis lie in the fact that multiple externalities and their possible interacting effects were investigated. In doing so, we do not only use the hedonic price method but also a choice experiment. Moreover, to compute some of these estimations, the ArcGis software has been used in several of these papers. Finally, these are the very first HP and CE valuations of these multiple externalities in Belgium (Flanders). References Amaya-Amaya, M., Gerard, K. and M. Ryan (2008).

A total of 21 subjects participated in the experiments and they were instructed to press a button when they noticed a sound and rate noise annoyance. Heart rate (HR), electrodermal activity (EDA), and respiration rate (RR) were measured while subjects were exposed to floor impact sounds induced by real impact sources and standard heavyweight impact source (impact ball). It was found that noise annoyance and noticeability were highly correlated with <b>noise</b> <b>levels.</b> The floor impact sounds caused by impact ball {{was found to be}} more noticeable than real impact sounds when <b>A-weighted</b> maximum <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> (LAFmax) were greater than 35 dBA.

40|$|Using {{data from}} a {{realistic}} experiment conducted using recorded traffic sounds, the relationship between indicators of magnitude, spectrum, and temporal evolution of the sonic environment and the reported annoyance are analyzed. The exposure {{is characterized by the}} binaurally recorded overall indoor sound. It is found that a series of parameters derived from multiple linear models related to the temporal and spectral structure of the sound pressure level produces better models than the overall indoor <b>A-weighted</b> equivalent <b>noise</b> <b>level.</b> The descriptors thus complement this indicator, at least when exposure is based on overall indoor sound. Principle components amongst the exposure indicators studied relate to the detectability of the sound indoors and to the typical temporal difference between road and rail traffic.

In the present study, the {{acceptable range}} is defined as the range that maximizes word intelligibility scores and simultaneously does not cause a significant increase in listening difficulty ratings from the minimum ratings. Listening tests with young adult and elderly listeners demonstrated the following. (1) The acceptable range of speech level for elderly listeners overlapped that for young listeners. (2) The lower limit of the acceptable speech level for both young and elderly listeners was 65 dB (<b>A-weighted)</b> for <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> of 40 and 45 dB (A-weighted), a level with a speech-to-noise ratio of + 15 dB for <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> of 50 and 55 dB, and a level with a speech-to-noise ratio of + 10 dB for <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> from 60 to 70 dB.

It turns out that such "excess" propeller noise {{is a direct result}} of a nonuniform rotation of the piston engine crank- shaft which causes unsteady aerodynamic propeller blade-loadings. Associated propeller noise characteristics were determined in the framework of wind tunnel tests for a number of full-scale piston- engine/propeller combinations. The subject noise type was found most pronounced at low helical blade-tip Mach numbers and in the forward and the rear arc directions. Azimuthal noise directivity was no longer omnidirectional.

40|$|Noise {{certification}} {{procedures have}} been developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization ICAO for "light propeller-driven aeroplanes" (with a take-off mass not exceeding 9000 kg). The established procedure following ICAO ANNEX 16 Chapter 6 requires the aeroplane to conduct four level flyovers at a height of 300 m above a microphone with a "maximum continous power" setting. This procedure is now replaced by a new procedure documented in ANNEX 16 as Chapter 10 where the aircraft must conduct six take-offs with maximum continuous power and fly over a microphone positioned 2. 5 km {{past the point of}} brake release. In both procedures, the maximum <b>A-weighted</b> flyover <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> is to be compared to an (aircraft-mass dependent) noise limit; both procedures have different noise limits, though.

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} of the research work is to assess day time traffic <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> at curbside open-air microenvironment of Kolkata city, India under heterogeneous environmental conditions. Results: Prevailing traffic <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> in terms of <b>A-weighted</b> equivalent <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> (Leq) at the microenvironment was in excess of 12. 6 ¬± 2. 1 dB(A) from the day time standard of 65 dB(A) for commercial area recommended by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) of India. Noise Climate and Traffic Noise Index of the microenvironment were accounted for 13 ¬± 1. 8 dB(A) and 88. 8 ¬± 6. 1 dB(A) respectively. A correlation analysis explored that prevailing traffic <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> of the microenvironment had weak negative (‚àí 0. 21; p < 0. 01) and very weak positive (0. 19; p < 0. 01) correlation with air temperature and relative humidity. A Varimax rotated principal component analysis explored that motorized traffic volume had moderate positive loading with background noise component (L 90, L 95, L 99) and prevailing traffic <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> had very strong positive loading with peak noise component (L 1, L 5, L 10). Background and peak noise component cumulatively explained 80. 98 % of variance in the data set. Conclusions: Traffic <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> at curbside open-air microenvironment of Kolkata City was higher than the standard recommended by CPCB of India. It was highly annoying also. Air temperature and relative humidity had little influence and the peak noise component had the most significant influence on the prevailing traffic <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> at curbside open-air microenvironment. Therefore, traffic <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> at the microenvironment of the city can be reduced with careful honking and driving...|$|R
40|$|A {{collaborative}} {{flight test}} programme {{was conducted to}} study among other objectives the potential of open-loop Individual Blade Pich Control (IBC) to reduce the external noise of a helicopter in partial power descent, a flight regime known to generate the highly annoying Blade-Vortex Interaction (BVI) impulsive noise. The blade root control system employing actuators in the rotating frame, was installed on a BO 105 helicopter, which was flown over an extended linear microphone array. The acoustic measurements on the ground were synchronised to the flight track and rotor performance measurements supplemented by limited simultaneously acquired on-board acoustic and blade surface pressure data. Selected test results quantifying the noise reduction potential of the IBC technique, are presented and compared to numerical rotor simulation results calculated by the aeormechanic S 4 code and the acoustic AKUROT code of the DLR. A significant noise reduction benefit (exceeding 5 dB) of the maximum <b>A-weighted</b> (BVI) <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> was obtained for the 2 /rev IBC mode; further, {{over a wide range}} of IBC phase angles simultaneous noise and vibration reductions were observed.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{the study}} was to answer the {{question}} of whether earplugs provide sufficient protection in the exposure to impulse noise generated during metalworking processes. Material and Methods: The noise generated by die forging hammer and punching machine was characterized. Using an acoustic test fixture, noise parameters (LCpeak, LAmax) under 24 earplugs, foam, winged and no-roll, were measured. Octave band method was used to calculate values of LAeq under earplugs. Results: It was found that in the case of punching machine the exposure limit value of <b>A-weighted</b> <b>noise</b> exposure <b>level,</b> normalized to an 8 -h working day (LEX, 8 h = 94. 8 dB) of noise present at the workstation, was exceeded, while in the case of die forging hammer both the exposure limit value of this parameter (LEX, 8 h = 108. 3 dB) and the exposure limit value of peak sound pressure level (LCpeak = 148. 9 dB) were exceeded. The assessment of noise parameters (LCpeak, LAmax, LAeq) under earplugs revealed that the noise attenuation can be insufficient, sufficient, or too high. Conclusions: Earplugs can be suitable hearing protection devices in metalworking processes. Of the 24 earplugs included in this study, 9 provided appropriate noise attenuation in the case of tested die forging hammer and 10 in the case of tested punching machine.

40|$|Noise {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} sources of pollution in the metropolitan areas. The recognition of road traffic noise as one of the main sources of environmental pollution has led to develop models that enable us to predict <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> from fundamental variables. Traffic noise prediction models are required as aids in the design of roads and sometimes in the assessment of existing, or envisaged changes in, traffic noise conditions. The purpose of this study was to design a prediction road traffic noise model from traffic variables and conditions of transportation in Iran. This paper is the result of a research conducted in the city of Hamadan with the ultimate objective of setting up a traffic noise model based on the traffic conditions of Iranian cities. <b>Noise</b> <b>levels</b> and other variables have been measured in 282 samples to develop a statistical regression model based on <b>A-weighted</b> equivalent <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> for Iranian road condition. The results revealed that the average LAeq in all stations was 69. 04 ¬± 4. 25 dB(A), the average speed of vehicles was 44. 57 ¬± 11. 46 km/h and average traffic load was 1231. 9 ¬± 910. 2 V/h. The developed model has seven explanatory entrance variables in order to achieve a high regression coefficient (R 2 = 0. 901). Comparing means of predicted and measuring equivalent sound pressure level (LAeq) showed small difference less than - 0. 42 dB(A) and - 0. 77 dB(A) for Tehran and Hamadan cities, respectively. The suggested road traffic noise model can be effectively used as a decision support tool for predicting equivalent sound pressure level index in the cities of Iran...|$|R
