40|$|Abstract Background In {{many of the}} European {{countries}} {{affected by}} Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (<b>BSE),</b> <b>case</b> clustering patterns have been observed. Most of these patterns have been interpreted in terms of heterogeneities in exposure of cattle to the BSE agent. Here we investigate whether spatial clustering {{is present in the}} Dutch <b>BSE</b> <b>case</b> data. Results We have found three spatial case clusters in the Dutch BSE epidemic. The clusters are geographically distinct and each cluster appears in a different birth cohort. When testing all birth cohorts together, only one significant cluster was detected. The fact that we found stronger spatial clustering when using a cohort-based analysis, is consistent with the evidence that most BSE infections occur in animals less than 12 or 18 months old. Conclusion Significant spatial case clustering is present in the Dutch BSE epidemic. The spatial clusters of <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> are most likely due to time-dependent heterogeneities in exposure related to feed production. </p...|$|R
40|$|Interest in {{the proper}} neuropathological and {{molecular}} characterization of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) has increased since asymptomatic and atypical cases were detected in the cattle population by active disease surveillance. In this respect we investigated a total of 95 confirmed <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> originating from different active and passive surveillance categories (clinical suspects, emergency-slaughter, fallen stock and routinely slaughter) in Switzerland for their neuropathological and molecular phenotype. We looked for measurable differences between these categories in lesion profile, severity of spongiform change, degree of astrocytosis as well as immunohistochemical and molecular patterns of the disease-associated isoform of the prion protein (PrPd) in the caudal brainstem. Our results indicate significantly higher intensities of spongiform change in clinically affected compared to asymptomatic <b>BSE</b> <b>cases.</b> Similar effects were in trend observed for the intensities of PrPd deposition and astrocytosis, whereas the frequencies of morphological PrPd types and the molecular patterns in Western immunoblot were not different. Importantly, none of the animals {{included in this study}} revealed features of atypical BSE. Taken together, this study suggests that both clinically affected as well as asymptomatic Swiss <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> in cattle share the neuropathological and molecular phenotype of classical BSE and that asymptomatic classical <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> are at a pre-clinical stage of the disease rather than representing a true sub-clinical form of BSE...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn France, {{implementation}} of systematic screening programs in 2000, as a complement to the mandatory reporting of animals with clinical signs of BSE (passive surveillance), revealed certain {{limitations of the}} mandatory system. Indeed, systematic screening showed that some <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> were not detected by the clinical surveillance system, implying considerable <b>BSE</b> <b>case</b> under-reporting throughout the epidemic. As the most likely explanation for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is exposure to the aetiologic agent of BSE, {{it is essential to}} reconstruct the French BSE epidemic pattern accounting for this under-reporting. We estimated age- and year-specific incidence rates of BSE by using a back-calculation method. This approach relies on the principle that the number of clinical <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> is the consequence of the number of BSE-infected animals after a known incubation time, defined as the time between infection and clinical onset. We generalized this model to take into account epidemiological characteristics of BSE, such as French cattle mortality, <b>BSE</b> <b>case</b> reporting probability, and age-dependent susceptibility and/or exposure to the BSE agent. We confirmed that the average BSE incubation period is five years and that the peak risk of bovine infection occurs between 6 and 12 months of age. The results also showed that the proportion of underreporting is the most influential parameter in the model, and that BSE was substantially underreported until rapid tests were introduced. Indeed, only 103 <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> were detected by passive surveillance up to June 2000, while we estimated that there was 301 200 (95 % confidence interval (CI) [27 600 - 837 600]) cattle infected by the BSE agent.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} key {{epidemiological}} processes and demographic factors that determined {{the pattern of}} transmission of the aetiological agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle herds in Great Britain (GB). The analyses presented utilize data from published and unpublished experimental studies and from the GB central database of confirmed <b>BSE</b> <b>cases.</b> We review the experimental and epidemiological evidence that has both confirmed indirect horizontal transmission via the consumption of infectious material as the major transmission route and provided information on the duration and variability of the dose-dependent incubation period of BSE in cattle. The epidemiological and genetic data pertaining to the possible existence of maternal transmission and/or genetically variable susceptibility to infection is discussed. The demography of British cattle is characterized and the impacts of key demographic features on the observed epidemic profile are discussed. In the main <b>BSE</b> <b>case</b> database, analyses reveal that <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> cluster significantly at both the holding and county scale. Furthermore, analysis of longitudinal patterns reveal substantial temporal within-holding correlation. Such clustering of cases suggests a highly heterogeneous infection process.

40|$|The {{epidemiology}} {{and possibly the}} etiology of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) have recently been recognized to be heterogeneous. In particular, three types [classical (C) and two atypical (H, L) ] have been identified, largely {{on the basis of}} characteristics of the proteinase K (PK) -resistant core of the misfolded prion protein associated with the disease (PrP res). The present study was conducted to characterize the 17 Canadian <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> which occurred prior to November 2009 based on the molecular and biochemical properties of their PrP res, including immunoreactivity, molecular weight, glycoform profile and relative PK sensitivity. Two cases exhibited molecular weight and glycoform profiles similar to those of previously reported atypical cases, one corresponding to H-type <b>BSE</b> (<b>case</b> 6) and the other to L-type <b>BSE</b> (<b>case</b> 11). All other cases were classified as C-type. PK digestion under mild and stringent conditions revealed a reduced protease resistance in both of these cases compared to the C-type cases. With Western immunoblotting, N-terminal-specific antibodies bound to PrP res from case 6 but not to that from case 11 or C-type cases. C-terminal-specific antibodies revealed a shift in the glycoform profile and detected a fourth protein fragment in case 6, indicative of two PrP res subpopulations in H-type BSE. No mutations suggesting a genetic etiology were found in any of the 17 animals by sequencing the full PrP-coding sequence in exon 3 of the PRNP gene. Thus, each of the three known BSE types have been confirmed in Canadian cattle and show molecular characteristics highly similar to those of classical and atypical <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> described from Europe, Japan and th...|$|R

This dissertation investigates biosecurity risk impacts {{with a focus on}} animal disease outbreaks using data from recent U.

Results showed that U. S. beef prices responded to the disruptions in cattle and beef trade caused by the <b>BSE</b> <b>cases.</b> The ban on beef and cattle imports from Canada and the ban on U. S. beef exports were major contributors to the fluctuation in beef prices. This showed that trade disruptions following the BSE discoveries in North America resulted in a supply shift and affected the movement of beef prices afterwards. The study did not find strong evidence that the 2003 North American <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> and associated trade disruptions greatly affected per capita beef consumption. In turn, a simulation study was conducted to examine the impact of major BSE outbreaks, associated trade disruptions, and demand shifts on U. S. welfare and the livestock industry. Six alternative scenarios were simulated and compared with the base scenario where there was no trade disruption and demand shift. The six scenarios consisted of various combinations of cattle and beef trade restrictions, livestock production adjustment, and beef demand shift. When beef and cattle trade, and market demand are greatly reduced in the wake of the BSE events in both Canada and the U. S., the impact on the U.

40|$|Abstract Background Various {{clinical}} protocols {{have been}} developed to aid in the clinical diagnosis of classical bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), which is confirmed by postmortem examinations based on vacuolation and accumulation of disease-associated prion protein (PrP d) in the brain. The present study investigated the occurrence and progression of sixty selected clinical signs and behaviour combinations in 513 experimentally exposed cattle subsequently categorised postmortem as confirmed or unconfirmed <b>BSE</b> <b>cases.</b> Appropriate undosed or saline inoculated controls were examined similarly and the data analysed to explore the possible occurrence of BSE-specific clinical expression in animals unconfirmed by postmortem examinations. Results Based on the display of selected behavioural, sensory and locomotor changes, 20 (67 %) orally dosed and 17 (77 %) intracerebrally inoculated pathologically confirmed <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> and 21 (13 %) orally dosed and 18 (6 %) intracerebrally inoculated but unconfirmed cases were considered clinical BSE suspects. None of 103 controls showed significant signs and were all negative on diagnostic postmortem examinations. Signs indicative of BSE suspects, particularly over-reactivity and ataxia, were more frequently displayed in confirmed cases with vacuolar changes in the brain. The display of several BSE-associated signs over time, including repeated startle responses and nervousness, was significantly more frequent in confirmed <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> compared to controls, but these two signs were also significantly more frequent in orally dosed cattle unconfirmed by postmortem examinations. Conclusions The findings confirm that in experimentally infected cattle clinical abnormalities indicative of BSE are accompanied by vacuolar changes and PrP d accumulation in the brainstem. The presence of more frequently expressed signs in cases with vacuolar changes is consistent with this pathology representing a more advanced stage of disease. That BSE-like signs or sign combinations occur in inoculated animals that were not confirmed as <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> by postmortem examinations requires further study to investigate the potential causal relationship with prion disease. </p...|$|R

This technique can discriminate between isolates from BSE, ovine scrapie, and sheep experimentally infected with BSE. Isolates of brain tissue from the <b>BSE</b> <b>case</b> in Alberta, 3 farmed elk with chronic wasting disease (CWD) {{from different parts of}} Saskatchewan, and 1 farmed white-tailed deer with CWD from Edmonton, Alberta, were examined alongside isolates of brain tissue from BSE, ovine scrapie, and sheep experimentally infected with BSE from the United Kingdom (UK). The molecular weights of PrPres and the cross reactions to 2 specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were determined for each sample. The BSE isolates from Canada and the UK had very similar PrPres molecular weights and reacted with only 1 of the 2 mAbs. The PrPres isolated from both elk and white-tailed deer with CWD had a higher molecular weight profile than did the corresponding PrPres from the scrapie and BSE isolates.

In cattle, none of the known polymorphisms within the PRNP coding region has {{a major influence on}} susceptibility to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Recently, however, we demonstrated an association between susceptibility to BSE and a 23 bp insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphism and a 12 bp indel polymorphism within the putative PRNP promoter region using 43 German <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> and 48 German control cattle. The objective {{of this study was to}} extend this work by including a larger number of <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> and control cattle of German and Swiss origin.

40|$|Abstract Background Heart rate {{variability}} (HRV) {{analysis is}} a method to assess {{the function of the}} autonomic nervous system. Brainstem nuclei that influence HRV are affected by vacuolar changes and accumulation of disease-associated prion protein (PrP d) in bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) resulting in clinical signs suggestive of an increased parasympathetic tone. It was hypothesised that BSE in cattle causes changes in the autonomic nervous system; this was tested by comparing HRV indices derived from 1048 electrocardiograms, which were recorded from 51 naturally or experimentally infected cattle with BSE confirmed by postmortem tests, 321 clinical suspect cases or cattle inoculated with potentially infectious tissue without disease confirmation and 78 BSE-free control cattle. Findings Statistically significant differences were found for low or high frequency power, their normalised values and ratio when the last recording prior to cull or repeated recordings were compared but only between male and female cattle of the three groups and not between groups of the same gender, even though <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> of each gender appeared to be more nervous during the recording. The same findings were made for heart rate, deviation from the mean RR interval and vasovagal tonus index when repeated recordings were compared. <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> with severe vacuolar changes in the parasympathetic nucleus of the vagus nerve had a significantly lower low:high frequency power ratio but not a lower heart rate than <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> with mild vacuolation, whereas severity of vacuolar changes in the solitary tract nucleus or intensity of PrP d accumulation in both nuclei did not appear to have any affect on either index. Abnormalities in the electrocardiogram were detected in 3 % of the recordings irrespective of the BSE status; sinus arrhythmia was present in 93 % of the remaining recordings. Conclusions HRV analysis was not useful to distinguish BSE-positive from BSE-negative cattle grouped by gender, and HRV indices appeared to be mainly influenced by gender. There is agreement with earlier studies that vacuolar changes in the brainstem may be associated with an increased parasympathetic tone in BSE and that abnormalities in an electrocardiogram can be detected in cattle without evidence of heart disease. </p...|$|R

In 1999, the European Union (EU) approved 3 rapid methods for the testing of bovine brain samples {{for the presence of}} bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The evaluation that led to the approval did not include an analysis of autolyzed material. Member states of the EU have active surveillance programs for BSE, which target fallen stock as well as other categories of cattle. Autolysis is a common feature of fallen stock samples because there can be a considerable delay between death and collection of samples. Therefore, {{it is important to know}} whether these tests perform optimally on autolyzed samples. The Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) selected 250 positive fallen stock samples. These had been detected during routine testing using the Prionicst-Check Western blot and confirmed as <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> by immunohistochemistry or electron micros-copy. Samples were graded according to the degree of autolysis and then tested by the 3 methods: Prionicst-Check Western blot, Platelia test, and Enfer test. All 3 methods correctly classified the samples as positive <b>BSE</b> <b>cases,</b> therefore alleviating doubt about their ability to do so. Subsequent EU validation exercises, such as those conducted in 2002 – 2003, have included the testing of autolyzed material.

Depending on the molecular mass and the degree of glycosylation of its proteinase K resistant core fragment (PrPres), mainly determined in samples derived from the medulla oblongata, these atypical cases are currently classified into low (L) -type or high (H) -type BSE. In the present study we address the question to what extent such atypical <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> are part of the BSE epidemic in Switzerland. RESULTS: To this end we analyzed the biochemical PrPres type by Western blot in a total of 33 <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> in cattle with a minimum age of eight years, targeting up to ten different brain regions. Our work confirmed H-type BSE in a zebu but classified all other cases as C-type BSE; indicating a very low incidence of H- and L-type BSE in Switzerland.

Depending on the molecular mass and the degree of glycosylation of its proteinase K resistant core fragment (PrP res), mainly determined in samples derived from the medulla oblongata, these atypical cases are currently classified into low (L) -type or high (H) -type BSE. In the present study we address the question to what extent such atypical <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> are part of the BSE epidemic in Switzerland. Results To this end we analyzed the biochemical PrP res type by Western blot in a total of 33 <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> in cattle with a minimum age of eight years, targeting up to ten different brain regions. Our work confirmed H-type BSE in a zebu but classified all other cases as C-type BSE; indicating a very low incidence of H- and L-type BSE in Switzerland. It was documented {{for the first time that}} the biochemical PrP res type was consistent across different brain regions of aging animals with C-type and H-type BSE, i. e. independent of the neuroanatomical structure investigated. Conclusion Taken together this study provides further characteristics of the BSE epidemic in Switzerland and generates new baseline data for the definition of C- and H-type BSE phenotypes, thereby underpinning the notion that they indeed represent distinct prion disease entities. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} (<b>BSE)</b> <b>cases</b> have been ascribed to the classical form of the disease. H-type and L-type <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> have atypical molecular profiles compared to classical BSE and are thought to arise spontaneously. However, one <b>case</b> of H-type <b>BSE</b> {{was associated with a}} heritable E 211 K mutation in the prion protein gene. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe transmission of this unique isolate of H-type BSE when inoculated into a calf of the same genotype by the intracranial route. Electroretinograms were used to demonstrate preclinical deficits in retinal function, and optical coherence tomography was used to demonstrate an antemortem decrease in retinal thickness. The calf rapidly progressed to clinical disease (9. 4 months) and was necropsied. Widespread distribution of abnormal prion protein was demonstrated within neural tissues by western blot and immunohistochemistry. While this isolate is categorized as BSE-H due to a higher molecular mass of the unglycosylated PrP(Sc) isoform, a strong labeling of all 3 PrP(Sc) bands with monoclonal antibodies 6 H 4 and P 4, and a second unglycosylated band at approximately 14 kDa when developed with antibodies that bind in the C-terminal region, it is unique from other described cases of BSE-H because of an additional band 23 kDa demonstrated on western blots of the cerebellum. This work demonstrates that this isolate is transmissible, has a BSE-H phenotype when transmitted to cattle with the K 211 polymorphism, and has molecular features that distinguish it from other cases of BSE-H described in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Mathematical {{model that}} {{describe}} the key processes determining {{the pattern of}} the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) epidemic in British cattle are derived that allow for infection from feed as well as maternal and direct horizontal transmission. Heterogeneous susceptibility classes are also incorporated into the analysis. Maximum likelihood methods are used to estimate parameters and to obtain confidence intervals from available experimental and epidemiological data. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis of all model parameters and distributional assumptions is presented. Additional validation is provided by fitting the model to independent data collected in Northern Ireland. Model estimates and predictions based on <b>BSE</b> <b>case</b> data for Great Britain and Northern Ireland, together with their implications, are reviewed, and future research priorities discussed...|$|R
50|$|BSE was a known {{disease of}} cattle {{but there had}} been no cases in British humans until 1993. They were farmers with {{infected}} dairy herds but it was unclear where the disease originated. Between 1992 and 1993 <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> in animals exceeded 100,000 then the incidence began to fall. The first known human victim of variant CJD died 21 May 1995 and 10 months later in March 1996 the British government acknowledged there is a link between the human disease and the cattle disease. The European Commission announced a worldwide ban on British beef exports and by April 1996 the British government responded with a plan to slaughter all cattle over the age of 30 months. In 2000 {{there seemed to be no}} more cases in humans.|$|R
50|$|Yates oversaw a {{particularly}} difficult period for Irish agriculture.

When John Bruton resigned as leader of Fine Gael in January 2001, there was much speculation that Yates would be a contender for the vacant position. Instead, he announced to his colleagues that he was leaving full-time politics to concentrate on his family and business interests and that he would not be contesting the next general election.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The spatial {{heterogeneity}} of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) was analysed on the 84 cases confirmed in western France (WF) between August and December 2000, when both the Mandatory Reporting System and an active surveillance on cattle at risk were running. Ninetyfour {{percent of these}} cases were born between June 1993 and June 1996, and we analysed the location at birth. One disease mapping and two clustering methods (Scan of Kulldorff and the method of Besag and Newell) were used. In order to attenuate the contrasts artificially created by the standard disease mapping method (over-dispersion), we estimated the Standard Incidence Ratio (SIR) with a Bayesian method (Poisson-Gamma model) allowing a smoothing of the estimators. The geographical location of interest was the “canton”, that divided the total area into 526 geographical units. The background population (2. 6 million cattle) {{was obtained from the}} Agricultural Census 2000. We tested the hypothesis of a homogenous spatial distribution of the BSE risk where the expected number of <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> per unit area was obtained by applying the overall BSE rate in WF to each “canton”, standardised on the type of breed, dairy versus beef suckler. The SIR ranged from 0. 80 to 2. 18 and the spatial distribution of <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> was significantly heterogeneous. Two spatial clusters were detected with the spatial scan statistics of Kulldorff and the method of Besag and Newell (18 to 20 observed BSE-cases per cluster with a radius of 45 km) centred on the “département ” of Côtesd’Armor and Mayenne. Another cluster was detected with the method of Besag and Newell (9 observed BSE-cases) in the “département ” of Finistère.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{majority}} of atypical {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} (<b>BSE)</b> <b>cases</b> so far identified worldwide have been detected by active surveillance. Consequently the volume and quality of material available for detailed characterisation is very limiting. Here we report on a small transmission study of both atypical forms, H- and L-type BSE, in cattle to provide tissue for test evaluation and research, and to generate clinical, molecular and pathological data in a standardised way to enable more robust comparison of the two variants with particular reference to those aspects most relevant to case ascertainment and confirmatory diagnosis within existing regulated surveillance programmes. Results Two groups of four cattle, intracerebrally inoculated with L-type or H-type BSE, all presented with a nervous disease form with some similarities to classical BSE, which progressed to a more dull form in one animal from each group. Difficulty rising was a consistent feature of both disease forms and not seen in two BSE-free, non-inoculated cattle that served as controls. The pathology and molecular characteristics were distinct from classical BSE, and broadly consistent with published data, but with some variation in the pathological characteristics. Both atypical BSE types were readily detectable as BSE by current confirmatory methods using the medulla brain region at the obex, but making a clear diagnostic distinction between the forms was not consistently straightforward in this brain region. Cerebellum proved a more reliable sample for discrimination when using immunohistochemistry. Conclusions The prominent feature of difficulty rising in atypical <b>BSE</b> <b>cases</b> may explain the detection of naturally occurring cases in emergency slaughter cattle and fallen stock. Current confirmatory diagnostic methods are effective {{for the detection of}} such atypical cases, but consistently and correctly identifying the variant forms may require modifications to the sampling regimes and methods that are currently in use. </p...|$|R
