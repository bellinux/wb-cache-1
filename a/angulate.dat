25|$|Gulella systemanaturae is {{characterized}} by a medium-sized shell with little prominent costulation, seven to seven and three-quarter whorls and fourfold apertural dentition consisting of angular lamella, labral process, and outer and inner columellar processes; labrum sharply <b>angulate</b> at its point of attachment to the body whorl near the angular lamella.|$|E
25|$|Upperside dark cupreous red, glossy and shining. Forewing: base irrorated with dusky scales; costa {{edged with}} a narrow, {{inwardly}} jagged, jet-black band that broadens to the apex, thence continued along the termen, decreasing in width to the tornus; opposite the apex the inner {{edge of the}} black is acutely <b>angulate.</b> Hindwing: base and dorsum broadly but slightly irrorated (sprinkled) with dusky scales; costa narrowly, dorsal margin more broadly pale; termen very narrowly and evenly margined with black.|$|E
40|$|<b>Angulated</b> lesions {{have been}} shown to be {{associated}} with abrupt closure or periprocedural myocardial injury. In particular, when disease is present at the level of the <b>angulated</b> or bifurcated lesion, balloon dilatation may help in wire crossing but it may also cause branch occlusion. Several methods and devices have been described to manipulate coronary guidewires across <b>angulated</b> and bifurcated lesions. This case report describes a highly <b>angulated</b> coronary bifurcated lesion where, after the failure of multiple wires to cross the lesion toward the main branch, it was successfully crossed after excimer laser debulking, which facilitated the wire crossing into the main branch, without causing branch occlusion. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} Hoberman's linkage {{consisting}} {{of a series of}} scissor like elements connected by revolute joints. Because every Hoberman's <b>angulated</b> element subtends a constant angle during the motion, every <b>angulated</b> link was assumed as a PRRP linkage which has two prismatic joints and two revolute joints. Therefore, the two PRRP linkages of the Hoberman's <b>angulated</b> element are individually movable with a single degree of freedom. The mobility was investigated with the method based on the screw theory. It has been proved that the Hoberman's <b>angulated</b> element is movable because the terminal constraints exerted to the common joint by the two linkages are equal...|$|R

25|$|The {{species is}} {{particularly}} characterized by its double columellar {{processes in the}} apertural dentition, a splendid discriminating character in shell morphology in this group. In addition, the labrum is sharply <b>angulate</b> at its point of attachment to the body whorl near the angular lamella. This may be an overlooked character as {{this has not been}} checked or noticed in other taxa with similar types of shell until the type description of Gulella systemanaturae. Also, sometimes the labrum is very slightly concave where it joins the body whorl on the columellar side.|$|E
25|$|Male and female. Upperside: ground colour {{a bright}} purple, the subhyaline (almost glass-like) white spots near {{the apex of}} cell in the forewing more opaque, the broad discal band of large white spots proportionately more basal further from the termen and very irregular, the spots, {{especially}} towards the hinder part of the wing, more widely separated, the spot in interspace 5 more acutely triangular and smaller, the two spots above shifted obliquely inwards towards the costa, making the outer margin of the discal band <b>angulate</b> at interspaces 5 and 6. Hindwing: the postdiscal and subterminal markings broader and more diffuse than in P. gambrisius, giving a dark shade to {{the whole of the}} apical half of the wing.|$|E
25|$|Upperside: ground colour {{similar but}} of a {{slightly}} paler shade in all the specimens I have seen. Forewing: costal and terminal margins edged more broadly with black than in thetis, the inner margin of this colour forms a regular strongly curved arch from base of wing to tornus, not <b>angulate</b> at all opposite apex of wing, the edging of the costal margin not jagged on the inner side. Hindwing: the costal margin not pale but somewhat broadly dusky black; the terminal black edging broader than in thetis, not linear, produced for a very short distance up each vein. The irroration of dusky scales at the bases of both forewings and hindwings and along the dorsal area of the hindwing heavier and more broadly diffused, especially on the latter. Underside: as in the typical form. Antenna, head, thorax and abdomen similar.|$|E
50|$|The larvae {{are rather}} stout, almost of equal {{thickness}} throughout, armed with strong branched spines; sometimes with two short, similar spines on head. The pupae are moderately <b>angulated,</b> with raised tubercles on the back, head slightly bifid. Sometimes hardly <b>angulated,</b> the anterior portions more rounded.|$|R
50|$|The {{forewings}} are pale ocherous, with brownish dusting and {{an irregular}} <b>angulated</b> creamy white fascia before the middle, {{as well as}} a faintly defined narrower acutely <b>angulated</b> fascia at two-thirds. The basal third of the wing is ocherous. The hindwings are yellowish white, with fuscous dusting.|$|R

25|$|The {{shell is}} medium-sized, {{cylindriform}} to subcylindriform, greatest width {{at about the}} middle of the shell, glossy and transparent when fresh, with narrowly open umbilicus to more or less rimate. Spire produced, sides straight to very slightly convex and (sub)parallel, apex obtusely conical. Whorls seven to seven and three-quarters, very slightly convex, covered with fairly close, straight, oblique and little prominent costulae, interstices wider than (at most as wide as) costulae, smooth but with clear traces of spiral sculpture, apical whorls smooth with faint traces of spiral engraving; sutures fairly shallow to somewhat incised, crenellate. Labrum incrassate and reflected, sharply <b>angulate</b> at its point of attachment to the body whorl near the angular lamella. The aperture is fairly large, roughly triangular in shape, little obstructed by fourfold dentition: a strong, almost perpendicular, inrunning angular lamella, (almost) free from apex of labrum; a more or less horizontal, triangular mid-labral process, protruding as far as angular lamella, corresponding to noticeable outside depression; a small, but noticeable superficial tubercle above or on {{the middle of the}} columella; a deeply situated, little prominent, almost vertical, inside columellar process.|$|E
25|$|The red {{imported}} ant can be misidentified as the similar-looking S. richteri. The {{two species}} {{can be distinguished}} from each other through morphological examinations of the head, thorax, and postpetiole. In S. richteri, {{the sides of the}} head are broadly elliptical and the cordate shape seen in the red imported fire ant is absent. The region of the occipital lobes that are situated nearby the midline and occipital excision appear more crease-like in S. richteri than it does in the red imported fire ant. The scapes of S. richteri are longer than they are in the red imported fire ant, and the pronotum has strong <b>angulate</b> shoulders. Such character is almost absent in the red imported fire ant. A shallow but sunken area is only known in the larger workers of S. richteri, which is located in the posterior region of the dorsum of the pronotum. This feature is completely absent in larger red imported fire ant workers. The red imported fire ant's promesonotum is strongly convex, whereas this feature is weakly convex in S. richteri. Upon examination, the base of the propodeum is elongated and straight in S. richteri, while convex and shorter in the red imported fire ant. It also has a wide postpetiole with either straight or diverging sides. The postpetiole in S. richteri is narrower with converging sides. In S. richteri, the transverse impression on the posterodorsal portion of the postpetiole is strong, but weak or absent in the red imported fire ant. As well as that, S. richteri workers are 15% larger than red imported fire ant workers, are blackish-brown, and have a yellow stripe on the dorsal side of the gaster.|$|E
