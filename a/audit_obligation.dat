The {{purpose of this}} paper is to examine what effects an abolition of the <b>audit</b> <b>obligation</b> for small joint-stock companies can have on the Swedish tax department regarding economic crime. An angel on the report is to examine how the tax department uses adverse auditor’s reports. The paper’s method is a qualitative study, consisting of two semi-structured interviews with personnel at the tax department in Örebro. The first interview took place at the tax department’s crime division and the second one at the fiscal division. Secondary sources as books, articles and web pages have also been used. Our investigation shows that the adverse auditor’s report has no higher importance in the fight against economic crime. The adverse auditor’s report is only a parameter amongst many and it only serves as a confirmation on suspected crime. Therefore will the tax department’s procedures not be affected...|$|E
40|$|In 2010 the <b>audit</b> <b>obligation</b> law {{changed in}} Sweden. Since the {{amendment}} of the auditing regulation, many companies have {{chosen not to}} hire an auditor. Thereafter it has been questioned how enterprises can support the legitimacy of their financial information if it has not been audited. The {{purpose of this study was}} to address legitimacy concerns that companies experience with auditing, from a growth perspective. Since the abolishing of the <b>audit</b> <b>obligation,</b> business owners have had time to take a stand about auditing which has made it possible to conduct a study on this. To complete the study theoretically, theories about auditing, legitimacy and growth have been reviewed. To complete the study empirically, semi-structured interviews with entrepreneurs have been performed. Furthermore, the collected empirically material was compared with the theoretical framework to allow conclusions to be drawn. The results show that auditing contributes to economic legitimacy, legitimacy through coercive isomorphism, procedural, structural and personal legitimacy. Additionally, the results show business owners have a lack of knowledge about auditing and the difference between auditors and accountingconsultants' duties.

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} outline {{the reason why}} public limited firms choose to bear the cost of {{auditing}} despite the annulation of legal requirements. The aim is to provide an overview and {{a better understanding of}} the decisions made by such firms. My research work focuses solely on the dentistry branch. Relevant data has been collected through interviews and adequate scientific theories are implemented to canvas and analyse the reality of auditing for public limited firms working with dental services. The background knowledge contains historical aspects and the importance of <b>audit</b> <b>obligations</b> together with the fact that the law no longer regulates these conditions. To begin with, the regulations were institutionalised in order to prevent financial and fiscal criminality and offence, in public limited companies. The annual audits were supervised and carried out by impartial units in accordance to existing law enactments. The theme of this study revolves around the uprooting of <b>audit</b> <b>obligations</b> for public limited companies and reasons its way through the choices made by firms after that. The paradigmatic revocation was motivated by cost reduction and liberty of choice for smaller public limited corporations. I intend to examine and elaborate various key factors that play a vital role alongside the facilitating ones that have affected the choices made by the researched firms...|$|R

Kontrollen har tagits från revisorerna utan att ersättas av någon annan. Antalet anmälningar av ekobrott har under de senaste åren ökat, men samtidigt har antalet aktiebolag ökat. Det är en pågående debatt kring hur Ekobrottsmyndighetens rapport från år 2016, om revisionspliktens avskaffande och ekobrott, ska tolkas och många är oense. Syfte Syftet med studien är att beskriva hur Ekobrottsmyndigheten, Skatteverket, revisorer och redovisningskonsulter ser på ett eventuellt samband mellan avskaffandet av revisionsplikten och ekobrott. Metod Detta är en kvalitativ studie utifrån ett deduktivt synsätt. Den empiriska datan grundar sig på primärdata som samlats in genom semistrukturerade intervjuer. Slutsats Studien resulterar i att Ekobrottsmyndigheten ser ett samband mellan oavsiktliga ekobrott och revisionspliktens avskaffande, men inte gällande avsiktliga ekobrott. Skatteverket och revisorer ser ett klart samband mellan avskaffandet av revisionsplikten och ekobrott. Redovisningskonsulterna ser däremot inget samband.

As a result, {{the quality of}} annual reports has fallen significant. The control has been taken from the auditors without being replaced by another. The number of notifications of economic crime has increased in the recent years, {{but at the same}} time the companies have increased. There is an ongoing debate about how the Swedish National Economic Crimes Bureaus report from year 2016, about the abolition of the <b>audit</b> <b>obligation</b> and economic crime, should be interpreted and many disagree.

40|$|Energy {{management}} {{is becoming increasingly}} important for organizations due to legislative, environmental, and economic causes. The Act on Energy Efficiency came into force in Finland on 1 st January 2015. One of the law’s obligations requires large enterprises to enhance and report their energy efficiency performance with an energy audit every four years. However, a large company can be exempted from the energy <b>audit</b> <b>obligation</b> in three ways under the Finnish law. The {{aim of this study}} is to discover the best solution for the target organization to meet the obligations posed by The Act on Energy Efficiency. The options considered in this study are: 1) performing energy audit as the law requires, 2) implementing and certifying EES+ energy management system with the ISO 14001 environmental management system in place, and 3) implementing a non-certified EES+ with the voluntary energy efficiency agreement. Previous research has widely studied environmental and quality management systems. However, energy management systems are a more recent phenomenon where little research is conducted. Moreover, research on integrating environmental and energy management systems appears to be non-existent which indicates a clear research gap in the field. This research was conducted as a qualitative case study. Data mainly consists of the law’s and EES+ system’s requirements, and the target company’s internal material. The analysis was conducted utilizing content analysis method, but also comparative analysis was applied when comparing the options’ requirements and measures needed. The results of this study clearly indicate that the most suitable option for the target organization is to implement the uncertified EES+ system with the voluntary energy efficiency agreement. However, as the target organization has already the ISO 14001 environmental management system in place, it would seem more reasonable to integrate the EES+ into the existing ISO 14001 instead of having two separate management systems...|$|E
40|$|Not for Profit Organizations (NPOs) are {{the subject}} {{in the middle of}} a {{relevant}} debate by scholars, politicians and public opinion and some efforts were done to measure economic dimensions of “third sector” by Research centres and international institutions while there is a remarkable lack of homogeneity concerning NPOs’ accounting regulation in the European Union. Each country has its own accounting regulatory system, strongly depending by civil and tax laws; this reduces both NPO’s disclosure and prevents scholars to comprehend the real state of social economy system at European level and their financial performance. Moreover it makes NPOs’ chance to operate in a foreign country into the enlarged EU very difficult and make difficult an homogeneity in NPOs treatment at European level. A European agenda to support the accountability development in the third sector should define a minimum common framework for institutional and governance features, financial accounting and social accountability for different kinds of NPO, beginning starting from the different national regulations. In particular an hypothesys of “European NPOss’ framework” for financial reporting (a first step to a better accountability) hasve to consider different regulations in order to: a) legal entities form in which NPOs arehave constituted instituted in EU countries end and their regulations (specific for NPOs or general for commercial entities); b) accounting and <b>auditing</b> <b>obligations</b> (keep accounting records, prepare annual accounts, provide financial reporting) and audit them; c) mandatory annual report provided by the NPOs (mission statement, asset and liability statement, statement of financial activities, explanatory notes, trustees report) d) disclosure of accounts disclosure (make the accounts available to the public on request or deposit it in a public register); e) accounting principles for NPOs (cash or accrual basis, light regulation for smaller entities, Ifrs implementation); f) a model for NPOs financial performance evaluation based on financial statement (significant ratio in accounting aggregates; To define a common framework we start from a comparationmatching between Spanish, Italian, and English regulations (law and practice) applied to NPOs to highlight similarities and differences.

40|$|Financial {{reporting}} and audit activities are the areas {{to ensure the}} legitimacy of the everyday economic activities of the accounting entities. Financial reporting provides information on the past periods of the accounting entities; the audit activity is used to verify the accuracy of the recorded information and an assessment is given to the financial position of the audited entities. Auditing of financial statements prepared on the basis of historical financial information, results in increased reliability of the economic environment and stability of the financial environment of the state. The objective of this research was to assess the suitability of the European Union reporting principles for the auditing activity in Estonia. This objective was achieved with the following research tasks: 1) to provide an overview of the legal framework of the EU financial {{reporting and}} auditing activities; 2) to assess the problems related to the transposition of the legal framework in Estonia. The article consists of two parts, the first part provides an overview of the regulation of financial reporting and auditing activities in the European Union. The second part assess the impact of the European Union legislation on financial reporting and audit activities for the activities of the corresponding areas in Estonia. The research method used was a combined method, in the course of which legal acts were collected and analyzed, analysis of the data obtained from the commercial register was carried out and the impact of the Directive 2013 / 34 / EC to the accounting area of Estonia was assessed. Upon application of the Directive 2013 / 34 /EU to the Estonia's legal framework, one cannot be sure that the desired administrative burden is reduced, rather it could bring along growth of the administrative burden for the accounting entities, which comprises the obligation of submission of additional reporting to various authorities. The reporting process could become more time-consuming. The decline in reporting volume could present a risk to the transparency and sustainability of the economic environment. Rather than reducing administrative burdens that are the goal of Directive 2013 / 34 /EU, in Estonia the effect is just the opposite. The implementation of the Directive will result in an increase of the administrative burden and the obligation of duplication of reporting, which in turn can lead to a lack of transparency in the economic environment. The accounting entities will fail to submit the financial reports to the register on a timely manner, which in turn puts into question the information contained in the reports. Establishment of the audit limits would result in a reduction in the <b>auditing</b> <b>obligation,</b> an estimated 97 - 99 % of entrepreneurs will remain unaudited...|$|R

The development has shown that many companies have chosen to abolish the accountants and not to acquire these when they started new companies. The Swedish Tax Agency was critical to the proposal on the law and said that the mandatory audit for the smallest companies would create a major change. This due to the accountants discouragement on defects and cheating and also regarding to the government's efforts that would need to be expended. New discussions has led to whether the limit values for the law should be further increased, which indicates that the <b>audit</b> <b>obligation</b> still is a current topic. The purpose of the study is to provide an understanding of if and how the Swedish Tax Agency's control work has changed after the abolition of auditing duties and to show whether the Swedish Tax Agency is benefiting from auditing in it’s daily inspection and investigation work. The study is based on eight qualitative interviews with respondents who have different titles at the Swedish Tax Agency. One of the conclusions of the study is that changes {{have been made in the}} Swedish Tax Agency's control and investigation work. The changes are mainly the two new tools, ongoing accounting checks and information boxes in the declaration. A certain change has also taken place in the government's information meetings, where the Swedish Tax Agency today focuses more on newly established companies. That’s because they early want to come into the process of preparing financial reports and to try to increase companies ability to do right from the start. The results of the study also show that the auditor facilitates the work and this mainly regarding to the use of the unclear audit reports. But the benefits and use of these reports is different between the departments in the agency. ...|$|E
40|$|Russia {{dramatically}} {{reduced its}} {{higher rates of}} personal income tax (PIT) in 2001 establishing a single marginal rate at {{the low level of}} 13 percent. In the following year, real revenue from the PIT actually increased by about 26 percent. This ''flat tax'' experience has attracted much attention (and emulation) among policymakers, making it perhaps the most important tax reform of recent years. But it has been little studied. This paper asks whether the strong revenue performance of the PIT was itself a consequence of this reform, using both macro evidence and, in particular, micro-level data on the experiences of individuals and households affected by the reform to varying degrees. It concludes that {{there is no evidence of}} a strong supply side effect of the reform. Compliance, however, did improve quite substantially-by about one third according to our estimates-though it remains unclear whether this was due to the parametric reforms or to accompanying changes in enforcement.

40|$|Small and {{medium-sized}} enterprises (SME) are potentially {{the most dynamic}} {{sector of the economy}} and their growth is considered to be key for the overall economic well-being. Micro, small {{and medium-sized}} enterprises are socially and economically important, since they represent 99 % of all enterprises in the EU and provide around 65 million jobs and contribute to entrepreneurship and innovation. Small firms are also economically significant in all countries. It was estimated in 1997 that, there were approximately 6. 3 million small or medium-sized entities or SMEs in the USA. In Europe, where there are over 20 million business enterprises, more than 5 million private entities (generally referred to as small and medium-sized entities, or SMEs) have a statutory <b>audit</b> and reporting <b>obligation.</b> Virtually every European country has developed its own simplified national GAAP for private entities, some countries have two or even three levels of GAAP for private entities. The same is true in Asia and elsewhere across the globe. On February 15, 2007, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued the exposure draft (ED) of its International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) for Small and Medium-Sized Entities (SME) for public comment. The aim of the proposed standard is to provide a simplified, self-contained set of accounting principles derived from the full IFRS to be used by smaller and non-listed companies. Acknowledging the need for different accounting regulation for SMEs, in December 1998, The Swedish Accounting Standards Board (Bokföringsnämnden or BFN) decided to write its own accounting rules so called “K Project” for unlisted entities that would contain its recommendations of accounting regulations for a company in Sweden. IASB claims that at the present time there are well over 50 jurisdictions around the world where the full IFRS is required or permitted, for all or most limited liability companies, including the micros. IASB further states that if the full IFRS has been deemed suitable for all entities, then the proposed IFRS for SMEs will also be suitable. Or is it! Based on IASB’s statement, which leads to a very interesting but yet simple research question, which is: “Would the proposed IFRS for SMEs be suitable for companies in Sweden”? Financial statements are a final result of various accounting treatments that are contained in the accounting standards. Good accounting quality standards, according to the IASB, are those that ideally contain the qualitative trait of timelessness, usefulness and materiality. Unfortunately, the quality of financial statements can also be influenced by outside factors such as government tax law...|$|R
