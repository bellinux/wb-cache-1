The range of acidity scale of water is determined from the difference between the halfneutralization potentials of electrogenerated perchloric acid and that of sodium hydroxide in a sodium perchlorate medium.

40|$|International audienceThe {{hydrogen}} bond (HB) {{is central to}} our understanding of the properties of water. However, despite intense theoretical and experimental study, it continues to hold some surprises. Here, we show from an analysis of ab initio simulations that take proper account of nuclear quantum effects that the hydrogen-bonded protons in liquid water experience significant excursions in the direction of the acceptor oxygen atoms. This generates a small but nonnegligible fraction of transient <b>autoprotolysis</b> events that are not seen in simulations with classical nuclei. These events are associated with major rearrangements of the electronic density, as revealed by an analysis of the computed Wannier centers and 1 H chemical shifts. We also show that the quantum fluctuations exhibit significant correlations across neighboring HBs, consistent with an ephemeral shuttling of protons along water wires. We end by suggesting possible implications for our understanding of how perturbations (solvated ions, interfaces, and confinement) might affect the HB network in water...|$|E
40|$|The {{implementation}} and {{validation of the}} adaptive buffered force QM/MM method in two popular packages, CP 2 K and AMBER are presented. The implementations build on the existing QM/MM functionality in each code, extending it to allow for redefinition of the QM and MM regions during the simulation and reducing QM-MM interface errors by discarding forces near the boundary according to the buffered force-mixing approach. New adaptive thermostats, needed by force-mixing methods, are also implemented. Different variants of the method are benchmarked by simulating the structure of bulk water, water <b>autoprotolysis</b> {{in the presence of}} zinc and dimethyl-phosphate hydrolysis using various semiempirical Hamiltonians and density functional theory as the QM model. It is shown that with suitable parameters, based on force convergence tests, the adaptive buffered-force QM/MM scheme can provide an accurate approximation of the structure in the dynamical QM region matching the corresponding fully QM simulations, as well as reproducing the correct energetics in all cases. Adaptive unbuffered force-mixing and adaptive conventional QM/MM methods also provide reasonable results for some systems, but are more likely to suffer from instabilities and inaccuracies...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} a first-principles study of the effects {{produced}} by a static electric field on proton conduction in ordinary hexagonal ice (phase Ih) and in its proton-ordered counterpart (phase XI). We performed ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of both phases and investigated the effects produced by the field {{on the structure of}} the material, with particular attention paid to the phenomenon of proton transfer. We observed that in ice Ih molecules start to dissociate for field intensities around 0. 25 V/Å, as in liquid water, whereas fields stronger than 0. 36 V/Å are needed to induce a permanent proton flow. In contrast, in ice XI, electric fields as intense as 0. 22 V/Å are already able to induce and sustain, through correlated proton jumps, an ionic current; this behavior suggests, somewhat counterintuitively, that the ordering of protons favors the <b>autoprotolysis</b> phenomenon. However, the same is not true for static conductivities. In fact, both crystalline phases show an ohmic behavior in the conduction regime, but the conductivity of ice Ih turns out to be larger than that of ice XI. We finally discuss the qualitative and quantitative importance of the conspicuous concentration of ionic defects generated by intense electric fields in determining the value of the conductivity, also through a comparison with the experimental data available for saline ices...|$|E
40|$|Today, {{despite the}} growing {{interest}} in nanofluidics, the descriptions of the many complex physical phenomena occurring at this scale remain scattered in the literature. Due to the additional complexity encountered when considering electrostatic nanofluidic gating, {{it is important to}} regroup several relevant theories and discuss them with regard to this application. In this work, we present a theoretical study of electrostatically gated phenomena and propose a model for the electrostatic gating of ion and molecular transport in nanochannels. In addition to the classical electrokinetic equations, that are reviewed in this work, several relevant phenomena are considered and combined to describe gating effects on nanofluidic properties more accurately. Dynamic surface charging is accounted for and is shown to be an essential element for electrostatic gating. The <b>autoprotolysis</b> of water is also considered to allow for accurate computing of the surface charge. Modifications of the Nernst-Planck equations are considered for more accurate computing of the concentration profiles at higher surface potentials by accounting for ion crowding near charge walls. The sensitivity of several parameters to the electric field and ion crowding is also studied. Each of these models is described separately before their implementation in a finite element model. The model is verified against previous experimental work. Finally, the model is used to simulate the tuning of the ionic current through the nanochannel via electrostatic gating. The influence of the additional models on these results is discussed. Guidelines for potentially better gating efficiencies are finally proposed. QC 20131129 NanoGat...|$|E
40|$|With {{respect to}} the {{increasing}} power demand, the use of fuel cells is a probality of an effective power production using hydrocarbons as well as hydrogen or methanol with high efficiency. The author presents the operating principle of a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell and of its proton conducting membrane, respectively. Therefore, {{on the base of}} immobilization of imidazole, polymer materials with an intrinsic conductivity at temperatures greater then 373 K are synthesized. The concept of the polymer bounded protonic solvent is realized by means of polysiloxanes, surface modified nanoparticles of silica gel and oligomers of siloxane. Polysiloxanes are comblike polymers with covalently bounded imidazol {{at the end of the}} side chains. The oligomers have an identical structure in comparison to the polymers, but they have a lower molecular weight and are cyclic mostly. The nanoparticles are synthesized grafting with spacer units containing imidazole. All materials are characterized in the light of thermal behavior, stability, conductivity, diffusion and dielectric behavior. In order to examine the conductance and diffusion behavior, trifluoromethane sulphonic acid is used to provide the materials with protons as supplementary charge carrier. The flexible, glass formating oligomers and polymers have glass transition temperatures in the range from 272 to 314 K. The thermal stability of these materials reaches to 473 K. The pure, modified nanoparticles are not conductive. The conductivity of the oligomers and polymers depends on the glass transition temperature and softening behavior, respectively. With decreasing glass temperature, the flexibility of the system and the conductivity increase. Due to the immobilization of imidazole on the oligomer or polymer, the charge transport only is due to structural diffusion because no vehicle mechanism is possible. At a doping degree of 10 per cent, the doping of the materials increases the conductivity by a factor of 2. The addition of more acid does not influence the conductivity. The conductivity of the undoped materials only is due to charge carriers which rise from <b>autoprotolysis</b> of imidazole. According to the diffusion data, imidazole is immobilized at the oligomers. This is due to the negligible small self-diffusion of the oligomers. Therefore, the conductivity and the proton transfer are due to structural diffusion. A comparison of conductivity data and diffusion data using the Nernst-Einstein-relation yields only a very small part of diffusive protons which does not contribute to the conductivity. The mixture of nanoparticles and oligomer improves the mechanical properties. Above a certain mixing ratio, the conductivity of the oligomer does not depend on the mixture ratio. The consistency of the oligomer is variable in the range from brittle to leatherlike. The materials do not show any relaxation processes using dielectric spectroscopy. However, the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant can be determined graphically.
