50|$|Polycarbonate {{is lighter}} weight than normal plastic. It blocks UV rays, is shatter {{resistant}} {{and is used}} in sports glasses and glasses for children and teenagers. Because polycarbonate is soft and will scratch easily, scratch resistant coating is typically applied after shaping and polishing the lens. Standard polycarbonate with an <b>Abbe</b> <b>value</b> of 30 {{is one of the}} worst materials optically, if chromatic aberration intolerance is of concern. Along with Trivex and the high-index plastics, polycarbonate is an excellent choice for rimless eyeglasses. Similar to the high-index plastics, polycarbonate has a very low <b>Abbe</b> <b>value,</b> which may be bothersome to individuals sensitive to chromatic aberrations.|$|E
50|$|High-index {{plastics}} {{allow for}} thinner lenses. The lenses {{may not be}} lighter, however, due {{to the increase in}} density vs. mid- and normal index materials. A disadvantage is that high-index plastic lenses suffer from a much higher level of chromatic aberrations, which can be seen from their lower <b>Abbe</b> <b>value.</b> Aside from thinness of the lens, another advantage of high-index plastics is their strength and shatter resistance, although not as shatter resistant as polycarbonate. This makes them particularly suitable for rimless eyeglasses.|$|E
30|$|These methods lead to {{extended}} resolution microscopy (Gustafsson 1999), {{but not to}} unlimited resolution microscopy in the far field. The diffraction {{limit is}} not fundamentally broken by any of these methods. In all of the far-field methods, the attainable resolution {{is limited to a}} finite value. They reach a new limit, which is on the order of a factor of two below <b>Abbe’s</b> <b>value,</b> but they cannot provide a theoretically unlimited resolution.|$|R

5000|$|Abbe {{numbers are}} used to {{classify}} glass and other optical materials {{in terms of their}} chromaticity. For example, the higher dispersion flint glasses have V < 55 whereas the lower dispersion crown glasses have larger <b>Abbe</b> numbers. <b>Values</b> of V range from below 25 for very dense flint glasses, around 34 for polycarbonate plastics, up to 65 for common crown glasses, and 75 to 85 for some fluorite and phosphate crown glasses.|$|R
50|$|Glass lenses {{have become}} less common {{owing to the}} danger of {{shattering}} and their relatively high weight compared to CR-39 plastic lenses. They still remain in use for specialised circumstances, for example in extremely high prescriptions (currently, glass lenses can be manufactured up to a refractive index of 1.9) and in certain occupations where the hard surface of glass offers more protection from sparks or shards of material. If the highest <b>Abbe</b> <b>value</b> is desired, the only choices for common lens optical material are optical crown glass and CR-39.|$|E
50|$|Of {{all of the}} {{properties}} of a particular lens material, the one that most closely relates to its optical performance is its dispersion, which is specified by the Abbe number. Lower Abbe numbers result {{in the presence of}} chromatic aberration (i.e., color fringes above/below or to the left/right of a high contrast object), especially in larger lens sizes and stronger prescriptions (±4D or greater). Generally, lower Abbe numbers are a property of mid and higher index lenses that cannot be avoided, regardless of the material used. The Abbe number for a material at a particular refractive index formulation is usually specified as its <b>Abbe</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E
50|$|Trivex is a {{relative}} newcomer that possesses the UV-blocking properties and shatter resistance of polycarbonate {{while at the same}} time offering far superior optical quality (i.e., higher <b>Abbe</b> <b>value)</b> and a slightly lower density. Its lower refractive index of 1.532 vs. polycarbonate's 1.586 may result in slightly thicker lenses depending upon the prescription. Along with polycarbonate and the various high-index plastics, Trivex is a lab favorite for use in rimless frames, owing to the ease with which it can be drilled and its resistance to cracking around the drill holes. One other advantage that Trivex has over polycarbonate is that it can be tinted.|$|E
40|$|According to Abbe's limit, {{the lateral}} {{resolution}} of microscopes {{is restricted to}} approximately one wavelength of the involved radiation, here the acoustic wave. Using near-field microscopes the lateral resolution can fall below <b>Abbe's</b> <b>value.</b> An Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) which senses the ultrasonic vibrations in a sample {{can be considered as}} a near-field acoustic microscope. Different types of near-field acoustic microscopes derived from AFM were proposed. The combination of ultrasound with atomic force microscopy (AFM) opens the high lateral resolution of scanning probe techniques to ultrasonics. Atomic force acoustic microscopy (AFAM) and ultrasonic friction force microscopy are techniques which use the vibration modes of AFM cantilevers. The resonance frequencies of commercial cantilevers of a few 100 µm length are predominantly in the ultrasonic frequency range between 20 kHz and several MHz. In the AFAM-mode the cantilever is vibrating in one of its flexural resonance frequencies while the sensor tip is continuously in contact with the sample surface. With this technique images can be obtained the contrast of which depend on the elasticity of the sample surface. The radius of the tip-sample contact area ranges between several nm's and several 10 nm's. Polycrystalline materials which appear mechanically isotropic on a macroscopic scale are therefore anisotropic on the length scale which is probed by an AFM and the elastic constant which is measured by the tip is the indentation modulus. When ferroelectric ceramics are imaged, the acoustic image reveals a substructure within the grains indicating variations in contact stiffness. In ferroelectrics an important contribution to the contact stiffness results from the electrical polarization of the individual domains. Analytical models to describe flexural cantilever vibration for quantitative measurement of elastic constants are summarized in this article. Examples of application by different research groups are given...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} large scale multi-epoch surveys raises {{the need for}} {{automated}} light curve (LC) processing. This is particularly true for eclipsing binaries (EBs), which form {{one of the most}} populated types of variable objects. The Gaia mission, launched at the end of 2013, is expected to detect of the order of few million EBs over a 5 -year mission. We present an automated procedure to characterize EBs based on the geometric morphology of their LCs with two aims: first to study an ensemble of EBs on a statistical ground without the need to model the binary system, and second to enable the automated identification of EBs that display atypical LCs. We model the folded LC geometry of EBs using up to two Gaussian functions for the eclipses and a cosine function for any ellipsoidal-like variability that may be present between the eclipses. The procedure is applied to the OGLE-III data set of EBs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) as a proof of concept. The bayesian information criterion is used to select the best model among models containing various combinations of those components, as well as to estimate the significance of the components. Based on the two-Gaussian models, EBs with atypical LC geometries are successfully identified in two diagrams, using the <b>Abbe</b> <b>values</b> of the original and residual folded LCs, and the reduced χ^ 2. Cleaning the data set from the atypical cases and further filtering out LCs that contain non-significant eclipse candidates, the ensemble of EBs can be studied on a statistical ground using the two-Gaussian model parameters. For illustration purposes, we present the distribution of projected eccentricities as a function of orbital period for the OGLE-III set of EBs in the LMC, as well as the distribution of their primary versus secondary eclipse widths.

5000|$|Restrict {{the choice}} of lens {{material}} to the highest <b>Abbe</b> <b>value</b> at acceptable thickness. The oldest most basic commonly used lens materials also happen {{to have the best}} optical characteristics at the expense of corrective lens thickness (i.e., cosmetics). Newer materials have focused on improved cosmetics and increased impact safety, at the expense of optical quality. Lenses sold in the USA must pass the Food and Drug Administration ball-drop impact test, and depending on needed index these seem to currently have"‘best in class" [...] Abbe vs Index (Nd): Glass (2x weight of plastics) or CR-39 (2 mm vs. 1.5 mm thickness typical on newer materials) 58 @ 1.5, Sola Spectralite (47@1.53), Sola Finalite (43@1.6), and Hoya Eyry (36 @ 1.7). For impact resistance safety glass is offered at a variety of indexes at high Abbe number, but is still 2x the weight of plastics. Polycarbonate (Vd=30-32) is very dispersive, but has excellent shatter resistance. Trivex (Vd=43 @ 1.53), is also heavily marketed as an impact resistant alternative to Polycarbonate, for individuals who don’t need polycarbonate’s index. Trivex {{is also one of the}} lightest materials available.|$|E
40|$|Abridged) A {{new method}} is {{presented}} to identify transient candidates in large-scale surveys based on the variability pattern in their light curves. The method {{is based on the}} <b>Abbe</b> <b>value,</b> that estimates the smoothness of a light curve, and on a newly introduced value called the excess Abbe that estimates the regularity of the light curve variability pattern over the duration of the observations. Based on simulated light curves, transients are shown to occupy a specific region in the Abbe versus Excess Abbe diagram, distinct from sources presenting pulsating-like features in their light curves or having featureless light curves. The method is tested on real light curves taken from EROS- 2 and OGLE-II surveys in a 0. 50 deg x 0. 17 deg field of the sky in the LMC. The method identifies 43 EROS- 2 transient candidates {{out of a total of}} ~ 1300 variable stars, and 19 more OGLE-II candidates. The efficiency of the method is further tested by comparing the list of transient candidates with known Be stars in the literature. It is shown that all Be stars known in the studied field of view with detectable bursts or outbursts are successfully extracted by the method. In addition, four new transient candidates displaying bursts and/or outbursts are found in the field, of which at least two are good new Be candidates. The new method proves to be a potentially powerful tool to extract transient candidates from large-scale multi-epoch surveys. The better the photometric measurement uncertainties are, the cleaner the list of detected transient candidates is. In addition, the diagram is shown to be a good diagnostic tool to check the data quality of multi-epoch photometric surveys. A trend of instrumental and/or data reduction origin, for example, will manifest itself by an unexpected distribution of points in the diagram. Comment: Accepted for publication in A&...|$|E
