40|$|This {{research}} {{is concerned with}} the factors that influence the demand <b>for</b> <b>rental</b> <b>housing</b> in an area. This is because, every individual known as residential tenants have different requirements for making the decision to rent a house in a residential area. This {{research is}} to study the factors that affect housing rental demand. The focus in this research is in a residential area of Skudai which are Taman Universiti, Taman Sri Skudai, Taman Mutiara Rini and Taman Pulai Indah. The objectives of this study are divided into three, namely to identify patterns that influence the demand and requirements of tenancy, study areas with high rental demand is less in demand in the rental and lastly is studying the factors causing the differences of <b>rental</b> demand. <b>For</b> this research, quantitative data are use through the distribution of questionnaire. Data were analyzed by using the software "Statistical Package for Social Science" (SPSS). The frequency analysis technique and Descriptive Analysis Technique (min) are used. Thus, there are various types of factors that may affect demand <b>for</b> <b>rental</b> <b>housing</b> in a residential area. Among them are the location, design, rental value, household income, demographic and public facilities. For residential areas which are not constructed, constrained in terms of the provision is {{to be one of the}} reasons why the demand <b>for</b> <b>rental</b> <b>housing</b> has low although the rent is too low.

The present paper takes {{a closer look at}} the Danish development, and gives some indications of the future demand <b>for</b> <b>rental</b> <b>housing</b> in Denmark. The results indicate a future stagnant rental demand kept up by an increasing share of persons of old age and young persons undergoing education, and thus a rising homeownership rate.

40|$|For most homeowners, {{the house}} {{is the single most}} {{important}} consumption good appearing as an argument of the utility function, and, at the same time, the dominant asset in the portfolio. This paper uses a mean-variance efficiency framework to examine the household’s optimal portfolio problem when owner-occupied housing is included in the list of available assets. Housing differs from stocks and bonds in a crucial way: since the household’s ownership of residential real estate determines the level of its consumption of housing services, the household’s demand for real estate is “overdetermined” in the sense that the level of real estate ownership which is optimal from the point of view of the consumption of housing services may differ from the optimal level of housing assets from a portfolio point of view. With <b>rental</b> markets <b>for</b> <b>housing,</b> a household can, in principle, divorce the size of its holdings of real estate assets from the level of housing services it consumes. However, rental housing is by no means a perfect substitute <b>for</b> owner-occupied <b>housing.</b> We assume, instead, that the preferential tax treatment of owner-occupied housing and the transactions costs and agency costs involved in the <b>rental</b> market <b>for</b> <b>housing</b> create frictions large enough to effectively constrain the household to include in its asset portfolio the level of housing consistent with its consumption of housing services. 1 The paper focuses on the impact of the portfolio constraint imposed by th...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the dynamic effects of interregional labor market integration on migration flows, capital formation, {{and the price}} <b>for</b> <b>housing</b> services. The co-evolution of these variables depends on initial conditions {{at the time of}} labor market integration. In an initially capital-poor economy, there may be a reversal of migration flows during the transition to the steady state, while housing costs are increasing over time. Although capital may accumulate while labor emigrates early in the transition, the causal effect of immigration on capital investments and housing costs is positive. We present new data on the evolution of net migration flows and <b>rental</b> rates <b>for</b> <b>housing</b> in East Germany after 1990. Our results are consistent with the presented evidence in the reverse migration scenario...|$|R
40|$|Improving {{building}} {{energy efficiency}} is {{widely recognized as}} one of the best strategies for combating climate change and other energy problems. Energy efficiency implementation has been slow, however, due to a number of practical barriers, and few building sectors face higher hurdles to energy efficiency than rental housing. In this thesis I ask: What are the major barriers to investment in energy efficiency <b>for</b> <b>rental</b> <b>housing?</b> How well do existing policies and programs address these barriers? And finally, which strategies are best suited to overcome the barriers that face rental housing efficiency? I describe several barriers, from split incentives to transaction costs, that limit energy efficiency <b>for</b> <b>rental</b> <b>housing.</b> Existing policies and efficiency programs do not adequately address most of these barriers. While there is no silver bullet solution to facilitate energy efficiency <b>for</b> <b>rental</b> <b>housing,</b> I identify a variety of policy options that can be implemented at the federal, state, and local levels. One measure in particular, a "green lease," holds great promise for overcoming split incentives and other obstacles. A combination of voluntary and regulatory measures will be necessary to deeply penetrate the rental housing efficiency market. Finally, I argue that policy packages must be tailored to the conditions of local rental housing markets, and local energy initiatives hold great promise as part of the solution. by Beth E. Williams.

40|$|One in five renter {{households}} in Canada spends 50 % {{or more of}} their income on housing, a severe rent burden which can lead to poorer social and economic outcomes for households and communities. Below optimum levels of investment in the rental sector contributes to high rents, partly due to institutional structures which favour investment in the ownership market. This study examines the insufficient supply of affordable <b>rental</b> <b>housing</b> <b>for</b> low and middle income {{households in}} Canada, and how tax credit incentives can be used to address this problem. Three programs are reviewed: LIHTC in the United States, NRAS in Australia, and RHCTC in Manitoba. Three policy options are proposed and analyzed using criteria and measures. The final recommendation is to implement a non-transferable and non-competitive tax credit program which provides tax credits worth approximately 10 % of total development costs <b>for</b> <b>rental</b> <b>housing</b> projects with at least 20 % affordable units...|$|R
