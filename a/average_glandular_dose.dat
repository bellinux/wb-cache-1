Material and Methods: In this research, first of all, x-ray spectra of a Mo target bombarded by a 28 keV electron beam {{with and without}} a Rh filter were calculated using the MCNP code. Then, we used the Sobol-Wu parameters to write a FORTRAN code to calculate <b>average</b> <b>glandular</b> <b>dose.</b> Results: <b>Average</b> <b>glandular</b> <b>dose</b> variation was calculated against the voltage of the mammographic x-ray tube for d = 5 cm, HVL= 0. 35 mm Al, and different value of g. Also, the results related to average glandular absorbed dose variation per unit roentgen radiation against the glandular fraction of breast tissue for kV = 28 and HVL = 0. 400 mmAl and different values of d are presented. Finally, <b>average</b> <b>glandular</b> <b>dose</b> against d for g = 60 % and three values of kV (23, 27, 35 kV) with corresponding HVLs have been calculated. Discussion and Conclusion: The absorbed dose computational program is accurate, complete, fast and user friendly. This program {{can be used for}} optimization of exposure dose in mammography. Also, the results of this research are in good agreement with the computational results of others...|$|E
40|$|The {{radiation}} risk in mammography {{is traditionally}} evaluated using the <b>average</b> <b>glandular</b> <b>dose.</b> This quantity {{for the average}} breast {{has proven to be}} useful for population statistics and to compare exposure techniques and systems. However it is not indicating the individual radiation risk based on the individual glandular amount and distribution. Simulations of exposures were performed for six appropriate virtual phantoms with varying glandular amount and distribution. The individualised <b>average</b> <b>glandular</b> <b>dose</b> (iAGD), i. e. the individual glandular absorbed energy divided by the mass of the gland, and the glandular imparted energy (GIE), i. e. the glandular absorbed energy, were computed. Both quantities were evaluated for their capability {{to take into account the}} glandular amount and distribution. As expected, the results have demonstrated that iAGD reflects only the distribution, while GIE reflects both the glandular amount and distribution. Therefore GIE is a good candidate for individual radiation risk assessment. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|The new European Directive 2013 / 59 /EURATOM {{requires}} that patients are {{informed about the}} risk associated with ionising radiation and that detailed information on patient exposure {{is included in the}} radiological report.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to measure the radiation dose and image quality in conventional screen-film mammography and full-field digital mammography in women referred to mammography examination. Participants underwent bilateral, two-view screen-film mammography or full-field digital mammography. The visibility of anatomical regions and overall clinical image quality was rated by experienced radiologists. Total of 387 women and 1548 mammograms were enrolled in the study. Image quality was assessed in terms of image quality score, whereas patient dose assessment was performed in terms of mean <b>glandular</b> <b>dose.</b> <b>Average</b> mean <b>glandular</b> <b>dose</b> for cranio-caudal projection was 1. 5 mGy and 2. 1 mGy in full-field digital mammography and screen-film mammography, respectively. For medio-lateral oblique projection, corresponding values were 2. 3 and 2. 1 mGy. Overall image quality criteria scoring was 0. 82 and 0. 99 for screen-film and digital systems, respectively. The scores were in the range from 0. 11 to 1. 0 for different anatomical structures. Overall, full-field digital mammography was superior both in terms of image quality and dose over the screen-film mammography. The results have indicated that phantom dose values can assist in setting the optimisation activities in mammography and for comparison between mammography units. To obtain accurate diagnostic information with an acceptable radiation dose to breast, it is necessary to periodically perform patient dose and image quality surveys in all mammography units...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Dedicated breast CT prototypes used in {{clinical}} investigations utilize single circular source trajectory and cone-beam geometry with flat-panel detectors {{that do not}} satisfy data-sufficiency conditions and could lead to cone beam artifacts. Hence, this work investigated the glandular dose characteristics of a circle-plus-line trajectory that fulfills data-sufficiency conditions for image reconstruction in dedicated breast CT. METHODS: Monte Carlo-based computer simulations were performed using the GEANT 4 toolkit and was validated with previously reported normalized glandular dose coefficients for one prototype breast CT system. Upon validation, Monte Carlo simulations were performed to determine the normalized glandular dose coefficients {{as a function of}} x-ray source position along the line scan. The source-to-axis of rotation distance and the source-to-detector distance were maintained constant at 65 and 100 cm, respectively, in all simulations. The ratio of the normalized glandular dose coefficient at each source position along the line scan to that for the circular scan, defined as relative normalized glandular dose coefficient (RD(g) N), was studied by varying the diameter of the breast at the chest wall, chest-wall to nipple distance, skin thickness, x-ray beam energy, and glandular fraction of the breast. RESULTS: The RD(g) N metric when stated as a function of source position along the line scan, relative to the maximum length of line scan needed for data sufficiency, was found to be minimally dependent on breast diameter, chest-wall to nipple distance, skin thickness, glandular fraction, and x-ray photon energy. This observation facilitates easy estimation of the <b>average</b> <b>glandular</b> <b>dose</b> of the line scan. Polynomial fit equations for computing the RD(g) N and hence the <b>average</b> <b>glandular</b> <b>dose</b> are provided. CONCLUSIONS: For a breast CT system that acquires 300 - 500 projections over 2 pi for the circular scan, the addition of a line trajectory with equal source spacing and constant x-ray beam quality (kVp and HVL) and mAs matched to the circular scan, will result in less than 0. 18 % increase in <b>average</b> <b>glandular</b> <b>dose</b> to the breast per projection along the line scan...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{performance}} and patient dose of full-field digital mammography units for clinical use. Measurements of linearity and automatic exposure control stability were performed on four units installed in as many Italian sites. The tube output was also obtained by the same ionization chamber, permitting to evaluate ratios mGy/mAs for each available spectrum. The entrance air-kerma was calculated over a sample of 800 cranio-caudal mammograms and the <b>average</b> <b>glandular</b> <b>dose</b> obtained, assuming two mean glandular compositions of 50 and 30 %, respectively. Digital systems showed very good linearity and comparable responses. The stability of the automatic exposure control was better than 5 % for all systems. Regarding doses, the two mammography units that work mainly in contrast mode deliver, respectively, 17 and 28 % more dose compared with those working in standard mode. For the latter mode, the mean <b>average</b> <b>glandular</b> <b>dose</b> was in the range 1. 25 - 1. 37 mGy and 1. 37 - 1. 49 mGy for the 50 and 30 % glandular composition, respectively.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of new {{detector}} technology, digital tomosynthesis imaging of the breast has, {{in the past few}} years, become a technique intensely investigated as a replacement for planar mammography. As with all other x-ray–based imaging methods, radiation dose is of utmost concern in the development of this new imaging technology. For virtually all development and optimization studies, knowledge of the radiation dose involved in an imaging protocol is necessary. A previous study characterized the normalized <b>glandular</b> <b>dose</b> in tomosynthesis imaging and its variation with various breast and imaging system parameters. This characterization was performed with x-ray spectra generated by molybdenum and rhodium targets. In the recent past, many preliminary patient studies of tomosynthesis imaging have been reported in which the x-ray spectra were generated with x-ray tubes with tungsten targets.

30|$|The {{average dose}} absorbed in breast glandular tissue (considered the most {{sensitive}} tissue to the radiation-induced carcinogenesis [5]) is a suitable dosimetry quantity [6]. The <b>average</b> <b>glandular</b> <b>dose</b> (AGD) is the quantity used to compare dose delivered with different techniques. In 1987, the ICRP recommended the AGD as the reference metrics for radiation dose estimation from x-ray mammography, representing the average absorbed dose in the glandular tissue (excluding skin) in a uniformly compressed breast composed of 50 % fat and 50 % glandular tissue [7]. Therefore, AGD has been adopted as dose index in mammography [8, 9] and it is routinely evaluated in quality assurance programs of mammography units.|$|E
40|$|Background: Accurate {{computation}} of {{the radiation}} dose to the breast {{is essential to}} mammography. Various the thicknesses of breast, {{the composition of the}} breast tissue and other variables affect the optimal breast dose. Furthermore, the glandular fraction, which refers to the composition of the breasts, as partitioned between radiation-sensitive glandular tissue and the adipose tissue, also has an effect on this calculation. Fatty or fibrous breasts would have a lower value for the glandular fraction than dense breasts. Breast tissue composed of half glandular and half adipose tissue would have a glandular fraction in between that of fatty and dense breasts. Therefore, the use of a computational code for <b>average</b> <b>glandular</b> <b>dose</b> calculation in mammography is a more effective means of estimating the dose of radiation, and is accurate and fast. Methods: In the present work, the Sobol-Wu beam quality parameters are used to write a FORTRAN code for glandular dose calculation in molybdenum anode-molybdenum filter (Mo-Mo), molybdenum anode-rhodium filter (Mo-Rh) and rhodium anode-rhodium filter (Rh-Rh) target-filter combinations in mammograms. The input parameters of code are: tube voltage in kV, half-value layer (HVL) of the incident x-ray spectrum in mm, breast thickness in cm (d), and glandular tissue fraction (g). Results: The <b>average</b> <b>glandular</b> <b>dose</b> (AGD) variation against the voltage of the mammogram X-ray tube for d = 4 cm, HVL = 0. 34 mm Al and g= 0. 5 for the three filter-target combinations, as well as its variation against the glandular fraction of breast tissue for kV= 25, HVL= 0. 34, and d= 4 cm has been calculated. The results related to the average glandular absorbed dose variation against HVL for kV = 28, d= 4 cm and g= 0. 6 are also presented. The results of this code are in good agreement with those previously reported in the literature. Conclusion: The code developed in this study calculates the glandular dose quickly, and it is complete and accurate. Furthermore, it is user friendly and useful for dose optimizing in mammography imaging...|$|E
40|$|A {{diagnostic}} {{reference level}} (DRL) is a dose level {{for a typical}} X-ray examination {{of a group of}} patients with standard body sizes and for broadly defined types of equipment. These levels are expected not to be exceeded for standard procedures when good and normal practice regarding diagnostic and technical performance is applied. In this paper, we have calculated DRLs for screening mammography in Belgium. The 95 th percentile of the mean <b>average</b> <b>glandular</b> <b>dose</b> is 2. 46 mGy. The DRL based on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) measurements was 2. 08 mGy. Correlation coefficient (R) between doses from patient studies and phantom studies was 0. 90, with an average underestimation of the phantom measurements of 15 % for systems that use only Mo/Mo anode/filter.

In this study, an experiment using thermo luminescent dosimeters (TLDs) was carried out to validate Monte Carlo simulations of mammography. Percent depth doses (PDDs) at different depth values were measured inside simple breast phantoms of different thicknesses. The experimental values were well consistent with the values calculated by Geant 4. Then a detailed breast model with a CBT of 4 cm and a glandular content of 50 %, which has been constructed in previous work, was used to study the effects of the distribution of glandular tissues in breast with Geant 4.

A Geant 4 Monte Carlo code was implemented, simulating the photon irradiation from a synchrotron radiation source in the energetic range from 8 to 50 keV with 1 keV intervals, to evaluate the MGD. The code was validated with literature data, in terms of mammographic normalized <b>glandular</b> <b>dose</b> coefficients (DgN) and with ad hoc experimental data, in terms of computed tomography dose index (CTDI). Simulated cylindrical phantoms of different sizes (diameter at phantom base 8, 10, 12, 14 or 16 [*]cm, axial length 1. 5 times the radius) and glandular fraction by weight (0 %, 14. 3 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 %) were implemented into the code. The validation of the code shows an excellent agreement both with previously published work and in terms of DgN and CDTI measurements.

CNR and MGD were determined using PMMA phantoms simulating breasts with thicknesses of 4 cm and 6 cm. All available anode/filter combinations of the systems were evaluated {{for a wide range}} of tube voltages values. Results indicated that the Rh/Rh combination provides the highest image quality with the lower mean glandular dose for the Senographe 2000 D system. For the Lorad Selenia system, the W/Ag combination at 30 kV showed the best performance, in terms of dose saving and image quality improvement in relation to all tube voltage range. The comparison between the optimal x-ray spectra and those selected by the AEC mode showed that this automatic selection mechanism could be readjusted to optimize the relationship between image quality and dose.

40|$|Radiation dose is an {{important}} performance indicator of a dedicated breast CT (DBCT). In this paper, the method of putting thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) into a breast shaped PMMA phantom to study the dose distribution in breasts was improved by using smaller TLDs and a new half-ellipsoid PMMA phantom. Then the weighted CT dose index (CTDIw) was introduced to average glandular assessment in DBCT {{for the first time}} and two measurement modes were proposed for different sizes of breasts. The dose deviations caused by using cylindrical phantoms were simulated using the Monte Carlo method and a set of correction factors were calculated. The results of the confirmatory measurement with a cylindrical phantom (11 cm/ 8 cm) show that CTDIw gives a relatively conservative overestimate of the <b>average</b> <b>glandular</b> <b>dose</b> comparing to the results of Monte Carlo simulation and TLDs measurement.

Eight observers (3 radiologists and 5 non-radiologists) interpreted these 90 images on a DICOM calibrated 5 mega-pixel mammography monitor.

Methods: This experimental study was carried out in the National Cancer Society, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, between February 2012 and February 2013 using a tomosynthesis digital mammography X-ray machine. The entrance surface air kerma and the half-value layer were determined using a 100 H thermoluminescent dosimeter on 50 % glandular and 50 % adipose tissue (50 / 50) and 20 % glandular and 80 % adipose tissue (20 / 80) commercially available breast phantoms (Computerized Imaging Reference Systems, Inc., Norfolk, Virginia, USA) with auto-time, auto-filter and auto-kilovolt modes.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} digitalisation on performance parameters and breast dose of the Flemish Breast Cancer Screening Programme. Both computed (CR) and direct radiography (DR) are compared with screen-film mammography (SFM). METHODS: Data from 975, 673 mammographic examinations were collected from units which underwent digitalisation from SFM to CR (41 units) or DR (72 units) in the period 2005 - 2011. Performance indicators were obtained by consulting the Screening Programme database. Phantom and patient dosimetry data were acquired from the physical technical quality assurance of the programme. RESULTS: Digitalisation induced no significant change in cancer detection rate (CDR), percentage of ductal carcinomas in situ and percentage of breast cancers smaller than 1 cm. A decrease in false-positive results and third readings was observed, which was a time-related observation. After digitalisation, positive predictive value (PPV) increased and recall rates decreased. Compared with SFM, an increase of 30 % in mean <b>glandular</b> <b>dose</b> (MGD) was found for CR, while a similar change {{in the opposite direction}} was found for DR.

MethodsA new add-on contact area detector, which enables pressure-standardized compression, is validated in a double-blinded intra-individual comparison study. Breast screening participants (433) received one craniocaudal (CC) and one mediolateral oblique (MLO) compression for both breasts. Three of these compressions were force-standardized, and one, blinded and randomly assigned, was pressure-standardized. Participants scored their pain experience on an 11 -point numerical rating scale (NRS). Three experienced breast-screening radiologists, blinded for compression protocol, indicated which images required retakes. ResultsAn unanticipated under-compression issue that occurred at forces below 5 daN was effectively solved with minimal extra radiographer training during the study. For pressure-standardized compressions obtained at 5 daN or more, the compressed breasts thickness increased on average 4. 2 % (MLO) — 6. 3 % (CC), average pain scores were reduced by 10 % (MLO) — 17 % (CC) {{and the proportion}} of women experiencing severe pain (NRS≥ 7) was reduced by 27 % (MLO) — 32 % (CC), compared with force-standardized compressions (all p-values < 0. 05). <b>Average</b> <b>glandular</b> <b>dose</b> (AGD) and proportions of retakes were similar for both protocols.

With the standard image as reference, fibroglandular tissue and pathological structures, including microcalcifications, were evaluated. Subsequently, a series of pixel binning processes was tested and subjectively assessed on the selected images. Results: The lowest dose level at which image quality was acceptable, and achieved with a W/Ag target-filter combination at 32 kV and 4 mAs. These images can be acquired with 10. 4 % to 22. 4 % of the <b>average</b> <b>glandular</b> <b>dose</b> in standard images. Post process pixel binning added to the interpretability of such low dose images. Conclusion: This specimen study suggests that dos...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{introduction}} of digital breast tomosynthesis into clinical practice requires quality control procedures. In {{this study we}} have investigated whether {{the assessment of the}} <b>average</b> <b>glandular</b> <b>dose</b> for modelled standard breasts can be performed using a combination of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polyethylene (PE) slabs that matches standard breast thicknesses. For this purpose the energies absorbed per unit area of the image receptor when imaging standard breasts and PMMA-PE slabs have been matched taking account of both primary and scattered photons. To achieve this a two-step approach was used. Firstly, the behaviour of the scatter-to-primary ratio (SPR) of PMMA-PE phantoms and standard breasts was investigated using Monte Carlo simulations for various conditions. For imaging without an anti-scatter grid, {{it was found that the}} values of standard breast and phantom SPR were significantly different and it follows that these differences are relevant when matching the absorbed energy. In the second part, a set of PMMA-PE combinations is proposed which, for dosimetric purposes, can be used to simulate standard breasts in the thickness range 20 to 100 mm. The dosimetric error when using these PMMA-PE slabs was found to be below 6 % for thicknesses up to 7 cm and increases to 10 % for 10 cm thicknes...|$|E
40|$|The {{estimation}} of the mean <b>glandular</b> <b>dose</b> in mammography using Monte Carlo simulations requires the calculation of the incident air kerma evaluated on the breast surface. In such a calculation, caution should be applied in considering explicitly {{the presence of the}} top compression paddle, since Compton scattering in this slab may produce a large spread of the incidence angles of x-ray photons on the scoring surface. Then, the calculation of the incident air kerma should contain the 'effective' area of the scoring surface, which takes into account the angle of incidence of photons on such a surface. Using Geant 4 Monte Carlo simulations with a code previously validated according to the Task Group 195 of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine, we show that for typical x-ray spectra and energy range adopted in mammography, the resulting discrepancy in the calculation of the incident air kerma may lead to an overestimation from a minimum of 10 % up to 12 % of normalized dose coefficients and, hence, of the corresponding mean <b>glandular</b> <b>dose</b> if this contribution is not considered...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that mammographic {{equipment}} is generally provided with a molybdenum (Mo) anode and a molybdenum filter tube. The thickness of the Mo added filtration is about 30 μm; this value was most likely chosen in an empirical way as an acceptable compromise in order to avoid high dose, tube overloading and poor image quality. The improvement of the X-ray tube output due to the introduction of new Mo rotating anode and high frequency voltage generator, together with a faster screen-film system, prompted us to investigate the effect of increasing Mo filtration on dose and image quality. In this paper we analyzed the energy spectra distribution for various kV(p) settings with Mo filtration ranging from 0 to 75 μm. The analysis was performed on either an incident or transmitted beam. The entrance dose, the mean <b>dose,</b> the mean <b>glandular</b> <b>dose</b> and the image quality were also evaluated. The results show that at increasing filter thickness the entrance and the mean dose decrease without losing image quality. In addition, the mean <b>glandular</b> <b>dose</b> appears to be dependent on the kV(p) settings, but is almost independent on Mo filtration...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} breast skin {{thickness}} on dosimetry in mammography was investigated. Breast computed tomography (CT) acquisition techniques, combined with algorithms designed for determining specific breast metrics, were useful for estimating skin thickness. A radial-geometry edge detection scheme was implemented on coronal reconstructed breast CT (bCT) images {{to measure the}} breast skin thickness. Skin thickness of bilateral bCT volume data from 49 women and unilateral bCT volume data from 2 women (10 healthy women and 41 women with BIRADS 4 and 5 diagnoses) was robustly measured with the edge detection scheme. The mean breast skin thickness (±inter-breast standard deviation) {{was found to be}} 1. 45 ± 0. 30 mm. Since most current published normalized <b>glandular</b> <b>dose</b> (DgN) coefficients are based on the assumption of a 4 -mm breast skin thickness, the DgN values computed with Monte Carlo techniques will increase up to 18 % due to the thinner skin layers (e. g., 6 -cm 50 % glandular breast, 28 kVp Mo–Mo spectrum). The thinner skin dimensions found in this study suggest that the current DgN values used for mammographic dosimetry lead to a slight underestimate in <b>glandular</b> <b>dose...</b>|$|R
