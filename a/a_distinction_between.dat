The configuration of houses also depended on whether the farm was situated on a hill or in flatter terrain.|$|E
5|$|Screening devices {{based on}} diamond type {{detection}} {{can be used}} to make <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> diamonds that are certainly natural and diamonds that are potentially synthetic. Those potentially synthetic diamonds require more investigation in a specialized lab. Examples of commercial screening devices are D-Screen (WTOCD / HRD Antwerp) and Alpha Diamond Analyzer (Bruker / HRD Antwerp).|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} the possessive {{agreement}} suffixes on nouns and the transitive agreement suffixes on verbs {{in a number of}} instances have similar or identical shapes has even resulted in the theory that Greenlandic has <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> transitive and intransitive nouns, parallel to the same distinction in the verbs.|$|E
40|$|Drawing upon Husserl and Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenological {{constitution}} of the Other through Einfülhung, I argue that the hierarchical <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> higher and lower animals – which has been dismissed by Heidegger for being anthropocentric – must not be conceived as <b>an</b> objective <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> “primitive” animals and “more evolved” ones, but rather corresponds to <b>a</b> phenomenological <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> familiar and unfamiliar animals...|$|R

The differences are minor and speakers have no difficulty understanding one another.|$|E
5|$|By {{introducing}} <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> diachronic and synchronic {{analyses of}} language, {{he laid the}} foundation of the modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still fundamental in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between syntagm and paradigm, and the Langue-parole distinction, distinguishing language as an abstract system (langue), from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (parole).|$|E
5|$|During the Byzantine millennium, {{hardly a}} year passed without a {{military}} campaign. Soldiers were {{a normal part}} of everyday life, much more so than in modern Western societies. While it is difficult to draw <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> Roman and Byzantine soldiers from an organizational aspect, it is easier to do so in terms of their social profile. The military handbooks known as the Taktika continued a Hellenistic and Roman tradition, and contain a wealth of information about the appearance, customs, habits, and life of the soldiers.|$|E

5|$|For {{purposes}} of Pan American Games competition, the Pan American Sports Organization (PASO) makes <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> sports and disciplines. A sport, in Pan American Games terms, {{is a single}} or group of disciplines as represented by an international governing body, namely an International Federation. For example, aquatics, represented at the Olympic level by the International Swimming Federation, is a sport at the Pan American Games that includes the swimming, diving, synchronized swimming and water polo disciplines.|$|E
5|$|LARP {{events have}} {{a wide variety of}} styles that often overlap. Simple distinctions can be made {{regarding}} the genre used, the presence of simulated weapons or abstract rules, and whether players create their own characters or have them assigned by gamemasters. There is also <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> scenarios that are only run once and those that are designed to be repeatable. A number of other common classifications follow.|$|E
5|$|Next Stace {{explains}} {{that there are}} two orders of being: time (or the world) and eternity (or God), and these intersect in the moment of mystic illumination. He maintains these orders are distinct, so one order cannot dictate to the other. Here he says that he agrees with Kant, who made <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> the world of phenomena and the noumenon, although he is critical of Kant’s disregard for mystical experience.|$|E

5|$|The Italian theologian Francesco Antonio Zaccaria criticised Augustine's {{concept of}} {{evil in the}} eighteenth century. He noted <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> using the term evil to imply blame (sin) and to imply lament (suffering) and argued that Augustine posited sin to have {{occurred}} before suffering. This was problematic for Zaccaria, who believed that it made Augustine seem offhand and uninterested in human suffering. For Zaccaria, Augustine's perception of evil as a privation did not satisfactorily answer the questions of modern society as to why suffering exists.|$|E
5|$|The RNLI's {{lifeboat}} {{crews and}} lifeguards have saved more than 140,000 lives since 1824. The RNLI makes <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> people aided and lives saved. There were 8,462 lifeboat launches in 2014, rescuing 8,727 people, including saving 460 lives. Lifeguards helped or rescued 19,353 people. Flood rescuers deployed seven times. In 2015 crews rescued on average 22 people a day.|$|E
5|$|The most {{enduring}} Roman legacy {{may be that}} created by Hadrian's Wall. Its line approximates the border between modern Scotland and England and it created <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> the northern third and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain that plays a part in modern political debate. This is probably coincidental however, as {{there is little to}} suggest its influence {{played an important role in}} the early Medieval period after the fall of Rome.|$|E

5|$|An {{individuals}} {{right to}} privacy is one area of digital forensics which is still largely undecided by courts. The US Electronic Communications Privacy Act places limitations {{on the ability of}} law enforcement or civil investigators to intercept and access evidence. The act makes <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> stored communication (e.g. email archives) and transmitted communication (such as VOIP). The latter, being considered more of a privacy invasion, is harder to obtain a warrant for. The ECPA also affects the ability of companies to investigate the computers and communications of their employees, an aspect that is still under debate as {{to the extent to which}} a company can perform such monitoring.|$|E

The restaurant participates in the Disney Dining Plan. Meals are served starting at 10:30a.m. on Sundays and Wednesdays, and starting at 11:00a.m. every other day of the week. The restaurant closes each day {{at the same time that}} the park does, which is in the late evening. The menu is the same all day, without <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> lunch and dinner. A full bar service is available, and there is also a limited wine selection.|$|E
5|$|From 2001, Varner {{embarked}} on a research project exploring animals in Hare's two-level utilitarianism. Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition, published by Oxford University Press in 2012, was the first monograph arising from this project. In the book, Varner moved away from his biocentrism, instead endorsing a developed version of Hare's ethics. Varner draws <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> persons, near-persons and merely sentient beings; although all are morally considerable, the lives of persons are of the most significance, {{and the lives of}} merely sentient beings are of the least. The practical consequences of this view, though initial comments were offered in Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition, will be explored in Sustaining Animals, forthcoming with Oxford University Press.|$|E
