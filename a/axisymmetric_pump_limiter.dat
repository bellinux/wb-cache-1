So far only a few experiments have been dedicated to an active control of the neutral particle using conventional solutions of axisymmetric magnetic divertors or throat limiters. The alternative `vented pump limiter' concept is more attractive for an RFP experiment due to the edge plasma and confinement properties of this magnetic configuration. In this paper, {{the application of a}} vented <b>pump</b> <b>limiter</b> to an RFP is discussed and the prototype module of the vented <b>pump</b> <b>limiter</b> designed for the RFX experiment is presented.

A {{comprehensive}} {{report on the}} physics of <b>pump</b> <b>limiters</b> and particularly, the characterization of ALT-II, was published in Nuclear Fusion, bringing the project to a closure. The performance of the toroidal <b>pump</b> <b>limiter</b> was characterized under full auxiliary heating of 7 MW of NBI and ICRH and full pumping, {{as stated in the}} project milestones. Relevant highlights are: (1) Pumping with ALT-II allows for density control. (2) The achieved exhaust efficiency is 4 % during NBI operation and near 2 % during OH or ICRH operation. (3) We have shown that an exhaust efficiency of 2 % is sufficient to satisfy the ash removal requirements of fusion reactors. (4) The plasma particle efflux and the pumped flux both increase with density and heating power. (5) The particle confinement time is less than the energy confinement time by a factor of 4. In summary, <b>pumped</b> belt <b>limiters</b> could provide the density control and ash exhaust requirements of fusion reactors...|$|R

Quantitative information on the deposit volume and on D-retention are thus obtained from these measurements. Carbon probed at the tile top surfaces is mainly amorphous carbon, due either to the amorphization induced by ion bombardment in the erosion dominated zone, or to deposit formation processes in the deposition-dominated zones.

The modelling with TECXY introduces imprinted bias currents in the scrape-off layer for the case of negative (limiter) biasing, and imprinted bias potentials for the case of positive biasing. This allows to simulate sufficiently well the experimental current-voltage characteristics for either biasing and also reproduces the essential features and trends of the observed plasma profiles in the SOL.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{is described in}} which plasma flow to a tokamak limiter is controlled {{through the use of}} a local toroidal divertor coil mounted inside the limiter itself. This coil produces a local perturbed field B_C approximately equal to the local unperturbed toroidal field B_T ≃ 3 kG, such that when B_C adds to B_T the field lines move into the limiter and the local plasma flow to it increases by a factor as great as 1. 6, and when B_C subtracts from B_T the field lines move away from the limiter and the local plasma flow to it decreases by as much as a factor of 4. A simple theoretical model is used to interpret these results. Since these changes occur without significantly affecting global plasma confinement, such a control scheme may be useful for optimizing the performance of <b>pumped</b> <b>limiters...</b>|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{retention}} in tokamaks {{is due to}} implantation into plasma-facing {{materials and}} trapping in deposited layers.

In the divertor tokamak JET the main deposition is observed in the divertor, additional deposits are observed in the main chamber {{on the sides of}} the guard limiters. Codeposition of carbon ions with hydrogen is the major mechanism of layer growth at areas with direct plasma contact.

40|$|Operation of the Phase III {{outboard}} <b>pump</b> <b>limiter</b> (OPL) in Tore Supra in 1994 {{was terminated}} prematurely when runaway electrons {{during the current}} decay following a disruption pierced leading edge tube on the electron side and caused a water leak.

Here observations on the particle-handling characteristics of the actively cooled modular outboard <b>pump</b> <b>limiter</b> (OPL) are presented for helium discharges. The important experimental result was that a modest pumping speed (1 m{sup 3 }/s) of the OPL turbomolecular pump (TMP) provided background helium exhaust. This result came about due to a well-conditioned vessel wall with helium discharges that caused no wall outgasing. The particle accountability in these helium discharges was excellent, and the well-conditioned wall did not {{play a significant role}} in the particle balance. The helium density control, 25 % density drop with OPL exhaust efficiency of {approximately} 1 %, was possible with TMP although this may not be the case with reactive gases such as deuterium.

40|$|An <b>axisymmetric</b> <b>pumping</b> {{scheme is}} {{proposed}} to pump the particles that trap in a thermal barrier without invoking the neutral beam or geodesic curvature. In this scheme a magnetic scraper is moved uni-directionally on the barrier peak {{to push the}} barely trapped particles into the central cell. We utilize a potential jump that forms at the peak field for sufficiently strong pumping. The non-collisional catching effect has to be limited by setting an upper limit on the scraping frequency of the magnetic bump. On the other hand, the dynamic stability of the pumping scheme sets a lower limit on the scraping frequency. Using the variational method, {{we are able to}} estimate the window between these two limits, which seems feasible for the Tara reactor parameter set.

40|$|Particle {{control is}} playing an {{increasingly}} important role in tokamak plasma performance. The present paper discusses particle control of hydrogen/deuterium by wall pumping on graphite or carbonized surfaces, {{as well as by}} external exhaust with <b>pumped</b> <b>limiters</b> and <b>pumped</b> divertors. Wall pumping is ultimately a transient effect and by itself not suitable for steady state particle exhaust. Therefore, external exhaust techniques with <b>pumped</b> divertors and <b>limiters</b> are being developed. How wall pumping phenomena interact and correlate with these inherently steady state, external exhaust techniques, is not well known to date. In the present paper, the processes involved in wall pumping and in external pumping are investigated in an attempt to evaluate the effect of external exhaust on wall pumping. Some of the key elements of this analysis are: (1) charge-exchange fluxes to the wall {{play a crucial role in}} the core-wall particle dynamics, (2) the recycling fluxes of thermal molecules have a high probability of ionization in the scrape-off layer, (3) thermal particles originating from the wall, which are ionized within the scrape-off layer, can be directly exhausted, thus providing a direct path between wall and exhaust which can be used to control the wall inventory. This way, the wall can be kept in a continuous pumping state in the sense that it continuously absorbs energetic particles and releases thermal molecules which are then removed by the external exhaust mechanism. While most of the ingredients of this analysis have been observed individually before, the present evaluation is an attempt to correlate effects of wall recycling and external exhaust...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{analytic}} fluid model {{based on}} particle and momentum conservation describes {{the response of}} the scrape-off layer to an applied radial electric field. The model explains why the variation of plenum pressure during limiter biasing in TEXTOR shows the opposite behaviour as divertor biasing in Tokamak de Varennes: the mechanical baffles that define the throats of the <b>pump</b> <b>limiter</b> are aligned along the magnetic field, thus preventing collection of the induced perpendicular flux when the drift is directed towards the scoop. Rather, the optimal pumping is expected when the drift is directed away from the scoop due to the increase of the parallel flux needed to satisfy the Bohm-Chodura criterion. Qualitative agreement is obtained with measurements of the parallel flow near the limiter throat, and with measurements of the plenum pressure during negative biasing for both directions of toroidal magnetic field. The results, extrapolated to Tore Supra, predict that the actual design with throats should provide close to optimal pumping with minor modification of the natural radial electric field, but greater performance could be obtained with negative biasing if a toroidally symmetric neutralizer geometry were adopted...|$|R

This regime is obtained under quasistationary conditions with edge neon seeding in a <b>pumped</b> <b>limiter</b> tokamak with circular cross section. It combines high confinement and high beta (up to a normalized beta, beta(n) = 2) with low edge q values (down to q(a) = 2. 8) and high density even above the Greenwald limit together with dominant edge radiative heat exhaust, and therefore shows promise {{for the future of}} fusion research. Bulk and edge properties of these discharges an described, and a detailed account is given of the energy and particle confinement and their scaling.

This allowed us to simulate sufficiently well the experimental I-V characteristics for either biasing of ALT-II and also reproduced the essential features and trends of the observed plasma profiles in the SOL of TEXTOR- 94. For negative biasing a moderate improvement of the pumping exhaust efficiency can be achieved in the case of TEXTOR.

40|$|The Advanced Limiter Test (ALT) {{project is}} the focus of a {{fruitful}} and intense International Energy Agreement collaboration on TEXTOR. The <b>pump</b> <b>limiter</b> is a mechanical boundary that is laid out for taking the full heat load of TEXTOR, namely 8 MW (assuming 2 MW radiated power) for 10 s, and provides a pumping efficiency of at least 5 % of the working gas.

In order to obtain pumping for all gases, the ALT-II is equipped with turbomolecular pumps. A short description of ALT-II is given, and the power and particle fluxes to the limiter surface and into the exhaust scoops are discussed.

40|$|The {{heat load}} on plasma-facing {{components}} {{is a key}} issue for forthcoming fusion experiments. In this work the heat flux on the <b>pump</b> <b>limiter</b> in TEXTOR- 94 is measured by a newly developed digital thermography system and these results are compared with theoretical models. The limiter is shaped {{in such a way}} as to keep the heat load of the plasma-wetted area low; this is achieved by reducing the angle of incidence of the magnetic field lines with respect to the limiter surface to less than 1 for the first 10 mm of the scrape-off-layer (SOL). This small angle of incidence enhances all effects of toroidal non-uniformity as given e. g. by the magnetic field ripple. Extensive modelling explains well the observed heating pattern on the limiter surface due to the ripple effect. In contrast to expectations from density and temperature distributions in the SOL and at the edge of the confined region, an excessive power density is deposited on the first few millimetres near the roof tip of the limiter. Physical effects which could cause this phenomenon are discussed. (orig.) With CD-ROM, 52 refs.
