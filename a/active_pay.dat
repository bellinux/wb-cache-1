40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedLegislators, recognizing {{the need to}} increase the national savings rate, have introduced profit-sharing and thrift savings plans to civilians, but have not included the military. This thesis examines the need for and {{the costs and benefits}} of an employer-sponsored savings plan for active duty military personnel. It concludes that it is both feasible and cost-effective to tailor tax-sheltered annuities (TSA's) currently available to nonprofit organizations to the military compensation system. It proposes an account for saving <b>active</b> <b>pay</b> (ASAP) that would permit contributions of one percent (%) of base pay (up to the 20 percent which TSAs allow) per year of military service with the account maturing upon termination of active duty. This program, as envisioned for active duty military personnel, would provide an incentive to improve personal financial management practices. This, in turn, would encourage military personnel to contribute to improvement of the national savings rate. Lieutenant Commander, United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{provides}} {{evidence that}} social networks strongly affect board composition and are detrimental to corporate governance. Our empirical investigation {{relies on a}} large data set of executives and outside directors of French public firms. This data source is a matched employer-employee data set that provides detailed information on directors/CEOs {{as well as information}} about the firm employing them. We find a strong and robust correlation between the CEO's network and that of his directors. Networks of former high-ranking civil servants are the most active in shaping board composition. Our identification strategy takes into account not only firm and directors' fixed effects but also the matching of firms and director in terms of one observable and one unobservable characteristic. Turning to the direct effects of such network activity, we find that firms in which these networks are most <b>active</b> <b>pay</b> their CEOs more, are less likely to replace a CEO who underperforms, and engage in less value-creating acquisitions. These findings suggest that social networks are active in the boardroom and have detrimental effects on firms' governance...|$|E
