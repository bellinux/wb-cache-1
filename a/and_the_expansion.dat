5|$|Bismuth {{is used to}} make {{free-machining}} steels and free-machining {{aluminium alloys}} for precision machining properties. It has similar effect to lead and improves the chip breaking during machining. The shrinking on solidification in lead <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> of bismuth compensate each other and therefore lead and bismuth are often used in similar quantities. Similarly, alloys containing comparable parts of bismuth and lead exhibit a very small change (on the order 0.01%) upon melting, solidification or aging. Such alloys are used in high-precision casting, e.g. in dentistry, to create models and molds. Bismuth is also used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons and as a thermocouple material.|$|E
5|$|Despite the pursued aim of pan-Germanic unification, {{the primary}} goal of the German Reich’s {{territorial}} expansionism was to acquire sufficient Lebensraum (living space) in Eastern Europe for the Germanic übermenschen or superior men.

This was to be accomplished through the enlargement of the territorial base of the German state <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> of the German population, and the wholesale extermination of the indigenous Slavic inhabitants and the Germanisation of Baltic inhabitants.|$|E
