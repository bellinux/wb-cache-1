40|$|TWinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP) steels {{are single}} phase {{austenitic}} alloys that successfully combine {{the properties of}} high strength and ductility. Thus, TWIP steels are an ideal candidate material for applications where the absorption of energy is required, such as armour or automotive crash safety systems. The TWIP effect arises due {{to the formation of}} thin lenticular deformation twins during straining. These twins act as strong barriers to dislocation movement. This results in a dynamic grain refinement process, leading to an increasing work hardening capacity and superior ductility. This thesis presents work carried out to develop our understanding of the mechanical properties and the micromechanics of twinning in a TWIP steel during deformation. In-situ X-ray synchrotron diffraction loading experiments were conducted to investigate the evolution of deformation texture, lattice strain and peak width during deformation at quasi- static strain rates. The lattice strain evolution indicated that twinning occurs very early during deformation and remarkably initiates before the macroscopic yield point. In addition, the in-situ experimental observations were modelled successfully using an elasto-plastic self consistent (EPSC) model. The armour capabilities of the material was investigated using Hopkinson pressure bar and blast testing. The characteristics of twinning were found to be dependent on the strain rate. Fewer active twin systems were observed at high strain rates (i. e. > 1000 s- 1) while the twins were relatively thicker compared to those observed at lower strain rates.

40|$|Considerable {{effort has}} been devoted {{over the last decade}} to the {{development}} of iron aluminides as materials for high temperature applications, where their good oxidation and corrosion resistance, combined with reasonable strength, may be utilized. Poor formability and ductility, however, particularly at room temperature, has hampered the exploitation of these materials. The present review examines the present state of understanding of the factors which influence the ductility. Recent search has made clear the important influence of testing environment, the role of Al content and minor additions of B, as well as the effect of quenched-in vacancies. The extent to which other factors, such as alloying additions and microstructural features, affect the ductility has not received the same attention, and is examined in the present study. <b>Alloy</b> <b>strengthening,</b> by almost any mechanism, is seen to lead to a dramatic loss of ductility. The only parameter allowing both strength increase and ductility improvement for a given set of Al/B/ vacancy/environment conditions is the grain size. The best ductility for a given alloy, which should have as low an Al content as compatible with other requirements, is obtained by refining the grain size and by maintaining the alloy in the softest possible state. For the most part these conclusions are drawn from analysis of the behavior of B 2 ordered FeAl alloys, although similar trends seem also to apply to alloys of slightly lower Al content where DO 3 ordering can occur. The observations drawn can be understood in terms of the mechanisms leading to the nucleation and propagation of brittle fracture, either as transgranular cleavage cracks or as grain boundary cracks. The possible role of additional factors, such as the texture, or grain and grain boundary distribution, surface layers producing protective stress effects, and strain homogenizing or crack arresting dispersions, has not been sufficiently evaluated to determine whether any further improvements of ductility are possible.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is about the}} effect of grain refinement on strength and formability of polycrystalline metals. The study has been performed by analytical and experimental approaches: In the analytical work, mechanical behavior of polycrystalline materials is modeled by assuming that grain interior behavior is controlled by crystal slip with strain hardening, anisotropy and size effect; and grain boundary behavior under stress described a behavior of grain boundary “Mantle Zone” is controlled by viscous response. For such composite response, FEM simulation was carried out to estimate the stress-strain response for different grain size materials down to nanocrystalline size. Predicted dependence of strength on grain size was in agreement with Hall-Petch relation. The simulation also predicted weakening of materials at very fine grain size when mantle zone viscosity is low or it approaches Newtonian viscous behavior. In the experimental work, study was conducted primarily on formability of alloys as a function of temperature and strain rate. This was done with alloys which were first prepared in ultra-fine grained condition. The work was performed on Mg alloy, Ti alloy and TRIP steel, representing material systems from hcp to bcc-fcc transformation toughened structures. In all cases, formability was found to be enhanced as a function of temperature, causing significant increase in fracture strain. Grain boundary sliding accommodated by boundary diffusion and possible core diffusion were suggested to be the rate-controlling mechanism for superlastic deformation, while, for TRIP steel at the temperature range (25 - 400 oC), thermal activation of plastic flow was found to be most important. For magnesium alloy, the mechanism of grain refinement was studied in relation to subdivision of coarse grains by twinning process; slip in the inter-twin volume with twin plane rotation. For titanium alloy, enhanced superplasticity at low temperature was examined in the submicrocrystalline range.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{details the}} findings of experimental investigations of welds made between ferritic creep resistant steels that differ in chromium content. Analysis of the microstructural evolution during the application of post weld heat treatments is reported. Particular {{attention was paid to}} the key <b>alloy</b> <b>strengthening</b> mechanisms {{and the manner in which}} they were affected by carbon redistribution which takes place when these welds are exposed to high temperatures. The fusion interface regions of transition joints, made between P 91 parent alloy and P 22, P 23 and P 24 type weld consumables, were analysed in as received and post weld heat treated conditions. Carbon redistribution from the low to higher alloyed material, which resulted in its depletion from weld alloy adjacent to the fusion line, was confirmed in all weld systems subsequent to post weld heat treatment (PWHT). The effect of tempering treatments, carried out at 730 °C for two and eight hour durations, on carbide populations in partially decarburised weld alloy was explored. The consequential microstructural changes, which were affected by the dissolution of M 23 C 6 and M 7 C 3 carbides, were compared to those observed in regions of weld alloy unaffected by carbon depletion. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) were used extensively in the analysis of weld metal and heat affected zone (HAZ) microstructures. Electron diffraction and x-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy were exploited in the crystallographic and chemical characterisation of precipitates. Their evolution as a function of thermal exposure is presented for each alloy. Chemical signatures for each precipitate species, which enabled their identification, were determined for carbides in the different alloys. However, due to variations in the compositions of fusion interface M 23 C 6 carbides, some permutations of which overlapped with compositions of M 7 C 3, satisfactory identification demanded classification of their crystal structure. A significant difference between the microstructures of P 23 and P 24 alloys, in the weld specimens tested, was observed. Although vanadium and niobium carbonitrides (MX) were identified in both alloys, their distributions were not the same. Retention of carbonitride particles within partially decarburised P 23 and P 24 weld materials, subsequent to 8 hours post weld heat treatment, has been substantiated. Diffraction intensity distributions in Debye-Scherrer ring patterns, which were generated from MX precipitation, indicated lattice parameters varied. Microanalysis revealed that MX precipitates were present over a wide range of compositions. A combination of the composition analysis and diffraction studies indicated that MX precipitation was stable over a range of compositions in the carbon depleted regions of P 24 alloy. Recrystallisation of the bainitic P 22 weld alloy adjacent to the fusion line, which was accompanied by a loss of material hardness, was observed in 2 and 8 hour PWHT P 91 /P 22 welds. It has been shown that the microstructural stabilisation of carbon depleted T/P 23 and T/P 24 alloys was conferred by a dispersion of MX precipitates. Retention of these stable particles, which in many cases are less than 10 nm in diameter, in carbon depleted material, resulted in the complete avoidance of any recrystallisation in 2 hour post weld heat treated T/P 23 and T/P 24 welds and only isolated occurrences in 8 hour tempered specimens. Subgrain size distributions were determined from electron channeling contrast images of various regions of the dissimilar metal welds. Results showed that, although recrystallisation of MX forming alloys did not occur, destabilisation of lath boundaries, due to the dissolution of M 23 C 6 and M 7 C 3 carbides, results in a coarser subgrain microstructure in carbon depleted P 24 weld alloy. The loss of resistance to plastic deformation as a result of recrystallisation, which has been shown to take place in decarburised P 22 alloy, was not observed in the alloys which precipitated the MX phase...|$|E

Die-cast AZ 91 {{is one of the}} most widely used alloys. It exhibits excellent die castability, good strength properties and a fair ductility but its mechanical properties, especially the creep resistance, decrease on exposure at temperature above 120 ºC [1]. Softening and coarsening of the interdendritic phase β-Al 12 Mg 17 in AZ 91 can readily occur at elevated temperatures due to its low melting temperature (Tm = 437 °C) [2]. Rare earth in magnesium alloys usually brings about <b>alloy</b> <b>strengthening</b> through the formation of thermally stable intergranular phases and the complete suppression of the β-Al 12 Mg 17 phase formation. In the present work tensile creep behavior of the die-cast magnesium alloys AZ 91 and AE 42 and their microstructural change during plastic deformation in creep have been studied. The objective of the work is to study the active creep mechanisms on the basis of the creep data in combination with the microstructural investigations. The SEM micrographs in Fig. 1 (a-b) illustrate the as-cast microstructures of the two die cast alloys showing a typical dendritic solidification structure with a fine-scale grain size. Segregation of Al adjacent to the dendrite boundaries can be seen clearly in AZ 91 D. Phases with a bright contrast and surrounded by high Al-segregated eutectic α-Mg are β-Al 12 Mg 17 phase. Segregation of Al seems not obvious in AE 42. The dominant interdendritic phase is Al 11 RE 3. Mn-containing phases also formed during solidification in both AZ 91 and AE 42. The TEM micrographs in Fig. 2 (a-c) illustrate the structural changes during creep in AZ 91 and AE 42. Fig. 2 (a) shows the formation of denuded zones around the dendrite boundaries and the formation of discontinuous precipitates Al 12 Mg 17. TEM/XEDS revealed that the Al content in the denuded zones decreased after creep test, from the original 5. 5 % to 2. 5 % (wt%). Fig. 2 (b-c) illustrates the formation of dislocation sources in the (0001) basal planes under a relatively high stress and the movement of dislocations from the sources towards the dendrite boundaries. The existence of the supersaturated Al-segregated zones adjacent to the dendrite boundaries is the main reason for the recovery of AZ 91 at operating temperatures above 100 ºC. Under loading plastic deformation occurred by the diffusion of Al atoms along the boundaries from compressive to tensile grain boundaries that caused the formation of the denuded grain boundaries and as a consequence the formation of the discontinuous precipitates Al 12 Mg 17. Dislocation climb process also operated and tended to become a dominant process at stress above 60 MPa. The low level of Al in AE 42 suppresses the formation of Al supersaturated zones adjacent to the dendrite boundaries that, combining with the formation of the thermally stable interdendritic phase Al 11 RE 3 (Tm~ 640 ºC), provides AE 42 a much better creep performance. Diffusion accompanying with the dislocation climb also occurred and became more dominant at a relatively high stress. Figure 1 SEM micrographs of the die cast alloys (a) AZ 91 D; (b) AE 42.

It is shown that PFZ formation in the 8090 MMC causes a drastic reduction in the proof strength (about 100 MPa), but it has little influence on the time required for peak ageing. In all <b>alloys</b> <b>strengthening</b> due to GPB zones is more important than strengthening due to delta' (Al 3 Li) phase...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this work is to examine if the {{behavior}} of refractory alloys in oxidation at high temperature can {{be influenced by the}} modification of the interdendritic carbides morphology due to a preliminary aging treatment at high temperature. A cobalt-based <b>alloy</b> <b>strengthened</b> by tantalum carbides was first exposed to 1200 °C over a period of 100 hours, and characterized in high temperature oxidation, with samples cut {{in the middle of the}} alloy. Thermogravimetry runs were performed in air at 1000, 1100 and 1200 °C during 50 hours, and the results were analyzed in order to specify the rates of transient oxidation, of parabolic oxidation and of chromia volatilization. The oxidized samples were metallographically examined. The fragmentation of the TaC carbides induced by the aging treatment tends to accelerate the oxidation kinetics in general, with higher values of parabolic and volatilization constants especially at 1200 °C...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{fabricate}} dispersion <b>strengthened</b> <b>alloys</b> <b>strengthened</b> by submicron-sized or nano-sized stable particles through casting routes, {{understanding of the}} formation process of dispersion strengthening particles in metal melt is of significance. Thus, nano NiO and TiO 2 particles were selected as reactant to form in-situ dispersion strengthening oxide particles in Fe 20 Cr 5 Al alloy. Nano NiO and TiO 2 particle powder was separately dispersed into nano Ni powder first. The loose mixed nano powder was added in Fe 20 Cr 5 Al alloy melt when pouring the melt into mold. The study shows that nano NiO particles were not as effective as nano TiO 2 particles in forming dispersion strengthening Al 2 O 3 particles. The final diameters of dispersion strengthening oxide particles arose from nano TiO 2 particles were of submicron. The Brownian collision of particles had caused this coarsening...|$|R
40|$|Hardness and {{strength}} values of over 55 copper <b>alloys</b> <b>strengthened</b> by solid solution strengthening, precipitation hardening, cold working, and dispersion strengthening were compiled. The yield strength (YS) and {{ultimate tensile strength}} (UTS) values of the copper alloys examined ranged between 50 to 1300 [*]MPa and 200 to 1400 [*]MPa, respectively. The compiled values were classified based on strain-hardening potential an indirect method to understand the effect of strain-hardening characteristics. Least squares regression analysis was employed to establish correlations between strength and Vickers hardness values. Strain-hardening potential showed {{a significant effect on}} the correlations. In all the cases, a linear relation was obtained for both YS and UTS with hardness for the entire range of values under analysis. Simple empirical equations were proposed to estimate the strength using bulk hardness. The proposed correlations obtained for the entire range of values were verified with experimental values. A good agreement was observed between experimental and predicted values...|$|R
40|$|The {{techniques}} of electron microscopy {{were used to}} examine the microstructural changes which occur during primary creep for two important types of engineering alloys: (1) <b>alloys</b> <b>strengthened</b> by solid-solution additions, and (2) dispersion-strengthened alloys. The metals chosen for study are unalloyed titanium, Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, and the cobalt-base alloy, Haynes 188. Results to date on NGR 47 - 004 - 108 show that development of prior dislocation substructure in Haynes 188 by 10 % prestrain and annealing for one hour at 1800 F increases the time to reach 0. 5 % creep strain at 1600 F by more than an order of magnitude for creep stresses from 3 to 20 ksi. For creep at 1800 F, similar results were obtaind for stresses above 7 ksi, but the prior substructure decreases creep resistance below 7 ksi. This effect appears to be related to instability of grain structure at 1800 F in prestrained material...|$|R
