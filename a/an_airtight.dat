5|$|Meibomian glands, in the eyelids, secrete {{a form of}} sebum called meibum {{onto the}} eye, that slows the {{evaporation}} of tears. It also serves to create <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> seal when the eyes are closed and its lipid quality also prevents the eyelids from sticking together. The meibomian glands are also known as tarsal glands, Zeis glands and palpebral glands. They attach directly to the follicles of the eyelashes, which are arranged vertically within the tarsal plates of the eyelids.|$|E
5|$|Chris Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency {{astronaut}} and STS-74 mission specialist, {{used the}} shuttle's robot arm to hoist the docking module {{out of the}} aft portion of the payload bay, rotated it to a vertical position, and moved it to within five inches of the Orbiter Docking System. At that point, the shuttle fired its downward steering jets and moved the shuttle toward the docking module. Once the two spacecraft were locked together, the docking ring on the Orbiter Docking System retracted, {{and a series of}} hooks and latches were engaged to ensure <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> seal between the two spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|When collected, {{the skin}} of the cap is left intact, and dirt is brushed off the surface. Pores are left unless old and soft. Boletus aereus is {{especially}} suited for drying, a process which enhances its flavour and aroma. Like other boletes, the mushrooms can be dried by being sliced and strung separately on twine, then hung close to the ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with a brush (washing is not recommended), and then placed in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer on top of a boiler or hot water tank. Once dry, they are kept in <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> jar. They are easily reconstituted by soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water is infused with the mushroom aroma and can be used as stock in subsequent cooking. When dried, a small amount of the mushroom can improve the taste of less flavoursome fungi-based dishes.|$|E
5|$|After another full {{examination}} in 1911, with {{comparisons to}} the Ashmolean head, archaeologists dismissed the Ashmolean head as a fake. The absence of firm {{evidence of the}} whereabouts of Cromwell's head between 1684 and 1787 made them wary about declaring the head genuine. They concluded their study unable to verify or refute the head's identity. The uncertainty increased public demand for a full scientific examination, and Wilkinson reluctantly allowed the head to be taken for examination by the eugenicist Karl Pearson and the anthropologist Geoffrey Morant. Their 109-page report {{concluded that there was}} a “moral certainty” that the Wilkinson head was that of Oliver Cromwell. Horace Wilkinson died in 1957, bequeathing the head to his son, also called Horace. Horace Wilkinson wished to organise a proper burial for the head rather than a public display, so he contacted Sidney Sussex College, which welcomed the burial. There it was interred on 25 March 1960, in a secret location near the antechapel, preserved in the oak box in which the Wilkinson family had kept the head since 1815. The box was placed into <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> container and buried with only a few witnesses, including family and representatives of the college. The secret burial was not announced until October 1962.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouthpiece}} {{and reed}} {{are surrounded by}} the player's lips, which put light, even pressure on the reed and form <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> seal. Air is blown past the reed and down the instrument. In {{the same way a}} flag flaps in the breeze, the air rushing past the reed causes it to vibrate. As air pressure from the mouth increases, the amount the reed vibrates increases until the reed hits the mouthpiece. At this point the reed stays pressed against the mouthpiece until either the springiness of the reed forces it to open or a returning pressure wave 'bumps' into the reed and opens it. Each time the reed opens, a puff of air goes through the gap, after which the reed swings shut again. When played loudly, the reed can spend up to 50% of the time shut. The 'puff of air' or compression wave (around 3% greater pressure than the surrounding air) travels down the cylindrical tube and escapes {{at the point where the}} tube opens out. This is either at the closest open hole or at the end of the tube (see diagram: image 1).|$|E

5|$|Another {{close friend}} of SpongeBob is Sandy Cheeks, a {{squirrel}} from Texas. She is a scientist and an expert in karate. She lives in an oak tree entrapped in a clear glass dome locked by <b>an</b> <b>airtight,</b> hand-turned seal. When outside of her dwelling, she wears an astronaut-like suit because she cannot breathe underwater. Mr. Krabs, a miserly crab obsessed with money, {{is the owner of}} the Krusty Krab restaurant and SpongeBob's boss. Krabs has a teenage whale daughter named Pearl, whom he values equally with his riches. His rival, Plankton, is a small green copepod who owns a low-rank fast-food restaurant called the Chum Bucket, located {{across the street from the}} Krusty Krab. Plankton spends most of his time planning to steal the secret recipe for Mr. Krabs's popular Krabby Patty burgers, so as to gain the upper hand and put the Krusty Krab out of business. The majority of Plankton's plans come from his intelligent yet sarcastic computer wife Karen, who is more competent and less conceited than him. When SpongeBob is not working at the Krusty Krab, he can often be found at Mrs. Puff's boating school (the underwater equivalent of a driver's education course). SpongeBob is perpetually unable to pass Mrs. Puff's exams, which is why he almost always walks around town.|$|E
25|$|Leftover {{decorated}} pavlova can be refrigerated overnight, but {{the dessert}} will absorb moisture and lose its crispness. Undecorated pavlova {{can be left}} overnight in the oven, or for several days in <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> container, to be decorated when ready.|$|E
25|$|Most {{microorganisms}} {{found in}} cannabis only affect plants and not humans, but some microorganisms, {{especially those that}} proliferate when the herb is not correctly dried and stored, can be harmful to humans.

50|$|A peat house provides, {{similar to}} the igloo, a compact form with less surface and hence less {{exposure}} to the wind. It also shows <b>a</b> nearly <b>airtight</b> shell with good heat insulation (peat). An optimised orientation to the sun adds additional degrees during the day.|$|R
50|$|In 1969, {{upon their}} {{return from the}} Moon, the crewmen of Apollo 11 were quarantined in the Mobile Quarantine Facility, <b>a</b> {{modified}} <b>airtight</b> Airstream trailer, until it could be determined {{that there was little}} likelihood of their having brought back lunar pathogens with them.|$|R
25|$|Between 1914 and 1954 an {{electric}} tug {{was used to}} pull boats through the tunnel. In 1954 a large fan was constructed at the south portal. While all the boats are within the tunnel <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> door is shut and all the air is pulled through the tunnel by the fan. This allows diesel boats to use the tunnel without suffocating the boaters. Today the journey takes about 30–40 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The {{containment}} building itself is typically <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> steel structure enclosing the reactor normally sealed {{off from the}} outside atmosphere. The steel is either free-standing or attached to the concrete missile shield. In the United States, the design and thickness of the containment and the missile shield are governed by federal regulations (10 CFR 50.55a), and must {{be strong enough to}} withstand the impact of a fully loaded passenger airliner without rupture.|$|E
25|$|Using {{differential}} scanning calorimetry {{to study}} the stability to oxidation of samples generally requires <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> sample chamber. Usually, such tests are done isothermally (at constant temperature) by changing {{the atmosphere of the}} sample. First, the sample is brought to the desired test temperature under an inert atmosphere, usually nitrogen. Then, oxygen is added to the system. Any oxidation that occurs is observed as a deviation in the baseline. Such analysis can be used to determine the stability and optimum storage conditions for a material or compound.|$|E

50|$|A tubed tire has a {{separate}} inner tube, made of butyl rubber or latex, that provides <b>a</b> relatively <b>airtight</b> barrier inside the tire. A {{vast majority of}} the tire systems in use are clinchers, due to the relative simplicity of repairs and wide availability of replacement inner tubes.|$|R
50|$|Extended {{operation}} is possible if the pots {{are able to}} draw water from a storage container, such as <b>an</b> inverted <b>airtight</b> jar, or if the pots are placed in a shallow pool of water.

25|$|Pyrophoric flares {{work on the}} {{principle}} of ejecting a special pyrophoric material out of <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> cartridge, usually using a gas generator, e.g. a small pyrotechnic charge or pressurized gas. The material then self-ignites in contact with air. The materials can be solid, e.g. iron platelets coated with ultrafine aluminium, or liquid, often organometallic compounds; e.g. alkyl aluminium compounds, e.g. triethylaluminium. Pyrophoric flares may have reduced effectiveness at high altitudes, due to lower air temperature and lower availability of oxygen; however oxygen can be co-ejected with the pyrophoric fuel.|$|E
25|$|A {{vacuum tube}} {{consists}} {{of two or more}} electrodes in a vacuum inside <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> enclosure. Most tubes have glass envelopes with a glass-to-metal seal based on kovar sealable borosilicate glasses, though ceramic and metal envelopes (atop insulating bases) have been used. The electrodes are attached to leads which pass through the envelope via <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> seal. Most vacuum tubes have a limited lifetime, due to the filament or heater burning out or other failure modes, so they are made as replaceable units; the electrode leads connect to pins on the tube's base which plug into a tube socket. Tubes were a frequent cause of failure in electronic equipment, and consumers were expected to be able to replace tubes themselves. In addition to the base terminals, some tubes had an electrode terminating at a top cap. The principal reason for doing this was to avoid leakage resistance through the tube base, particularly for the high impedance grid input. The bases were commonly made with phenolic insulation which performs poorly as an insulator in humid conditions. Other reasons for using a top cap include improving stability by reducing grid-to-anode capacitance, improved high-frequency performance, keeping a very high plate voltage away from lower voltages, and accommodating one more electrode than allowed by the base. There was even an occasional design that had two top cap connections.|$|E
25|$|Mick died on 6 May 1939, a {{few weeks}} short of his thirteenth birthday, having amassed around £20,000 in stud fees, from {{appearances}} in films, and in prize money. After his death he was stuffed and given by his last owner, A.H. Kempton, to the Natural History Museum in London; he has since been moved to the Natural History Museum at Tring in Hertfordshire where he is still on public view. He stands in cabinet 58 of the household dogs section at the museum in <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> case filled with an insecticide called Vapona {{in order to prevent}} any damage by insects.|$|E
50|$|A smoke hood is a {{protective}} device similar in concept to a gas mask. <b>A</b> translucent <b>airtight</b> bag seals around {{the head of}} the wearer while an air filter held in the mouth connects to the outside atmosphere and is used to breathe.

50|$|Kurnaz {{was also}} put in solitary {{confinement}} in a windowless refrigerator and subjected to hypothermia. He was caged in a container in the Cuban sun baking in extreme heat, and in <b>a</b> small <b>airtight</b> box so that over hours and days he suffocated slowly. He was starved or force-fed; subjected to sexual humiliation; and beaten constantly.|$|R
50|$|The ship {{will have}} balloons, sails, and pedal-driven steering. A {{good part of}} the book deals with the tribulations of Purple in trying to create this work, beyond the {{technology}} of the local people. He creates 'aircloth' (<b>a</b> thin, <b>airtight</b> cloth), <b>a</b> rubber-equivalent, and splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. He is successful in building the ship.|$|R
25|$|Kapton tape {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used tapes and methods for TC and TC {{conductor}} attachment. When several layers are applied, each layer has an additive effect on the insulation and may negatively impact a profile. A disadvantage of this tape is that the PCB has to be very clean and smooth to achieve <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> cover over the thermocouple weld and conductors. Another disadvantage to Kapton tape is that at temperatures above 200°C the tape becomes elastic and, hence, the TCs have a tendency to lift off the substrate surface. The result is erroneous readings characterized by jagged lines in the profile.|$|E
25|$|Coffee is best {{stored in}} <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> {{container}} made of ceramic, glass, or non-reactive metal. Higher quality prepackaged coffee usually has a one-way valve which prevents air from entering while allowing the coffee to release gases. Coffee freshness and flavor is preserved {{when it is}} stored away from moisture, heat, and light. The ability of coffee to absorb strong smells from food means {{that it should be}} kept away from such smells. Storage of coffee in the refrigerator is not recommended due to the presence of moisture which can cause deterioration. Exterior walls of buildings which face the sun may heat the interior of a home, and this heat may damage coffee stored near such a wall. Heat from nearby ovens also harms stored coffee.|$|E
25|$|The {{storage of}} pasta {{depends on how}} far along it is processed. Uncooked pasta is kept dry and can sit in the {{cupboard}} for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is stored {{in the refrigerator for}} a maximum of five days in <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> container. Adding a couple teaspoons of oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. If the cooked pasta is not used in the five days it may be frozen for up to two or three months. The pasta will start to dry after a period of time, but it varies with the type of pasta. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.|$|E
5000|$|A pack or {{packet of}} {{cigarettes}} is a rectangular container, mostly of paperboard, which contains cigarettes. The pack is designed with a flavor-protective foil, paper or biodegradable plastic, and sealed through <b>a</b> transparent <b>airtight</b> plastic film. By pulling the [...] "pull-tabs", the pack is opened. Hard packs can be closed again after opening, whereas soft packs cannot.|$|R
50|$|Each deck {{is housed}} in a {{circular}} disk and divided into sections, each numbered. The amount of sections depends {{on the size of}} the ship.
