Measurements of pressure at the inlet and outlet of both stages and in the inter-stage pipe hinted at an acoustic excitation in the annular space between impeller and <b>adjustable</b> <b>nozzle</b> ring.

40|$|Expansion work {{recovery}} by two-phase ejector {{is known to}} be beneficial to vapor compression cycle performance. However, {{one of the biggest challenges}} with ejector vapor compression cycle is that the ejector cycle performance is sensitive to working condition changes which are common in real world applications. Different working conditions require different ejector geometries to achieve maximum performance. Slightly different geometries may result in substantially different COPs under the same conditions. Ejector motive nozzle throat diameter (motive nozzle restrictiveness) is one of the key parameters that can significantly affect COP. This paper presents a new motive nozzle restrictiveness control mechanism for two-phase ejectors used in vapor compression cycles, which has the advantages of being simple, potentially less costly and less vulnerable to clogging. The new control mechanism can possibly avoid the additional frictional losses of previously proposed ejector control mechanisms using adjustable needle. The redesigned ejector utilizes an adjustable vortex at the motive inlet to control the nozzle restrictiveness on the flow expanded in the motive nozzle. An <b>adjustable</b> <b>nozzle</b> based on this new control mechanism was designed and manufactured for experiments with R 134 a. The experimental results showed that, without changing the nozzle geometry, the nozzle restrictiveness on the two-phase flow can be adjusted over a wide range.

This feature could be very useful for the future application of ejector in mobile or stationary systems under changing working conditions...|$|E

Arrays of impinging jets are used in industry for heat and mass transfer processes. A new type of jet was recently developed which could be utilized in such arrays. This jet is the radial jet and it offers the advantages of variable net force on an impingement surface with high surface heat and mass transfer.

Hence a system level model which incorporates thermodynamics, electricity as well as mechanics at the same time taking cost into consideration is being developed to obtain the optimum design. This paper explores four different cooling mechanisms and discusses their transient performance. The mechanisms are categorized based on chilled water, ice water mixture, phase change material and vapor compression cycle (VCC). Preliminary calculations have revealed the water based model to have a bulk manufacturing cost of $ 96 on the lower while the VCC model to have $ 130 on the higher side. Weights of the cooling mechanism vary from 4 kg for the ice water model to 25 kg for the chilled water model. The coefficients of performance vary between 1. 4 for the chilled water to 2. 7 for the VCC model. System parameters to operate each mechanism for a sample two hour cooling operation are obtained from the model.

Micro Hydro is a term used for hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to 20 kW of power in Sri Lankan context. Many Micro-hydro power plants are operated with Pelton turbines. The main reasons for using Pelton turbines are that they are very simple and relatively cheap. As the stream flow varies, water flow to the turbine can be easily controlled by changing the number of nozzles or by using <b>adjustable</b> <b>nozzles.</b> Since most of the micro hydro Pelton turbines are now manufactured locally, it was revealed that much attention is not paid to the surface finish of the turbine buckets. On the other hand due to sand erosion of turbine parts bucket surface are getting rough day by day. Most of the research that had been done on turbines were focused on improving the performance with particular reference to turbine components such as shaft seals, speed increasers and bearings. There is not much information available on effects of blade/bucket friction on the performance of Pelton turbine. The main objective of this research is to analyze the performance of Micro hydro Pelton turbine particularly with respect to their blade friction. The governing laws of fluid dynamics, relevant to the application were used to develop a theoretical model to estimate the effect of blade friction on Pelton turbine performance. Then the developed mathematical model was validated experimentally. All the experiments are carried out in a Pelton turbine standard test bench. The power developed by the turbine was measured by keeping all the relevant parameters that affect to the power development, constant other than the friction of the bucket. The friction of the buckets was varied by varying surface roughness of the buckets. Different roughnesses of the surface was obtained by pasting various grades of sands one at a time {{on the surface of the}} buckets. It was concluded from the developed mathematical model and the experimental testing that power developed by a Pelton turbine increases when the surface roughness of the turbine bucket decreases. It was also proved from the research that splitter thickness of the buckets is also affect the power developed by the turbine. When the thickness of the splitter increases power developed by the turbine decreases. Therefore it is recommended from the study that Pelton turbine buckets must be smooth as much as possible and splitter of the buckets should be as sharp as much as possible to generate more power from a power plant...|$|R

A major market for the Griffin engine was in electricity generation, where they developed a reputation for happily running light for long periods, then suddenly being able to take up a large demand for power. Their large heavy construction didn't suit them to mobile use, but they were capable of burning heavier and cheaper grades of oil. The key principle of the [...] "Griffin Simplex" [...] was a heated exhaust-jacketed external vapouriser, into which the fuel was sprayed. The temperature was held around 550 F, sufficient to physically vapourise the oil but not to break it down chemically. This fractional distillation supported the use of heavy oil fuels, the unusable tars and asphalts separating out in the vapouriser.Hot-bulb ignition was used, which Griffin termed the [...] "catathermic igniter", a small isolated cavity connected to the combustion chamber.

To estimate a three-stream engine application {{as a part of}} the power-plant (PP) efficiency, was chosen an adaptive LPC technology scheme with the third contour air bypass beyond the critical section of a basic jet nozzle for which a mathematical model (MM) of the PP has been created on the basis of one-dimensional MM of the engine. The MM of the PP included 3 D modeling results of the air inlet, the LPC with various air extractions to the third contour, and the jet nozzle taking into account the interaction between the basic stream and the third contour stream. The predicted performance of an air inlet have been used to estimate the changes in a total pressure restoration coefficient and an additional resistance coefficient along «a fluid contour» when air extraction is included in the third contour in several cruiser modes of flight. An integrated characteristic of the LPC has been received at various points and levels of air extraction to the third contour, and parameters of extracted air (depending on the point and amount of air extraction, and also on the fan operating mode) have been calculated. When analyzing the obtained calculation results, the effect of pressure lines displacement to the right (towards the large reduced rates), growth of efficiency values, and also position displacement of its maximum value to the left (towards the descent reduced rates) has been found.
