5|$|Two-level utilitarianism is {{virtually}} {{a synthesis of}} the opposing doctrines of act utilitarianism <b>and</b> <b>rule</b> utilitarianism. Act utilitarianism states that in all cases the morally right action is the one which produces the most pleasure, whereas rule utilitarianism states that the morally right action {{is the one that}} is in accordance with a moral rule whose general observance would create the most happiness. In terms of two-level utilitarianism, act utilitarianism can be likened to the 'critical' level of moral thinking, <b>and</b> <b>rule</b> utilitarianism to the 'intuitive' level.|$|E

5|$|After the Congress of Vienna, a small Kingdom of Poland, {{known as}} Congress Poland, was recreated, with its king being the Tsar of Russia, Alexander I.

Finn and Jake are spotted by Marceline, who gives chase. After narrowly avoiding their demonic friend, the duo run into the now-benign Hunson Abadeer, who explains that he only wanted Marceline to follow in his footsteps <b>and</b> <b>rule</b> the hellish realm.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Beonna's life or his reign, as nothing in written form has survived from this period of East Anglian history. The very few primary sources for Beonna consist of bare {{references}} to his accession or rule written by late chroniclers, that until quite recently were impossible to verify. Since 1980, {{a sufficient number of}} coins have been found to show that he was indeed a historical figure. They have allowed scholars to make deductions about economic and linguistic links that existed between East Anglia and other parts of both England and northern Europe during his reign, as well as aspects of his own identity <b>and</b> <b>rule.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Constitution {{developed}} by the National Congress was implemented in July 1831. It guaranteed individual liberty, property rights, freedom of religion and the press, and equality before the law. Because of its perceived balance between freedom <b>and</b> <b>rule</b> of law, it was praised by liberals {{around the world and}} promoted as a model for future constitutions. Under the new constitution, Belgium had two chambers, a Chamber of Representatives and Senate, both elected by a small number of wealthy citizens. The King was allowed substantial power in military affairs, but was given little independent power in any other sphere, which was instead given to the elected chambers.|$|E
5|$|The two {{predecessor}} {{theories to}} two-level utilitarianism, act <b>and</b> <b>rule</b> utilitarianism, were beset by various objections. For example, rule utilitarianism {{was criticized for}} implying {{that in some cases}} an individual should pursue a course of action that would obviously not maximise utility. Conversely, act utilitarianism was criticized for not allowing for a 'human element' in its calculations, i.e. it is sometimes too difficult (or impossible) for an ordinary person.|$|E
5|$|This superficially {{impressive}} list {{of units}} overstates the actual {{capability of the}} armed forces at the time. Apart from privileged formations such as the Presidential Division and the 31st Airborne Brigade, most units were poorly trained, divided and so badly paid that they regularly resorted to looting. What operational abilities the armed forces had were gradually destroyed by politicisation of the forces, tribalisation, and division of the forces, included purges of suspectedly disloyal groups, intended to allow Mobutu to divide <b>and</b> <b>rule.</b> All this occurred against the background of increasing deterioration of state structures under the kleptocratic Mobutu regime.|$|E

In the mid 13th century, the Song government led by Jia Sidao began confiscating portions of estates owned by the rich {{in order to raise}} revenues in a land nationalization scheme.

Article 160 unites Malays from different ethnic groups as the prevailing race and thus embraces them with the political prowess to dominate <b>and</b> <b>rule</b> over other races: Chinese, Indians, Kadazan, Iban, Orang Asli etc. This is also apparent from the name of UMNO (United Malays National Organisation), who are a staunch political proponent of this role.|$|E

5|$|Constantine was a {{ruler of}} major importance, {{and he has}} always been a {{controversial}} figure. The fluctuations in Constantine's reputation reflect the nature of the ancient sources for his reign. These are abundant and detailed, but have been strongly influenced by the official propaganda of the period, and are often one-sided. There are no surviving histories or biographies dealing with Constantine's life <b>and</b> <b>rule.</b> The nearest replacement is Eusebius's Vita Constantini, a work that is a mixture of eulogy and hagiography. Written between 335AD and circa 339AD, the Vita extols Constantine's moral and religious virtues. The Vita creates a contentiously positive image of Constantine, and modern historians have frequently challenged its reliability. The fullest secular life of Constantine is the anonymous Origo Constantini. A work of uncertain date, the Origo focuses on military and political events, to the neglect of cultural and religious matters.|$|E

Irving injects {{himself with a}} variant of the Las Plagas {{parasite}} and mutates into a huge octopus-like beast. Redfield and Alomar defeat him, and his dying words lead them to a nearby cave to learn more. The cave is the source of a flower used to create viruses previously used by Umbrella, as well as a new strain named Uroboros. Redfield and Alomar find evidence that Tricell, the company funding the BSAA, took over a former Umbrella Corporation underground laboratory and continued Umbrella's research. In the facility, they discover thousands of capsules holding human test subjects. Although Redfield finds that one of the capsules is Valentine's, it is empty. When they leave, they discover that Tricell CEO Excella Gionne has been plotting with Wesker to launch missiles with the Uroboros virus across the globe; it is eventually revealed that Wesker hopes to take a chosen few from the chaos of infection <b>and</b> <b>rule</b> them, creating a new breed of humanity. Redfield and Alomar pursue Gionne, but are stopped by Wesker and the hooded figure, who is revealed to be a mind-controlled Valentine. Gionne and Wesker escape to a Tricell oil tanker; Redfield and Alomar fight Valentine, subduing her and removing the mind-control device before she orders Redfield to follow Wesker.|$|E
