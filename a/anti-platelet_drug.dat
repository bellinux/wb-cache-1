40|$|Abstract Background Diabetes is {{associated}} with an increased risk of several malignancies. Both diabetic patients and patients with cancer have an increase in platelet reactivity and platelet activation has recently emerged as a potential mediator of cancer progression. Drug therapies, such as aspirin, that reduce platelet reactivity reduce both cardiovascular and cancer risk. Methods We performed a cross-sectional analysis to assess the association between history of cancer and current <b>anti-platelet</b> <b>drug</b> use in a primary care population of adults with diabetes enrolled in the Vermont Diabetes Information System. Results Self-reported characteristics, medical history, and a complete medication list were recorded on 1007 diabetic adults. Fifty percent of diabetic patients used an <b>anti-platelet</b> <b>drug.</b> In unadjusted analysis, no association was seen between <b>anti-platelet</b> <b>drug</b> use and cancer history (OR = 0. 93; P =. 70). Platelet inhibitor use was associated with a decreased patient-reported history of malignancy in a multivariate logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, comorbidity, and number of medications (OR = 0. 66; CI 0. 44 - 0. 99; P =. 045). Similar odds of association were seen in both males and females, and for aspirin and non-aspirin platelet inhibitor therapy. Conclusions Our data suggest an association between <b>anti-platelet</b> <b>drug</b> use and reduced cancer prevalence in patients with diabetes. Given the potentially large implications of our observations in the diabetic population, further studies are required to determine if this association is causal. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} an <b>anti-platelet</b> <b>drug</b> (clopidogrel) on the prevention of steroid-induced osteonecrosis (ON) in rabbits. Methods. Adult male Japanese white rabbits {{were divided into two}} groups and treated as follows: one group received daily clopidogrel mixed in normal saline (AP; n = 35), the other received only normal saline (NS; n = 30). One week after the administration, all rabbits were injected once intramuscularly with 20 mg/kg of methylprednisolone acetate into the right gluteus medius muscle. Three weeks after, both the femora and humeri were examined histopathologically for the presence of ON. The platelet aggrega-tion assay and hematological examinations were performed before and after the steroid injection. Results. The incidence of ON in the AP group (48. 5 %) was significantly lower than that observed in the NS group (73. 3 %). The platelet aggregations in the AP group were significantly inhibited by the adminis-tration of clopidogrel. The levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides showed {{no significant differences between the}} AP and NS group. Conclusion.

40|$|Anti-platelet therapy {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the treatment of patients with thrombotic diseases. The most commonly used <b>anti-platelet</b> <b>drugs,</b> namely, aspirin, ticlopidine, and clopidogrel, are effective in the prevention and treatment of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (e. g., abciximab, eptifibatide and tirofiban) have demonstrated good clinical benefits and safety profiles in decreasing ischemic events in acute coronary syndrome. However, adverse events related to thrombosis or bleeding have been reported in cases of therapy with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists. Cilostazol is an anti-platelet agent used in the treatment of patients with peripheral ischemia, such as intermittent claudication. Presently, platelet adenosine diphosphate P 2 Y(12) receptor antagonists (e. g., clopidogrel, prasugrel, cangrelor, and ticagrelor) are being used in clinical settings for their pronounced protective effects. The new protease-activated receptor antagonists, vorapaxar and atopaxar, potentially decrease the risk of ischemic events without significantly increasing the rate of bleeding. Some other new <b>anti-platelet</b> <b>drugs</b> undergoing clinical trials have also been introduced. Indeed, the number of new <b>anti-platelet</b> <b>drugs</b> is increasing.

CLZ group was given CLZ mixed feed from 2 weeks before carotid injury. Control group was fed normal diet. CLZ accelerated reendothelialization at 2 weeks after surgery and resulted in a significant reduction of neointima formation 4 weeks after surgery compared with that in control group.

The short-term ulcerogenic in vitro and in vivo anti-platelet properties, pharmacodynamic profiles, and extent of hepatic extraction of these phenolic esters were compared with aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). The more lipophilic esters (longer carbon chain length in O-acyl group) show significantly less gastrotoxicity in stressed rats than does aspirin after a single oral dose. The in vitro and in vivo anti-platelet studies show that these phenolic esters inhibited (1) arachidonate-triggered human platelet aggregation and (2) thrombin-stimulated rat serum thromboxane Ag production by platelets in the clotting process almost as effectively as aspirin. The hepatic extractions of these O-acyl derivatives are significantly higher than those of aspirin. The pharmacodynamic studies show that these O-acyl derivatives of salicylic acid and diflunisal probably bind to, or combine with, the same site on the platelet cyclooxygenase as aspirin. Replacing the O-acetyl group with longer chain O-acyl moiety in this series of phenolic esters markedly reduced the potential of these agents to induce short-term gastric injury but did not lessen their activity as inhibitors of platelet aggregation.
