40|$|Abstract—Low {{frequency}} power oscillations may {{be triggered}} by many events in the system. Most oscillations are damped by the system, but undamped oscillations can lead to system collapse. Oscillations develop {{as a result of}} rotor acceleration/deceleration following a change in active power transfer from <b>a</b> <b>generator.</b> <b>Like</b> the operations limits, the monitoring of power system oscillating modes is a relevant aspect of power system operation and control. Unprevented low-frequency power swings can be cause of cascading outages that can rapidly extend effect on wide region. On this regard, a Wide Area Monitoring, Protection and Control Systems (WAMPCS) help in detecting such phenomena and assess power system dynamics security. The monitoring of power system electromechanical oscillations is very important in the frame of modern power system management and control. In first part, this paper compares the different technique for identification of power system oscillations. Second part analyzes possible identification some power system dynamics behaviors Using Wide Area Monitoring Systems (WAMS) based on Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and wavelet technique.

40|$|Line drop compensation, {{high side}} voltage control, {{secondary}} voltage control — why not control <b>a</b> <b>generator</b> <b>like</b> a static var compensator? Abstract: Generators typically regulate terminal voltage via {{automatic voltage regulator}} and exciter equipment. The desired high side (transmission side) voltage schedule is usually maintained by the power plant operator or by slow SCADA-type process control computers. Power system dynamic performance, however, can be improved by faster regulation of the transmission voltage. Contrasted to generators, static var compensators are designed specifically for transmission voltage regulation. The transmission voltage is directly regulated at high speed. Total SVC and medium voltage component reactive power ratings are referred to the transmission side. All medium voltage equipment are designed to support the transmission side reactive power and voltage regulation requirements. The droop (slope) setting is usually small compared to generators regulating terminal voltage. This paper introduces the panel session on secondary voltage control. I outline various methods for tighter high side voltage control, with emphasis on control of hydro generation in the U. S. Pacific Northwest...|$|E
40|$|The {{vertices}} of {{a finite}} state system are usually {{a subset of}} the natural numbers. Most algorithms relative to these systems only use this fact to select vertices. For infinite state systems, however, the situation is different: in particular, for such systems having a finite description, each state of the system is a configuration of some machine. Then most algorithmic approaches rely on the structure of these configurations. Such characterisations are said internal. In order to apply algorithms detecting a structural property (like identifying connected components) one may have first to transform the system in order to fit the description needed for the algorithm. The problem of internal characterisation is that it hides structural properties, and each solution becomes ad hoc relatively to the form of the configurations. On the contrary, external characterisations avoid explicit naming of the vertices. Such character-isation are mostly defined via graph transformations. In this paper we present two kind of external characterisations: deterministic graph rewriting, which in turn characterise regular graphs, deterministic context-free languages, and rational graphs. Inverse substitution from <b>a</b> <b>generator</b> (<b>like</b> the complete binary tree) provides characterisation for prefix-recognizable graphs, the Caucal Hierarchy and rational graphs. We illustrate how these char-acterisation provide an efficient tool for the representation of infinite state systems. ...|$|E

40|$|Operatorless Prolog text is LL(1) {{in nature}} and any {{standard}} LL parser generator tool {{can be used to}} parse it. However, the Prolog text that conforms to the ISO Prolog standard allows the definition of dynamic operators. Since Prolog operators can be defined at run-time, operator symbols are not present in the grammar rules of the language. Unless the parser generator allows for some flexibility in the specification of the grammar rules, {{it is very difficult to}} generate a parser for such text. In this thesis we discuss the existing parsing methods and their modified versions to parse languages with dynamic operator capabilities. Implementation details of a parser using Javacc as <b>a</b> parser <b>generator</b> tool to parse standard Prolog text is provided.

40|$|The {{boundary}} of three-dimensional objects is usually represented by Piecewise Linear Complexes (PLCs). A PLC {{is a set}} of vertices, segments and facets. The definition of PLCs requires that they must be closed under taking intersections; two segments can intersect only at a shared point, and two facets are either completely disjointed or intersecting only at shared segments or vertices. Another restriction of the facets of PLCs is that the point set which defines a facet must be co-planar. These PLCs are input for <b>a</b> tetrahedral mesh <b>generator</b> <b>like</b> (Tetgen, 2006). TetGen generates a Conforming Delaunay Tetrahedronization (CDT) from these PLCs by adding Steiner points where necessary to obey the Delaunay empty circum sphere criterion.

If a boundary marker is assigned to each facet of the PLC, all boundary faces on that facet in the final mesh will have the same boundary marker.
