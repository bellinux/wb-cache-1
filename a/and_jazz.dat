25|$|The 1980s saw {{something}} of a reaction against the fusion <b>and</b> free <b>jazz</b> that had dominated the 1970s. Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis emerged early in the decade, and strove to create music within what he believed was the tradition, rejecting both fusion <b>and</b> free <b>jazz</b> <b>and</b> creating extensions of the small and large forms initially pioneered by artists such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, {{as well as the}} hard bop of the 1950s. It is debatable whether Marsalis' critical and commercial success was a cause or a symptom of the reaction against Fusion <b>and</b> Free <b>Jazz</b> <b>and</b> the resurgence of interest in the kind of jazz pioneered in the 1960s (particularly modal <b>jazz</b> <b>and</b> post-bop); nonetheless there were many other manifestations of a resurgence of traditionalism, even if fusion <b>and</b> free <b>jazz</b> were by no means abandoned and continued to develop and evolve.|$|R

5|$|Another style {{the dance}} {{industry}} created {{in response to}} hip-hop was jazz-funk. This style was shown in its early form on a sketch comedy series called In Living Color. The resident dance troupe, The Fly Girls, opened and closed every show with a hip-hop <b>and</b> <b>jazz</b> performance choreographed by Rosie Perez. Jazz-funk (also called street-jazz) is a hybrid of hip-hop <b>and</b> <b>jazz</b> dance. R singer Beyoncé uses this style. Korean dance crew Prepix also uses this style. They have choreographed for K-pop singers Jay Park and G.NA {{as well as for}} K-pop boy bands 2PM and B2ST. Although jazz-funk borrows from hip-hop dance, it is not considered a style of hip-hop because the foundational movements are jazz. In hip-hop—even in lyrical hip-hop—there are no pirouettes or arabesques and dancers do not perform on relevé (on the balls of the feet). However, these methods are used in jazz-funk and in jazz dance in general.|$|E
