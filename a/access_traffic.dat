40|$|Human {{trafficking}} is {{a global}} phenomenon. The UK is predominantly, although not exclusively, a destination country for trafficked persons (Europol, 2006). It has become apparent through academic research and debate {{that there is a}} lack of empirical research and data available which addresses the reality of <b>access</b> by <b>trafficked</b> persons to certainmeans of communication (internet, mobile phone technology or more traditional means, aPC); therefore meaning that any attempts to use these mediums to assist or identify trafficked individuals are based on speculation rather than empiricism. The aims and objectives of this research are to conduct semi-structured interviews with professionals who work with trafficked people, or in related fields (e. g., Immigration agencies, police, victim support, therapists) (n = 13) with a view to establishing more clearly the level of <b>access</b> <b>trafficked</b> persons/putatively trafficked persons have to communication technology. The participants have been identified through purposive and snowballing sampling techniques(Robson, 2011), and are the best group to utilise as their understandings, as well as attitudes, inform policy and practice in this area. This research looks to identify a general understanding of <b>trafficked</b> people’s <b>access</b> to communication technology; how access to this technology either helps or hinders them escape their current situation; and, consequentially, how understanding the effect of communication technology assists us in how we understand as well as respond to trafficking nationally and internationally...|$|R

Occasionally people from Gibsons, British Columbia or those who have cabins on Keats Island will park a barge or tie {{together}} a series of boats and have a private flotilla party, although this is rare and usually only occurs on peak long weekends. Due to the natural surroundings, lack of vehicle access, and dedication or investment in a marine vehicle to get to the park, the park is lovingly referred to by those who frequent it regularly as [...] "the best campground in BC". Those from Vancouver, British Columbia who frequent the park tend to go back every year on the same weekends at the same time, and tend to not advertise to their fellow city dwellers about the park in order to keep it private and from it getting too busy.|$|E
5000|$|The new {{entertainment}} features {{added to}} the 2009 model year included the optional Ford SYNC, and an all-new DVD-based voice-activated, multi-entertainment/navigational system with liquid crystal touch display. The rearview camera system is now integrated to show the video feed through the navigation screen instead for the rearview mirror, however, the rearview mirror is still used to show images on Expeditions not equipped with the navigation system. The new navigation system features up to 10 gigabytes of storage space for more than 2400 songs, a jukebox function, a screened photo display, iPod/Zune capability for downloading and recharging, ripping CDs, and integrated compatibility for cellphones and Bluetooth; the newly compatible Sirius Travel Link, which allow drivers to <b>access</b> <b>traffic,</b> weather, sports, and local movie listings; and a [...] "Route Guidance" [...] mode for road and street information. The steering wheel also has a tilt feature and radio controls, including Ford SYNC buttons, allowing the driver to press the button and use voice commands to activate the system, which became standard on Eddie Bauer, Limited, and King Ranch. The tilt w/radio control feature was optional on the XLT during its Wayne plant built orders, but after production moved to Louisville it became standard. For accessory purposes, a HD radio can be installed upon request at a Ford dealership in the United States. New for 2009 were standard heated second row outboard seats on the Limited and King Ranch models only with either the second row bench seat or the optional bucket seats.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAs {{a way to}} {{implement}} bus priority policy, bus lane is widely used in various cities for its convenience and low-cost. The operational efficiency of bus lane is related to many factors, among which the form of roadside <b>access</b> <b>traffic</b> is of greater influence. This paper introduces two existing typical forms of <b>access</b> <b>traffic,</b> and uses the VISSIM simulation method to analyze the changing delay of bus flow, main road flow, and access point traffic flow in the different organization forms of <b>access</b> <b>traffic.</b> The appropriate values of the distance between entering points at basic traffic volume are recommended. Further comparative analysis of the delay changing trend is made under different bus flow and access point traffic flow, from which the application of recommended values can be easy seen. The {{results indicate that the}} shorter distance between entering points is better for the bus priority meanwhile brings less negative impacts on the social traffic...|$|E

40|$|Highway Capacity Manual 2010 {{provides}} {{various factors}} {{to adjust the}} base saturation flow rate for the capacity analysis of signalized intersections. No factors, however, is considered for the potential change of signalized intersections capacity caused by the access point closeing to the signalized intersection. This paper presented a theoretical model to estimate the lane group capacity at signalized intersections with the consideration {{of the effects of}} access points. Two scenarios of access point locations, upstream or downstream of the signalized intersection, and impacts of six types of <b>access</b> <b>traffic</b> flow are taken into account. The proposed capacity model was validated based on VISSIM simulation. Results of extensive numerical analysis reveal the substantial impact of access point on the capacity, which has an inverse correlation with both the number of major street lanes and the distance between the intersection and access point. Moreover, among the six types of <b>access</b> <b>traffic</b> flows, the <b>access</b> <b>traffic</b> flow 1 (right-turning traffic from major street), flow 4 (left-turning traffic from access point), and flow 5 (left-turning traffic from major street) cause a more significant effect on lane group capacity than others. Some guidance on the mitigation of the negative effect is provided for practitioners...|$|E
