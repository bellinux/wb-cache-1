25|$|T-55AGM - Ukrainian T-54/T-55 modernization. It {{brings up}} the T-54/T-55 tanks to T-80 standard. It can also be applied to Chinese made Type 59 and Soviet T-62. It is fitted with 5TDFM, {{two-stroke}} liquid-cooled multi-fuel supercharged diesel engine with boxing pistons which develops 850hp (634kW), improved running gear, automated movement control system with a steering handlebar control, additional passive protection, built-in explosive reactive armour, countermeasures system, new fire suppression system with over-ride facilities at the commander's station, <b>automatic</b> <b>loader</b> which holds 18 rounds and anti-aircraft machine gun that can be aimed and fired from within the turret under a complete armour protection. The anti-aircraft machine gun is installed on the commander's cupola and {{is intended to be}} fired at air and ground targets. The buyer can choose between two main armament options: 125mm KBM1 smoothbore gun or 120mm KBM2 smoothbore gun. Both of them with use of enhanced performance conventional ammunition and barrel-launched ATGM can defeat modern tanks form distance of 2000–3000 m and up to 5,000 m using the ATGM. The tank can carry at least 30 rounds. The 125mm KBM1 smoothbore gun weighs 2,5 tonnes, has a barrel length of 6 m (48 calibers) and can fire APFSDS, HEAT and HE-FRAG rounds while 120mm KBM2 smoothbore gun weighs 2,63 tonnes, has a barrel length of 6 m (50 calibers) and can fire all types of ammunition that meet the requirements of NATO standards and Ukrainian-made ATGM. Both guns have normal recoil length of 26–30cm and maximum recoil length of 31cm. The tank can be armed with either the KT-7.62 or the PKT-7.62 coaxial machine gun and can carry 3,000 rounds for it. The tank can also be armed with either KT-12.7 or NSVT-12.7 heavy machine gun for AA protection and can carry 450 rounds for it. The approximate successful range is 2km during day and 800 m during night. The AA HMG can be elevated between -5 to +70 degrees. The remote control for anti-aircraft machine gun is stabilized in the vertical axis during automatic mode (by using the TKN-5 sight) and is using the PZU-7 sight for semi-automatic mode.|$|E
500|$|Engineers {{believe the}} weapon {{can only be}} used with an <b>automatic</b> <b>loader</b> and new turret design. [...] The gun {{commenced}} static firing trials at Rheinmetall's proving ground following Eurosatory, while engineers hope to receive a new NATO standard {{by the end of}} 2016, although development of the gun and ammunition will likely take 8–10 years. [...] The 130mm is designed to equip the Main Ground Combat System (MGCS), a joint effort between Germany and France to produce a successor to the Leopard 2 and Leclerc, possibly to be launched between 2025-2030.|$|E
500|$|In 1963, Germany and the United States {{had already}} {{embarked}} on a joint tank program, known as the MBT-70. The new tank carried a three-man crew, with the driver in the turret, an <b>automatic</b> <b>loader</b> for the main gun, a [...] autocannon as secondary armament, an active hydropneumatic suspension and spaced armour on the glacis plate and the front turret. The new tank concept also had improved armament, a [...] missile-launching main gun, designed to fire the MGM-51 Shillelagh anti-tank missile. However, the German Army was interested in a tank gun which could fire conventional ammunition. Although there were attempts to modify the [...] tank gun to do so, the process proved extremely difficult, and the Germans began development of the future Rheinmetall 120mm gun instead.|$|E

50|$|The {{advent of}} jet aircraft, {{and the rate}} of fire {{required}} to engage them, hastened the adoption of <b>automatic</b> <b>loaders</b> on naval artillery. Development of the loading systems was often problematic, and reliability was seriously compromised in many cases. The US 5"/54 Mark 42 was derated from 40 rounds per minute to 34 to improve reliability. The Soviet/Russian AK-130 was so badly delayed that the missile cruiser Kirov (later Admiral Ushakov) was forced to use two older weapons in its place. The US 3"/70 Mark 37 actually spent more time in design (13 years) than in service (12 years) due to severe unreliability. These problems are largely of the past and the field has advanced a great deal.|$|R
50|$|As solutions, <b>automatic</b> <b>loaders</b> and unloaders may {{be useful}} for the poultry {{industry}} (although this topic is under debate due to high level of noise from those machines). Personnel training for humane catching by closing the wings, instead of grabbing birds by legs, is under review. It is thought that reduction of bruises, pain and fear (of humans or machinery) can {{have a positive effect}} on meat quality and welfare. Following transportation and unloading, animals should be given an extensive rest period before stunning (referred to as lairage) to allow animals to recover homeostasis, especially regarding lactic acid removal from tissues and glycogen reserves reestablishment. Stunning methods can play a large role in meat quality. Current research suggests that a two phase gas chamber may be best for minimizing stress. During summer time or in hot countries, the truck design should be taken into consideration, and passive ventilation and water shower before leaving the farm can have a positive effect and reduce the occurrence of PSE by up to 66.3%, which can be done by costless modifications.|$|R

50|$|Smaller {{computers}} {{often use}} less flexible but more <b>automatic</b> boot <b>loader</b> mechanisms {{to ensure that}} the computer starts quickly and with a predetermined software configuration. In many desktop computers, for example, the bootstrapping process begins with the CPU executing software contained in ROM (for example, the BIOS of an IBM PC) at a predefined address (some CPUs, including the Intel x86 series are designed to execute this software after reset without outside help). This software contains rudimentary functionality to search for devices eligible to participate in booting, and load a small program from a special section (most commonly the boot sector) of the most promising device, typically starting at a fixed entry point such as the start of the sector.|$|R
40|$|Sample {{presentation}} {{is a key}} aspect {{in order to obtain}} a representative diffraction pattern when using a reflection geometry such as Bragg-Brentano. In Bragg-Brentano geometry the avoidance of preferred orientation, sample displacement and surface roughness would be goals of any sample presentation technique. A mixture of 90 wt % gypsum and 10 wt % corundum was prepared by miconising in a McCrone mill. Sufficient quantity of the mixture was prepared to enable more than 15 presentations on the prepared sample using an <b>automatic</b> sample <b>loader</b> for the diffractometer. The specimens were back-pressed with and without a 38 um nylon sieve mesh on the front face. For this material, the sieve mesh on removal appears to leave a presentation surface that is preferable to that produced by back-pressing without the mesh. The diffraction patterns for the sets of 15 presentations were modelled with TOPAS to determine the stability of parameters such as preferred orientation, specimen displacement, scale factors and weighted R factor...|$|R

40|$|Most modern high {{performance}} storage systems store data in large repositories of removable media volumes. Management of the removable volumes is {{performed by a}} software module known as a Physical Volume Library (PVL). To meet performance and scalability requirements, a PVL {{may be asked to}} mount multiple removable media volumes for use by a single client for parallel data transfer. Mounting sets of volumes creates an environment in which it impossible for multiple client requests to deadlock while attempting to gain access to storage resources. Scenarios leading to deadlock in a PVL include multiple client requests that contend for the same cartridge(s), and client requests that vie for a limited set of drive resources. These deadlock scenarios are further complicated by the potential for out-of-order volumes to be mounted (for example, by <b>Automatic</b> Cartridge <b>Loaders</b> or human operators). This paper begins by introducing those PVL requirements Which create the possibility of deadlock. Next we examine traditional approaches to deadlock resolution and how they might be applied in a PVL. This leads to a design for a PVL which addresses deadlock scenarios. Following the design presentation is a discussion of possible design enhancements. We end with a case study of an actual implementation of the PVL design in the High Performance Storage System (HPSS) ...|$|R
