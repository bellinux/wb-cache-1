40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a parametric study on aerodynamic {{performance of a}} transonic <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> combined with a casing groove and tip injection using three-dimensional Reynolds-average Navier-Stokes equations. The front and rear lengths and height of the groove are selected as the geometric parameters to investigate their effects on the stall margin and peak adiabatic efficiency. These parameters are changed with constant injection. The validation of the numerical results is performed in comparison with experimental data for the total pressure ratio and adiabatic efficiency. As {{the results of the}} parametric study, the maximum stall margin and peak adiabatic efficiency are obtained in the <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> having 70 % groove height of the reference groove. The stall margin and peak adiabatic efficiency in other cases are also improved in comparison with the <b>axial</b> <b>compressors</b> with the smooth casing and reference groove. The results show that both the stall margin and the peak adiabatic efficiency are considerably improved by the application of the casing groove combined with tip injection in an <b>axial</b> <b>compressor...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractWith {{increasing}} computing power, Large Eddy Simulation {{could be}} a useful simulation tool for gas turbine <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> design. This paper outlines a series of simulations performed on compressor geometries, ranging from a Controlled Diffusion Cascade stator blade to the periodic sector of a stage in a 3. 5 stage <b>axial</b> <b>compressor.</b> The simulation results show that LES may offer advantages over traditional RANS methods when off-design conditions are considered – flow regimes where RANS models often fail to converge. The time-dependent nature of LES permits the resolution of transient flow structures, and can elucidate new mechanisms of vorticity generation on blade surfaces. It is shown that accurate LES is heavily reliant on both the near-wall mesh fidelity {{and the ability of}} the imposed inflow condition to recreate the conditions found in the reference experiment. For components embedded in a compressor this requires the generation of turbulence fluctuations at the inlet plane. A recycling method is developed that improves the quality of the flow in a single stage calculation of an <b>axial</b> <b>compressor,</b> and indicates that future developments in both the recycling technique and computing power will bring simulations of <b>axial</b> <b>compressors</b> within reach of industry in the coming years...|$|R

Pressure on delivering robust product with cost economy is in demand in each development. Even though technology is older, it is new for each customer requirement and highly non-liner to fit one in another place. Gas turbine {{is considered one of}} a complex design in the aircraft system. It involves experts to be grouped with designers of various segments to arrive the best output.

50|$|<b>Axial</b> <b>compressors</b> {{are used}} in medium- to large-thrust gas turbine engines, because the {{alternative}} centrifugal units would be too heavy and too large in the cross-sectional area. At smaller sizes, the axial blading {{at the rear of}} the compressor loses its robustness and is difficult to manufacture accurately. Consequently, manufacturers tend to replace the rear stages with a centrifugal unit. The compression system is then said to be axial-centrifugal.

40|$|Abstract. This work {{investigates the}} effects of {{circumferential}} casing grooves on stall flow characteristics of a transonic <b>axial</b> <b>compressor.</b> Numerical analysis is conducted by solving three-dimensional steady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the shear stress transport turbulence model. The results of flow analysis for an <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> with smooth casing are validated in comparison with experimental data for the pressure ratio and adiabatic efficiency. The numerical stall inception point is identified from the last converged point by convergence criteria, and the stall margin is predicted numerically. The peak adiabatic efficiency point is also obtained by reducing the normalized mass flow in the high mass flow region. In order to {{explore the influence of}} number of the circumferential casing grooves on the performance of the compressor, the stall margins and peak adiabatic efficiencies are evaluated compared to the case smooth casing. The stability of the <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> with circumferential casing grooves is found to be sensitively influenced by the number of grooves...|$|R

The results show that noise with specific frequency structures appear in the <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> under a pre-arranged structure adjustment and the specific operating conditions, and the noise spectrum characteristics are analyzed detailedly. Some influence factors such as rotating speed and corrected mass flow rate on noise characteristics are discussed emphatically.
