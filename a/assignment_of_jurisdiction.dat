Functional classification is a requirement of House File 394 (Functional Highway Classification Bill) enacted by the 63 rd General Assembly of the Iowa Legislature.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of management institutions for the British Columbia salmon fishery is examined, focussing on {{the period from}} 1900 to 1930. Various property rights allocations, including exclusive fishing rights, limited fishing licences, and limited processing licences were tried and abandoned, usually because {{of social and political}} pressures and lack of full appreciation of the common property character of the fishery. Opportunities for appropriating rent were surrendered. By 1930 management evolved to open access with various restrictions on effort. Jurisdictional disputes hindered and complicated management. After a flawed <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> at the creation of Canada both the Canadian and British Columbia governments claimed fisheries management authority. Jurisdiction over fisheries had been assigned to the federal government. But, with jurisdiction over property assigned to the provincial governments and legally established property rights in fisheries, the stage was set for a series of conflicts and court cases before management responsibilities were clarified. Internationally, Canadians and Americans both claimed the right to exploit certain salmon stocks. By 1930 the essential elements of a treaty were negotiated, but not finally ratified by both countries until 1937...|$|E
40|$|As {{the facts}} {{that led to the}} Dow Jones/Gutnick-decision of the High Court of Australia (10 December 2002) illustrate, the Internet is a {{powerful}} platform for communication. Its continuous worldwide accessibility urges discussion of a number of questions regarding tort jurisdiction. These are the starting points for some critical remarks regarding states' reciprocal claims to cross-border activities {{and the way in which}} they deal with the interests of the involved parties. For tort jurisdiction, the paper proposes and applies criteria for the assessment of the place where the harmful event has occurred or may occur (art. 5, subsection 3 Regulation 44 / 2001), as explained by the European Court of Justice of the European Union. Special attention is hereby given to some particularities that characterize Internet torts. On the one hand it concerns the alleged global <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> that art. 5, subsection 3 may lead to and on the other hand the scope of the assigned jurisdiction in the court of the place where the damage occurs. The European approach is confronted with the principles of personal jurisdiction that are embedded in long arm statutes and the Due Process Clause, as applied in some leading American cases regarding Internet jurisdiction. It leads to suggestions regarding the development of a marginal test for the reasonableness of the jurisdiction art. 5, subsection 3 could lead to in a particular case, as well from the point of view of the weight of the connecting factor as to the scope of the jurisdiction that is based upon it...|$|E

40|$|This manual {{provides}} {{a set of}} procedural rules and regulations for use in functionally classifying all roads and streets in Iowa according {{to the character of}} service they are intended to provide. Functional classification is a requirement of the 1973 Code of Iowa (Chapter 306) as amended by Senate File 1062 enacted by the 2 nd session of the 65 th General Assembly of Iowa. Functional classification is defined as the grouping of roads and streets into systems according to the character of service they will be expected to provide, and the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over each class to the governmental unit having primary interest in each type of service. Stated objectives of the legislation are: "Functional classification will serve the legislator by providing an equitable basis for determination of proper source of tax support and providing for the assignment of financial resources to the governmental unit having responsibility for each class of service. Functional classification promotes the ability of the administrator to effectively prepare and carry out long range programs which reflect the transportation needs of the public. " All roads and streets in legal existence will be classified. Instructions are also included in this manual for a continuous reporting to the Highway Commission of changes in classification and/or jurisdiction resulting from new construction, corporation line changes, relocations, and deletions. This continuous updating of records is absolutely essential for modern day transportation planning as it is the only possible way to monitor the status of existing road systems, and consequently determine adequacy and needs with accuracy...|$|E

40|$|When private {{international}} law lawyers discuss jurisdiction, focus is typically placed primarily on personal jurisdiction, and secondarily on subject matter jurisdiction. This article seeks to demonstrate {{that there is a}} third matter – what we can call scope <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> or perhaps scope <b>of</b> remedial <b>jurisdiction</b> – that needs to be considered. Scope <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> relates to the appropriate geographical scope of orders rendered by a court that has personal jurisdiction and subject matter jurisdiction.

The thesis is systematically divided into seven chapters. First chapter briefly define the concept of obligation and is dedicated to changes in subject of obligations based on the will of the parties. The second chapter analyses the historical development <b>of</b> <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> a claim.

In particular, the rules <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> are derived from national rules with a long history, dating back to times when patterns of commerce were entirely different.

The UNCITRAL Convention on the <b>Assignment</b> <b>of</b> Receivables in International Trade (“the UNCITRAL Convention”) was adopted in 2001 by the General Assembly. The UNCITRAL Convention was prepared to establish a sophisticated, comprehensive and potentially far-reaching model for the modernisation <b>of</b> domestic <b>assignment</b> laws <b>of</b> countries and a substantive step for harmonisation of the law <b>of</b> <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> receivables in international trade. The UNCITRAL Convention not only affects assignment transactions but also securitisation and project financing. The key objective of the UNCITRAL Convention is to facilitate the cross-border flow of credit and to {{lower the cost of}} credit through harmonisation of rules that govern assignments which will lead to greater predictability and certainty in the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> receivables contracts.
