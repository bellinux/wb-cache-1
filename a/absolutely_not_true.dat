This accusation is <b>absolutely</b> <b>not</b> <b>true.</b> The process of conclusion making in the science and the religion is something different. Religion is based on faith and science is based on human investigation or rational and logical facts. Quranic verses contain hints and a lot of scientific facts, but they are not scientific theories. Reading in the meaning of studying the nature is the first order from the Almighty God to prophet Muhammad. Nature and all creatures are created in balance. Creatures are all in pairs. Nature is prepared and maintained in systematic mechanism. Photosynthesis is considered to be the first chain of living mechanism of creatures which depend on food and on the supply of fire (energy) as stated in verse 80 chapter Ya Sin.

This assumption would be reasonable in a small region near the global minimum, but <b>not</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>true</b> for real video signals. To avoid trapped in undesirable local minimum, some adaptive search algorithms have been devised intending to achieve the global optimum or sub-optimum with adaptive search patterns.

If those facts are <b>not</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>true</b> (and the actual malice standard is not taken into account) then the defendant could be sued by the plaintiff for damages, although the plaintiff would need to establish to the satisfaction of a jury that the statements were defamatory, and that the defendant published or made them.|$|R
40|$|At present, most {{effective}} algorithms {{to find a}} Hamilton circle in an undirected graph are generally based on the Rotation-Extension method developed by Posa. However, due to the deficiencies of Posa's method, such algorithms are mostly useful for very dense graphs. This article creates a method called "Enlarged Rotation-Extension" that modifies and extends Posa's method, overcoming its deficiencies. By introducing the concepts: broad cycle, a cut and insert, main goal Hamilton cycle, main segment, good edge, good main segment, depth-first search tree, good path, good descendant, we develop a polynomial time algorithm for this problem and give a proof for it. This is the final version. I just deleted a little bug (deleted the problem 1 of the last version, {{it is not a}} problem, so three problems become two problems, then much easier to understand) from the last version. I am very sure the algorithm and the proof are <b>ABSOLUTELY</b> <b>true</b> (<b>not</b> only by thinking but also by program (code)). Though this version may still contains some little bugs (including English expression), the bugs cannot affect the correctness and can be solved easily. If you are a expert on algorithm in this world, if you are a famous and a powerful guy on algorithm in this world, if you are a referee or an editor of a famous algorithm journal, please open your eyes, use your brain, read this paper and think, you will get it and believe it. The best way to understand other people's thinking is: try it yourself! If you cannot understand this paper, try it yourself according to the paper's logic, use your brain. Do not close your eyes and rest your brain. If some one say: this part of your paper is wrong, then I say: it is not wrong, I explain. And if some one say: this part can not be understood, can you explain? then, I explain. Comment: 15 pages, a little revision. I am very sure the algorithm and the proof are <b>ABSOLUTELY</b> <b>true</b> (<b>not</b> only by thinking but also by program (code) ...|$|R

60|$|It {{has often}} been said in favour of French society, that once within the doors of a salon, all are equal. This is not {{literally}} so, it being impossible that such a state of things can exist; nor is it desirable that it should, since it is confounding all sentiment and feeling, overlooking the claims of age, services, merit of every sort, and setting at nought the whole construction of society. It is <b>not</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>true</b> that even rank is entirely forgotten in French society, though I think it sufficiently so to prevent any deference to it from being offensive. The social pretensions of a French peer are exceedingly well regulated, nor do I remember to have seen an instance in which a very young man has been particularly noticed {{on account of his}} having claims of this sort. Distinguished men are so very numerous in Paris, that they excite no great feeling, and the even course of society is little disturbed on their account.|$|R
