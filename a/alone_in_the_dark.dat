5|$|The {{internal}} {{structure of the}} ear, which has large numbers of auditory neurons, gives an improved ability to detect low-frequency sounds at a distance, which could include rustling made by prey moving in vegetation. The tawny owl's hearing is ten times better than a human's, and it can hunt using this sense <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> of a woodland on an overcast night, but the patter of raindrops {{makes it difficult to}} detect faint sounds, and prolonged wet weather can lead to starvation if the owl cannot hunt effectively.|$|E
5|$|In {{this kind}} of system, the {{developers}} set {{the properties of the}} camera, such as its position, orientation or field of view, during the game creation. The camera views will not change dynamically, so the same place will always be shown under the same set of views. An early example of {{this kind of}} camera system can be seen in <b>Alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark.</b> While the characters are in 3D, the background on which they evolve has been pre-rendered. The early Resident Evil games are notable examples of games that use fixed cameras. The God of War series of video games is also known for this technique.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{gameplay}} of Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth comprises unarmed {{escape and}} evasion together with investigative exploration, although first-person shooter (FPS) style combat is introduced later on. As with most survival horror video games, ammunition is limited {{and must be}} conserved carefully for situations when it will really be indispensable, occasionally requiring the player to avoid combat even when armed. The game {{as a whole is}} heavily scripted and very linear, with only one path through the chapters from start to finish, in contrast with some earlier survival horror games such as the original <b>Alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> (which itself was inspired by the Mythos).|$|E

5|$|Resident Evil 4 {{redefined the}} {{survival}} horror genre by emphasizing reflexes and precision aiming, thus broadening the gameplay {{of the series}} with elements from the wider action game genre. However, this also led some reviewers {{to suggest that the}} Resident Evil series had abandoned the survival horror genre, by demolishing the genre conventions that it had established. Other major survival horror series followed suit, by developing their combat systems to feature more action, such as Silent Hill Homecoming and the 2008 version of <b>Alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark.</b> These changes represent an overall trend among console games shifting towards visceral action gameplay. While working on The Last of Us, Naughty Dog took cues from Resident Evil 4, particularly the tension and action.|$|E
5|$|During {{principal}} photography, Noonan {{asked that}} no one playing his victims and pursuers be allowed to see him, while those he did speak to should address him by his character's name, Francis. The first time Noonan met Petersen was when Petersen jumped through a large window during the filming of the climactic fight scene. Noonan admits that, because of his request, the atmosphere on set became so tense that people actually became afraid of him. He had also begun body-building {{to prepare for the}} role and felt that his size intimidated the crew when filming began, as the first scene to be shot was his character's interrogation and murder of another. Noonan claims that this led him to take separate flights and stay in separate hotels {{from the rest of the}} cast, and while on the film's sets, he would remain in his trailer <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> to prepare himself, sometimes joined by a silent Mann.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Riverhillsoft {{released}} the first fully 3D survival horror game, Doctor Hauzer, for the 3DO. Both the player {{character and the}} environment are rendered entirely in polygons, while allowing the player to switch the view between three different perspectives: third-person, first-person, and overhead view. In a departure from most other survival horror games before and after it, Doctor Hauzer lacks any enemies; the main threat is instead the sentient house that the game takes place in, with the player having to survive the house's traps and solve puzzles. It also uses background music that heightens tension and changes depending on the situation, {{and the sound of}} the player character's echoing footsteps can change depending on the surface; these would later be used in Resident Evil. The game is today considered a formative step in the creation of the survival horror genre, improving on <b>Alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark.</b>|$|E

For all that, he put them carefully away in a leather case which he carried in an inside pocket.|$|R
5|$|In 2005, Resident Evil 4 {{attempted}} {{to redefine the}} genre by emphasizing reflexes and precision aiming, broadening the gameplay with elements from the wider action genre. Its ambitions paid off, earning the title several Game of the Year awards for 2005, and the top rank on IGN's Readers' Picks Top 99 Games list. However, this also led some reviewers {{to suggest that the}} Resident Evil series had abandoned the survival horror genre, by demolishing the genre conventions that it had established.

These changes in gameplay have led some purists to suggest that the genre has deteriorated into the conventions of other action games. Jim Sterling suggests that the genre lost its core gameplay when it improved the combat interface, thus shifting the gameplay away from hiding and running towards direct combat. Leigh Alexander argues that this represents a shift towards more Western horror aesthetics, which emphasize action and gore rather than the psychological experience of Japanese horror.|$|E

500|$|In 1992, Infogrames {{released}} <b>Alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark,</b> {{which has}} been considered a forefather of the genre. The game featured a lone protagonist against hordes of monsters, and [...] made use of traditional adventure game challenges such as puzzle-solving and finding hidden keys to new areas. Graphically, <b>Alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> utilized static prerendered camera views that were cinematic in nature. Although players {{had the ability to}} fight monsters as in action games, players also had the option to evade or block them. Many monsters could not be killed, and thus could only be dealt with using problem-solving abilities. The game also used the mechanism of notes and books as expository devices. Many of these elements were used in later survival horror games, and thus the game is credited with making the survival horror genre possible.|$|E
500|$|The self-titled Strapping Young Lad was {{released}} on February 11, 2003, and became the band's first charting album, entering Billboards Top Heatseekers at No.97. The album received moderate critical success, Nate Smith from Rockzone.com called it a [...] "solid addition to the Townsend catalog", but [...] "not an instant classic", Xander Hoose from Chronicles of Chaos called it [...] "a good album", but also pointed out it is inferior to City. Strapping Young Lad differed from City because it was less industrial and more reminiscent of death metal; the humor pervading the previous two albums became more subdued. The song Devour would later appear on the soundtrack for the 2005 film <b>Alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark.</b>|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "survival horror" [...] {{was first}} used for the {{original}} Japanese release of Resident Evil in 1996, which was influenced by earlier games with a horror theme such as 1989's Sweet Home or 1992's <b>Alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark.</b> The name has been used since then for games with similar gameplay, and has been retroactively applied to earlier titles. Starting {{with the release of}} Resident Evil 4 in 2005, the genre began to incorporate more features from action games and more traditional first person and third-person shooter games. This has led game journalists to question whether long-standing survival horror franchises and more recent franchises have abandoned the genre and moved into a different distinct genre often referred to as [...] "action horror". Still, the survival horror genre has persisted in one form or another.|$|E

500|$|The term [...] "survival horror" [...] {{was first}} used by Capcom to market their 1996 release, Resident Evil. It began as a remake of Sweet Home, {{borrowing}} various elements from the game, such as its mansion setting, puzzles, [...] "opening door" [...] load screen, death animations, multiple endings depending on which characters survive, dual character paths, individual character skills, limited item management, story told through diary entries and frescos, emphasis on atmosphere, and horrific imagery. Resident Evil also adopted several features seen in <b>Alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark,</b> notably its cinematic fixed camera angles and pre-rendered backdrops. The control scheme in Resident Evil also became {{a staple of the}} genre, and future titles imitated its challenge of rationing very limited resources and items. The game's commercial success is credited with helping the PlayStation become the dominant game console, and also led to a series of Resident Evil films. Many games have tried to replicate the successful formula seen in Resident Evil, and every subsequent survival horror game has arguably taken a stance in relation to it.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{relative}} {{failure of the}} project as a whole, the individual games of the Capcom Five had a lasting impact on game design. After experimenting with action gameplay in P.N.03, Mikami was able to apply his experience to Vanquish, which serves as an evolution and refinement of the former's gameplay. On the other hand, Adam Sorice of Nintendojo suggested that P.N.03s stereotypically sexy all-female cast had unfortunate implications for gender equality in gaming. He also opined that the commercial failure of such a women-driven game made Capcom reluctant to feature female leads in future games {{for a number of}} years. Beyond its critical success, Resident Evil 4 {{became one of the most}} influential games of the decade. Its [...] "over-the-shoulder" [...] perspective has inspired third-person shooters and action games as diverse as Gears of War and [...] Leon's precision-aiming laser sight has also found its way into Dead Space and Grand Theft Auto, as an alternative to [...] "lock-on" [...] targeting. On a broader scale, Resident Evil 4 deconstructed the survival horror conventions the first Resident Evil games established. Some reviewers accused the game of abandoning the genre's essence by adopting an increased emphasis on action and combat. Following Resident Evil 4s lead, many [...] "horror" [...] games in the next few years would shift toward more combat-heavy gameplay, including [...] and <b>Alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark.</b>|$|E
