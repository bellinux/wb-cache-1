The decline may be due to loss of habitat to urban sprawl, especially grasslands, forests and wetlands, energy development and industrialized agriculture. Climate change could compound losses in the future.|$|E

5|$|Great {{white sharks}} were {{previously}} thought to reach sexual maturity at around 15 years of age, but are now believed to take far longer; male great white sharks reach sexual maturity at age 26, while females take 33 {{years to reach}} sexual maturity.

Examinations of vertebral growth ring count gave a maximum male age of 73 years and a maximum female age of 40 years for the specimens studied.

5|$|In 2010, {{fipronil}} {{was blamed}} for the spread of CCD among bees, in <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Minutes-Association for Technical Coordination Fund in France, which found that even at very low nonlethal doses, this pesticide still impairs the ability to locate the hive, resulting in large numbers of foragers lost with every pollen-finding expedition, though no mention was made regarding {{any of the other}} symptoms of CCD; other studies, however, have shown no acute effect of fipronil on honey bees. Fipronil is designed to eliminate insects similar to bees, such as yellowjackets (Vespula germanica) and many other colonial pests by a process of 'toxic baiting', whereby one insect returning to the hive spreads the pesticide among the brood.|$|E

5|$|The parkway was {{proposed}} to help bridge {{a gap in}} the eastern part of the Long Island Parkway system. Construction began in 1949 with the opening of an interchange between Bay Shore Road and the Southern State Parkway. Work on the parkway itself began the following year, with plans calling for connections to three spurs: the Captree State Parkway (now Robert Moses Causeway), the Sunken Meadow Spur (Sunken Meadow State Parkway), and the Heckscher Spur (Heckscher State Parkway). The parkway was completed in 1952, closing the highway loop on Long Island.

Situations in which the UN has not only acted to keep the peace but also intervened include the Korean War (1950–53) and the authorization of intervention in Iraq after the Gulf War (1990–91).|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the United States and Western European {{countries}} {{introduced legislation}} to reduce lead air pollution. The impact was significant: while {{a study conducted}} by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States in 1976–1980 showed that 77.8% of population had elevated blood lead levels, in 1991–1994, <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> same institute showed the share of people with such high levels dropped to 2.2%.

The share of the world's lead production by the Eastern Bloc increased from 10% to 30%, from 1950 to 1990, with the Soviet Union being the world's largest producer during the mid-1970s and the 1980s, and China starting major lead production in the late 20th century. Unlike the European communist countries, China was largely unindustrialized by the mid-20th century; in 2004, China surpassed Australia as the largest producer of lead. As was the case during European industrialization, lead has had a negative effect on health in China.|$|E
