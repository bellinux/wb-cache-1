5|$|During mid-1997, Jackson and Walsh {{began writing}} with Stephen Sinclair. Sinclair's partner, Philippa Boyens, {{was a major}} fan {{of the book and}} joined the writing team after reading their treatment. It took 13–14 months to write the two film scripts, which were 147 and 144 pages respectively. Sinclair left the project due to {{theatrical}} obligations. Amongst their revisions, Sam is caught eavesdropping and forced to go along with Frodo, instead of Sam, Merry, and Pippin figuring out <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>One</b> Ring themselves and voluntarily going along after confronting Frodo about it, as occurs in the original novel. Gandalf's account of his time at Orthanc was pulled out of flashback and Lothlórien was cut, with Galadriel doing what she does in the story at Rivendell. Denethor attends the Council with his son. Other changes included having Arwen rescue Frodo, and the action sequence involving the cave troll. The writers also considered having Arwen absorb Éowyn's role entirely by having her kill the Witch-king.|$|E
2500|$|According to Guru Nanak, {{the goal}} is to attain the [...] "attendant balance of separation-fusion, self-other, action-inaction, attachment-detachment, in the course of daily life", the polar {{opposite}} to a self-centered existence. Nanak talks further <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> God or Akal (timelessness) that permeates all life). and which must be seen with 'the inward eye', or the 'heart', of a human being.|$|E
2500|$|Bombadil {{does not}} seem {{concerned}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>One</b> Ring, though he seems to know {{at least as much}} as the hobbits about its provenance and power. Although the deliberations at the Council of Elrond at Rivendell suggest that Bombadil would be vulnerable to Sauron if the latter recovered the Ring, Bombadil seems unaffected by the Ring's power and more concerned with keeping his own [...] "country" [...] around the Withywindle in order.|$|E

2500|$|The band's early rock {{influences}} include The Beatles and The Velvet Underground {{as well as}} Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone and Frank Zappa. The band {{have admitted}} that the beginning of Can's [...] "Father Cannot Yell" [...] {{was inspired by the}} Velvet Underground's [...] "European Son". Malcolm Mooney's voice has been compared to that of James Brown (an acknowledged hero of the band members) and their early style, rooted in psychedelic music, drew comparisons with Pink Floyd. Along with their peers in the krautrock scene, they were {{under the influence of the}} wider progressive rock movement taking place in England and elsewhere during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Czukay's extensive editing has occasionally been compared to the late-'60s music of trumpeter Miles Davis (such as In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew): Can and Davis both would record long groove-intensive improvisations, then edit the best bits together for their albums. Czukay and Teo Macero (Davis's producer and editor) both had roots in the musique concrète of the 1940s and '50s. Irmin Schmidt stated in a discussion with Michael Karoli in 1996 concerning the various citations of influences upon their music: [...] "You know, it's funny that in spite of all the supposed influences on us that have been written <b>about,</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> overriding influence has never been mentioned: Michael von Biel." ...|$|E
