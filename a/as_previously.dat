5|$|A 2008 {{study by}} John Fregeau of 13 {{globular}} clusters in the Milky Way shows {{that three of}} them have an unusually large number of X-ray sources, or X-ray binaries, suggesting the clusters are middle-aged. Previously, these globular clusters had been classified as being in old age because they had very tight concentrations of stars in their centers, another test of age used by astronomers. The implication is that most globular clusters, including the other ten studied by Fregeau, are not in middle age <b>as</b> <b>previously</b> thought, but are actually in 'adolescence'.|$|E

5|$|Although {{satellite}} {{males are}} on average slightly smaller and lighter than residents, the nutrition of the chicks does not, <b>as</b> <b>previously</b> thought, influence mating strategy; rather, the inherited mating strategy influences body size. Resident-type chicks will, if {{provided with the}} same amount of food, grow heavier than satellite-type chicks. Satellite males do not have to expend energy to defend a territory, and can spend more time foraging, so they {{do not need to be}} as bulky as the residents; indeed, since they fly more, there would be a physiological cost to additional weight.|$|E

Sesma was forced to send reinforcements, and the Texians were eventually killed. Sesma reported that this skirmish involved 50Texians, but Edmondson believes that number was inflated.|$|E

5|$|Bulgarian {{historian}} Hristo Matanov conjectures {{that after}} 1355, John may have minted his own coinage intended for trade with partners outside the inner Balkans.

The new reading, which would identify the coins as being minted by John, was proposed by Yugoslav numismatist Nedeljković, who rejects the initial attribution of these coins to Jovan Oliver.|$|E
