25|$|A digital {{computer}} simulation model of an <b>analog</b> <b>system</b> {{such as the}} brain is an approximation that introduces random quantization errors and distortion. However, the biological neurons also suffer from randomness and limited precision, for example due to background noise. The errors of the discrete model can be made smaller than the randomness of the biological brain by choosing a sufficiently high variable resolution and sample rate, and sufficiently accurate models of non-linearities. The computational power and computer memory must however be sufficient to run such large simulations, preferably in real time.|$|E
25|$|Since around 2010 a {{nationwide}} digital radio communication standard is implemented. This {{is based on}} the Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) standards. Main advances over the old analog radio system are availability of far more channels and communication groups, encryption possibilities, noise filtering and enhanced signal reliability. To cover whole Germany about 4500 base stations are needed. As of August 2015 already 4338 of them are installed and 4323 working, thus about 97% of Germany is covered. Migration to the new radio standard is ongoing step by step, parallel use of the <b>analog</b> <b>system</b> is planned until around 2020.|$|E

500|$|Unlike the YF-17, {{which had}} {{hydromechanical}} controls {{serving as a}} backup to the FBW, General Dynamics took the innovative step of eliminating mechanical linkages between the control stick and rudder pedals, and the flight control surfaces. The F-16 is entirely reliant on its electrical systems to relay flight commands, instead of traditional mechanically-linked controls, leading to the early moniker of [...] "the electric jet". The quadruplex design permits [...] "graceful degradation" [...] in flight control response in {{that the loss of}} one channel renders the FLCS a [...] "triplex" [...] system. The FLCC began as an <b>analog</b> <b>system</b> on the A/B variants, but has been supplanted by a digital computer system beginning with the F-16C/D Block 40. The F-16's controls suffered from a sensitivity to static electricity or electrostatic discharge (ESD). Up to 70–80% of the C/D models' electronics were vulnerable to ESD.|$|E
500|$|Modern Warfare – Reflex Edition was ported by Treyarch. The Wii {{version of}} Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare has fewer {{features}} {{than the other}} console versions. It does not support split-screen multiplayer, and the graphics are not as developed. However, it supports co-operative gameplay in the campaign on a single screen. At any moment, a second Wii remote can be activated giving the second player their own aiming crosshairs. The game received an aggregated score of 76% on Metacritic. IGN gave the Wii version of the game, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare – Reflex Edition, a score of 7.0, saying the visuals and pointer controls are not as polished as the Wii version of , though they did mention the customization options and multiplayer are impressive. Official Nintendo Magazine gave it 80%, praising it for packing everything from its next-gen counterpart, but again criticizing the visuals. GameTrailers gave the game an 8.8, saying that despite some sacrifices, it retains everything good from its original version. Game Informer scored the game at a 6.5, stating that while the game was rather poor graphically, even by Wii standards, the bigger problem was the Wii remote, stating {{that it did not}} have enough buttons to support Modern Warfare's control scheme, and also that it was quite imprecise, contrasting it with the dual <b>analog</b> <b>system</b> used by the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, and the mouse and keyboard system on the Windows version of the game. GameSpot gave the game an 8.5, stating that the online was as addictive as the other versions, they also said that the controls [...] "are precise and customizable enough to let you be all you can be".|$|E
