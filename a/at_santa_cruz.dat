5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, {{following}} the major decline in brown pelican numbers in Louisiana from DDT poisoning, 500 pelicans were imported from Florida to augment and re-establish the population; over 300 subsequently died in April and May 1975 from poisoning by the pesticide endrin. About 14,000 pelicans, including 7500 American white pelicans, perished from botulism after eating {{fish from the}} Salton Sea in 1990. In 1991 abnormal numbers of brown pelicans and Brandt's cormorants died <b>at</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz,</b> California, when their food fish (anchovies) were contaminated with neurotoxic domoic acid, produced by the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia.|$|E
5|$|Crewmen aboard São Paulo rebelled on 4 November 1924, when First Lieutenant Hercolino Cascardo, seven second lieutenants and 260 others commandeered the ship. After the boilers were fired, São Paulos mutineers {{attempted}} to entice the crews of Minas Geraes {{and the other}} ships nearby to join. They were only able to sway the crew of one old torpedo boat to the cause. The battleship's crew, angry that Minas Geraes would not join them, fired a six-pounder at Minas Geraes that wounded a cook. The mutineers then sailed out of the Rio de Janeiro's harbor, where the forts <b>at</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz</b> and Copacabana engaged her, damaging São Paulos fire control system and funnel. The forts stopped firing soon after the battleship returned fire due to concern over possible civilian casualties. The crewmen aboard São Paulo {{attempted to}} join revolutionaries in Rio Grande do Sul, but when {{they found that the}} rebel forces had moved inland, they set course for Montevideo, Uruguay. They arrived on 10 November, where the rebellious members of the crew disembarked and were granted asylum, and Minas Geraes, which had been pursuing São Paulo, escorted the wayward ship home to Rio de Janeiro, arriving on the 21st.|$|E
5|$|Hessen {{participated in}} fleet {{maneuvers}} in February 1908 in the Baltic Sea and more fleet training off Helgoland in May–June. In July, Hessen {{and the rest}} of the fleet sailed into the Atlantic Ocean to conduct a major training cruise. Prince Heinrich had pressed for such a cruise the previous year, arguing that it would prepare the fleet for overseas operations and would break up the monotony of training in German waters, though tensions with Britain over the developing Anglo-German naval arms race were high. The fleet departed Kiel on 17 July, passed through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal to the North Sea, and continued on to the Atlantic. During the cruise, Hessen stopped <b>at</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz</b> de Tenerife in the Canary Islands. The fleet returned to Germany on 13 August. The autumn maneuvers followed from 27 August to 12 September. Later that year, the fleet toured coastal German cities as part of an effort to increase public support for naval expenditures. The next year—1909—followed much the same pattern as in 1908. Another cruise into the Atlantic was conducted from 7 July to 1 August, during which Hessen stopped in El Ferrol, Spain. While on the way back to Germany, the High Seas Fleet was received by the British Royal Navy in Spithead. Late in the year, Admiral Henning von Holtzendorff became the commander of the High Seas Fleet. His tenure as fleet commander was marked with strategic experimentation, owing to the increased threat the latest underwater weapons posed and the fact that the new s were too wide to pass through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. Accordingly, the fleet was transferred from Kiel to Wilhelmshaven on 1 April 1910.|$|E

25|$|Several factors {{contribute}} to the development of relatively large sea caves. The nature of the zone of weakness itself is surely a factor, although difficult to quantify. A more readily observed factor is the situation of the cave’s entrance relative to prevailing sea conditions. <b>At</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz</b> Island, the largest caves face into the prevailing northwest swell conditions—a factor which also makes them more difficult to survey. Caves in well-protected bays sheltered from prevailing seas and winds tend to be smaller, as are caves in areas where the seas tend to be calmer.|$|E
25|$|California Powder Works began {{producing}} {{smokeless powder}} for firearms ammunition {{in the early}} 1890s. Peyton Powder, prepared <b>at</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz</b> {{under the direction of}} assistant superintendent William Peyton, had an unusual addition of ammonium picrate to the conventional double-base formulation of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. Peyton Powder was selected by the United States Army in 1893 for early cartridges for the new Krag-Jørgensen service rifle. The powder works also produced CPW Smokeless powder and loaded shotgun ammunition marketed as Native Son Cartridges after the army adopted W.A. powder in 1896 to avoid cartridge case corrosion caused by picric acid in the Peyton Powder.|$|E
25|$|California Powder Works {{manufactured}} powder for naval artillery. Initial {{production was}} prismatic brown powder, and the works later obtained {{a license to}} produce The United States Navy's patented nitrocellulose smokeless powder. Both powders were used by the Pacific and Asiatic Fleets, and for Pacific harbor and coast defense. The powder works operated a proving ground <b>at</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz</b> beginning 1892 using guns provided by the United States Inspector of Ordnance. Individual powder lots were test fired in the guns {{for which they were}} intended, including a 57mm QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss, a 6"/45 caliber Quick-Fire Rifle Model 1897, and an 8"/32 caliber Breech-Loading Rifle Model 1888.|$|E

25|$|Building upon Himalayan Kumoan {{tradition}} of centuries old yoga development, Baba Hari Dass started his weekly Yoga Sutras of Patanjali {{classes at the}} University of California, <b>at</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz,</b> CA in 1975. Several commentaries and yoga classics were referenced, such as: Yoga Vashishta, Hatha Yoga Pradipika, Shiva Samhita, Goraksha Samhita,Yoga Bhashya attributed to Veda Vyasa (probably the fifth C.E.); Īśvarakrishna's Samkhyakarika (4th or 5th century CE); Vācaspati Miśra's Tattvavaiśāradī (the ninth century C.E.); Yogavartika of Vijnanabhiksu (the sixteenth century C.E.); Swami Hariharananda Aranya's (1869–1947) Yoga Philosophy of Patanjali, and Pandit Usharbudh Arya's commentary (1986). In his exposition of the yoga principles, continued until 2012, the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali and Ashtanga Yoga played a fundamental and formative role in educating yoga seekers.|$|E
25|$|The Canary Islands {{have low}} levels of air {{pollution}} thanks {{to the lack of}} factories and industry and the tradewinds which naturally move away contaminated air from the islands. According to official data offered by the Health and Industry Ministry in Spain, Tenerife is one of the cleanest places in the country with an air pollution index below the national average. Despite this, there are still agents which affect pollution levels in the island, the main polluting agents being the refinery <b>at</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz,</b> the thermal power plants at Las Caletillas and Granadilla, and road traffic, increased by the high level of tourism in the island. In addition on the island of Tenerife like on La Palma light pollution must be also controlled, to help the astrophysical observatories located in the island's summits.|$|E
25|$|When {{dynamite}} {{was invented}} in 1867 and quickly became popular, a new dynamite plant was opened in 1869 near San Francisco in the area which later became Golden Gate Park. The danger of accidental explosions near a population center became unacceptable as San Francisco expanded; and land was purchased on Point Pinole in 1879 to shift manufacturing to {{the east side of}} San Francisco Bay. After initial purchases in 1868, DuPont had obtained 43% interest in California Powder Works by 1876, and financed Hercules Powder Company with Laflin & Rand Powder Company in 1882. The city of Hercules was named after California Powder Works' blasting powder, known as Hercules Powder, which in turn was named for the powerful Greek demigod, Hercules. Guncotton and nitroglycerine manufactured at Hercules were shipped to the smokeless powder plant <b>at</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1789, <b>at</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz</b> de Nuca, a {{conflict}} occurred between the Spanish naval officer Esteban José Martínez and the British merchant James Colnett, triggering the Nootka Crisis, which grew {{into an international}} incident {{and the threat of}} war between Britain and Spain. The first Nootka Convention averted the war but left many specific issues unresolved. Both sides sought to define a northern boundary for New Spain. At Nootka Sound, the diplomatic representative of New Spain, Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra, proposed a boundary at the Strait of Juan de Fuca, but the British representative, George Vancouver refused to accept any boundary north of San Francisco. No agreement could be reached and the northern boundary of New Spain remained unspecified until the Adams–Onís Treaty with the United States (1819). That treaty also ceded Spanish Florida to the United States.|$|E
25|$|Religious {{services}} <b>at</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz</b> {{became the}} prerogative of the vicar as of 17 May 1832, and on 21 December 1836, {{there was a}} decree to transfer the possessions of the Church to the Junta de Paróquia (ecclesiastical parish authority). A year later (on 18 September) the Junta gave the municipal administration the bill for repairs {{to the church and}} construction of the baptistery. Construction and remodelling of the frontispiece and tower was undertaken in 1844, while the altar of Bom Jesus was redone, and substituted by that of São José. A decade later, the wife of majorat Ildefonso Clímaco Raposo Bicudo Correia donated 200$000 to construct a stand for Senhor dos Passos, but a majority was actually deposited in the coffers of the Junta de Paróquia (20 August 1854), and the moneies were only despensed on 17 June 1855.|$|E
25|$|California Powder Works {{became a}} DuPont {{subsidiary}} in 1903, and operated under the DuPont name after 1906. Powder works wharf demolition begun in 1883 was completed before {{construction of the}} Neptune Casino at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk in 1904. DuPont control of explosives manufacturing in the United States caused federal anti-trust action in 1912 requiring DuPont to distribute assets into three firms. Manufacture of blasting explosives was assigned to Atlas Powder Company. California Powder Works double-base smokeless powder patents were assigned to Hercules Powder Company's consolidated smokeless powder manufacturing facility at Kenvil, New Jersey. DuPont retained manufacture of black powder and single base smokeless powders including the powder being manufactured for the United States Navy. When the Panama Canal simplified transport to the Pacific Fleet, DuPont consolidated production facilities in New Jersey and terminated operations <b>at</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz</b> in 1914. Powder mill facilities were dismantled, and the property was sold in 1924. The two mansions occupied by powder works superintendents were abandoned and razed in the 1930s.|$|E

500|$|In 1847 {{and the two}} {{following}} years, PedroII and {{his family}} spent the summer at Petrópolis. The traditional summer residence of the imperial family was <b>at</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz</b> Estate, a rural property {{that had belonged to}} the Braganzas for generations. The shift to Petrópolis seemed an unwelcome novelty among members of the court, [...] "who disliked any change that threatened the established ways and interests". Bowing to tradition, the Emperor decided to again summer <b>at</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz</b> in 1850. During the imperial family's stay at the rural estate, Pedro Afonso and his sister Isabel were struck by fever. The princess eventually recovered, but the Prince Imperial died of convulsions at 04:20 on 10 January. Contemporaries argued that either encephalitis or a congenital disorder may have caused his death.|$|E
500|$|In England, Wenger {{has used}} his {{extensive}} {{knowledge of the}} European transfer market and rulings – particularly in his native France – to recruit players. His first purchase as Arsenal manager was Anelka from Paris Saint-Germain for £500,000, a deal which upset the French club as they received little remuneration. The player's subsequent sale to Real Madrid just two years later for £23.5million highlighted Wenger's shrewdness in the transfer market. He remained in contact with Guillou's Abidjan-based academy, where he discovered future Arsenal players Touré and Emmanuel Eboué, and successfully persuaded Fàbregas and Hector Bellerín, amongst other La Masia graduates, to leave Barcelona and join him. Wenger's recruitment of young players came under criticism from Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, who disputed it was tantamount to child trafficking. Wenger refuted the analogy and said: [...] "Look <b>at</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz</b> at Blackburn. Ask him what age he came to Bayern Munich. Then you {{have an answer for}} Rummenigge." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{source of}} {{criticism}} by the Liberals involved PedroI's abolitionist views. The Emperor had indeed conceived a gradual process for eliminating slavery. However, the constitutional power to enact legislation {{was in the}} hands of the Assembly, which was dominated by slave-owning landholders who could thus thwart any attempt at abolition. The Emperor opted to try persuasion by moral example, setting up his estate <b>at</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz</b> as a model by granting land to his freed slaves there. PedroI also professed other advanced ideas. When he declared his intention to remain in Brazil on 9 January 1822 and the populace sought to accord him the honor of unhitching the horses and pulling his carriage themselves, the then-Prince Regent refused. His reply was a simultaneous denunciation of the divine right of kings, of nobility's supposedly superior blood and of racism: [...] "It grieves me to see my fellow humans giving a man tributes appropriate for the divinity, I know that my blood is the same color as that of the Negroes." ...|$|E
