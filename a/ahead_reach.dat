Still, after a bite of food, he climbed up into the driving-seat of the big gang-plough. Summer is short in the Northwest, and the wheat that goes in late runs a risk of freezing, so he needed in his struggle the efforts of every man he could get. He drove the threefold furrow through the ripping sod until at last the copper sun dipped below the prairie's verge. Then, leaving his team to the men, {{he went back to}} the house, too weary to carry himself erect. The birches swayed in a cold green transparency, the crisp air had vim in it, but the weary man noticed nothing as he plodded, heavy-eyed, through the crackling stubble.|$|R

40|$|Indeterminate {{neoplasms}} (IN) {{represent the}} gray zone of thyroid cytology in which malignant and benign tumors cannot be discriminated. Recently, the approach by thin core needle biopsy has been proposed. Here we report a new thin core needle biopsy approach in 40 consecutive patients with thyroid IN at cytology. In this study, a 21 -G needle was {{inserted into the}} nodule, advanced within the lesion, and moved <b>ahead</b> <b>reaching</b> extranodular tissue. The resulting sample allowed to evaluate the cytomorphology of nodular tissue, its relationship with extranodular parenchyma, and the nodule's capsule when present. All biopsies were adequate for diagnosis but one. Of the 39 adequate samples, 5 cases were papillary cancer as confirmed at histology, while 14 nodules avoided surgery because of Hurthle cell hyperplasia in thyroiditis (n = 6) and microfollicular adenomatous hyperplasia (n = 8). The remaining 20 cases were assessed as follicular neoplasms because of encapsulation and were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Of these, 6 had positive markers in different degree and 1 / 6 has follicular cancer at histology, while the other 14 were benign after surgery. Overall, this approach by thin core needle biopsy identified benignancy in 14 / 40 (35 %) IN avoiding surgery. As a conclusion, thin core biopsy should help to discern the nature of thyroid lesions cytologically classified as indeterminate, {{and it should be}} used as a complementary test in thyroid nodule assessment...|$|R
40|$|The {{information}} content of broad money M 3 for future GDP inflation in the euro area is investigated {{from a number}} of perspectives. Firstly, tests that money does not Granger-cause prices are conducted within a cointegrated VAR system comprising real M 3 holdings, real GDP, inflation and short- and long-term interest rates. Secondly, this empirical framework is extended to investigate the claim that - {{in the context of an}} extended P-star model - the real money gap has substantial predictive power for future inflation. And thirdly, the P-star type of model developed is compared with an existing rival model of inflation in the euro area where no explicit role is given to monetary developments. Our empirical results confirm that a significant positive association exists between the real money gap and future inflation up to five to six quarters <b>ahead,</b> <b>reaching</b> a maximum at the three-to-four quarter horizon. It is also shown that, although the extended P-star model outperforms the competing model in terms of out-of-sample forecast accuracy (as measured by the root mean square forecast errors) at horizons above two quarters, the hypothesis that no useful information is contained in rival evidence can be rejected at standard confidence levels.
