They first met when Møller was teaching at the University of Copenhagen and they also lived in the same square in Copenhagen from 1836 to 1838. Møller was also well acquainted with Søren's brother Peter. Six years after Møller's death, Kierkegaard dedicated his work The Concept of Anxiety to him with remarks which were unusually personal for Kierkegaard. An unpublished draft of the dedication was even more emphatic, referring to Møller as the [...] "inspiration of my youth" [...] and [...] "the mighty trumpet of my awakening".

30|$|In a {{previous}} investigation of Connectivism (AlDahdouh, 2017; AlDahdouh et al., 2015), {{it was shown}} that Connectivism lacks a clear explanation of how a connection is formed.

In addition, Clarà and Barberà (2014), who identified three problems with connectivist conception of learning, questioned “When a pattern is connected for the first time, why are the nodes connected in that specific way, <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> configuration seen as a pattern?” (p. 12).

Among architects and designers nothing else can be worse than having your work reviewed as “plastic”, {{which is also a}} term for “tacky ” and “fake”. <b>And</b> <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>that?</b> Maybe because the material plastic is considered to be {{a material}} for limited use and then thrown away? Maybe because plastic is a man-made material, i. e. an artificial substance? It is interesting that so many materials that are considered as real are imitated using plastic as material. A posh “marble ” bar, “oak ” parquet floor and “terracot-ta ” pots. Not to mention the plastic flowers, all are examples of how we imitate nature with plastic. Technically, plastic is a generic term for materials that blend polymers and other additives, based on mineral oil which is a limited resource. So as the oil wells are being emptied the mountains of waste are growing, it becomes increasingly important that we start to re-use our plastic waste. Recycled plastic is fortunately something that is becoming more and more common, in order to reduce environmental impact, reduce our dependency of oil and to re-use a very versatile raw material. The plastic is all around us; from your toothbrush to the steering wheel in your car. Either you like it or not, the plastic is here to stay. One fact remains; the plastic is cheap. The plastic is easy to handle and can be molded and shaped in infinite array of shapes. The plastic melts at relatively low temperature compared to competing materials like metal, thus easy to recycle. The plastic protects against rain and wind and is waterproof...|$|E
