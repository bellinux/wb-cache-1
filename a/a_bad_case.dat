5|$|A {{few years}} after {{settling}} down in Berlin, Accum had a house built at 16 Marienstraße (later 21 Marienstraße), where he dwelt until his death. During his last years, he suffered from <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>case</b> of gout, which ultimately led to his death. His illness took a serious {{turn for the worse}} in June 1838, and he rapidly deteriorated. On June 28, approximately 16 years after he return to Germany, Accum {{died at the age of}} 69 in Berlin. He was buried there at the Dorotheenstädtischen Friedhof.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Yamaha {{introduced}} a new square-four cylinder bike, similar to Suzuki's RG500. Roberts raced to a second-place finish behind Marco Luchinelli at the non-championship Imola 200 race. Roberts' bike had a suspension failure in the Grand Prix season opener at Austria, but he rebounded to win the next two races in Germany and Italy. Roberts' title hopes suffered a setback at the Dutch TT at Assen when his Yamaha's front brake pads were installed incorrectly causing his front wheel to lock up on the starting line, ending his race before it had started. He came back to score a second place behind Lucchinelli in Belgium, but was once again struck by misfortune when <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>case</b> of food poisoning forced him to miss the San Marino Grand Prix. He then narrowly lost the British Grand Prix to Jack Middelburg by three-tenths of a second before ending his season with a seventh place in Finland and a retirement in Sweden. Suzuki team riders Mamola and Lucchinelli battled to the final race of the season before the Italian claimed the championship {{with a total of}} five Grand Prix victories, with Mamola finishing in second and Roberts in third place.|$|E
25|$|The {{most direct}} {{competitor}} of quicksort is heapsort. Heapsort's running time is , but heapsort's average running time is usually considered slower than in-place quicksort. This result is debatable; some publications indicate the opposite. Introsort is {{a variant of}} quicksort that switches to heapsort when <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>case</b> is detected to avoid quicksort's worst-case running time.|$|E

25|$|In September 2001, Joe Sillett {{was hunting}} {{in his garage}} for a bat ahead of a Sunday match for his club side Brook in Surrey versus The Zombies. The only one he could find had <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>case</b> of woodworm, and to repair the damage, Joe's father Bob carved out small curves towards {{the top of the}} bat, {{finishing}} it by hand and a Black and Decker power sander. In the match, using his oddly shaped bat, he scored 142 not out, and it was at that point Joe decided to found The Woodworm Cricket Company, with its now famous shaped bats.|$|E
2500|$|John Preston also {{reviewed}} the first episode, {{and said that}} although it showed flashes of brilliance, it had an [...] "infuriating glibness too as the web of connectedness became ever more stretched.

There wasn’t any – or nothing like enough of it to prevent <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>case</b> of mental indigestion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the course}} of Game 2 of the 1992 ALCS, Jim Kaat was {{stricken}} with <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>case</b> of laryngitis. As a result, Johnny Bench had to come over from the CBS Radio booth and finish the game with Dick Stockton as a [...] "relief analyst." [...] There was talk that if Kaat's laryngitis did not get better, Don Drysdale was going to replace Kaat on television for Game 3, while Bench would {{continue to work on}} CBS Radio.|$|E

6000|$|... "It's <b>a</b> pretty <b>bad</b> <b>case.</b> The boy seems {{run down}} every way. No, it is {{impossible}} to think of moving him again. Bringing him here last night did him a great deal of harm. Yes, you may see him, but he will not know you, I fear--he is delirious and raves of his father and California." ...|$|R
2500|$|Dr. Bridges was {{the next}} {{prosecution}} witness, repeating his earlier testimony. On cross examination, Bridges testified detecting no movement in the spermatozoa found in either woman, suggesting intercourse had taken place some time before. He also testified that defendant Willie Roberson was [...] "diseased with syphilis and gonorrhea, <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>case</b> of it." [...] He admitted under questioning that Price {{told him that she}} had had sex with her husband and that Bates had earlier had intercourse as well, before the alleged rape events.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 September 2014, Funeral for a Friend debuted {{the lead}} single from their {{forthcoming}} album Chapter and Verse, titled [...] "You've Got <b>a</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>Case</b> of the Religions" [...] on the Rock Show on BBC Radio 1. The band then announced the album's release date of January 19, 2015 {{as well as}} a UK/European Tour in support of the album. Chapter and Verse was recorded in just under two weeks, at The Ranch, Southampton; the record was produced by Lewis Johns. Prior to the album's release, music videos were released for both [...] "1%" [...] and [...] "Pencil Pusher". In June, they released Hours - Live at Islington Academy, a live DVD of their show at O2 Academy Islington in April 2014 where they played Hours in full. The DVD also came with a CD or vinyl record of the show. Also around this time, they recorded a cover of [...] "I Can Climb Mountains" [...] by Hell Is For Heroes for Worship and Tributes, a compilation CD included with Rock Sound magazine's 200th issue, which ended up being the band's final recording. They were the only band who recorded a cover for the compilation who had one of their own songs covered on the same compilation, with Pop Punk band Neck Deep covering [...] "Juneau".|$|E

50|$|The first Baptists {{appeared}} in Bryn in 1848, services {{were held in}} a barn belonging to the colliery company, probably near Coalyard Row. It had 40 members and 40 in Sunday school. There was <b>a</b> very <b>bad</b> <b>case</b> of Cholera in 1849, and a surge in religious activity helped to establish a Baptist Chapel. This was the second chapel in Bryn. Built in 1858 with seating for 120 downstairs and 80 upstairs, the chapel had a boost of 45 members in 1859-60.|$|R

40|$|In this 'Open Letter' {{the author}} raises {{a number of}} {{concerns}} {{about the role of}} critique in feminist writing. She does this by exploring an article that represents, for her, <b>a</b> particularly <b>bad</b> <b>case</b> of the lack of generosity that can arise in the treatment of another's work. The author argues that, to develop greater generosity in our critical engagement with each other's work, we should make greater use of our reflexive imaginations in order to take fuller account of the conditions of a text's production...|$|R

Come into my dining-room, Mr. Robarts, where we shall be alone. Yes;--it is <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> case; <b>a</b> very <b>bad</b> <b>case.</b> The pity is that anybody should ever have said {{anything}} about it.

In justice to her you ought to know it. They have made her suffer. I haven't seen her alone, but only before them! We had an interview yesterday morning. They came out, flat, in so many words. They told me to go about my business. It seems to me <b>a</b> very <b>bad</b> <b>case.</b> I'm angry, I'm sore, I'm sick." ...|$|R

50|$|Ben-Haim {{argues that}} info-gap's {{robustness}} model is not min-max/maximin analysis {{because it is}} not worst case analysis of outcomes; it is a satisficing model, not an optimization model - a (straightforward) maximin analysis would consider worst-case outcomes over the entire space which, since uncertainty is often potentially unbounded, would yield <b>an</b> unbounded <b>bad</b> worst <b>case.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A crown graph (a {{complete}} {{bipartite graph}} , with {{the edges of}} a perfect matching removed) is <b>a</b> particularly <b>bad</b> <b>case</b> for greedy coloring: if the vertex ordering places two vertices consecutively whenever they belong {{to one of the}} pairs of the removed matching, then a greedy coloring will use [...] colors, while the optimal number of colors for this graph is two. There also exist graphs such that with high probability a randomly chosen vertex ordering leads to a number of colors much larger than the minimum. Therefore, it is of some importance in greedy coloring to choose the vertex ordering carefully. The number of colors produced by the greedy coloring for the worst ordering of a given graph is called its Grundy number.|$|R

5000|$|Although Vyvyan is {{constantly}} unruly, he does possess a compassionate side; {{primarily in the}} episode [...] "Cash", when {{he thought he was}} pregnant he was considering names to call his baby and he also patted his [...] "bump" [...] saying [...] "that's my boy!" [...] when it hit Rick in the face and knocked him into the fireplace. Also when Vyvyan began having [...] "contractions" [...] he appealed to the other housemates for help, this led to Neil getting a job in the police force (it was later revealed that he just had <b>a</b> really <b>bad</b> <b>case</b> of built-up gas). On another occasion, in the last episode [...] "Summer Holiday" [...] Vyvyan dissolved into tears because he crashed his car and also because it caused SPG's death while he was asleep on the car's radiator.|$|R
5000|$|Toronto lawyer Jonathan Rosenthal, however, stated: [...] "It's <b>a</b> very <b>bad</b> <b>case</b> for the victims' rights {{movement}} to be {{jumping up and}} screaming about. It's atypical: This is a case where, bottom line, the complainants all lied." [...] The case was also atypical in that the police solicited victims to come forward, and some were very active with media interviews (DeCoutere conducted 19 herself) which was used against them in cross examination. The complainants were also in an environment with supporters saying victims must be believed. This perceived solidarity led {{to two of the}} complainants exchanging more than 5,000 messages before the trial. The potential for this to be seen as collusion led to the Crown abandoning an application to make [...] "similar fact" [...] case which tied the three complaints together.|$|R
