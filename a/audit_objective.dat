40|$|This {{dissertation}} examined auditors 2 ̆ 7 knowledge {{structures of}} financial statement errors. Two different experiments involving data sorting exercises and reaction time tests were conducted. In the sorting experiment, auditors {{were asked to}} sort financial statement errors as they thought the errors should go together. In the reaction time experiment, auditors {{were asked to identify}} financial statement errors after being first prompted with either an <b>audit</b> <b>objective</b> or a transaction cycle cue. All subjects participated in both experiments in order to strengthen the case for determining whether the knowledge structure exhibited varies depending on the methodology used. ^ There were three primary findings. First, the sorting methodology results provided support for the theory that the dominant knowledge structure utilized by experienced auditors is an <b>audit</b> <b>objective</b> structure. This result was consistent with other studies using a sorting methodology. Conversely, the second finding was that experienced auditors exhibited a transaction cycle structure when tested under the reaction time method. The third finding was that both experienced and novice auditors were more accurate in identifying financial statement errors after being prompted with transaction cycle cues than after being prompted with <b>audit</b> <b>objective</b> cues. ^ There are two primary contributions of this dissertation. First, it provides support for the theory that the more dominant knowledge structure of experienced auditors is the transaction cycle structure. This is an important contribution because a series of audit training recommendations and assumptions regarding accounting research have been made {{based on the assumption that}} experienced auditors have <b>audit</b> <b>objective</b> dominant knowledge structures. Consequently, these findings may lead to a reconsideration of these recommendations and assumptions and also prompt future researchers to reexamine this issue. ^ This dissertation also demonstrates that the reaction time method is a methodology well-suited for studying issues in accounting and auditing domains. The fact that the reaction time method found different results than the sorting experiments related to an issue that was considered “resolved” may lead to further use of this and other new methodologies. The use of new and innovative research techniques could also possibly improve the quality of future accounting research. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} if {{to determine}} whether the Department of Energy (Department) was adequately managing its nuclear materials provided to domestic licensees. The audit was performed from February 2007 to September 2008 at Department Headquarters in Washington, DC, and Germantown, MD; the Oak Ridge Office and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, TN. In addition, we visited or obtained data from 40 different non-Departmental facilities in various states. To accomplish the <b>audit</b> <b>objective,</b> we: (1) Reviewed Departmental and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requirements for the control and accountability of nuclear materials; (2) Analyzed a Nuclear Materials Management and Safeguards System (NMMSS) report with ending inventory balances for Department-owned nuclear materials dated September 30, 2007, to determine the amount and types of nuclear materials located at non-Department domestic facilities; (3) Held discussions with Department and NRC personnel that used NMMSS information to determine their roles and responsibilities related to the control and accountability over nuclear materials; (4) Selected a judgmental sample of 40 non-Department domestic facilities; (5) Met with licensee officials and sent confirmations {{to determine whether}} their actual inventories of Department-owned nuclear materials were consistent with inventories reported in the NMMSS; and, (6) Analyzed historical information related to the 2004 NMMSS inventory rebaselining initiative to determine the quantity of Department-owned nuclear materials that were written off from the domestic licensees inventory balances. This performance audit was conducted in accordance with generally accepted Government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our <b>audit</b> <b>objective.</b> We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. The audit included tests of controls and compliance with laws and regulations related to managing the Department-owned nuclear materials provided to non-Departmental domestic licensees. Because our review was limited it would not necessarily have disclosed all internal control deficiencies that may have existed at the time of our audit. We examined the establishment of performance measures in accordance with Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, as they related to the <b>audit</b> <b>objective.</b> We found that the Department had established performance measures related to removing or disposing of nuclear materials and radiological sources around the world. We utilized computer generated data during our audit and performed procedures to validate the reliability of the information as necessary to satisfy our <b>audit</b> <b>objective.</b> As noted in the report, we questioned the reliability of the NMMSS data...|$|E

To form a conclusion against the <b>audit</b> <b>objective,</b> the ANAO adopted the following high-level audit criteria: 	Health and Human Services have effective governance and administrative arrangements to support the delivery of the Child Dental Benefits Schedule; 	Human Services has implemented systems and processes to administer payments to eligible clients in an accurate and timely manner; and 	Health and Human Services effectively monitor, evaluate and report on compliance and performance to inform delivery of the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. Conclusion Health and Human Services’ day-to-day administration of the Child Dental Benefits Schedule has been largely effective. The ANAO identified scope for improvement in relation to Health’s risk management planning for the program and Human Services’ quality framework for the manual data matching process used to maintain the integrity of program data. The policy design of the program has addressed some of the shortcomings of the previous Medicare Teen Dental Plan. In common with the previous program, the CDBS continues to attract relatively low customer uptake—around 30  per cent in the 2014 and 2015 calendar years—as compared to Health’s projections, resulting in a significant underspend of allocated funding. In the context of low program uptake, there should be a focus on improved communication with the target population and review activity to inform advice to government on the progress and future directions of the CDBS. The program’s second year of operation ends in December 2015 and is an appropriate point for Health to take stock...|$|E

40|$|<b>Audit</b> <b>objective</b> and {{criteria}} The {{objective of the}} audit {{was to assess the}} establishment and administration of the Australian Border Force’s framework to ensure the lawful exercise of powers in accordance with applicable legislation. To form a conclusion against the <b>audit</b> <b>objective,</b> the ANAO adopted the following high-level audit criteria: 	Is there an effective accountability and reporting framework for the lawful exercise of powers? 	Do Border Force officers have adequate knowledge of their powers and how to use them? Conclusion As part of the integration of Immigration and Customs, the department has made progress towards establishing a framework to ensure Border Force officers exercise coercive powers lawfully and appropriately. However, significantly more work {{needs to be done to}} gain assurance that controls are effective. The department’s enterprise risk management framework does not adequately address the risk of officers exercising coercive powers unlawfully or inappropriately. Several internal assurance reviews have uncovered problems relating to the exercise of statutory powers. The Border Force has established an integrated operational quality assurance team, which has not yet finalised any reports. Delegations and authorisations for coercive powers are complete and in place but not all instruments are accessible to officers. The ANAO found instances of potentially unlawful searches and failure to comply with instructions under both the Customs Act and Migration Act, which indicate current internal controls for mitigating the risk of unlawful or inappropriate use of coercive powers are inadequate. The department has not provided adequate instructions and guidance for officers exercising coercive powers. There is currently no single source of instructions and guidance material for Border Force officers, and much of the guidance material available is out of date and inaccurate. While positive foundational work has commenced on integrating the former Customs and Immigration training regimes, officers have been exercising significant coercive powers without having undertaken pre-requisite training...|$|E
