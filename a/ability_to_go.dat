5|$|Alien: Isolation is a single-player action-adventure {{game with}} heavy {{emphasis}} on stealth and survival horror features. The player controls the protagonist, Amanda Ripley, from a first-person perspective {{to interact with the}} environment. To advance through the game, the player must explore a space station and complete numerous objectives while avoiding, outsmarting and defeating enemies. Objectives range from activating computers to collecting certain items or reaching a specific area in the game. The player has the ability to run, climb ladders, and sneak into vents. The player can also crouch and hide behind objects to break the line of sight with enemies, and covertly peek over or lean around to gain view. The player also has the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> under nearby tables or inside lockers to hide from enemies.|$|E
5|$|Yuu's {{younger sister}} Ayumi {{eventually}} awakens {{an ability to}} cause anything around her to suddenly collapse, which results in her death. Yuu falls into a deep depression as a result and isolates himself, but Nao successfully manages to pull {{him out of his}} depression and gets him to return to the student council. While attending a concert of the post-rock band Zhiend with Nao, Yuu recollects previously suppressed memories of his brother Shunsuke, who has the ability to time travel. Shunsuke had used this ability to establish Hoshinoumi Academy and an affiliated organization attempting to develop a vaccine to prevent children from developing abilities before they manifest, but repeated use leaves him blind. Yuu learns that the true nature of his ability enables him to steal someone's ability by possessing them. Yuu steals Shunsuke's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back in time and ultimately prevent Ayumi's death by stealing her collapse ability before she can use it.|$|E

50|$|Students at Vaganova-based pre-professional {{schools are}} {{expected}} to also take courses in choreography and pedagogy. These two subjects allow students of all <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on <b>to</b> become both choreographers and well trained teachers. Frequently, {{students who do not}} pass exams for their grade in ballet are redirected into training as choreographers and teachers. This is unique to Vaganova training, as other schools focus solely on a future in dancing.|$|R

25|$|Prior to 1922, Woodhaven Boulevard was {{the only}} {{important}} north-south street in town. However, it ended at Liberty Avenue. Then officials decided to expand Woodhaven Boulevard all the way south to the Rockaways and finally opened it to traffic in 1925. This made Ozone Park more accessible by both bus and car. Since cars were also becoming more popular at that time, the land became much more valuable, leading to a construction boom {{in an attempt to}} fill any empty lot. Between 1921 and 1930, Ozone Park saw a population increase of over 180% from 40,000 to 112,950 people. With this extraordinary increase in population came the need for schools and sources of entertainment. In response to this demand came the construction of John Adams High School in 1930. This school was built just as the construction boom slowed down and right before the Great Depression. Furthermore, in 1925 the development of the Cross-Bay Movie Theatre gave residents the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and see a show while also connecting with neighbors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Cognitive theorists {{describe}} mindfulness {{as a form}} of attention-awareness {{in which}} thoughts can be observed in non-judging, de-centered, and non-attached ways. However, empirical research has not examined associations between mindfulness and responses to negative automatic thoughts, such as the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> let <b>go</b> of negative cognition. In the first study reported in this article, measures of dispositional mindfulness were negatively correlated with negative thought frequency and percep-tions of the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> let <b>go</b> of negative thoughts in an unselected student sample. In the second study reported, these associations were replicated in a treatment-seeking student sample, where participation in a mindfulness meditation-based clinical intervention was shown to be associated with decreases in both frequency and perceptions of difficulty in letting-go of negative automatic thoughts. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed...|$|R

She awakens and finds herself in an area called Limbo, a place between Heaven and Hell. The receptionist reveals to her that she has died, and she must find her caseworker for further instruction. A strict supervisor named Rogers comes along and reveals that when people die, if they had not performed good deeds on Earth, then they must perform community service as a mythological being with many, incredible magical <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Heaven by heading up the mystical Stairway to Heaven.

500|$|Sayers' {{ability as}} a runner in the open field was {{considered}} unmatched, both during his playing career and since his retirement. Although he possessed modest raw speed—he completed a 100-yard dash in 9.7 seconds—he was highly elusive and had terrific vision, a combination which made him very difficult to tackle. Actor Billy Dee Williams, who portrayed Sayers in the 1971 film Brian's Song, likened his running to [...] "ballet" [...] and [...] "poetry". Mike Ditka, a teammate of Sayers' for two seasons, called him [...] "the greatest player I've ever seen. That's right—the greatest." [...] Another former teammate, linebacker Dick Butkus, famous for his tackling ability, said of Sayers: He had this <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> full speed, cut and then go full speed again right away. I saw it every day in practice. We played live, and you could never get a clean shot on Gale. Never.|$|E
2500|$|However, Ketchum was persistent, spread {{information}} in various medical circles, and in October 1910 got written {{up in the}} press.

500|$|Final Fantasy Mystic Quest's soundtrack was {{composed}} by Ryuji Sasai and Yasuhiro Kawakami. It {{was one of}} the first games in the Final Fantasy series not to be composed by regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu, after Final Fantasy Adventure (known in Japan as Final Fantasy Gaiden) and the Final Fantasy Legend games (only called Final Fantasy games in North America). The album was first released on one Compact Disc by [...] NTT Publishing on September 10, 1993. ROM capacity limits and hardware limitations made the composition process difficult. After the game was completed, Sasai recorded two remixes on his days off for the game's album, and personally played the guitar parts. “Mountain Range of Whirlwinds” was built off of Sasai's liking of the sound of the french horn, and its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> the length of the song and convey a sense of mountains. The track [...] "Last Castle" [...] was written in a short time, and was used to create imagery of a field, but its length left very little space for the [...] "Battle 3" [...] song.' ...|$|E
500|$|Turbo-electric {{propulsion}} {{had been}} chosen for the battlecruisers because American companies struggled to produce the very large geared turbines necessary for such big ships and was retained when they were converted into aircraft carriers. One advantage of turbo-electric drive was that the substitution of flexible electric cables for bulky steam-lines allowed the motors to be mounted further to {{the stern of the}} ship; this reduced vibration and weight by shortening the propeller shafts. Another was the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> astern at full power without needing a separate reverse turbine to do so, simply by reversing the electrical polarity of the motors. Other benefits were the ability to operate all four propellers if one of the turbo generators failed, and the possibility of operating only some of the generators at low speed with suitably higher loading and greater efficiency. [...] " [...] was efficient, rugged and always reliable. But it was also heavy, intricate, and not easy to maintain and keep tuned up." [...] The machinery also required special ventilation measures to dissipate heat and to keep out any salt air. Even with this and elaborate insulation measures, protection from moisture or from flooding due to battle damage or other causes remained problematic and it posed the danger of high voltage to the crew if damaged.|$|E

On Earth, intelligence and mathematical <b>ability</b> seem <b>to</b> <b>go</b> hand in hand in all life-forms, as pointed out by Keith Devlin among others.

60|$|Nothing {{remained}} now, but, indeed, {{the greatest}} difficulty {{to get it}} into the water, it lying about one hundred yards from it. To remedy the first inconvenience, which was a rising hill between the boat and the creek, with wonderful pains and labour I dug into {{the bowels of the}} earth, and made a declivity. But when this was done, all the strength I had was as insufficient to remove it, as it was when I attempted to remove the boat. I then proceeded to measure the difference of ground, resolving to make a canal, in order to bring the water to the canoe, since I could not bring the canoe to the water. But as this seemed to be impracticable to myself alone, under the space of eleven or twelve years, it brought me into some sort of consideration: so that I concluded this also to be impossible, and the attempt altogether vain. I now saw, and not before, what stupidity it is to begin a work before we reckon its costs, or judge rightly our own <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through with its performance.|$|R
