The Soviets had broken off contact with him in February. Fuchs may have been subsequently tipped off by Kim Philby.

He also endowed <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> state’s medical school in Portland (later Oregon Health & Science University) and a scholarship at Willamette University in Salem. He endowed <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Presbyterian’s seminary in San Francisco in 1886. In Portland, he helped to establish River View Cemetery. In 1891, Ladd platted what became Ladd's Addition in what is now Southeast Portland. The addition has a criss-crossed street layout, and had parks, utilities and was annexed into Portland that year along with the rest of East Portland.|$|E
25|$|He wrote {{extensive}} {{critiques of}} Karl Marx's economics in the 1880s and 1890s, and several prominent Marxists—including Rudolf Hilferding—attended his seminar in 1905–06.

At Göttingen, he taught a variety of courses, mainly on the interface between mathematics and physics, such as mechanics and potential theory.|$|E
25|$|After 1850 Weierstrass {{suffered}} from {{a long period of}} illness, but was able to publish papers that brought him fame and distinction. The University of Königsberg conferred an honorary doctor's degree on him on 31 March 1854. In 1856 he took <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Gewerbeinstitut, which later became the Technical University of Berlin.

25|$|Satyendra Nath Bose, {{along with}} Saha, {{presented}} several papers in theoretical physics and pure mathematics from 1918 onwards. In 1924, {{while working as}} a Reader (Professor without <b>a</b> <b>chair)</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Physics Department of the University of Dhaka, Bose wrote a paper deriving Planck's quantum radiation law without any reference to classical physics by using a novel way of counting states with identical particles. This paper was seminal in creating the very important field of quantum statistics. Though not accepted at once for publication, he sent the article directly to Albert Einstein in Germany. Einstein, recognising the importance of the paper, translated it into German himself and submitted it on Bose's behalf to the prestigious Zeitschrift für Physik. As a result of this recognition, Bose was able to work for two years in European X-ray and crystallography laboratories, during which he worked with Louis de Broglie, Marie Curie, and Einstein.|$|E

25|$|That year, Terzaghi {{was finally}} {{fed up with}} MIT and its {{president}} and determined to return to Europe. He accepted <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Vienna Technische Hochshule {{in the winter of}} 1929. He married Ruth, who became his editor and collaborator as well. A short consulting trip to the Soviet Union before taking up his post horrified him, and he came to oppose the communist system there, as a regime exemplified by its brutality and chaos. Using Austria as his base, he traveled ceaselessly throughout Europe, consulting, lecturing and making new professional contacts and collaborations. His teaching workload was now relatively light so he continued his experimental investigations and became especially interested in the problems of the settling of foundations, and of grouting. He began writing the manuscript for a much updated and expanded version of Erdbaumechanik, now set for two volumes. However, the political turmoil in Austria began to interfere with his work, and in 1935, he decided to take a leave from Vienna from 1935 to 1936.|$|E
25|$|In spring 1960, Matsushima {{became a}} {{professor}} of Osaka University as successor to the chair of Shoda. His research took a somewhat different direction and he wrote a series of papers on cohomology of locally symmetric spaces, collaborating with Murakami. He went to the Institute for Advanced Study in September 1962 and returned to Osaka after one year. He jointly began to organize the United States-Japan Seminar in Differential Geometry, which was held in Kyoto in June 1965. After this, he went to France and spent the academic year 1965-66 as visiting professor at the University of Grenoble. He accepted <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana in September 1966. He continued to collaborate with Murakami. He introduced Matsushima's formula for the Betti numbers of quotients of symmetric spaces. In 1967, he became {{an editor of the}} Journal of Differential Geometry and remained on the editorial board {{for the rest of his}} life. After 14 years at Notre Dame, he returned to Japan in 1980. A conference was organized in his honor in May 1980 before he left Notre Dame.|$|E

2500|$|A {{more serious}} escape attempt {{happened}} in 1908 that left Deputy Warden Robinson dead and Warden Conley severely wounded. It was Conley's habit to hold {{what he called}} a [...] "warden's court" [...] each morning where inmates could air their grievances. At [...] tall and weighing roughly [...], Warden Frank Conley was an imposing man, and he considered himself more than a match for the men he maintained. What his physical bulk could not handle, the [...]41 caliber pistol he habitually carried would. He was shown just how vulnerable he was when, on the morning of 8 March, Deputy John A. Robinson admitted the men lined up to speak with the warden and was rushed by four men, W.A. Hayes, C.B. Young, Oram Stevens, and George Rock. Hayes managed to get past Robinson and burst into Conley's office, waving a knife and threatening the warden. Conley drew his pistol and fired twice, hitting Hayes in the ear. The remaining three inmates rushed in and Conley fired [...] again, hitting George Rock, who retreated from the office. [...] Hayes got back to his feet, and Conley shot him again and threw him into the hall after Rock. [...] Conley then went to help Robinson, who was on the ground under Rock. [...] Rock had already slashed the Deputy's throat and was stabbing him when Conley threw <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> assailant, who turned on Conley. [...] The warden fended the armed man off with the butt of his now empty pistol, and the escape attempt was ended {{at the end of a}} billy-club wielded by Guard E.H. Carver, who had had to break through the locked door to the hallway.|$|E
2500|$|... “Although she {{was well}} over forty, she had lost none of her high spirits; she was kind and affectionate, but her {{eccentric}} and despotic nature made her rather formidable. When she heard that I {{was going to marry}} her niece, she took me in hand. From that day my life was no longer my own. She was an early riser and she used to telephone me at eight in the morning. Sometimes she came to the Hotel du Rhin, where I was staying, and sat reading the papers in my room while I dressed. If I happened to be out, she sent her servants all over Paris to look for me and sometimes took part in the search herself. I never had a moment's peace. I had to lunch, dine, go to the theater and supper with her almost every day. She usually slept through the first act of a play, and then woke up with a start to declare that the performance was stupid and that she wished to go somewhere else. We often changed theaters two or three times in one evening. As she felt the cold, she made her footman sit on <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door of her box, holding a small traveling bag filled with shawls, scarves and furs. All these objects were numbered. If by chance, she was awake and felt a draft, she would ask me to bring her such or such a number. I could have put up with all this but unfortunately she had a passion for dancing. At midnight, now wide awake, she would drag me to a night club where she danced till dawn.”The diplomat Maurice Paléologue wrote on 14 October 1913, [...] "Although she is fifty-three, she lives openly with an Argentinian blackguard, dances at Magic City with all comers till two in the morning and associates with the scum of the aerodromes." ...|$|E
