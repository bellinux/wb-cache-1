5|$|Almost all his {{seventeen}} San Francisco seasons {{concluded with}} Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Monteux's SFSO studio recordings were mainly {{made in the}} cavernous acoustics of War Memorial Opera House (without <b>an</b> <b>audience)</b> <b>with</b> the music transmitted over telephone wires to a Los Angeles studio and recorded on film there. Confined to the USA for {{the years of the}} Second World War, in 1942 Monteux took American citizenship.|$|E
5|$|Garrett Brock Trapnell hijacked a TWA {{airliner}} {{en route}} from Los Angeles to New York City in January.

After the aircraft landed at Kennedy Airport, he was shot and wounded by FBI agents, then arrested.|$|E
5|$|One {{issue with}} which ML Pin was deeply {{concerned}} {{was that of}} the country's teacher-training system, an issue he stressed during <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>with</b> King Ananda Mahidol after the war in 1946, and would later address during his term as Permanent Secretary of Education.|$|E

5|$|Armstrong's {{instructions}} for Portugal were to negotiate an expanded {{treaty with the}} government. They arrived at Santa Apolónia railway station in Lisbon on August 19. Kalākaua was presented with the Grand Cross Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Viçosa during <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>with</b> King Luís I at the Palace of Ajuda, and also attended a bullfight with Luis's father King Ferdinand II at the Pena Palace. When they left Portugal on August 24, Armstrong remained behind to initiate a treaty.|$|E
5|$|Despite his pro-slavery views, Dixon was {{loyal to}} the Union during the Civil War. He {{represented}} his county and his state {{in a number of}} failed conventions that sought to resolve the upcoming conflict before it began. In 1864, he joined Kentucky governor Thomas E. Bramlette in <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>with</b> President Abraham Lincoln protesting the recruitment of former slaves as Union soldiers in Kentucky. Dixon died on April 23, 1876.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the Civil War, Burnett sought <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>with</b> President Andrew Johnson, an old congressional colleague, but Johnson told him to go home. Burnett was indicted for treason at Louisville, but released on bond and never prosecuted. He partnered with Judge John R. Grace and resumed the practice of law in Cadiz. He died of cholera in Hopkinsville on September 28, 1866. Initially buried in the Old Cadiz Cemetery, he was moved to the East End Cemetery in Cadiz. His tombstone bears no mention of his Confederate service.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of his rule, Basiliscus showed his support for the Miaphysites. Zacharias Scholasticus reports how a group of Egyptian Miaphysite monks, having heard of Emperor Leo's death, had moved from Alexandria to Constantinople to petition Zeno in favour of Timothy, but at their arrival in the capital, they found the newly elected Basiliscus instead. The Magister Officiorum Theoctistus, the former physician of Basiliscus, was the brother of one of the monks, so the delegation obtained <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>with</b> Basiliscus, and, with the support of Theoctistus and of the Empress, they convinced Basiliscus to recall from exile the banished Miaphysite Patriarchs.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 Muller {{travelled}} to South Africa, {{where he}} visited Cape Town, the Orange Free State, and the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek. In Pretoria {{he attended the}} inauguration of President Kruger and in Bloemfontein he struck up a friendship with the newly elected President M.T. Steyn and his family. He also renewed his relations with other leading statesmen, like former President F.W. Reitz, government secretary P.J. Blignaut, {{and chairman of the}} Volksraad C.H. Wessels.

5|$|Muller's Asian {{trip was}} comprehensive. He visited British India and Ceylon, Burma, Malaysia and the Philippines and French Indochina, {{travelled}} extensively through the Dutch East Indies, and returned via Japan, Korea – {{where he had}} <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>with</b> the last Korean emperor –, Manchuria, China, and Siberia. Muller's visit to Japan triggered a lively interest {{in this country and}} its economic development potential. Back in the Netherlands he presented his views on the country in several speeches, brochures, and articles, mainly {{under the auspices of the}} Comité Nederland-Japan (Dutch-Japanese Committee).|$|E
5|$|Reaching Constantinople on 17 April, {{the party}} {{waited at the}} Pera Palace Hotel for three weeks while further travel {{arrangements}} were made. During this time, Pratap and Hentig met with Enver Pasha and enjoyed <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>with</b> the Sultan. On Enver Pasha's orders, a Turkish officer, Lieutenant Kasim Bey, was deputed to the expedition as the Turkish representative, bearing official letters addressed to the Afghan Emir and the Indian princely states. Two Afghans from the United States also joined the expedition.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Stowe's {{writings}} about Florida were duly noted by authorities. Her brother Charles purchased his own land upon her recommendation, not in Mandarin but in Newport near Tallahassee. During {{a visit to}} his home in 1874, she and a few Northern investors had <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>with</b> Governor Marcellus Stearns. They were met by his cabinet and staff {{on the steps of the}} state capitol building—which was festooned with greenery and a large welcome sign for the occasion—and they gave Stowe a round of loud and exuberant cheers.|$|E

5|$|The {{royal family}} {{had already left}} Vienna for the summer, but Kalākaua got to inspect the troops during {{military}} maneuvers at the Schmelz parade grounds. He later had <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>with</b> Archduke Albrecht, Duke of Teschen. In the evening, {{he returned to the}} opera house for a performance of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro. The next two days were spent sightseeing, including the Schönbrunn Palace, St. Stephen's Cathedral, the Votive Church, and the Neue Freie Presse.|$|E
5|$|Their time in Rome {{was a brief}} two days, {{during which}} Kalākaua, Armstrong, and Judd were granted <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>with</b> Pope Leo XIII on July 3. After {{receiving}} his blessing, they toured St. Peter's Basilica and other local tourist sites, and left the following day by train. The party traveled across France and Paris without informing the French authorities, which {{was seen as a}} breach of official protocol and had to be explained at a later date.|$|E
5|$|After {{the signing}} of the Treaty of Saigon, the Huế court {{attempted}} to regain what it had lost militarily through diplomacy. Vietnamese negotiators sought a reversal of the territorial cession, which they regarded as the most humiliating clause of the treaty. In late 1863, the Vietnamese proposed extensive financial, economic, and political concessions in exchange for the return of the three provinces. Tự Đức sent Gian to France to seek <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>with</b> Napoleon III. There Gian behaved in a helpless manner in an attempt to gain pity from the French monarch. Gian promised that Vietnam would pay large indemnities for the military conflicts, grant further commercial concessions and a protectorate over all six southern provinces. Napoleon initially agreed, but the decision was reversed after lobbying from French officers.|$|E

5|$|At {{the inaugural}} 12th Johor State Assembly Seating in April 2008, a minor {{controversy}} erupted when one opposition {{member of parliament}} (MP), Gwee Tong Hiang, flouted dress regulations by appearing in a lounge suit and tie {{instead of the usual}} official attire and songkok. This resulted in him being dismissed from the assembly chamber shortly before the Sultan's arrival. Gwee, a Democratic Action Party (DAP) MP, reportedly argued that there was no stated order to wear the official attire and songkok and stated his desire to wear a western suit, promptly drew flak from other MPs and the Menteri Besar, Abdul Ghani Othman who had earlier on met to agree to don in the official attire and songkok prior to the assembly, whereby Gwee was absent. The Sultan, apparently angry at Gwee, sharply criticised him two days later and publicly called upon Gwee to seek <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>with</b> him.|$|E
5|$|Bache {{had long}} {{cherished}} the wish of bringing Liszt to London, which Liszt had last visited in 1841 while still a touring virtuoso, and Liszt knew that whatever standing his music had {{in that city}} had {{in large part to}} do with Bache's efforts. At least in part to repay the debt he felt he owed Bache, Liszt accepted Bache's invitation to attend celebrations in April 1886 to commemorate Liszt's 75th birthday. These celebrations included the foundation of a Liszt piano scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music, a performance of his oratorio The Legend of Saint Elizabeth led by Alexander Mackenzie in St. James's Hall, <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>with</b> Queen Victoria and a public reception in Liszt's honour at the Grosvenor Gallery. Bache was involved in all four of these events, which were highly successful; by popular demand, Saint Elizabeth had to be repeated at the Crystal Palace.|$|E
5|$|Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, {{agreed to}} <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>with</b> the Electress Palatine in December 1711. He {{concluded}} that the Electress's succession brought no quandary, but added that he must succeed her. Cosimo and herself were abhorred by his reply. Realising how unforthcoming he had been, Charles wrote to Florence agreeing to the project, mentioning but one clause: the Tuscan state must not be bequeathed to the enemies of the House of Austria. At {{the culmination of the}} War of the Spanish Succession, at the Treaties of Utrecht and Rattstatt, Cosimo did not vie for international assurances for the Electress's succession. An inaction he would later grow to lament.|$|E
