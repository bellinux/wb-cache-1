5000|$|The {{area was}} {{recommended}} {{for a state}} park site by J.N. [...] "Ding" [...] Darling. The city of Indianola acquired the first 560 acre in 1934, and it was known initially as Indianola State Park. From 1934 to 1937 Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) Company 769 and a side camp built facilities in the park. They constructed the dam and reservoir from April 1934 to July 1935. However methods at the time did not consider long-term effects of the surrounding 3321 acre watershed. By the 1980s sedimentation had shrunk the reservoir by 11 acre and agricultural pollutants in surface runoff had reduced the water quality. Various government and community organizations began working with neighboring landowners to improve Lake Ahquabi. Widespread adoption of soil conservation practices by local farmers {{and the development of}} buffer wetlands and sedimentation basins have halved the amount of sediments and nutrients reaching the lake. In the mid-1990s the lake was extensively dredged, the shoreline stabilized, the dam improved, and an <b>aeration</b> <b>device</b> installed. Game fish like largemouth bass, bluegill, sunfish, channel catfish, and crappie were stocked. After restoration Lake Ahquabi State Park's annual visitation and fishing use each increased three-fold. Anglers have been catching an average of 2.7 fish per hour, twice the catch rate of most Iowa lakes.

40|$|Constructed {{wetlands}} {{are recognized}} as a reliable technology for rural wastewater treatment. However, conventional constructed wetlands face problems with low pollutant removal efficiency and limited oxygen transfer capability. Therefore, a novel vertical flow constructed wetland (VFCW) system with drop aeration was developed in this study. Two pilot-scale vertical flow constructed wetlands of 0. 75 m(2) each were constructed with the same dimensions and configuration but different media, one of which (named as CW(1)) {{was filled with a}} 1 : 1 mixture (by weight) of zeolite and dolomite and the other (named as CW(2)) with the same zeolite only. The oxygen transfer capability of a multilevel two-layer drop <b>aeration</b> <b>device,</b> organics and nitrogen removal of CW(1) and CW(2), and pollutant distribution along the depths of CW(1) and CW(2) in different operational phases were studied. The results demonstrated that compared with the direct drop aeration process, the multilevel, two-layer drop <b>aeration</b> <b>device</b> supplied 2 - 6 mg/L higher dissolved oxygen per meter of drop height, and after installation of the six-level, two-layer drop aeration devices, the 5 -day biochemical oxygen demand removal load was improved from 8. 1 to 14. 2 g m(- 2) day(- 1) for CW(1). With regard to the different filter media, nitrogen removal was improved by the adsorption of zeolite in the first year, with 5 - 36 % higher NH (4) (+) -N removal efficiency of CW(2) compared with that in CW(1). Since it did not have a significant positive effect on phosphate removal, dolomite can be replaced by zeolite. The chemical oxygen demand removal mainly took place in the upper 15 -cm filter layer in different operational phases, while nitrogen distribution along the depths of the VFCWs was different in different operational phases. In addition, as no operational problems occurred, the vertical flow constructed wetland system with drop aeration is an appropriate alternative for rural wastewater treatment, with numerous advantages of low capital and operation costs, no energy consumption, easy maintenance, high hydraulic loading rate, high pollutant removal efficiency, and no clogging...|$|E

The suggested relationships predict the volumetric oxygentransfer coefficient within a scatter of ± 15 %.

40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} studies {{were carried out}} with the aim of developing an improved <b>aeration</b> <b>device.</b> Many of the aeration devices currently in use contain fine pores, through which air is pumped to produce small bubbles in the diameter range of 2 to 3 mm in water, the objective being optimum performance in terms of mass transfer. Because of the very small pore size, these devices are often subject to clogging, consequent deterioration of efficiency and escalation of power requirements. The development of the new <b>aeration</b> <b>device,</b> named the SAF diffuser, is an attempt to generate bubbles of the optimum size range using relatively larger orifices so that the diffuser clogging and the energy requirements can be reduced. The SAF Diffuser comprises a vertical draft tube immersed in the water body to be aerated. A buoyancy: induced flow is created within the tube by injecting air through 0. 5 mm diameter peripheral orifices located near the inlet end. The induced flow exerts a drag force on the bubbles that are being formed at the peripheral orifices. This drag force causes the bubble to detach, from the orifice before it grows to the normal size attained in stagnant water. Utilizing this concept, hole sbes that are larger than (about 15 times) those used in conventional fine pore diffusers are possible. For a given air flowrate, the induced velocity and hence the bubble size depends upon the tube dimensions. This dependence provides a novel technique to control the bubble size. Theoretical {{and experimental}} study of the air-water flow as well as the mass transfer characteristics of the device were undertaken. Simple methods of measuring the two phase flow parameters were developed. Through theoretical analysis and experimentation, non-dimensional correlations to predict the phase velocities within the device as well as the mass transfer characteristics of the device were developed. The studies showed that for medium depth applications, the device can operate with 10 to 20 percent higher aeration efficiencies than conventional designs. Even higher efficiencies are possible in the low depth applications typical in aquaculture. Legislative Commission on Minnesota Resources; Metropolitan Waste Control Commissio...|$|E

Biological oxygen demand (BOD) and total nitrogen (TN) loading and escaping rates from each wetland were used to calculate carbonaceous and nitrogenous oxygen demands. Ammonia emissions were measured using a wind tunnel. Oxygen transfer efficiencies of the aerated ponds were estimated by conducting the ASCE standard oxygen transfer test in a tank using the same <b>aeration</b> <b>device.</b> Covering pond water surface with the floating bed slightly decreased oxygen transfer efficiency. The diffused membrane aeration (26. 7 kg O 2 ha- 1 d- 1) of M-P-M was surprisingly not as effective as plant aeration in the marsh (38. 9 to 42. 0 kg O 2 ha- 1 d- 1). This unusually low oxygen transfer efficiency of the diffused aeration was attributed to its low submergence depth of 0. 8 m compared to typical depth of 4. 5 m.

40|$|Aeration {{technology}} is applied {{in hundreds of}} Minnesota lakes and reservoirs {{for at least three}} purposes: (a) to prevent winterkill of fish in shallow lakes under ice cover, (b) to reduce nutrient release rates from the sediments and (c) in aquaculture to provide aerated water to high-density fish populations. A major uncertainty in the design, selection and application of aeration systems is the often observed increase in oxygen demand after aeration systems are installed and operated. As a result, the improvement in dissolved oxygen is often less than anticipated, even zero. In this study we have investigated this problem through a series of carefully designed experiments.

40|$|Irregularities on {{spillway}} surfaces will, in a {{high speed}} flow, cause small areas of flow separation. In these regions the pressure will be lowered and, if the velocities are high enough, the pressure may fall to below the local vapor pressure of the water. Vapor bubbles will form and, when they are carried away downstream into high pressure region, the bubbles collapse and possible cavitation damage may occur. Experimental investigations (Volkart and Rutschmann (1984) show that the damage can start at clear water velocities of between 12 to 15 m/s. Up to velocities of 20 m/s the surfaces may be protected by streamlining the boundaries, improving the surface finishes or using resistant materials.
