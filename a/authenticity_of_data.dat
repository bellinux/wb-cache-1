The US National Security Agency developed the Secure Hash Algorithm series of MD5-like hash functions: SHA-0 was a flawed algorithm that the agency withdrew; SHA-1 is widely deployed and more secure than MD5, but cryptanalysts have identified attacks against it; the SHA-2 family improves on SHA-1, but it isn't yet widely deployed; and the US standards authority thought it [...] "prudent" [...] from a security perspective to develop a new standard to [...] "significantly improve the robustness of NIST's overall hash algorithm toolkit."

It describes {{the concept of a}} zero-knowledge and cryptography primitives. Further, the basic principles are presented, the history of development, and various schemes are compared based on the construction and performance. The second part is given to the deployment and optimization of group signatures for computationally limited devices. Within the draft report were to be implemented in the Java language chosen scheme HLCCN, DP and BBS. They were then tested under various platforms which were measured and evaluated performance parameters of the schemes. The optimization of the work is focused on the times of signatures, which are critical to a smart grid system. Under the platforms are deployed pre-processed pairing optimization methods and other methods resulting from the deployment platform as JPBWrappera and native libraries to deliver more efficient times of sgnaiture.
