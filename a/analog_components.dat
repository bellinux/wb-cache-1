2500|$|Almost {{ten years}} later the second step was taken – the {{creation}} of [...] "quasi-digital" [...] hearing aid, in which the <b>analog</b> <b>components</b> and digital programmable module was combined into a single compact case. In this device the digital controller not only controlled the <b>analog</b> <b>components</b> (amplifiers, filters and signal limiter), {{but it could be}} programmed by connecting an external computer (in the laboratory – with medical supplies of hearing aids).|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} quasi-digital device was very {{successful}} from a practical point of view because of the low power consumption and compact size. At that time, low-power analog amplifier technology was developed very well – {{in contrast to the}} semiconductor chips necessary for a [...] "real" [...] digital camera. The combination of high performance <b>analog</b> <b>components</b> and digital signal processing capability has led to the creation module successful production parts.|$|E
2500|$|One key to {{the speed}} of analog {{computers}} was their fully parallel computation, but this was also a limitation. The more equations required for a problem, the more <b>analog</b> <b>components</b> were needed, even when the problem wasn't time critical. [...] "Programming" [...] a problem meant interconnecting the analog operators; even with a removable wiring panel this was not very versatile. Today {{there are no more}} big hybrid computers, but only hybrid components.|$|E

5000|$|These {{capacitors}} {{are often}} placed at each power source {{as well as}} at each <b>analog</b> <b>component</b> {{in order to ensure that}} the supplies are as steady as possible. Otherwise, an <b>analog</b> <b>component</b> with poor power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) will copy fluctuations in the power supply onto its output.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{potential}} copyright issues, when an <b>analog</b> <b>component</b> connection is used, only system menus and gameplay {{are available in}} 1080p; video content is displayed at a lower resolution or in 1080i. While 1080p <b>analog</b> <b>component</b> output {{is supported by the}} consoles, some display hardware will only accept component connections up to 1080i.|$|R
2500|$|When digital {{computers}} became {{widely used}} in the early 50s, this argument was extended {{to suggest that the}} brain was a vast physical symbol system, manipulating the binary symbols of zero and one. Dreyfus was able to refute the biological assumption by citing research in neurology that suggested that the action and timing of neuron firing had <b>analog</b> <b>components.</b> To be fair, however, Daniel Crevier observes that [...] "few still held that belief in the early 1970s, and nobody argued against Dreyfus" [...] about the biological assumption.|$|E
2500|$|Adjustable control: The audio circuit is analog with {{electronic}} components {{that can be}} adjusted. The hearing professional determines the gain and other specifications required for the wearer, and then adjusts the <b>analog</b> <b>components</b> either with small controls on the hearing aid itself or by having a laboratory build the hearing aid to meet those specifications. After the adjustment the resulting audio does not change any further, other than overall loudness that the wearer adjusts with a volume control. This type of circuitry is generally the least flexible. The first practical electronic hearing aid with adjustable analog audio circuitry was based on US Patent 2,017,358, [...] "Hearing Aid Apparatus and Amplifier" [...] by Samual Gordon Taylor, filed in 1932.|$|E
2500|$|The {{third stage}} of {{development}} was the appearance of [...] "real" [...] digital hearing aids. In DHA all stages of sound processing are carried out in binary form. To do this, an external sound from a microphone first converted into a binary code, and after the conversion the reverse transformation is carried out (to analog signal transmitted by the ear speaker {{in the form of}} sound). The first [...] "real" [...] DHA were models developed by Graup in 1970 {{on the basis of the}} 8080 microprocessor, which replaced the <b>analog</b> <b>components</b> (amplifier, limiter and filters). The possibilities of a programmable processor made the device self-adjusting, which opened the prospects for the use of advanced signal processing techniques, noise reduction, etc. Although the 8080th processor was relatively slow and big in size.|$|E

This paper proposes a descriptive formalism consisting of two layers, i. e., a system of symbolic aspect of constraints based on first order logic and a theory of cost or potential energy of the symbolic constraints. A grammar fragment is presented which accounts for some basic phenomena concerning complementation, adjunction and quantification of Japanese. This grammar reduces the combinatorial complexity, especially that of syntax, attributing relevant constraints to semantics and the <b>analog</b> <b>component</b> of the theory. A formal theory of the <b>analog</b> <b>component</b> is also sketched, and some implication of our approach with respect to cognitive science is discussed. ...|$|R
