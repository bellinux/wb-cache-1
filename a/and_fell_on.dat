5|$|Green Wings {{title is}} said to have come from a small plastic green man with wings that was in {{executive}} producer Peter Fincham's top pocket, <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>on</b> Pile's desk. Fincham claimed it was not his, so Pile kept it. This plastic man appears {{at the end of the}} credits on every show.|$|E
5|$|Occupied Belgium {{was also}} {{targeted}} by the Allied bombers from both the British RAF and American USAAF. The policy led to high civilian casualties as bombs missed their intended targets <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>on</b> civilian areas. In a raid on the Erla Motor Works in the Belgian town of Mortsel (near Antwerp) in April 1943, just two bombs dropped by the B-17s of the U.S. 8th Air Force fell on the intended target. The remaining 24 tons of bombs fell on civilian areas of the town, killing 936 and injuring 1,600 more in just eight minutes. The Allied policy was condemned by many leading figures within Belgium, including Cardinal van Roey.|$|E
5|$|As the two champions {{appeared}} {{they were}} greeted by a frenzy of excitement and everyone was on their feet to acclaim the two heroes. It was difficult to recognise them. Garin was first, followed by the mud-soaked figure of Cordang. Suddenly, to the stupefaction of everyone, Cordang slipped <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>on</b> the velodrome's cement surface. Garin could not believe his luck. By the time Cordang was back on his bike, he had lost 100 metres. There remained six laps to cover. Two miserable kilometres in which to catch Garin. The crowd held its breath as they watched the incredible pursuit match. The bell rang out. One lap, there remained one lap. 333 metres for Garin, who had a lead of 30 metres on the Batave.|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} it was {{believed}} that Alkan met his death when a bookcase toppled over <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>on</b> him as he reached for a volume of the Talmud from a high shelf. This tale, which was circulated by the pianist Isidor Philipp, is dismissed by Hugh Macdonald, who reports the discovery of a contemporary letter by one of his pupils explaining that Alkan had been found prostrate in his kitchen, under a porte-parapluie (a heavy coat/umbrella rack), after his concierge heard his moaning. He had possibly fainted, bringing it down on himself while grabbing out for support. He was reportedly carried to his bedroom and died later that evening. The story of the bookcase may have its roots in a legend told of Aryeh Leib ben Asher, rabbi of Metz, the town from which Alkan's family originated.|$|E
5|$|Lysacek {{began the}} 2007–2008 {{season at the}} 2007 Skate America. He underrotated <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>on</b> an {{attempted}} quadruple toe loop-triple toe loop in the short program, receiving only one point for that element. He was in second place going into the free skate. He won the free skate, landing a clean quadruple jump, {{but was unable to}} pull up to first overall, due to Daisuke Takahashi's twelve point lead after the short program. He went on to the 2007 Cup of China, where he won the short program with a score of 81.55, improving his personal best by almost thirteen points. He placed second in the free skate after falling on his quadruple jump, and finished second overall to Johnny Weir.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{arose from}} the Third Mithridatic War being fought between Roman Republic and Mithridates VI of Pontus, whose {{daughter}} Cleopatra was married to Tigranes. Mithridates fled to seek shelter with his son-in-law, and Rome invaded the Kingdom of Armenia. Having laid siege to Tigranocerta, the Roman forces fell back behind a nearby river when the large Armenian army approached. Feigning retreat, the Romans crossed at a ford <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>on</b> the right flank of the Armenian army. After the Romans defeated the Armenian cataphracts, the balance of Tigranes' army, which was mostly made up of raw levies and peasant troops from his extensive empire, panicked and fled, and the Romans remained {{in charge of the}} field.|$|E

5|$|With his {{improved}} ranking (No. 37), Raonic earned direct {{entry to}} Grand Slam tournaments and other ATP World Tour events {{for the first}} time. He reached the third round at both the Indian Wells Masters and the Monte-Carlo Masters. In May, Raonic rose to a new career-high ranking of No. 25. He was seeded {{for the first time}} at a Grand Slam event at the French Open, but lost in the first round to Michael Berrer. At the Halle Open, Raonic reached his first ATP World Tour doubles final, partnered with Robin Haase. The pair lost to Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi in the deciding super tiebreak. During his second round singles match at Wimbledon against Gilles Müller, Raonic retired with an early lead after injuring his right hip when he slipped <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>on</b> the grass. He underwent hip surgery which prevented him from competing until September. His only significant result in the latter half of 2011 after returning from injury was a semifinal appearance at the Stockholm Open, where he lost to Gaël Monfils.|$|E
5|$|Döblin {{completed}} work on November 1918 in {{the spring}} of 1943, but was unable to find a publisher. The only work of his that was published in German during his American exile was a private printing of 250 copies of the Nocturno episode from November 1918. Döblin was embittered by his isolation and setbacks in exile, drawing a strong distinction between his own situation and that of more successful writers less oppressed by material concerns, such as Lion Feuchtwanger and Thomas Mann. In honor of his 65th birthday, Helene Weigel organized a party on 14 August 1943 in Santa Monica. In attendance were Thomas Mann, Franz Werfel, Lion Feuchtwanger, and Bertolt Brecht, among others. Heinrich Mann gave a speech, Fritz Kortner, Peter Lorre, and Alexander Granach read aloud from Döblin's works, and he was presented with notes of congratulation and praise from Brecht, Max Horkheimer, and Alfred Polgar, among others. Compositions by Hanns Eisler were performed, and Blandine Ebinger sang Berlin chansons. Yet the festivities were dampened when Döblin gave a speech in which he mentioned his conversion to Catholicism; the religious, moral tone proved alienating, <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>on</b> unsympathetic ears.|$|E
5|$|The {{high winds}} knocked down trees and power lines across Long Island, New York, leaving roughly 170,000residents without electricity. Power crews from Pennsylvania {{were called in}} to assist in {{restoring}} electricity. Damage across the island reached $8million, of which $3million stemmed from erosion at Rockaway Beach. One person was killed in New York when a branch snapped off a tree due to high winds <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>on</b> her. An estimated 36,000residents in the lower Hudson Valley lost power. President Ford later declared Nassau, Suffolk, and Rensselaer counties major disaster areas. Effects were similar in Connecticut where approximately 247,000people lost electricity. Commuter train service along Conrail's New York–New Haven line was canceled due to power outages. A portion of the Merritt Parkway was closed due to downed trees. High winds in Bridgeport toppled many trees and power lines, shattered windows, and sparked two house fires. Five boats in the city's harbor sustained damage. Flooding in and around Danbury prompted evacuations of an apartment complex and motel. One fatality took place in Barkhamsted due to slippery roads. Overall damage in Connecticut was far less than expected, according to state police, with losses reaching $7.1million and mostly stemming from Fairfield and New Haven counties. Power companies brought in additional personnel to expedite the restoration process, though many remained in the dark days after the storm. A couple and their two dogs in Vernon died from carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator on August14.|$|E

The left {{battalion}} of the 57th formed square and drove off the horsemen. With their generals displaying front-line leadership, the Austrian attack roared {{out of the woods}} <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>on</b> the French troops lining the first ridge. The push collapsed in the face of converging musketry from the defenders' concave line and a thrust against its left flank by the 3rd Line.|$|E
25|$|During January and February 1945, XXXIII Corps seized {{crossings}} {{over the}} Irrawaddy River near Mandalay. There was heavy fighting, which attracted Japanese reserves and fixed their attention. Late in February, the 7th Indian Division leading IV Corps, seized crossings at Nyaungu near Pakokku. 17th Indian Division and 255th Indian Tank Brigade followed them across and struck for Meiktila. In the open terrain of Central Burma, this force outmanoeuvered the Japanese <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>on</b> Meiktila on 1 March.

25|$|At around 12:30 Miloradovich {{tried to}} speak to the rebel troops and was fatally shot by Pyotr Kakhovsky and stabbed by Yevgeny Obolensky.

Nicholas, still hoping to avoid bloodshed, ordered an intimidating cavalry charge against the rebels. It miserably failed as horses lost balance <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>on</b> icy pavement. As time passed by, civilians flooded the square, forming a dense circle around the loyalists troops. Nicholas feared that the mob may overwhelm his troops after sunset. Worse, he saw his own soldiers defecting to the rebels.|$|E

Peter Herdic was the inventor of the Herdic cab (a precursor to the taxi), which was a two-wheeled horse-drawn carriage with side seats and a rear entrance. Peter Herdic died on February 2, 1888 as the result of a concussion sustained when he slipped <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>on</b> ice while inspecting his waterworks in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania.|$|E

Despite efforts to lighten her, she took on water <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>on</b> her side. The other vessels of the squadron came to her aid and took off her crew and such stores and provisions as could be saved. On 11 November, the day after she grounded, her crew set her on fire, which destroyed her.|$|E
