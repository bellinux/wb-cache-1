5|$|After the 1973 {{season the}} team fired Webster, who later {{admitted}} {{his heart was}} never in head coaching, and said he more enjoyed life as an assistant. They hired retired star defensive end Andy Robustelli to run their football operations, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator Bill Arnsparger as the team's head coach. Arnsparger had built an enviable reputation as {{the architect of the}} Dolphins defense which helped the team to two Super Bowl championships. Robustelli traded their 1975 first round draft choice to the Cowboys (who used it to select Hall of Fame defensive lineman Randy White) for quarterback Craig Morton {{in the middle of the}} 1974 season.|$|E

25|$|Dolphy {{was born}} in Los Angeles to Eric Allan Dolphy, Sr. and Sadie Dolphy, who immigrated to the United States from Panama. He picked up the {{clarinet}} {{at the age of}} six, and {{in less than a month}} was playing in the school's orchestra. He also learned the oboe in junior high school, though he never recorded on the instrument. Hearing Fats Waller, Duke Ellington and Coleman Hawkins led him toward jazz, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> up the saxophone and flute while in high school. His father built a studio for Eric in their backyard, and Eric often had friends come by to jam; recordings with Clifford Brown from this studio document this early time.|$|E
25|$|With few {{survival}} skills having left school around {{the age of}} thirteen, he realized that formal employment {{was out of the}} question. His only ability was acquired from his father's vocation as a singer, and he joined with a few other youngsters who went to saloons on the Bowery and sang to customers. Itinerant young singers like them were common on the Lower East Side. Berlin would sing a few of the popular ballads he heard on the street, hoping people would pitch him a few pennies. From these seamy surroundings he became street wise, with a real and lasting education. Music was his only source of income <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> up the language and culture of the ghetto lifestyle.|$|E
25|$|The {{initial budget}} was $8 million but during pre-production, {{it became obvious}} that this {{was not going to be}} enough. Darkman was also a {{financial}} success and De Laurentiis had a multi-picture deal with Universal and so Army of Darkness became one of the films. The studio decided to contribute half of the film's $12 million budget. However, the film's ambitious scope and its extensive effects work forced Campbell, Raimi and producer Robert Tapert to put up $1 million of their collective salaries to shoot a new ending and not film a scene where a possessed woman pushes down some giant pillars. Visual effects supervisor William Mesa showed Raimi storyboards he had from Victor Fleming's film Joan of Arc that depicted huge battle scenes <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> out 25 shots to use in Army of Darkness. A storyboard artist worked closely with the director in order to blend the shots from the Joan of Arc storyboards with the battle scenes in his film.|$|E

Late in the 1942–43 season, they received permission from Kennedy's mother {{to take him out}} of school so he could accompany them on a road trip. He played in two of the final three games of the regular season, but did not continue with them into the playoffs. Making his NHL debut March 7, 1943, against the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden, he was put on the Leafs' third line on rightwing, instead of his customary centre position, on a line with Bud Poile and Gaye Stewart. He was told by coach Hap Day to simply [...] "stay with your check and keep him from scoring." [...] Kennedy's line scored three goals <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> up one assist in a 5–5 tie. He then picked another assist in the next game in Boston. Kennedy had impressed the Leaf coaches, but his rights were still [...] "officially" [...] owned by the Montreal Canadiens.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the next}} few years Iwata {{composed}} music for titles from a number of different companies, including Quest. On several of these titles he was credited by the nickname REZON. The nickname comes from the name of the car the hero drove in a show he watched as a child, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> it up as he liked the sound of it. Iwata's first encounter with mainstream success in Japan came about in 1993 when he composed [...] along with Sakimoto. The soundtrack included a wide variety of instrumentation in its orchestral score, which was new to the composers who chose some instruments from a musical instrument description book Iwata had found. This collaboration led to Iwata co-composing several titles with Sakimoto over {{the next few}} years, culminating with his first brush with international success with Final Fantasy Tactics in 1997. On these collaborations, the two typically divided up the work and worked on their own tracks, rather than co-compose each piece. Iwata also collaborated with several other artists during this period in his career, including Toshiaki Sakoda and Masanobu Tsukamoto.|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} Ba Zaw’s early {{training}} as a painter is a patchwork of contradictory claims. For example, Ludu Daw Amar and Ko Ko Naing describe Ba Zaw as self-taught and maintain that he learned painting by studying from books. Min Naing, on the other hand, mentions that the doyen of Traditional painting in Burma {{at the turn of}} the century, Saya Chone (18661917), was an instructor of Ba Zaw while Ba Zaw taught at St. Paul’s High School and offers convincing details about their interaction. Nyan Shein claims that Ba Ohn (c. 1877 [...] fl. 1924) was one of Ba Zaw’s teachers, and Ko Ko Naing acknowledges the influence that the three early British chairmen and teachers of the Burma Art Club (BAC)—Martin Ward, Martin Jones, and E.G.N. Kinch—had on Ba Zaw, which is almost certainly true. The BAC was informally organized in 1913 as a venue where amateur British colonial painters in Burma might meet and exchange skills, and became more officially established in 1918. Toward the later date, the BAC began to train Burmese painters. Ba Zaw was one of the earliest Burmese members of the club, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> up much from its lectures. Ko Ko Naing and Amar’s claim that Ba Zaw was self-taught is accurate in the sense that Ba Zaw was self-taught to a degree. He won scholarships or painting competitions when he was a youngster before he encountered Ba Ohn, Saya Chone or British painters.|$|E

He made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka at Sharjah in the Austral-Asia Cup on 25 April 1990. He played one more game in the series against Pakistan and ended up picking two wickets. His Test debut came {{in the same year}} when India toured England for a three-test series.

This performance helped him earn a place in the Indian side that toured South Africa and Zimbabwe. It was during the 1992 Indian tour of South Africa that he established himself as a quality spinner, taking eight wickets in the second Test. All in all he took 18 wickets at an average of 25.94 and with an economy rate of 1.84 in the four test series.
