5|$|ABC {{regulations}} {{permit a}} bar owner or employee {{to give away}} a free drink <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not advertised. Businesses may issue free or complimentary drink coupons (up to one per day per patron). Hotel and motel licensees may also give guests complimentary bottles of wine on special occasions. Licensed establishments are permitted to institute dress codes, cover charges, and minimum age restrictions. Liquor stores are allowed to conduct tastings of beer, wine, and spirits. Bars, restaurants, state concessionaires (e.g. PNC Bank Arts Center), and non-profit organizations with a special permit can host both tastings and tasting dinners, the latter of which permits larger sample sizes.|$|E

5|$|According to the Coat of Arms Act, {{everyone}} {{can use the}} Polish flag, especially during national and cultural events, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> done in a respectful manner. This liberty {{in the use of}} national colors is a relative novelty. Until 2004, Polish citizens were only allowed to fly the Polish flag on national holidays. The use of both variants was restricted, but only flying the flag with coat of arms was, from 1955 until 1985, punishable by a fine or arrest for up to one year. After 1985, unauthorized use of any national symbols was an infraction. A possible explanation to such harsh measures {{was the fact that the}} officially-promoted holiday of May 1st was separated by only one day from the pre-war (and current) national holiday of Poland, the anniversary of signing of the Constitution of May 3, 1791. While hoisting a flag on May 1 was acceptable, no later than the following day it must have been hidden.|$|E
5|$|Although NFL rules {{generally}} require {{wide receivers}} to wear jersey {{numbers in the}} 10-19 and 80-89 range, players who later change positions are allowed to keep their previous number, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not within the 50-79 range for eligible receiver purposes. Hester was allowed to keep number 23, a number normally used for cornerbacks, since it sits outside the 50-79 range. Along with former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Dwight Stone, who wore number 20 during his eight-year stint in Pittsburgh, Hester {{was one of two}} wide receivers to wear a 20's jersey number since the NFL adopted the current uniform numbering system in 1973.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Plateosaurus {{is small and}} narrow, {{rectangular}} in side view, and nearly three times <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> high. There is an almost rectangular lateral temporal foramen at the back. The large, round orbit (eye socket), the sub-triangular antorbital fenestra and the oval naris (nostril) are of almost equal size. The jaws carried many small, leaf-shaped, socketed teeth: 5 to 6 per premaxilla, 24 to 30 per maxilla, and 21 to 28 per dentary (lower jaw). The thick, leaf-shaped, bluntly serrated tooth crowns were suitable for crushing plant material. The low position of the jaw joint gave the chewing muscles great leverage, so that Plateosaurus could deliver a powerful bite. These features suggest that it fed primarily to exclusively on plants. Its eyes were directed to the sides, rather than the front, providing all-round vision to watch for predators. Some fossil skeletons have preserved sclerotic rings (rings of bone plates that protect the eye).|$|E

5|$|There are {{different}} types of starts for races of different distances. Middle- and long-distance races mainly use the waterfall start. This is when all athletes begin on a curved line that moves farther out at {{the outer edge of}} the track. Competitors are allowed to move towards the inside lane right away, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> safe to do so. For some middle-distance races, such as 800m, each athlete starts in their own lane. Once the gun fires, they must run in the lane they began in until markers on the track notify them it is time to move towards the inside lane. For sprint races, athletes begin in start blocks and must stay in their own lane for the entire race.|$|E
5|$|This species {{lives in}} many habitats, {{including}} deserts, forests, woodland and urban areas. They nest underground below logs, stones, twigs, and shrubs, or in decayed wooden stumps, and are sometimes found living in termite mounds. They {{are among the}} first insects {{to be found in}} burnt-off areas after the embers have stopped smouldering. Rain presents no threat to colonies <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a light shower in continuous sunshine. The green-head ant is diurnal, active throughout the day, preying on arthropods and small insects or collecting sweet substances such as honeydew from sap-sucking insects. They {{play an important role in}} seed dispersal, scattering and consuming seeds from a variety of species. Predators include the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) and a number of bird species.|$|E
5|$|Viewed {{from the}} top, the parietal {{increases}} in width at the back; {{the increase is}} small in K. langenbergensis, such that the bone is overall rectangular, but the difference is larger in K. guimarotae. The back of the bone bears a small notch in K. langenbergensis and a general concavity in K. guimarotae that slightly exposes the underlying supraoccipital. The postorbital bears two branches that join with a gentle curve, separated by an angle of 130° in K. langenbergensis. The supratemporal fenestra is roughly square in K. guimarotae but has a thinner back end in K. langenbergensis. In both species, the maximum distance between the supratemporal fenestrae is {{about a third of}} the total width of the top of the skull. The trapezoidal infratemporal fenestra is 1.5 times <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> wide in K. langenbergensis.|$|E

5|$|The {{heads of}} the workers and queens are as long as broad with convexed sides. The mandibles are long with {{thirteen}} known teeth. The first and third segments of the funiculus are equally long. The thorax is longer than broad by two to three-fourths its width, and the mesonotum is longer than it is broad in workers; the mesonotum is broader than it is long in queens. The node (a segment between the mesosoma and gaster) is <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> broad, and the postpetiole is one-sixth broader than long. The first segment of the gaster is broader than its length. M.regularis shares a similar appearance to M.forficata, but there are several morphological differences that separate the two. Owing to the rugose sculpture {{of the head and}} thorax, M.regularis is noticeably smaller than M.forficata. The mandibles of M.regularis are much narrower, the posterior corners of the head are more round and the petiolar peduncle is longer. The mandibles appear to be deep red, and some areas, such as the gastric segments, are golden brown.|$|E
