40|$|Background {{and purpose}} The {{association}} of leg length discrepancy (LLD) {{with a number}} of clinical disorders has made its determination {{a significant part of the}} physical examination. We believe that submalleolar causes of LLD may be under-acknowledged. The most common clinical method used to measure LLD is by tape from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) to medial malleolus which disregards the potential for LLD arising from asymmetry in the foot distal to the tibiotalar joint. Methods The present pilot study involves a group of 5 volunteers (experimental group) and a group of 3 patients with flexible flat feet (clinical study). The differences in tibial tubercle height from the ground between full pronation and full supination were measured using the CODA MPX 30 ® system (Charnwood Dynamics Limited, Leicestershire, England). Correlations of the patterns within each group were produced. Results A significant relationship with leg lengths was found in the experimental group when they induced maximum pronation (R-squared = 0. 62, p = 0. 007) while an inverse relationship occurred with supination, although marginally significant (R-squared = 0. 37, p = 0. 064). Conclusions We have demonstrated that significant leg length discrepancy can occur in patients who do not have obvious deformity when non weight bearing. We recommend using the blocks method routinely. Appropriately measuring LLD is of vital importance to properly diagnosing and treating patients <b>with</b> <b>unequal</b> <b>leg</b> lengths or related symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Split-belt {{locomotion}} (i. e., walking <b>with</b> <b>unequal</b> <b>leg</b> speeds) {{requires a}} rapid adaptation of biomechanical parameters and therefore of leg muscle electromyographic (EMG) activity. This adaptational process {{during the first}} strides of asymmetric gait as well as learning effects induced by repetition were studied in 11 healthy volunteers. Subjects were switched from slow (0. 5 m/s) symmetric gait to split-belt locomotion with speeds of 0. 5 m/s and 1. 5 m/s, respectively. All subjects were observed to adapt in a similar way: (1) during the first trial, adaptation required about 12 - 15 strides. This was achieved {{by an increase in}} stride cycle duration, i. e., an increase in swing duration on the fast side and an increase in support duration on the slow side. (2) Adaptation of leg extensor and flexor EMG activity paralleled the changes of biomechanical parameters. During the first strides, muscle activity was enhanced with no increase in coactivity of antagonistic leg muscles. (3) A motor learning effect was seen when the same paradigm was repeated a few minutes later - interrupted by symmetric locomotion - as adaptation to the split-belt speeds was achieved within 1 - 3 strides. (4) This short-time learning effect did not occur in the ''mirror'' condition when the slow and fast sides were inverted. In this case adaptation again required 12 - 15 strides. A close link between central and proprioceptive mechanisms of interlimb coordination is suggested to underlie the adaptational processes during split-belt conditions. It can be assumed that, as in quadrupedal locomotion of the cat, human bipedal locomotion involves separate locomotor generators to provide the flexibility demanded. The present results suggest that side-specific proprioceptive information regarding the dynamics of the movement is necessary to adjust the centrally generated locomotor activity for both legs to the actual needs for controlled locomotion. Although the required pattern is quickly learned, this learning effect cannot be transferred to the contralateral side...|$|R
40|$|Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) {{may offer}} a viable {{alternative}} of traditional transistor-based technology at the nanoscale. When modeling a QCA circuit, the number of degrees of freedom necessary to describe the quantum mechanical state increases exponentially making modeling even modest size cell arrays difficult. The intercellular Hartree approximation largely reduces the number of state variables and still gives good results especially when the system remains near ground state. This suggests that {{large part of the}} correlation degrees of freedom are not essential {{from the point of view}} of the dynamics. In certain cases, however, such as for example the majority gate <b>with</b> <b>unequal</b> input <b>legs,</b> the Hartree approximation gives qualitatively wrong results. An intermediate model is constructed between the Hartree approximation and the exact model, based on the coherence vector formalism. By including correlation effects to a desired degree, it improves the results of the Hartree method and gives the approximate dynamics of the correlation terms. It also models the majority gate correctly. Beside QCA cell arrays, our findings are valid for Ising spin chains in transverse magnetic field, and can be straightforwardly generalized for coupled two-level systems with a more complicated Hamiltonian.

40|$|The {{geometry}} of angle sections is simple, but the behaviour and design calculations of angle sections {{can be quite}} complicated. Furthermore, lipped <b>angle</b> sections <b>with</b> <b>unequal</b> flange widths form a non-symmetric section and the behaviour of the section is even more complicated than a singly-symmetric <b>angle</b> section <b>with</b> equal flange widths. A test program on cold-formed steel non-symmetric lipped angle columns is presented. The non-symmetric angle sections were brake-pressed from high strength structural steel sheets having nominal yield stresses of 450 and 550 MPa with plate thicknesses of 1. 0, 1. 5 and 1. 9  mm. The material properties of the column specimens were obtained by tensile coupon tests. The behaviour and strengths of cold-formed steel non-symmetric lipped angle columns were investigated. The test strengths are compared with the design strengths calculated using the North American Specification {{for the design of}} cold-formed steel structural members. In addition, the current design rules in the North American Specification for cold-formed steel non-symmetric lipped angle columns are assessed using reliability analysis. It is shown that the design strengths are generally quite conservative. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Code {{design for}} the {{noncoherent}} MIMO Rayleigh fading channel is considered for constellations <b>with</b> <b>unequal</b> prior probabilities. The motivation for such constellations <b>with</b> <b>unequal</b> priors arises from recent information theoretic results at low Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Different distance measures like the Bhattacharya distance and J-divergence {{are related to the}} average pairwise error probability (APEP) and are employed to design single antenna codes of general dimension both for equal and unequal priors. For equal priors, such codes are observed to perform at least as well, and often better than codes designed based on the Kullback-Liebler (KL) distance in the low SNR regime. Substantial performance gains are observed for codes designed <b>with</b> <b>unequal</b> prior probabilities in the low SNR regime as compared to codes designed with equal priors. I...|$|R
