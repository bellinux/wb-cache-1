The emergency number differs from country to country; it is typically a three-digit number {{so that it can be}} easily remembered <b>and</b> <b>dialed</b> quickly. Some countries have a different emergency number for each of the different emergency services; these often differ only by the last digit. See List of emergency telephone numbers.|$|E

50|$|In {{centralized}} AMA (CAMA), the originating Class 5 telephone switches used automatic number identification (ANI) and multi-frequency (MF) signaling to {{send the}} originating <b>and</b> <b>dialed</b> telephone numbers to the Class 4 toll connecting office. The Class 4 office recorded this information with punched tape machines on long strips of paper, that had approximately {{the width of a}} hand. Each day a technician cut the paper tapes and sent them to the accounting center to be read and processed to generate customer telephone bills. Each punch recorder was responsible for 100 trunks, and its associated call identity indexer (CII) identified the trunk for an initial entry when connecting the call, an answer entry when the called party answered, and a disconnect entry when the call was cleared.|$|E

40|$|High {{temporal}} and spatial resolution measurements by both space-borne and ground-based instruments are therefore necessary to monitor atmospheric water vapor for climate purposes. Lidar techniques can accomplish ground-based measurements of atmospheric water vapor with high space and time resolution. A lidar system capable to perform simultaneous measurements of atmospheric water vapor and aerosols has been developed in Potenza, Southern Italy, {{in the context of}} a cooperation between the Universita della Basilicata and Istituto di Metodologie Avanzate di Analisi Ambientale. An intensive measurement campaign was performed during 1997 in Potenza aimed to the simultaneous application of the Raman <b>and</b> <b>DIAL</b> techniques for water vapor ground- based lidar measurements. Raman <b>and</b> <b>DIAL</b> humidity measurements performed during 1997 in Potenza aimed to the simultaneous application of the Raman <b>and</b> <b>DIAL</b> techniques for water vapor ground-based lidar measurements. Raman <b>and</b> <b>DIAL</b> humidity measurements performed at night in the Planetary Boundary Layer have been compared with simultaneous radiosonde data obtained from both free and captive balloons. The agreement among Raman, <b>DIAL</b> <b>and</b> radiosonde data is found to be within 30 percent up to approximately 1. 5 km. Results from this measurement campaign will be reported and discussed in this paper...|$|R
