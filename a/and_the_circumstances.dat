5|$|In {{response}} to the incident <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> of Lubitz's involvement, aviation authorities in some countries implemented new regulations that require the presence of two authorized personnel in the cockpit at all times.

Several airlines announced that they had already adopted similar policies voluntarily.|$|E
5|$|In {{the game}} of baseball, the {{official}} scorer is a person appointed by the league to record the events on the field, and to send the official scoring record of the game back to the league offices. In addition to recording the events on the field such as the outcome of each plate appearance <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> of any baserunner's advance around the bases, the official scorer is also charged with making judgment calls that do not affect the progress or outcome of the game. Judgment calls are primarily made about errors, unearned runs, fielder's choice, the value of hits in certain situations, and wild pitches, {{all of which are}} included in the record compiled. This record is used to compile statistics for each player and team. A box score is a summary of the official scorer's game record.|$|E
5|$|Laminar {{boundary}} layers can be loosely classified {{according to}} their structure <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> under which they are created. The thin shear layer which develops on an oscillating body {{is an example of}} a Stokes boundary layer, while the Blasius boundary layer refers to the well-known similarity solution near an attached flat plate held in an oncoming unidirectional flow and Falkner–Skan boundary layer, a generalization of Blasius profile. When a fluid rotates and viscous forces are balanced by the Coriolis effect (rather than convective inertia), an Ekman layer forms. In the theory of heat transfer, a thermal boundary layer occurs. A surface can have multiple types of boundary layer simultaneously.|$|E

5|$|On March 29, 2010, Van der Sloot {{contacted}} John Q. Kelly—Beth Twitty's legal representative—with {{an offer}} to reveal the location of Holloway's body <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> surrounding her death, if he were given advance of US$25,000 against a total of $250,000. After Kelly notified the FBI, they arranged {{to proceed with the}} transaction. On May 10, Van der Sloot had a $15,000 wire transferred to his account in the Netherlands, following the receipt of $10,000 in cash that was videotaped by undercover investigators in Aruba. Authorities stated that the information that he provided in return was false because the house in which he said Holloway's body was located had not yet been built {{at the time of her}} disappearance. On June 3, Van der Sloot was charged in the U.S. District Court of Northern Alabama with extortion and wire fraud. U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance obtained an arrest warrant and transmitted it to Interpol. On June 30, Van der Sloot was indicted on the charges.|$|E
5|$|Since no {{documents}} {{exist to}} confirm {{the content of the}} Mise of Lewes, there has been much debate among historians over its content, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> under which it was written. Noël Denholm-Young, in an article published in 1933, made a conjecture on what the main points of the agreement were. The first point, according to Denholm-Young, was that Prince Edward and his cousin, Henry of Almain, should be given over to the barons as hostages. Secondly, those of the baronial party who had been taken hostage at Northampton were to be released. Thirdly, those who had taken hostages from the royalist party at the Battle of Lewes were to receive ransom. Finally, it was agreed that a committee of French clergy and nobles should arbitrate over a permanent settlement. This interpretation has been largely followed by later historians.|$|E
5|$|Sites in Africa {{have been}} marked as such {{for a variety}} of reasons, such as {{deforestation}} and hunting, civil war, threats to and hostage taking of reserve staff, oil and gas projects and mining, declines in biodiversity, and structural damage to buildings. Three sites were formerly declared as being in danger, but have since lost the status: the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (19841989), the Rwenzori Mountains National Park (19992004), and Tipasa (20022006). The Garamba National Park and Timbuktu have also lost their statuses in 1992 and 2005, respectively, but later regained it in 1996 and 2012. Despite its large number of endangered sites <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> surrounding them, African World Heritage Sites have never been stripped of their title, something that has only occurred twice.|$|E

5|$|Taphonomy is {{the study}} of the {{processes}} an organism’s body undergoes after it dies, which includes a study of preservation, the cause of death, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> of burial. The large, monospecific assemblage of Hypacrosaurus stebingeri in Montana was interpreted as a group of dinosaurs that was killed by a volcanic ashfall. This assemblage is considered autochthonous, meaning that the remains are thought to have been buried on or near the same spot where the individuals died. The variety of ages in this group supports that this was a biocoenosis- an actual life assemblage of animals. The cause of death in a volcanic ashfall is suffocation by the ash and by the gases released from volcanic eruptions. The preservation of this diverse group of dinosaurs provides researchers with a growth series, which is a sequence of growth stages from juvenile to adult.|$|E
5|$|The election, meanwhile, had aroused papal {{suspicions of}} undue royal influence, and Innocent sent Stephen Langton, the exiled Archbishop of Canterbury to {{investigate}} Hugh <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> of his election. Langton was also to investigate rumours that Hugh was not celibate, {{and had two}} daughters. The {{results of the investigation}} must have been satisfactory, as Hugh was consecrated on 20 December 1209 at Melun. The consecration was performed by Langton. Hugh was in exile in France until he returned to England on 16 July 1213. His only known activity while in exile was the writing of a will, which was dated November 1212 and was drawn up at St Martin de Garenne, near Paris.|$|E
5|$|The women {{performed}} up to {{six hours}} a day, either singing their own florid repertoire from memory, sight-reading from partbooks, or participating in the balletti as singers and dancers. Thomasin LaMay posits that {{the women of the}} concerti delle donne provided sexual favors for members of the court, but there is no evidence for this, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> of their marriages and dowries argues against this interpretation. The women were paid salaries and received other benefits, such as dowries and apartments in the ducal palace. Peverara received 300 scudi a year and lodging in the ducal palace for herself, her husband, and her mother - as well as a dowry of 10,000 scudi upon her marriage.|$|E

5|$|Recording {{sessions}} for The Joshua Tree began in January 1986 in Danesmoate House in Dublin and continued throughout the year. U2 briefly interrupted these sessions in June to join Amnesty International's A Conspiracy of Hope tour of benefit concerts. Following the first concert in San Francisco, lead singer Bono met René Castro, a Chilean mural artist. Castro had been tortured {{and held in}} a concentration camp for two years by the dictatorial Chilean government because his artwork criticised the Pinochet-led regime that seized power in 1973 during a coup d'état. Castro showed Bono a wall painting in the Mission District that depicted the ongoing plight in Chile and Argentina. He also learned of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo, {{a group of women}} whose children were forcibly disappeared by the Argentine government. The Madres' children were students who had opposed the government during the Dirty War, and the coup d'état that brought Jorge Rafael Videla to power. The Madres joined together to campaign for information regarding the locations of their children's bodies <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> of their deaths, believing them to have been kidnapped, tortured, and murdered.|$|E
