This has kept them a {{structurally}} sound breed which is predominantly free from the physical exaggerations {{that can lead to}} certain health problems. Whippets are, like other sighthounds, intolerant of barbiturate <b>anaesthetics.</b> This is in part due to their low concentration of body fat and their liver's inability to metabolise the <b>anaesthetics.</b>|$|E

5|$|While {{stationed}} at the River Valley Road prisoner of war hospital in Singapore in 1945, with the supplies of chemical <b>anæsthetics</b> severely restricted by the Japanese, Woodruff and a medical/dental colleague from the Royal Netherlands Forces successfully used hypnotism as the sole means of anæsthesia {{for a wide range}} of dental and surgical procedures.|$|E
5|$|Practical uses include as food (entomophagy), in medicine, for the {{valuable}} textile silk, for dyestuffs such as carmine, in science, where the fruit fly {{is an important}} model organism in genetics, and in warfare, where insects were successfully used in the Second World War to spread disease in enemy populations. One insect, the honey bee, provides honey, pollen, royal jelly, propolis and an anti-inflammatory peptide, melittin; its larvae too are eaten in some societies. Medical uses of insects include maggot therapy for wound debridement. Over a thousand protein families {{have been identified in}} the saliva of blood-feeding insects; these may provide useful drugs such as anticoagulants, vasodilators, antihistamines and <b>anaesthetics.</b>|$|E
5|$|The larger arteries {{throughout}} the brain supply blood to smaller capillaries. These smallest {{of blood vessels}} in the brain, are lined with cells joined by tight junctions and so fluids do not seep in or leak out to the same degree as they do in other capillaries, thereby creating the blood-brain barrier. Pericytes {{play a major role in}} the formation of the tight junctions. The barrier is less permeable to larger molecules, but is still permeable to water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and most fat-soluble substances (including <b>anaesthetics</b> and alcohol). The blood-brain barrier is not present in areas of the brain that may need to respond to changes in body fluids, such as the pineal gland, area postrema, and some areas of the hypothalamus. There is a similar blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier, which serves the same purpose as the blood–brain barrier, but facilitates the transport of different substances into the brain due to the distinct structural characteristics between the two barrier systems.|$|E
50|$|From the {{correlation}} between lipid solubility and <b>anaesthetic</b> potency, both Meyer and Overton had surmised a unitary mechanism of general anaesthesia. They assumed that solubilization of lipophilic general <b>anaesthetic</b> in lipid bilayer of the neuron causes its malfunction and <b>anaesthetic</b> effect when critical concentration of <b>anaesthetic</b> is reached. Later in 1973 Miller and Smith suggested the critical volume hypothesis also called lipid bilayer expansion hypothesis. They assumed that bulky and hydrophobic <b>anaesthetic</b> molecules accumulate inside the hydrophobic (or lipophilic) regions of neuronal lipid membrane causing its distortion and expansion (thickening) due to volume displacement. Accumulation of critical amounts of <b>anaesthetic</b> causes membrane thickening sufficient to reversibly alter function of membrane ion channels thus providing <b>anaesthetic</b> effect. Actual chemical structure of the <b>anaesthetic</b> agent per se is not important, but its molecular volume plays the major role: the more space within membrane is occupied by <b>anaesthetic</b> - the greater is the <b>anaesthetic</b> effect. Based on this theory, in 1954 Mullins suggested that the Meyer-Overton correlation with potency can be improved if molecular volumes of <b>anaesthetic</b> molecules are taken into account. This theory existed for over 60 years and was supported by experimental fact that increases in atmospheric pressure reverse <b>anaesthetic</b> effect (pressure reversal effect).|$|R
50|$|An <b>anaesthetic</b> {{vaporizer}} is {{a device}} generally attached to an <b>anaesthetic</b> machine which delivers a given concentration of a volatile <b>anaesthetic</b> agent.

40|$|Background: In Sectio caesaria, the {{traumatic}} injury will cause response of stress. Response of stress {{will increase the}} blood glucose. Spinal <b>anaesthetic</b> was guess can increase the blood glucose. Objective: Finding the effect of spinal <b>anaesthetic</b> toward blood glucose in sectio caesaria. Methods: This was an analytic description study. It was cross sectional design. The samples were chosen by consecutive sampling. Total samples were 20 sectio caesaria patients, 20 to 35 years old, with certain criteria. Sampels with spinal <b>anaesthetic</b> and blood glucose arteriola measure 3 times: before spinal <b>anaesthetic,</b> 5 minutes after <b>anaesthetic</b> and 60 minutes after operate begin by using Blood Glucose Test Meter GlucoDr. Results: By using statistic tests, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test, {{there was no significant}} difference between the number of blood glucose pre spinal <b>anaesthetic</b> and 5 minutes after spinal anaesthetic(p= 0, 056), between the number of blood glucose pre spinal <b>anaesthetic</b> and 60 minutes after operate begin (p= 0, 239), the number of blood glucose 5 minutes after spinal <b>anaesthetic</b> and 60 minutes after operate begin (p= 0, 089).

40|$|An <b>anaesthetic</b> circuit or {{system can}} be defined as that part of <b>anaesthetic</b> {{apparatus}} which is used to connect the patient to the <b>anaesthetic</b> machine deployed to deliver predetermined volumes and concentration of oxygen, <b>anaesthetic</b> gases and volatile agents. This can easily be achieved by using a length of tubing, supplying the <b>anaesthetic</b> mixture from the machine to the patient. But it is highly desirable to have a proper circuit or system between the patient and the <b>anaesthetic</b> machine due to the following reasons: (a) The patient is to be provided with a desired, balanced and congenial breathing atmosphere. Some <b>anaesthetic</b> circuits may tend to modify the concentration of gases and vapours which are actually delivered to the patient. (b) The re-breathing of exhaled <b>anaesthetic</b> mixture requires to be prevented or minimised. Accumulation of CO 2 due to re-breathing also reduces the inspired concentration of O 2 and <b>anaesthetic</b> mixture in use.
