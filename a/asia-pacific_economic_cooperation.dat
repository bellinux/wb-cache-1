40|$|The {{research}} of which {{this paper is}} a component focuses {{on the development of}} multilateral cooperation through institutions, process and systems in the <b>Asia-Pacific</b> region. <b>Economic</b> networks are probably the most developed of the cooperative processes in the region. The language used in their establishment and the functions undertaken by them indicates that it is becoming possible to consider the economic networks as precursors to deeper forms of regional community; forms that could supersede the state as the focus for loyalty and identity. That is not a necessary outcome and it is not likely in the short term, but it is possible. <b>Asia-Pacific,</b> <b>economic</b> networks, regionalism, regional <b>cooperation,</b> <b>economic</b> networking, <b>economic</b> <b>cooperation,...</b>|$|R
