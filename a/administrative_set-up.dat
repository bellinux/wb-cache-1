40|$|International audienceRisk {{allocation}} in contracts is {{an important}} issue for both economics and law. It questions the theorerical, methodological, empirical foundations of economic and legal analysis. It also offers a valuable ground for comparative legal-economic inquiry. The article aims at providing some insights into that general perpective, and proceeds with an articulation of theoretical and empirical analysis. The paper first offers a critical analysis of some key economic basis hypothesis on law, contract law and legal institutions, notably the courts. It concentrates on various componants of the New Institutional Economics stream that are {{something to do with the}} notion of contractual incompletedness. The emphasis is put on two central issues : the contract-institutions relations, and the scope of incompleteness as a guide for empirical research into the economic dimensions of contract law. The second part of the article compares and evaluates the significance of the economic concept of incompletedness and theFrench legal notion of imprévision, which relates to a notion that the <b>administrative</b> courts have <b>set-up</b> to decide cases in which the occurrence of unforeseen events affects the contractual equilibria built ex ante. The analysis then moves toward the research of a legal and empirical translation of uncertainty of the future. The article argues that positive legal provisions in contract law enable co-contractors to set-up a framework in which the consequences unforeseen events can be adressed. Legal provisions such as those which relate to conditional duties, aleatory contracts, force majeure, fortious events, price revision, hardship, are examples of tools that allow a significant amount of previsibility in contractual relations, particularilly long-term contracts. We then offer an empirical analysis of a specific legal notion : the imprévision. The analysis is based on legal data, namely the French Conseil d'Etat decisions that deal with a request for compensation by the State of the economic consequences of the occurrence of unforeseen events for the suppliers. A descriptive statistical analysis is associated to a study of the doctrine that the State officials adress to contracting officers; a comparison of price determination provisions under American procurement and French law of “marchés publics” is then made. L'allocation des risques inhérents à l'exécution d'obligations dans des accords dont la temporalité est longue est une question importante, notamment pour l'économie. Or, à cet égard, il est significatif de constater que les entrées consacrées au droit administratif dans l'Encyclopedia of Law and Economics ne font pas mention des contrats administratifs, et que les entrées relatives au droit des contrats ne renvoient jamais au droit administratif. On ne peut que signaler, à ce propos, l'originalité de l'ouvrage de microéconomie des marchés publics et de la réglementation de J. -J Laffont et J. Tirole (1993). Quelles conclusions tirer de ce constat ? De notre point de vue, deux hypothèses peuvent être avancées : soit les économistes se désintéressent des contrats administratifs, soit ils les intègrent implicitement dans le même moule que les contrats de droit privé. Nous estimons que la deuxième hypothèse est la plus plausible, et nous souhaitons l'explorer ici en réfléchissant sur le fait de savoir si le droit positif des contrats privés et administratifs rend possible l'application de mêmes catégories d'analyse en matière d'allocation des risques. Cette question appelera naturellement une réflexion sur la signification et la portée empirique de la notion économique d'incomplétude des contrats...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} three transition countries (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) regarding four essential {{features of}} fiscal federalism: (a) the <b>administrative</b> <b>set-up,</b> (b) the {{tasks and functions}} allocated to sub-national governments, (c) revenue structure and fiscal autonomy, and (d) fiscal discipline. The practices in the three countries are analyzed for the period 2001 - 2013 mainly, and compared to practices in the EU- 28 at large. Compared to the EU average, fiscal disciplinary performance of the Baltic States (and of local governments) is adequate (and exemplary in Estonia). Tax autonomy of local governments is however very low in all three states; local governments rely heavily on their share in the personal income tax. The Baltic States differ significantly regarding their <b>administrative</b> <b>set-up,</b> but {{this is consistent with}} the huge variety in <b>administrative</b> <b>set-up</b> in Europe.

The overall absolute level of spending (in euro per inhabitant) by sub-national governments in the Baltic States is clearly below the EU-average. The shares of the main spending categories at sub-national level differ considerably from the EU-average. This is caused by specific choices regarding the division of tasks between local and central government (i. e. the result of relatively high or low levels of fiscal decentralization in certain policy fields) and/or general government differences (i. e. less or more spending in some policy fields in general) ...|$|E

40|$|With the {{collapse}} of the socialist regime in East Germany in late 1989 and the rising political call for unification in early 1990, a deep change of the institutional structure became necessary. The (agricultural) administration had to be totally restructured. This referred not only to substance, functions and tasks which had to be adjusted – similar to all other transition economies - to the market-economic and pluralistic democratic system, but also the whole <b>administrative</b> <b>set-up</b> had to be re-established in line with the West German system. Hence, a new administrative system had to be built up from scratch in the East, while the socialist one had to be dismantled in a short period. Overall, this institutional change seems to have been accomplished successfully as billions of Deutsch Mark could be processed by the agricultural administration in 1990 in order to avoid an imminent collapse of the agricultural sector. This administrative transformation was characterised by few rules, but a “pioneer spirit” among the staff involved which allowed a large degree of liberty in decision-making.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} the legality review of secondary rules in Italy. In {{the era of}} the vast administrative state there are numerous situations in which some activities are covered by rules emanating from government, departments of state or other governmental agencies. They are like a delegate is invited to stand in the shoes of the legislature. Governmental rules have two-fold nature. Regulations, on the one hand, are sources of law similar to primary legislation. On the other hand, secondary rules are administrative instruments that supplement the executive power, that is, they are an inherent feature of public authority. The twofold nature affects the legality review. Secondary rules may not be reviewed by the Constitutional Court. Although regulations are legislative instruments, their <b>administrative</b> <b>set-up</b> {{plays a key role in}} the application of procedural rules. Indeed, the judicial review of secondary rules is up to administrative courts, which can intervene mainly after a regulation is challenged. Because of this flexibility, administrative judicial proceedings are suitable for challenging regulations on account of the hybrid nature of regulations, which are halfway between legislative instruments and tools inherent in the exercise of public authority. The aim of this article is to demonstrate how administrative law courts seized with the review of regulations. The judicial review by administrative courts appears to be quite similar to that of the Constitutional Court, as it is modeled after an objective approach to jurisdiction. Judges must disapply regulations that infringe laws and they can adjust themselves to and admit of innovative approaches...|$|E

MethodsA prospective study over a 3 -month period at the AMAU, Aberdeen Royal Infirmary (ARI), a teaching hospital in north-eastern Scotland, was performed. The study included all patients started on empirical antibiotics on admission to the AMAU and followed up until their discharge. ResultsOf 1303 patients admitted, 221 (17 %) were started on empirical antibiotics. This was in accordance with hospital antibiotic policy in 52 % of cases. Appropriate specimens were taken from 77 % of patients. Culture results showed that 29 % (n = 65) of the patients had clinically significant growth of organisms. Of the 65 patients with clinically significant culture results, 49 % (n = 32) were on an inappropriate empirical regimen. In 55 %, the medication was not changed to a more appropriate antibiotic. In 72 % of the patients with a negative culture, the culture report had no obvious effect on the duration or type of antibiotic being administered. Intravenous antibiotics were used in 60 % of patients. ConclusionThis study demonstrates a significant overuse of antibiotics, especially intravenous forms, despite a paucity of positive sepsis parameters and chest X-ray findings in these patients The duration of treatment could be shortened and an early switch policy introduced if culture results and sepsis profiles were taken into consideration, as {{there was a large}} number of unproven infections.

40|$|Abstract Estimating {{the costs}} of health {{interventions}} is important to policy-makers {{for a number of}} reasons including the fact that the results can be used as a component in the assessment and improvement of their health system performance. Costs can, for example, be used to assess if scarce resources are being used efficiently or whether there is scope to reallocate them in a way that would lead to improvements in population health. As part of its WHO-CHOICE project, WHO has been developing a database on the overall costs of health interventions in different parts of the world as an input to discussions about priority setting. Programme costs, defined as costs incurred at the administrative levels outside the point of delivery of health care to beneficiaries, may comprise an important component of total costs. Cost-effectiveness analysis has sometimes omitted them if the main focus has been on personal curative interventions or on {{the costs of}} making small changes within the existing <b>administrative</b> <b>set-up.</b> However, this is not appropriate for non-personal interventions where programme costs are likely to comprise a substantial proportion of total costs, or for sectoral analysis where questions of how best to reallocate all existing health resources, including administrative resources, are being considered. This paper presents a first effort to systematically estimate programme costs for many health interventions in different regions of the world. The approach includes the quantification of resource inputs, choice of resource prices, and accounts for different levels of population coverage. By using an ingredients approach, and making tools available on the World Wide Web, analysts can adapt the programme costs reported here to their local settings. We report results for a selected number of health interventions and show that programme costs vary considerably across interventions and across regions, and that they can contribute substantially to the overall costs of interventions. </p...|$|E

However, the geo-physical fabric of Tharparkar features various ecological zones, which are different from the administrative set-up: Kha`ur, Kantho, Parker, Samroti, Vango, Vat, Muhrano and Dhat. Rainfall pattern is not uniform, ranges from 50 mm to 300 mm mostly in the monsoon season. There happens a drought often every four to five years. Rapid growth in population of human as well as animals has exerted pressures on water sources. Only 47 percent of the population has access to the drinking water source, 76 per cent of women travel average 3 km for fetching the water and consume 52 per cent of their working hours. Back ground-Ecological zones For administrative purposes, district of Tharparkar is divided into four talukas. However, the geo-physical fabric of Tharparkar features various ecological zones, which are different from the <b>administrative</b> <b>set-up.</b> The ecological zones have their own particular characteristics, which are described in ancient histories and folklore.

My initial interest in the Akie ‘Dorobo’ was motivated {{by the fact that}} they have constituted an almost blind spot on the ethnographic map of East Africa. In this study it will become apparent that the Akie have also been invisible in a political sense and subject to marginalization. Economic and social changes are explored within a wide historic frame, through a process of fitting and contesting different sources of data. My observations and insight acquired over twelve months among the Akie to the extreme south in Arusha Region in 1996 / 97 are revealing. Conceptual tools and frameworks of understanding evolve gradually in accordance with the presentation of material, in order to highlight aspects of {{economic and social}} transformation from different angles. An outline of Akie and ancient and pre-colonial history is proposed. Akie history does not begin with the coming of German and British colonialist from overseas. Changes in the Akie economy are explored in relation to external forces of push and pull, implications of colonial and post-independence policy and intervention, and how it has articulated on the local leve. The changes in the Akie economy has taken place through social and economic interaction in a shifting socio-political context of change. I have examined internals of the Akie economic system - described subsistence technology (including ideological components) and analyzed particular features of Akie social and economic organization, to try to explore further how the economic system may have changed - also over larger span of time. I have analyzed relations to neighbors, stigmatization and avoidance strategies. Focus is set on how the Akie have become muted in the land quest. Control over land and vital resources have been lost due to forces largely outside the Akie realm of influence. Land legislation is a part of this picture. The Akie vote with the feet even in the few cases they are represented on even the lowest levels of the modern <b>administrative</b> <b>set-up,</b> understandable in the light of their marginal influence, stigmatized status and previous negative experiences.

The first chapter of the study sketches out the existing system of TEVT, in terms of institutions, output and various trades which are being focussed upon by the system. <b>Administrative</b> <b>set-up</b> and the coordination mechanism is also briefly touched upon. Employability of the output produced by these institutions is discussed too. 	Using the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) of 1993 / 94, the size of the trained labour force is estimated and its pattern of employment by rural/urban and informal/formal is provided in the second chapter. The information of the survey is also utilised {{to assess the impact of}} training on the earnings of the individuals. In addition the influence of training on employability of trainee is examined. 	The third chapter contains discussion on recent initiatives of the government to enlist the participation of private sector in the TEVT System. The Skill Development Councils and their role is described. In addition the Government of Punjab's effort to expand technical and vocational education are discussed. 	The fourth chapter comprises of few case studies of the existing training institutions. Their influence on different aspects of industrial development of the area as well as meeting the skills need is described. These case studies pertain to Institute of Leather Technology Gujranwala, Pak-German Wood Working Centre Peshawar, and Metal Industrial Development Centre Sialkot. 	Competitiveness, Human Resource Development (HRD) and Future Challenges for Pakistan's economy are dealt in the fifth chapter. A brief discussion on the specifity of the type of technology used in the productive process of the economy and the effective use of HRD is made. The Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth of Pakistan's economy during the past fifty years is presented. Information on the unit labour cost is provided and compared with South and East Asian Countries. The changes in unit labour cost during 1970 - 92 are examined and factors underlying this change are identified. Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) analysis is presented to frame an idea about the products where Pakistan enjoys comparative advantage. Estimates pertaining to the possible effects of globalisation under WTO and post MFA scenario on employment generation are also presented. 	Final chapter while summarizing the study attempts to identify the major challenges facing the Pakistan's economy. The needed HRD efforts to address some of the issues are outlined.

40|$|In Afghanistan, {{the state}} {{building}} enterprise began by Amir Abdur Rehman Khan (r. 1880 - 1901) culminated into the 1964 constitution, {{seems to have}} created a sense of nationhood among the various groups making up the country. Despite {{the recent history of}} war and feud between various factions, {{there seems to be a}} consensus on preserving a united Afghanistan. This thesis attempts to examine the constitution making process in Afghanistan, especially in the context of relations between the central government and the periphery. If a constitution is 'the soul of a nation', as a South African scholar puts it, I am tempted to add that the constitution-making experience of a nation&# 8212;the constitutional moment is an occasion fora nation's self interrogation on its past, present and future. It is a rendezvous with destiny. Successful constitutions are characterized by a capacity to strike a balance between the need to enshrine fundamental principles, on the one hand, and provisions for adaptation to changing circumstances, on the other. The latter includes the needs of achieving Security an([the developmental imperatives of a nation. One of the crucial questions that the drafters of a constitution face concerns the relationship between the central government and the regions and localities comprising the country. What degree of decentralization is granted to the regions is a matter to be determined in each case by the history and politics of each country. Thus the present study advocating federalism in Afghanistan is divided into the following chapters:Chapter I discusses the established principles of constitutional Jurisprudence and its relevance in the context of the constitutional-making process in Afghanistan. Unitary constitution failed in delivering stability and development to Afghanistan, hence, needs application of federal principles. Chapter 2 describes and explains the ethnic diversity in Afghanistan. It also discusses the inter-ethnic relations in broader political ambit, policy of the ruling Muhammad zai dynasty towards ethnic minorities, inter-ethnic relations during Afghan Jihad and the subsequent impact of the jihad in terms of fostering ethnic rivalries. Chapter 3 contains a brief overview of the events leading to the fall of Communist regime in Kabul and efforts to install a multi-ethnic, broad-based government in Kabul under the auspices of the United Nations. The ensuing internecine battle for power, the power struggle amongst various contenders and its impact on the delicate social fabric of the Afghan society, role of regional as well as global powers in widening the schism amongst various interest groups distinguishable on ethnic, linguistic, sectarian and cultural grounds are taken into account. Five regional political power 			centers are identified. The rise and fall of the Taliban the interim and transitional governments mandated to restore democracy and constitutional order in Afghanistan are assessed. Chapter 4 narrates the story as to how the administrative edifice of Afghanistan was structured through the ages more precisely since the days of Amir Abdur Rehman, creator of the <b>administrative</b> <b>set-up</b> still in vogue in Afghanistan. The focus of attention has been the centre-periphery relations, the judicial structure, the military and the finances.

40|$|Leadership in {{an egalitarian}} {{society is a}} contradiction in terms. Still, a {{collective}} has to be vocal {{in order to gain}} a bargaining position, and to have its identity reflected and accepted. This is not the least true for a marginalised society like När socken, on the Swedish island of Gotland. In this farming community of some 550 inhabitants - as on Gotland in general - there are, in the conventional sense of the word, no leaders to perform this presentation. However, the concept of spokesperson is well established. They are locally defined by the use of labels, which in turn are based on descriptions or adjectives like "firebrand", "nay-sayer", "good", "balanced" etc. I propose that this way of defining spokespersons is founded on a strong egalitarian notion and is best described as a semantic field, rather than in hierarchical terms. Throughout the centuries the geographical and social base for the individual spokesperson has been the farm or ensamgård, i. e. a group of economically, jurally, ritually, as well as spatially linked homesteads. Thus, the socken of När may be described {{as an example of a}} house-based society. Successively these ensamgård have given place to more individual farms and these in turn have become linked directly with the socken as such. Presently the socken itself has ceased to exist, at least as a formal unit within the <b>administrative</b> <b>set-up</b> of Sweden. Nevertheless, locally När socken continues to act as the prime key organising symbol. As such, När socken forms the prime focus for the processes of identity formation and the most important forum for passing information, decision-making and implementation. On the one hand, the individual farms, with links of kinship, neighbourhood, co-operation, and co-ownership, constitute the basis for the formation of social ties within the socken. On the other, such ties are also established by popular participation in an astounding amount of voluntary associations as well as quite a few projects benefiting the community as a whole. These are undertakings that mobilise the absolute majority of the population. These processes have here been summarised as När’s socken-democracy. To the outsider the projects are the most obvious result of localised popular participation. From a local point of view these projects are, apart from being socially and economically significant, primarily regarded as sources of enjoyment - the satisfaction of which is considered in itself the single most important reason to participate in any collective social action. När socken is successfully represented as a thoroughly dynamic "modern" industrious and thriving community. At the same time it is regionally regarded as one of the most traditional Gotlandic farming socken with all the connotations of a warm-embracing but also somewhat backward, marginalised community. These rather contradictory rhetoric tools are successfully employed by the spokespersons as they, in unison, represent the community. However, the spokespersons of När socken are not a homogenous group with a single goal. Local solidarity obscures the fact that the presentation is based on a complex process. One can find strong urges among farmers/farms not only to be good enough (duga) but to excel at the cost of one’s neighbours, there is also a continuos competition to define what is to be the dominant local paradigm. This way of consciously devising rhetorics and keep a firm line between the community and the outside may be interpreted as a result of an expressed need to come to terms with political and economic, as well as moral marginalisation of the individual and community. Still, these rhetorics do not directly determine the ways in which the community members interact on När or vice versa. Everyday practices, be they socialising or engaging in a project, answer to a felt need to smoothen out everyday community life. The duality of a symbolically constructed rhetoric identity and local practice may be regarded as complementary ways to construct a viable collective identity in an increasingly individualised and globalised world. The combination of rhetoric and practice can be seen as answers to the expressed local concern as how to make life in the margin a feasible proposition...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{traces the}} development of public administration in Malawi from the pre-colonial period to the post-colonial period up to 2012, and finds that public administration in Malawi has spanned four epochs: the pre-colonial traditional African administration; the British Colonial Administration from 1891 to 1964; the post-colonial administration under the one party regime from 1964 to 1994; and the post-colonial administration under the multiparty democracy from 1994 to the present period, 2012. Of particular interest to the research are the major factors {{that have led to}} administrative change through this public administration spectrum, and how the changes have affected information and record keeping. The research seeks to establish the relationship that exists between administrative change and record keeping. The research finds that colonialism was a change factor which transformed the pre-colonial <b>administrative</b> <b>set-up</b> and its information keeping systems, and led to the establishment of the Western bureaucracy and record keeping systems modelled on those in Britain. The enactment of the Native Authority Ordinance in 1933 established Native Authorities, which comprised local chiefs and their councillors, as part of the local government. The establishment of the Native Authorities resulted in the establishment of record keeping systems that captured and maintained official records at local levels of government throughout the country. The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland as one of the remarkable administrative developments during the colonial period promoted records management programmes and led to the establishment of the National Archives in Malawi. As part of the administrative change in preparation for the transfer of power, the Treasury’s Organisation and Methods Unit reviewed and instituted new record keeping systems for government departments. Before the transfer of power, the research finds that the Colonial Administration exported some categories of records to London and ordered the destruction of certain categories of records held by District Commissioners throughout the country. Furthermore, the research finds that soon after the transfer of power, the new administration disregarded record keeping by repealing the Records Management regulations from the Malawi Public Service Regulations. This has been detrimental to public sector record keeping. Additionally, the one party government imposed controls on access to public archives by frequently closing the Archives, imposing lengthy and difficult access procedures, limiting areas for research, and using the Archives for intelligence surveillance. This thesis finds that, {{towards the end of the}} one party regime, some sensitive records were destroyed by the outgoing regime. After the attainment of democracy, the research finds that public archives were made widely and easily accessible, and that the public archives asumed a new meaning for ordinary people who had suffered from widespread attrocities during the one party regime. A number of governance reforms that have been undertaken have on the one hand, resulted in the promotion of records management and on the other hand, relied heavily on good record keeping for their successful implementation. Additionally, the research finds that technological developments have shaped the way in which the public sector generates and manages records today. Last, but not least, the research finds that implementation of some of the International Monetary Fund/World Bank policy reforms, such as privatisation of public enterprises, downsising, and freeze in public service employment, have impacted both positively and negatively on record keeping in Malawi. Likewise, implementation of the New Public Management policy reforms, such as commercialisation of the Staff Development Institute of Malawi, and compulsory competitive bidding in the public service, have had both positive and negative effects on record keeping. The research concludes that the developments that have taken place during all the four administrative epochs have had an immense bearing on record keeping, and therefore a direct relationship exists between administrative change and record keeping. Administrative change is responsible for shaping record keeping over a period of time and as long as administrative change occurs, record keeping will keep on developing in response. Although this is the case, good record keeping plays an important role in facilitating effective implementation of public sector reforms that result from administrative change. Citing Malawi as a case study, this thesis concludes that administrative change and public sector reforms provide a better context for understanding the history and development of record keeping in a country, than any other context because administrative change and public sector reforms are necessitated by the interaction of socio-political, economic and technological factors...|$|E
