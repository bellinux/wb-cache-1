25|$|Distinguished {{in figure}} and manners, Abelard was seen {{surrounded}} by crowds – {{it is said}} thousands of students – drawn from all countries by the fame of his teaching. Enriched by the offerings of his pupils, and entertained with universal admiration, he came, as he says, to think himself the only undefeated philosopher in the world. But a change in his fortunes was at hand. In his devotion to science, he had <b>always</b> <b>lived</b> a very regular life, enlivened only by philosophical debate: now, {{at the height of}} his fame, he encountered romance.|$|E
25|$|Giovanni Bellini {{was born}} in Venice. He {{was brought up in}} his father's house, and <b>always</b> <b>lived</b> and worked in the closest fraternal {{relation}} with his brother Gentile. Up until the age of nearly thirty we find in his work a depth of religious feeling and human pathos which is his own. His paintings from the early period are all executed in the old tempera method: the scene is softened by a new and beautiful effect of romantic sunrise color (as, for example, in the St. Jerome in the Desert).|$|E

25|$|Born in Giurgiu, {{the future}} Ion Vinea {{was the son}} of Alexandru Iovanaki and Olimpia (née Vlahopol-Constantinidi). Although, in adulthood, Vinea categorically denied his Greek ethnicity, both his parents were of {{documented}} Hellenic origins. Both also belonged to the upper strata: Alexandru, a nephew of Prince Careagdi (and his protegé, after Alexandru's parents committed suicide), took an engineer's diploma from the École Centrale, but <b>always</b> <b>lived</b> off on a country estate in Drăgănești; Olimpia, a classics teacher, was born to Graeco–Ottoman immigrants in Romania. According to one account, Ioan was Iovanaki's son in name only, conceived by Olimpia, a woman of outstanding beauty, with Henry C. Dundas, the British consul in Galați.|$|E

His second son Po Than Gyaung had gone underground in 1976 to join the Communists like his brother before him. U Hla's death at the age of 72, in August 1982, was unexpected by most who knew him as someone who had <b>always</b> <b>lived</b> a healthy life, although he developed diabetes later in life. He was suddenly taken ill just {{as he was about to}} be interviewed by a Japanese woman researcher accompanied by the writer Maung Tha-ya, rushed to hospital, and he died the same evening.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1811, the Shawnee leader Tecumseh {{gathered}} Indian {{tribes in}} an alliance {{to try to}} expel U.S. settlers from the Northwest area south of the Great Lakes. Tecumseh met the Choctaws to persuade them to join the alliance. Pushmataha, considered by historians {{to be the greatest}} Choctaw leader, countered Tecumseh's influence. As chief for the Six Towns (southern) district, Pushmataha strongly resisted such a plan, arguing that the Choctaw and their neighbors the Chickasaw had <b>always</b> <b>lived</b> in peace with European Americans, had learned valuable skills and technologies, and had received honest treatment and fair trade. The joint Choctaw-Chickasaw council voted against alliance with Tecumseh. On Tecumseh's departure, Pushmataha accused him of tyranny over his own Shawnee and other tribes. Pushmataha warned Tecumseh that he would fight against those who fought the United States.|$|E

500|$|The four {{wives of}} King Andriamasinavalona whose {{children}} were not chosen to rule {{one of the four}} districts of Imerina were assigned the noble sub-caste of [...] "Andriamasinavalona" [...] and transferred this ranking to their descendents. The king declared that members of this sub-caste would inhabit Ambatobevanja, at the southern limit of the neighborhood of Andohalo in Antananarivo, just outside the walls of the royal palace. Although not authorized to rule the kingdom, the Andriamasinavalona were deemed societal elders and gained the right to become [...] "masters of the fief" [...] (tompo-menakely) and construct tranomasina on their tombs. They were also assigned the honor of burying deceased sovereigns and carrying out sacrifices requested by the king. Outside of Antananarivo, the Zazamarolahy and the Andriamasinavalona settled throughout Imerina in the individual fiefs centered around the hill towns that they governed. In this way, nobles <b>always</b> <b>lived</b> in close proximity to the people they ruled, ensured their defense and provided for their livelihood.|$|E
500|$|The first {{peoples of}} the Kootenay River valley were the Ktunaxa people (often {{referred}} to as Kootenai) from whom the river's name derives. Ktunaxa creation myths state that their people were created by the Quilxka Nupika (supreme being) and have <b>always</b> <b>lived</b> in the region; one reads [...] "I have created you Kootenai people to look after this beautiful land, to honor and guard and celebrate my Creation here." [...] However, many historians {{believe that they are}} descended from Great Plains tribes that were driven out of their historic territory by the Blackfeet in the 16th century. The Ktunaxa are considered quite isolated from other Pacific Northwest and Great Plains tribes. Their language is an [...] "isolate", which is only distantly related (if at all) to the Salishan languages spoken by tribes of the Lake Pend d'-Oreille area. They were semi-nomadic people and inhabited a large area of the Kootenay valley from the headwaters to Kootenay Lake. Four villages provided their shelter in the winter, while {{in the rest of the}} year, they traveled between fishing, hunting and berry-picking areas. The northern Ktunaxa hunted buffalo, while the southerners mainly fished. Notably, the Ktunaxa were the first tribe west of the Rockies to capture and use feral European-introduced horses for their own use.|$|E
