5|$|Her father's {{business}} and political contacts helped John McCain to gain <b>a</b> <b>foothold</b> in Arizona politics. She campaigned with her husband door to door during his successful first bid for U.S. Congress in 1982, and was heavily involved in campaign strategy. Her wealth from an expired trust from her parents provided significant loans to the campaign and helped it survive a period of early debt.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-ninth century BC, Egypt made {{a failed}} attempt to once more gain <b>a</b> <b>foothold</b> in Western Asia. Osorkon II of Egypt, along with a large {{alliance}} of nations and peoples, including Persia, Israel, Hamath, Phoenicia/Canaan, the Arabs, Arameans, and neo Hittites among others, engaged in the Battle of Karkar against the powerful Assyrian king Shalmaneser III in 853BC. However, this coalition of powers failed and the Neo Assyrian Empire continued to dominate Western Asia.|$|E
5|$|On 10, 12 and 13 April, {{the lines}} {{held by the}} 104th Infantry in Bois Brule (near Apremont), and by the French to the left, were heavily {{attacked}} by the Germans. At first the enemy secured <b>a</b> <b>foothold</b> in some advanced trenches which were not strongly held, but sturdy counterattacks succeeded in driving the enemy out with serious losses, and the line was entirely re-established.|$|E

Many of them half believed the Great Manitou had come.|$|R
5|$|Projects in the United States {{during the}} late 1940s allowed Raymond to gain <b>a</b> <b>foothold</b> in {{occupied}} Japan. This helped to restart the building boom in occupied Japan after the war. This was mainly achieved through contacts made in his previous practice and those that he and Rado made in New York.|$|E
5|$|Stuart {{ended his}} 18-year stay in Britain and Ireland in 1793, leaving behind {{numerous}} unfinished paintings. He {{returned to the}} United States and settled briefly in New York City. In 1795, he moved to Germantown, Pennsylvania, near (and now part of) Philadelphia, where he opened a studio. It was here that he gained <b>a</b> <b>foothold</b> {{in the art world}} and lasting fame with pictures of many important Americans of the day.|$|E
5|$|The Jain {{philosophy}} and literature have contributed immensely {{to the religious}} and cultural landscape of Karnataka. Islam, which had an early presence {{on the west coast}} of India as early as the tenth century, gained <b>a</b> <b>foothold</b> in Karnataka with the rise of the Bahamani and Bijapur sultanates that ruled parts of Karnataka. Christianity reached Karnataka in the sixteenth century {{with the arrival of the}} Portuguese and St. Francis Xavier in 1545.|$|E

5|$|Tresco {{formed a}} base for Royalist privateers, and Parliament became {{concerned}} that the Dutch, then hostile to England, might counter the piracy by occupying the islands, gaining <b>a</b> <b>foothold</b> they could then use against England.

5|$|Varsity {{was part}} of Operation Plunder, the Anglo-American-Canadian assault under Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery to cross the {{northern}} Rhine River and from there enter Northern Germany. Varsity was meant to help the surface river assault troops secure <b>a</b> <b>foothold</b> across the Rhine River in Western Germany by landing two airborne divisions on the eastern bank of the Rhine {{near the village of}} Hamminkeln and the town of Wesel.|$|E
5|$|After Gebhard's expulsion, Ernst assumed full {{charge of}} the Electorate of Cologne. In his later years, a nuncio at Cologne took {{responsibilities}} for the financial administration of the archdiocese, and Ernst's nephew, Ferdinand of Bavaria, {{was elected to the}} Cathedral Chapter, the Wittelsbach heir-apparent. When Ernst died in 1612, the Cathedral Chapter duly elected his nephew to the position and Wittelsbachs held the Electorate until 1761. Ernst's victory, both in winning the election in 1583, and in convincing the assembly of other electors to accept him in 1585, confirmed him as the new archbishop of Cologne and gave the Wittelsbach family <b>a</b> <b>foothold</b> on the northern Rhine.|$|E

5|$|In May 2007, Griffin {{was invited}} to address {{a meeting at the}} University of Bath by {{politics}} student and BNP youth leader Danny Lake. Lake wanted Griffin to visit the university and explain the BNP's policies to lecturers and students. The invitation was viewed by some as an attempt by the party to establish <b>a</b> <b>foothold</b> on the university campus. Eleven union general secretaries wrote to the university's vice-chancellor and asked her to reconsider the decision to allow the meeting. A large protest was planned, and following students' concerns over their personal safety, the University cancelled the invitation.|$|E
5|$|Model {{believed}} that the situation represented not just a threat, but also an opportunity to counter-attack and possibly clear the Allies out of the Southern Netherlands. Towards this end, he forbade SS General Willi Bittrich and SS Lieutenant General Heinz Harmel, commanding II SS Panzer Corps and 10th SS Panzer respectively, from destroying the Nijmegen bridge. With the exception of this tactical error, Model is considered to have fought an outstanding battle and handed the Allies a sharp defeat. The bridge at Arnhem was held and the 1st Airborne Division destroyed, dashing the Allies' hopes for <b>a</b> <b>foothold</b> over the Rhine {{before the end of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|Nathu La {{played a}} vital role in the 1903–1904 British {{expedition}} to Tibet, which sought to prevent the Russian Empire from interfering in Tibetan affairs and thus gaining <b>a</b> <b>foothold</b> in the region. In 1904, Major Francis Younghusband, serving as the British Commissioner to Tibet, led a successful mission through Nathu La to capture Lhasa. This led to the setting up of trading posts at Gyantse and Gartok in Tibet, and gave control of the surrounding Chumbi Valley to the British. The following November, China and Great Britain ratified an agreement approving trade between Sikkim and Tibet.|$|E

5|$|Oliver's Battery {{was built}} in the interregnum {{following}} the English Civil War. The Isles of Scilly had supported Charles I during the conflict between 1642 and 1646, and, after a short period in Parliamentary control, the islands rebelled in favour of Charles in 1648. The islands became a base for Royalist privateers, and Parliament became concerned that the Dutch, then hostile to England, might counter the piracy by occupying the islands, gaining <b>a</b> <b>foothold</b> that they could then use against England. In 1651 Parliament sent Sir Robert Blake in charge of a naval task force to retake the islands.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{failed to}} achieve any of their goals on the first day. Carentan, St. Lô, and Bayeux {{remained}} in German hands, and Caen, a major objective, was not captured until 21 July. Only two of the beaches (Juno and Gold) were linked on the first day, and all five beachheads were not connected until 12 June; however, the operation gained <b>a</b> <b>foothold</b> which the Allies gradually expanded over the coming months. German casualties on D-Day have been estimated at 4,000 to 9,000 men. Allied casualties were at least 10,000, with 4,414 confirmed dead.|$|E

5|$|The Sunbeam was {{originally}} conceived by Chrysler as a stopgap model, developed {{to keep the}} Linwood works running—it {{was based on the}} running gear of the earlier Avenger made there—while helping the company to maintain <b>a</b> <b>foothold</b> in the growing small car market. Aware that a more modern design was needed to compete with upcoming front-wheel drive rivals, Chrysler undertook some development work on a shortened version of the Chrysler Horizon (which had the development code C2), dubbed C2-short, but it was cut short by the company's financial problems and plans to divest Chrysler Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{figure of}} St. Ninian, {{traditionally}} credited with introducing Christianity {{to the region}} of south-west Scotland, is now widely regarded as a later construct {{and may have been}} the result of scribal confusion with the Irish saint Finnian. The church known as Candida Casa was dedicated to him at Whithorn in the sixth century and from there St Kentigern seems to have created a new centre of worship at Govan or Inchinnan, which would extend an influence across the Strathclyde region. However, it is clear that Christianity had already gained <b>a</b> <b>foothold</b> across what is now southern Scotland before the sixth century.|$|E
5|$|The game sold a {{total of}} 300,000 units for the ZX Spectrum and {{generated}} £1 million in revenue for Ultimate Play the Game, which enabled the Stamper brothers to gain <b>a</b> <b>foothold</b> in the early video gaming market. After the game's release, Jetpac was parodied in a long-running Crash comic strip named Lunar Jetman. The strip, designed by John Richardson, lasted from July 1984 to October 1991 and gained popular reception from readers. To develop the comic, photographs had to be processed manually on a photo-mechanical tone and then transferred to paper, later being fully colourised in the late 1980s.|$|E
