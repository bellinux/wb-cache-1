5|$|Discussion of damming the White River for {{flood control}} {{began in the}} 1930s, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (CoE) held {{hearings}} on building a dam in January 1946. The new dam would create a lake 50miles (80km) long, and one arm would extend to Monte Ne. Work on Beaver Dam began in 1960 as the CoE impounded and bought land <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> River. In July 1962, Mary Powell sold Camp Joyzelle to the CoE, and W. T. McWhorten sold his land as well.|$|E
5|$|The rook is {{then used}} to support a piece attack against White's castled King. Black can easily get several pieces <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> king, notably a rook to h6, a queen to h4 and a knight on g4. The queen's arrival on the h4-square is {{facilitated}} {{by the absence of}} a white knight on the f3-square (that would otherwise cover the h4-square) and of a black knight on the f6-square (that would block the way for the black queen). If White tries to defend with h2–h3, this may allow the Bc8 to be sacrificed at h3 in order to open the h-file.|$|E

5|$|While {{administering}} England for Rufus, Ranulf also supervised construction projects. Under his management, {{the first}} stone bridge in London was constructed. Ranulf also built a wall <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Tower in London, enclosing the inner ward. A new hall at Westminster was also built, {{of which the}} outside walls of Westminster Hall are still surviving. He started building the church at Christchurch at Twynham, {{which he had been}} granted by Rufus. After Rufus' death, the church was confiscated from Ranulf, and building work ceased. The crypts and transepts of the current church, however, date from Ranulf's construction work.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in the future, IK Pegasi A will consume the {{hydrogen}} fuel at its core and start to evolve away from the main sequence to form a red giant. The envelope of a red giant can grow to significant dimensions, extending up to a hundred times its previous radius (or larger). Once IK Pegasi A expands to the point where its outer envelope overflows the Roche lobe of its companion, a gaseous accretion disk will form <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> dwarf. This gas, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, will then accrete onto the surface of the companion. This mass transfer between the stars will also cause their mutual orbit to shrink.|$|E
5|$|While RR Telescopii, also {{designated}} Nova Telescopii 1948, {{is often}} called a slow nova, it is now classified as a symbiotic nova system composed of an M5III pulsating red giant and a white dwarf; between 1944 and 1948 it brightened by about 7 magnitudes before being noticed at apparent magnitude 6.0 in mid-1948. It has since faded slowly to about apparent magnitude 12. QS Telescopii is a binary system composed of a white dwarf and main sequence donor star, {{in this case the}} two are close enough to be tidally locked, facing one another. Known as polars, material from the donor star does not form an accretion disk <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> dwarf, but rather streams directly onto it. This is due to the presence of the white dwarf's strong magnetic field.|$|E

5|$|Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, {{all of the}} British Isles came {{to abandon}} its former Mesolithic {{hunter-gatherer}} lifestyle, {{to be replaced by}} the new agricultural subsistence of the Neolithic Age. Although a common material culture was shared throughout most of the British Isles in this period, there was great regional variation regarding the nature and distribution of settlement, architectural styles, and the use of natural resources. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic way of life. Although witnessing some land clearance, Britain was largely forested in this period, and it is unclear what level of deforestation the area of Kent had experienced in the Early Neolithic; widespread forest clearance only took place on the chalklands of south-east Britain in the Late Bronze Age. Environmental data from the area <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Horse Stone supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Maloideae.|$|E
5|$|The {{innermost}} ward encloses an area immediately {{south of}} the White Tower, stretching to {{what was once the}} edge of the River Thames. As was the case at other castles, such as the 11th-century Hen Domen, the innermost ward was probably filled with timber buildings from the Tower's foundation. Exactly when the royal lodgings began to encroach from the White Tower into the innermost ward is uncertain, although it had happened by the 1170s. The lodgings were renovated and elaborated during the 1220s and 1230s, becoming comparable with other palatial residences such as Windsor Castle. Construction of Wakefield and Lanthorn Towers– located at the corners of the innermost ward's wall along the river– began around 1220. They probably served as private residences for the queen and king respectively. The earliest evidence for how the royal chambers were decorated comes from HenryIII's reign: the queen's chamber was whitewashed, and painted with flowers and imitation stonework. A great hall existed in the {{south of the}} ward, between the two towers. It was similar to, although slightly smaller than, that also built by HenryIII at Winchester Castle. Near Wakefield Tower was a postern gate which allowed private access to the king's apartments. The innermost ward was originally surrounded by a protective ditch, which had been filled in by the 1220s. Around this time, a kitchen was built in the ward. Between 1666 and 1676, the innermost ward was transformed and the palace buildings removed. The area <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Tower was cleared so that anyone approaching would have to cross open ground. The Jewel House was demolished, and the Crown Jewels moved to Martin Tower.|$|E

25|$|Back in 1973, Wolverine {{contacts}} Xavier and Beast then recruit Quicksilver {{to release}} the young Magneto from his prison underneath the Pentagon, {{where he had been}} captive since 1963 for his apparent role in the assassination of John F. Kennedy and of which he kept maintaining his innocence. Magneto helps them stop Mystique from killing Trask at the Paris Peace Accords but then decides to take matters at his own. He laces the prototype Sentinels with steel to be able to control them, commandeers the Sentinels at their White House unveiling to attack the crowd, then sets the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House as a barricade. Using his powers, Magneto pulls the safe room out of the White House, makes a speech at the television cameras regarding mutant superiority, and prepares to kill President Richard Nixon and his cabinet. Afterward, Nixon turns out to be Mystique in disguise who shoots Magneto in the neck. Magneto is labeled a mutant terrorist for his attack against Nixon and the world leaders unite to hunt him down. His actions also demonstrate the threat the Sentinels pose if they are in the wrong hands and used against people, becomes one of the contributing factors that lead to the cancellation of the Sentinel program and averting the dystopian future.|$|E

500|$|Anne Boleyn was {{beheaded}} in 1536 for treason against Henry VIII; her ghost supposedly haunts {{the chapel}} of St Peter ad Vincula, {{where she is}} buried, and has been said to walk <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Tower carrying her head under her arm. This haunting is commemorated in the 1934 comic song [...] "With Her Head Tucked Underneath Her Arm". Other reported ghosts include Henry VI, Lady Jane Grey, Margaret Pole, and the Princes in the Tower. In January 1816, a sentry on guard outside the Jewel House claimed to have witnessed an apparition of a bear advancing towards him, and reportedly died of fright a few days later. In October 1817, a tubular, glowing apparition was {{claimed to have been}} seen in the Jewel House by the Keeper of the Crown Jewels, Edmund Lenthal Swifte.

500|$|RZ Gruis is {{a binary}} system of {{apparent}} magnitude 12.3 with occasional dimming to 13.4, whose components—a white dwarf and main sequence star—are thought to orbit each other roughly every 8.5 to 10 [...] hours. It {{belongs to the}} UX Ursae Majoris subgroup of cataclysmic variable star systems, where material from the donor star is drawn to the white dwarf where it forms an accretion disc that remains bright and outshines the two component stars. The system is poorly understood, though the donor star has been calculated to be of spectral type F5V. These stars have spectra very similar to novae that have returned to quiescence after outbursts, yet {{they have not been}} observed to have erupted themselves. The American Association of Variable Star Observers recommends watching them for future events. CE Gruis (also known as Grus V-1) is a faint (magnitude 18–21) star system also composed of a white dwarf and donor star; in this case the two are so close they are tidally locked. Known as polars, material from the donor star does not form an accretion disc <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> dwarf, but rather streams directly onto it.|$|E
500|$|In 1950, Plath {{attended}} Smith College and excelled academically. She {{wrote to}} her mother, [...] "The world is splitting open at my feet like a ripe, juicy watermelon". She edited The Smith Review and during the summer after her third year of college was awarded a coveted position as guest editor at Mademoiselle magazine, during which she spent a month in New York City. The experience was not what she had hoped it would be, and it began a downward spiral. She was furious at not being at a meeting the editor had arranged with Welsh poet Dylan Thomas—a writer whom she loved, said one of her boyfriends, [...] "more than life itself." [...] She hung <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Horse Tavern and the Chelsea Hotel for two days, hoping to meet Thomas, {{but he was already}} on his way home. A few weeks later, she slashed her legs to see if she had enough [...] "courage" [...] to commit suicide. Many of the events that took place during that summer were later used as inspiration for her novel The Bell Jar. During this time she was refused admission to the Harvard writing seminar. Following electroconvulsive therapy for depression, Plath made her first medically documented suicide attempt in late August 1953 by crawling under her house and taking her mother's sleeping pills.|$|E
500|$|On July 19, 2014, {{police in}} Northwest Virginia {{received}} calls regarding a reckless driver, and then observed a Ford Bronco travelling at high speed. Gonzalez initially tried to flee after troopers {{tried to make}} him pull over; he drove his vehicle off the road into a highway median. After searching his vehicle, police found a sawed-off shotgun, two rifles and four handguns, as well as ammunition and a tomahawk. They also found a map of Washington, D.C. with a circle drawn <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House. Gonzalez was arrested for eluding police and possessing a sawed-off shotgun. He said he failed to stop because he had an [...] "Iraqi moment": a [...] "flashback" [...] that was triggered by the lights and sirens of the police car. Virginian police informed both the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Secret Service about the arrest. Secret Service agents subsequently interviewed Gonzalez though he was deemed {{not to be a}} threat. On August 25, Secret Service agents approached Gonzalez at the White House fence after noticing a small hatchet in his waistband. Agents searched his car and found two dogs, two more hatchets, camping equipment, and empty gun cases, though no guns or ammunition. Secret Service agents interviewed Gonzalez again; they were aware that he had been interviewed by other agents the previous month. He was still deemed to not be a threat.|$|E
