40|$|The {{representation}} of the CFSv 2 ocean-atmosphere ensemble hindcasts is investigated during Dec-Jan-Feb (DJF) and Jun-Jul-Aug (JJA) from 1983 to 2010. The skill anomaly correlations showed that in some continents the forecasts do not have dependency with changes in the initial conditions. Also, in both seasons the model has a higher skill at the 0 -month lead time with the largest spatial biases occurring over the North America, South America, and Oceania. Over the continents the largest biases in the nonlinearity of El Ni˜no minus La Ni˜na events are found over the eastern South Africa, part of Oceania, and central-southeastern parts of South America. During DJF the main biases are related to double-ITCZ, strengthening of SPCZ, and deepening of the Aleutian and Icelandic low pressures. The simulation of a warmer SST on the eastern of most <b>austral</b> <b>oceans,</b> the strengthening (weakening) of the Subtropical (Polar) Jet over the Southern Hemisphere, and the weakening of the zonal circulation near the Antarctic continent are also found in both seasons.

40|$|Premise of the study: The broad austral {{distribution}} of Schoeneae {{is almost certainly}} a product of long-distance dispersal. Owing to the inadequacies of existing phylogenetic data {{and a lack of}} rigorous biogeographic analysis, relationships within the tribe remain poorly resolved and its pattern of radiation and dispersal uncertain. We employed an expanded sampling of taxa and markers and a rigorous analytic approach to address these limitations. We evaluated the roles of geography and ecology in stimulating the initial radiation of the group and its subsequent dispersal across the southern hemisphere. • Methods: A dated tree was reconstructed using reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with a polytomy prior and molecular dating, applied to data from two nuclear and three cpDNA regions. Ancestral areas and habitats were inferred using dispersal–extinction–cladogenesis models. • Key results: Schoeneae originated in Australia in the Paleocene. The existence of a “hard” polytomy {{at the base of the}} clade reflects the rapid divergence of six principal lineages ca. 50 Ma, within Australia. From this ancestral area, Schoeneae have traversed the <b>austral</b> <b>oceans</b> with remarkable frequency, a total of 29 distinct dispersal events being reported here. Dispersal rates between landmasses are not explicable in terms of the geographical distances separating them. Transoceanic dispersal generally involved habitat stasis. • Conclusions: Although the role of dispersal in explaining global distribution patterns is now widely accepted, the apparent ease with which such dispersal may occur has perhaps been under-appreciated. In Schoeneae, transoceanic dispersal has been remarkably frequent, with ecological opportunity, rather than geography, being most important in dictating dispersal patterns...|$|R

40|$|The Crozet Bank, the easternmost {{region of}} the Crozet Plateau (<b>austral</b> Indian <b>Ocean),</b> is capped by two gropus of islands which form the Crozet Archipelago (Terres Australes and Antarctiques Françaises). A N-S-trending 2 km deep basin, the Indivat Basin, extends {{between the two groups}} of islands and bisects the Crozet Bank into two {{separate}} domains. The interpretation of the KeOBS 8 seismic refraction profile shot during the KeOBS/MD 66 cruise (January-February 1991) over the eastern Crozet Plateau was carried out by ray tracing and the computation of synthetic seismograms. This interpretation leads to a rather complex seismic structure and outlines a pronounced eastward crustal thinning from 16. 5 to 10 km at the expense of layer 2. The thinning of the crust is abrupt east of the Indivat Basin. Unlike below the Hawaiian Islands and the Marquesas Islands, no underplated mantle material underlies the crust of the Crozet Bank. Moreover, this deep seismic sounding has further revealed tha high-velocity outcropping the seabed 30 km east of Ile aux Cochons could be a major structural feature, deeply rooted withn he lower crust. The occurrence of this feature (a submarine volcano ?) is associated with a mantle dyke causing a steep shallowing of the lower crustal interfaces. Gravity modelling was performed along line KeOBS 8, with a density structure deduced from the seismic section, to model free-air anomalies derived from altimetry data. This modelling confirms that the Indivat Basin, underlined by a gravity low running roughly N-S between the two groups of islands, is a major structural boundary. As the model generates medium-wavelength anomalies of adequate amplitude, it also confirms that the volcano, located west of the Indivat Basin, is a deeply rooted feature. The Crozet Bank clearly appears as a plume-affected structure, which may have originated from a deep thermal anomaly within the lithsophere [...] . (D'après résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|The last interglacial (LIG) is {{characterized}} by high latitude warming and is therefore often considered as a possible analogue for future warming. However, in contrast to predicted future greenhouse warming, the last interglacial climate is largely governed by variations in insolation. Greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations were relatively stable and similar to pre-industrial values, {{with the exception of}} the early last interglacial where GHGs were slightly lower. We performed six time-slice simulations with the low resolution version of the Norwegian Earth System Model covering the last interglacial. In four simulations only orbital forcing was changed, and in two simulations additionally GHG forcing was reduced to values appropriate for the early last interglacial. Our simulations show that insolation forcing results in seasonal and hemispheric differences in temperature. In contrast, a reduction in greenhouse gas forcing causes a global and seasonal-independent cooling. We also compare our modelled results to proxy data extracted from four marine sediment cores covering the entire last interglacial along a northeast-southwest transect in the North Atlantic. Our modelled North Atlantic summer sea surface temperatures capture the general trend of the proxy summer temperatures, with low values in the early last interglacial, a peak around 125 ka, and a steady decrease towards the end of the last interglacial. Temperatures computed by the simulations with reduced GHG forcing improve the fit as they show lower temperatures in the early last interglacial. Furthermore we show that the timing of maximum surface temperatures follows the local insolation maximum. Two exceptions are the temperatures on Antarctica that show maxima at both ~ 130 ka and ~ 115 ka, and the Southern <b>Ocean</b> <b>austral</b> summer temperatures that peak early at ~ 130 ka. This is probably due to the integrating effect of the ocean, storing summer heat and resulting in relatively warm winter temperatures...|$|R

In order to better understand their potential sources and sinks over the Southern Indian <b>Austral</b> <b>Ocean,</b> shipborne measurements of selected species were made during the MANCHOT campaign during December 2004, on board the research vessel Marion Dufresne. Along the transect La Réunion to Kerguelen Island, air measurements of selected VOC (including dimethylsulfide (DMS) isoprene, carbonyls and organohalogens), carbon monoxide and ozone were performed, crossing subtropical, temperate and sub-Antarctic waters as well as pronounced subtropical and sub-Antarctic oceanic fronts. The remote marine boundary layer was characterised at latitudes 45 - 50 °S. Oceanic fronts were associated with enhanced chlorophyll and biological activity in the seawater and elevated DMS and organohalogens in the atmosphere.

40|$|International audienceUnderstanding {{the effects}} of {{environmental}} variations on ecosystems is a major topic in ecology. In this study, we estimated demographic parameters of a seabird population, the thin-billed prion (Pachyptila belcheri) at Kerguelen Islands, and then tested for relationships with inter-annual variations of climatic indices, using long-term capture–recapture data. The annual adult survival probability was 0. 825 ± 0. 009 and the breeding success was 0. 519 ± 0. 090. Sea surface temperature anomalies were negatively related with breeding success. By contrast, winter sea ice concentration in the Antarctic seasonal ice zone seemed to negatively influence adult survival. This suggests a connection between sub-Antarctic and Antarctic ecosystems. The actual context of large climatic changes in the <b>Austral</b> <b>Ocean</b> seems to explain {{a large part of}} the decreasing trends observed for both the breeding success and the adult survival.

40|$|The Southern Ocean {{is largely}} a High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll (HNLC) region where {{macronutrient}} concentrations are high and phytoplankton productivity is low. However, there are productive ‘hot spots’ that sustain large phytoplankton blooms. These areas, maintained by natural iron (Fe) fertilization, are important for the Southern Ocean ecosystem and for driving carbon export. Fe addition on-deck bioassay experiments were conducted on two cruises to the Scotia Sea region of the Southern <b>Ocean</b> (<b>austral</b> spring 2006 and summer 2008) to better understand how Fe controls the microplankton (20 – 200 ?m) community structure on a seasonal basis. Light microscopy and fast-repetition rate fluorometry were used to examine changes in the species composition and physiological status of the microplankton community. Bioassays were carried out in three contrasting regions of the Scotia Sea: (1) a naturally Fe-fertilized, high chlorophyll area downstream (north and northwest) of the Islands of South Georgia (DSG); (2) a low Fe, low chlorophyll area upstream (south) of the Islands of South Georgia (USG); and (3) a naturally Fe-fertilized area north of the South Orkney Islands (SOI). Multivariate statistics were applied to the light microscopy results, showing {{significant differences between the}} initial microplankton communities for each of the bioassays. These differences were primarily spatial (between regions) and secondarily temporal (between seasons). Significant microplankton community shifts occurred in three of five bioassays, those in spring and summer USG and in summer DSG only. In summer, USG community responses increased significantly in medium (100 – 1000 pg C cell? 1) and large (> 1000 pg C cell? 1) diatom species in response to Fe addition. Such a response was consistent with relief from in situ Fe limitation, which favours larger microplankton species with higher Fe requirements and subject to lower grazing pressures. The largest biomass increase in Fe-treated bioassay bottles was in Pseudonitzschia spp., which suggests that this genus may be a particularly important member of the microplankton community in the Scotia Sea...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the {{ecological}} role of the euthecosome pteropod, Limacina retroversa, in particular, and the mesozooplankton community, in general, in the pelagic ecosystem of the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ), Southern Ocean. Data were collected from four oceanographic surveys to the Indian sector of the PFZ during austral autumn 2000, 2002, 2004 and 2005. Copepods, mainly Calanus simillimus, Oithona similis, Clausocalanus spp. and Ctenocalanus spp., typically dominated total mesozooplankton counts, accounting for, on average, between 75. 5 % and 88. 1 % (Mean = 77. 4 %; SD = 13. 4 %) of the total, during the present investigation. Results of the study indicate that L. retroversa may, at times, contribute substantially to total mesozooplankton abundances. During the study, L. retroversa contributed between 0. 0 and 30. 0 % (Mean = 5. 3 %; SD = 7. 1 %) to total mesozooplankton numbers. Significant small-scale variability in abundance and size structure of L. retroversa and abundance of copepods was minimal. Inter-annual variability, on the other hand, was significant between some years. Total pteropod numbers were greatest during April 2002 and 2004, while copepods exhibited greatest abundances during April 2004 only. Pearson’s Correlation analysis suggested that L. retroversa abundances were positively correlated to total surface chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations. The significantly lower chl-a concentrations recorded during April 2005 may explain the reduced pteropod numbers observed during that survey. The size class structure of L. retroversa comprised mainly small and mediumsized individuals during all four surveys. This corresponds well with records from the northern hemisphere (sub-Arctic and Arctic waters) where Limacina spp. are reported to exhibit maximum spawning during mid to late-summer. Higher abundances of large individuals only occurred during April 2005, when chl-a concentrations were very low; possibly the result of delayed spawning, due to reduced food availability. Ingestion rates of the four most abundant copepods, determined using the gut fluorescence technique, ranged between 159. 32 ng (pigm) ind⁻¹ day⁻¹ and 728. 36 ng (pigm) ind⁻¹ day⁻¹ (Mean = 321. 01 ng (pigm) ind⁻¹ day⁻¹; SD = 173. 91 ng (pigm) ind⁻¹ day). Ingestion rates of L. retroversa were much higher, ranging from an average of 4 28. 68 ng (pigm) ind⁻¹ day⁻¹ in April 2002 to 4 196. 88 ng (pigm) ind⁻¹day⁻¹in April 2005 (Mean = 4157. 36 ng (pigm) ind⁻¹ day⁻¹; SD = 35. 37 ng (pigm) ind⁻¹day⁻¹). Average daily grazing rates for the pteropod varied between 0. 39 mg (pigm) m⁻² day⁻¹ in April 2005 and 17. 69 mg (pigm) m- 2 day- 1 in April 2004 (Mean = 6. 13 mg (pigm) m⁻² day⁻¹; SD = 11. 04 mg (pigm) m⁻² day⁻¹); corresponding average daily grazing impacts ranged between 8. 4 % and 139. 8 % of the phytoplankton standing stock in April 2005 and 2004, respectively (Mean = 48. 5 %; SD = 84. 5 %). Average daily grazing rates of the four copepods ranged from 4. 58 mg (pigm) m⁻² day⁻¹ to 8. 77 mg (pigm) m⁻² day⁻¹ - 1, during April 2002 and 2004, respectively (Mean = 6. 28 mg (pigm) m⁻² day⁻¹; SD = 5. 94 mg (pigm) m⁻² day⁻¹). Collectively, the copepods removed an average of between 31. 6 % and 89. 8 % of the phytoplankton standing stock per day, during April 2002 and 2004, respectively (Mean = 70. 8 %; SD = 86. 7 %). The daily grazing impact of the copepods accounted for an average of between 40. 4 % and 87. 8 % of the total zooplankton grazing impact, during April 2004 and 2005, respectively (Mean = 75. 0 %; SD = 65. 5 %). L. retroversa was responsible for an average of 52. 4 % and 59. 5 % of the total zooplankton grazing impact, during April 2002 and 2004, respectively. However, during April 2005, when L. retroversa numbers were significantly lower than previous years, the pteropod contributed an average of only 7. 5 % to the total zooplankton grazing impact. Thus, during the present investigation,the pteropod was responsible for removing a mean of 48. 9 % of the available phytoplankton (SD = 74. 9 %). The predation impact of the dominant carnivorous macrozooplankton and micronekton in the PFZ was determined during April 2004 and 2005 using daily ration estimates obtained from the literature. Additionally, gut content analysis was used to determine the contribution of L. retroversa to the diet of the dominant predators. Average predation impact ranged from 1. 1 % and 5. 7 % of the total mesozooplankton standing stock during April 2004 and 2005, respectively (Mean = 3. 8 %; SD = 12. 3 %). Chaetognaths and euphausiids dominated total carnivore numbers and made the greatest contributions to total predation impact during both years. Copepods appeared to be the main prey item of the dominant carnivorous macrozooplankton-micronekton in the region. L. retroversa was only detected in the gut contents of the amphipod, Themisto gaudichaudi, but not in either of the chaetognath species (Eukrohnia hamata and Sagitta gazellae) or the myctophid fish (Electrona spp.). The pteropod was found in 19 % of amphipod guts dissected. Pearson’s Correlation analyses showed that the four major predatory zooplankton groups found in the PFZ (chaetognaths, euphausiids, amphipods and myctophid fish) were positively correlated to abundances of L. retroversa, suggesting that the pteropod might be an important prey item for many of the carnivorous macrozooplankton/micronekton in the PFZ. To conclude, L. retroversa may play an important role in the pelagic ecosystem of the PFZ, in <b>austral</b> autumn. However, <b>ocean</b> acidification and calcium carbonate undersaturation (as a result of increased anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions), that is predicted to occur within the next 50 – 100 years, will most likely have significant implications for the Sub-Antarctic pelagic ecosystem if L. retroversa cannot adapt quickly enough to the changes...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparative}} thermal tolerance {{study was}} undertaken on two sister species of Euphausiids (Antarctic krills) Euphausia superba and Euphausia crystallorophias. Both are essential {{components of the}} Southern Ocean ecosystem, but occupy distinct environmental geographical locations with slightly different temperature regimes. They therefore provide a useful model system for the investigation of adaptations to thermal tolerance. Initial CTmax studies showed that E. superba was slightly more thermotolerant than E. crystallorophias. Five Hsp 70 mRNAs were characterized from the RNAseq data of both species and subsequent expression kinetics studies revealed notable differences in induction {{of each of the}} 5 orthologues between the two species, with E. crystallorophias reacting more rapidly than E. superba. Furthermore, analyses conducted to estimate the evolutionary rates and selection strengths acting on each gene tended to support the hypothesis that diversifying selection has contributed to the diversification of this gene family, and led to the selective relaxation on the inducible C form with its possible loss of function in the two krill species. The sensitivity of the epipelagic species E. crystallorophias to temperature variations and/or its adaptation to cold is enhanced when compared with its sister species, E. superba.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of air bubbles trapped in polar ice permits {{the reconstruction of}} atmospheric evolution of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO 2), on various timescales. Within this study, the simultaneous {{analysis of}} the CO 2 mixing ratio and its stable carbon isotope composition (&# 948; 13 CO 2) {{over the last two}} deglaciations allows us to better constrain the global carbon cycle. Based on the different isotopic signatures of the ocean and the terrestrial biosphere (major reservoirs responsible for the CO 2 oscillations on a glacial interglacial scale), &# 948; 13 CO 2 contributes in distinguishing the major sources of CO 2 for the studied periods. The new LGGE analytical method applied to samples from the EPICA / Dome C ice core provides a 1 -sigma uncertainty over 3 measurements on the same extracted gas of 0. 98 and 1. 87 ppmv for CO 2, for the last and penultimate deglaciation respectively, accompanied by an averaged 0. 1 1 -sigma for &# 948; 13 CO 2 for both periods. This allows us to reveal signi&# 64257;cant changes in the signal through time. The time resolution of our results (&# 8764; 250 and &# 8764; 730 years, for last and penultimate deglaciation) allows us to divide Terminations (T) into sub-periods, based on the different slope of CO 2 rate of changes. The &# 8764; 80 ppmv CO 2 increase throughout TI, coherent with previously published studies, is accompanied by a &# 8764; 0. 6 decrease of &# 948; 13 CO 2 with additional clear trends during the different sub-periods.
