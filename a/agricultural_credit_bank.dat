Firstly, the paper examines the legislation governing cooperatives with a credit section, comparing the Valencian legislation {{with that of the}} rest of Spain (in particular, the legislation in Catalonia and Extremadura). Secondly, looking at the matter from an economic perspective, we examine the advantages of <b>credit</b> sections for <b>agricultural</b> cooperatives (transaction costs) and analyse the credit sections’ levels of performance and efficiency, comparing them with those of <b>agricultural</b> <b>credit</b> <b>banks</b> and savings banks. Finally, from a social perspective, we analyse the benefits that credit sections can offer members and other sections of the agricultural cooperative to which they belong.

50|$|While {{the efforts}} made {{to develop the}} {{agricultural}} and mineral resources of the country proved successful, the towns continued to suffer from the inflation - over-buying, over-building and over-speculation - which marked the war period. As a consequence, imports further declined during 1906 - 1907, and receipts being largely dependent on customs {{the result was a}} considerably diminished revenue. The accounts for the year ending 30 June 1907 showed a deficit of £640,455. The decline in revenue, £4,000,000 in four years, while not a true reflection of the economic condition of the country - yearly becoming more self-supporting by the increase in home produce - caused general disquiet and injuriously affected the position of the ministry. In the session of 1907 the opposition in the legislative council brought on a crisis by refusing to grant supplies voted by the lower chamber. Dr Jameson contested the constitutional right of the council so to act, and on his advice the governor dissolved parliament in September 1907. Before its dissolution parliament passed an act imposing a profit tax of 10% on diamond- and copper-mining companies earning over £50,000 per annum, and another act establishing an <b>agricultural</b> <b>credit</b> <b>bank.</b>|$|E
5000|$|One of Hagen's most {{controversial}} publications appeared in 1814 {{and dealt with}} the impact of the Agriculture Law. Hagen demanded, as urgent and necessary, national reform and the lifting of burdensome obligations owed by peasant farmers to the land owners. In the face of opposition to such reforms from the nobility and the major land owners, Hagen was able to invoke the ideas of Albrecht Thaer (1752 - 1828), the founder of rational land-use theory, in his advocacy of [...] "reason-based ownership structures with equalised land holdings" [...] ("rationelle Betriebsformen mit Flächenausdehnung der landwirtschaftlichen Betriebe"). [...] As early as 1814 Hagen was promoting the idea that the burden of indebtedness between peasant farmers and land owners could be ameliorated through the application of special reduced interest rates on outstanding debt burdens, to be applied using credit institutions established to mediate the debtor-creditor relationships, and through reforming land ownership laws. His ideas anticipated measures that came to be implemented more than a generation, notably with the creation of the early <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Credit</b> <b>Bank</b> ("Landwirtschaftliche Rentenbank") founded in 1849. [...] Throughout his 45 years of public service Hagen was known as an advocate of economic liberalism, opposing tariff barriers. He was an early campaigner for free trade across Europe.|$|E

The project was implemented by an internationally experienced consultant in the field of crop insurance, who reviewed the crop insurance programme, its recently introduced schemes and methods of loss assessment, and identified training and other needsThe loss assessment capacity of the programme must be improved significantly, and the staff should be increased in number and trained. The separation of the insurance function from the credit function of the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Credit</b> <b>Bank</b> should be postponed for at least five years.

Underwriting material for cattle and poultry insurance should be requestedLoss assessors should meet regularly and hold joint practical assessments, and should also meet regularly with crop and livestock specialists. More assessors should be trained, and should be identified among agricultural extension workers and retired agriculturists.

40|$|Lack {{of access}} to credit has been {{identified}} as one of the main factors militating against the development of smallholder agriculture. Even though some financial institutions are not considering agricultural finance because of the risks and uncertainties associated with crop production, there are still some institutions who have found innovative ways of extending credit to smallholder farmers in the Northern Region of Ghana. This study therefore sought to document the different types of institutional credit available to farmers and farmer groups in the region. Primary data was collected through key informant interviews using a checklist. Qualitative analysis was employed to generate results for discussion. Institutions that were found to provide <b>agricultural</b> <b>credit</b> included <b>banks,</b> farmer associations, microfinance and non-governmental organizations.
