5000|$|Statistics New Zealand defines <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> in New Zealand, {{which are}} {{independent}} of any administrative subdivisions and have no legal basis. There are three classes of urban area: main <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> are the 17 <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> which have <b>a</b> population of 30,000 or more; secondary <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> are the 14 <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> which have <b>a</b> population of 10,000 or more but less than 30,000, and minor <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> are the 103 <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> which have <b>a</b> population of 1,000 or more but less than 10,000. <b>Urban</b> <b>areas</b> are reclassified after each Census, so population changes between censuses does not change <b>an</b> <b>urban</b> <b>area's</b> classification. For example, Rolleston (pop. [...] ) is still classified as <b>a</b> minor <b>urban</b> <b>area</b> because its population was under 10,000 at the 2013 Census.|$|R

5|$|At a {{distance}} of , Epsilon Eridani is the 13th-nearest known star (and ninth nearest solitary star or stellar system) to the Sun as of 2014. Its proximity makes {{it one of the}} most studied stars of its spectral type. Epsilon Eridani is located in the northern part of the constellation Eridanus, about 3° east of the slightly brighter star Delta Eridani. With a declination of −9.46°, Epsilon Eridani can be viewed from much of Earth's surface, at suitable times of year. Only to the north of latitude 80°N is it permanently hidden below the horizon. The apparent magnitude of 3.73 can make it difficult to observe from <b>an</b> <b>urban</b> <b>area</b> with the unaided eye, because the night skies over cities are obscured by light pollution.|$|E

5|$|Urbanization {{can result}} in the {{fragmentation}} of contiguous natural landscapes into patchy habitat within <b>an</b> <b>urban</b> <b>area.</b> Animals that live in these fragmented areas often have reduced movement between the habitat patches, {{which can lead to}} reduced gene flow and pathogen transmission between patches. Animals such as the bobcat are particularly sensitive to fragmentation because of their large home ranges. A study in coastal Southern California has shown bobcat populations are affected by urbanization, creation of roads, and other developments. The populations may not be declining as much as predicted, but instead the connectivity of different populations is affected. This leads to a decrease in natural genetic diversity among bobcat populations. For bobcats, preserving open space in sufficient quantities and quality is necessary for population viability. Educating local residents about the animals is critical, as well, for conservation in urban areas.|$|E
5|$|The Chalk River, Ontario, {{site was}} {{established}} to rehouse the Allied effort at the Montreal Laboratory away from <b>an</b> <b>urban</b> <b>area.</b> A new community was built at Deep River, Ontario, to provide residences and facilities for the team members. The site was chosen for its proximity to the industrial manufacturing area of Ontario and Quebec, and proximity to a rail head adjacent to a large military base, Camp Petawawa. Located on the Ottawa River, it had access to abundant water. The first {{director of the new}} laboratory was Hans von Halban. He was replaced by John Cockcroft in May 1944, who in turn was succeeded by Bennett Lewis in September 1946. A pilot reactor known as ZEEP (zero-energy experimental pile) became the first Canadian reactor, and the first to be completed outside the United States, when it went critical in September 1945, ZEEP remained in use by researchers until 1970. A larger 10MW NRX reactor, which was designed during the war, was completed and went critical in July 1947.|$|E
