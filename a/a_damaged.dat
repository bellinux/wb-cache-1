However, Tosk attempts to steal from a weapons locker and is put in a holding cell by Security Chief Odo (René Auberjonois).|$|E
5|$|About a {{month after}} Typhoon Kaemi {{affected}} the region, Saomai caused additional flooding in the inland province of Jiangxi. There, the storm wrecked six reservoirs, resulting in ¥348million (RMB, $45million USD) in damage. About 35,000people were forced to evacuate in Jiangxi due to the storm. One person was washed away in floodwaters while inspecting damage, while another person was killed when <b>a</b> <b>damaged</b> building collapsed. In neighboring Anhui province, flooding forced residents to evacuate homes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the dive bombers were attacking, the 20 torpedo bombers were also {{approaching}} Hornet from two different directions. Despite suffering heavy losses from anti-aircraft fire, the torpedo planes planted two torpedoes into Hornets side between 09:13 and 09:17, knocking out her engines. As Hornet came to a stop, <b>a</b> <b>damaged</b> Japanese dive bomber approached and purposely crashed into the carrier's side, starting a fire near the ship's main supply of aviation fuel. At 09:20, the surviving Japanese aircraft departed, leaving Hornet dead in the water and burning. Twenty-five Japanese and six American aircraft were destroyed in this attack.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea centre back Frank Sinclair {{and left}} back Graeme Le Saux were both sidelined {{for the final}} due to their calf injuries, causing player-manager Vialli to swap them with Michael Duberry, and Danny Granville, who had {{recovered}} from an abscess pain.

5|$|For the {{remaining}} {{week of the}} fighting in South Norway, Kommandøren was docked at Kvamsøya, immobilized by <b>a</b> <b>damaged</b> axle. As part of the ceasefire agreement accepted by the Norwegians in Western Norway in the evening of 1 May 1940, Kommandøren was {{to be handed over}} to the Germans, along with the ferry Lærdal and 40 smaller boats. The transfer of the ships occurred at Lærdal on 2 May, and the ceasefire was announced on 3 May. The Germans used Kommandøren and the other vessels for a limited period to transport troops to occupy various places in Western Norway.|$|E
5|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{requires the}} presence of an identical or nearly identical sequence {{to be used as a}} template for repair of the break. The enzymatic machinery responsible for this repair process is nearly identical to the machinery responsible for chromosomal crossover during meiosis. This pathway allows <b>a</b> <b>damaged</b> chromosome to be repaired using a sister chromatid (available in G2 after DNA replication) or a homologous chromosome as a template. DSBs caused by the replication machinery attempting to synthesize across a single-strand break or unrepaired lesion cause collapse of the replication fork and are typically repaired by recombination.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} <b>a</b> {{multiscale}} <b>damage</b> criterion for fatigue life prediction is introduced. <b>A</b> <b>damage</b> evolution rule based on strain energy density {{is modified to}} incorporate crystal plasticity at the microscale. <b>A</b> <b>damage</b> tensor that indicates the local damage state is derived using optimization theory. Local damage information is passed from local to grain level {{in the form of}} <b>a</b> <b>damage</b> vector via averaging techniques. Finally, the damage evolution rule for a meso representative volume element (RVE) is calculated through the Kreisselmeier-Steinhauser (KS) function, which can produce an envelope function for multiobjective optimization. The weighted averaging method is also used to obtain the corresponding damage evolution direction for the meso RVE. <b>A</b> critical <b>damage</b> value is derived in this paper to complete the damage criterion for fatigue life prediction.

5|$|House {{was created}} by David Shore, who {{got the idea for}} the misanthropic title {{character}} from a doctor's visit. Initially, producer Bryan Singer wanted an American to play House, but British actor Hugh Laurie's audition convinced him that a foreign actor could play the role. Shore wrote House as a character with parallels to Sherlock Holmes—both are drug users, blunt, and close to being friendless. The show's producers wanted House handicapped in some way and gave the character <b>a</b> <b>damaged</b> leg arising from an improper diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|In Budapest Tales (1976), Szabó traded his earlier, complex {{narrative}} structures, {{characterized by}} flashbacks and dreams, {{for a more}} linear one. At the same time, he traded the literal representation of history for an allegorical one. The film follows a disparate {{group of people who}} come together on the outskirts of an unnamed city {{at the end of an}} unnamed war to repair <b>a</b> <b>damaged</b> tram and ride it into the city. Allegorically, the film was interpreted by critics variously as representing Hungarian history specifically or universal human responses to war and reconstruction more generally.|$|E
