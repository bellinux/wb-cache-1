25|$|A two-speed, {{two-stage}} supercharger and intercooler {{were used}} to compress then cool the <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixture,</b> following Griffon and Merlin practice. Starting was by Coffman starter. An auxiliary shaft driven by the lower crankshaft operated the main coolant pump, intercooler coolant pump, pressure and scavenge oil pumps and a fuel injection pump. Piston ring failures and cylinder head sealing problems were experienced during early flight testing.|$|E
50|$|Nitromethane {{is usually}} used with rich <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixtures</b> because it {{provides}} power {{even in the absence}} of atmospheric oxygen. When rich <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixtures</b> are used, hydrogen and carbon monoxide are two of the combustion products. These gases often ignite, sometimes spectacularly, as the normally very rich mixtures of the still burning fuel exits the exhaust ports. Very rich mixtures are necessary to reduce the temperature of combustion chamber hot parts in order to control pre-ignition and subsequent detonation. Operational details depend on the particular mixture and engine characteristics.|$|R

50|$|More of {{a working}} {{research}} vehicle than a technology demonstrator, the 1981 VW Jetta prototype was part of Ricardo’s HRCC programme to improve the fuel economy of gasoline engines {{through a number of}} measures, including a much higher compression ratio, the ability to run on very lean <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixtures,</b> and the tolerance of lower- octane fuels.|$|R
25|$|Due to a 50% longer stroke {{duration}} than a reciprocating four-cycle engine, {{there is}} more time to complete the combustion. This leads to greater suitability for direct fuel injection and stratified charge operation. A Wankel rotary engine has stronger flows of <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixture</b> and a longer operating cycle than a reciprocating engine, achieving a concomitantly thorough mixing of hydrogen and air. The result is a homogeneous mixture and no hot spots in the engine, which is crucial for hydrogen combustion.|$|E
25|$|Homogeneous charge {{compression}} ignition (HCCI) {{involves the use}} of a pre-mixed lean <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixture</b> being compressed to the point of auto-ignition, so electronic spark ignition is eliminated. Gasoline engines combine homogeneous charge (HC) with spark ignition (SI), abbreviated as HCSI. Diesel engines combine stratified charge (SC) with {{compression ignition}} (CI), abbreviated as SCCI. HCCI engines achieve gasoline engine-like emissions with compression ignition engine-like efficiency, and low levels of nitrogen oxide emissions (NO x) without a catalytic converter. However, unburned hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions still require treatment to conform with automotive emission regulations.|$|E
25|$|The {{ignition}} coil's {{high voltage}} output {{is connected to the}} rotor that sits on top of the distributor shaft. Surrounding the rotor is the distributor cap. The arrangement sequentially directs the output of the secondary winding to the appropriate spark plugs. The high voltage from the coil's secondary (typically 20,000 to 50,000 volts) causes a spark to form across the gap of the spark plug that in turn ignites the compressed <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixture</b> within the engine. It is the creation of this spark which consumes the energy that was stored in the ignition coil’s magnetic field.|$|E

A 250, 000 Btu/h furnace fired with technical grade methane {{was used for}} testing the sampling probes {{over a wide range}} of <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixtures.</b> The results obtained include the finding that the use of stainless steel in probes creates inaccuracies in near-stoichiometric and fuel-rich sampling in hydrocarbon flames. For very fuel-rich flames, water cooling is needed even in quartz probes to prevent significant reduction of nitric oxide. ...|$|R
50|$|The BlueTEC {{system was}} created because the {{properties}} of the Diesel cycle that give diesel engines higher fuel efficiency also lead to relatively higher emissions of certain pollutants compared to Otto cycle engines. High compression ratios and lean <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixtures</b> make high combustion temperatures, which results in more nitrogen oxides being produced during the combustion. While the particulate matter can be controlled with higher injection pressures and particulate filters, the big challenge is limiting NOx; Tier 2 regulations in the US are 0.07 grams per mile of NOx, which is ⅛ of the 0.40 limit in the European Union.|$|R
25|$|The most {{fundamental}} change {{made to the}} later Merlin (60, 70, 80 and 100 series) and Griffon engines (60 and 80 series) was the incorporation of a two-stage, two-speed supercharger, which provided a considerable increase in power, especially at higher altitudes. Two-stage refers {{to the use of}} two impellers on a common driveshaft, constituting two superchargers in series. As air was drawn through the air intake, fuel was pumped into the airstream by the carburettor. The first-stage impeller compressed the <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixture</b> and this was then fed to the smaller second-stage impeller which further compressed the mixture.|$|E
25|$|The full remedy {{was to use}} the Bendix-Stromberg {{pressure}} carburettor, {{which allowed}} more precise metering {{of the amount of}} fuel used by the engine and prevented fuel starvation. This new carburettor was used from the Merlin 66 series and on all Griffon engines. In these engines the carburettor injected fuel at 5 psi through a nozzle direct into the supercharger and the compressed <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixture</b> was then directed to the cylinders. The final development was the SU injection carburettor, that injected fuel into the supercharger using a fuel pump driven as a function of crankshaft speed and engine pressures; although this was fitted to the 100 series Merlins, which were not used in production Spitfires, it was used in the Griffon 60 and 80 series.|$|E
25|$|An intercooler, was {{required}} to stop the compressed mixture from becoming too hot and either igniting before reaching the cylinders (pre-ignition knocking) or creating a condition known as knocking or detonation. The intercooler, which was separate from the engine cooling system, with its own supply of glycol and water coolant, was mounted in the induction system, between the outlet of the second-stage supercharger and behind the cylinder blocks. The hot <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixture</b> from the supercharger was circulated though and around the coolant tubes and was then {{passed on to the}} main induction manifold, through which it was fed into the cylinders. The intercooler also circulated coolant through passages in the supercharger casing and between the impellers. Finally, an extra radiator (mounted in the starboard radiator duct under the wing of the Spitfire) was used to dissipate the intercooler's excess charge heat.|$|E
40|$|Modern {{ignition}} {{systems for}} spark ignition (SI) engine management systems require an extended (adaptive) spark with regulated spark discharge duration for reliable ignition of fuel mixture and elimination of misfired-cycles. Lean <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixtures</b> and alternative fuels also require an improved ignition system. In {{order to meet}} the increased requirements for ignition systems there is a multispark capacitor discharge ignition (CDI) system developed with prolonged spark duration. Block diagram of CDI system is presented; the principle of the operation of the system elements is explained. Mathematical model of the processes of the CDI system are developed.

5000|$|Heavy-duty lean-burn {{gas engines}} admit {{twice as much}} [...] air than {{theoretically}} needed for complete combustion into the combustion chambers. The extremely weak <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixtures</b> lead to lower combustion temperatures and therefore lower NOx formation. While lean-burn gas engines offer higher theoretical thermal efficiencies, transient response and performance may be compromised in certain situations. However, advances in fuel control and closed loop technology by companies like North American Repower have led to production of modern CARB certified lean burn heavy duty engines for use in commercial vehicle fleets. Lean-burn gas engines are almost always turbocharged, resulting in high power and torque figures not achievable with stoichiometric engines due to high combustion temperatures.|$|R

They reduce the induction period and decrease the ignition temperature. The atomic oxygen produced in the discharge initiates the ignition process. It makes the RF DBD {{a good candidate for}} the ignition of <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixtures</b> under high pressures.

2500|$|If, via a {{turbocharger}} as an example, the 1800cc engine {{were using}} an <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixture</b> that was significantly more energy dense, then {{it might be}} able to produce more power than a 2000cc engine burning a less energy dense <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixture.</b> [...] Unfortunately turbochargers are both complex and expensive. [...] Thus it becomes clear for high-horsepower/high-torque engines a fuel that can inherently be used to create a more energy dense <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixture</b> is preferred because a smaller and simpler engine can be used to produce the same power.|$|E
2500|$|In {{internal}} combustion engines {{the volume of}} the cylinders is a common measure of the power of an engine. [...] Thus a 2000cc engine would typically be more powerful than a 1800cc engine, but that assumes a similar <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixture</b> is used.|$|E

50|$|MSD Ignition was {{the first}} {{company in the world}} to {{experiment}} with Multiple Spark Discharge for the ignition system of internal combustion engines in 1970. The idea was first proposed by a group of engineers working on the White Sands Missile Range in southern New Mexico. The engineers worked for the research and development company Autotronic Controls Corporation (ACC) that was striving to develop leaner burning fuel systems to increase engine fuel efficiency. The engineers discovered that their limiting factor to efficiently burning the extremely lean <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixtures</b> was {{that they did not have}} ample spark to ignite the mixtures.

40|$|The {{influence}} of several factors on the abrasion resistance of thermally sprayed, chromium carbide based hardmetal coatings is evaluated in this contribution. First of all, {{the structure of}} the feedstock powders was varied, which is determined by the powder synthesis route agglomeration-and-sintering plus optional post-densification. For the coating deposition high velocity spraying with both oxygen-fuel and <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixtures</b> was applied. Furthermore, the hardmetal composition was modified by addition of tungsten carbides (10 and 37 wt. %). The abrasion tests at low temperatures in both low- and high-stress regimes demonstrated an increase in the coatings wear resistance by use of densified feedstock powders and fuel-air spraying. At high temperatures up to 800 °C these differences diminish, since the coatings microstructures equilibrate by the action of the heat input. The addition of tungsten carbides increases the wear resistance under all tested conditions, most notably also at high temperatures of 800 °C...|$|R
40|$|Low {{temperature}} diesel combustion {{has been}} widely investigated {{over the last few}} years for reducing in-cylinder emissions of Direct Injection (DI) diesel engines without sacrificing efficiency and fuel consumption.

As the critical altitude was passed a pressure-operated aneroid capsule operated the gearbox, which changed speed to Full Supercharger (F.S.) gear, which drove the impellers faster, thus compressing a greater volume of the <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixture.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of a plasma initiated by an optical pulsed-mode discharge on the propagation velocity and stability intervals of turbulent flames in homogeneous <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixtures</b> (hydrogen and hydrocarbons) is experimentally studied for various intensities of the initiating laser beam. Traditional means (formation of flow-separation regions) were used to stabilize the combustion. Burning characteristics were compared with those obtained during initiation of the process with the optical discharge, all other experimental conditions being identical. It is found that, during the burning initiated by the laser beam, the burning rate increases and flame stability intervals (with respect to the velocity and chemical composition of the mixture) become wider. The effect is predominantly caused by gas-dynamic factors (turbulization of flow) and by high energy added to the flow. It is established {{that there are two}} mechanisms underlying the ignition and combustion processes. For hydrogen-air and methane-air mixtures, a thermal mechanism is operating. For complex hydrocarbon fuels, a transition from one mechanism to another is possible under the action of the laser-beam energy. In the latter case, pre-flame chemical reaction proceed, and the burning may develop without any optical break-down. Data on the effect of flow parameters, chemical properties of the combustible mixtures, and the repetition frequency of laser-irradiation pulses on the flame velocity are reported...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} an experimental investigation into the operation of a compression ignition (CI) engine in homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) mode using hydrogen fuel. Factors that were investigated include engine efficiency, emissions and mechanical loads. Hydrogen {{was found to be}} a possible fuel for operation of a CI engine in HCCI mode. The heat release rate is extremely high, which leads to high ignition timing control requirements. The ignition timing was controlled using heating of the inlet air, and satisfactory performance was demonstrated using this method. Some cycle-to-cycle variations were, however, observed due to the difficulty in achieving accurate control of ignition timing. Use of hydrogen in HCCI engines allows operation with very lean <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixtures,</b> giving extremely low emissions of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants. Operation with an excess air ratio of 6 was demonstrated, and a maximum fuel efficiency of 45 % was achieved with an excess air ratio of 3. The maximum power of the engine in HCCI mode is, however, quite modest, being limited by the need for inlet air heating to ensure auto ignition, which reduces the air mass flow through the engine. There are also mechanical limitations to the operation of the HCCI hydrogen engine at high loads due to higher rates of pressure rise and in-cylinder peak pressures compared to conventional diesel mode. ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the case}} of the V-1650, used from the P-51B on, two sets of power ratings can be quoted because these engines were fitted with two-stage, {{two-speed}} superchargers; the maximum power generated by the V-1650-3 was [...] at the critical altitude of [...] in low blower using [...] of mercury (61" [...] Hg) [...] "boost". The [...] "boost" [...] is the pressure to which the <b>air–fuel</b> <b>mixture</b> is compressed before being fed through to the engine's cylinders (manifold pressure). Because air pressure and air density decrease with altitude, the efficiency of a piston engine drops because of the reduction in the amount of air that can be drawn into the engine; for example, the air density at [...] is ⅓ of that at sea level, thus only ⅓ of the amount of air can be drawn into the cylinder and only ⅓ of the fuel can be burnt.|$|E
2500|$|With a {{compressed}} {{natural gas}} (CNG) engine, the mixing of the fuel and the air is more effective since gases typically mix well {{in a short period}} of time, but at typical CNG compression pressures the fuel itself is less energy dense than gas or diesel thus the end result is a lower energy dense <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixture.</b> Thus for the same cylinder displacement engine, a non turbocharged CNG powered engine is typically less powerful than a similarly sized gas or diesel engine. [...] For that reason turbochargers are popular on European CNG cars. Despite that limitation, the 12 liter Cummins Westport ISX12G engine is an example of a CNG capable engine designed to pull tractor/trailer loads up to 80,000 lbs showing CNG can be used in most if not all on-road truck applications.

[...] A properly designed high-horsepower engine can leverage this extremely high pressure energy dense gaseous fuel source to create a higher energy density <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixture</b> than can be efficiently created with a CNG powered engine.

Chapter Three comprehensively reviews literature on fuel characteristics; specifically boiling point, chemistry {{and the difference between}} the Research and Motor Octane Number (RON and MON). Furthermore different types of autoignition are discussed with regards to their detection and assessment in the chapter. The subsection on engine management looks at possible methods of altering and eliminating autoignition. Chapter Four details the equipment used to obtain data and measurements, as well as the signal conditioning of the spark and injector signal. Chapter Five {{discusses the}} actual results obtained during summer testing of the different methods of altering and eliminating autoignition in an internal combustion engine, as derived from the theories presented in Chapter Three. The summer tests finally verified the new application level and showed that only a reduction in the quantity of fuel injected can eliminate autoignition. However, a slight decrease in heat release does cause an increase in start time.

40|$|The NOx {{emissions}} {{during the}} crank-start and cold fast-idle phases of a GDI engine are analyzed in detail. The NOx emissions {{of the first}} 3 firing cycles are studied under a wide set of parameters including the mass of fuel injected, start of injection, and ignition timing. The results show a strong dependence of the NOx emissions with injection timing; they are significantly reduced as the mixture is stratified. The impact of different valve timings on crank-start NOx emissions was analyzed. Late intake and early exhaust timings show similar potential for NOx reduction; 26 - 30 % lower than the baseline. The combined strategy, resulting in a large symmetric negative valve overlap, shows the greatest reduction; 59 % lower than the baseline. The cold fast-idle NOx emissions were studied under different equivalence ratios, injection strategies, combustion phasing, and valve timings. Slightly lean <b>air-fuel</b> <b>mixtures</b> result in a significant reduction of NOx. The engine-out emissions are highly sensitivity to combustion phasing.
