40|$|SummaryThe {{treatment}} of complicated intra-abdominal infections continues to challenge physicians, {{primarily because of}} the polymicrobial nature of these infections coupled with the high risk of complications and even death among the more severe patients. The initial selection of antimicrobial therapy for {{treatment of}} nosocomial intraabdominal infections is extremely important because an association has been shown between inappropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy and delayed clinical resolution, increased length of hospital stay, and an increased risk of mortality. Moreover, it is becoming more frequent for isolates recovered from patients to possess multiple resistance factors (e. g., extended-spectrum β-lactamases [ESBLs], vancomycin-resistant enterococci [VRE]). Therefore, when selecting empiric antimicrobial therapy, the physician must consider the likelihood of encountering one of these difficult-to-treat isolates and select an agent or agents with <b>anticipated</b> <b>activity</b> against such organisms. Here, we discuss the merits and limitations of empiric therapy for nosocomial intra-abdominal infections, review the current guidelines for treatment, and discuss the therapeutic options currently available...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} novel isoxazole {{derivatives}} were efficiently synthesized through the adaptation/modification of an in situ synthetic procedure for pyrazoles. All novel compounds were tested against four different cell lines {{to evaluate their}} antiproliferative activity. Based on the Hela cells {{results of this study}} and previous work, a classification model to predict the anti-proliferative activity of isoxazole and pyrazole derivatives was developed. Random Forest modeling was used in view of the development of an accurate and reliable model that was subsequently validated. A virtual screening study was then proposed for the design of novel active derivatives. Compounds 9 and 11 demonstrated significant cytostatic activity; the fused isoxazole derivative 18 and the virtually proposed compound 2 v, were proved at least 10 times more potent as compared to compound 9, with IC 50 values near and below 1  μM. In conclusion, a new series of isoxazoles was exploited with some of them exhibiting promising cytostatic activities. Further studies on the substitution pattern of the isoxazole core can potentially provide compounds with cytostatic action at the nM scale.

40|$|Background: Medical {{errors are}} {{a serious threat}} to {{chemotherapy}} patients. Patients can make contributions to safety but {{little is known about the}} acceptability of error-preventing behaviors and its predictors. Patients and methods: A cross-sectional survey study among chemotherapy patients treated at the oncology/hematology unit of a regional hospital was conducted. Patients were presented vignettes of errors and unsafe acts and responded to measures of attitudes, behavioral control, norms, barriers, and anticipated reaction. Results: A total of 479 patients completed the survey (52 % response rate). Patients reported a high level of <b>anticipated</b> <b>activity</b> but intentions to engage for safety varied considerably between the hypothetical scenarios (range: 57 %- 96 %, χ 2 P < 0. 001). Health, knowledge and staff time pressure were perceived as most important barriers. Instrumental [odds ratio (OR) = 1. 3, P = 0. 046] and experiential attitudes (OR = 1. 4, P < 0. 001), expectations attributed to clinical staff (OR = 1. 2, P = 0. 024) and behavioral control (OR = 1. 8, P < 0. 001) were predictors for patients' behaviors. Conclusions: Patients are affirmative toward engaging for safety but perceive considerable barriers. Intentions to engage in error prevention vary by clinical context and are strongly influenced by attitudes, normative and control beliefs. To successfully involve patients in medical error, prevention clinicians need to address their patients' beliefs and reduce barriers through educatio...|$|E
40|$|Pigment grade {{titanium}} dioxide {{is composed of}} sub-micron sized particles, including a nano fraction, and is widely utilised in food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical and biomedical industries. Oral exposure to pigment grade {{titanium dioxide}} results {{in at least some}} material entering the circulation in humans, although subsequent interactions with blood immune cells are unknown. Pigment grade titanium dioxide is employed for its strong light scattering properties and this work exploited that attribute to determine whether single cell-particle associations could be determined in immune cells of human whole blood at ‘real life’ concentrations. In vitro assays, initially using isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, identified titanium dioxide associated with the surface of, and within, individual immune cells by darkfield reflectance in imaging flow cytometry. This was confirmed at the population level by side scatter measurements using conventional flow cytometry. Next it was demonstrated that imaging flow cytometry could quantify titanium dioxide particle-bearing cells, within the immune cell populations of fresh whole blood, down to titanium dioxide levels of 10 parts per billion, which is in the range anticipated for human blood following titanium dioxide ingestion. Moreover, surface association and internal localisation of titanium dioxide particles could be discriminated in the assays. Overall, results showed that in addition to the <b>anticipated</b> <b>activity</b> of blood monocytes internalising titanium dioxide particles, neutrophil internalisation and cell membrane adhesion also occurred, the latter for both phagocytic and non-phagocytic cell types.

40|$|This thesis {{proceeds}} from the question: How can community participation facilitate a physically and socially sustainable development of Roald? It describes a process departing from the hypothesis that participation may strengthen the bonds between population and government and that ownership of place increases with increased influence upon the physical development of a landscape. The project area is Roald at Vigra island in Giske municipality, North-Western Norway, and the process has to goals: 1) To identify and perform an approach that is suited to the context of Roald, and 2) Arrive at a comprehensive plan for future development that empowers the community. The thesis is divided into five main sections. The {{first part of the}} thesis provides an introduction to the case area and relevant literature and craft an approach adapted to the case study. The following three parts address the conducting of the case study and its main findings. The final part is a discussion that addresses the research question and goals. The literature applied focuses on theories such as sustainability, the ladder of citizen participation and social capital. Based on The 12 Steps to Community Participation by Randy T. Hester Jr., the case study of Roald is divided into three main phases - explore, investigate, and develop. Each phase is introduced with a review of the participation methods applied. In Phase 1, Roald: Explored the image of Roald is formed: presently a suburb to Ålesund and a former prosperous fishing and agriculture community. The image has derived from the online survey, personal interviews, workshops, social events and the landscape analysis, and identify the three main challenges of Roald: 1) a rapid and uncontrolled residential development that threatens the natural qualities of the area, 2) a dead village center, and 3) decentralized social networks that lead to alienation and disclaiming of responsibility. The challenges underline the need for a comprehensive plan for development that can involve and empower residents during the development and implementation. In Phase 2, Roald: Investigated, a workshop focusing on setting goals for Roald and drawing <b>anticipated</b> <b>activity</b> settings is conducted, and this results in a spectrum of plans. Phase 3, Roald: Designed, addresses the presentation of the spectrum of plans and the design of the final plan adapted to the community feedback. This phase also includes an implementation plan, demonstrated through “The Bridging Model,” which seeks to engage more members of the community. Roald community is not familiar with community participation, but The 12 Steps to Community Participation has proven to be an approach highly suitable for the community because it is flexible and makes it possible to adapt to a particular context. The conclusion confirms the hypothesis but simultaneously highlights that it, because of its simplicity, provides an inadequate representation of the outcome. Through The 12 Steps to Community Participation the bonds between power holders, the community and the landscape are strengthened, but in addition, the distances decrease. The Bridging Model is designed to ensure that the bonds remain strong, facilitating a more socially sustainable development. When individual citizens are provided with more responsibility through The Bridging Model, their connection to the landscape, and their urge to care for it, will grow stronger, thus resulting in a more physical sustainable development...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} detecting past activities as well as <b>anticipating</b> which <b>activity</b> {{will happen in the}} future and how.

In this paper, we reason about these alternate possibilities by reasoning over multiple possible graph structures. We obtain them by approximating the graph with only additive features, which lends to efficient dynamic programming.
