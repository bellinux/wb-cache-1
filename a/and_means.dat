Upon exposure to snowmachines, caribou were displaced 60 to 237 m from their initial locations. Groups with calves allowed the snowmachines to approach more closely before responding (5 to 600 m) than adult-only groups (30 to 1300 m), and their overall flight distances were less. Time spent in locomotion and overall reaction time were greater for animals engaged in the most sedentary activities (eg. standing; mean = 239 s <b>and</b> <b>mean</b> = 262 s, <b>and</b> lying; <b>mean</b> = 166 s <b>and</b> <b>mean</b> = 273 s) than for animals already engaged in more dynamic activities such as walking (mean = 118 s <b>and</b> <b>mean</b> = 133 s), running (mean = 74 s <b>and</b> <b>mean</b> = 63 s) <b>and</b> feeding (<b>mean</b> = 118 s <b>and</b> <b>mean</b> = 133 s).

40|$|Objective: This study {{assessed}} the quantitative {{evaluation of the}} region of interest (ROI) by <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> maximum pixel counts of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans in patients with clinical suspicion of unilateral condylar hyperactivity (UCH); the interobserver reliability and the correlation of condylar activity with patient age was determined. Methods: Two independent observers analyzed 67 bone SPECT scans. Maximum <b>and</b> <b>mean</b> activity values within an ROI on the mandibular condyle were analyzed; a cutoff value of 55 % {{was used to determine}} the qualitative outcome. Results: Excellent interobserver agreement was seen for both maximum (kappa 1. 0) <b>and</b> <b>mean</b> activity analysis (kappa 0. 94). Maximum <b>and</b> <b>mean</b> condylar activities were strongly correlated (r > 0. 98). Maximum <b>and</b> <b>mean</b> condylar activity of the normal condyle decreased significantly with increasing age. Conclusions: Maximum <b>and</b> <b>mean</b> condylar activity levels were highly correlated in patients with mandibular asymmetry.

5|$|Tariffs {{had been}} raised to high levels during the Civil War. Afterwards, Garfield, who made a close study of {{financial}} affairs, advocated moving towards free trade, though the standard Republican position was a protective tariff that would allow American industries to grow. This break with his party likely cost him his place on the Ways <b>and</b> <b>Means</b> Committee in 1867, and though Republicans held {{the majority in the}} House until 1875, Garfield remained off that committee during that time. Garfield came to chair the powerful House Appropriations Committee, but it was Ways <b>and</b> <b>Means,</b> with its influence over fiscal policy, that he really wanted to lead. Part of the reason Garfield was denied a place on Ways <b>and</b> <b>Means</b> was the opposition of the influential Republican editor, Horace Greeley.|$|E

40|$|While the {{negative}} effects of inbreeding and reduced heterozygosity on fecundity and survival are well established, only a few investigations have been carried out concerning their influence on morphological traits. This topic is of particular interest for a small and closed population such as the Lipizzan horse. Thus, 27 morphological traits were measured in 360 Lipizzan mares and were regressed on the individual inbreeding coefficients, {{as well as on the}} individual heterozygosity <b>and</b> <b>mean</b> squared distances (mean d 2) between microsatellite alleles within an individual. Both individual heterozygosity <b>and</b> <b>mean</b> d 2 were based on 17 microsatellite loci dispersed over 14 chromosomes. The results obtained by multivariate analysis reveal significant effects of stud (P <. 0001), age at measurement (P <. 0001), <b>and</b> <b>mean</b> d 2 (P =. 0143). In univariate analyses, significant associations were obtained between length of pastern-hindlimbs and inbreeding coefficient (P <. 01), length of cannons-hindlimb <b>and</b> <b>mean</b> d 2 (P <. 01), and length of neck <b>and</b> <b>mean</b> d 2 (P <. 001). After adjustment of single-test P values for multiple tests (Hochberg's step-up Bonferroni method), only the association of the length of neck <b>and</b> <b>mean</b> d 2 remained significant (P =. 0213).

5|$|By {{the time}} of Stanley's {{election}} to the House, the American Tobacco Company had eliminated all its substantial competitors either by acquisition or by driving them out of business. The company worked with British tobacco manufacturers to set tobacco prices worldwide. Congressman Stanley came {{to the defense of}} the tobacco farmers of his district, making him virtually unbeatable as a congressional candidate. In the first of his five consecutive terms, he authored a bill that would remove an oppressive national tobacco tax, hoping this would help raise prices for unprocessed tobacco. The bill was defeated by extensive lobbying efforts by the American Tobacco Company. In 1904, he convinced the Ways <b>and</b> <b>Means</b> Committee to hold public hearings on the American Tobacco Company's monopolistic actions, but the hearings did not convince legislators to repeal the tax nor take action against the American Tobacco Company.|$|E
5|$|Carlisle {{selected}} William Ralls Morrison, another tariff reformer, to {{lead the}} Ways <b>and</b> <b>Means</b> committee, but allowed Randall {{to take charge of}} Appropriations. Morrison's committee produced a bill proposing tariff reductions of 20%; Randall opposed the idea from the start, as did the Republicans. Another bout of illness kept Randall away from Congress at a crucial time in April 1884, and the tariff bill passed a procedural hurdle by just two votes. Two days later, Randall's Appropriations committee reported several funding bills with his support. Many Democrats who had voted for Morrison's tariff were thereby reminded that Randall had the power to defeat spending that was important to them; when the final vote came, enough switched sides to join with Republicans in defeating the reform 156 to 151.|$|E

5|$|From {{his first}} term in Congress, McKinley was a strong {{advocate}} of protective tariffs. The primary purposes of such imposts was not to raise revenue, but to allow American manufacturing to develop by giving it a price advantage in the domestic market over foreign competitors. McKinley biographer Margaret Leech noted that Canton had become prosperous as a center for the manufacture of farm equipment because of protection, and that this may have helped form his political views. McKinley introduced and supported bills that raised protective tariffs, and opposed those that lowered them or imposed tariffs simply to raise revenue. Garfield's election as president in 1880 created a vacancy on the House Ways <b>and</b> <b>Means</b> Committee; McKinley was selected to fill it, placing him on the most powerful committee after only two terms.|$|E
