5|$|Barotrauma, {{an example}} of dysbarism, is {{physical}} damage to body tissues caused by <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in pressure between a gas space inside, or {{in contact with the}} body, and the surrounding gas or fluid.

5|$|Because of Copenhagen's {{northern}} latitude, {{the number}} of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 1 minute of daylight.
