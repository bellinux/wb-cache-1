5|$|In 1968, {{the second}} Congress of FRELIMO was a {{propaganda}} {{victory for the}} insurgents, despite <b>attempts</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese, who enjoyed air superiority throughout the conflict, to bomb {{the location of the}} meeting late in the day. This gave FRELIMO further weight to wield in the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|The secular popular {{tradition}} of music continued, despite <b>attempts</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Kirk, {{particularly in the}} Lowlands, to suppress dancing and events like penny weddings at which tunes were played. Large numbers of musicians continued to perform, including the fiddler Pattie Birnie and the piper Habbie Simpson (1550–1620).|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>attempts</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Mint {{to adjust}} the design, the coins proved to strike indistinctly, and {{to be subject to}} wear—the dates were easily worn away in circulation. In 1938, after the {{expiration}} of the minimum 25-year period during which the design could not be replaced without congressional authorization, it was replaced by the Jefferson nickel, designed by Felix Schlag. Fraser's design is admired today, and has been used on commemorative coins and the gold American Buffalo series.|$|E

5|$|During {{the final}} flight segment from Baltimore to Columbia, the crew {{experienced}} fuel flow disruptions to both right side engines, eventually leading {{both of them}} to shut down, after multiple unsuccessful <b>attempts</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> crew to restore proper fuel flow and engine operation. Flying with asymmetric thrust from the two left side engines (which were operating normally at that point), the captain decided to land at Byrd Field (now called Richmond International Airport), near Richmond, Virginia, as a precaution.|$|E
5|$|He {{had managed}} to retain some of his {{previous}} advisers, despite <b>attempts</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Ordainers to remove them, and divided the extensive de Clare inheritance among two of his new favourites, the former household knights Hugh Audley and Roger Damory, instantly making them extremely rich. Many of the moderates who had helped deliver the peaceful compromise in 1318 now began to turn against Edward, making violence ever more likely.|$|E
5|$|In April 1974, {{faced with}} <b>attempts</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Opposition to obstruct supply (appropriation bills) in the Senate, Whitlam {{obtained}} the concurrence of the Governor-General, Sir Paul Hasluck, to a double dissolution. Labor was returned at the election on 18 May with a reduced House majority of five seats. The Coalition and Labor each had 29 Senate seats, with {{the balance of}} power held by two independents.|$|E

5|$|In August 1878, Walker {{represented}} the United States {{at the third}} International Monetary Conference in Paris while also attending the 1878 Exposition. Not only were the <b>attempts</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> United States to re-establish an international silver standard defeated, but Walker also had to scramble to complete the report on the Exposition in only four days. Although {{he returned to the}} U.S. in October disheartened by the failure of the conference and exhausted by his obligations at the Exposition, the trip had secured Walker a commanding national and international reputation.|$|E
5|$|Justice John McKinley's {{death in}} 1852 led to repeated, fruitless <b>attempts</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{president}} {{to fill the}} vacancy. The Senate took no action on the nomination of New Orleans attorney Edward A. Bradford. Fillmore's second choice, George Edmund Badger, asked that his name be withdrawn. Senator-elect Judah P. Benjamin declined to serve. The nomination of William C. Micou, a New Orleans lawyer recommended by Benjamin, was not acted on by the Senate. The vacancy was finally filled after Fillmore's term, when President Franklin Pierce nominated John Archibald Campbell, who was confirmed by the Senate.|$|E

According to the Index of Multiple Deprivation of both 2010 and 2015, the eastern half of the village is the most deprived area of England.

5|$|Persistent <b>attempts</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Israeli {{government}} to identify another Palestinian leader {{to represent the}} Palestinian people failed. Arafat was enjoying the support of groups that, given his own history, would normally have been quite wary of dealing with or supporting him. Marwan Barghouti (a leader of al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades) emerged as a possible replacement during the Second Intifada, but Israel had him arrested for allegedly {{being involved in the}} killing of twenty-six civilians, and he was sentenced to five life terms.|$|E
5|$|Pećanac was {{the most}} {{prominent}} figure in the Chetnik movement during the interwar period. During the 1920 Constitutional Assembly elections, Prime Minister Nikola Pašić sent Pećanac to the Sandžak with orders to intimidate the local Muslim population {{in the hope of}} keeping the turnout low. In the same year, <b>attempts</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Yugoslav government to disarm and conscript Kosovo Albanians were met by revolts. Pećanac was sent to Kosovo to form detachments made up of local Serbs to fight the rebels. This resulted in rebel attacks on Serb villages.|$|E

5|$|The {{community}} {{had a long}} history of conflict with the San Francisco Police Department. Following World War II, gay bars were subject to frequent raids and <b>attempts</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control to revoke their alcohol licenses.

5|$|The {{original}} Texas Giant was {{manufactured by}} Dinn Corporation and designed by Curtis D. Summers. For {{more than a}} decade after its opening in 1990, the Texas Giant remained popular, ranking in the Golden Ticket Awards as the number one wooden roller coaster in 1998 and 1999. However, throughout the 2000s the ride's popularity declined {{as a result of the}} ride becoming rougher. Despite maintenance <b>attempts</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> park, Six Flags Over Texas announced the ride's closure in 2009. Much of the original wooden structure was kept, with the track being replaced with steel.|$|E

5|$|The panzergrenadier {{regiment}} of Großdeutschland, advancing on {{the right}} wing, pushed through {{to the village of}} Butovo. The tanks were deployed in an arrow formation to minimise the effects of the Soviet Pakfront defence, with the Tigers leading and the Panzer IIIs, IVs and assault guns fanning out to the flanks and rear. They were followed by infantry and combat engineers. <b>Attempts</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> VVS to impede the advance were repulsed by the Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|Two <b>attempts</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Japanese {{to extend}} their {{defensive}} perimeter {{in the south and}} central Pacific were thwarted in the battles of Coral Sea (May 1942) and Midway (June 1942). These two strategic victories for the Allies provided them with an opportunity to take the initiative and launch an offensive against the Japanese somewhere in the Pacific. The Allies chose the Solomon Islands, specifically the southern Solomon Islands of Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida as the location for their first offensive.|$|E
