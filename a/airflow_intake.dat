Intake manifold is one of the crucial components in induction system that would evenly distribute the air charge into the cylinder. Flow variation between cylinders could cause low engine VE. This study conducted airflow measurement using a steady airflow rig to identify the flow characteristics. The test was conducted with 4 unit intake manifolds and a cylinder head.

40|$|Recovering {{energy from}} exhaust air systems is an {{innovative}} idea. A specific {{wind turbine generator}} has been designed {{in order to achieve}} this goal. This device consists of two Giromill vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) combined with four guide vanes and two diffuser plates. The working principle of this design was simulated using the ANSYS Fluent computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package and the results were compared to the experimental ones. The result shows that the optimum position of wind turbine that produces the highest power is when the shaft of the turbine is shifted 150 mm from the centre of discharge outlet. The theoretical analysis also shows that the turbine produces highest power at this position because the positive torque area of the turbine match the highest wind velocity from the cooling tower model. It was perceived from the results that by introducing the diffusers and then the guide vanes, the overall power output of the wind turbine was improved by approximately 5 % and 34 %, respectively, compared to using VAWT alone. In the case of the diffusers, the optimum angle was found to be 7 °, while for guide vanes A and B, it was 70 ° and 60 ° respectively. These results were in good agreement with experimental results obtained in the previous experimental study. Overall, it can be concluded that exhaust air recovery turbines are a promising form of green technology. The optimization was carried out in the next step. It was aimed to optimize the overall system energy generation and simultaneously guarantee that it does not violate the cooling tower performance in terms of decreasing <b>airflow</b> <b>intake</b> and increasing fan motor power consumption. The variable factors for the optimization are the wind turbine rotor position, modifying diffuser plates, and the introduction of separator plates to the design. The generated power coefficient was selected as optimization objective. Unlike most of previous optimizations in the field of wind turbines, response surface methodology (RSM) as a method of analytical procedures optimization has been utilised in this study by using multivariate statistic techniques. Both computational and optimization results were validated by experimental data obtained in the laboratory. Results showed that the optimization strategy could improve the wind turbine generated power by 48. 6 % compared to baseline design. Meanwhile, it is able to enhance the fan intake airflow rate and decrease fan motor power consumption. The obtained optimization equations were also validated by both CFD and experimental results and a very good agreement is achieved...|$|E

The {{finite element}} {{software}} ADINA was employed {{in this paper}} to study the ventilation effect of a large cross-section cable tunnel by using a computational fluid dynamics method. The temperature and ventilation zoning inside a cable tunnel were determined according to {{the characteristics of the}} large cross-section cable tunnel. With the ambient tunnel characteristics and tunnel cross-section layout being taken into consideration, a three-dimensional model for large cross-section cable tunnels was established; the computations indicate that the main influential factors of ventilation effect of large cross-section cable tunnels are <b>intake</b> <b>airflow</b> rate, <b>intake</b> air temperature, exhaust airflow rate, ventilation duration, tunnel length, fire door layout, and so on. The average air velocity in the tunnel was about 60 % of the <b>intake</b> <b>airflow</b> rate.

The impact of EGR type, swirl and tumble <b>intake</b> <b>airflows,</b> compression ratio and fuel type were also investigated. EGR addition resulted in significant fuel consumption improvements and differing particulate matter (PM) behaviour depending on the knock limited maximum brake torque (KLMBT) spark advance achieved. When comparing EGR types, cooled EGR achieved the best fuel consumption and cooled EGR after three-way catalyst (TWC) achieved the best gaseous emissions (NOx and HC). Swirl and tumble <b>intake</b> <b>airflows</b> significantly increased fuel consumption. However, these increases could be minimized with EGR addition. Swirl significantly reduced the accumulation mode particulate emissions, providing a potential solution for PM reduction.

This intake {{is known as a}} mixed-compression inlet. However, two difficulties arise for these intakes: one occurs during engine throttling while the other occurs when the aircraft speed (or Mach) changes. If the engine is throttled back, there is a reduction in the corrected (or non-dimensional) airflow of the LP compressor/fan, but (at supersonic conditions) the corrected <b>airflow</b> at the <b>intake</b> lip remains constant, because it is determined by the flight Mach number and intake incidence/yaw. This discontinuity is overcome by the normal shock moving to a lower cross-sectional area in the ducting, to decrease the Mach number at entry to the shockwave. This weakens the shockwave, improving the overall intake pressure recovery. So, the absolute airflow stays constant, whilst the corrected airflow at compressor entry falls (because of a higher entry pressure). Excess <b>intake</b> <b>airflow</b> may also be dumped overboard or into the exhaust system, to prevent the conical/oblique shock waves being disturbed by the normal shock being forced too far forward by engine throttling.|$|R
