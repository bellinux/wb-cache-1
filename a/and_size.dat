Our {{results suggest that the}} dental epithelium and mesenchyme determine the cusp <b>size</b> <b>and</b> tooth <b>size</b> respectively <b>and</b> the cusp number is co-regulated by the tooth <b>size</b> <b>and</b> cusp <b>size.</b> It is also suggested that the mesenchymal cell number regulates not the tooth size but the tooth number.
