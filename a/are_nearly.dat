5|$|The 'core' neuroacanthocytosis syndromes are chorea acanthocytosis and McLeod syndrome. Acanthocytes <b>are</b> <b>nearly</b> {{always present}} in these {{conditions}} and they share common clinical features. Some of these features are also seen in the other neurological syndromes associated with neuroacanthocytosis.|$|E

5|$|The Polden Hills a long, low ridge, {{extending}} for , {{and separated}} from the Mendip Hills, to which they <b>are</b> <b>nearly</b> parallel, by a marshy tract, known as the Somerset Levels.

5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{production of}} steel are pieces of ironware excavated from an archaeological site in Anatolia (Kaman-Kalehoyuk) and <b>are</b> <b>nearly</b> 4,000 years old, dating from 1800 BC. Horace identifies steel weapons {{such as the}} falcata in the Iberian Peninsula, while Noric steel {{was used by the}} Roman military.|$|E

5|$|The {{magnitude}} of winds offshore <b>are</b> <b>nearly</b> double the wind speed observed onshore. This {{is attributed to}} the differences in friction between land masses and offshore waters. Sometimes, there are even directional differences, particularly if local sea breezes change the wind on shore during daylight hours.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle and}} upper reaches of Tangascootack Creek <b>are</b> <b>nearly</b> devoid of life due to acid mine drainage. However, the {{headwaters}} have some aquatic life, as they are further upstream. Brook trout and three other species of fish inhabit the creek. 13 species of benthic macroinvertebrate also inhabit it.|$|E
5|$|The {{orbits of}} Solar System planets <b>are</b> <b>nearly</b> circular. Compared to other systems, they have smaller orbital eccentricity. Although there are {{attempts}} {{to explain it}} partly with a bias in the radial-velocity detection method and partly with long interactions of a quite high number of planets, the exact causes remain undetermined.|$|E

50|$|Peaking in 1999, {{production}} of North Sea oil <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> 950,000 m³ (6 million barrels) per day. Natural gas production <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> 280×109 m³ (10 trillion cubic feet) in 2001 {{and continues to}} increase, although British gas production is in sharp decline.|$|R

Additionally, there are about 310 pupils aged from 3 to 13 at The Downs, Malvern College prep school, in nearby Colwall in Herefordshire. Across the two schools, in total, there <b>are</b> <b>nearly</b> 1000 pupils.|$|E
5|$|Upturned {{beds are}} exposed in {{sections}} of the folded Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, including exposures on the flanks and axis of the Broad Top Synclinorium in south central Pennsylvania.

5|$|After {{the liberation}} of the Netherlands, the Grave Registration units of 2nd Army began the task of {{identifying}} the British dead. They were buried together in a field that is on permanent loan to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission just north of Oosterbeek. There <b>are</b> <b>nearly</b> 1,800 graves {{in what is now}} known as the Airborne Cemetery, ¾ of which are for those killed during the 1944 battle. By 2003, there were still 138 men unaccounted for and human remains, equipment and weaponry continue to be dug up in the farmland around the city.|$|E

5|$|Bivalves {{vary greatly}} in overall shape. Some, {{such as the}} cockles, have shells that <b>are</b> <b>nearly</b> globular; cockles can jump by bending and {{straightening}} their foot. Others, such as the razor clams, are burrowing specialists with elongated shells and a powerful foot adapted for rapid digging. The shipworms, in the family Teredinidae have greatly elongated bodies, but their shell valves are much reduced and restricted to the anterior end of the body, where they function as scraping organs that permit the animal to dig tunnels through wood.|$|E
5|$|Heisenberg's {{uncertainty}} principle predicts {{that during the}} inflationary phase there would be quantum thermal fluctuations, which would be magnified to cosmic scale. These fluctuations serve as the seeds of all current structure in the universe. Inflation predicts that the primordial fluctuations <b>are</b> <b>nearly</b> scale invariant and Gaussian, which has been accurately confirmed by measurements of the CMB.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to jwé and other music performed for entertainment, Saint Lucia {{is also home}} to styles used only for specific occasions. These include work songs, drinking songs, funereal music and serenades and masquerades. The latter two traditions <b>are</b> <b>nearly</b> extinct in modern Saint Lucia. The masquerade was a celebration held near holidays like Easter and New Year's Day, which included an orchestra consisting of a tanbou tenbal, chakchak and a bamboo flute. This same ensemble also traditionally performs for cockfights, merry-go-rounds and vocal serenades, called séwinal in Lucian Creole.|$|E
50|$|Air {{pressure}} variations do {{not affect}} pitch (the ratio {{of pressure to}} air density in an ideal gas is constant. Air pressure and density changes therefore cancel, and {{have no effect on}} the speed of sound; air <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> an ideal gas, so there <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> no effect).|$|R

5|$|In the 2007–2008 school year, McGill offered over 340 {{academic}} programs in eleven faculties. The university also offers over 250 doctoral and master's graduate degree programs. Despite strong increases in university enrollment across North America, McGill has upheld {{a relatively low}} and appealing student-faculty ratio of 16:1. There <b>are</b> <b>nearly</b> 1,600 tenured or tenure-track professors teaching at the university.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} pointed out that, architecturally, both the O-13 Pyramid and the Late Classic Temple of the Inscriptions at Palenque, <b>are</b> <b>nearly</b> identical; both have {{the same number of}} {{substructure}} terraces, and both pyramids' substructures have exactly five doors. Furthermore, both pyramids were built into the sides of existing hills. Damien Marken and Kirk Straight, use this—as well as inscriptions on stelae at Palenque—to argue that {{there was some sort of}} relationship between the two polities.|$|E
