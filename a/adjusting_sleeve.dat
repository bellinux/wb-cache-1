25|$|Multi-cylinder {{hydraulic}} {{cone crusher}} is mainly composed of main frame, eccentric shaft, crushing cone, mantle, bowl liner, adjusting device, dust ring, transmission device, bowl-shaped bearing, <b>adjusting</b> <b>sleeve,</b> hydraulic control system, hydraulic safety system, etc. The electric motor of the cone crusher drives the eccentric shaft to make periodic swing movement under the shaft axis, and consequently surface of mantle approaches {{and leaves the}} surface of bowl liner now and then, so that the material is crushed due to squeezing and grinding inside the crushing chamber. The safety cylinder of the machine can ensure safety as well as lift supporting sleeve and static cone by a hydraulic system and automatically remove the blocks in the crushing chamber when the machine is suddenly stuffy. Thus the maintenance rate is greatly reduced and production efficiency is greatly improved as it can remove blocks without disassembling the machine.|$|E

5000|$|Calibration {{typically}} {{checks the}} error at 3 to 5 {{points along the}} range. Only one can be adjusted to zero. If the micrometer is in good condition, then they are all so near to zero that the instrument seems to read essentially [...] "-on" [...] all along its range; no noticeable error is seen at any locale. In contrast, on a worn-out micrometer (or one that was poorly made to begin with), one can [...] "chase the error {{up and down the}} range", that is, move it up or down to any of various locales along the range, by <b>adjusting</b> the <b>sleeve,</b> but one cannot eliminate it from all locales at once.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{show that}} the {{production}} and the geometrical shape of complex polymersomes can be predicted by varying the flow rates of a simple microdevice using an empirical law which predicts the droplet size. This device is constituted of fused silica capillaries associated with <b>adjusted</b> tubing <b>sleeves</b> and T-junctions. Studying the effect of several experimental parameters, double emulsions containing a controlled number of droplets were fabricated. First, this study examines the stability of a jet in a simple confined microfluidic system, probing the conditions required for droplets production. Then, multicompartmental polymersomes were formed, controlling flow velocities. In this work, poly(dimethylsiloxane) -graft-poly(ethylene oxide) (PDMS-g-PEO) and poly(butadiene) -block-poly(ethyleneoxide) (PBut-b-PEO) amphiphilic copolymers were used and dissolved in chloroform/cyclohexane mixture. The ratio of these two solvents was adjusted in order to stabilize the double emulsion formation. The aqueous suspension contained poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), limiting the coalescence of the droplets. This work constitutes major progress in, the control of double emulsion formation in microfluidic devices and shows that complex structures can be obtained using such a process...|$|R
40|$|Based on rock compression-shear damage theory, the {{mechanical}} characteristics of an arc blade wedged hob were analyzed {{to study the}} rock fragmentation mechanism of hob during excavation, and rock fragmentation forecasting model of the arc blade wedged hob was improved. A spoke type cutter model {{which is similar to}} the tunnel boring machine (TBM) cutter head was designed to study the rock fragmentation efficiency in different cutter spacing by <b>adjusting</b> the bearing <b>sleeve</b> size to obtain different distances between the hobs. The results show that the hob-breaking rock force mainly comes from three directions. The vertical force along the direction of the tunnel excavation, which is associated with uniaxial compressive strength of rock mass, {{plays a key role in}} the process of rock fragmentation. Field project data shows that the prediction modelâ€™s results of rock fragmentation in this paper are closer to the measured results than the results of the traditional linear cutting model. The optimal cutter spacing exists among different cutter spacings to get higher rock fragmentation rate and lower energy consumption during rock fragmentation. It is of great reference significance to design the arc blade wedged hob and enhance the efficiency of rock fragmentation in rock strata...|$|R
