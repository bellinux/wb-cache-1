40|$|Asset - Liability {{management}} {{is one of}} the most critical tasks for any financial institution for determining its cushion against the risk and the net returns. The problem of asset liability management for an insurance company requires matching the cash inflows from premium collections and investment income with the cash outflows due to casualty and maturity claims. Thus, what is required is a prudent investment strategy such that the returns earned on the <b>assets</b> <b>match</b> the liability claims at all points of time in future. Conventionally, the asset allocation has been done using the Mean Variance approach due to Markowitz (1952, 1959). While such a strategy ensures that the <b>asset</b> value always <b>match</b> or are greater than the liability for the next year, it does not maximise the net worth of the firm nor does it take care of all the cash inflows and outflows over a long term period. A stochastic linear programming model (on the lines of Pirbhai, 2004) maximises the net worth of the firm and also takes care of the uncertainties. While there are instances of stochastic linear programming being applied for ALM in financial institutions in developed markets, no such practical application has been reported in this area in Indian context as yet. In this paper, we describe the development of a multi stage stochastic linear programming model for insurance companies. The multi-stage stochastic linear programming model was developed on the modelling language AMPL (Fourer, 2002). ...|$|R

40|$|Both Anderson and Gatignon and the Uppsala {{internationalization}} model see {{the initial}} mode of foreign market entry and subsequent {{modes of operation}} as unilaterally determined by multinational enterprises (MNEs) arbitraging control and risk and increasing their commitment as they gain experience in the target market. OLI and internalization models do recognize that foreign market entry requires the bundling of MNE and complementary local assets, which they call location or country-specific advantages, but implicitly assume that those assets are freely accessible to MNEs. In contrast to both of these MNE-centric views, I explicitly consider the transactional characteristics of complementary local assets and model foreign market entry as the optimal assignment of equity between their owners and MNEs. By looking at the relative efficiency of the different markets in which MNE and complementary local assets are traded, and at how these two categories of <b>assets</b> <b>match,</b> I am able to predict whether equity will be held by MNEs or by local firms, or shared between them, and whether MNEs will enter through greenfields, brownfields, or acquisitions.

This paper is concerned with a model about capital misallocation and its influencing factors of integrated financing, capital operation, and investment performance. We take 7096 observations of 646 Chinese listed companies during fiscal years 2003 to 2014 for A-shares on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchange, for instance, to empirically test the microscopic influencing factors of capital misallocation under different external financing dependence. The study illustrates the following: (1) in descriptive statistics of different industries capital misallocation, more than half of firms experience the circumstance of capital misallocation; (2) although Chinese listed companies are faced with financing constraints, capital market inefficiency, and other issues, most companies still depend on external financing; (3) the main factors that affect capital misallocation of the listed companies are financial liquidity and financial pledgeability; (4) the firms with high innovation abilities generally have stronger profitability, superior financial liquidity, and better financial pledgeability, thus reducing corporate capital misallocation; (5) the Chinese listed companies with large-scale assets and strong profitability easily obtain bank loans and equity financing, while violating the principle of <b>assets</b> <b>matching...</b>|$|R
40|$|The U. S. economy's nonfinancial {{debt ratio}} has risen since 1980 {{to a level}} that is {{extraordinary}} in comparison with prior historical experience. Approximately one-half of this rise has consisted of increased indebtedness (relative to income) of borrowers in the economy's private sector, including both individuals and businesses, and it therefore at least potentially represents {{an increase in the}} economy-wide exposure to debt default. The U. S. household sector as a whole has increased its holdings of liquid and other readily marketable assets, so that in the aggregate its balance sheet is no less sound than before, but available data make it doubtful that the distribution of the additional <b>assets</b> <b>matches</b> the distribution of the additional debt closely enough to avoid debt service problems {{in the event of a}} general economic contraction. By contrast, in the case of businesses, including especially the corporate sector, there are no additional <b>assets</b> to <b>match</b> the additional liabilities, so that balance sheets as well as incomes have become more leveraged. The chief implication of this increased exposure to the threat of financial instability is not only that the U. S. economy is likely to be more prone to financial instability in the event of a major business contraction, but also [...] and perhaps more importantly [...] that, as a result, U. S. economic policymakers are likely to be more reluctant either to seek or to tolerate a business recession in the first place. Experience suggests that it will be difficult 'to balance the desire to avoid economic downturns with the ability to avoid occasional periods of aggregate excess demand, so that this increased reluctance to tolerate recessions probably implies a more expansionary monetary policy on average than would otherwise be the case. Experience also suggests that a plausible result of such a no-recession monetary policy, sustained over time, is price inflation. This process is self-limiting, however, in that over time inflation reduces the real value of the private sector's outstanding nominal indebtedness, hence reducing the risk of financial instability, and thereby removing the source of policymakers' increased reluctance to tolerate recessions. ...|$|R

40|$|In a two-country {{portfolio}} {{model with}} leverage constraints, I focus on private assets {{in order to}} understand how their behaviour can justify an expected excess return as well as the flight-to-safety observed in the data. The specific goal is to study how much these phenomena are {{explained by the fact that}} investors cannot always borrow the same amount of resources pledging domestic assets as pledging foreign collateral. Modeling the leverage constraints accordingly, I propose a methodology to deal with this heterogeneous pledgeability and solve for country portfolios. The central feature of this approach is that any idiosyncratic shocks generate an expected excess returns which compensate the current effects of the shock on the relative riskiness of local versus foreign collateral. The resulting portfolio solution shows that, in equilibrium, investors care for this risk and renounce to a part of the expected excess return - favouring current borrowing. The main consequences are: the home equity bias is smaller than in a model where assets are homogeneously pledgeable; the ex post dynamics of the relative premium paid on collateralized assets contribute to the cross-border transmission of shocks. Given these dynamics, idiosyncratic shocks to the pledgeability of local assets affect the value of external claims and liabilities of the country hit by the shock in such a way that its net foreign <b>assets</b> <b>match</b> those observed in the data during times of flight-to-safety. portfolio choice, riskiness of pledged collateral, return di¤erentials, macroeconomic interdependence...|$|R
