5|$|A {{group that}} opposed the hippie {{movement}} {{managed to keep}} Guldy off the mayoral ballot in 1975. He became a write-in candidate for village trustee, with his friend, poet George Montgomery, running for mayor. Montgomery lost the election to Raivo Puusemp, a sculptor from SoHo. After his election, Puusemp chided Guldy for being a poor role model for the village youth. Puusemp was not a native of Rosendale and had not lived there long. By early July 1975, Puusemp had appointed a village dog warden after a dog bit a child and was <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> about the streets unrestrained.|$|E
5|$|Elections {{were held}} in early October from which all {{political}} parties were barred from participating. Castillo Armas was the only candidate; he won the election with 99% of the vote, completing his transition into power. Castillo Armas became affiliated with a party named the Movimiento de Liberación Nacional (MLN), which remained the ruling party of Guatemala from 1954 to 1957. It was led by Mario Sandoval Alarcón, and was a coalition of municipal politicians, bureaucrats, coffee planters, {{and members of the}} military, all of whom were opposed to the reforms of the Guatemalan Revolution. In the congressional elections held under Castillo Armas, it was the only party <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>run.</b>|$|E
5|$|In early 1996, the Hunter Mariners {{club was}} officially launched, without a home ground, {{but on that}} same day the Super League was banned from running its rebel competition. Originally the Mariners were allowed to use the Newcastle Knights home ground Marathon Stadium by the Showground Trust, but the Supreme Court found {{that they had no}} rights to play there. The club {{eventually}} played at Topper Stadium, sharing the ground with the National Soccer League's Newcastle Breakers, and used over $1 million to upgrade facilities at the stadium. After an appeal in mid-1996, the Super League was officially <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the competition, which began in 1997.|$|E

5|$|On 21 February 2016, a {{referendum}} {{was held on}} the question of whether Morales should be <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for a fourth term when his third term would expire in 2020 which he narrowly lost. His approval rating had been damaged by the allegations concerning his relationship with Gabriela Zapata Montaño. In December 2016 the MAS nominated Morales as their candidate for the 2019 presidential election regardless, stating that they would seek various avenues to ensure that this would be legal.|$|E
5|$|Stallions must be {{registered}} New Foresters, {{and are not}} <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> free all year round on the Forest. They normally are turned out only for a limited period {{in the spring and}} summer, when they gather several groups of mares and youngstock into larger herds and defend them against other stallions. A small number (usually fewer than 50) are turned out, generally between May and August. This ensures that foals are born neither too early (before the spring grass is coming through), nor too late (as the colder weather is setting in and the grazing and browsing on the Forest is dying back) in the following year.|$|E
5|$|The Peronist party, proscribed since 1955, was <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for the 1973 elections. The Peronist party won the elections, and Héctor Cámpora became president. Rodríguez Saá {{became a}} provincial legislator, {{and led the}} Peronist deputies in the chamber. He joined the right-wing Peronist unions, led by Oraldo Britos. He opposed the {{governor}} Elías Adre, who was aligned with left-wing Peronism. After the 1976 Argentine coup d'état, he left politics and worked in a law firm with his brother.|$|E

5|$|While games such as Street Fighter and Tekken require {{players to}} {{memorize}} relatively lengthy and complicated button-input combinations often specific {{to only a}} particular character, Super Smash Bros. uses the same control combinations to access all moves for all characters. Characters are additionally not limited to only facing opponents, instead being <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> around freely on the stage. The game focuses more on aerial and platforming skills than other fighting games, with relatively larger, more-dynamic stages rather than a simple flat platform. Smash Bros. also implements blocking and dodging mechanics. Grabbing and throwing other characters is also possible.|$|E
5|$|Keeping {{his promise}} to Milk, newly elected Mayor George Moscone {{appointed}} him to the Board of Permit Appeals in 1976, making him the first openly gay city commissioner in the United States. Milk, however, considered seeking {{a position in the}} California State Assembly. The district was weighted heavily in his favor, as much of it was based in neighborhoods surrounding Castro Street, where Milk's sympathizers voted. In the previous race for supervisor, Milk received more votes than the currently seated assemblyman. However, Moscone had made a deal with the assembly speaker that another candidate should run—Art Agnos. Furthermore, by order of the mayor, neither appointed nor elected officials were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> a campaign while performing their duties.|$|E
5|$|Military {{personnel}} were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for and serve in political office while remaining on active duty. However {{they did not}} represent the Army or the Armada, but were instead expected to {{serve the interests of}} the city or province which had elected them. PedroI chose nine military officers as Senators and appointed five (out of fourteen) to the Council of State. During the Regency, two were named to the Senate and none to the Council of State (this body was dormant during the Regency). PedroII chose four officers as Senators during the 1840s, two in the 1850s and three others during the remaining years of his reign. He also appointed seven officers to be State Councilors during the 1840s and 1850s, and three others after that.|$|E

5|$|The first {{constitution}} of 1803 allowed governors to serve for two three-year terms, limited to six of any eight years, commencing {{on the first}} Monday in the December following an election. The current {{constitution of}} 1851 removed the term limit, and shifted {{the start of the}} term to the second Monday in January following an election. In 1908, Ohio switched from holding elections in odd-numbered years to even-numbered years, with the preceding governor (from the 1905 election) serving an extra year. A 1957 amendment lengthened the term to four years and allowed governors to only succeed themselves once, having to wait four years after their second term in a row before being <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> again. An Ohio Supreme Court ruling in 1973 clarified this to mean governors could theoretically serve unlimited terms, as long as they waited four years after every second term.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} the band were raised in Bayonne, a city on the south west coast of France (Pyrénées-Atlantiques/French Basque Country). The {{surrounding}} scenic countryside and rugged coastline inspired Gojira's interest in nature and the earth. Gojira use their lyrics to spread its spiritual beliefs and concerns for the environment. They also cooperate with Sea Shepherd Conservation Society to protect marine animals, especially dolphins, whales, and sharks. Members from Sea Shepherd Conservation Society are <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> a merchandise booth at Gojira gigs.

All proceeds from the project go to the organization, though as of June 2016 the current status of this project is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Burnet {{was opposed}} {{to the use of}} nuclear power in Australia owing to the issues of nuclear proliferation. He later {{retracted}} his objections to uranium mining in Australia, feeling that nuclear power was necessary while other renewable energy sources were being developed. In the late 1960s and 1970s, he was also vocal in the anti-smoking movement; {{he was one of the}} first high-profile figures in Australia to educate the public on the dangers of tobacco, and he appeared in a television advertisement criticising the ethics of tobacco advertising, and broadcasters for displaying such material. He and fellow activists were surprised that the commercial was <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> briefly, before being taken off air by the station, which only further generated attention for the anti-smoking campaign. A former smoker, he had rejected the habit in the 1950s after several friends died. Burnet was also a critic of the Vietnam War and called for the creation of an international police force.|$|E

5|$|Carlos Menem {{ran for a}} {{new term}} as {{president}} in 2003, and Eduardo Duhalde tried to prevent it. Instead of holding primary elections within the PJ, the 2003 elections used {{a variant of the}} Ley de Lemas. All the Peronist candidates were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> in the general election, using their own tickets. Although Kirchner ran for president with Duhalde's support, he was not the president's first choice. Trying to prevent a third term for Menem, Duhalde approached Santa Fe governor Carlos Reutemann and Córdoba governor José Manuel de la Sota; Reutemann declined, and De la Sota did not run because he was insufficiently popular. Duhalde also unsuccessfully approached Mauricio Macri, Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, Felipe Solá, and Roberto Lavagna, all of whom refused to run. Duhalde initially resisted supporting Kirchner, fearing that Kirchner would ignore him if elected. Kirchner run on the Front for Victory ticket, one of the several fronts put up by the PJ. Since Kirchner was identified with the centre-left, Duhalde appointed the centre-right Daniel Scioli as his vice-presidential candidate. Only a handful of Peronist governors supported either candidate; most remained neutral, awaiting the election to forge a relationship with the victor.|$|E
5|$|The trains were {{delivered}} late, and {{were put into}} service after the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate had given dispensation from parts of the safety regulation. On 17 June 2000, a train derailed at Nelaug Station after an axle broke. The class was grounded for a month, and the investigation showed both design errors, and lack of proper inspection and testing. After they were put back into service, they {{were not allowed to}} use the tilting mechanism—thus not being <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> faster than their predecessors. The construction was reinforced, and in 2004, the tilting mechanism was re-enabled along with higher speeds. In 2007, a train derailed on the Bergen Line, and questions were raised about the trains' ability to operate in snow, however the accident report showed that the trains' front axle load was just as able to cope with heavy snow conditions as the locomotives running on the line, and that the derailment would have been more severe if the same conditions would hit a normal train with less secure connections between carriages. On 16 June 2011, two units were destroyed when the train ran into a fire in a snow tunnel at Hallingskeid Station.|$|E
25|$|Partly due to Díaz' lengthy tenure, {{the current}} Mexican {{constitution}} limits {{a president to}} a single six-year term with no possibility of re-election, {{even if it is}} nonconsecutive. Additionally, no one who holds the post, even on a caretaker basis, is <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> or serve again. This provision is so entrenched that it remained in place even after legislators were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for a second consecutive term.|$|E
