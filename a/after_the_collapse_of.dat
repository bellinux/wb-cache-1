In the 1930s Finland purchased Thornycroft torpedo boats from the United Kingdom, and also refrained from buying bomber aircraft from Germany because of British protests, purchasing instead modern Bristol Blenheims, which later served successfully during the Winter War.|$|E

40|$|Once {{circulating}} beams {{have been}} established in the LHC the first step towards collisions is to remove the physical separation used to avoid collisions during injection and ramp. A residual separation can remain <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapsing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> separation bumps. The so-called Van Der Meer method allows for a minimization of this unwanted separation by transversally scanning one beam through the other. The beam sizes at the IP can also be determined by this method and used to give an absolute measurement of the luminosity. We report on how this measurement was implemented and performed in the LHC to optimize and calibrate luminosity...|$|R

The threat to Gibraltar was greatly reduced <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> Italy in September 1943.|$|E
5|$|In January 1940, the U-boats opened another offensive. Some 21 Submarines sank 42 ships. All were east of 11°W, {{and thus}} {{within range of}} the Command’s aircraft. The {{situation}} worsened, {{although it was not}} disastrous until <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> France. The need for long-range aircraft was identified by the first success of Coastal Command. A No. 228 Squadron Sunderland sighted a U-boat, , enable to submerge after sinking three ships. It directed Destroyers to engage it. U-55 was scuttled. Had {{it not been for the}} Sunderland, the submarine would have escaped.|$|E
