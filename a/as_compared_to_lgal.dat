Measures used were developed for the study. Data were collected by means of questionnaires mailed to a selected sample of married women of Norwegian descent or whose husbands were of Norwegian descent, and were analyzed for statistical significance by means of simple correlation and the Behrens-Fisher test. Ethnic article ownership {{was found to be}} significantly related to ethnicity as expressed by ethnic practices, and to generation in America (first <b>as</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> second), travel to the mother country, and communication with relatives. No significant relations were found to obtain in the cases of ethnicity as expressed by ethnic attitudes, or of generation in America (second <b>as</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> third), marital status (endogamy <b>as</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> exogamy), educational level, and social class level...|$|R
50|$|The {{population}} was 300 {{according to the}} last census in 2007 (-9% <b>as</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the 1999 census), with 48% men and 52% women, 26.5% {{of the total population}} is single. About 8.3% of the {{population was}} unemployed in 2007 <b>as</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> 11.2% in 1999.|$|R
30|$|From {{the results}} of deflections, it is {{concluded}} that type of precast connections adopted in the study is more ductile <b>as</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> monolithic connection. Deflection corresponding to maximum load is 11.26, 49.46, and 33.63  % more for specimen PC-CRW, PC-CRS, and PC-BRS, respectively, <b>as</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> monolithic connection.|$|R
30|$|The {{mitochondrial}} respiration in PBMC was significantly reduced in high risk infection patients <b>as</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> healthy controls, especially in reserve capacity (maximal respiration and spare respiratory capacity). There {{was also a}} trend towards reduced {{mitochondrial respiration}} in low risk infection patients <b>as</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> healthy controls (Fig. 1).|$|R
30|$|The {{relative}} log odds {{will increase}} for the individuals having technical education for formal training <b>as</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the individuals without technical education. Technical education {{does not have}} a significant effect in the case of informal training. Apart from ‘Other’ religions, the relative log odds decrease for Islam and Christianity <b>as</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the Hindu religion individuals for receiving informal training. On the other hand, the relative log odds of Christianity and Other religions are higher than Hinduism in the case of formal training. The relative log odds increase for all social groups <b>as</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the STs for both formal and informal training. The relative log odds increase for both secondary and tertiary sector <b>as</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the primary sector. This result holds true for both formal and informal training.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} lead and cadmium on seed germination, {{seedling}}, root, shoot length and seedling dry biomass of Albizia lebbeck was evaluated under laboratory conditions {{with and without}} lead and cadmium treatments. Lead and cadmium treatments at 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90 µmol/L affected seed germination and seedling growth of A. lebbeck <b>as</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> control. Lead treatments at 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90 µmol/L concentrations produced significant (p< 0. 05) effects on seed germination and seedling length of A. lebbeck while lead treatment at 50 µmol/L significantly affected root growth and seedling dry biomass <b>as</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> control. Similarly, cadmium treatments from 10 to 90 µmol/L affected the seed germination, root, shoot length and seedling dry biomass of A. lebbeck <b>as</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> control. Seedlings vigor index of A. lebbeck showed gradual decrease with increase in concentration of lead and cadmium. Cadmium treatments showed adverse effects on seedlings of A. lebbeck <b>as</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> lead. Lead and cadmium treatments at 90 µmol/L exhibited lowest percentage of tolerance in seedlings of A. lebbeck <b>as</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> control...|$|R
