5|$|<b>A</b> <b>cooperative</b> Half-Life {{game was}} first alluded to by {{publisher}} Sierra On-Line in November 2000 with {{the announcement of}} a PlayStation 2 version of Half-Life. At the time, however, it was unclear how <b>a</b> <b>cooperative</b> version of Half-Life would be implemented; the developers, Gearbox Software, were still experimenting with finding the most balanced number of players to build <b>a</b> <b>cooperative</b> game around. By E3 2001, the game had acquired the title Decay, named after the scientific concept of exponential decay for consistency with the scientific names used by previous Half-Life titles. While the E3 convention only provided {{a demonstration of the}} main Half-Life PlayStation 2 game, further details were released relating to Decays premise and story, as well as confirming that the cooperative mode was to be designed for two players. The game's use of new model sets were also showcased. These new models were updated versions of Gearbox's High Definition pack for , featuring higher numbers of polygons and animation features such as facial expressions. The enhanced models were around twice as detailed as those in the High Definition pack, which itself was of a much higher quality than the original models in Half-Life. Media updates through the months following E3 showed various screenshots and the trailer to the game. On August 18, 2001, Sierra announced that Decay was nearly complete, and would be submitted to PlayStation 2 manufacturer Sony for verification within days. The entire Half-Life for PlayStation 2 package achieved gold status on October 30, 2001, and the game was released on November 14, 2001.|$|E

5|$|Cooperativity is {{observed}} when two synapses are activated by weak stimuli incapable of inducing LTP when stimulated individually. But upon simultaneous weak stimulation, both synapses undergo LTP in <b>a</b> <b>cooperative</b> fashion. Synaptic tagging {{does not explain}} how multiple weak stimuli can result in a collective stimulus sufficient to induce LTP (this is explained by the postsynaptic summation of EPSPs described previously). Rather, synaptic tagging explains the ability of weakly stimulated synapses, none of which are capable of independently generating LTP, to receive the products of protein synthesis initiated collectively. As before, this may be accomplished through the synthesis of a local synaptic tag following weak synaptic stimulation.|$|E
