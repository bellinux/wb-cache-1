5|$|Because of the {{differences}} in the metabolic pathways of NAD biosynthesis between organisms, such as between bacteria and humans, this area of metabolism is a promising area for the development of new antibiotics.

5|$|Domains are a {{relatively}} new grouping. First proposed in 1977, Carl Woese's three-domain system was not generally accepted until later. One main characteristic of the three-domain method is the separation of Archaea <b>and</b> <b>Bacteria,</b> previously grouped into the single kingdom Bacteria (a kingdom also sometimes called Monera), with the Eukaryota for all organisms whose cells contain a nucleus. A small number of scientists include a sixth kingdom, Archaea, but do not accept the domain method.|$|E

5|$|A common {{claim of}} creationists is that {{evolution}} {{has never been}} observed. Challenges to such objections often come down to debates over how evolution is defined (see the Defining evolution section above). Under the conventional biological definition of evolution, {{it is a simple}} matter to observe evolution occurring. Evolutionary processes, in the form of populations changing their genetic composition from generation to generation, have been observed in different scientific contexts, including the evolution of fruit flies, mice, <b>and</b> <b>bacteria</b> in the laboratory, and of tilapia in the field. Such studies on experimental evolution, particularly those using microorganisms, are now providing important insights into how evolution occurs, {{especially in the case of}} antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|A frog's skin is protective, has a {{respiratory}} function, {{can absorb}} water and helps control body temperature. It has many glands, {{particularly on the}} head and back, which often exude distasteful and toxic substances (granular glands). The secretion is often sticky and helps keep the skin moist, protects against the entry of moulds <b>and</b> <b>bacteria,</b> and make the animal slippery and more able to escape from predators. The skin is shed every few weeks. It usually splits {{down the middle of the}} back and across the belly, and the frog pulls its arms and legs free. The sloughed skin is then worked towards the head where it is quickly eaten.|$|E
5|$|Although fat is {{a common}} way of storing energy, in {{vertebrates}} such as humans the fatty acids in these stores cannot be converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis as these organisms cannot convert acetyl-CoA into pyruvate; plants do, but animals do not, have the necessary enzymatic machinery. As a result, after long-term starvation, vertebrates need to produce ketone bodies from fatty acids to replace glucose in tissues such as the brain that cannot metabolize fatty acids. In other organisms such as plants <b>and</b> <b>bacteria,</b> this metabolic problem is solved using the glyoxylate cycle, which bypasses the decarboxylation step in the citric acid cycle and allows the transformation of acetyl-CoA to oxaloacetate, {{where it can be}} used for the production of glucose.|$|E

5|$|Archaea <b>and</b> <b>bacteria</b> have {{generally}} similar cell structure, but cell composition and organization set the archaea apart. Like bacteria, archaea lack interior membranes and organelles. Like bacteria, the cell membranes of archaea are usually bounded by a cell wall and they swim using {{one or more}} flagella. Structurally, archaea are most similar to gram-positive bacteria. Most have a single plasma membrane and cell wall, and lack a periplasmic space; the exception to this general rule is Ignicoccus, which possess a particularly large periplasm that contains membrane-bound vesicles and is enclosed by an outer membrane.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria often {{attach to}} {{surfaces}} and form dense aggregations called biofilms, and larger formations known as microbial mats. These biofilms and mats {{can range from}} a few micrometres in thickness to up to half a metre in depth, and may contain multiple species of bacteria, protists and archaea. Bacteria living in biofilms display a complex arrangement of cells and extracellular components, forming secondary structures, such as microcolonies, through which there are networks of channels to enable better diffusion of nutrients. In natural environments, such as soil or the surfaces of plants, the majority of bacteria are bound to surfaces in biofilms. Biofilms are also important in medicine, as these structures are often present during chronic bacterial infections or in infections of implanted medical devices, <b>and</b> <b>bacteria</b> protected within biofilms are much harder to kill than individual isolated bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches are {{generally}} omnivorous; the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana), for example, feeds {{on a great}} variety of foodstuffs including bread, fruit, leather, starch in book bindings, paper, glue, skin flakes, hair, dead insects and soiled clothing. Many species of cockroach harbor symbiotic protozoans <b>and</b> <b>bacteria</b> in their gut which are able to digest cellulose. In many species, these symbionts may be essential if the insect is to utilize cellulose; however, some species secrete cellulase in their saliva, and the wood-eating cockroach, Panesthia cribrata, is able to survive indefinitely on a diet of crystallized cellulose while being free of micro-organisms.|$|E
