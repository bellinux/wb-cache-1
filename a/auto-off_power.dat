50|$|In October 1997, AlphaSmart, Inc. {{introduced}} {{the third generation}} of the AlphaSmart family, the AlphaSmart 2000. Along with a more ergonomic design, {{the case of the}} AlphaSmart 2000 was curvy and blue. New features added were spell-checking, direct printing (allowing a user to plug into a printer directly, bypassing a computer), <b>auto-off</b> <b>power</b> save, and a keyboarding timer. A year later, the company added infrared capability to the 2000, enabling users to transfer text to a computer or another AlphaSmart without a cable. This model needed 3 AA batteries, but could still use the original rechargeable NiCd battery pack. Like the Alphasmart Pro, it had a 128 kB memory.|$|E
