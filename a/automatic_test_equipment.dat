The size of test sets for ASICs are often a large as several giga bytes, the time spent to down load test data therefore is significant. An approach to reduce the down load time is to compress data before the download. Since ATE should have accurate data and also, ATEs are slow, the compression algorithm should be non lossy and decompression should be time efficient. To achieve this, a conventional method, Burrows and Wheeler (BW) Transformation along with Run Length Coding (RLC) has been in use.

Under various load conditions, a high-performance programmable AC power source not only can generate very clean sinusoidal output voltages, but also to accurately synthesise specified harmonic distorted wave-shapes. Digital repetitive control (RC) can achieve zero steady-state error tracking of any periodic signal with known integer period, but usually fails to provide precise tracking of variable-frequency periodical waveform with fractional period. In this study, a frequency adaptive fractional-order RC (FORC) strategy at fixed sampling rate is proposed to track or eliminate any periodic signals with variable frequency, where a Lagrange interpolation-based fractional delay filter is used to approximate the factional delay items in RC. The proposed FORC that offers fast on-line tuning of the fractional delay and the fast update of the coefficients, provide a simple but high-performance real-time control {{approach to dealing with}} variable-frequency variable-magnitude periodic signals. A case study of FORC-based programmable AC power source is conducted. Experimental results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed FORC strategy.

40|$|Abstract—We have {{developed}} a MEMS probe-card technology for wafer-level testing ICs with 1 -D line-arrayed or 2 -D area-arrayed dense pads layouts. With a novel metal MEMS fabrication technique, an area-arrayed tip matrix is realized with an ultra-dense tip pitch of 90 μm × 196 μm for testing 2 -D pad layout, and a 50 -μm minimum pitch is also achieved in line-arrayed probe cards for testing line-on-center or line-on-perimeter wafers. By us-ing the anisotropic etching properties of single-crystalline silicon, novel oblique concave cavities are formed as electroplating moulds for the area-arrayed microprobes. With the micromachined cavity moulds, the probes are firstly electroplated in a silicon wafer and further flip-chip packaged onto a low-temperature cofired ceramic board for signal feeding to an <b>automatic</b> <b>testing</b> <b>equipment.</b> The microprobes can be efficiently released using a silicon-loss tech-nique with a lateral underneath etching. The measured material properties of the electroplated nickel and the Sn–Ag solder bump are promising for IC testing applications. Mechanical tests have verified that the microprobes can withstand a 65 -mN probing force, while the tip displacement is 25 μm, and can reliably work for more than 100 000 touchdowns. The electric test shows that the probe array can provide a low contact resistance of below 1 Ω, while the current leakage is only 150 pA at 3. 3 V for adjacent probes.

40|$|Integrated {{circuits}} (ICs) {{are usually}} tested during manufacture {{by means of}} <b>automatic</b> <b>testing</b> <b>equipment</b> (ATE) employing probe cards and needles that make repeated physical contact with the ICs under test. Such direct-contact probing is very costly and imposes limitations {{on the use of}} ATE. For example, the probe needles must be frequently cleaned or replaced, and some emerging technologies such as three-dimensional ICs cannot be probed at all. As an alternative to conventional probe-card testing, wireless testing has been proposed. It mitigates many of the foregoing problems by replacing probe needles and contact points with wireless communication circuits. However, wireless testing also raises new problems which are poorly understood such as: What is the most suitable wireless communication technique to employ, and how well does it work in practice? This dissertation addresses the design and implementation of circuits to support wireless testing of ICs. Various wireless testing methods are investigated and evaluated with respect to their practicality. The research focuses on near-field capacitive communication because of its efficiency over the very short ranges needed during IC manufacture. A new capacitive channel model including chip separation, cross-talk, and misalignment effects is proposed and validated using electro-magnetic simulation studies to provide the intuitions for efficient antenna and circuit design. We propose a compact clock and data recovery architecture to avoid a dedicated clock channel. An analytical model which predicts the DC-level fluctuation due to the capacitive channel is presented. Based on this model, feed-forward clock selection is designed to enhance performance. A method to select proper channel termination is discussed to maximize the channel efficiency for return-to-zero signaling. Two prototype ICs incorporating wireless testing systems were fabricated and tested with the proposed methods of testing digital circuits. Both successfully demonstrated gigahertz communication speeds with a bit-error rate less than 10 ^− 11. A third prototype IC containing analog voltage measurement circuits was implemented to determine the feasibility of wirelessly testing analog circuits. The fabricated prototype achieved satisfactory voltage measurement with 1 mV resolution. Our work demonstrates the validity of the proposed models and the feasibility of near-field capacitive communication for wireless testing of ICs...|$|R

40|$|The {{business}} {{markets of}} today are continuously becoming more globalized making {{the quality of}} delivered products and services more important for companies to achieve customer satisfaction and long-term business growth. One essential part of quality work {{is to reduce the}} costs of poor quality which is partially represented by yield loss. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate why yield loss occurs in manufacturing of radio base stations at Nanjing Communications and how it can be reduced. The work of the thesis was limited to one product group and carried out as an improvement project in accordance to the five phases of Six Sigma’s DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control). Yield loss of radio base stations at Nanjing Communications is measured {{at the end of the}} assembly process where 100 percent of the radio base stations are connected to <b>automatic</b> <b>testing</b> <b>equipment</b> and run through a series of <b>automatic</b> <b>tests.</b> A radio base station that fails to pass the first series of tests is considered a failed product and thereby contributes to yield loss. In the define phase the average yield loss for the past ten weeks was calculated as 83 percent and compared to the target level of 90 percent. A high-level understanding of the assembly and testing process was also created through a SIPOC map. The measure phase established a more detailed understanding of assembly and testing by creation of process flow charts for the whole process. A more detailed understanding of the test procedure was also developed by mapping the different connection interfaces between the radio base station and the test station. This description also made it clear that the test can be divided into test groups consisting of test points which in turn consist of individual test cases constituting measurement values and limits. The flow of information around the test process was also mapped to provide knowledge of where necessary data could be found and collected. The analyze phase started with a breakdown of yield loss where measurement values categorized as outliers were found to represent a large portion of yield loss. Looking into the outliers-category, radio base stations with no fault code given (products that have failed the first test and passed a retest without any action) was identified as interesting. Through brainstorming and an affinity diagram workshop, about causes to outliers with no fault code given, connection issues and different measurement values were highlighted for analysis. Further construction and analysis of Pareto charts showed that some interface connections and measurement values were more frequently involved in outliers with no fault code given. By looking into test points for relevant interface connections and combining these with measurement values the test point External Alarm Check was found relevant for root-cause analysis. An initial time series analysis of the occurrence of External Alarm Check did not lead to any clear root-causes. Through further investigation of the problem together with a test engineer in the production it was identified that the test point failure was caused by improper connection of two cables used during the test. Further analysis of what could cause this improper connection indicated problems with missing connection checks, routing of cables, fixing of <b>test</b> <b>equipment,</b> connector design, and maintenance routines. The analysis of this test point also highlighted problems related to unclear working routines and insufficient documentation of actions for products that pass a retest. Based on the findings the improve phase focused on developing improvement suggestions to minimize the impact from identified issues. Nanjing Communications were recommended to stabilize and align the test station environment, use connection checks for all test points, develop robust connectors, evaluate maintenance routines, standardize retest procedures, and ensure documentation of actions. At last the control phase emphasized the importance of communication between different production sites in relation to suggested improvements as well as ensuring that implemented improvements are standardized and documented for future work.
