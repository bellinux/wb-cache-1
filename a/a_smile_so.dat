500|$|William John Harper {{was born}} on 22 July 1916 in Calcutta, British India, scion of an old and {{prominent}} Anglo-Indian merchant family that had been based in the subcontinent for generations, working with the East India Company during the 18th and 19th centuries. He was educated at North Point in Darjeeling, India, and in the English town of Windsor. He grew into a short but tough man who spoke with clipped diction. Nathan Shamuyarira wrote of him in 1966 that [...] "his tight mouth rarely relaxes into <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> <b>so...</b> he seems always {{on the point of}} losing his temper".|$|E
60|$|The jolly seaman’s face {{broke into}} <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b> <b>So</b> also did {{the faces of}} the jolly seaman’s friends.|$|E
60|$|She {{gave him}} the hand which Arthur had seized upon. I think that we had none of us before seen <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>so</b> {{dazzling}} as hers.|$|E
60|$|Chapple did {{not deny}} it. He stood on one foot and <b>smiled</b> <b>a</b> propitiating <b>smile.</b> <b>So</b> far Mr. Seymour was {{entitled}} to demand a cigar or cocoanut every time.|$|R
60|$|Yellowhammer {{was made}} up of men who took off their hats to <b>a</b> <b>smiling</b> loser; <b>so</b> they invited Cherokee to say what he wanted.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Do {{you suppose}} I fear?’ she cried, {{and looked at}} him with such a {{heightened}} colour, such bright eyes, and <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> of <b>so</b> abstruse <b>a</b> meaning, that the Baron discarded his last doubt.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, if I see you {{in front}} tomorrow, I'll give you half <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> <b>so</b> that you shan't feel you haven't got your money's worth. Good night, George!' ...|$|E
6000|$|At last Marcia {{lifted her}} head, and looked {{her father in}} the face with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>so</b> pitiful that he could not bear to meet it. [...] "Well, father?" [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-night," [...] she said, with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>so</b> charming that I {{wanted to}} stop and tell her {{something}} about Mary Talbot's brother; but she passed on, and I went into my room.|$|E
60|$|EILEEN (trying {{to force}} <b>a</b> <b>smile).</b> Oh, I'm <b>so</b> glad--for your sake; but--I'm selfish--it'll be so lonely here without you.|$|R
6000|$|She {{stared at}} him fixedly, and he {{returned}} the look with <b>an</b> evil <b>smile.</b> <b>So</b> they sat in silence a moment. Then slowly she arose and moved to her escritoire, drawing {{a sheet of paper}} toward her and beginning to write. [...] "Is there a telephone at the place?" [...] enquired Mershone abruptly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it, my boy," [...] {{returned}} Charlie, with <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> [...] "and <b>so,</b> {{for better}} security, I {{have given it}} in charge to our old chum, Ralph Ritson." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My darlings--don't cry; smile!" [...] And {{the eyes}} closed again. On her face <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>so</b> {{touching}} that it rent the heart flickered and went out. Breath {{had ceased to}} pass the faded lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "Foolish man!" [...] exclaimed Bartong, with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>so</b> {{peculiar}} that Magadar did {{not feel}} quite sure that his remark was sincere. [...] "But has he not left your tribe? I heard our steersman say something about that." ...|$|E
60|$|General Wilkinson availed {{himself of}} that honor, and {{encompassed}} me with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>so</b> benignant, so winning in its candor, that I could only mutter my acknowledgment, and Colonel Clark must needs apologize, laughing, for my youth and timidity.|$|E
60|$|Jeanne smiled {{upon him}} brilliantly. It was <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> which came <b>so</b> seldom, and which, {{when it did}} come, {{transformed}} her face so utterly, that she seemed like a different person.|$|R
60|$|She turned {{towards him}} {{suddenly}} and <b>smiled.</b> <b>A</b> <b>smile</b> apparently <b>so</b> rare to that proud little mouth and those dark, melancholy eyes; <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> that disclosed the smallest and whitest of teeth in such dazzling {{contrast to the}} shadow of her face; <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> that even after its brightness had passed still left its memory in a dimple in either nut-brown cheek, and a glistening moisture in the dark eyes--that Arthur felt the warm blood rise to his face.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Greythorpe with <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> [...] "not <b>so</b> far as I'm {{acquainted with}} their views, {{but we would}} like the strip of unoccupied territory, and Sedgwick seems alive to its importance." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{now turned}} to look at the [...] "boy," [...] who was sitting on his pony with both eyes nearly shut, and <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>so</b> wide that the double row of his teeth were exposed to the very last grinders! ...|$|E
60|$|MURRAY. And I can't {{tell you}} how I've missed those letters {{for the past three}} weeks. They left a big hole in things. I was worried about you--not having heard a word. (With <b>a</b> <b>smile.)</b> <b>So</b> I came to look you up.|$|E
60|$|Miss Triscoe did not linger; she alleged the {{necessity}} of looking up her father, and went away with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>so</b> friendly that Mrs. March might easily have construed it to mean that no blame attached itself to her in Miss Triscoe's mind.|$|E
6000|$|Here Mr. Archer {{turned to}} Nance Holdaway with <b>a</b> {{pleasant}} <b>smile,</b> <b>so</b> full of sweetness, kindness, and composure that, at one bound, her dreams returned to her. ‘My good Miss Holdaway,’ said he, ‘if {{you are willing}} to show me the road, I am even eager to be gone. As for his lordship and myself, compose yourself; there is no fear; this is his lordship’s way.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I wish I were a man,' she cried, with <b>a</b> bright <b>smile.</b> 'It's <b>so</b> {{hard that}} I {{can do nothing}} but sit at home and spur others on. I {{want to do things}} myself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To be {{left alone}} when I have no mind to talk," [...] said Diogenes with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> which was <b>so</b> pleasant, so merry, so full of self-deprecating irony that it {{tempered}} the incivility of his reply.|$|R
6000|$|... 10 a mouth {{shaped like}} a new moon. The face, when completed, {{could not have been}} {{considered}} strictly beautiful; but it wore <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>so</b> big and broad, and was so Jolly in expression, that even Tip laughed as he looked admiringly at his work.|$|E
60|$|PAGE 71. l. 347. champaign, country. We {{can picture}} Isabel, as they 'creep' along, furtively glancing round, and then {{producing}} her knife with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>so</b> terrible {{that the old}} nurse can only fear that she is delirious, as her sudden vigour would also suggest.|$|E
60|$|Emma {{bowed to}} the young men, and said good-bye to her father with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>so</b> ineffably captivating, that Edwin {{resolved}} then and there to lay {{the foundation of a}} career which would end in a wife with nut-brown hair and large lustrous eyes.|$|E
6000|$|Here Mr. Archer {{turned to}} Nance Holdaway with <b>a</b> {{pleasant}} <b>smile,</b> <b>so</b> full of sweetness, kindness, and composure that, at one bound, her dreams returned to her. [...] "My good Miss Holdaway," [...] said he, [...] "if {{you are willing}} to show me the road, I am even eager to be gone. As for his lordship and myself, compose yourself; there is no fear; this is his lordship's way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very likely," [...] said Paul, {{turning away}} with <b>a</b> faint <b>smile.</b> <b>So</b> {{it was already}} in the air! Setting aside the old negro's {{characteristic}} exaggeration, there had already been some conversation between the colonel and the Mayor, which George had vaguely overheard. He might be too late, the alternative might be no longer in his hands. But his discomposure was heightened a moment later by the actual apparition of the returning Pendleton.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Van Hook {{was such}} a New York type--of a certain kind," [...] said Mrs. Pasmer. She rose, with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> at once <b>so</b> conventional, so heroic, and so pitiful that Mrs. Brinkley felt the remorse of a generous victor.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I had {{forgotten}} that your sex is often as timorous {{as it is}} fair," [...] he added, with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>so</b> insinuating and gentle, that the governess cast an involuntary and uneasy glance towards her charge, [...] "or I might have been earlier with my assurance of safety." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{a quarter}} of a minute Barbara looked at Nevada with a strange steadfastness; and then <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>so</b> small that it widened her mouth only the sixteenth part of an inch, and narrowed her eyes no more than a twentieth, flashed like an {{inspired}} thought across her face.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned her}} eyes on her {{mistress}} as she spoke, and immediately a transformation scene was presented. The eyes dwindled into slits as the cheeks rose, and the serious pout became <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>so</b> magnificent that ivory teeth and scarlet gums set in ebony alone met {{the gaze of the}} beholder.|$|E
60|$|And so I came face to {{face with}} another <b>smile,</b> behind <b>a</b> spying-glass,--a <b>smile</b> <b>so</b> cynical and {{unpleasant}} withal that my own was smothered. A tall and thin gentleman, who had come out of the inn without a hat, was surveying the dispute with a keen delight. He was past the middle age. His clothes bore that mark which distinguishes his world from the other, but his features were so striking as to hold my attention unwittingly.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's no good, old man," [...] he says, with <b>a</b> sickly <b>smile,</b> <b>so</b> full of pathos {{that it is}} {{impossible}} to find it in one's heart to feel anything but pity for him. [...] "I can't help it. I have given way to this sort of thing too long. It is too late to reform now. You go on and get a drink somewhere; I'll join you again in a few minutes. Don't worry about me; it's no good." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Tristram made no {{immediate}} rejoinder, {{but at last}} she said, with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> which, in <b>so</b> far {{as it was a}} forced one, was less successfully simulated than such smiles, on her lips, usually were; [...] "Are you very sure that you would have been happy?" ...|$|R
