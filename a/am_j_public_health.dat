40|$|Information {{related to}} {{infection}} of wild rodents or lagomorphs in Canada by Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, other Yersinia spp., and Clostridium piliforme was searched for this study. Reports on tularemia in humans linked to these species came from diagnostic databases, literature, wildlife <b>health</b> specialists, and <b>public</b> <b>health</b> agencies. Tularemia has been diagnosed in 8 species of wild rodent and 2 {{species in the}} genus Lepus in Canada. Tularemia occurred in wild animals, or in humans associated with these species, in all jurisdictions except the Yukon and Nunavut. Tularemia was diagnosed most frequently in beaver, muskrats, and snowshoe hares, and although tularemia is closely linked to cottontail rabbits in the USA, {{it has not been}} reported in cottontails in Canada. Tularemia in humans was associated with muskrats and hares more commonly than with beaver. Plague was diagnosed in bushy-tailed woodrats in British Columbia in 1988. Based on surveys, Y. pestis may occur enzootically in southern Alberta, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia. Infection with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica has been diagnosed in beaver, muskrats, and snowshoe hares in many provinces. Tyzzer's disease has been diagnosed in muskrats in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and Quebec and in snowshoe hares in Ontario. Infection with these bacteria is likely much more frequent than indicated by diagnostic records. Accession Number: 20190973. Language: English. Language Code: eng. Date Revised: 20100930.

Background: As the {{proportion}} of dentate older people increases, the need and demand for dental services will rise (<b>J</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> Dent, 60, 2000, 276). Design: Focus groups and semi-structured interviews were used for data collection. Setting and subjects: The study participants included 63 older people in Perth, WA.

40|$|The recent review, 'New {{evidence}} on fluoridation', by Diesendorf, Colquhoun, Spittle, Everingham and Clutterbuck (Aust N Z <b>J</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> 1997; 21 : 187 - 90) claims a consistent pattern of evidence pointing to fluoride damaging bone, a negligible benefit in dental caries reduction from ingested fluoride, and any small benefit from fluoride {{coming from the}} action of fluoride at the tooth surface. <b>Public</b> <b>health</b> authorities are allegedly reluctant to pursue such evidence. In the interest of scholarly debate, invited by Diesendorf et al., this reaction paper examines six separate areas raised in the original paper: fluoridation and hip fracture; fluoridation and osteosarcomas; pre-eruptive and posteruptive benefits in dental caries reduction; fluoride ingestion; benefit in dental caries reduction for contemporary Australian children; and bias of health authorities and responsible science. Numerous examples of bias in the identification, selection and appraisal of the {{evidence on}} water fluoridation presented by Diesendorf et al. are developed.
