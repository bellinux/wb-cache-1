50|$|<b>Araroba</b> powder {{is a drug}} {{occurring}} {{in the form of}} a yellowish-brown powder, varying considerably in tint, which derives an alternative name, Goa powder, from the Portuguese colony of Goa, where it appears to have been introduced about the year 1852, and is also known as Bahia powder.|$|E
50|$|Dermatophytosis {{has been}} {{prevalent}} since before 1906, {{at which time}} ringworm was treated with compounds of mercury or sometimes sulfur or iodine. Hairy areas of skin were considered too difficult to treat, so the scalp was treated with X-rays and followed up with antifungal medication. Another treatment from {{around the same time}} was application of <b>Araroba</b> powder.|$|E
50|$|The tree which yields {{it is the}} Andira <b>Araroba</b> of {{the natural}} order Leguminosae. It is met with in great {{abundance}} in certain forests {{in the province of}} Bahia, preferring as a rule low and humid spots. The tree is from 80 to 100 ft. high and has large imparipinnate leaves, the leaflets of which are oblong, about 12 in. long and 1 in. broad, and somewhat truncate at the apex. The flowers are papilionaceous, of a purple color and arranged in panicles.|$|E
50|$|The Goa powder or <b>araroba</b> is {{contained}} in the trunk, filling crevices in the heartwood. It is a morbid product in the tree, and yields to hot chloroform 50% of a substance known officially as chrysarobin. It occurs as a micro-crystalline, odorless, tasteless powder, very slightly soluble in either water or alcohol; it also occurs in rhubarb root. This complex mixture contains pure chrysarobin, di-chrysarobin methylether, di-chrysarobin. Chrysarobin is a methyl trioxyanthracene and exists as a glucoside in the plant, but is gradually oxidized to chrysophanic acid (a dioxy-methyl anthraquinone) and glucose. This strikes a blood-red color in alkaline solutions, and may therefore cause much alarm if administered to a patient whose urine is alkaline. The British pharmacopoeia has an ointment containing one part of chrysarobin and 24 of benzoated lard.|$|E
