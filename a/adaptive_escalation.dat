40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} from {{a planning}} {{point of view}} the dose distribution of adaptive radiation dose escalation in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) using 18 F-Fluoroazomycin arabinoside (FAZA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET-CT). Material/methods. Twelve patients with locally advanced HNSCC underwent three FAZA PET-CT before treatment, after 7 fractions and after 17 fractions of a carboplatin- 5 FU chemo-radiotherapy regimen (70 Gy in 2 Gy per fraction over 7 weeks). The dose constraints were that every hypoxic voxel delineated before and during treatment (newborn hypoxic voxels) should receive a total dose of 86 Gy. A median dose of 2. 47 Gy per fraction was prescribed on the hypoxic PTV defined on the pre-treatment FAZA PET-CT; a median dose of 2. 57 Gy per fraction was prescribed on the newborn voxels identified on the first per-treatment FAZA PET-CT; a median dose of 2. 89 Gy per fraction was prescribed on the newborn voxels identified on the second per-treatment FAZA PET-CT. results. Ten of 12 patients had hypoxic volumes. Six of 10 patients completed all the FAZA PET-CT during radio- therapy. For the hypoxic PTVs, the average D 50 % matched the prescribed dose within 2 % and the homogeneity indices reached 0. 10 and 0. 12 for the nodal PTV 86 Gy and the primary PTV 86 Gy, respectively. Compared to a homogeneous 70 Gy mean dose to the PTVs, the dose escalation up to 86 Gy to the hypoxic volumes did not typically modify the dose metrics on the surrounding normal tissues. conclusion. From a planning point of view, FAZA-PET-guided dose <b>adaptive</b> <b>escalation</b> is feasible without substantial dose increase to normal tissues above tolerance limits. Clinical prospective studies, however, need to be performed to validate hypoxia-guided adaptive radiation dose escalation in head and neck carcinoma...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A self-aware signal {{processing}} architecture is proposed based on <b>adaptive</b> resource <b>escalation</b> which {{is guided by}} a multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (GA). TheGAprioritizes taskswithin a reconfigurable hardware fabric to maintain the quality-of-service and power consumption objectives. Attainment of these objectives {{is subject to the}} intrinsic reliability and performance of the computational elements in the resource pool. A health metric at the application layer, such as Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) measurement in a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) or Measure of Confidence in a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, is used to assess throughput performance. When performance decreases beyond acceptable tolerances, the primary objective is to maximally recover output quality. The secondary objective is to minimize power consumption which also depends upon the input signal characteristics, in addition to the utilized computational resources. An adaptive guidance function for GA-driven recovery is proposed and validated for these objectives. It retains healthy processing elements in the throughput datapath to gracefully-degrad...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} design approaches of <b>adaptive</b> dose <b>escalation</b> {{study and the}} analysis methods of dose study data, {{and the relationship between}} the study design approach and data analysis methods. A general max-min approach to construct simultaneous confidence Intervals for the monotone means of correlated and normally istributed random samples is proposed to analyze correlated dose response data. The approach provides an accurate, flexible and computationally easy way to obtain critical values of simultaneous confidence intervals under monotone order restriction. Stepdown testing procedure for analyzing dose study data is examined and an modified stepdown testing approach is proposed to incorporate the adaptive sampling nature of the study data. An approximate mixture normal distribution of the dose response is proposed to analyze the binary outcome with small sample size at the first stage of the adaptive design. Finally, an optimal stage-wise adptive clinical dose study design is proposed to be applied in dose escalation study with binary outcome and correlated dose response. The study design criteria is defined as a weighted average power to identify all effective dose levels. A back induction algorithm is used to obtain the design parameters. The values of optimal design parameters vary when different analysis methods are used to analyze the study data. Simulation studies are performed to illustrate the two proposed analysis methods and the proposed optimal design approach...|$|R
40|$|Introduction:Anaplastic {{lymphoma}} kinase (ALK) -rearranged nonâ€“small-cell {{lung cancer}} (NSCLC) {{is sensitive to}} ALK inhibitors, but resistance develops. This study assessed the maximum-tolerated dose, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and antitumor activity of ceritinib, a novel ALK inhibitor (ALKi), in Japanese patients with ALK-rearranged malignancies. Methods:This phase I, multicenter, open-label study (NCT 01634763) enrolled adult patients with ALK-rearranged (by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} and/or immunohistochemistry) locally advanced/metastatic malignancy that had progressed despite standard therapy. The study comprised two parts: dose escalation and dose expansion. Ceritinib (single-dose) was administered orally in the 3 -day PK run-in period, then once daily, in 21 -day cycles. <b>Adaptive</b> dose <b>escalations</b> were guided by a Bayesian model. Results:Twenty patients (80 % with ALKi treatment history [ALKi-pretreated]; 19 NSCLC; one inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor) received ceritinib 300 to 750 [*]mg (19 during dose escalation, one in dose expansion). Two dose-limiting toxicities occurred: grade 3 lipase increase (600 [*]mg); grade 3 drug-induced liver injury (750 [*]mg). The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal (nausea: 95 %; diarrhea, vomiting: 75 %). Ceritinib PK profile was dose proportional across 300 to 750 [*]mg dosages; steady state was reached by day 15. Overall response rate was 55 % (11 of 20 patients). Among patients with NSCLC, partial response was observed in two of four ALKi-naive patients, five of nine crizotinib-pretreated patients, two of four alectinib-pretreated patients, and one of two crizotinib and alectinib/ASP 3026 pretreated patients. The ASP 3026 -pretreated inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor patient achieved partial response. Conclusions:Ceritinib maximum-tolerated dose was 750 [*]mg once daily in Japanese patients. Antitumor activity was observed irrespective of prior ALKi treatment history. Dose expansion, examining the activity of ceritinib in alectinib-resistant patients, is ongoing...|$|R
40|$|Ecological stoichiometry, {{the study}} of the balance of energy and {{materials}} in living systems, may serve as a useful synthetic framework for evolutionary biology. Here, we review recent work that illustrates the power of a stoichiometric approach to evolution across multiple scales, and then point to important open questions that may chart the way forward in this new field. At the molecular level, stoichiometry links hereditary changes in the molecular composition of organisms to key phenotypic functions. At the level of evolutionary ecology, a simultaneous focus on the energetic and material underpinnings of evolutionary tradeoffs and transactions highlights the relationship between the cost of resource acquisition and the functional consequences of biochemical composition. At the macroevolutionary level, a stoichiometric perspective can better operationalize models of <b>adaptive</b> radiation and <b>escalation,</b> and elucidate links between evolutionary innovation and the development of global biogeochemical cycles. Because ecological stoichiometry focuses on the interaction of energetic and multiple material currencies, it should provide new opportunities for coupling evolutionary dynamics across scales from genomes to the biosphere...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this phase II and pharmacologic {{study was to explore}} the feasibility toxicity and activity of <b>adaptive</b> intrapatient dose <b>escalation</b> of cisplatin in a dose-intensive weekly schedule using predefined levels of exposure, with the ultimate aim to improve the antitumour activity of the therapy in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Platinum DNA-adduct levels in peripheral white blood cells during treatment were used as the primary parameter for adaptive dosing. If DNA-adduct levels were not available, the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of unbound platinum in plasma was used for dose adaptation. Target levels for DNA-adducts and AUC have been defined in a previously performed pharmacologic study. The feasibility of adaptive dosing was tested in 76 patients with stage IIIB and IV NSCLC, who were planned to receive 6 weekly courses of cisplatin at a starting dose of 70 mg m- 2, together with daily low oral dose of 50 mg VP 16. In total, 37 patients (49 %) who were given more than one course received a dose increase varying from 10 to 55 %. The majority of patients reached the defined target levels by a dose increase during course two. Relevant grade 2 neurotoxicity was observed in eight (10 %) patients and reversible ototoxicity grade 2 in 14 (18 %) patients. The strategy of adaptive intrapatient dose adjustment of cisplatin is practically feasible in a research setting even when results for dose adaptation have to be reported within a short time-period of I week. The toxicity appeared to be manageable in this cohort of patients. In some patients, exposure after the standard dose was substantially lower than the defined target level and significant dose escalations of more than 50 % had to be applied. The response rate (RR) was relatively high: overall 40 % (29 out of 72 patients) partial remission (PR), in patients with stage IIIB the RR was 60 % (15 out of 25 patients) and with stage IV 30 % (14 out of 47 patients). Randomised studies are needed to determine whether the adaptive dosing strategy results in better efficacy than standard dosing...|$|R
