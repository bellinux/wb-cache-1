50|$|Maxwell's analogy was {{initially}} used merely to help explain electrical phenomena in more familiar mechanical terms. The work of Firestone, Trent and others moved the field well beyond this, looking to represent systems of multiple energy domains {{as a single}} system. In particular, designers started converting the mechanical parts of an electromechanical system to the electrical domain so that the whole system could be analyzed as an electrical circuit.

5000|$|On January 18, 2017 {{a former}} fundraiser for SNAP, Gretchen Rachel Hammond, filed a whistle blower {{lawsuit against the}} {{organization}} in Cook County, IL. Hammond had been employed by SNAP as a Director of Development from July, 2011 through February 2013. In the lawsuit, Hammond alleged that SNAP fired her in retaliation for confronting the organization for “colluding with survivors’ attorneys.” The lawsuit stated that “SNAP does not focus on protecting or helping survivors — it exploits them. SNAP routinely accepts financial kickbacks from attorneys {{in the form of}} ‘donations.’ In exchange for the kickbacks, SNAP refers survivors as potential clients to attorneys, who then file lawsuits on behalf of the survivors against the Catholic Church.” According to the Catholic News Agency, the lawsuit claimed that SNAP [...] "receives 'substantial contributions' from attorneys sometimes totaling more than 40 or 50 percent of its annual contributions. A prominent Minnesota attorney who represents clergy abuse survivors reportedly donated several six-figure annual sums, including over $415,000 in 2008. Other unnamed attorney-donors who represent abuse survivors reportedly came from California, Chicago, Seattle, and Delaware." [...] The lawsuit also cited emails sent by David Clohessy and Barbara Blaine to survivors and [...] "prominent attorneys". In one such email, Clohessy urges a survivor to sue the Wisconsin archdiocese [...] "i sure hope you DO pursue the WI Wisconsin bankruptcy … Every nickle (sic) they don't have is <b>a</b> <b>nickle</b> (sic) that they can't spend on defense lawyers, PR staff,gay-bashing, women-hating, contraceptive-battling, etc." [...] SNAP denied the allegations. Outreach Director Barbara Dorris told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, “That’s simply just not true,” outreach director Barbara Dorris said about misrepresenting the best interest of abuse victims. “We have been and always will be a self-help support group for victims.” Dorris added that she couldn't remember if Hammond, who identifies as a transgender woman and is currently a journalist for the LGBT paper Windy City Times in Chicago, had been fired or not. SNAP president Barbara Blaine issued a statement which read “The allegations are not true. This will be proven in court. SNAP leaders are now, and always have been, devoted to following the SNAP mission: To help victims heal and to prevent further sexual abuse." [...] On January 24, 2017, The Chicago Sun Times reported that Clohessy “voluntarily resigned” from SNAP “effective Dec. 31,” according to a two-paragraph email from SNAP Board Chairwoman Mary Ellen Kruger. Clohessy told the Kansas City Star [...] "that the lawsuit {{had nothing to do with}} his resignation and called the allegations in the case 'preposterous.'” A statement from Catholic League president Bill Donohue called SNAP's announcement of Clohessy's retirement [...] "an incomplete, if not dishonest, account. Had it not been for a string of lawsuits and bad publicity, he would have stayed for years. He will now be remembered for running when the going got tough, leaving behind a shell of an organization that is broken both morally and financially." [...] When SNAP president Blaine later resigned, effective February 3, 2017, she wrote in an emailed statement, [...] "'Please know that the recent lawsuit filed against SNAP, as the others in the past which have no merit, had absolutely no bearing on my leaving'", according to the Chicago Tribune.|$|E

40|$|Sequencing the {{complete}} genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H 37 Rv {{is a major}} milestone in the genome project and it sheds new light in our fight with tuberculosis. The genome contains around 4000 genes (protein-coding sequences) in the original genome annotation. A subsequent reannotation of the genome has added 80 more genes. However, {{we have found that}} the intergenic regions can exhibit expression signals, as evidenced by microarray hybridization. It is then reasonable to suspect that there are unidentified genes in these regions. We conducted a genome-wide analysis using the Affymetrix GeneChip to explore genes contained in the intergenic sequences of the M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv genome. A working criterion for potential protein-coding genes was based on bioinformatics, consisting of the gene structure, protein coding potential, and presence of ortholog evidence. The bioinformatics criteria in conjunction with transcriptional evidence revealed potential genes with a specific function, such as a DNA-binding protein in the CopG family and <b>a</b> <b>nickle</b> binding GTPase, as well as hypothetical proteins that had not been reported in the H 37 Rv genome. This study further demonstrated that microarray-based transcriptional evidence would facilitate genome-wide gene finding, and is also the first report concerning intergenic expression in M. tuberculosis genome. </p...|$|E

The Crimson Tide took an early 20-0 lead after they scored three touchdowns {{in the final four}} minutes of the first quarter. Bobby Jackson scored first on a two-yard run, the second was scored on a 16-yard Jackson pass to Laurien Stapp and the third on a 56-yard Gary O'Steen punt return. A 24-yard Pete Reaves field goal in the second quarter {{extended}} the Alabama lead to 23-0 at halftime. In the third quarter, Furman scored their only points of the game on <b>a</b> nine-yard Roy <b>Nickles</b> touchdown run. The Crimson Tide responded with a 61-yard Bobby Smith touchdown pass to O'Steen that made the final score 29-6. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against Furman to 4-0.|$|R
40|$|Code {{injection}} attacks, {{despite being}} well researched, {{continue to be}} a problem today. Modern architectural solutions such as the execute-disable bit have been useful in limiting the attacks, however they enforce program layout restrictions and can often still be circumvented by a determined attacker. In this dissertation, we analyze the code injection problem {{from the perspective of a}} vulnerable system’s memory architecture. We propose an alternative memory architecture, the split memory architecture (SMA), which is not susceptible to code injection attacks. This memory architecture can be implemented either in software running on a von Neumann memory architecture or through slight modifications to the von Neumann architecture. The SMA is also able to support the execution of unmodified programs and operating systems designed and compiled for a von Neumann system. ^ We demonstrate the efficacy of the SMA approach at the user-level by presenting the design, implementation, and evaluation of an operating system level patch to run a process inside an SMA. The results show that the system is able to prevent a variety of code injection attacks while imposing less than 20 % overhead on average. ^ We also demonstrate an SMA at the kernel-level with <b>NICKLE,</b> <b>an</b> instantiation of an SMA in a virtual machine monitor (VMM). We use NICKLE to verify the applicability of the SMA design to the prevention of code injection based kernel rootkits. Our evaluation reveals that NICKLE is able to prevent the execution of these rootkits while imposing less than 10 % overhead to QEMU. The VMM-based SMA is also used as the basis for a rootkit profiler named PoKeR, which is able to help human experts determine the behavior of a rootkit. ^ Our results reveal that the SMA can be a solution for preventing code injection attacks in both user-level applications and the operating system kernel. ...|$|R
