40|$|Guillain-Barré {{syndrome}} (GBS) is an <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>polyradiculoneuropathy</b> {{that can}} cause total motor paralysis in severe cases.

Although it has been observed in a few reported cases, theoretically, hypercalcaemia is not described as a plasmapheresis-related problem unless there is an underlying cause. We present a rare case of an 8 -year-old child presenting with headache, diplopia, and squint, followed by disturbed conscious levels and paralysis. He was treated with both intravenous immunoglobulin and plasmapheresis, with a favourable outcome. We made a laboratory observation of hypercalcaemia which was associated with the plasmapheresis therapy without any related underlying cause.

We report a 42 -year-old HIV-positive patient with an <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>polyradiculoneuropathy</b> associated with subclinical HCV infection. He presented with rapidly progressing sensorimotor symptoms 2 weeks after an episode of fever and asthenia. EMG/ENG study indicated a demyelinating damage of motor and sensory nerves. CSF findings revealed 20 WBC/mmc, IgG intrathecal synthesis and oligoclonal bands, but no increase in proteins. He underwent plasmapheresis, and the clinical course improved within 1 month. Quantitative analysis of the HIV- 1 and HCV viral load in paired plasma/CSF samples showed detectable amounts of HCV-RNA in CSF on clinical presentation and a subsequent decrease below quantification limits after plasmapheresis. Conversely, plasma HIV- 1 viral load was persistently high after plasmapheresis, too, while {{there was an increase}} in HIV- 1 RNA in CSF immediately after plasmapheresis, even if symptoms were improving. Moreover, the lack of HIV- 1 specific cytolytic activity in CSF-derived CD 8 + cells suggests that a cellular immune response against HIV- 1 antigens was an unlikely cause of the disease. HCV infection has been associated with acute GBS only in a handful of patients, and no direct demonstration of viral genome in CSF is available, though recent works suggest that HCV may enter the CSF.

40|$|Objectives: This study aims to {{retrospectively}} evaluate pediatric Guillain-Barré syndrome {{cases in}} a tertiary center in Istanbul, Turkey. Materials and Methods: The data of 40 patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome {{who had been}} admitted to the Department of Pediatrics at the Istanbul University Medical Faculty between 2005 and 2011 were collected. Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, chi-square, and Fisher′s exact tests were used for statistical analysis. Results: Mean patient age was 5. 4 ± 3. 0 years; 20 out of 40 patients (50 %) were female and 20 (50 %) were male. Preceding infection was detected in 32 cases (80 %). Six patients had speech impairment. Out of eight patients with respiratory distress (20 %), five required respiratory support (12. 5 %) of which {{three of them had}} speech impairment as well.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the prognostic value of the pretreatment and post-treatment albumin level, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in subtypes of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). A retrospective analysis of 62 patients with GBS treated between 2011 and 2015 in Dicle University Hospital, Turkey, was carried out. The pretreatment and post-treatment albumin, NLR, and PLR were documented, together with <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyradiculoneuropathy</b> (AIDP), <b>acute</b> motor axonal neuropathy, motor sensory axonal neuropathy, and Hughes&# 8217; scores. Post-treatment albumin levels in GBS were significantly reduced, and albumin level was negatively correlated with the Hughes scores. Elevated pretreatment NLRs and PLRs were significantly associated with AIDP. There were no correlations between the Hughes scores, NLR, and PLR. The results point to a negative correlation between albumin levels and GBS disability and suggest that the NLR and PLR may be promising blood biomarkers of AIDP...|$|R
40|$|Background: Quadriparesis {{is a major}} {{disabling}} health problem. Its {{importance is}} due to the incapacitating disability that often persists despite treatment. It encompasses a large range of disease entities ranging from degenerative, demyelination, infection, familial, autoimmune, cerebrovascular accident and space occupying lesion in the brain. Aim of the study: Is to study the etiologies and clinical presentation of quadriparesis in sudanese patients. Material and methods: This is a descriptive cross -sectional study of 100 patients admitted in Al Shaab Teaching Hospital from Jan. 2002 -Oct. 2003, presented with four limbs weakness. Results: There were 55 male and 45 female, {{more than half of the}} patients (55 %) were in the age group of 18 - 44. Patients were originally from different states and different racial groups. 75 % of the patients presented with gradual onset. Weakness was the presenting complaint in all patients. 39 % of the patients were wheel chair bounded.

40|$|We {{reviewed}} 180 electroneuromyographic (EMG) {{studies from}} patients with <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyradiculoneuropathy.</b> EMG criteria suggestive of demyelination were met {{during the first}} 5 weeks in 87 % of patients; an additional 10 % had indeterminate electrodiagnostic evaluations, and 3 % demonstrated axonal degeneration only. Motor nerve conduction abnormalities initially predominated, with the nadir of abnormality occurring at week 3. Sensory nerve conduction abnormalities peaked during week 4 and were atypical for polyneuropathy, with 52 % of patients having normal sural but abnormal median sensory studies, perhaps reflecting distal nerve involvement. Delayed sensory abnormalities may reflect, in part, secondary involvement related to increased intraneural edema accentuated by compression at sites of anatomic vulnerability. Fibrillation potentials and increased polyphasia appeared between weeks 2 and 5 in proximal and distal muscles simultaneously, {{which is consistent with}} either random axonal degeneration at any point along the axon or distal involvement. Resolution of conduction abnormalities began between weeks 6 and 10, with increased mean motor-evoked amplitude best reflecting functional clinical recovery...|$|R

40|$|Guillain-Barre {{syndrome}} (GBS) is an <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> neuropathy that {{is frequently}} triggered by an infectious illness.

Chronic <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyradiculoneuropathy</b> is a chronic inflammatory neuropathy, which shares some pathological features with GBS. We investigated the clinical features of GBS in an Australian cohort of subjects by performing a retrospective chart review.

The illness severity in our cohort was similar to that in earlier Australian studies. Also, we identified a cohort of 78 subjects fulfilling diagnostic criteria for CIDP from similar sources. We investigated a possible underlying genetic susceptibility to develop GBS or CIDP by contacting members of this cohort and collecting their DNA. We embarked on both a candidate gene approach to investigate the killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and their HLA ligands, as well as performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the subjects with GBS as a hypothesis-free method.

40|$|In vivo adoptive {{transfer}} of CD 4 + T helper cell type 1 clones reactive with autologous myelin basic protein (MBP) may initiate an inflammatory demyelinating {{disease of the}} central nervous system called experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Although MBP is also a component of peripheral nervous system (PNS) myelin, previous studies have failed to demonstrate inflammation in the PNS induced by MBP-reactive T cells. Here, we report on two MBP-specific T cell clones that preferentially initiate inflammatory and demyelinating peripheral neuritis when adoptively transferred to syngeneic recipients. The MBP epitope recognized by these clones spans the junction of exons 6 and 7 and, therefore, is present in the 21 - and 18. 5 -kD but not the 14 - and 17 -kD MBP isoforms, in which exon 5 is spliced to exon 7. The data suggest that MBP may be processed and presented differently in {{the central nervous system}} and PNS, and they provide evidence for MBP as a potential target for autoimmune reactions in the PNS.

40|$|Inflammatory cell {{recruitment}} is {{an important}} step in the pathogenesis of autoimmune demyelinating diseases of the PNS. Chemokines might {{play a critical role in}} promoting leucocyte entry into the nervous system during immune-mediated inflammation. Here, we report the expression pattern of the chemokine receptors CCR- 1, CCR- 2, CCR- 4, CCR- 5 and CXCR- 3 in sural nerve biopsies obtained from patients with classical Guillain–Barré syndrome (<b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyradiculoneuropathy),</b> chronic <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyradiculoneuropathy</b> and various non-inflammatory neuropathies. A consistent chemokine receptor expression pattern was immunohistochemically detected in inflammatory demyelinating neuropathies and quantitation of labelled mononuclear cells revealed significantly elevated cell counts compared with controls. CCR- 1 and CCR- 5 were primarily expressed by endoneurial macrophages, whereas CCR- 2, CCR- 4 and CXCR- 3 could be localized to invading T lymphocytes. Quantitative analysis revealed that CXCR- 3 was expressed at highest numbers by infiltrating T cells compared with the other receptors. Thus, expression and distribution of CXCR- 3 suggest a specific role of this receptor in chemokine-mediated lymphocyte traffic into the inflamed PNS tissue. Therefore, we further analysed the expression of its ligands interferon [...] inducible protein of 10 kDa (IP- 10) and monokine induced by interferon- (Mig). Significantly increased levels of IP- 10 could be measured in the CSF of patients with inflammatory neuropathies, whereas no differences were observable for Mig. In situ hybridization for IP- 10 mRNA mirrored the distribution of the cognate receptor within the inflamed PNS, and delineated endothelial cells as the primary cellular source of IP- 10. Our results imply a pathogenic role for specific chemokine receptors and IP- 10 in the genesis of inflammatory demyelinating neuropathies. </p...|$|R

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively assessed the clinical manifestations, results of electrodiagnostic tests, functional status and prognosis of 36 children diagnosed with GBS. Results: Based on clinical and electrophysiological findings, {{the patients were}} classified as having <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyradiculoneuropathy</b> (AIDP) (n = 25), acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) (n = 10) and acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN) (n = 1).

Five (13. 8 &#x 0025;) patients were younger than 2 years. The most common initial symptoms were limb weakness, which was documented in 34 (94. 4 &#x 0025;) patients. In our study, 18 patients (51. 4 &#x 0025;) showed albuminocytological dissociation (raised protein concentration without pleocytosis) on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination. Three patients (8. 3 &#x 0025;) required mechanical ventilation therapy during hospitalization.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{identify}} clinical {{characteristics of}} {{various forms of}} Guillain-Barré syndrome in Taiwan.  METHODS—The clinical and electrophysiological data of 167 consecutive patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome admitted to Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, a general paediatric and adult hospital in Taiwan, were reviewed.  RESULTS—Analysis of age distribution disclosed a high incidence (21 %) among patients {{under the age of}} 10 years. Seasonal preponderance in Spring (March to May) was found. Utilising clinical and electrophysiological data, these 167 patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome were subclassified; 82 (49 %) had <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyradiculoneuropathy</b> (AIDP), 32 (19 %) had Fisher syndrome (FS), and six (4 %) had axonal forms of Guillain-Barré syndrome. The remaining 47 (28 %) patients were unclassified. Patients with AIDP and FS had many common clinical features, including seasonal distribution, history of preceding illness, sensory abnormalities, cranial nerve involvement except for extraocular motor nerves, and albuminocytological dissociation on examination of CSF. Follow up study on 145 patients disclosed that 127 (87 %) recovered satisfactorily, 14 (10 %) were persistently disabled, and four (3 %) died during admission to hospital. Clinical features associated with poor outcome (persistent disability or death) were requirement for mechanical ventilation, a low mean compound muscle action potential amplitude (⩽ 10 % of the lower limit of normal), and age greater than 40 years.  CONCLUSION—Guillain-Barré syndrome in Taiwan showed a peculiar age and seasonal distribution and a high frequency of FS not seen in other series. Given that patients with AIDP and FS had many common clinical features, AIDP and FS may have similar underlying pathological mechanisms. ...|$|R

40|$|Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is an {{interfacing}} {{device that}} interacts with external device or computer. The principle of Brain Computer interface {{is based on}} Electroencephalography. Under the influence of external stimuli, human brain generates some responses on distinctive areas of the brain. These responses appear in the EEG signals captured from corresponding electrode positions on the scalp of the human subject. The responses appear in the EEG signal as a feature in the time domain, or a feature in the frequency domain depending upon the periodic nature of the stimuli. These features are then detected classified and then control signal is generated by an external device. This enables the subject to directly control an external device from the brain using the signals generated in response to stimulation.

40|$|The {{molecular}} determinants and signaling pathways {{responsible for}} hematogenous leukocyte trafficking during peripheral neuroinflammation are incompletely elucidated. Chemokine ligand/receptor pair CCL 2 /CCR 2 has been pathogenically {{implicated in the}} <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyradiculoneuropathy</b> variant of Guillain-Barre ́ syndrome (GBS). We evaluated the role of CCR 2 in peripheral neuroinflammation utilizing a severe murine experimental autoimmune neuritis (sm-EAN) model. Sm-EAN was induced in 8 – 12 week old female SJL CCR 2 knockout (CCR 2 KO), heterozygote (CCR 2 HT) and wild type (CCR 2 WT) mice, and daily neuromuscular severity scores and weights recorded. In vitro and in vivo splenocyte proliferation and cytokine expression assays, and sciatic nerve Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, TLR 4 and CCL 2 expression assays were performed to evaluate systemic and local innate immune activation at disease onset. Motor nerve electrophysiology and sciatic nerve histology were also performed to characterize the inflammatory neuropathy at expected peak severity. To further determine the functional relevance of CCR 2 in sm-EAN, 20 mg/kg CCR 2 antagonist, RS 102895 was administered daily for 5 days to a cohort of CCR 2 WT mice following sm-EAN disease onset, with efficacy compared to 400 mg/kg human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). CCR 2 KO mice were relatively resistant to sm-EAN compared to CCR 2 WT and CCR 2 HT mice, associated with attenuated peripheral nerve demyelinating neuritis. Partial CCR 2 gene deletion did not confer any protection against sm-EAN. CCR 2 KO mice demonstrated similar splenocyte activation or proliferation profiles, as well a...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Guillain-Barré {{syndrome}} (GBS) is {{an acute}} autoimmune disorder of peripheral nerves and their roots. The most common GBS variants are: <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyradiculoneuropathy</b> (AIDP), <b>acute</b> motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN), Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS) and other rarer variants. Aim: Evaluation of frequency of GBS variants {{and analysis of}} the outcome of the disease in a cohort of patients hospitalized at the Neurology Clinic, Clinical Center of Serbia. Material and Methods: This study included 43 patients with GBS, hospitalized in 2015. The data about clinical characteristics of the disease were collected by a retrospective analysis from electronic medical record. We used methods of descriptive statistics: mean, standard deviation and proportions. Results: Majority of our patients were male with male to female ratio 2. 6 : 1. The most common variant in our study was AIDP (41. 9 %), then AMSAN (7. 0 %) and AMAN (4. 7 %). The most common first symptoms of the disease were weakness and numbness in the legs (18. 6 %). According to the Hughes scale, at admission, most of the patients had a mild form of the disease (65. 1 %), while at nadir 62. 8 % were non ambulatory, and 2. 3 % of patients required assisted ventilation. The outcome of the disease was favorable in 74. 4 % of patients, while 11 patients (25. 6 %) had a significant functional disability on discharge. In (4. 7 %) 2 patients of our cohort, lethal outcome was recorded. Conclusion: GBS is a rapidly progressive, monophasic disease, which has a generally good prognosis today, thanks to modern therapy. Our further research will be focused on the long-term outcome of GBS...|$|R
40|$|Background: Chronic <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyradiculoneuropathy</b> {{is a rare}} {{acquired}} immune-mediated progressive or relapsing disorder causing peripheral neuropathic {{disease of}} duration more than two months. Many individuals with chronic <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyradiculoneuropathy</b> fail to make a long-term recovery with current treatment regimes. The {{aim of this study}} was to prospectively review the literature to determine the effectiveness of therapies for chronic <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyradiculoneuropathy.</b> Methods: Articles published from January 1990 to December 2012 were searched for studies to treat adults with chronic <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyradiculoneuropathy.</b> Peer-reviewed full-text articles published in English were included. Results: Nine placebo-controlled double-blinded randomised trials were reviewed to treat subjects with chronic <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyradiculoneuropathy</b> exhibiting various degrees of effectiveness. The most effect treatments were; three randomised controlled trials using intravenous immunoglobulin, a study comparing pulsed dexamethasone and short term prednisolone and rituximab all showed promising results and were well tolerated. Conclusion: IVIg and corticosteroids remain first line treatments for CIDP. Therapies using monoclonal antibodies, such as Rituximab and Natalizumab offer the most promise for treatment of Chronic <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyradiculoneuropathy</b> however they also need further research, as does the use of stem cell therapy for treating Chronic <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyradiculoneuropathy.</b> Large randomised controlled trials and better patient selection are required to address responsiveness of CIDP patients to conventional treatments to elucidate mechanisms of action and future directions for therapeutic improvement.

40|$|A {{retrospective}} study of 42 cases of {{acute flaccid paralysis}} (AFP) in children aged between 7 months and 15 years, registered at the Municipal Clinical Hospital № 1 throughout a 7 year period (2007 — 2014), was performed to investigate the features of pediatric Guillian-Barre Syndrome (GBS). GBS has shown to be the most common cause of AFP in children, with prevalence of 74 % of all 31 cases. Clinical manifestations, functional status, laboratory and electrodiagnostic data were evaluated in group of 31 children in order to highlight particular features of childhood GBS in Russia. The highest frequency of GBS was observed in children aged between 1 to 3 with the median 6 [3; 11] years. Boys with GBS outnumbered girls by a 2, 1 : 1 ratio. No seasonal dependence has been observed, with children equally suffering from this disease without a seasonal pattern throughout the year. According to the electrophysiological and clinical data, 24 children were diagnosed with <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyradiculoneuropathy</b> (AIDP) (77 %), 5 with acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) (16 %) and 2 with аcute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN) {{in a total of}} cases (7 %). Several exclusive features of GBS in children for Russia were discovered. The most common initial symptom was limb pain, with the impartial sensory disturbance found only in 13 % of the patients observed, 10 % of which were paresthesias and the remaining  3 % belonging to hypostesias. Children reached the nadir state rapidly, the median time from onset to nadir was 9. 5 [6, 25; 12, 5] days. Cranial nerve dysfunction at nadir was observed in a greater percentage of patients (51 %) compared to that of 23 % cases at the onset, with the facial palsy increasing from 10 to 32 % and the bulbar palsy from 12 to 19 %. The patients were given intravenous immunoglobulin in various doses: from 0. 2 to 1. 75 mg/kg per course (0. 5 [0. 5; 0. 8] g/kg)  and/or plasmapheresis with a median volume of 93 [81; 100] ml/kg per course. The treatment has shown to be effective for the majority of patients, but three children was resistant to the intravenous immunoglobulin. An important feature of pediatric GBS is a nonthreatening prognosis at the point of discharge, with the length of hospitalization numbering in with a median of 28 [20, 5; 38] days. </p...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: A fluorogenic peptide probe-immobilized {{diagnostic}} kit {{was used to}} analyze MMP activity in the synovial fluids (SFs) from patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> conditions of the knee joint. Methods: The MMP {{diagnostic kit}} containing a polymer-conjugated MMP probe immobilized on a 96 -well plate was utilized for high-throughput screening of MMP activity in SFs from OA patients (n = 33) and patients with <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> conditions of the knee joint (n = 5). Results: Compared to SF from OA patients, SF from patients with <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> conditions of the knee joint presented stronger NIR fluorescent signals. In gelatin zymography, most samples from patients with <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> conditions of the knee joint also displayed 92 kDa (pro-form) MMP- 9 and faint 84 kDa (active form) MMP- 9, while SF from OA patients did not display detectable MMP- 9 activity. Conclusion: The presence of a strong fluorescence signal from the MMP diagnostic kit corresponded well with patients with <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> conditions of the knee joint. The results suggest that our MMP diagnostic kit {{can be useful in}} differentiation between early stages of OA and <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> conditions of the knee joint. </p...|$|R
