25|$|Similar {{approaches}} {{refer to}} the overall 'architecture' or 'meta-structure', particularly {{in relation to the}} development of the DSM or ICD systems. Five proposed meta-structure groupings were recently proposed in this way, based on views and evidence relating to risk factors and clinical presention. The clusters of disorder that emerged were described as neurocognitive (identified mainly by neural substrate abnormalities), neurodevelopmental (identified mainly by early and continuing cognitive deficits), psychosis (identified mainly by clinical features and biomarkers for information processing deficits), emotional (identified mainly by being preceded by a temperament of negative emotionality), <b>and</b> <b>externalizing</b> (identified mainly be being preceded by disinhibition). However, the analysis was not necessarily able to validate one arrangement over others. From a psychological point of view, it has been suggested that the underlying phenomena are too complex, inter-related and continuous– with too poorly understood a biological or environmental basis– to expect that everything can be mapped into a set of categories for all purposes. In this context the overall system of classification is to some extent arbitrary, and could be thought of as a user inferface which may need to satisfy different purposes.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between cohesion and {{flexibility in the}} foster family and the foster child's psychosocial functioning was examined. Psychosocial functioning was conceptualized as internalized <b>and</b> <b>externalized</b> problems, <b>and</b> social skills. The sample consisted of 90 foster children aged 3 to 12, whose foster parents volunteered {{to participate in a}} PMTO-programme. Psychosocial functioning was assessed using Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Teacher's Report Form (TRF), Caregiver- Teacher's Report Form (C-TRF), and teacher- and parent versions of Social Skills Rating System (SSRS). Cohesion and flexibility were measured with Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales (FACES III). On average the foster children scored above the norms for internalized <b>and</b> <b>externalized</b> problems. Better social skills were related to fewer total, internalized <b>and</b> <b>externalized</b> problems. There was no association between cohesion and flexibility in the foster family and the child's internalized <b>and</b> <b>externalized</b> problems, however a higher degree of cohesion was related to better social skills. The results indicate that foster family cohesion may be an important factor in the social functioning for the foster children...|$|R

50|$|Researches {{have often}} {{conducted}} studies {{to determine whether}} membership to a clique produces positive or negative development. In one 4-year study of 451 children from age nine to twelve, Miranda Witvliet along with Pol A. C. van Lier, Mara Brendgen, Hans M. Koot, and Frank Vitaro examined longitudinal associations between clique membership status and internalizing <b>and</b> <b>externalizing</b> problems during late childhood. In this quasi-experiment the researchers aimed to discover if clique membership status was linked to increases in children's psychopathology. Children from five different elementary schools in northwestern Quebec, Canada were the participants of this particular study. In the study, clique membership status was identified through social network analysis, and peer nominations {{were used to assess}} internalizing <b>and</b> <b>externalizing</b> problems. The study used the program Kliquefinder to identify clique membership status through social network analysis. Through use of behavioural descriptions on the Pupil Evaluation Inventory (PEI), peer nominations of externalizing and internalizing behaviors were obtained.|$|E

Childhood family violence (physical and psychological parental violence), current extrafamily violence (bullying and dating violence), and family structure were taken into account. A sample of 278 adolescents (mean age: 14. 2) were recruited in three public schools located in low to high socioeconomic areas.

40|$|The central {{purpose of}} the present thesis was to {{integrate}} the construct of autonomy support postulated by Cognitive Evaluation Theory and the literature on parental behavioral and psychological control. Its first specific objective was to demonstrate that autonomy support (AS), behavioral control (BC), and psychological control (PS) are distinct constructs. Its second specific objective was to ascertain unique associations between parental AS, BC, and PC, on one hand, and youth self-processes, internalizing symptoms, <b>and</b> <b>externalized</b> behaviors, on the other hand. Three studies were designed to achieve these goals. In Study 1 A (N= 342) and Study 1 B (N= 300), cross-sectional questionnaires were completed by undergraduate students and the dimensionality of parental behaviors was examined by means of confirmatory factor analyses. Results revealed that AS, BC, and PC are modelized in an optimal manner as distinct constructs. Study 2 (N= 138) consisted of a laboratory experiment designed to test the unique associations between AS, BC, and PC and youth self-processes, internalizing symptoms, <b>and</b> <b>externalized</b> behaviors. Study 3 (N= 239) was a prospective field study that also endeavoured to examine the unique contribution of AS, BC, and PC to children functioning. In this study, self-processes, internalizing symptoms, <b>and</b> <b>externalized</b> behaviors were assessed over an 8 -month competitive season. Globally, results from Study 2 and Study 3 revealed that AS predicted youth autonomous motivation, positive affect, satisfaction, and lower levels of internalizing symptoms. PC reached significant negative influences on youth functioning (i. e., controlled motivation, higher levels of impaired concentration, manifest anxiety <b>and</b> <b>externalized</b> behaviors). BC revealed positive associations with two beneficial outcome variables (i. e., autonomous motivation and lower levels of intended dropout), and a single negative consequence (i. e., manifest anxiety). Taken together, the findings of the three studies presented here provide support for the importance of distinguishing between AS, BC, and PC as basic functional dimensions that offer unique contribution {{to our understanding of the}} influence of socializing agents on youth development and functioning...|$|R

A different model of information is presented here, which treats information as a process of state change (i. e., the term is used as a verb), rather than as a variable.

The proposed model also distinguishes epistemological levels of abstraction at which information takes place.

40|$|The role {{of coping}} {{strategies}} (approach and avoidance) as a mediating factor between parental psychological violence and adolescent behavior problems, both internalized <b>and</b> <b>externalized,</b> {{as well as the}} protective role of social support were examined separately for boys and girls.

The use of avoidant coping strategies partially mediated the link between parental psychological violence and behavior problems among girls. The use of approach coping strategies partially mediated the link between parental psy-chological violence and behavior problems among boys. In all cases, coping enhanced this link. No protective role of social support was found.

50|$|Schwartz et al. (1998) {{investigated}} {{the role of}} victimization {{in the development of}} children’s behavior problems, focusing on both internalizing <b>and</b> <b>externalizing</b> problems. They hypothesized that higher levels of victimization would lead to increased level of behavioral problems. Child behavior was reported by teachers and parents, measured using the Child Behavior Checklist, and peer victimization was measured using peer nomination. Indeed, they found that peer victimization in middle childhood was associated with behavioral maladjustment on both a concurrent and prospective basis. Additionally, externalizing behaviors were more strongly associated with victimization than were internalizing behaviors.|$|E
50|$|Next {{to genetic}} exposures, {{a wide variety}} of {{environmental}} exposures are being studied as well, such as nutrition,, urbanicity, stressful life events, and bullying. In contrast to genetic studies, the investigation of environmental exposures of psychiatric problems face the question of reverse causality. E.g., experiencing social stress might cause depression, however, being depressed might also worsen relationships with others and thus cause social stress. Finding an association between the occurrence of an environmental exposure and a disorder could be the result of either or both situations.Multiple strategies exist in psychiatric epidemiology to assess the direction of causality. One possibility is measuring the exposure and outcome multiple times. Researchers can then analyze how much a change in psychiatric symptoms {{can be attributed to the}} exposure at a previous time point, but also whether changes in the exposure can be predicted by previous symptom levels (cross-lagged model). Such a model was e.g. applied to the study of internalizing <b>and</b> <b>externalizing</b> psychological problems and stressful life events. Both, psychiatric problems as well as life events, were measured multiple times during grade 7,8,9,10 and 12. The researchers observed that stressful life events precede both internalizing <b>and</b> <b>externalizing</b> psychological problems, but appear to be also the result of experiencing such symptoms. An alternative approach is the use of twin studies, because discordance between monozygotic twins suggests environmental effects.|$|E
