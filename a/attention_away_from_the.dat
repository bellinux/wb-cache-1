5|$|The cast was rounded out by W. Earl Brown, {{who played}} Gale Weather's {{cameraman}} Kenny; Joseph Whipp, who portrayed Sheriff Burke; Lawrence Hecht as Neil Prescott (Sidney's father); and C.W. Morgan as Hank Loomis (Billy's father). Liev Schreiber {{appeared in a}} minor role as Cotton Weary, the framed killer of Sidney's mother and Linda Blair made a brief cameo as a TV reporter outside the school. Henry Winkler appeared as Principal Himbry, an aggressive school principal. He remained uncredited so as to not draw <b>attention</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> young main cast.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Allenby's {{plan for}} 13 November {{was to turn}} the right flank of the Ottoman line on the coast despite {{aircraft}} and cavalry reconnaissances revealing a considerable Ottoman force further inland on the Egyptian Expeditionary Force's own right flank. He assigned the task of dealing with this immediate threat to the Australian Mounted Division, which was ordered to make as big a demonstration of their operations as possible. This would further focus Ottoman <b>attention</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> coastal sector where the Anzac and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions would advance northwards to attempt to turn the Ottoman right flank assisted by infantry attacks on the Ottoman right centre the following day.|$|E
5|$|Piłsudski {{arrived at}} the front near Lida on 15 April, {{bringing}} reinforcements from Warsaw. His plan called for exploitation of {{the gap in the}} Soviet lines between Vilnius and Lida by an advance towards Vilnius using the road and railway. Amidst diversionary attacks, designed to draw Russian <b>attention</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> main Polish thrust towards Vilnius, the main Polish attack began at dawn on 16 April. The forces moving on Vilnius included the cavalry group of Colonel Wladyslaw Belina-Prazmowski, composed of 800 men in nine cavalry squadrons and a battery of horse artillery; and infantry under General Edward Rydz-Śmigły, composed of 2,500 men in three battalions of the Polish 1st Legions Infantry Division and two batteries of heavy artillery.|$|E
25|$|In early January 1795, {{however, the}} Chickasaw, who had sent warriors {{to take part}} in the Army of the Northwest, began killing Muscogee warriors found in Middle Tennessee as allies of the United States and taking their scalps, so in March, the Muscogee began to turn their <b>attentions</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Cumberland to the Chickasaw, over the entreaties of the Cherokee and the Choctaw.|$|R

50|$|Following the Second World War, <b>attention</b> focused <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Northern Quarter as Manchester {{began to}} build itself a modern city centre in the ruins left by German bombers. As a {{commercial}} area, Oldham Street became quieter, particularly as nearby Market Street and the Arndale Centre grew in importance.|$|R
5|$|In 1996, the {{military}} rulers in Burma undertook renovation {{work on the}} Mahamuni Pagoda. During this period, the Mahamuni Buddha image was damaged in 1997 when a hole appeared {{in the belly of}} the Great Image. It was believed that thieves had drilled the hole in an attempt to steal jewels believed to be secreted within the image. It was reported that a military officer had requested to open the temple in the night, resulting in a meeting of all the senior monks from major monasteries in the area to discuss the matter. Whilst the meeting was in progress, attention was diverted to a purported rape incident committed by a Muslim man on a Buddhist girl. A major riot broke out but it turned out afterward that the Buddhist girl had not been raped at all. It was a coverup to divert <b>attention</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Buddha so it could be repaired. However, the mystery remains as to whether any jewellery did exist and was actually removed from the Great Image at all.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1917, the Australians {{were moved}} to Belgium {{as the focus of}} British {{operations}} shifted to the Ypres sector in an effort to draw German <b>attention</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> French. The first effort came around Messines, on the southern flank, where a series of tunnels were dug under the German lines. On 7 June, 19 mines were detonated and in the ensuing fighting, the British captured Messines Ridge. Assigned a support role, the 15th Battalion was held in reserve and did not take part in the attack. The following day, it was committed to hold the gains that had been made during the attack, relieving the New Zealanders around Gooseberry Farm. The 15th remained in the Ypres sector and subsequently took part in the fighting around Polygon Wood during the Third Battle of Ypres in September. In November 1917, the battalion was withdrawn from the line for a three-month rest, spending the winter around Templeux-la-Fosse and Hollebeke.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{returned to}} the area in mid-July, tasked with minor operations intended to keep German <b>attention</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sector north of Ypres, {{which was to be}} the focus of renewed fighting as Haig continued with his planned offensive. Russell had his brigades man the division's section in rotation; those not in the trenches spent their time training. During this period, the New Zealanders captured the village of La Basseville but subsequently lost it to a German counterattack. At the end of the month, 2nd Wellington Battalion, 1st Brigade, retook the village with Lance-Corporal Leslie Andrew playing {{a key role in the}} action; he was later awarded the VC for his efforts. Over the following few weeks the men of the division worked to consolidate their positions in waterlogged trenches, rain having set in. Casualties were still incurred during this period including Brigadier General Johnston, killed by a sniper on 7 August while inspecting his new command, the Rifle Brigade.|$|E
50|$|In {{her book}} The Suspicions of Mr Whicher or The Murder at Road Hill House (2008), however, author Kate Summerscale {{comes to the}} {{conclusion}} that if Her confession was indeed false and merely an act to shield another person, it was for the benefit of not her father but her brother, William Saville-Kent, with whom she shared a very close sibling relationship, which was further deepened by her father turning his paternal <b>attentions</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> children of his first marriage to the children he had with his second wife. William was indeed suspected during the investigations but was never charged. Summerscale suggests that if William was not the culprit solely responsible for Francis's death, he was at least an accomplice to Constance.|$|R
50|$|Soon, the {{international}} <b>attention</b> was led <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Prisoners' Document and focussed on {{the assault on}} Gaza, which lasted {{until the end of}} November.|$|R
60|$|She was angered {{beyond what}} the {{circumstance}} warranted, and while the minister preached an admirable and learned watch-night sermon she felt her <b>attention</b> drifting <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> discourse and the solemnity of the occasion, whilst her wrath against a most unworthy object was taking the place of more pious and charitable feelings.|$|R
5|$|After this, {{they were}} sent to Pernois for rest and re-organisation, and after being brought back up to about two-thirds strength, the 2nd Battalion's next {{involvement}} in the fighting came around Mouquet Farm when they were briefly put into the line on 18/19 August to provide reinforcement, before being quickly relieved a few days later. In early September, I Anzac Corps was transferred from the Somme region to Ypres, in Belgium, swapping with the Canadians for a rest. Taking up a position north of the Ypres–Commines canal, the battalions of the 1st Division {{were placed in the}} centre of the line between those of the 4th, on the right to the south, and the 2nd on the left, to the north. The sector was a relatively quiet one, although not without its dangers due to constant mortar attacks, sniping, and the need to maintain patrols in no man's land. Nevertheless, duties in this time were focused mainly upon maintaining a defensive presence in the line and rebuilding the defences. In addition, a number of small-scale raids were also undertaken in an effort to draw some <b>attention</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fighting that was occurring on the Somme.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Lone Pine (also {{known as}} the Battle of Kanlı Sırt) was fought between Australian and Ottoman Empire forces during the Gallipoli Campaign of the First World War, between 6 and 10 August 1915. The battle {{was part of a}} diversionary attack to draw Ottoman <b>attention</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> main assaults against Sari Bair, Chunuk Bair and Hill 971, which became {{known as the}} August Offensive. The Australians, {{initially}} at brigade strength, managed to capture the main Ottoman trench line from the battalion that was defending the position in the first few hours of the fighting; however, the fighting continued for the next three days as the Ottomans brought up reinforcements and launched numerous counterattacks in an attempt to recapture the ground they had lost. As the counterattacks intensified the Australians brought up two fresh battalions. Finally, on 9 August the Ottomans called off any further attempts and by 10 August offensive action ceased, leaving the Australians in control of the position. Nevertheless, despite the Australian victory, the wider August Offensive of which the attack had been a part failed and a situation of stalemate developed around Lone Pine which lasted {{until the end of the}} campaign in December 1915 when Allied troops were evacuated from the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack on}} Juno Beach by the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division {{was the most}} {{successful}} of the five beaches attacked on D-Day, 6June 1944. Having successfully landed in Normandy, Allied forces soon became embroiled in battles against German armour and were unable to significantly expand their beachhead; {{by the time the}} 2nd Division came ashore {{at the end of the}} first week of July, the entire front had congealed. Assigned to the II Canadian Corps, and subordinated to the British Second Army, the division assembled its brigades for combat while British and Canadian forces launched Operation Charnwood. It was a tactical success, but could not clear all Caen of its German defenders. Although originally a D-Day objective, Caen proved a difficult prize, holding out until 19July when it finally fell to British troops during Operation Goodwood. In the aftermath, General Bernard Montgomery, commander of the Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group, ordered elements of II Canadian Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Guy Simonds, to push forward towards Verrières Ridge, the dominant geographical feature between Caen and Falaise. By keeping up the pressure, Montgomery hoped to divert German <b>attention</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> American sector to the west.|$|E

2500|$|An {{intense and}} broadly {{supported}} campaign for amnesty for all imprisoned war criminals ensued (more aggressively in Germany than in Japan at first), as <b>attention</b> turned <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> top wartime leaders and towards {{the majority of}} [...] "ordinary" [...] war criminals (Class B/C in Japan), {{and the issue of}} criminal responsibility was reframed as a humanitarian problem.|$|R
25|$|When the badly beaten troops under Marmont and Mortier heard <b>the</b> {{approaching}} gunfire <b>from</b> Pacthod's fight, {{they believed}} that Napoleon was coming to save them. Though it was not true, this allowed the two marshals to rally their defeated troops. The Allies turned their <b>attentions</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> two marshals {{and focused on the}} destruction of Pacthod's command. This probably saved Marmont and Mortier from total disaster. At the end, 78 guns were blasting Pacthod's soldiers and the Allied cavalry finally broke all the French infantry squares. With his troops still in a single square, Amey tried to get away into the Saint-Gond Marshes, but only a small handful of men escaped being killed, wounded or taken prisoner. Pacthod, Amey and several brigadiers were captured and the czar released them on parole in recognition of their bravery.|$|R
25|$|The {{number of}} admissions leveled off at around 53,000, and the house's {{trustees}} {{decided that they}} must expand or be forced to shrink their operations. They commissioned Robert A. M.

25|$|The Labour {{candidate}} for North West Norfolk, Manish Sood, described Gordon Brown as Britain's worst ever Prime Minister. The comments, which he repeated {{to a variety}} of news outlets, took <b>attention</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> previous day's speech by Brown to Citizens UK, widely described as his best in the campaign.|$|E
25|$|However Churchill {{raised it}} again {{as late as}} January 1944. Instead of an actual invasion, the Allies {{implemented}} Operation Solo I, a deception plan designed to draw <b>attention</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> preparations for Operation Torch, the invasion of north Africa, by creating the impression that troops based in Scotland were preparing to invade Norway.|$|E
25|$|For Judge Dredd {{to break}} the law was almost unheard of, as one of the {{defining}} traits of his character is his inflexible devotion to enforcing the law. This crime was to have major repercussions in the next phase of the storyline, as <b>attention</b> moved <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> robots themselves and settled more on the conflict between Dredd and McGruder.|$|R
50|$|This {{definition}} {{would include}} vehicle automation systems {{that may be}} available in the near term—such as traffic-jam assist, or full-range automated cruise control—if such systems would be designed such that the human operator can reasonably divert <b>attention</b> (monitoring) <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> performance of the vehicle while the automation system is engaged. This definition would also include automated platooning (such as conceptualized by the SARTRE project).|$|R
25|$|In 2003, using {{parliamentary}} privilege, Democratic Unionist Party MP Iris Robinson {{claimed that}} Adams {{was involved in}} the IRA's 1978 La Mon restaurant bombing.

25|$|As Mayor of San Francisco, Brown {{was often}} portrayed mockingly but affectionately by {{political}} cartoonists and columnists as a vain emperor, presiding in a robe and crown over the inconsequential kingdom of San Francisco. He enjoyed the attention this {{brought to his}} personal life, disarming friends and critics with humor that directed <b>attention</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> policy agendas he was pursuing.|$|E
25|$|The Catholic Church {{teaches that}} Christ is {{actually}} {{present on the}} altar in the sacrifice of the Mass, when a priest consecrates bread and wine to become the body and blood of Jesus. Critics of the charismatic movement argue that practices such as faith healing draw <b>attention</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Mass and the communion with Christ that takes place therein.|$|E
25|$|Now reinforced, {{a second}} landing was planned by Keppel and Hodgson. After lengthy {{examination}} of the island's defences {{it was decided that}} the best chance of success was another attack at Port Andro. This time two diversionary attacks were planned to draw <b>attention</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> main effort with one in the west against Sauzon and one in the north against St Foy.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} have {{maintained}} my degrading self-control--it is all that redeems me in my own estimation to know that I could not--if he had still continued to keep his eyes on my face. His wife's tigerish jealousy came to my rescue and forced his <b>attention</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> me <b>the</b> moment he possessed himself of my hand. Her cold blue eyes caught light, her dull white cheeks flushed into bright colour, she looked years younger than her age in an instant.|$|R
5000|$|Parents of {{typically}} developing children sometimes {{fear that}} {{the special needs of}} a single [...] "fully included" [...] student will take critical levels of <b>attention</b> and energy <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rest of the class and thereby impair the academic achievements of all students.|$|R
5|$|After the September 11, 2001 attacks, media <b>attention</b> shifted <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{company and}} its troubles; {{a little less than}} a month later Enron {{announced}} its intention {{to begin the process of}} selling its lower-margin assets in favor of its core businesses of gas and electricity trading. This policy included selling Portland General Electric to another Oregon utility, Northwest Natural Gas, for about $1.9 billion in cash and stock, and possibly selling its 65% stake in the Dabhol project in India.|$|R
25|$|Emphases {{since the}} 1970s on Classic Maya hieroglyphic texts and discoveries of great {{sites in the}} {{northern}} Petén turned <b>attention</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> SMA, and a long period ensued during which proponents of a Maya Lowlands origins for Maya civilization held sway. More recently, the debate was rejoined with discoveries along the southern Pacific coast of Mexico and in Guatemala that greatly antedate developments in the Lowlands.|$|E
25|$|Four Distinguished Conduct Medals {{were also}} awarded. This {{high number of}} awards for bravery has been {{interpreted}} {{as a reaction to}} the earlier defeat at the Battle of Isandlwana – the extolling of the victory at Rorke's Drift drawing the public's <b>attention</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> great defeat at Isandlwana and the fact that Lord Chelmsford and Henry Bartle Frere had instigated the war without the approval of Her Majesty's Government.|$|E
25|$|The outside world, at {{the time}} focused on the wars of the former Yugoslavia, turned its <b>attention</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> happenings of central Africa. The {{exception}} was the international humanitarian aid community and the United Nations, for whom the Great Lakes crisis was an agonizing dilemma {{that has been the}} topic of extensive analysis and ethical arguments. As a result, UNHCR reworked its procedures to try to ensure greater international commitment in its interventions.|$|E
50|$|All {{vaccines}} {{may have}} side effects. Although almost all side effects are minor, immunization safety {{is a real}} concern. Unlike the case with most other medical interventions, vaccines are given to healthy people, which is why some people are far less willing to tolerate adverse effects of vaccines than adverse effects of other treatments. As the success of immunization programs increases and the incidence of disease decreases, public <b>attention</b> shifts <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> risks of disease {{to the risk of}} vaccination.|$|R
25|$|In {{the days}} leading up to the conflict, Gaddafi called for a rally against the {{government}} that was to be held on 17 February.

50|$|The Summer of the Shark {{refers to}} the {{coverage}} of shark attacks by American news media {{in the summer of}} 2001. The sensationalist coverage of shark attacks began in early July following the Fourth of July weekend shark attack on 8-year-old Jessie Arbogast, and continued almost unabated—despite no evidence for an actual increase in attacks—until the September 11 terrorist attacks shifted <b>the</b> media's <b>attention</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> beaches. <b>The</b> Summer of the Shark has since been remembered as an example of tabloid television perpetuating a story with no real merit beyond its ability to draw ratings.|$|R
