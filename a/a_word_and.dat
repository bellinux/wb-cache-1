25|$|The inflected {{form of a}} word often {{contains}} both one or {{more free}} morphemes (a unit of meaning which can stand by itself as <b>a</b> <b>word),</b> <b>and</b> one or more bound morphemes (a unit of meaning which cannot stand alone as a word). For example, the English word cars is a noun that is inflected for number, specifically to express the plural; the content morpheme car is unbound because it could stand alone as a word, while the suffix -s is bound because it cannot stand alone as a word. These two morphemes together form the inflected word cars.|$|E

25|$|When {{children}} reach about 15–18 {{months of}} age, language acquisition flourishes. There is {{a surge in}} word production resulting from {{the growth of the}} cortex. Infants begin to learn the words that form a sentence and within the sentence, the word endings can be interpreted. Elissa Newport and colleagues (1999) found that humans learn first about the sounds of a language, and then move on to how to speak the language. This shows how infants learn the end of <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>and</b> know that a new word is being spoken. From this step, infants are then able to determine the structure of a language and word.|$|E

They were {{initially}} supported by Task Force X, made up of 2nd Platoon, Company A, 820th Tank Destroyer Battalion and 22 men of the 820th's 2nd Recon Platoon, commanded by Lieutenant John Arculeer, who were mounted on an armored half-track and two jeeps. But shortly after the early morning German bombardment ended, Task Force X pulled out without <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>and</b> headed south. That left the 18 men of the reconnaissance platoon alone, along with four forward artillery observers, to fill in the gap.|$|E

He often invited playwrights to the rehearsals, Mohan Rakesh who had been sceptical to excessive directorial influence on {{the integrity of the}} drama-in-performance, spent three weeks with the group, in Kolkata ahead of the 1966 production of Lehron Ke Rajhans, and even rewrote the third act several times, completed two days before the opening night of the production, and revised it yet again before its publication in late 1966, and in time it became one of the important productive playwright-director relationship in Indian theatre. While working on Evam Indrajit he extensively collaborated with Sircar.|$|E

Still without a warrant, Fix sees Hong Kong as his last chance to arrest Fogg on British soil. Passepartout becomes convinced that Fix is a spy from the Reform Club. Fix confides in Passepartout, who does not believe <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>and</b> remains convinced that his master is not a bank robber. To prevent Passepartout from informing his master about the premature departure of their next vessel, the Carnatic, Fix gets Passepartout drunk and drugs him in an opium den. Passepartout still manages to catch the steamer to Yokohama, but neglects to inform Fogg that the steamer is leaving the evening before its scheduled departure date.|$|E
25|$|In {{the tables}} below the {{possibilities}} of syllable nucleus of the next-to-last syllable and their accent is shown. The different sound of a next-to-last syllable makes no grammatical distinction, for example, words nóras – wish and kū́nas – body, are of the same declensional and accentuation patterns. But {{there are a few}} certain differences in the accentuation features of the nucleus sounds of the next-to-last syllable. Most of the vocals and diphthongs can have either of the accents: a start-firm or an end-firm. Short a, e sounds, when they are in a stem of <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>and</b> stressed, lengthen and have always an end-firm accent; i, u are short and there is no accentual differentiation in their stress. Mixed diphthongs a, e + l, m, n, r have the first element lengthened when stressed in a start-firm accent, when in i, u + l, m, n, r and a diphthong ui the first element remains short in the same case. The words having ą, ę in a pre-desinential syllable are not included here {{because of the lack of}} declensional types. Some examples: rą̃stas 2 – balk, timber; žąsìs 4 – goose; ąsà 4 – handle; kę́sas 3 – hassock.|$|E

Under the republic that followed, some questioned whether Magna Carta, an agreement with a monarch, was still relevant. An anti-Cromwellian pamphlet published in 1660, The English devil, said that the nation had been [...] "compelled to submit to this Tyrant Nol or be [...] cut off by him; nothing but <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>and</b> a blow, his Will was his Law; tell him of Magna Carta, he would lay his hand on his sword and cry Magna Farta".

500|$|As a European-trained {{military}} leader, Montcalm's {{instinct was}} for large, set-piece battles in which regiments and soldiers moved in precise order. [...] Such actions required a disciplined soldiery, painstakingly drilled {{for as long}} as 18 months on the parade ground, trained to march in time, change formation at <b>a</b> <b>word,</b> <b>and</b> retain cohesion in the face of bayonet charges and musket volleys. Though his regular regiments (the [...] "troupes de terre" [...] or [...] "metropolitans") were adept at such formal warfare, {{in the course of the}} campaign their ranks had been replenished by less professional militiamen, whose talents at forest warfare emphasised the individual: they tended to fire early and then drop to the ground to reload, thus reducing the effect of concentrated fire at close range.|$|E
500|$|Morphemes can be {{classified}} according to whether they are independent morphemes, so-called roots, or whether they can only co-occur attached to other morphemes. These bound morphemes or affixes can {{be classified}} according to their position {{in relation to the}} root: prefixes precede the root, suffixes follow the root, and infixes are inserted {{in the middle of a}} root. Affixes serve to modify or elaborate the meaning of the root. Some languages change the meaning of words by changing the phonological structure of a word, for example, the English word [...] "run", which in the past tense is [...] "ran". This process is called ablaut. Furthermore, morphology distinguishes between the process of inflection, which modifies or elaborates on <b>a</b> <b>word,</b> <b>and</b> the process of derivation, which creates a new word from an existing one. In English, the verb [...] "sing" [...] has the inflectional forms [...] "singing" [...] and [...] "sung", which are both verbs, and the derivational form [...] "singer", which is a noun derived from the verb with the agentive suffix [...] "-er".|$|E
