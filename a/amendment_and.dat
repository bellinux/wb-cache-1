5|$|Most of the {{provisions}} of section 29 are plainly {{similar to those of}} the Sixth Amendment, namely the Information Clause, the Assistance of Counsel Clause, and the Compulsory Process Clause.

5|$|Republicans portrayed slavery as uncivilized {{and argued}} for {{abolition}} {{as a necessary}} step in national progress. Amendment supporters also argued that the slave system had negative effects on white people. These included the lower wages resulting from competition with forced labor, as well as repression of abolitionist whites in the South. Advocates said ending slavery would restore the First <b>Amendment</b> <b>and</b> other constitutional rights violated by censorship and intimidation in slave states.|$|E

5|$|The Marshall Court also issued {{important}} opinions regarding criminal procedure. Although the Court did {{not explicitly}} cite or quote constitutional provisions, its opinions remain influential {{in interpreting the}} Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth <b>Amendment</b> <b>and</b> venue provision of Article Three. The Court also laid down the common law rules of evidence in federal courts, including the hearsay exception for party admissions and the narrowing of the best evidence rule.|$|E
5|$|The Vicinage clause has {{its roots}} in medieval English {{criminal}} procedure, the perceived abuses of criminal vicinage and venue during the colonial period and Anti-federalist objections to the United States Constitution. The clause {{is one of the few}} constitutional criminal procedure provisions that has not been incorporated to apply to proceedings in state courts, along with the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth <b>Amendment</b> <b>and</b> (possibly) the Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth Amendment.|$|E

5|$|After the loss, MacShara {{withdrew from}} the case but Rudzewicz appealed the {{decision}} to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In the filing, Rudzewicz claimed that since they were residents of Michigan, and because the claims did not arise within the Southern District of Florida, that District Court lacked personal jurisdiction over them. Additionally Rudzewicz argued that the long-arm statute violated the 14th <b>Amendment</b> <b>and</b> was unconstitutional. Citing a similar case, World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, the Appeals court agreed with the defendants and overturned the lower court's decision. The court also agreed with Rudzewicz's assertion of the constitutionality of Florida's long arm statute in its application to the case.|$|E
5|$|Black {{adopted a}} {{narrower}} {{interpretation of the}} Fourth Amendment than {{many of his colleagues}} on the Warren Court. He dissented from Katz v. United States (1967), in which the Court held that warrantless wiretapping violated the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure. He argued that the Fourth Amendment only protected tangible items from physical searches or seizures. Thus, he concluded that telephone conversations were not within the scope of the <b>amendment,</b> <b>and</b> that warrantless wiretapping was consequently permissible.|$|E
5|$|During the {{six decades}} {{following}} the 1804 {{ratification of the}} Twelfth Amendment two proposals to amend the Constitution were adopted by Congress {{and sent to the}} states for ratification.

5|$|Following the {{unlimited}} Convention of 1901–02, {{twentieth century}} constitutional activity {{turned to a}} mixture of Governor-appointed constitutional commissions in 1927 and 1968, and limited constitutional conventions called by the General Assembly for very specific purpose. After the century's earliest convention disenfranchising voters in a constitution that was proclaimed, each modification of the Virginia Constitution has {{been sent to the}} voters for referendum approval. Virginia's women suffrage movement was unsuccessful until the national ratification of the Twenty-first <b>Amendment,</b> <b>and</b> the General Assembly did not ratify until 1952, but women could vote beginning in 1920.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, Chandler urged {{implementation}} of the state's first rural roads program and development of electrical infrastructure with assistance from the federal Rural Electrification Act. He implemented an old-age assistance program authorized by an earlier constitutional <b>amendment</b> <b>and</b> in 1938, proposed another amendment that would add dependent children and needy blind people to the state's assistance rolls. He increased funding to the state's hospitals and asylums, and personally aided with the evacuation of the Frankfort Penitentiary during the Ohio River flood of 1937. Following the flood, Chandler convinced the legislature to construct a new reformatory at La Grange.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Department of Justice {{created the}} Civil Rights Section, which focused {{primarily}} on First <b>Amendment</b> <b>and</b> labor rights. The increasing scrutiny of totalitarianism in the lead-up to World War II brought increased attention to issues of slavery and involuntary servitude, abroad and at home. The U.S. sought to counter foreign propaganda and increase its credibility on the race issue by combatting the Southern peonage system. Under the leadership of Attorney General Francis Biddle, the Civil Rights Section invoked the constitutional amendments and legislation of the Reconstruction Era {{as the basis for}} its actions.|$|E

5|$|In January 1867, Congressman Stevens {{introduced}} legislation {{to dissolve the}} Southern state governments and reconstitute them into five military districts, under martial law. The states would begin again by holding constitutional conventions. African Americans could vote for or become delegates; former Confederates could not. In the legislative process, Congress added to the bill that restoration to the Union would follow the state's ratification of the Fourteenth <b>Amendment,</b> <b>and</b> completion {{of the process of}} adding it to the Constitution. Johnson and the Southerners attempted a compromise, whereby the South would agree to {{a modified version of the}} amendment without the disqualification of former Confederates, and for limited black suffrage. The Republicans insisted on the full language of the <b>amendment,</b> <b>and</b> the deal fell through. Although Johnson could have pocket vetoed the First Reconstruction Act as it was presented to him less than ten days before the end of the Thirty-Ninth Congress, he chose to veto it directly on March 2, 1867; Congress overruled him the same day. Also on March 2, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act over the President's veto, in response to statements during the Swing Around the Circle that he planned to fire Cabinet secretaries who did not agree with him. This bill, requiring Senate approval for the firing of Cabinet members during the tenure of the president who appointed them and for one month afterwards, was immediately controversial, with some senators doubting that it was constitutional or that its terms applied to Johnson, whose key Cabinet officers were Lincoln holdovers.|$|E
5|$|In Trinsey v. Pennsylvania (1991), the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit {{was faced}} with a {{situation}} where, following the death of Senator H.John HeinzIII of Pennsylvania, Governor Robert P. Casey had provided for a replacement and for a special election that did not include a primary. A voter and prospective candidate, John S. Trinsey,Jr., argued that the lack of a primary violated the Seventeenth <b>Amendment</b> <b>and</b> his right to vote under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Third Circuit rejected these arguments, ruling that the Seventeenth Amendment does not require primaries.|$|E
5|$|In {{the state}} {{elections}} of 2012, during which {{all members of}} the legislature (but not the governor) were up for election, the shutdown was a major campaign issue. The Republicans lost their majorities in both houses of the legislature, giving the DFL full control of the state government. Kurt Zellers and other Republican legislators said the shutdown probably was one reason for their electoral defeat. However, other national and state issues may have had more of an influence on the result. The presidential race was also on the ballot, as were the proposed Minnesota Marriage <b>Amendment</b> <b>and</b> Voter ID Amendment, which had been put on the ballot by the legislature in 2011. All of these ballot items increased the turnout of DFL-leaning voters.|$|E
