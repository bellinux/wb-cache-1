5|$|About {{the time}} of the first landing in 1969, it was decided to use an {{existing}} Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground, replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20. NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing, and NASA also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming Space Shuttle. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19. The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>John</b> F.

5|$|Although {{the storm}} {{did not make}} {{landfall}} in the Philippines, its close proximity brought several days of heavy rain to Luzon, leading to widespread flash floods and mudslides. Landslides across the region isolated many cities, including Baguio. Rivers began exceeding their banks on September10 and flooded surrounding areas. In the province of Ilocos Sur, ten {{people were killed in}} a single town after flood waters swept away many homes overnight. In many areas, waters were waist-deep and officials advised residents in low-lying areas to move to higher ground. Tropical storm force winds, recorded up to 88km/h (55mph) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>John</b> Hay Air Base, also impacted the country. In Zambales Province, a tornado spawned by the typhoon injured three people and caused approximately $90,000 worth of damage. Another tornado struck the Clark Air Base, uprooting trees and damaging buildings. Losses from this tornado reached $150,000.|$|E
5|$|On March 11, the {{production}} filmed scenes {{set in a}} pig farm, where a young boy is confronted and attacked by three perpetrators. A night later, the crew shot the film's opening sequence, in which the three civil rights workers are murdered. From March 14 to March 18, the crew filmed the burning of several more churches, as well as scenes set in a farm. On March 22, the crew filmed scenes set in a morgue that was located inside the University of Mississippi Medical Center, exactly the same location where the bodies of Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner were transported. A day later, Parker and the crew filmed a scene set in a cotton field. The art department had to dress each plant with layers of cotton, as the cotton plants had not fully bloomed. The crew also filmed the abduction of Mayor Tilman (R. Lee Ermey) and his subsequent interrogation by FBI agent Monk (Badja Djola). On March 24, {{the production}} moved to Raymond, Mississippi, where the crew filmed a scene <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>John</b> Bell Williams Airport. Depicting Monk's departure, the scene was choreographed by Parker and the cast members {{so that it could}} be filmed in one take.|$|E

5|$|Steiger {{made his}} stage debut in a {{production}} of Curse you, Jack Dalton! (1946) at the Civic Repertory Theatre of Newark. Subsequent to this, he received an invitation {{from one of his}} teachers, Daniel Mann, to attend the Actors Studio, established by Elia Kazan in October 1947. It was here, along with Marlon Brando, Karl Malden and Eli Wallach, that he studied method acting, which became deeply engrained in him. Lacking matinée idol looks, much like Malden and Wallach, he began pursuing a career as a character actor rather than as a leading man. Steiger's stage work continued in 1950, with a minor role as a townperson in a stage production of An Enemy of the People at the Music Box Theatre. His first major role on Broadway came in Clifford Odets's production of Night Music (1951), where he played A. L. Rosenberger. The play was held at the ANTA Playhouse. The following year, he played a telegraphist in the play Seagulls Over Sorrento, performed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>John</b> Golden Theatre beginning on September 11, 1952.|$|E
