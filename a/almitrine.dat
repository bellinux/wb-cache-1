ABSTRACT: To test whether {{the effect of}} <b>almitrine</b> on hypoxic pul-monary vasoconstriction was dose-dependent, two series of experiments were performed on isolated rat lungs perfused with constant flow of blood. In the first series, the effects of different doses of <b>almitrine</b> on perfusion pressure were measured. Baseline perfusion pressure was not changed by solvent or by 0. 25 1 -lg·mJ- 1 <b>almitrine,</b> but it was increased by 0. 5 and 2. 0 1 -lg·mJ- 1 <b>almitrine.</b> The increase in perfusion pressure In response to 10 min ventilation with hypoxic gas mixture (5 % 01) was significantly (p< 0. 05) higher after 0. 25 l-lg·ml· 1 <b>almitrine</b> (12. 0 ± 0. ~ torr) than before addition of the drug (5. 43 ± 1. 8 torr). Responses to hypoxia were insig-nificant after higher doses (0. 5 and 2. 0 1 -lg·mi·') of <b>almitrine.</b> In the second series of experiments the responses to varying degrees of hypoxia were measured aft. er administration of one dose of <b>almitrine</b> (0. 25 1 -lg•ml·').

Resting ventilation, {{arterial blood gases}} and plasma <b>almitrine</b> levels were measured. No significant changes were seen after placebo administration. <b>Almitrine</b> 50 and 100 mg caused a significant dose-related improvement in arterial oxygen tension (PaO 2) in thirteen of the sixteen patients. <b>Almitrine</b> 150 mg caused little if any additional PaO 2 increment.

30|$|Experimentally, <b>almitrine</b> {{increases}} hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, {{except where}} strong vasoconstriction is already present [31]. In patients with ARDS, <b>almitrine</b> causes a redistribution of {{blood flow to}} well-ventilated areas and improves oxygenation [32] while increasing pulmonary artery pressure [33 – 35]. It is suggested that low-dose <b>almitrine</b> enhances hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, whereas at high doses (> 20 μg/kg/min), it would induce diffuse and inefficient vasoconstriction [36, 37]. In this sense, dosages of 2 to 4 μg/kg/min {{have been shown to}} be optimal in most patients [34, 38, 39]. <b>Almitrine</b> has additive effects on oxygenation with iNO in approximately two thirds of iNO responders [25, 38]. However, some patients may be responders to <b>almitrine</b> while they did not respond to iNO [25, 38]. The effectiveness of <b>almitrine</b> on oxygenation often is reduced in septic patients receiving norepinephrine [23, 24]. Therefore, the use of higher doses of <b>almitrine</b> (16 μg/kg/min) may produce further improvement in oxygenation in patients receiving norepinephrine if they are responders to iNO [26]. The efficiency of prolonged administration of <b>almitrine</b> has not been evaluated. Because of an increased pulmonary artery pressure, high doses of <b>almitrine</b> (16 μg/kg/min) may result in reduced right ventricular ejection fraction [40]. Therefore, <b>almitrine</b> is not recommended in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension or acute cor pulmonale. The prolonged administration of <b>almitrine</b> has been involved in peripheral neuropathies in COPD patients [41, 42]. This complication was usually associated with circulating levels > 400 ng/ml. While intravenous administration of 16 μg/kg/min of <b>almitrine</b> in patients with ARDS was associated with levels > 400 ng/ml in 16 of 17 patients, a dosage of 4 μg/kg/min resulted in high levels in only one patient [32], suggesting that this dosage would be safe on the neurological function. The <b>almitrine</b> also may have liver toxicity [43]. A reversible and dose-dependent increase in lactate level associated with impaired liver function was observed in 8 of 25 patients in the first 24 hours of administration of 2 of 8 μg/kg/min of <b>almitrine</b> [43]. As for iNO, a frequent and quick effect on oxygenation supports the optional use of <b>almitrine</b> in patients with very severe hypoxemia on a trial basis, until the institution of other means of support. The absence of response to the administration of 0.5 mg/kg in 30 minutes does not justify any continued administration.|$|E
40|$|<b>Almitrine</b> Bismesylate (ABM) is {{a highly}} lipophillic {{compound}} of molecular weight 669. 7, under development as a peripheral chemoreceptor stimulant {{in the treatment of}} chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Its pharmacokinetics and metabolism were investigated in animals and man. Following oral administration of [14 C]-ABM, absorption of radioactivity is rapid and variable in man, rat, rabbit and dog. Plasma levels of radioactivity decline rapidly after both oral and intravenous administration, suggesting rapid uptake into tissues. A high affinity of <b>almitrine</b> for the carotid body of the urethane-anaesthetised rat confirms a prolonged and specific action of the compound. Elimination of radioactivity is slow and mainly faecal and independent of administration route or species. Recovery of the adminstered radioactivity is incomplete in all other species except rat and in man, only 86 to 94 % of the administered dose was recovered in 140 days. This slow elimination may be due to repeated gut secretion and reabsorption of <b>almitrine.</b> <b>Almitrine</b> is metabolised by oxidation and N-dealkylation of the allyl side chain to form, respectively, the di- and tetrahydroxy <b>almitrine</b> and mono and di-deallyl <b>almitrine</b> with the corresponding dihydroxy monodeallyl <b>almitrine.</b> The major faecal metabolite in all species is tetrahydroxy <b>almitrine</b> (not found in plasma) and all species had qualitatively similar metabolic patterns to man both in-vivo and in-vitro from liver microsomes. The pharmacokinetics of unchanged <b>almitrine</b> in man shows a rapid absorption from both solution and tablet formulations. Absorption is increased (48 %) in the presence of food and bioavailability is high (74 %). A large volume of distribution (3100 litres) and low clearance (64 ml. min- 1) are consistent with a long half-life (614 to 1164 h). Plasma protein binding is high (99 %) in all species and is not affected by drugs likely to be coadministered with <b>almitrine.</b> Clinically, there is a relationship between <b>almitrine</b> plasma concentration and changes in Pa 02 from baseline during repeated administration. Some patients with high plasma levels of <b>almitrine</b> (> 300 ng. ml- 1) experienced peripheral paresthesia which is reversible.

40|$|International audienceRats {{were exposed}} to a 3 -wk regimen of chronic normobaric hypoxia, with or without <b>almitrine</b> treatment.

40|$|Hypoxic {{stimulation}} of the peripheral chemoreceptors inhibits hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). On the other hand, <b>almitrine,</b> a peripheral chemoreceptor agonist, {{has been reported in}} some studies to enhance HPV. To further explore this apparent contradiction, we investigated the effects of two different low intravenous doses of <b>almitrine</b> on pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) versus cardiac index (Q) plots in 32 pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs ventilated alternatively in hyperoxia (FIO 2, 0. 4) and in hypoxia (FIO 2 0. 1). HPV, defined as a hypoxia-induced increase in Ppa over the entire range of Q studied, from 2 to 5 L/min/m 2, was elicited in 16 dogs. In the first eight of these "responders," <b>almitrine</b> 2 micrograms/kg/min had no vascular effect, and in the other eight, <b>almitrine</b> 4 micrograms/kg/min inhibited HPV. In 16 other dogs, hypoxia did not affect Ppa over the entire range of Q. In these "nonresponders," <b>almitrine</b> 2 micrograms/kg/min (n = 8) as well as 4 micrograms/kg/min (n = 8) restored HPV. To answer the question whether the ability to restore HPV would be specific to <b>almitrine,</b> we administered intravenously the structurally unrelated chemoreceptor agonist doxapram at the dose of 20 micrograms/kg/min to an additional group of eight "nonresponders," and this treatment also restored HPV.

40|$|<b>Almitrine</b> and doxapram, two {{structurally}} unrelated peripheral chemoreceptor agonists, {{have been}} shown to enhance hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in anesthetized dogs. We hypothesized that these drugs would increase pulmonary vascular tone and improve gas exchange in canine lung injury caused by oleic acid (OA). Pulmonary hemodynamics and gas exchange were investigated in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs before and after intravenously administered OA 0. 09 ml/kg and again after placebo (n = 6), <b>almitrine</b> 2 micrograms/kg/min (n = 6), or doxapram 20 micrograms/kg/min (n = 6) in a randomized order. Cardiac output (Q) was manipulated using a femoral arteriovenous bypass and an inferior vena cava balloon catheter to construct mean pulmonary artery pressure (Ppa) -Q plots in order to discriminate active from passive changes in Ppa. Gas exchange was assessed by measuring arterial PO 2 and intrapulmonary shunt, determined using a sulfur hexafluoride infusion. OA increased Ppa over the range of Q studied, and it deteriorated gas exchange by an increase in intrapulmonary shunt. After OA, placebo had no effect on Ppa, arterial PO 2, or intrapulmonary shunt. Both <b>almitrine</b> and doxapram further increased Ppa at all levels of Q studied, but they did not affect indices of gas exchange after OA. We conclude that in this experimental model of acute lung injury, <b>almitrine</b> and doxapram induce pulmonary vasoconstriction without, however, diverting blood flow toward better oxygenated lung regions. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{respiratory}} {{effects of}} intravenously infused <b>almitrine</b> were evaluated in healthy volunteers. In the dose range 0 - 25 - 1 - 0 mg/kg/hour it caused large and dose-dependent increases in hypoxic chemosensitivity, which were longlasting and more persistent than the drug ' s retention in the plasma. Increases in sensitivity to hypercapnia {{were much less}} and were detected only when the plasma <b>almitrine</b> exceeded 200 ng/ml. Small increases in resting ventilation and metabolic rate with a decrease in mixed venous carbon dioxide tension occurred only at the highest infusion rate. The findings accord with an action of <b>almitrine</b> in the peripheral chemoreceptors, which may be of therapeutic value in managing some cases of respiratory failure. <b>Almitrine</b> is a piperazine derivative which stimulates respiration in animals by {{an effect on the}} peripheral chemoreceptors but has no central activity. Thus its administration to anaesthetised dogs increases the neural discharge from their carotid body chemoreceptors, causing hyperpnoea only if the carotid sinus and vagus nerves are intact. Such stimulation evoked by intravenous injection of the drug is prolonged. ' The principal biological function of the peripheral chemoreceptors is to increase ven-tilation in hypoxia, 2 whereas most of the ventilatory response to hypercapnia is mediated centrally. 3 The present study was done to examine the respiratory effects and their duration when <b>almitrine</b> was infused intravenously in healthy man. Respiratory measurements were obtained not only during breathing of room air but also during the inhalation of either carbon-dioxide-enriched or hypoxic gas mixtures. In {{the first part of the}} investigation double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were per-formed with the drug given in a single dosage. Then the activity of the drug was examined on separate test days with three different doses. Methods The experimental subjects were 15 healthy medical students or doctors aged 22 - 42 years.

40|$|<b>Almitrine,</b> a {{peripheral}} chemoreceptor agonist, {{has been reported}} to increase arterial O 2 saturation (SaO 2) without changing minute ventilation (VE) during hypoxic exercise (Giesbrecht et al. J. Appl. Physiol. 70 : 1770 - 1774, 1991). To explain this finding, we studied pulmonary hemodynamics (right heart catheterization) and gas exchange (multiple inert gas elimination technique) in six healthy volunteers at rest and during heavy exercise in normobaric normoxia (fractional concentration of O 2 in inspired air 0. 21) or hypoxia (fractional concentration of O 2 in inspired air 0. 125), before and after 75 mg of <b>almitrine</b> taken orally. During normoxic exercise, at a mean O 2 uptake (VO 2) of 4. 0 l/min, <b>almitrine</b> increased arterial PO 2 (PaO 2) (P < 0. 05), SaO 2 (P < 0. 01), and VE (P < 0. 05) and decreased arterial PCO 2 (P < 0. 01), without affecting pulmonary hemodynamics or ventilation-perfusion distributions. During hypoxic exercise, at a mean VO 2 of 3. 0 l/min, <b>almitrine</b> increased SaO 2 (P < 0. 01) and VE (P < 0. 01) and decreased arterial PCO 2 (P < 0. 05), with no effect on PaO 2 or on ventilation-perfusion distributions and with a slight pulmonary vasoconstriction (P < 0. 01). <b>Almitrine</b> during hypoxia did not affect cardiac output or calculated O 2 diffusing capacity, but it did increase the slope of the VE/VO 2 relationship (P < 0. 01). We conclude that during hypoxic exercise, a pharmacological stimulation of the peripheral chemoreceptors improves SaO 2 but not PaO 2 by means of increased ventilation and an associated leftward shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve.

40|$|Despite {{the lack}} of effect on the lung {{mechanics}} and ventilation distribution, a definite improvement in gas exchange was observed after <b>almitrine</b> bismesylate without {{any change in the}} minute ventilation and pattern of breathing. Moreover, neither the increases in PaO 2 nor the decrease in PaCO 2 could be related to the changes in the alveolar ventilation, confirming that the improvement in the V̇a/Q̇ ratios distribution is a very important mode of action of <b>almitrine</b> bismesylate besides its direct effects on the peripheral chemoreceptors observed mainly when higher dosages than in the present study are used.

40|$|Eighty nine {{patients}} with hypoxic chronic obstructive airways disease (COAD) were enrolled into the 1 year Vectarion International Multicentre Study-VIMS in 4 centres, Sheffield (UK), and Antwerp, Liege and Namur (Belgium). At {{the end of}} the year the remainder were invited to continue taking placebo or <b>almitrine</b> bismesylate (100 - 200 mg daily) in the same double blind manner for a further 12 months. In the <b>almitrine</b> treated patients mean arterial oxygen tension (Pao 2) at {{the end of the}} treatment period improved from 7. 5 (0. 5) kPa to 8. 2 (1. 3) kPa (p less than 0. 01) and arterial carbon dioxide tension (Paco 2) fell from 6. 1 (0. 8) kPa to 5. 8 (0. 9) kPa (p less than 0. 01). Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and measurements of breathlessness were unchanged. In the placebo treated group changes in the above variables were not significant. Twenty nine {{patients with}}drew from the <b>almitrine</b> group with seven deaths and six cases of peripheral neuropathy, and 22 patients withdrew from the placebo group with six deaths and two cases of peripheral neuropathy. Death rates between the groups were not significantly different. In conclusion, 2 yrs of <b>almitrine</b> treatment (100 - 200 mg daily) leads to a persistent slight improvement in PaO 2 and PaCO 2 but no benefit in survival was demonstrated.

30|$|Dysregulated inflammation, {{accumulation}} {{and activity}} of leukocytes and platelets, uncontrolled activation of coagulation and altered permeability of alveolar endothelial and epithelial barriers leading to pulmonary edema are key {{points in the}} pathophysiology of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1]. ARDS results in impaired gas exchange and hypoxemic respiratory failure, which can be refractory and life-threatening [2]. Besides ventilatory support, pharmacological interventions are commonly considered {{throughout the course of}} ARDS. Some of these interventions affect supportive care, such as fluid management or neuromuscular blockers (NMBs), whereas others are focused on recovery from hypoxemia or have been studied in patients with persistent ARDS. The present review will summarize clinical results and practical aspects of pharmacological interventions, which are more largely used by clinicians. The current evidence about inhaled nitric oxide, <b>almitrine,</b> NMBs, fluid management, β 2 -agonists, and corticosteroids will be addressed successively.|$|E
