Fat blends were developed to find the most appropriate mixture fitting the technological needs. In our work palm mid fraction (PMF) was mixed with <b>anhydrous</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> (AMF), goose fat (G), and lard (L) in a 1 : 1 ratio. <b>Anhydrous</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> represents fat consisting of a wide range of fatty acids. Goose fat is a soft, easily melting fat, and lard is characterized as animal fat with wide melting temperature interval. The measurements aimed to establish the miscibility of the fats and the effect of animal fats on the melting-solidification profile of palm mid fraction. SFC vs temperature curves, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) melting thermograms describe the melting profile of the samples. Isotherm crystallization by SFC vs time curves and DSC cooling thermograms were measured to characterize the solidification of pure fats and the blends. Since the SFC curves did not show crosspoints we concluded that fats blended in a 1 : 1 ratio were miscible. <b>Anhydrous</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> strongly modified the properties of palm mid fraction, the blend became similar to <b>anhydrous</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fat.</b> Goose fat had no strong modification effect on palm mid fraction and could be considered as a softening agent.

The polymorphic behavior of AGMF was monitored by varying the cooling rates between 5 and 1 °C/min from 45 to - 20 °C with their subsequent melting at 1 °C/min. Quenching of AGMF at - 20 °C was also examined to determine the metastable polymorphic form of AGMF. At intermediate cooling rates, TGs in AGMF crystallize, from about 18 °C in two different lamellar structures with triple chain length 3 LR stacking of 72 Å and a double chain length 2 LR stacking of 48 Å, which are correlated to two overlapped exothermic peaks recorded by DSC. A reversible transition sub R T R was observed. Subsequent heating at 1 °C/min shows numerous structural rearrangements before final melting. At fast cooling of AGMF (5 °C/min), similar unstable crystalline varieties are formed while three endotherms are recorded. Several new unstable lamellar structures are observed after quenching. All of these data are compared to those previously reported at slow cooling (0. 1 °C/min) showing a relative stability of the structures formed.

Five aroma compounds were investigated: amyl and isoamyl acetate, ethyl pentanoate, hexanal and t- 2 -hexenal. Skim milk, <b>anhydrous</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> and full-fat cream were chosen as dairy media, while water was used as a reference medium. Apparent partition coefficients of the five aromas were determined between the air and media between 30 and 80 °C by static headspace-gas chromatography. Partition coefficients over full-fat cream were also calculated from partition coefficients over skim milk and <b>anhydrous</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fat.</b> Compared with water, a significant retention of t- 2 -hexenal was observed in skim milk (nearly 90 % whatever the temperature), whereas the retention of the other aromas varied from 6 % for isoamyl acetate to 40 % for hexanal in skim milk. Hydrophobic interactions were responsible for the retention of esters, whereas covalent binding of t- 2 -hexenal by dairy proteins was probably involved.

40|$|There is a {{constant}} need of new synthetic emulsifiers in the food industry. Sugar esters are widely used as food grade synthetic emulsifiers, amongst which sucrose esters are the most common. Although sucrose esters are used very frequently, {{little is known about}} the use of lactose esters in food. There is a need for characterization of lactose esters before they can be used in foods. The objective of this study was to characterize a lactose ester, lactose monolaurate (LML) as an antimicrobial agent on food pathogens, evaluate its effect on 20 % oil-in-water emulsions as an emulsifier, and to explore its effect on crystallization behavior of <b>anhydrous</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fat.</b> In the first study (Chapter 3), the effect of LML was evaluated on survival of some Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. For Listeria monocytogenes, a concentration of 1 mg/ml showed some inhibition in growth media whereas the cells were completely killed at 5 mg/ml. For Mycobacteria, an LML concentration between 0. 1 - 1 mg/ml was lethal. Scanning electron microscopy was also conducted to examine any changes in the morphology of cells. Listeria exhibited a change in morphology and a wrinkling effect was shown in Mycobacteria. In the second study (Chapter 4), the effect of LML as an emulsifier was evaluated in 20 % oil-in-water emulsions. The use level of LML was comparable to commercially available emulsifier polysorbate 20, and produced comparable stabilization in the emulsions upon use. In this study, an attempt was also made to optimize the synthesis of LML with respect to the immobilized enzyme and solvent combination. It was concluded that for 20 % oil-in-water emulsions, LML is a promising emulsifier at 0. 5 %. In the third study (Chapter 5), the effect of LML was evaluated at two concentrations on the crystallization behavior of <b>anhydrous</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> at two temperatures with high and low supercooling. On application of high intensity ultrasound (HIU) to <b>anhydrous</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> (AMF) at 31 °C and 0. 05 % LML the effect on viscosity of sample and crystallization behavior was evaluated.

The cows were grazing fresh pasture, and in addition one of the pair was provided with a daily supplement of encapsulated sunflower oil. The <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> of the cow given the supplement (18 : 2 -rich <b>milk</b> <b>fat)</b> contained 15. 5 % 18 : 2 compared with 1. 8 % 18 : 2 in the <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> of the other cow (control <b>milk</b> <b>fat).</b> This increase in the proportion of 18 : 2 in the <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> was accompanied by decreases in the proportions of myristic acid (14 : 0) and palmitic acid (16 : 0). The effect of this altered fatty acid (FA) composition on the TG composition of the 18 : 2 -rich <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> was to increase the proportions of TGs with 40, 52 and 54 acyl carbons and to decrease the proportions of TGs with 34, 36, 38, 44, 46, 48 and 50 acyl carbons relative to the proportions in the control <b>milk</b> <b>fat.</b> Both <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> samples were separated, by column chromatography on silicic acid, into TG fractions of high, medium and low molecular weight. The relative proportions of the TG fractions of high, medium and low mol. wt. in the 18 : 2 -rich <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> were 43. 0, 19. 5 and 37. 5 % respectively compared with 36. 1, 19. 7 end 44. 2 % respectively in the control <b>milk</b> <b>fat.</b> Stereospecific analysis of these triacylglycerol fractions demonstrated that in fractions of similar mol. wt., the distribution of fatty acids within the TG molecule in the presence of high levels of 18 : 2, was not appreciably altered from that in the triacylglycerol fractions of the control <b>milk</b> <b>fat.</b> The positional distribution of fatty acids in the triacylglycerols of the total <b>milk,</b> <b>fats</b> was also similar. In the <b>milk</b> <b>fat,</b> containing high levels of linoleic acid, 18 : 2 showed a preference for positions 1 and 2 in the triacylglycerols of the low and medium mol. wt. fractions, and for positions 2 and 3 of the high mol. wt. fraction. The three TG fractions of each <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> were further resolved into TG classes of differing levels of unsaturation. The 18 : 2 -rich <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> contained higier levels of the unsaturated TGs, namely the diene, triene and tetraene TGs, and lower levels of the saturated TGs {{and to a lesser extent}} the monoene TGs. The diene TGs of the 18 : 2 -rich <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> included combinations of 18 : 2 with two saturated FAs, which are a minor constituent of normal <b>milk</b> <b>fats.</b> Likewise the triene TGs reflected the presence of 18 : 2 in combination with 18 : 1 and a saturated FA.

If the <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> ratio tends to be preferable, the six different scenarios leading to {{a variation of the}} <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> ratio provide useful indications for management planning strategies. Although management actions to reduce the negative effects of heat cannot be applied to each individual within a large production system (André et al. 2011), our present analysis highlights only six different required treatment strategies. Further, these may be reduced to the three major cases shown in Figure 3. Appropriate management action can be taken regarding feed composition and the prioritised allocation of cows in the barn. For Case 2, in which the production of <b>milk</b> and <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> increase, no special treatment is actually required despite a decrease in the <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> ratio. The reason for this is the faster increase of milk production compared to that of <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> yield. For Case 5, cows are strongly affected by heat, but the <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> ratio increases.

Homogenisation of fat globules led to the partial disruption of the MFGM and to the adsorption of milk proteins. Moreover, this study showed that in cheeses, <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> can be dispersed as (i) fat globules with the MFGM, (ii) aggregates of fat globules, (ii) homogenised fat globules, (iii) free fat and (iv) a combination of different phases and structures. The knowledge of the supramolecular structure of <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> in dairy products is of primary importance regarding its technological, sensorial and nutritional properties...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this field}} study was to {{investigate}} whether the incidence of cystic ovarian disease (COD) in dairy cows was related to milk production parameters (<b>milk</b> yield, <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> and protein) in early lactation with special emphasis on the negative energy balance (NEB). The diagnosis of COD was made by rectal palpation performed by veterinarians experienced in gynaecology. Data used for this field study were collected from November 1986 onwards. The dataset consisted of 6911 lactations (3891 cows) on 29 herds including 600 cases of COD (8. 7 %). Lactations in the COD group had higher average maximum productions of milk, energy corrected <b>milk,</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> and protein than lactations in the non-COD group. The average maximum milk fat:protein ratio did not significantly differ between the groups. Daily changes of the average maximum <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> and protein percentage and of total <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> and protein yield were calculated and divided into four groups depending on the day of first milk recording. No significant relations were found between changes in <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> and protein percentage and total <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> and protein yield, and the incidence of COD. It is concluded that elevated average peak <b>milk</b> yield, <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> and protein yield in early lactation are risk factors for the incidence of COD, but the average milk fat:protein ratio is not. In this field study changes in <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> percentage and <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> yield, indicative for the presence of NEB, did not show a relation with the incidence of COD in early lactating cows.

40|$|Milk fats with {{different}} concentrations {{of water and}} phospholipids (PL) were crystallised isothermally under static conditions and their crystallisation behaviour was monitored by Differential Scanning calorimetry (DSC) and pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance (pNMR). The Avrami and the Gompertz models, which were fitted by non-linear regression, described the crystallisation process. A significant effect of phospholipid concentration was observed using both techniques (DSC and pNMR). Especially the induction time and the Avrami growth rate constant were altered: higher amounts of PL delayed the onset of static crystallisation. A similar effect of PL on the crystallisation kinetics was observed in a small-scale fractionation. Moreover, the filtration time of the crystal suspension and melting properties of the stearin were strongly affected {{by the presence of}} higher concentrations of PL. These observations emphasise the importance of the adequate removal of PL during <b>anhydrous</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> production. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThermal {{fractionation}} of <b>anhydrous</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> {{with high}} initial content of {{low molecular weight}} TAGs was performed based on a 22 factorial experimental design with three central and two axial points. The independent variables were the crystallization temperature and the cooling rate. A 2. 0 L agitated glass reactor was used and the rotation was kept at 20 rpm. The filtration was performed under vacuum (500 mmHg), using a 14 μm average pore diameter filter paper. Curves of isothermal crystallization of the stearin fraction showed that increasing the crystallization temperature, increases the induction period and decreases the maximum solid content of stearin. An increase of the crystallization temperature resulted {{in an increase in}} solid fat content. All runs achieved an efficient fractionation using a single separation step and stearin with defined characteristics can be obtained adapting the process conditions...|$|E

S. imports butter and other high milk fat products that can substitute for a strict definition of butter. These products include dairy spreads, butter substitutes, <b>anhydrous</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fat,</b> and food preparations. The U. S. imports these high milk fat products under a tariff-rate quota system (TRQ) implemented by the World Trade Organization (WTO). This study quantified all the milk fat contained in U. S. butter and butter substitute imports. A conceptual model was developed to explain imports of these products under a TRQ system. And an econometric model was estimated to analyze the economic factors that drive over-quota imports. The model found that the wedge between U. S. and world butter prices explains much of the incentive to import overquota butter and butter substitutes. International Relations/Trade,...|$|E

The distribution of TG in goat <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> was unimodal, peaking at C 40 (12. 6 %); the sum of TG from C 38 to C 44 accounted for about 50 %, whereas the three classes of TG from C 48 to C 52 did not exceed 6 % each. These results were compared with the corresponding data for cow <b>milk</b> <b>fat.</b> Significant differences between herds were observed, mainly in long-chain TG. To detect foreign <b>fats</b> in goat <b>milk</b> <b>fat,</b> two multiple regression equations based on TG content of the goat <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> were proposed.
