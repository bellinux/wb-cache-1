5|$|Like its predecessor, Riven {{is a point}} <b>and</b> <b>click</b> {{adventure}} {{game played}} from a first-person perspective. The player explores immersive environments depicted through a large series of computer generated stills using mouse clicks for movement or to manipulate objects within reach. By operating mechanical contraptions and deciphering codes and symbols discovered in the surroundings, the vaguely explained goal can eventually be reached.|$|E
50|$|Bricks <b>and</b> <b>clicks</b> (aka <b>clicks</b> <b>and</b> bricks, <b>click</b> <b>and</b> mortar, bricks, <b>clicks</b> <b>and</b> flips, Womble Store Method (WSM) or WAMBAM) is a jargon {{term for}} a {{business}} model by which a company integrates both offline (bricks) <b>and</b> online (<b>clicks)</b> presences, sometimes with the third extra flips (physical catalogs). Additionally, many will also offer telephone ordering and mobile phone apps, or at least provide telephone sales support. The advent of mobile web has made businesses operating bricks <b>and</b> <b>clicks</b> businesses especially popular, because it means customers can do tasks like shopping when they have spare time {{and do not have}} to be at a computer. Many of these users prefer to use mobile shopping sites.|$|R

[...] It {{has been argued}} that a bricks <b>and</b> <b>clicks</b> business model is more difficult to implement than an online only model. In the future, the bricks <b>and</b> <b>clicks</b> model may be more successful, but in 2010 some online only businesses grew at a staggering 30%, while some bricks <b>and</b> <b>clicks</b> businesses grew at a paltry 3%. The key factor for a bricks <b>and</b> <b>clicks</b> business model to be successful [...] "will, to a large extent, be determined by a companyâ€™s ability to manage the trade-offs between separation and integration" [...] of their retail and online businesses.|$|R

5|$|Broken Sword: The Angel of Death (Secrets of the Ark: A Broken Sword Game in North America) is a 3D point-and-click {{adventure}} game {{developed by}} Revolution Software and Sumo Digital, which {{was released in}} 2006 in Europe and Australia and in 2007 in North America. Being released only on Windows, {{it is the only}} game in the Broken Sword series not to be released on any console. The player assumes the role of George Stobbart, an American patent lawyer, as he and Anna Maria, a girl with an old manuscript, search for a great treasure that the manuscript leads them to. The game uses a point <b>and</b> <b>click</b> interface, though George's moves can be controlled using a keyboard.|$|E
5|$|Broken Sword: The Angel of Death uses both a point <b>and</b> <b>click</b> {{and direct}} control interface. The player guides George Stobbart's {{movements}} with a mouse or keyboard, and Nicole Collard {{is also a}} playable character in selected portions of the game. George must collect objects {{that can be used}} with other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or other people in the game world to solve puzzles and progress in the game. George can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of {{what needs to be done}} to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. As in the first three Broken Sword games, the death of the player character is possible in The Angel of Death.|$|E
5|$|Clock Tower is a {{survival}} horror point-and-click adventure game developed {{and published by}} Human Entertainment for the Super Famicom in 1995. It is the first installment in the Clock Tower series. The story follows orphan Jennifer Simpson soon after she is adopted by the Barrows family along with other orphaned girls. With the introduction of Scissorman, the game's antagonist, {{one of the other}} children is killed. Jennifer must then explore the Barrows Mansion {{to find a way to}} escape while evading Scissorman, leading to one of the game's multiple endings. Clock Tower utlizes a point <b>and</b> <b>click</b> interface with the player controlling a cursor to direct Jennifer's actions.|$|E

5|$|Kathrin Romary Beckinsale (born 26 July 1973) is an English actress. After {{some minor}} {{television}} roles, {{she made her}} film debut in Much Ado About Nothing (1993) while still {{a student at the}} University of Oxford. She appeared in British costume dramas such as Prince of Jutland (1994), Cold Comfort Farm (1995), Emma (1996), and The Golden Bowl (2000), in addition to various stage and radio productions. She began to seek film work in the United States in the late 1990s and, after appearing in small-scale dramas The Last Days of Disco (1998) and Brokedown Palace (1999), she had starring roles in the war drama Pearl Harbor and the romantic comedy Serendipity. She followed those with appearances in The Aviator (2004) <b>and</b> <b>Click</b> (2006).|$|E
5|$|The Cretaceous saw the fragmenting of the {{southern}} landmass, {{with the opening of}} {{the southern}} Atlantic Ocean and the isolation of New Zealand, while South America, Antarctica, and Australia grew more distant. The diversity of Cupedidae and Archostemata decreased considerably. Predatory ground beetles (Carabidae) and rove beetles (Staphylinidae) began to distribute into different patterns; the Carabidae predominantly occurred in the warm regions, while the Staphylinidae <b>and</b> <b>click</b> beetles (Elateridae) preferred temperate climates. Likewise, predatory species of Cleroidea and Cucujoidea hunted their prey under the bark of trees together with the jewel beetles (Buprestidae). The diversity of jewel beetles increased rapidly, as they were the primary consumers of wood, while longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae) were rather rare: their diversity increased only towards the end of the Upper Cretaceous. The first coprophagous beetles are from the Upper Cretaceous and may have lived on the excrement of herbivorous dinosaurs. The first species where both larvae and adults are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle are found. Whirligig beetles (Gyrinidae) were moderately diverse, although other early beetles (e.g. Dytiscidae) were less, with the most widespread being the species of Coptoclavidae, which preyed on aquatic fly larvae.|$|E
5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} feeds on a {{diverse range of}} {{invertebrates}} and small vertebrates, though plant matter does constitute {{a major part of}} its diet. It is known to eat beetles, including weevils, rove beetles, <b>and</b> <b>click</b> beetles from the genus Psephus, butterflies, ants from the genera Dorylus and Pachycondyla, grasshoppers, cockroaches from the family Blattidae, earwigs, caterpillars, ant-lions, silverfish, and earthworms. Small lizards, frogs, snails, and slugs are also eaten, as are crabs from the genus Potamon, fruits, flower buds, mosses, and leaves. Fish have also been identified as a prey item in Nigeria. At at least one nesting site, it relies heavily on the arthropods feeding on the bat guano near the cave for sustenance, while this behaviour has been reported to a lesser extent at other sites. It is known to regurgitate what it has eaten in pellet form. Overall, between 52 and 60 percent of the bird's diet is believed to be composed of animals. Rove beetle larvae and ants were the most frequently eaten prey in a study in Nigeria.|$|E

25|$|Early {{video games}} {{such as the}} 1986 text {{adventure}} Trinity combined elements of science fiction, fantasy and magic realism. In his essay Half-Real, MIT professor and ludologist Jesper Juul argues that the intrinsic nature of video games is magic realist. Point <b>and</b> <b>click</b> adventure games such as the 2017 release Memoranda have recently embraced the genre. 2013 release Kentucky Route Zero is also deeply entrenched in magical realist tradition.|$|E

25|$|The Settlers III is a {{real-time}} strategy game, controlled via a point <b>and</b> <b>click</b> interface, {{in which}} the primary goal on most maps {{is to build a}} settlement with a functioning economy, producing sufficient military units so as to conquer rival territories, ultimately gaining control of either the entire map, or a certain predetermined section of it. To achieve this end, the player must engage in economic micromanagement, construct buildings, and generate resources.|$|E

A fiber-optic connector is basically a rigid cylindrical barrel surrounded by a sleeve that holds the barrel in its mating socket. The mating mechanism can be push <b>and</b> <b>click,</b> turn and latch (bayonet mount), or screw-in (threaded). The barrel is typically free to move within the sleeve, and may have a key that prevents the barrel and fiber from rotating as the connectors are mated.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{adventure}} games {{developed in}} the 1970s and early 1980s were text-based, using text parsers to translate the player's input into commands. As personal computers became more powerful {{with the ability to}} show graphics, the graphic adventure game format became popular, initially by augmenting player's text commands with graphics, but soon moving towards point <b>and</b> <b>click</b> interfaces. Further computer advancements led to adventure games with more immersive graphics using real-time or pre-rendered three-dimensional scenes or full-motion video taken from the first- or third-person perspective.|$|E
