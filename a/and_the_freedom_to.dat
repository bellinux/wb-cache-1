5|$|The Academy at Saint Petersburg, {{established}} by Peter the Great, {{was intended to}} improve education in Russia and to close the scientific gap with Western Europe. As a result, it was made especially attractive to foreign scholars like Euler. The academy possessed ample financial resources and a comprehensive library drawn from the private libraries of Peter himself and of the nobility. Very few students {{were enrolled in the}} academy in order to lessen the faculty's teaching burden, and the academy emphasized research and offered to its faculty both the time <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> pursue scientific questions.|$|E
5|$|The Right to Freedom {{is covered}} in Articles 19-22, with the view of guaranteeing {{individual}} rights that were considered vital by {{the framers of the}} Constitution, and these Articles also include certain restrictions that may be imposed by the State on individual liberty under specified conditions. Article 19 guarantees six freedoms in the nature of civil rights, which are available only to citizens of India. These include the freedom of speech and expression, freedom of assembly without arms, freedom of association, freedom of movement throughout the territory of our country, freedom to reside and settle in any part of the country of India <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> practice any profession. All these freedoms are subject to reasonable restrictions that may imposed on them by the State, listed under Article 19 itself. The grounds for imposing these restrictions vary according to the freedom sought to be restricted, and include national security, public order, decency and morality, contempt of court, incitement to offences, and defamation. The State is also empowered, {{in the interests of the}} general public to nationalise any trade, industry or service to the exclusion of the citizens.|$|E

25|$|Kitsikis {{regards the}} Greek {{language}} as {{the cornerstone of}} planetary civilization, and he thus deems it an honour for one {{to be able to}} write in Greek.

25|$|Engels' {{ideas on}} the role of {{property}} {{in the creation of the}} modern family and as such modern civilization begin to become more transparent in the latter part of Chapter 2 as he begins to elaborate on the question of the monogamous relationship <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> enter into (or refuse) such a relationship. Bourgeois law dictates the rules for relationships and inheritances. As such, two partners, even when their marriage is not arranged, will always have the preservation of inheritance in mind and as such will never be entirely free to choose their partner. Engels argues that a relationship based on property rights and forced monogamy will only lead to the proliferation of immorality and prostitution.|$|E

25|$|In 1811, Robert Fulton and Robert R. Livingston {{were the}} first to enter the {{potentially}} lucrative field of steamboat commerce west of the Allegheny Mountains. They established an operation in Pittsburgh, where their steamboats were also built, and another in New Orleans, the busiest port in the West. During this age, a steamboat builder could receive a federal patent that provided both protection from being copied <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> navigate any of the country's waterways. Fulton had been granted a federal patent but so had several others, including Daniel French. Fulton and Livingston decided to take additional measures to prevent another steamboat company from beginning operations on the western rivers. To this end they petitioned the states bordering the western rivers for a grant of an exclusive privilege to ply their waters by steamboat. Their requests were turned down by every state except Louisiana which granted them an exclusive privilege in 1814. In states where they did not have an exclusive privilege, Livingston and Fulton resorted to litigation under their federal patent to prevent competition.|$|E

500|$|Travel is {{a common}} theme in American {{autobiography}} as a whole; as McPherson stated, it {{is something of a}} national myth to Americans as a people.

Like those narratives that focused on the writers' search for freedom from bondage, modern African-American autobiographers like Angelou sought to develop [...] "an authentic self" [...] <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> find it in their community. Scholar Yolanda M. Manora called the travel motif in Angelou's autobiographies [...] "fluidity". [...] This fluidity began in Caged Bird and was a metaphor for her psychological movements and growth caused by her displacement and trauma throughout the book, something Manora stated Angelou had to escape in order to transcend it. As Hagen stated, Angelou structured Caged Bird into three parts: arrival, sojourn, and departure, with both geographic and psychological aspects.|$|E
500|$|In his 2008 National Day Rally speech, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong {{indicated}} that the purpose behind various government policies, including the creation of Speakers' Corner, was to [...] "liberalise our society, to widen the space for expression and participation". Its reception was mixed, however, {{and there have been}} a wide range of views and perspectives on the impact of Speakers' Corner in increasing the space for free speech <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> assemble. It has been called an [...] "exercise in tokenism" [...] for the purpose of preserving a literal [...] "space" [...] for engaging in free speech while also [...] "cornering" [...] it in that space. This is reflected in the relative lack of progress towards liberalization in other areas such as awards of high damages in libel lawsuits brought by politicians which has been said to have a chilling effect on political speech in Singapore. Former Workers' Party member James Gomez has also expressed concerns about the effectiveness of the Speakers' Corner as a site of vibrant political debate, citing the lack of a [...] "culture of speaking" [...] amongst Singaporeans. The ban on racially or religiously sensitive speech has been criticized as possibly curtailing free speech on genuine political matters and limiting the scope of constitutionally entrenched fundamental liberties.|$|E

Game Informer called it [...] "one of the best experiences in gaming" [...] and complimented the story, setting, and game play. Yahoo!

They also complimented the online multiplayer, the setting, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> play the game with or without the DS's special functions, but criticized some of the dialog. IGN stated that the game was not [...] "the mind-blowing revelation that Dawn of Sorrow was", but still complemented the [...] "solid" [...] game play and called it an enjoyable experience.

500|$|Todd Gilchrist feels Sparrow is {{the only}} element of the films that will remain timeless. According to Sharon Eberson, the character's {{popularity}} {{can be attributed to}} his being a [...] "scoundrel whose occasional bouts of conscience allow viewers to go with the flaws because, as played to the larger-than-life hilt by Depp, he owns every scene he is in". Film history professor Jonathan Kuntz attributed Sparrow's popularity to the increased questioning of masculinity in the 21st century, and Sparrow's personality contrasts with action-adventure heroes in cinema. Leonard Maltin concurs that Sparrow has a carefree attitude and does not take himself seriously. Mark Fox noted Sparrow is an escapist fantasy figure for women, free from much of the responsibility of most heroes. Sparrow is listed by IGN as one of their ten favorite film outlaws, as he [...] "lives for himself <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> do whatever it is that he damn well pleases. Precious few film characters have epitomized what makes the outlaw such a romantic figure for audiences as Captain Jack Sparrow has." [...] Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] "Part Keith Richards rift, part sozzled lounge lizard, Johnny Depp's swizzleshtick pirate was definitely one of the most dazzling characters of the decade." [...] In June 2010, Sparrow was named one of Entertainment Weekly 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years.|$|E
