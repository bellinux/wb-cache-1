40|$|Abstract — Safe vehicle {{guidance}} under {{human or}} computer control requires {{a thorough understanding}} of the traversed environment. Consequently if perception systems are to be introduced into mass market vehicles as part of driving assistance systems, their proper operation throughout the vehicle working life is needed. Onboard stereo-vision systems can provide rich information in terms of range, feature recognition, etc., hence the interest by car OEMs. System performance depends on multiple factors like light conditions, algorithms and the mechanical apparatus. Due to inaccuracies produced by changes in the system physical properties due to vibrations, misalignment of fixtures, etc. through the vehicle operational life a reduction in performance will occur. In this paper, an evaluation framework to estimate the performance of a vehicle onboard stereo-vision system in terms of 3 D measurements and re-projection errors is presented. The approach considers changes that might occur in the system during the vehicle working life. It includes means to evaluate the self-calibration process often used to correct the effects of physical changes in the stereo-vision system. The results provide key information for the design and geometrical specification of automotive stereo-vision systems. As the potential physical changes in the geometric configuration of the camera-pair over the vehicle life time are difficult to predict, it was necessary to simulate them to generate families of errors that these might trigger on the system performance. The results of the observations and analysis are included; these should <b>assit</b> designers <b>to</b> define the constraints that needed for the layout of cameras as part of the design process.

40|$|Passamos por um período de grandes descobertas para a ciência, mas o homem ainda {{continua}} sem desvendar o processo de morte e morrer. A morte ainda é um grande mistério que o amedronta; é vista como um tabu, tema interditado e fracasso profissional. Partindo do pressuposto de que os profissionais de enfermagem têm preparo insuficiente para lidar com pacientes em iminência de morte, traçamos como objetivo desse estudo: investigar como os profissionais de enfermagem vivenciam o processo de morte e o morrer das crianças/adolescentes hospitalizados, onde buscam preparo e apoio para enfrentar essa perda e identificar que tipo de apoio eles oferecem à família durante o processo de morte e morrer de seus filhos. Pela natureza dos objetivos propostos, este estudo é de natureza qualitativa. Os participantes são enfermeiros, auxiliares e técnicos de enfermagem que trabalham em clínicas com leitos pediátricos de um hospital-escola do interior do estado de São Paulo, que tenham vivenciado o processo de morte e morrer das crianças/adolescentes que estiveram sob seus cuidados. Os dados empíricos foram coletados mediante entrevista e organizados em três temas: enfrentando a morte, estratégias de apoio e luto da equipe. Os resultados indicam que os profissionais de enfermagem negam a morte nos hospitais e acreditam que sua função é salvar vidas; oferecem apoio afetivo e emocional às famílias; buscam apoio principalmente na equipe de trabalho e na família e vivem o luto pela morte de seus pacientes. Concluímos, a partir desses resultados, que os profissionais de enfermagem estão necessitando de suporte emocional e educacional para lidarem com a morte de forma mais harmoniosa e assistirem às reais necessidades das crianças e adolescentes que estão em iminência de morte. Recomendamos que seja incluído nos currículos o tema da morte e que as instituições hospitalares busquem a educação permanente como estratégia para promover mudanças de posturas dos profissionais junto ao paciente que está morrendo. We are in {{a period}} of great advancements in science, but men are still seeking to understand the process of death and dying. Death is a great scary mystery, it is seen as a taboo, a theme that we must no approach and considered a professional failure. Basead on the presupposition that the nursing professional is not well prepared to cope with patients tha are dying, the goals of this study were: to investigate how nursing professionals experience the process of death and dying of hospitalized children and adolescents, to verify where they find preparation and support to face this loss and to identify what kind of support they offer to the families during the process of death and dying of their child/adolescent. Due {{to the nature of the}} objectives proposed, this study is considered qualitative. Subjects were nuses, nursing auxiliaries and technicians who work in pediatric wards at a university hospital in the state of São Paulo, Brazil and who had experienced the process of death and dying of children/adolescents that were receiving the care provided by them. Empirical data were collected through interviews and were organized in there themes: facing death, support strategies and team mourning. Results indicated that nursing professionals deny death in the hospitals and believe that their function is to save lives; they offer affective and emotional support to families; they look for support mainly within the working team and family and they experience the mourning due to the death of their patients. Author concluded, based on these results that the nursing professionals need emotional and education support in order to cope with death in a more natural way and <b>to</b> <b>assit</b> the children and adolescents real necessities whwn they are dying. The author recommends the inclusion of the theme death in the curricula and also that hospitals must for permanent education as a strategy to promote changes in posture of the professionals that provide care to patients who are dying...|$|R
40|$|Das 20 S Proteasom spielt zusammen mit seinem 19 S Regulator als 26 S Proteasomkomplex eine zentrale Rolle beim Abbau von Proteinen in eukaryotischen Zellen. Dem 19 S Regulator wird dabei die Funktion der Substraterkennung und -entfaltung sowie die Beteiligung an der Translokation der entfalteten Substrate zum katalytischen Zentrum zugeordnet. In dieser Arbeit konnte erstmals gezeigt werden, daß der 19 S Regulator chaperonähnliche Eigenschaften besitzt, dadurch also durchaus die Entfaltung der Proteinsubstrate bewirken kann. Durch den 19 S Regulator war das 26 S Proteasom in der Lage, einen Teil denaturierter Citratsynthase, eines Modellsubstrats für die Untersuchung von Chaperonaktivitäten, ATP-abhängig zum nativen Zustand zurückzufalten. Desweiteren führte die Anwesenheit des 19 S Regulators bzw. des 26 S Proteasoms in Abwesenheit von ATP zu einer Aggregationshemmung denaturierter Citratsynthase. Auch konnte die direkte Interaktion zwischen der Citratsynthase und dem 26 S Proteasom bzw. dem 19 S Regulator durch Glyceroldichtegradientenzentrifugation gezeigt werden. Diese chaperonähnlichen Eigenschaften des 19 S Regulators konnten dem aus sechs ATPasen und zwei nicht-ATPasen bestehenden Base-Subkomplex zugeordnet werden. Aufgrund der Wechselwirkungen zwischen dem 19 S Regulator und dem 20 S Proteasom und damit möglicherweise verbundenen Konformationsänderungen in den Komplexen, wurde postuliert, daß der 19 S Regulator auch auf die Biogenese, also die Assemblierung und Reifung des 20 S Proteasoms einen Einfluß haben könnte. Es konnte gezeigt werden, daß Mutationen in den 19 S ATPasen zu einer Anreicherung der unprozessierten proteasomalen 20 S Untereinheit beta 5 bei erhöhter Temperatur führen. Die Ursache dieses Anreicherungseffektes konnte nicht aufgeklärt werden. Der Effekt läßt sich nicht auf eine Hochregulation der m-RNA-Synthese der beta 5 -Untereinheit zurückführen. Die Beteiligung des 19 S Regulators an frühen Assemblierungsstadien des 20 S Proteasoms ist aufgrund der Analyse der mit dem Maturierungsfaktor Ump 1 im Komplex vorliegenden Proteine ebenfalls unwahrscheinlich. Eine Beteiligung des 19 S Regulators an einem der letzten Schritte der 20 S Proteasomenbiogenese, beispielsweise an der Katalyse der Prozessierung der beta-Untereinheiten, ist eher vorstellbar, konnte aber nicht eindeutig gezeigt werden. Auf die Prozessierung der beta-Untereinheiten hat aber auch die katalytische Aktivität der beta-Untereinheiten einen nicht unwesentlichen Einfluß. So werden die katalytisch aktiven Untereinheiten durch Autokatalyse zu ihrer aktiven Form prozessiert und bewirken die Prozessierung der katalytisch inaktiven Untereinheiten beta 6 und beta 7. Dies konnte so auch durch Inaktivierung der beta 2 i-Untereinheit bestätigt werden. Die Expression der inaktiven Maus-beta 1 iT 1 A-Untereinheit in humanen T 2 -Zellinien verhinderte ihre eigene vollständige Prozessierung, hatte aber auch Einfluß auf die Prozessierung von beta 7 und von inaktiv exprimierten beta 1 i (Maus-beta 1 iT 1 A). In {{eukaryotic}} cells {{the protein}} degrading proteasome/ubiquitin system {{is involved in}} a wide variety of regulatory processes. The 26 S proteasome is composed of two subcomplexes, a proteolytic core (20 S) and a regulatory complex (19 S). It is proposed that the proteins of the 19 S regulatory complex can recognize and unfold the substrates. Furthermore the RC participates in translocation of the substrates into the proteasomes inner chamber were peptide bond hydrolysis occurs. This work shows that the proteasome exhibits an ATPdependent chaperon-like activity on citrate synthase, a model substrat for chaperones. Human and yeast proteasomes stimulated the recovery of the native structure of citrate synthase in an ATPdependent manner. Furthermore the 19 S complex was able to supress the aggregation of denatured citrate synthase. Glycerol gradient analysis indicated that proteasome facilitates the refolding of citrate synthase through the formation of citrate synthase-proteasome complexes as expected for a chaperon-like mechanism. The chaperonlike activity was mapped to the base of the 19 S regulatory complex. The RC could be able to unfold protein substrates in the 26 S proteasome by this activity. The crystal structure of S. cerevisiae 20 S proteasome shows a closed gate to the proteasome interiors. The 19 S regulatory complex may induce conformational changes not only to open the protease cavity but also <b>to</b> <b>assit</b> in beta-subunit processing during 20 S proteasome biogenesis. To test this hypothesis some yeast 19 S ATPase mutant strains were analyzed for defective 20 S proteasome maturation by following the processing of beta 5 -subunit. This work has shown that some mutations in these ATPases led to an accumulation of the unprocessed proteasomal beta 5 -subunit at restricted temperature. This effect was not due to the upregulation of beta 5 mRNA transcription. It is not very likely that proteins of the RC participate in early steps of proteasome biogenesis, since they could not be found in precurser intermediates containing the maturation factor Ump 1 p. However, they might be important for later assembly steps. During biogenesis five prosequence containing beta subunits have to be processed. This proceeds via a two-step mechanism involving autocatalytic or transcatalytic processing by neighbouring subunits. The proposed mechanism could be confirmed by inactivation of the beta 2 i subunit via substitution of the active site Threonin 1 against Alanin (beta 2 iT 1 A). The inactivation blocked the autocatalysis of beta 2 i and influenced the processing of beta 7 and that of inactivated beta 1 i (beta 1 iT 1 A) ...|$|R
