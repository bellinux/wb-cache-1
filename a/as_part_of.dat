40|$|In this thesis, I will {{consider}} {{various aspects of}} the contemporary free will debate from a consequentialist perspective. In chapter 1, I will endorse a particular theory of what matters in life and a certain view of what moral rightness consists in. In chapter 2, I will provide an outline of all the various freedoms that have been proposed <b>as</b> (<b>parts</b> <b>of)</b> accounts of free will and of all the various responsibilities that have been proposed <b>as</b> (<b>parts</b> <b>of)</b> accounts of moral responsibility. In chapter 3, then, I will proceed to argue in favor of my first main thesis – that, of all the freedoms that have been proposed <b>as</b> (<b>parts</b> <b>of)</b> accounts of free will, all valuable freedoms are compatible with determinism, and that, of all the responsibilities that have been proposed <b>as</b> (<b>parts</b> <b>of)</b> accounts of moral responsibility, all valuable responsibilities are compatible with determinism (evaluative compatibilism). Finally, in chapter 4, I will argue in favor of my second main thesis – that, of all the freedoms that have been proposed <b>as</b> (<b>parts</b> <b>of)</b> accounts of free will, all valuable freedoms exist in the actual world and that, of all the responsibilities that have been proposed <b>as</b> (<b>parts</b> <b>of)</b> accounts of moral responsibility, all valuable responsibilities exist in our world, but that everyday and scientific observations do indicate that we have some valuable freedoms and responsibilities to a lesser degree than would be ideal (critical evaluative optimism). I do not expect to have convinced you, {{by the end of this}} thesis, that my ethical theories are the most intuitive ones; and neither do I expect to convince all of you that both (or either) of my main theses are (is) correct. What I do hope to convince you of, however, is that ethics is more important to the free will debate than many seem to think. For some ethical theories, the problem of free will simply does not have an edge. That is something we should all acknowledge...|$|R
