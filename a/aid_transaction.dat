40|$|The term ‘transaction cost’ {{has been}} widely {{mentioned}} in the recent literature on aid effectiveness. In fact, the shift into the aid delivery system (see e. g. the Paris Declaration on aid effectiveness) has been justified among others by the high transaction costs generated by the previous aid modalities. In this paper, we first want {{to understand what the}} notion of transaction costs means in the context of aid delivery and give a typology of the possible costs. We also develop an analytical framework to evaluate them. This framework appears to be a relevant tool to compare the effectiveness of aid modalities.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents three {{essays on}} foreign aid effectiveness. Chapter 1 presents {{the role of}} monitoring procedures in improving the effectiveness of foreign aid. It analyzes how monitoring procedures influence the government’s effort and improve the effectiveness of foreign aid. The chapter considers two cases, the {{case in which the}} donor has unrestricted aid budget and the case where the donor has a fixed aid budget. The main concern in this chapter is determining the optimal contract for the donor that maximizes the effectiveness of the aid given her aid budget when she dealing with aid-recipients in the presence of moral hazard problem. The model analyzes the monitoring procedures between two players, donor and recipient in a one-shot game. It assumes that the decision to monitor and the choice of the recipient 2 ̆ 7 s action are taken simultaneously. It suggests that with a fixed aid budget the donor is unlikely to invest heavily in monitoring cost and reward payment since the primary purpose of such aid is to help the poor in the recipient country. The reward payment which provides incentives for the recipient to work does indeed have a stronger effect on the likelihood of project success. It also shows that both the probability of monitoring and the optimal reward respond differently to change in monitoring cost. Chapter 2 studies the effect of aid-recipient governance on the allocation of foreign aid. It examines the hypothesis that better governance can reduce <b>aid</b> <b>transaction</b> cost which increases the assistance received by developing countries. The following questions were the main concern of this chapter, does better governance increase the amount of foreign aid delivered to developing countries? Do donors consider the levels of recipient’s governance when they allocate their funding? The chapter adopts annual data on a group of 67 developing countries covering Africa, and South Asia for the period from 2003 to 2014. It shows a positive relationship between two of our six governance indicators and the quantity of foreign aid. In fact, only control of corruption and voice and accountability have statistically significant effect on the amount of aid. It also shows that control variables have important effect in the determinate of foreign aid expect GDP per capita. Chapter 3 studies the impact of aid-recipient governance on aggregate welfare in developing countries. It investigates whether the effect of foreign aid on human development depends on the level of governance in recipient countries. These relationships are explored in an econometric analysis, 2 SLS estimation, of panel data for the period from 2003 to 2014 in a sample of 67 developing countries. Our hypothesis is that better governance provides a better environment for foreign aid donor to achieve their goals. The main findings show that aid has a positive impact on human development only when it interacts with two out of the six indicators of governance: control of corruption and political stability. Aid by itself and military expenditures {{have a negative impact on}} the human development index...|$|E

This paper seeks to examine in depth the behaviour of two prominent GHIs {{in the early stages of}} their operation in Uganda as well as the responses of the government. Methods The study adopted a qualitative and case study approach to investigate the governance of <b>aid</b> <b>transactions</b> in Uganda. Data sources included documentary review, in-depth and semi-structured interviews and observation of meetings. Agency theory guided the conceptual framework of the study. Results The Ugandan government had a stated preference for donor funding to be channelled through the general or sectoral budgets. Despite this preference, two large GHIs opted to allocate resources and deliver activities through projects with a disease-specific approach. The mixed motives of contributor country governments, recipient country governments and GHI executives produced incentive regimes in conflict between different aid mechanisms. Conclusion Notwithstanding attempts to align and harmonize donor activities, the interests and motives of the various actors (GHIs and different parts of the government) undermine such efforts. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In some cases, {{complementary}} {{products are}} sold to {{different sets of}} agents to <b>aid</b> in <b>transactions</b> between them. In {{the context of a}} simplified model, this paper shows that a monopolist has an incentive to integrate into and foreclose other sellers of a complementary product used in fixed proportions with the monopolized product, but which is sold to different consumers. While these latter consumers are made worse off by integration and leverage, output is expanded and the monopolist’s original consumers are made better-off. The effect of integration and leverage on overall welfare is uncertain. I illustrate this model with an example involving trucking fleet cards (sold to trucking companies) and fuel desk point-of-sale systems (sold to truck stops) that are used in conjunction when diesel fuel is purchased. 1 The views expressed in this paper are the author’s, not necessarily those of the Federal Trade Commission or any individual Commissioner.

40|$|This {{working paper}} investigates how aid has been {{constructed}} {{as a moral}} activity in Swedish non-governmental fundraising for the Somalia Famine of 2011 – 2012. Fundraising material of four NGOs is examined: the Swedish Red Cross, Save the Children Sweden, Médecins Sans Frontières Sweden, and Diakonia Sweden. Using a moral economy approach, the paper identifies a central discourse in which NGOs present themselves as givers of charity. They depict the aid they provide as a commendable, non-obligatory act for which they take the moral credit. This view reaffirms the existence of moral hierarchies of power between givers and recipients of aid. The notion that people in distress are entitled to aid is thereby repudiated. At the same time, NGOs break the aid chain when they characterize their role as being the sole provider of <b>aid.</b> How <b>transactions</b> between donors, NGOs, and recipients should best be understood is not clear at present. In fact, the NGOs studied do not only construct aid as charity, {{but also as a}} right, resulting in conflicting moral economies.

40|$|The Problem: Many {{economic}} markets, including major stock exchanges, employ market-makers to <b>aid</b> in the <b>transactions</b> {{and provide}} a better quality market. Market-makers supply an advantage to the market. By consolidating the trading in a few agents, the market becomes more efficient. Traders wishing {{to buy and sell}} do not need to find each other or wait for each other’s arrival. Additionally, by quoting a single price which is guaranteed for all traders, market-makers remove the price fluctuations thatoccur in markets where buyers and sellers must come to their own agreement for a price individually for each transaction. Markets with market-makers have greater volumes and better price stability. Many major markets are now electronic. The NASDAQ is a distributed trading system completely run through networked computers. It uses competing market-makers (usually one per major trading company) to maintain a high quality market. However, the demands on human market-makers are high. A typical market-maker will be responsible for 10 to 20 securities. At any given moment, it is only feasible for the market-maker to be actively attentive to 2 to 3 of them. The market-maker is generally losing potential profit or volume on the other securities. The last few years have also seen the growth of on-line trading systems. These systems are also entirely electronic and usually employ no market making.

40|$|The lack of {{consistent}} and reliable levels of nutritious food {{may be one}} of the most brutal results of poverty. Beyond the human suffering, the lack of food security has damaging economic consequences, making it difficult for communities to break poverty cycles. This dissertation studies the various decisions made by households, governments, and the international community that impact household food security. Food security, the long-term availability of nutritious foods, is essentially achieved through a trade-off of consumption and investment in assets and capital to ensure future availability of food. Chapter 2 builds an optimal control model to analyze the trade-offs between stocks of primary forest and agricultural production. This study highlights the role of ecosystem services provided by stocks of forests, which include protection from flooding and erosion, maintenance of soil quality, and contributions to healthy watersheds. The model developed analyzes food production and consumption decisions in the context of sufficient and consistent access to food, particularly represented by changes in the stock of natural capital, in this case primary forest, which is utilized by the population for various reasons, including being cleared to create room for agriculture production. The case study of forest stocks in Nepal demonstrates the cost reductions achieved in the agriculture sector due to the presence of forest stock. The analysis determines optimal levels of per capita agriculture land for the three geographic belts of Nepal: Terai, Hills, and Mountain regions. Steady states in the model are reached beyond 200 years. Chapter 3 employs data from a World Food Program household survey carried out in 2005, analyzes the role of natural capital, social capital, coping strategies, and levels of violence in determining household food security levels. Using remotely sensed data of two time points [...] Thematic Mapper (TM) of 1990 and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) of 2000, vegetation information was derived for the uses of mapping of vegetation quality, the study uses two-stage ordinary least squares and non-linear spatial modeling econometric techniques to analyze the data. The results indicate household food security is positively impacted by higher levels of vegetation cover in the village where a household is located, as well as by higher vegetation quality in areas surround the village. Time spent accessing drinking water from improved sources is observed to have a negative relationship with food security. The existence of social networks was seen to positively impact food security, while households identified as members of a lower caste relate negatively with food security. Coping strategies analyzed include remittances received by the household, access to financial credit, and the receipt of food aid. All of these strategies have a positive impact on the level of household food security. The intensity of violence in the village and surrounding areas throughout the Maoist conflict is observed to have a negative impact on household food security. Chapter 4 undertakes a dynamic panel analysis of the worldwide distribution of emergency food aid in response to natural disasters and the displacement of citizens due to conflict. This is important, as exogenous shocks have the potential to derail the optimal consumption and investment decisions made by households aiming to ensure long-term food security. The data comes from the United Nations WFP Food Aid Information System (FAIS), which aims to provide reliable crosschecked data on all food <b>aid</b> <b>transactions</b> by countries and NGOs, whether or not the food aid was distributed by WFP. The analysis uses a Generalized Method of Moments system approach, which allows a control of the dynamic nature of the data, as well as potential endogeneity issues. As in previous studies, we show a significant relationship between rapid onset disasters (e. g. floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes) and the international response of food aid. Unique to this study, we demonstrate a lag effect of aid in response to gradual onset disasters (droughts, extreme temperature, and disease). This is a particularly important response when considering the potential for increased gradual onset natural disasters in response to climate change. We also show a highly significant and positive relationship between emergency food aid and displaced people. The dissertation provides important results for advising government policy makers and non-governmental organizations to further address food security needs in developing countries. This research highlights the importance of natural and social capital quality in determining food security. Policy implications include investing in measures to conserve natural resources, both in local communities and in surrounding regions. Also, it is important for policies to ensure long-term investment in community groups and networks that improve knowledge transfer and the social safety nets needed by those most at risk. The optimal control model provides insight into the long-term balance between natural capital quality and food production. The combination of spatial information derived from the integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing tools with econometric modeling provides an important picture of the relationship between household food security and nearby vegetation quality, and vegetation quality in areas further away. The dynamic panel analysis of shocks and food aid indicates a need for improved strategies in addressing food security in the critical moments of disasters. EconomicsDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.

30|$|In this framework, it is {{unlikely}} that international cooperation might influence the selection of emigrants by affecting the distribution of rewards to skill in LDCs. However, aid might help to ease migration costs in several ways: i) <b>Aid</b> might reduce <b>transaction</b> costs by providing opportunities for the highly skilled to migrate thanks to the attribution of scholarship grants, and ii) reduce informational costs by providing information on donor countries, as aid creates bridges between the receiving and the donor countries. iii) Aid might also create networks and screen high level professionals by providing direct contacts and opportunities for top workers to get a job abroad. iv) Finally, although international cooperation might not influence the wage-skill profile, aid might allow migration costs to be affordable by supporting growth, contributing to finance national incomes and thus increase wages (via income). There is evidence showing that if aid does foster development, it induces migration, see Rotte and Vogler (2000). However, the aggregate effect on self-selection is unknown, an increase in LDCs’ wages may help willing unskilled or skilled emigrants to bear the costs of migration (overcome budget constraints), but it might also incentivate them to stay at home. Whether the skilled or the unskilled are more sensitive to changes in income is unclear. Orrenius and Zavodny (2005), for example, find that better economic conditions in Mexico provide a higher disincentive to migrate among undocumented skilled Mexicans than among the undocumented unskilled. Moreover, if the migration costs are decreasing in skill level as in Chiquiar and Hanson (2005), an improvement of the economic conditions would alleviate mainly the liquidity constraints faced by the skilled.|$|R

However, technological advancements have meant that some service organisations have changed their service delivery processes by substituting contact personnel with service delivery technologies. Consequently, consumers have been producing and delivering services for themselves by interacting with the service delivery technologies that are available (Bancel-charensol, 1999). Researchers assert that changing the characteristics of the service delivery process can result in changes in how consumers evaluate the quality of services provided by organisations and how they assess their resulting levels of dis/satisfaction (Chase, 1978; Lovelock 2 ̆ 6 Young, 1979; Gronroos, 1984; Zeithaml, Parasuraman, 2 ̆ 6 Beny, 1990). As such, this {{study examined}} the effects that retail banking technologies have on consumers 2 ̆ 7 evaluations of the service encounter and how these evaluations translate into usage patterns. Data were collected using qualitative and quantitative research methodologies. The minimum of the qualitative phase of the study was to identify the criteria that consumers are likely to use when evaluating their technology-based banking transactions and the paradoxes of technology adoption that they are likely to experience. Twenty in-depth interviews were conducted with consumers who reported they use at least one of the four modes of electronic banking. The interviews were tape-recorded and analysed using N. U. D. I. S. T. software. The second phase of the study examined consumers 2 ̆ 7 opinions towards relevant criteria identified in the qualitative phase and the effect these criteria have on consumers 2 ̆ 7 use of the four modes of el« 1 ronic banking. Data for this stage were collected through a mail survey questionnaire that was mailed out to a sample of 1700 Western Australians. In total, 453 useable questionnaires were returned. The data were imported into SPSS v. 10 and analysed using non-parametric statistics. This study showed that consumers are likely to evaluate their electronic banking service encounters on the basis of perceived convenience, <b>transaction</b> <b>aids</b> available, and perceived risk. The findings also indicate that these criteria have sub dimensions. Perceived convenience relates to the perceived ease of transactions, perceived speed of transactions, and accessibility to consumers 2 ̆ 7 transaction accounts from different locations and beyond the bank 2 ̆ 7 s traditional operating hours. The <b>transaction</b> <b>aids</b> include the voice prompts available with telephone banking and the visual cues available with Online banking. Perceived risk dimensions include psychological, performance, financial, and physical risks. The present study also showed that some criteria have a greater effect on consumers 2 ̆ 7 use of some modes of electronic banking than others. For instance, in regards to voice prompts, psychological and performance risks appeared to have an effect on the number of tell-phone banking transactions consumers are likely to conduct. Consumers who use electronic banking can experience six of the eight paradoxes of technology adoption identified by Mick and Fournier (199 g) : freedom/enslavement, control/chaos, engaging/disengaging, efficiency/inefficiency, fulfils/create needs, and competence/incompetence. The findings showed that in most case one side of the paradox dominates. It appears that existing theories, instruments, and techniques of evaluating the service encounter need to be adapted to be applicable to technology-assisted service encounter;. Specifically, these theories, instruments, and techniques need to minimise or exclude elements that require consumers to evaluate their interactions with and perceptions of organisations 2 ̆ 7 customer service personnel and replace them with dimensions relating to consumers’ interactions with the technologies that facilitate the service delivery process. However, an exception needs to be made for technology-assisted service encounters conducted using the telephone because in these service encounters consumers can access organisations 2 ̆ 7 customer service representatives, The findings were used to propose the TASE (technology-assisted service encounters) model, which includes items relating to the three main dimensions of perceived convenience, <b>transaction</b> <b>aids,</b> and perceived risk. The TASE model can be adapted and used to measure consumers’ evaluation of the service delivery processes of organisations in various service industries. The findings of this study have significant managerial applications. Organisations can use these findings to assess the viability of commercial technologies that they intend to implement by examining consumers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of new technologies based on the relevant criteria and paradoxes identified in this study. In addition, organizations can use these findings to develop promotional strategies that address consumers 2 ̆ 7 concerns about using technology-based service delivery options in order to encourage them to participate more in the service delivery process. In addition the proposed T ASE model can be used to develop an instrument for measuring consumers 2 ̆ 7 levels of dis/satisfaction with technology-based service encounters in general...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} Swedish postal service, focusing on its organization from approximately 1600 to 1720. The {{purpose of the}} study is to explain why the Swedish state, at different points of time, chose one form of postal organization over another. The principle question of the dissertation has been: How was the Swedish postal service organized during the 1600 s, what were the forms of organization chosen, and why did the state shift between these? In a broader perspective, the dissertation has investigated how {{the answers to these questions}} affect our perception of how the Swedish state organized its agencies in the seventeenth century. The analysis relies on a theoretical model inspired by economist Oliver E. Williamson’s transaction cost theory, modified to function for a study of seventeenth-century Swedish society. The concepts “market” and “hierarchy” is central to this theory. They denote the ways in which enterprises and agencies can be organized. How choices can be made between the two alternatives has been explained by the <b>aid</b> of a <b>transaction</b> cost analysis. The concept of market has been reformulated in the dissertation, and instead of market, the term “contract” has been used. This term denotes an organization where the crown handed over the leadership of the postal organization to some private individual. The analysis focuses on the shifts between the state’s centralized control of the postal organization, labeled hierarchy, and the above-mentioned form of contract. The principle question is why these shifts in the organization of the postal service took place, and what changes these shifts entailed. The investigation is based on a wide variety of sources, complementing material from the central administration — e. g. minutes, ordinances and fiscal material — with, for example, letters written by persons who were central actors in the Swedish state. The dissertation shows that the Swedish postal service during the 1600 s was organized according to both contractual and hierarchical principles. During the period under research, the postal service alternated between being incorporated into the government administration and being contracted out to some private individual. The state occasionally relinquished control over the postal service, leaving it to entrepreneurs to handle. At other times, the state centralized the postal service’s administration, putting it under direct government control. The investigation has problematised a formerly standard picture of the Swedish postal service. Hereafter, the Swedish postal service must be regarded as an organization in which both models coexisted. The Swedish state tried both contract-oriented and hierarchical organizations during the 1600 s; indeed the organization oscillated between these two poles...|$|R
6000|$|It {{is curious}} {{that the first}} measure of {{commercial}} policy in this session {{should have been a}} measure of protection {{in the shape of a}} bill introduced by the board of trade, imposing a duty on corn, wheat, and flour brought from the United States into Canada.[156] But this was only a detail, though a singular one, in a policy that was in fact a continuance of the relaxation of the commercial system of the colonies which had been begun in 1822 and 1825 by Robinson and Huskisson. In his present employment Mr. Gladstone was called upon to handle a mass of questions that were both of extreme complexity in themselves, and also involved collision with trade interests always easily alarmed, irritated, and even exasperated. With merchants and manufacturers, importers and exporters, brokers and bankers, with all the serried hosts of British trade, with the laws and circumstances of international commerce, he was every day brought into close, detailed, and responsible contact:--Whether the duty on straw bonnets should go by weight or by number; what was the difference between boot-fronts at six shillings per dozen pairs and a 15 per cent. duty ad valorem; how to distinguish the regulus of tin from mere ore, and how to fix the duty on copper ore so as not to injure the smelter; how to find an adjustment between the liquorice manufacturers of London and the liquorice growers of Pontefract; what was the special case for muscatels as distinct from other raisins; whether 110 pounds of ship biscuits would be a fair deposit for taking out of bond 100 pounds of wheat if not kiln-dried, or 96 pounds if kiln-dried; whether there ought to be uniformity between hides and skins. He applies to Cornewall Lewis, then a poor-law commissioner, not on the astronomy of the ancients or the truth of early Roman history, but to find out for a certain series of years past the contract price of meat in workhouses. He listens to the grievances of the lath-renders; of the coopers who complain that casks will come in too cheap; of the coal-whippers, and the frame-work knitters; and he examines the hard predicament of the sawyers, who hold government answerable both for the fatal competition of machinery and the displacement of wood by iron. 'These deputations,' he says, 'were invaluable to me, for by constant close questioning I learned the nature of their trades, and armed with this admission to their interior, made careful notes and became able to defend in debate the propositions of the tariff and to show that the respective businesses would be carried on and not ruined as they said. I have ever since said that deputations are most admirable <b>aids</b> for the <b>transaction</b> of public business, provided the receiver of them is allowed to fix the occasion and the stage at which they appear.' ...|$|R
