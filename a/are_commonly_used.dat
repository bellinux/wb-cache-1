5|$|Modular broaches <b>are</b> <b>commonly</b> <b>used</b> {{for large}} {{internal}} broaching applications. They {{are similar to}} shell broaches {{in that they are}} a multi-piece construction. This design is used because it is cheaper to build and resharpen and is more flexible than a solid design.|$|E
5|$|The {{monument}} {{has been}} repaired several times. Initially in 1777 {{and again in}} 1828 and then in 1879, each time the repairs were funded by Granville's descendants.

5|$|Actinium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive, {{metallic}} element. Its estimated {{shear modulus}} {{is similar to}} that of lead. Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium glows in the dark with a pale blue light, which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles. Actinium has similar chemical properties to lanthanum and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and ion chromatography <b>are</b> <b>commonly</b> <b>used</b> for the separation.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises <b>are</b> <b>commonly</b> <b>used</b> in {{traditional}} medicine across their geographic range, {{a practice that}} has been reported since at least 1900.

5|$|Certain diamond {{enhancement}} techniques <b>are</b> <b>commonly</b> <b>used</b> to artificially {{produce an}} array of colors, including blue, green, yellow, red, and black. Color enhancement techniques usually involve irradiation, including proton bombardment via cyclotrons; neutron bombardment in the piles of nuclear reactors; and electron bombardment by Van de Graaff generators. These high-energy particles physically alter the diamond's crystal lattice, knocking carbon atoms out of place and producing color centers. The depth of color penetration depends on the technique and its duration, {{and in some cases}} the diamond may be left radioactive to some degree.|$|E
