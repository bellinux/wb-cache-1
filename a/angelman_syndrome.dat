5|$|In {{identical}} twins, if one {{is affected}} there is a 50–60% chance that the other will also be affected. In non-identical twins the risk is 15%. These risks are greater in those with generalized rather than focal seizures. If both twins are affected, {{most of the time}} they have the same epileptic syndrome (70–90%). Other close relatives of a person with epilepsy have a risk five times that of the general population. Between 1 and 10% of those with Down syndrome and 90% of those with <b>Angelman</b> <b>syndrome</b> have epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|Syndromes {{in which}} causes are not clearly {{identified}} {{are difficult to}} match with categories of the current classification of epilepsy. Categorization for these cases was made somewhat arbitrarily. The idiopathic (unknown cause) category of the 2011 classification includes syndromes in which the general clinical features and/or age specificity strongly point to a presumed genetic cause. Some childhood epilepsy syndromes {{are included in the}} unknown cause category in which the cause is presumed genetic, for instance benign rolandic epilepsy. Others are included in symptomatic despite a presumed genetic cause (in at least in some cases), for instance Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Clinical syndromes in which epilepsy is not the main feature (e.g. <b>Angelman</b> <b>syndrome)</b> were categorized symptomatic but it was argued to include these within the category idiopathic. Classification of epilepsies and particularly of epilepsy syndromes will change with advances in research.|$|E

25|$|Congenital {{genetic disease}} is well {{understood}} {{and it is}} clear that epigenetics can play a role, for example, in the case of <b>Angelman</b> <b>syndrome</b> and Prader-Willi syndrome. These are normal genetic diseases caused by gene deletions or inactivation of the genes, but are unusually common because individuals are essentially hemizygous because of genomic imprinting, and therefore a single gene knock out is sufficient to cause the disease, where most cases would require both copies to be knocked out.|$|E
25|$|Some human {{disorders}} {{are associated with}} genomic imprinting, a phenomenon in mammals where the father and mother contribute different epigenetic patterns for specific genomic loci in their germ cells. The best-known case of imprinting in human disorders is that of <b>Angelman</b> <b>syndrome</b> and Prader-Willi syndrome—both can be produced by the same genetic mutation, chromosome 15q partial deletion, and the particular syndrome that will develop depends on whether the mutation is inherited from the child's mother or from their father. This {{is due to the}} presence of genomic imprinting in the region. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is also associated with genomic imprinting, often caused by abnormalities in maternal genomic imprinting of a region on chromosome 11.|$|E

40|$|Beckwith-Wiedemann {{syndrome}} (BWS), {{which causes}} prenatal overgrowth, midline abdominal wall defects, macroglossia, and embryonal tumors, {{is a model}} for understanding the relationship between genomic imprinting, human development, and cancer. The causes are heterogeneous, involving multiple genes on 11 p 15 and including infrequent mutation of p 57 KIP 2 or loss of imprinting of either of two imprinted gene domains on 11 p 15 : LIT 1, which is near p 57 KIP 2, or H 19 /IGF 2. Unlike Prader-Willi and <b>Angelman</b> <b>syndromes,</b> no chromosomal deletions have yet been identified. Here we report a microdeletion including the entire LIT 1 gene, providing genetic confirmation {{of the importance of}} this gene region in BWS. When inherited maternally, the deletion causes BWS with silencing of p 57 KIP 2, indicating deletion of an element important for the regulation of p 57 KIP 2 expression.

50|$|Uniparental Disomy: UPD {{occurs when}} both {{copies of a}} gene or genomic region are {{inherited}} from the same parent. This is uniparental, in contrast to autozygous segments which are bi-parental.

Acquired UPD is quite common in both hematologic and solid tumors, and is reported to constitute 20 to 80% of the LOH seen in human tumors. Acquired UPD can serve as the 2nd hit in the Knudson Two Hit Hypothesis of Tumorigenesis, and thus can be the biological equivalent of a deletion. Because this type of lesion cannot be detected by arrayCGH, FISH, or conventional cytogenetics, SNP-based arrays are preferred for virtual karyotyping of tumors.|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} proportion of children (up to 7 % in the UK) present with pronounced language difficulties that cannot be explained by obvious causes like other neurological and medical conditions. A substantial genetic component is predicted to underlie such language problems.

2500|$|Amish {{populations have}} higher incidences of {{particular}} conditions, including dwarfism, <b>Angelman</b> <b>Syndrome,</b> and various metabolic disorders, {{as well as}} an unusual distribution of blood types. The Amish represent a collection of different demes or genetically closed communities. Although the Amish do not have higher rates of genetic disorders than the general population, since almost all Amish descend from about 200 18th-century founders, genetic disorders resulting from inbreeding exist in more isolated districts (an example of the founder effect). Some of these disorders are rare or unique, and are serious enough to increase the mortality rate among Amish children. The Amish are aware of the advantages of exogamy, but for religious reasons marry only within their communities. The majority of Amish accept these as [...] "Gottes Wille" [...] (God's will); they reject the use of preventive genetic tests prior to marriage and genetic testing of unborn children to discover genetic disorders. However, Amish are willing to participate in studies of genetic diseases. Their extensive family histories are useful to researchers investigating diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and macular degeneration.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Proximal {{chromosome}} 15 q is {{implicated in}} neurodevelopmental disorders including Prader-Willi and <b>Angelman</b> <b>syndromes,</b> autistic disorder and developmental abnormalities resulting from chromosomal deletions or duplications. A subset of genes {{in this region}} are subject to genomic imprinting, {{the expression of the}} gene from only one parental allele. Results We have now identified the NDNL 2 (also known as MAGE-G) gene within the 15 q autistic disorder susceptibility region and have mapped its murine homolog to the region of conserved synteny near necdin (Ndn) on mouse Chr 7. NDNL 2 /MAGE-G is a member of a large gene family that includes the X-linked MAGE cluster, MAGED 1 (NRAGE), MAGEL 2 and NDN, where the latter two genes are implicated in Prader-Willi syndrome. We have now determined that NDNL 2 /Ndnl 2 is widely expressed in mouse and human fetal and adult tissues, and that it is apparently not subject to genomic imprinting by the PWS/AS Imprinting Center. Conclusion Although NDNL 2 /MAGE-G in the broadly defined chromosome 15 autistic disorder susceptibility region, it {{is not likely to be}} pathogenic based on its wide expression pattern and lack of imprinted expression. </p...|$|R
40|$|Maternally derived {{duplication}} of the imprinted region of chromosome 15 q 11 -q 14 {{leads to a}} complex neurobehavioral phenotype that often includes autism, cognitive deficits, and seizures. Multiple repeat elements within the region mediate a variety of rearrangements, including interstitial duplications, interstitial triplications, and supernumerary isodicentric marker chromosomes, {{as well as the}} deletions that cause Prader-Willi and <b>Angelman</b> <b>syndromes.</b> To elucidate the molecular structure of these duplication chromosomes, we designed a high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) platform. The array contains 79 clones that form a gapped contig across the critical region on chromosome 15 q 11 -q 14 and 21 control clones from other autosomes and the sex chromosomes. We used this array to examine a set of 48 samples from patients with segmental aneuploidy of chromosome 15 q. Using the array, we were able to determine accurately the dosage, which ranged from 1 to 6 copies, and also to detect atypical and asymmetric rearrangements. In addition, the increased resolution of the array allowed us to position two previously reported breakpoints within the contig. These results indicate that array CGH is a powerful technique to study rearrangements of proximal chromosome 15 q...|$|R
40|$|Real-time {{quantitative}} polymerase {{chain reaction}} (qPCR) depends on precise temperature control of the sample during cycling. In the current study, we investigated how temperature variation in plate-based qPCR instruments influences qPCR results. Temperature variation was measured by amplicon melting analysis as a convenient means to assess well-to-well differences. Multiple technical replicates of several SYBR Green I-based qPCR assays allowed correlation of relative well temperature to quantification cycle. We found that inadequate template denaturation results in an inverse correlation and requires increasing the denaturation temperature, adding a DNA destabilizing agent, or pretreating with a restriction enzyme. In contrast, inadequate primer annealing results in a direct correlation and requires lowering the annealing temperature. Significant correlations were found in 18 of 25 assays. The critical nature of temperature-dependent effects was shown in a blinded study of 29 patients for the diagnosis of Prader-Willy and <b>Angelman</b> <b>syndromes,</b> where eight diagnoses were incorrect unless temperature-dependent effects were controlled. A method to detect temperature-dependent effects by pairwise comparisons of replicates in routine experiments is presented and applied. Systematic temperature errors in qPCR instruments can be recognized and their effects eliminated when high precision is required in quantitative genetic diagnostics and critical complementary DNA analyses...|$|R

There, the laboratory [...] bridged their growing involvement in animal models of cognitive disorders with clinical studies. Additionally, UCLA's large and highly collaborative neuroscience community was an ideal environment for the interdisciplinary studies that characterized work in the Silva laboratory. [...] The Silva laboratory became more involved in studying molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for cognitive deficits in genetic neurodevelopmental disorders. In the late nineties, cognitive deficits associated with this class of disorders {{were thought to be}} caused by genetic disruptions of brain development [...] Animal model studies of Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) in the Silva lab suggested that the learning and memory deficits associated with NF1 mutations are caused by changes in synaptic plasticity mechanisms in adults. Accordingly, a project led by Rui M. Costa in the Silva Lab demonstrated that the electrophysiological, and more importantly the behavioral deficits, caused by NF1 mutations could be reversed in adults by manipulations that corrected the molecular signaling deficits associated with these mutations. This discovery, and a series of later studies in many laboratories worldwide, have demonstrated the surprising efficacy of adult interventions in reversing cognitive phenotypes in animal models of neurodevelopmental disorders. Following the NF1 studies published in 2002 by the Silva laboratory, other findings that reported adult rescue of neurodevelopment disorders include, for example, animal studies of Lhermitte-Duclos disease [...] and Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome in 2003, Fragile X syndrome in 2005, Down syndrome in 2007, Rett syndrome [...] and <b>Angelman</b> <b>syndrome</b> in 2007, Tuberous Sclerosis in 2008.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Cerebral Folate Deficiency (CFD) is {{a severe}} neurometabolic {{encephalopathy}} associated with {{low levels of}} 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate (5 MTHF) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and normal systemic folate metabolism. We report on a new clinical variant of CFD. Case report: A 6 years old male with intellectual disability, hypotonia, acquired microcephaly and without epilepsy and autistic features came to our attention because of severe recurrent self-injuring behaviors (SIBs) (hitting his head by hands or feet with a rapid, stereotyped, compulsive limb movements), which were triggered by selective environmental changes or frustrating novelties. MRI was normal. He had a low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate (5 MTHF), increased CSF biopterin and normal values of peripheral blood folate. Mutations in Folate receptor 1 gene and the production of folate receptor blocking/binding autoantibodies were excluded. MTHFR gene sequencing and DHPR enzyme activity were normal. Lesch Nyhann, Rett and <b>Angelman</b> <b>syndromes</b> were excluded. Folate supplementation restored almost completely CSF folate without influencing either biopterin and biogenic amine concentrations or SIBs. Conclusions: Developmental delay, mental disability, acquired microcephaly, severe SIBs and undetectable 5 MTHF in CSF with remarkable increase of biopterin are all hallmarks of this new condition associated to CFD.

40|$|Background: Genomic {{imprinting}} is {{an exception}} to Mendelian genetics in that imprinted genes are expressed monoallelically, dependent on parental origin. In mammals, imprinted genes are critical in numerous developmental and physiological processes. Aberrant imprinted gene expression is implicated in several diseases including Prader-Willi/ <b>Angelman</b> <b>syndromes</b> and cancer. Methodology/Principal Findings: To identify novel imprinted genes, transcription profiling was performed on two uniparentally derived cell lines, androgenetic and parthenogenetic primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts. A maternally expressed transcript termed Imprinted RNA near Meg 3 /Gtl 2 (Irm) was identified and its expression studied by Northern blotting and whole mounts in situ hybridization. The imprinted region that contains Irm has a parent of origin effect in three mammalian species, including the sheep callipyge locus. In mice and humans, both maternal and paternal uniparental disomies (UPD) cause embryonic growth and musculoskeletal abnormalities, indicating that both alleles likely express essential genes. To catalog all imprinted genes in this chromosomal region, twenty-five mouse mRNAs in a 1. 96 Mb span were investigated for allele specific expression. Conclusions/Significance: Ten imprinted genes were elucidated. The imprinting of three paternally expressed protein coding genes (Dlk 1, Peg 11, and Dio 3) was confirmed.
