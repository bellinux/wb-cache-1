60|$|I am {{of opinion}} that the Americans will show no unwillingness to pay the amount of {{taxation}} which must be exacted from them; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> that as regards their actual means {{they will have the}} power to pay it. But as regards their power of obtaining access to those means, I must confess that I see many difficulties in their way. In the first place they have no financier, no man who by natural aptitude and by long-continued contact with great questions of finance, has enabled himself to handle the money affairs of a nation with a master's hand. In saying this I do not intend to impute any blame to Mr. Chase, the present Secretary of the Treasury. Of his ability to do the work properly had he received the proper training, I am not able to judge. It is not that Mr. Chase is incapable. He may be capable or incapable. But it is that he has not had the education of a national financier, and that he has no one at his elbow to help him who has had that advantage.|$|E

40|$|It {{is argued}} that Wallace Chafes {{approach}} of relating studies of mind and consciousness to studies of real spoken language interaction is precisely what is needed in linguistics and psycholinguistics. However, the way Chafe attempts to establish the link between spoken language and consciousness is, in several respects, in need of clarification. The paper critically examines several of Chafes claims and points to areas, e. g. the notions of consciousness, intonation unit and new idea, where clarification or possible revision is needed. 1. Introduction First, I would like to agree with Chafe on the importance for both linguists and psychologists of more deeply considering the relationship between mind, consciousness <b>and</b> language. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> Chafe is right in claiming that this is most fruitfully accomplished by studying how mind and consciousness relate to real spoken language data where no parts have been edited out.

5000|$|The Serbs {{began at}} a certain point to take girls and young women out of the group of refugees. They were raped. The rapes often took place under the eyes of others and {{sometimes}} even under the eyes of the children of the mother. A Dutch soldier stood by and he simply looked around with a Walkman on his head. He did not react at all to what was happening. It did not happen just before my eyes, for I saw that personally, but also before the eyes of us all. The Dutch soldiers walked around everywhere. It is impossible that they did not see it.There was a woman with a small baby a few months old. A Chetnik told the mother that the child must stop crying. When the child did not stop crying, he snatched the child away and cut its throat. Then he laughed. There was a Dutch soldier there who was watching. He did not react at all.I saw yet more frightful things. For example, there was a girl, she must have been about nine years old. At a certain moment some Chetniks recommended to her brother that he rape the girl. He did not do it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> that he could not have done it for he was still just a child. Then they murdered that young boy. I have personally seen all that.

5000|$|... “This is one {{relationship}} that's as refreshingly honest as {{they come}} with characters as real and sweet as their portrayers." [...] — Soap Opera Magazine in 1998, on the popularity of Lucky and Liz. Lucky and Elizabeth first made a supercouple name for themselves during the storyline of Elizabeth's rape in 1998. The young couple was compared to the romance of Lucky's parents Luke and Laura, notorious supercouple of the 1980s. As a result, they are commonly referred to by the portmanteau [...] "L&L" [...] or [...] "L&L2" [...] on internet message boards. Similar to the nuances of other supercouples, Lucky always calls Liz by a certain name, a popular detail to fans. Jackson explained to Soap Opera Magazine {{that it was his}} idea: [...] "I just made a decision that I wanted to call her Elizabeth. I don't know why. I really like the name. I think it's beautiful - <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> she has a different relationship with him. Everyone else may call her Liz, but to him she's Elizabeth." [...] As the on-screen couple took the start of their relationship slow, their popularity with fans grew quickly. The gradual timing of the relationship was one reason for the popularity, as viewers watched them blossom from friends to something more. The slow progression made viewers feel the relationship was honest and innocent, something unique among soap opera couples at the time. Jackson described in a 1999 interview, “What's been portrayed is what people want to see. A kind of pure romance and pure love." [...] Herbst commented to Soap Opera Digest in 1998: [...] "I {{think one of the reasons}} why people like them so much is because their relationship is so healthy. (...) Individually they have their own issues and problems that they need to work out. But I think people like seeing that - they like seeing them work out their problems together." [...] Elizabeth and Lucky first grow close as friends, while Lucky helps Liz deal with her rape and Liz helps Lucky deal with his family issues. Another factor in the couple's rise to supercouple status was the chemistry between original portrayers of the couple, Herbst and Jackson. Their chemistry grew as they bonded during Elizabeth's rape. Herbst explained in a 1998 interview:The slow progression of the couple's physical relationship was another reason for its success. Each character dealing with personal issues, the couple’s first kiss happened months into the relationship, and was much anticipated and celebrated by fans. The gradual pacing continued when the couple decided to wait to have sex, shortly before Lucky is presumed dead in April 1999 and off-screen for close to a year. Herbst and Jackson’s popularity continued after his departure; that July they were still voted number one actor, actress and couple by fans of Soaps In Depth.|$|E
