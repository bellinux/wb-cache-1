5|$|Mellor's {{works have}} been {{included}} in the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award on several occasions, in 2000, 2001, and every year from 2003 to 2010. In 2003, his mezzotint print Cyathea cooperi, portraying tree ferns native to the Queensland rainforest, was highly commended. Subsequent entries have included Of fragile dreams the heart which nevermore in 2005, Untitled (Ernie Grant in Blackman Street) in 2006, Exotic lies and sacred ties (the heart that conceals, the tongue that never reveals) in 2008, and <b>A</b> <b>Transcendent</b> Vision (of life, death and resurrection) in 2010. Reviewing the 2008 exhibition, academic Sarah Scott expressed surprise that Mellor's 2008 piece had neither attracted an award nor been purchased for the Northern Territory's public collection.|$|E

25|$|In brief: Philo affirms <b>a</b> <b>transcendent</b> God without {{physical}} features or emotional qualities resembling those of human beings. In Philo, God exists beyond {{time and space}} and does not make special interventions into the world because He already encompasses the entire cosmos.|$|E
25|$|Vasubandhu {{gives an}} {{analysis}} of the workings of the human mind and consciousness, based on the analysis of the working of the five skandhas. Vasubandhu's original analysis leaves ample room for the proposition of <b>a</b> <b>transcendent</b> essence, but was interpreted in an idealist way by later followers.|$|E
5000|$|Neoplatonism is monistic. Plotinus {{taught that}} there was <b>an</b> ineffable <b>transcendent</b> god, 'The One,' of which {{subsequent}} realities were emanations. From The One emanates the Divine Mind (Nous), the Cosmic Soul (Psyche), and the World (Cosmos).|$|R

25|$|Many Greek people {{recognized}} the major gods and goddesses: Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Apollo, Artemis, Aphrodite, Ares, Dionysus, Hephaestus, Athena, Hermes, Demeter, Hestia and Hera; though philosophies such as Stoicism and {{some forms of}} Platonism used language that seems to posit <b>a</b> <b>transcendent</b> single deity. Different cities often worshipped the same deities, sometimes with epithets that distinguished them and specified their local nature.|$|E
25|$|The romantic idea of {{enlightenment}} as insight into a timeless, transcendent reality has been popularized especially by D.T. Suzuki. Further popularization {{was due to}} the writings of Heinrich Dumoulin. Dumoulin viewed metaphysics as the expression of <b>a</b> <b>transcendent</b> truth, which according to him was expressed by Mahayana Buddhism, but not by the pragmatic analysis of the oldest Buddhism, which emphasizes anatta. This romantic vision is also recognizable in the works of Ken Wilber.|$|E
25|$|Passion {{is closely}} aligned with faith in Kierkegaard's thought. Faith as a passion is what drives humans to seek reality and truth in <b>a</b> <b>transcendent</b> world, even though {{everything}} we can know intellectually speaks against it. To live and die for a belief, to stake everything one has {{and is in the}} belief in something that has a higher meaning than anything in the world—this is belief and passion at their highest.|$|E
40|$|This work {{discusses}} the so-called ‘Eleatic’ {{argument against the}} existence of transcendent universals, i. e. universals which does not require instantiation for its existence. The Eleatic Principle states that everything produces {{a difference in the}} causal powers of something. <b>As</b> <b>transcendent</b> universals seem not to produce such <b>a</b> difference, <b>transcendent</b> universals seem not to exist. The argument depends crucially on the justification and the interpretation of the Eleatic Principle. It is argued, first, that it is not very clear that the principle is justified, and, second, that there are several alternatives for its interpretation, in relation with the different theories one can endorse about modality or causality. Anti-realist theories of modality or causality are not very appropriate for the understanding of what should be a ‘causal power’. Neither does a realist theory of causality conjoined with a combinatorial theory of possible worlds. A ‘causal power’ seems to be better understood in connection with a realist –non-reductionist– theory of causality and a causal theory of modality. Taken in this way the Eleatic Principle, nonetheless, it is argued that transcendent universals do ‘produce’ a difference in causal powers, for every causal connection requires such universals for its existence...|$|R

25|$|The stone work of {{the two-story}} {{platform}} exhibits a superb sense of architectural organization and advanced building methods. Two stone pagodas {{stand in front of}} the main hall of the temple. The simpler Seokgatap located to the left of the court represents Buddha's manifestation in <b>a</b> <b>transcendent</b> calm. It has three stories with two pedestal layers and a total height reaching about twenty-five feet. The pagoda consists of simple undecorated pedestal slabs and three-story stupa each of which has five stepped eaves and truncated roofs. These characteristics constitute a typical form of the Korean stone pagodas.|$|E
25|$|Although Theravada {{does not}} {{acknowledge}} {{the existence of}} a theistic Absolute, it does postulate Nirvana as <b>a</b> <b>transcendent</b> reality which may be attained. It further stresses transformation of the personality through meditative practice, self-restraint, and morally just behaviour. According to Richard H. Jones, Theravada is a form of mindful extrovertive and introvertive mysticism, in which the conceptual structuring of experiences is weakened, and the ordinary sense of self is weakened. It is best known in the west from the Vipassana movement, a number of branches of modern Theravāda Buddhism from Burma, Laos, Thailand and Sri Lanka, and includes contemporary American Buddhist teachers such as Joseph Goldstein and Jack Kornfield.|$|E
25|$|Musical {{expression}} {{is the art}} of playing or singing music with emotional communication. The elements of music that comprise expression include dynamic indications, such as forte or piano, phrasing, differing qualities of timbre and articulation, color, intensity, energy and excitement. All of these devices can be incorporated by the performer. A performer aims to elicit responses of sympathetic feeling in the audience, and to excite, calm or otherwise sway the audience's physical and emotional responses. Musical {{expression is}} sometimes thought to be produced by a combination of other parameters, and sometimes described as <b>a</b> <b>transcendent</b> quality that is {{more than the sum of}} measurable quantities such as pitch or duration.|$|E
5000|$|... "The One" [...] (Τὸ Ἕν) is {{a concept}} that is {{prominent}} in the writings of the Neoplatonists, especially those of the philosopher Plotinus. In the writings of Plotinus, [...] "The One" [...] is described as <b>an</b> inconceivable, <b>transcendent,</b> all-embodying, permanent, eternal, causative entity that permeates throughout all of existence.|$|R

Fred Smith's solid bass playing allowed for <b>a</b> more <b>transcendent</b> and profound music from the two guitarists and drummer, resulting in their being signed to Elektra Records in 1977.|$|R
5000|$|In Judaism, God is an {{absolute}} one, indivisible and incomparable being who is the ultimate cause of all existence. In Hinduism, gods are considered to have a similar status to another when distinct, but may {{also be seen as}} [...] "aspects or manifestations of <b>a</b> single, <b>transcendent</b> god", or <b>an</b> [...] "impersonal absolute".|$|R
25|$|The {{art of the}} {{northern}} route was also highly influenced {{by the development of}} Mahāyāna Buddhism, an inclusive branch of Buddhism characterized by the adoption of new texts, in addition to the traditional āgamas, and a shift in the understanding of Buddhism. Mahāyāna goes beyond the traditional Early Buddhist ideal of the release from suffering (duḥkha) of arhats, and emphasizes the bodhisattva path. The Mahāyāna sutras elevate the Buddha to <b>a</b> <b>transcendent</b> and infinite being, and feature a pantheon of bodhisattvas devoting themselves to the Six Perfections, ultimate knowledge (Prajñāpāramitā), enlightenment, and the liberation of all sentient beings. Northern Buddhist art thus tends to be characterized by a very rich and syncretic Buddhist pantheon, with a multitude of images of the various buddhas, bodhisattvas, and heavenly beings (devas).|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 18th century, Shakespeare was {{described}} as <b>a</b> <b>transcendent</b> genius and {{by the beginning of}} the 19th century Bardolatry was in full swing. Uneasiness about the difference between Shakespeare's godlike reputation and the humdrum facts of his biography continued to emerge in the 19th century. In 1853, with help from Ralph Waldo Emerson, Delia Bacon, an American teacher and writer, travelled to Britain to research her belief that Shakespeare's works were written by a group of dissatisfied politicians, in order to communicate the advanced political and philosophical ideas of Francis Bacon (no relation). Later writers such as Ignatius Donnelly portrayed Francis Bacon as the sole author. After being proposed by James Greenstreet in 1891, it was the advocacy of Professor Abel Lefranc, a renowned authority on Renaissance literature, which in 1918 put William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby in a prominent position as a candidate.|$|E
25|$|For all this, {{the subject}} of the South American Congress held in 1958 in Rio de Janeiro was not unknown to board members: Raúl Colombo and Eduardo Palma of Argentina, Fermín Sorhueta, Washington Cataldi, Luis Tróccoli and Juan Carlos Bracco of Uruguay, doctor Alfredo Gallindo of Bolivia, Lydio Quevedo of Paraguay, Teófilo Salinas of Perú, Alberto Goñi of Chile, and Joao Havelange and Abilio D'Almeida of Brazil. The {{secretary}} general of the Union des Associations Européennes de Football, or UEFA, Henry Delaunay, submitted a proposal to the then-head of CONMEBOL José Ramos de Freitas of Brazil to organize an annual double confrontation between the champions of Europe and South America in what was seen as a welcomed but unneeded incentive. The proposal {{for the creation of a}} South American club championship was supported by Argentina and Brazil but was opposed by Uruguay, a country which at that time still had <b>a</b> <b>transcendent</b> pre-eminence in the decision-making of the confederation, sharing political and continental power with Argentina. Brazil had just won their first World Cup and had not yet the privileges or political weight that presently holds.|$|E
50|$|A creator deity or creator god (often {{called the}} Creator) is a deity or god {{responsible}} {{for the creation of}} the Earth, world, and universe. In monotheism, the single God is often also the creator. A number of monolatristic traditions separate a secondary creator from <b>a</b> primary <b>transcendent</b> being, identified as a primary creator.|$|R
5000|$|A shout or ring shout is <b>an</b> ecstatic, <b>transcendent</b> {{religious}} ritual, first {{practiced by}} African {{slaves in the}} West Indies and the United States, in which worshipers move in a circle while shuffling and stomping their feet and clapping their hands.

500|$|In other words, the {{welcoming}} of the Other, to Levinas, {{was the very}} essence of conscience properly conceived; it encouraged our ego to accept the fallibility of assuming things about other people, that selfish freedom of will [...] "does not have the last word" [...] and that realising this has <b>a</b> <b>transcendent</b> purpose: [...] "I am not alone... in conscience I have an experience that is not commensurate with any a priori [...] framework-a conceptless experience." ...|$|E
