5|$|The late stelae at Seibal show {{a marked}} {{reduction}} in quality over <b>a</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> about forty years, {{with the loss}} of Classic Period traits, and bearing flatter and cruder representations than earlier stelae.

5|$|A {{signature}} {{feature of}} Parthian architecture was the iwan, an audience hall supported by arches or barrel vaults and open on one side. Use {{of the barrel}} vault replaced the Hellenic use of columns to support roofs. Although the iwan was known during the Achaemenid period and earlier in smaller and subterranean structures, it was the Parthians who first built them on a monumental scale. The earliest Parthian iwans are found at Seleucia, built in the early 1st century AD. Monumental iwans are also commonly found in the ancient temples of Hatra and perhaps modeled on the Parthian style. The largest Parthian iwans at that site have <b>a</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> 15m (50ft).|$|E

5|$|According to the {{accounts}} {{of some of the}} guards, there may have been an opportunity for {{one or more of the}} guards to rescue a survivor.

5|$|After the eruption, Glicken went to Toutle High School, {{the center}} for relief efforts, where he joined Air Force Reserve Rescue Squadron {{officials}} in a helicopter to look for Johnston or any sign of his post.

He attempted to enlist a fourth helicopter crew to aid his search, but they declined, fearing dangerous conditions.

Their trips were made without the benefit of modern lightweight equipment, freeze-dried foods, sunblock, or radios.

The couple shared and alternated responsibilities; one year Fanny would organize the logistics of their journey and William would work on the scientific projects and the next year they would reverse roles.|$|E

5|$|Chord {{inversion}} {{is especially}} simple in major-thirds tuning. Chords are inverted simply by raising {{one or two}} notes three strings.

In contrast, inversions of chords in standard tuning require three fingers on <b>a</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> four frets, in standard tuning, the shape of inversions depends on the involvement of the irregular major-third.|$|E

5|$|Krrish was {{the first}} Indian film to be shot in Singapore under the Singapore Tourism Board's Film-in-Singapore subsidy scheme, and more than 60% of the film was shot there.

Locations featured included the Singapore Zoo, the Gateway building, and the Singapore National Library. Another major filming location was Robinson Road, where heavy rains caused production delays. The Singapore police were on location to block roads and protect the filming equipment, such as when the film's action scenes required two 250-foot high industrial cranes. Author Audrey Yue noted that the film shoot benefited Singapore by leading to domestic and Indian film-induced tourism.|$|E
40|$|We propose and {{demonstrate}} a multiplexing method for ultrasonic sensors based on fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) that are included inside the laser cavity of a fiber-ring laser. The multiplexing is achieved using add-drop filters to route the light signals, {{according to their}} wavelengths, into different optical paths, each of which contains <b>a</b> separate <b>span</b> <b>of</b> erbium-doped fiber (EDF) as the gain medium. Because <b>a</b> specific <b>span</b> <b>of</b> EDF only addresses a single wavelength channel, mode completion is avoided and the FBG ultrasonic sensors can be simultaneously demodulated. The proposed method is experimentally demonstrated using a two-channel system with two sensing FBGs in <b>a</b> single <b>span</b> <b>of</b> fiber...|$|R
