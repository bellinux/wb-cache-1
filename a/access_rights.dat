5|$|Inmates were {{permitted}} {{out into the}} yard on Saturdays and Sundays and on holidays for a maximum of 5 hours. Inmates who worked seven days a week in the kitchen were rewarded with short yard breaks during the weekdays. Badly behaved prisoners were liable to having their yard <b>access</b> <b>rights</b> taken away from them on weekends. The prisoners of Alcatraz {{were permitted}} to play games such as baseball, softball and other sports at these times and intellectual games such as chess. Because of the small size of the yard and the diamond at the end of it, a section of the wall behind the first base had to be padded to cushion the impact of inmates overrunning it. Inmates were provided gloves, bats, and balls, but no sport uniforms. In 1938, there were four amateur teams, the Bees, Oaks, Oilers, and Seals, named after Minor League clubs, and four league teams named after Major League clubs, the Cardinals, Cubs, Giants, and Tigers. Many of the inmates used weekends in the yards to converse with each other and discuss crime, the only real opportunities they had during the week for a durable conversation.|$|E

25|$|Comprehensiveness {{can refer}} {{to the number of}} entries in a database. On those terms, a crystal {{structure}} database can be regarded as comprehensive, if it contains a collection of all (re-)published crystal structures in the category of interest and is updated frequently. Searching for structures in such a database can replace more time-consuming scanning of the open literature. Access to crystal structure databases differs widely. It can be divided into reading and writing access. Reading <b>access</b> <b>rights</b> (search, download) affect the number and range of users. Restricted reading access is often coupled with restricted usage rights. Writing <b>access</b> <b>rights</b> (upload, edit, delete), on the other hand, determine the number and range of contributors to the database.

25|$|National Express East Coast {{requested}} {{additional services}} {{to a number}} of destinations in its application for <b>access</b> <b>rights</b> on the East Coast Main Line (ECML) in March 2008, stating that, in addition to its existing InterCity 125 and InterCity 225 sets, it would require as many as nine Class 180 units. The routes proposed were London to Lincoln (with one train per day extended to Cleethorpes) and London to Harrogate via York. Although NXEC no longer exists, its successor East Coast pressed ahead with the plans, and managed to secure five units, three of which were temporarily sub-leased to Northern (see above). However, it recently announced that, due to government cuts, it would no longer be introducing a regular all-day service to and from Lincoln.|$|E
25|$|Whitchurch–Stouffville is {{also home}} to a number of kettle lakes which are ideal for outdoor water recreation. While these glacier-formed lakes are crown property, and the {{resources}} of all levels of government are used for their regulation, protection and preservation, the actual perimeter of the lakes are in private hands (kettle lakes are not fed by creeks or rivers) and therefore only homeowners in the sub-communities have <b>access</b> <b>rights</b> to Whitchurch–Stouffville's lakes. Access to Musselman's Lake via Cedar Beach Trailer Park was lost in 2012, while access to Preston Lake was lost when Landford Development purchased the west-shore beach and trailer park and built estate properties with a shared private beach. In 2008 the town's development plans included a trail system with access to Preston Lake, but this was met with opposition from Preston Lake residents who desired to protect their exclusive access. Interest and support for the purchase or expropriation of land for public access to the town's most important natural and recreational assests has grown with the town's development.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} change {{was made in}} {{preparation}} for the North Freeway connection, when the directions of Calhoun Avenue and Jefferson Street were swapped so that they would alternate. A bridge, dated 1954, was built to carry traffic from Jefferson Street over traffic to Jefferson Street, and US 75 was moved to Calhoun Avenue northbound, soon crossing downtown on the one-way pair of Calhoun Avenue and Pierce Street to the new North Freeway. A median barrier was added in 1956 to prevent crossover accidents. Southeast of downtown Houston, the at-grade intersections proved dangerous, and only two had been replaced with interchanges by 1959, when the Texas Highway Department began a program to upgrade the road to full freeway standards. Frontage roads would be required along the entire highway, since the state had not purchased <b>access</b> <b>rights,</b> and so abutting property owners were able to build driveways to the road. To accomplish this, traffic was shifted to the newly built frontage roads so that the central main lanes could be reconstructed. This grade separation was completed from Houston to Almeda-Genoa Road (exit 34) in June 1959, Farm to Market Road 1959 (exit 30) in October 1964, Farm to Market Road 518 (exit 23) in December 1970, and Farm to Market Road 1764 (exit 15) in 1976. As the section beyond FM 1764 into Galveston had already been rebuilt, this marked the completion of the Gulf Freeway as an actual freeway.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} memory {{addressing}} environments {{that support the}} notion of a single address space. We consider the problem of hampering access attempts to the private objects of a given thread, when these attempts are generated by unauthorized threads of different processes. We introduce two different forms of access privilege representation - handles and gates - which are designed to coexist within the boundaries of the same protection system. The handle concept is a generalization of the classical protected pointer concept. A handle associates several keys (passwords) with an object name. Each key grants a specific <b>access</b> <b>right</b> to the named object. A gate is a compact representation of access privileges, which uses a single bit to encode an <b>access</b> <b>right.</b> Handles are protected from forgery by key sparseness. They can be freely mixed in memory with ordinary data. On the other hand, gates are sensitive data that must be kept segregated in private memory regions of the protection system. The dualism of handles and gates makes it possible {{to take advantage of the}} simplicity of <b>access</b> <b>right</b> distribution and object sharing between threads, which is characteristic of key-based protection systems, and to avoid the negative impact on overall system performance, which results from the large key size and the high costs of lengthy processing that are connected with key validation...|$|R

It has further increased the need for online security and authentication for secure information exchange. In an internet environment, such as UNIX, a remote user has to obtain the <b>access</b> <b>right</b> from a server before doing any job. The procedure of obtaining <b>access</b> <b>right</b> is called a user authentication protocol. Password Authentication Protocols (PAP), smart cards, digital signatures, hand impressions are some of the solutions proposed, but the easiest and the most feasible solution on the network are the Password Authentication Protocols. It can be easily implemented and provides us with simple, efficient and a secure authentication mechanism. Several password authentication protocols have been introduced each claiming to withstand to the several attacks, including replay, password file compromise, denial of service, etc. The different password authentication protocols ar...|$|R

Thanks to the wide distribution of cell phones, an expanding digital infrastructure, and a growing appetite for music entertainment, India has become an important digital music export market for the United States.
