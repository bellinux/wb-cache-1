500|$|The {{challenge}} of coordinating these projects took an artistic toll on Pei. He found himself responsible for acquiring new building contracts and supervising {{the plans for}} them. As a result, he felt disconnected from the actual creative work. [...] "Design is {{something you have to}} put your hand to," [...] he said. [...] "While my people had the luxury of doing one job at <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> had {{to keep track of the}} whole enterprise." [...] Pei's dissatisfaction reached its peak at a time when financial problems began plaguing Zeckendorf's firm. I.M. Pei and Associates officially broke from Webb and Knapp in 1960, which benefited Pei creatively but pained him personally. He had developed a close friendship with Zeckendorf, and both men were sad to part ways.|$|E

Examples of his acoustic guitar playing on Beatles tracks include [...] "Yesterday", [...] "I'm Looking Through You", [...] "Michelle", [...] "Blackbird", [...] "I Will", [...] "Mother Nature's Son" [...] and [...] "Rocky Raccoon". McCartney singled out [...] "Blackbird" [...] {{as a personal}} favourite and described his technique for the guitar part in the following way: [...] "I got my own little sort of cheating way of ... I'm actually sort of pulling two strings at <b>a</b> <b>time...</b> <b>I</b> was trying to emulate those folk players." [...] He employed a similar technique for [...] "Jenny Wren". He played an Epiphone Texan on many of his acoustic recordings, but also used a Martin D-28.|$|E

500|$|Around {{the time}} he began {{recording}} his final album, Smith began to display signs of paranoia, often believing that a white van followed him wherever he went. He would have friends drop him off for recording sessions almost a mile away from the studio, and to reach the location, he would trudge through hundreds of yards of brush and cliffs. He started telling people that DreamWorks was out to get him: [...] "Not long ago my house was broken into, and songs were stolen off my computer which have {{wound up in the}} hands of certain people who work at a certain label. I've also been followed around for months at <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't even want to necessarily say it's the people from that label who are following me around, but it was probably them who broke into my house." [...] During this period, Smith hardly ate, subsisting primarily on ice cream. He would go without sleeping for several days and then sleep for an entire day.|$|E

2500|$|There is a {{specific}} Classical influence in Chrétien's romances {{the likes of which}} (The Iliad, The Aeneid, Metamorphoses) were [...] "translated into the Old French vernacular during the 1150s". Foster Guyer argues that specifically Yvain, the Knight of the Lion contains definite Ovidian influence: [...] "Yvain was filled with grief and showed the Ovidian love symptoms of weeping and sighing so bitterly that he could scarcely speak. He declared that he would never stay away a full year. [...] Using words like those of Leander in the seventeenth of Ovid's Epistles he said: 'If only I had the wings of a dove/to fly back to you at will/Many and many <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> would come'." ...|$|E

My {{thinking}} is that if I focus on one song at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> would approach them as beautiful, distinct paintings that would each require the attention they deserve. This would also mean I would choose what I am recording quite carefully as there would be tremendous internal pressure to get it just right, and {{that is the kind of}} pressure I like, which is to make the most beautiful thing possible.|$|E
2500|$|Winchester was {{respected}} by the others professionally, {{but at the}} same time, as a Boston blue blood, he was also snobbish, as when he stated in the scrub room, [...] "I do one thing at <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> do it very well, and then I move on," [...] which drove much of his conflict with the other characters. Still, the show's writers occasionally allowed Winchester's humanity to shine through, such as in his dealings with a young concert pianist who had partially lost the use of his right hand, the protection of a stuttering soldier from the bullying of other soldiers (it is revealed later that Winchester's sister Honoria stutters), his keeping a vigil with Hawkeye when Hawkeye's father went into surgery back in the States ("Sons and Bowlers"), his willingness to be officer of the day for Hawkeye when Hawkeye was offered three days in Seoul, giving blood to a patient even though he already donated blood five days earlier, or his continuing a family tradition of anonymously giving Christmas treats to an orphanage. Winchester subjects himself to condemnation after realizing that [...] "it is sadly inappropriate to offer dessert to a child who has had no meal." [...] Isolating himself, he is saved by Klinger's own gift of understanding. Klinger scrapes together a Christmas dinner for Charles, with the provision that the source of the gift remain anonymous (Klinger had overheard Winchester's argument with the manager of the orphanage). For the final moment of the episode ("Death Takes a Holiday"), the two are simply friends as Charles says, [...] "Thank you, Max," [...] and Klinger replies, [...] "Merry Christmas, Charles." [...] As well, in the series finale [...] "Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen", Charles comes across a group of Chinese musicians who surrender to him. When Charles takes them back to the camp as prisoners of war and later listens to his record of Mozart's [...] Quintet in A major for Clarinet and Strings, K. 581, the musicians attempt to play the piece of music. Charles, ever the perfectionist, cannot stand to hear them play the piece incorrectly (and is impressed that they can even attempt to play the music after only hearing it once) and spends the next week conducting them on how to play the piece properly. During this time, Charles is forced to use the little patience that he rarely shows. When the Chinese musicians are taken off to a prisoner of war camp in a prisoner exchange to Charles' dismay and protest, their final goodbye to Charles is the Mozart piece played correctly. Later, one of the musicians returns to the camp mortally wounded on a Jeep. When Charles inquires as to where the other musicians are, it's revealed that the truck the musicians were on was ambushed and that there were no other survivors. In a combination of shock and disbelief, Charles returns to The Swamp to listen to the Mozart record, but removes the record and smashes it in anger. Later still on the final night that everyone at the M*A*S*H is together, Charles says that before the war, music was a stress reliever to him, but because of the Chinese musicians and their fate, music will forever be a reminder of the horrors of war.|$|E
