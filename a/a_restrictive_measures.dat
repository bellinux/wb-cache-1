40|$|This paper {{examines}} the empirical implications of aggregation bias when measuring the productive impact of computers. To isolate two specific aggregation problems relating to "aggregation in variables" and "aggregation in relations," we compare various production function estimates across {{a range of}} specifications, econometric estimators, and data levels. The results show that both sources of bias are important, especially as one moves from the sector to the economy level, and when the elasticity of all types of non-computer capital are incorrectly restricted to be equal. In terms of computers, however, the estimated elasticity is surprisingly stable between industry and sector regressions and {{does not appear to be}} biased by the incorporation of <b>a</b> <b>restrictive</b> <b>measure</b> of non-computer capital.

The state authorities have the negative obligation to restrain from any arbitrary or excessive requirement that may restrict or condition the exercise of the constitutional right. In order to be legitimate and constitutional, any restriction of the exercise of the fundamental rights and liberties through the measures prescribed by the state’s authorities, needs to have the character of exemption, not to affect the substance of the law and to fulfill all conditions stipulated by article 53 of Constitution. In relation to these premises we analyze in this study the constitutional institution of restraining some rights’ exercising and the relevant aspects of jurisprudence. The observance of the principle of proportionality is one of the constitutional requirements in order that such <b>a</b> <b>restrictive</b> <b>measure</b> be legitimate. The main particularities of the principle of proportionality applied in the matter of restraining some rights’ exercising are analyzed with reference to the jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human’s Rights...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{consensus}} {{that the effects of}} medical brain drain, especially in the Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, ought to be perceived as more than a simple misfortune. Temporary restrictions on the emigration of health workers from the region is one of the already existing policy measures to tackle the issue - while such <b>a</b> <b>restrictive</b> <b>measure</b> brings about the need for quite a justificatory work. A recent normative contribution to the debate by Gillian Brock provides a fruitful starting point. In the first step of her defence of emigration restrictions, Brock provides three reasons why skilled workers themselves would hold responsibilities to assist with respect to vital needs of their compatriots. These are fair reciprocity, duty to support vital institutions, and attending to the unintended harmful consequences of one's actions. While the first two are explained and also largely discussed in the literature, the third requires an explication on how and on which basis skilled workers would have a responsibility as such. In this article, I offer a vulnerability approach with its dependency aspect that may account for why the health workers in underserved contexts would have a responsibility to attend to the unintended side effects of their actions that may lead to a vital risk of harm for the population. I discuss HIV/AIDS care in Zimbabwe as a case in point in order to show that local health workers may have responsibilities to assist the population who are vulnerable to their mobility...|$|R
40|$|With {{the global}} community's growing {{awareness}} of the need for environmental protection, a significant number of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) have been created. Some among them mandate or allow the parties to impose trade-restrictive measures for environmental purposes, such as for regulating international trade in environmentally harmful products and endangered species, for eliminating economic incentives that encourage environmentally destructive activities, or for ensuring member compliance with and encouraging non-member accession to the MEAs. However, when <b>a</b> trade <b>restrictive</b> <b>measure</b> under <b>a</b> certain MEA is imposed by one World Trade Organization (WTO) member against another, it raises a question about consistency with relevant WTO agreements, regardless of whether the targeted WTO member is a party to the MEA. So far, no specific case concerning WTO consistency of <b>a</b> trade <b>restrictive</b> <b>measure</b> under <b>an</b> MEA has been brought to the WTO dispute settlement proceedings. However, such a case is quite likely to occur in the future with the increasing usage of the kinds of measures mentioned above. Based on this concern, the "relationship between existing WTO rules and specific trade obligations set out in MEAs" has been included in the agenda for the Doha Round negotiations under the WTO (Doha Development Agenda). When such a case goes to the WTO dispute settlement proceedings, what status should be given to the MEA in question? Is it a valid scenario for WTO panels and the Appellate Body to give priority to a specific MEA over WTO agreements in accordance with the MEA's conflict of law rules or public international law, thereby confirming the WTO consistency of trade <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> under that MEA? Academics have discussed at length whether MEAs and other non-WTO international law can become the applicable law in the WTO dispute settlement proceedings. This paper considers this problem by comparing and analyzing in detail the arguments of Joost Pauwelyn (Duke University Faculty of Law), who affirmatively answers this problem and of Joel Trachtman (The Fletcher School, Tufts University) who answers negatively. From the perspective of supporting the coherence of international law, this paper concludes by siding with Pauwelyn's argument. ...|$|R

Method: We surveyed a nationally representative sample of Dutch care professionals. 195 staff members working in settings providing care for people with ID filled out the survey (response 68. 7 %). Results: If there is danger, physical aggression or sexually abusive behavior almost all (87. 8 – 96. 8 %) staff members consider the use of <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures.</b> The most often mentioned goals of <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> are averting or avoiding danger (90. 4 % and 83. 0 %).

We suggest and test an analytic model in which the predictors are ranked according to their conceptual proximity to attitudes. The data stem from a Web survey in the Norwegian adult population (N 1, 951), mapping the respondents’ attitudes toward pricing policy and availability restrictions, belief in the harm-limiting effect of such measures, belief in the harm caused by drinking, and personal experiences with harm from others’ drinking.

Stochastic Cobb-Douglas production functions for the sugar industry were estimated from which indices of physical capacity utilization rates were obtained.

The result of the regression further revealed that the sugar industry in Nigeria was demand unconstrained but resource constrained.

Increased support for <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> was partly mediated by changes in beliefs in terms of statistically significant indirect effects from both belief in the effectiveness of such measures and belief in the harm caused by drinking.
