50|$|The {{ecoregion}} {{is home to}} 276 bird species, none {{of which}} are endemic. Large threatened birds include the lesser florican (Eupodotis indica) and Indian bustard (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>nigriceps).</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are more}} than 400 species of birds in the region {{including}} the endemic rufous-vented prinia (Prinia burnesii), the near-endemic white-winged tit (Parus nuchalis) and the threatened great Indian bustard (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>nigriceps)</b> and lesser florican (Eupodotis indica).|$|R
50|$|Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary (established in 1979, {{also known}} as the Jawaharlal Nehru Bustard Sanctuary of Maharashtra) is a {{wildlife}} sanctuary for the great Indian bustard (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>nigriceps)</b> at Solapur, Maharashtra, India. The land is drought-prone and semi-arid. Its ecoregion is that of Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests.|$|R
50|$|The dry grasslands that predominate {{do provide}} habitat for the native fauna {{remaining}} scattered amid the thorn scrub. The grasslands of southern Andhra Pradesh support a good {{population of the}} great Indian bustard (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>nigriceps)</b> and blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra), although these and other species are declining in number.|$|R
25|$|Many {{types of}} birds are found {{throughout}} the basin, such as myna, Psittacula parakeets, crows, kites, partridges, and fowls. Ducks and snipes migrate across the Himalayas during the winter, attracted in large numbers to wetland areas. There are no endemic birds in the upper Gangetic Plain. The great Indian bustard (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>nigriceps)</b> and lesser florican (Sypheotides indicus) are considered globally threatened.|$|R
50|$|Of {{the twenty}} three {{species of the}} {{bustards}} found in the world, the magnificent, tall, long-necked great Indian bustard (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>nigriceps)</b> {{is the only one}} to have been recorded as endangered according to the 2009 IUCN Red List Category (as evaluated by Bird Life International - the official Red List Authority for birds for IUCN). This categorization is {{based on the fact that}} its population is on the decline as a result of hunting and continued agricultural development.|$|R
50|$|The {{ecoregion}} {{is home to}} 75 mammal species. Threatened species {{include the}} Indian elephant (Elephas maximus), wild dog (Cuon alpinus), sloth bear (Melursus ursinus), chousingha (Tetracerus quadricornis), gaur (Bos gaurus), and grizzled giant squirrel (Ratufa macruora). Salim Ali's fruit bat (Latidens salimalii) is critically endangered, and is near-endemic. 260 species of birds live in the eco-region, and two, the rufous babbler (Turdoides subrufus) and yellow-throated bulbul (Pycnonotus xantholaemus) are near-endemic. The threatened great Indian bustard (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>nigriceps)</b> and lesser florican (Eupodotis indica) inhabit the eco-region.|$|R

40|$|The Great Indian Bustard <b>Ardeotis</b> <b>nigriceps,</b> a {{threatened}} and endemic {{species of the}} Indian subcontinent, is declining in its natural habitats. The Great Indian Bustard is a bird of open land and was observed using the grasslands habitat (73 %), followed by areas covered with Prosopis (11 %). In the grasslands, the communities dominated with Cymbopogon martinii were utilized the highest, while those dominated by Aristida adenemsoidis were least utilized. As Cymbopogon martinii is non-palatable, we infer {{that it does not}} attract livestock and herdsmen resulting in minimum movement and trampling that favors the Great Indian Bustard...|$|R
50|$|Maharashtra {{is one of}} the {{six states}} of India where great Indian {{bustards}} (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>nigriceps)</b> are still seen. The great Indian bustard at Nannaj and Karmala was first identified By Mr B.S.Kulkarni in 1972 and with his constant efforts to save the bird had resulted in Dr. Salim Ali visiting Nannaj and starting a research project. Mr Kulkarni wrote extensively in local newspapers and made people aware of its existence and he is still active in trying to protect the bird and its habitat at Nannaj, near Solapur. In former days the bustard was a common bird in the dry districts of Maharashtra.|$|R
50|$|The Great Indian Bustard (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>nigriceps)</b> or Indian bustard is a bustard {{found in}} India and the {{adjoining}} regions of Pakistan. A large bird with a horizontal body and long bare legs, giving it an ostrich like appearance, this bird {{is among the}} heaviest of the flying birds. Once common on the dry plains of the Indian subcontinent, as few as 250 individuals were estimated in 2011 to survive and the species is critically endangered by hunting and loss of its habitat, which consists of large expanses of dry grassland and scrub. These birds are often found associated in the same habitat as blackbuck. It is protected under Wildlife Protection Act 1972 of India.|$|R
50|$|Ravi Sankaran (October 4, 1963 - January 17, 2009) was an Indian ornithologist {{whose work}} {{concerned}} {{the conservation of}} several threatened birds of India. He was the Director of the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. Ravi studied at the Rishi Valley School, Madanapalli, Andhra Pradesh; obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Zoology from Loyola College, Chennai and a doctorate from Bombay Natural History Society Ravi joined the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) in 1985 in the endangered species project on the great Indian bustard (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>nigriceps)</b> and florican species (family Otididae) and {{played a role in}} developing recovery plans for these species. He also established Florican Watch, involving local people.|$|R
50|$|The huge {{adult male}} great bustard is {{possibly}} the heaviest living flying animal. It is also {{arguably the most}} sexual dimorphic extant bird species, {{in terms of the}} size difference between males and females. Going on mass, the only known bird with a higher dimorphism is the green peafowl (Pavo muticus) as the males are apparently near four times as heavy as the female. Among both bustards and all living birds, the upper reported mass of this species is rivaled by that of the kori bustard (Ardeotis kori), which, due to its relatively longer tarsi and tail, is both longer and taller on average and is less sexually dimorphic. In terms of weight ranges reported, the great Indian bustard (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>nigriceps)</b> also only lags slightly behind these species. A male is typically 90 - 105 cm tall, with a length of around 115 cm and has a 2.1 - 2.7 m wingspan. The male can range in weight from 5.8 to 18 kg. Average male weights as reported have been fairly variable: in Russia, males weighed a median of 9.2 kg; in Spain, males weighed a mean of 9.82 kg during breeding season and 10.62 kg during non-breeding; in Germany, males weighed a mean of 11.97 kg; and the Guinness World Records has indicated that prior to their extirpation male bustards in Great Britain weighed an average of 13.5 kg. In a study in Spain, one male weighed as much as 19 kg. The heaviest verified specimen, collected in Manchuria, was about 21 kg. Larger specimens have been reported but remain unverified.|$|R
40|$|Parasitic wasps {{attack a}} number of insect species on which they feed, either {{externally}} or internally. This requires very effective strategies for suppressing the immune response and a finely tuned interference with the host physiology that is co-opted for the developing parasitoid progeny. The wealth of physiological host alterations is mediated by virulence factors encoded by the wasp or, in some cases, by polydnaviruses (PDVs), unique viral symbionts injected into the host at oviposition along with the egg, venom and ovarian secretions. PDVs {{are among the most}} powerful immunosuppressors in nature, targeting insect defense barriers at different levels. During my PhD research program I have used Drosophila melanogaster as a model to expand the functional analysis of virulence factors encoded by PDV focusing on the molecular processes underlying the disruption of the host endocrine system. I focused my research on a member of the ankyrin (ank) gene family, an immunosuppressant found in bracovirus, which associates with the parasitic wasp Toxoneuron <b>nigriceps.</b> <b>I</b> found that ankyrin disrupts ecdysone biosynthesis by impairing the vesicular traffic of ecdysteroid precursors in the cells of the prothoracic gland and results in developmental arrest. ...|$|R
